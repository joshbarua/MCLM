# Given the point $(0,3)$, we can see that $x = 0$ and $y = 3$.
# We can calculate $r$ using the formula:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]
# Since $x = 0$ and $y > 0$, we can determine $\theta$ using the case for $x = 0$ and $y > 0$:

We are given two infinite series definitions: $p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$. We need to express the double infinite series $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ in terms of $p$ and $q$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the double sum as follows:
\[
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3},
\]
where we have changed the order of summation by letting $n = j + k$, so $j$ ranges from 1 to $n-1$ and $n$ ranges from 2 to $\infty$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The inner sum can be simplified as:
\[
\sum_{j = 1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{j = 1}^{n-1} 1 = \frac{n-1}{n^3}.
\]
So, the double sum becomes:
\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right).
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can split the sum into two separate sums:
\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right) = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]
We can rewrite these sums in terms of $p$ and $q$ by noting that:
\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We will calculate $f(-2)$, $f(-1)$, and $f(0)$ using the given function $f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2}$.

First, calculate $f(-2)$:
\[ f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2 \]

Next, calculate $f(-1)$:
\[ f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Finally, calculate $f(0)$:
\[ f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1 \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1 = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \frac{14}{3} \]

The problem asks for the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196. To solve this, we need to find the prime factorization of 196 and then use the formula for the number of divisors.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 196. We start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 196 \div 2 = 98 \]
\[ 98 \div 2 = 49 \]
49 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 7:
\[ 49 \div 7 = 7 \]
\[ 7 \div 7 = 1 \]
So, the prime factorization of 196 is:
\[ 196 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \]

[ADVANCE]

The formula to find the number of divisors of a number from its prime factorization is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results. For the prime factorization \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_n^{e_n} \), the number of divisors is given by \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_n + 1) \).

For \( 196 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \), the exponents are 2 and 2. Applying the formula, we get:
\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

So, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.

The problem presents a graph showing the results of a cross-country team's training run, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing distance. We need to determine which student has the greatest average speed.

To find the average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

From the graph, we can see that all students ran for the same amount of time, which is 6 units (from time 0 to time 6).

Next, we need to find the total distance each student ran by looking at the y-coordinate of each student's point on the graph.

The distances run by each student are:
- Evelyn: 4.5 units
- Briana: 2.2 units
- Carla: 5.2 units
- Debra: 2.8 units
- Angela: 1.4 units

Since the time is the same for all students, the student with the greatest distance run will have the greatest average speed.

Comparing the distances, we see that Carla ran the farthest distance of 5.2 units.

Therefore, the student with the greatest average speed is Carla.

The problem involves finding the perimeter of a regular hexagon given the perimeter of one of its equilateral triangles. We know that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, so the side length of the hexagon is the same as the side length of each triangle.

[ADVANCE]

The perimeter of one of the equilateral triangles is given as 21 inches. Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can find the side length of the triangle by dividing the perimeter by 3. Let's calculate the side length of the triangle:
\[
\text{Side length of the triangle} = \frac{\text{Perimeter of the triangle}}{3} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]
Since the side length of the hexagon is the same as the side length of the triangle, the side length of the hexagon is also 7 inches.

[ADVANCE]

A regular hexagon has six equal sides. To find the perimeter of the hexagon, we multiply the side length of the hexagon by 6:
\[
\text{Perimeter of the hexagon} = 6 \times \text{Side length of the hexagon} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ inches}

The problem asks for the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The sum of these integers is \((n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n\).

We need to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed in the form \(3n\), where \(n\) is an integer. This means the perfect cube must be divisible by 3.

[ADVANCE]

The smallest positive perfect cube is \(1^3 = 1\), but it is not divisible by 3. The next perfect cube is \(2^3 = 8\), which is also not divisible by 3. The next perfect cube is \(3^3 = 27\), which is divisible by 3.

Since \(27\) is a perfect cube and is divisible by 3, it can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. We can verify this by finding the value of \(n\): \(3n = 27 \implies n = 9\). The three consecutive integers are \(8\), \(9\), and \(10\), and their sum is indeed \(8 + 9 + 10 = 27\).

The problem involves finding the angle between two lines in 3D space, which are defined by the sets of points satisfying two different equations. To find the angle between the lines, we need to determine the direction vectors of the lines and then use the formula for the angle between two vectors.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first line is defined by the equations $2x = 3y = -z$. We can express this line in parametric form by setting $2x = 3y = -z = t$, where $t$ is a parameter. Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = \frac{t}{2}, \quad y = \frac{t}{3}, \quad z = -t.\]
So, the direction vector of the first line is $\mathbf{d_1} = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)$ or, equivalently, $\mathbf{d_1} = (3, 2, -6)$ (by multiplying through by 6 to clear the fractions).

The second line is defined by the equations $6x = -y = -4z$. We can express this line in parametric form by setting $6x = -y = -4z = s$, where $s$ is a parameter. Solving for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:
\[x = \frac{s}{6}, \quad y = -s, \quad z = -\frac{s}{4}.\]
So, the direction vector of the second line is $\mathbf{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)$ or, equivalently, $\mathbf{d_2} = (2, -12, -3)$ (by multiplying through by 12 to clear the fractions).

Next, we can use the formula for the angle $\theta$ between two vectors $\mathbf{d_1}$ and $\mathbf{d_2}$:
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2}}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\| \|\mathbf{d_2}\|}.\]

[ADVANCE]

The dot product of $\mathbf{d_1}$ and $\mathbf{d_2}$ is:
\[\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2} = (3)(2) + (2)(-12) + (-6)(-3) = 6 - 24 + 18 = 0.\]

The magnitudes of $\mathbf{d_1}$ and $\mathbf{d_2}$ are:
\[\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7,\]
\[\|\mathbf{d_2}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-12)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 144 + 9} = \sqrt{157}.\]

So, the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between the two lines is:
\[\cos \theta = \frac{0}{7 \sqrt{157}} = 0.\]

Since $\cos \theta = 0$, the angle $\theta$ is:
\[\theta = \cos^{-1}(0) = 90^\circ.\]

[ADVANCE]

Let's analyze the expression step by step. The original expression without any parentheses is $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$, which evaluates to $120 + 1 = 121$.

We can insert parentheses in various places to change the order of operations. Let's consider the possible placements of parentheses:

1. $(2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5) + 1$ (no change, evaluates to 121)
2. $(2\cdot 3\cdot 4)\cdot (5 + 1)$ (evaluates to $24\cdot 6 = 144$)
3. $(2\cdot 3)\cdot (4\cdot 5 + 1)$ (evaluates to $6\cdot 21 = 126$)
4. $2\cdot (3\cdot 4\cdot 5 + 1)$ (evaluates to $2\cdot 61 = 122$)
5. $2\cdot (3\cdot 4)\cdot (5 + 1)$ (evaluates to $2\cdot 12\cdot 6 = 144$)
6. $2\cdot (3\cdot (4\cdot 5 + 1))$ (evaluates to $2\cdot 3\cdot 21 = 126$)
7. $2\cdot ((3\cdot 4)\cdot 5 + 1)$ (evaluates to $2\cdot 60 + 1 = 121$)
8. $(2\cdot 3)\cdot (4\cdot (5 + 1))$ (evaluates to $6\cdot 4\cdot 6 = 144$)
9. $2\cdot (3\cdot (4\cdot 5))\cdot 1$ (evaluates to $2\cdot 60\cdot 1 = 120$ is not valid since the +1 is not included in the multiplication)

We can see that the possible values obtained are 121, 122, 126, and 144.

By considering all the possible placements of parentheses, we have found that the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ can be evaluated to four distinct values: 121, 122, 126, and 144.

Therefore, the total number of values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is 4.

The problem requires finding the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. To be a multiple of 30, the number must be a multiple of both 3 and 10. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 3 and 10.

[ADVANCE]

1. To be a multiple of 10, the number must end in 0.
2. To be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits must be a sum of 2's that is a multiple of 3.

We are given a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree 5 such that $p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}$ for $n = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7$. We need to find $p(8)$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's define a new polynomial $q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x$. This polynomial will be of degree 7 because it is the product of a degree 2 polynomial ($x^2 - 1$) and a degree 5 polynomial ($p(x)$), minus a degree 1 polynomial ($x$).

We know that $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ because $p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}$ for these values of $n$. Additionally, $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1$ and $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) - (-1) = 1$.

Since $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7 and we have 7 roots ($2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$), we can express $q(x)$ as:
\[q(x) = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)(x - r)\]
for some constant $c$ and an unknown root $r$.

[ADVANCE]

We can determine the constant $c$ by using the values of $q(1)$ and $q(-1)$. First, let's find $q(1)$ and $q(-1)$ in terms of $c$ and $r$:
\[q(1) = c(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7)(1 - r) = -1\]
\[q(1) = c(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(1 - r) = -1\]
\[q(1) = c \cdot 720 \cdot (1 - r) = -1\]
\[c \cdot 720 \cdot (1 - r) = -1 \quad \text{(1)}\]

Similarly, for $q(-1)$:
\[q(-1) = c(-1 - 2)(-1 - 3)(-1 - 4)(-1 - 5)(-1 - 6)(-1 - 7)(-1 - r) = 1\]
\[q(-1) = c(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8)(-1 - r) = 1\]
\[q(-1) = c \cdot (-6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8) \cdot (-1 - r) = 1\]
\[q(-1) = c \cdot (-336) \cdot (-1 - r) = 1\]
\[c \cdot 336 \cdot (1 + r) = 1 \quad \text{(2)}\]

Now we have two equations:
\[c \cdot 720 \cdot (1 - r) = -1\]
\[c \cdot 336 \cdot (1 + r) = 1\]

We can solve these equations to find $c$ and $r$.

[ADVANCE]

Divide the first equation by the second equation:
\[\frac{c \cdot 720 \cdot (1 - r)}{c \cdot 336 \cdot (1 + r)} = \frac{-1}{1}\]
\[\frac{720(1 - r)}{336(1 + r)} = -1\]
\[\frac{15(1 - r)}{7(1 + r)} = -1\]
\[15(1 - r) = -7(1 + r)\]
\[15 - 15r = -7 - 7r\]
\[15 + 7 = 15r - 7r\]
\[22 = 8r\]
\[r = \frac{22}{8} = \frac{11}{4}\]

Now substitute $r = \frac{11}{4}$ into one of the original equations to find $c$. Using the first equation:
\[c \cdot 720 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{11}{4}\right) = -1\]
\[c \cdot 720 \cdot \left(\frac{4 - 11}{4}\right) = -1\]
\[c \cdot 720 \cdot \left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) = -1\]
\[c \cdot (-1260) = -1\]
\[c = \frac{1}{1260}\]

Now that we have $c$ and $r$, we can express $q(x)$ as:
\[q(x) = \frac{1}{1260}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)\left(x - \frac{11}{4}\right)\]

Since $q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x$, we can find $p(x)$:
\[(x^2 - 1)p(x) = q(x) + x\]
\[p(x) = \frac{q(x) + x}{x^2 - 1}\]

We need to find $p(8)$:
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \frac{q(8) + 8}{63}\]
\[q(8) = \frac{1}{1260}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7)\left(8 - \frac{11}{4}\right)\]
\[q(8) = \frac{1}{1260}(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)\left(\frac{32 - 11}{4}\right)\]
\[q(8) = \frac{1}{1260} \cdot 720 \cdot \frac{21}{4}\]
\[q(8) = \frac{1}{1260} \cdot 720 \cdot \frac{21}{4} = \frac{720 \cdot 21}{1260 \cdot 4} = \frac{15120}{5040} = 3\]

So, $p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{63} = \frac{3 + 8}{63} = \frac{11}{63}$.

[ADVANCE]
To find the sum of the proper divisors of 284, we first need to identify all the proper divisors of 284. The proper divisors of 284 are the positive divisors of 284 that are less than 284. We start by finding the prime factorization of 284.

The prime factorization of 284 is:
\[ 284 = 2^2 \times 71 \]

Using the prime factorization, we can find the sum of all divisors of 284. The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k} \) is given by:
\[ (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \cdots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_2^{a_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \cdots + p_k^{a_k}) \]

For \( 284 = 2^2 \times 71 \), the sum of the divisors is:
\[ (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 71) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 71) = 7 \times 72 = 504 \]

The sum of the proper divisors of 284 is the sum of all divisors minus 284 itself:
\[ 504 - 284 = 220 \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. We start by finding the prime factorization of 220.

The prime factorization of 220 is:
\[ 220 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 11 \]

Using the prime factorization, we can find the sum of all divisors of 220:
\[ (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5)(1 + 11) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5)(1 + 11) = 7 \times 6 \times 12 = 504 \]

The sum of the proper divisors of 220 is the sum of all divisors minus 220 itself:
\[ 504 - 220 = 284 \]

Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.

We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\angle EFD = 90^\circ$, and $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can use the given value of $\sin D$ to find the length of $DF$. We know that $EF = 7$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7

Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the result $w$ when $z$ is rotated around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counter-clockwise.

To solve this, we can use the concept of complex number rotation. The rotation of a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by the formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
where $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. For a counter-clockwise rotation of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

We need to calculate $z - c$ first:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) - 3 \sqrt{2} i \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i (1 + i) \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = 1 - 2i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

"To find the smallest possible value of \( c \) for the given graph of \( y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \), we need to analyze the graph and extract the necessary information.

From the graph, we can observe the following:

1. The amplitude \( a \) is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) point. In this case, the amplitude is 2.
2. The vertical shift \( d \) is the midline of the graph. Here, the midline is \( y = 1 \), so \( d = 1 \).
3. The period of the graph is the distance over which the graph repeats. For the standard sine function, the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{b} \). From the graph, we can see that the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \), so \( b = 3 \).
4. The phase shift \( c \) can be determined by finding the horizontal shift of the graph. The standard sine function \( \sin x \) has its maximum at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \). For the given graph, the maximum occurs at \( x = -\frac{\pi}{6} \). The phase shift \( c \) can be calculated using the formula \( -\frac{c}{b} \). Since the maximum of \( \sin x \) occurs at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we can set up the equation \( -\frac{\pi}{6} = -\frac{c}{3} \), which gives \( c = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

However, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( c \). Since the sine function is periodic, we can express the phase shift in terms of the period. The phase shift \( c \) can be expressed as \( c = \frac{\pi}{2} - 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \). To find the smallest positive value of \( c \), we can set \( k = 0 \), which gives \( c = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Let's verify this using Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x = sp.symbols('x')
a, b, c, d = sp.symbols('a b c d')

# Define the function
f = a * sp.sin(b * x + c) + d

# Given values from the graph
a_val = 2
b_val = 3

# The maximum of the sine function occurs at x = -pi/6
max_x = -sp.pi / 6

# Calculate the phase shift c

# Simplify the value of c

The problem involves finding the measure of angle \( x \) in a geometric figure where \( \overline{BC} \) is parallel to the segment through \( A \), and \( AB = BC \).

- \( AB = BC \), making \( \triangle ABC \) an isosceles triangle.

Objective:
- Find the measure of angle \( x \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since \( \overline{BC} \) is parallel to the segment through \( A \), the angle formed by the segment through \( A \) and \( \overline{AB} \) is equal to the angle formed by \( \overline{BC} \) and \( \overline{AB} \), which is \( 124^\circ \). This means the angle at \( B \) in \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 180^\circ - 124^\circ = 56^\circ \).

In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Let the base angles at \( B \) and \( C \) be \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \), respectively. Since \( AB = BC \), we have \( \angle B = \angle C \).

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ \]
Substituting \( \angle B = \angle C \) and \( \angle A = x \), we get:
\[ x + 56^\circ + 56^\circ = 180^\circ \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 112^\circ = 180^\circ \]

The problem involves finding the smallest possible value of a positive real number \(a\) such that all the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) are real. We need to analyze the properties of the polynomial and its roots.

[ADVANCE]

Given the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\), we can use the fact that if \(r\) is a root, then \(r \neq 0\) (since the constant term is 1). We can divide the polynomial equation by \(x\) to get:
\[x^2 + ax + a + \frac{1}{x} = 0.\]
However, this approach seems complicated. Instead, let's consider the factorization of the polynomial. If all roots are real, we can express the polynomial as \((x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3) = 0\), where \(r_1, r_2, r_3\) are the real roots.

Expanding the product, we get:
\[x^3 + (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)x^2 + (r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1)x + r_1r_2r_3 = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1.\]
By comparing coefficients, we obtain:
\[r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = a,\]
\[r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = a,\]
\[r_1r_2r_3 = 1.\]

[ADVANCE]

Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:
\[\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{r_1r_2r_3}.\]
Since \(r_1r_2r_3 = 1\), we get:
\[\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{1} = 1,\]
which implies:
\[r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \geq 3.\]
Since \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = a\), we have:
\[a \geq 3.\]

Next, we need to check if \(a = 3\) is achievable. If \(a = 3\), then by the equality condition of the AM-GM inequality, we must have \(r_1 = r_2 = r_3\). Since \(r_1r_2r_3 = 1\), we get \(r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 1\). However, substituting \(x = -1\) into the polynomial \(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\) gives us:
\[(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = -1 + 3 - 3 + 1 = 0,\]
so \(x = -1\) is a root, not \(x = 1\). Therefore, we need to reconsider the roots.

Let's check the case when the roots are \(-1, -1, -1\). The polynomial would be \((x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\), which matches the form \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1\) when \(a = 3\).

Thus, the smallest possible value of \(a\) is indeed 3.

We will also need to evaluate the expression \((\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) to help us find the desired value.

Let's denote \(a = \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5}\) and \(b = \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}\). We are interested in finding \(a^6\). Notice that \(a^6 + b^6\) can be calculated using the binomial theorem. First, we need to find \(a^2\) and \(b^2\):
\[a^2 = (\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^2 = 7 + 2\sqrt{35} + 5 = 12 + 2\sqrt{35}\]
\[b^2 = (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^2 = 7 - 2\sqrt{35} + 5 = 12 - 2\sqrt{35}\]
Now, we can find \(a^2 + b^2\):
\[a^2 + b^2 = (12 + 2\sqrt{35}) + (12 - 2\sqrt{35}) = 24\]
Next, we find \(a^4 + b^4\):
\[a^4 + b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)^2 - 2a^2b^2 = 24^2 - 2(12 + 2\sqrt{35})(12 - 2\sqrt{35}) = 576 - 2(144 - 140) = 576 - 8 = 568\]
Finally, we find \(a^6 + b^6\):
\[a^6 + b^6 = (a^2 + b^2)(a^4 - a^2b^2 + b^4) = 24(a^4 + b^4 - a^2b^2) = 24(568 - (12 + 2\sqrt{35})(12 - 2\sqrt{35})) = 24(568 - 8) = 24 \cdot 560 = 13440\]
Since \(b = \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5} < 1\), we have \(b^6 < 1\). Therefore, \(a^6 = 13440 - b^6 > 13440 - 1 = 13439\). The greatest integer less than \(a^6\) is thus \(13439\).

[ADVANCE]
Let's denote the number of dogs Denali and Nate are responsible for as \( D \) and \( N \) respectively. Initially, \( D = 16 \) and \( N = 12 \).

The first scenario is that Denali starts walking \( 4x \) more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs. So, Denali's new total number of dogs is \( 16 + 4x \) and Nate's remains \( 12 \).

The second scenario is that \( x \) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. So, Denali's new total number of dogs is \( 16 + x \) and Nate's new total number of dogs is \( 12 - x \).

The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same as the ratio of the number of dogs they are responsible for. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the two scenarios:

\[
\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x}
\]

[ADVANCE]
Now, we solve the equation for \( x \):

\[
(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
192 + 48x - 16x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x

Subtracting 192 from both sides:

\[

Rearranging the terms:

\[

[ADVANCE]

First, isolate the square root term on one side of the equation:
\[ x - 4 = \sqrt{11-2x} \]

Next, square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:
\[ (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \]
\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \]
\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \]

Now, we can factor the quadratic equation:
\[ (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 \]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ x = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 \]

[VERIFY]

We need to check if both solutions satisfy the original equation, as squaring both sides of the equation can introduce extraneous solutions.

For $x = 5$:
\[ 5 = \sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 \]
\[ 5 = \sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 \]
\[ 5 = \sqrt{1} + 4 \]
\[ 5 = 1 + 4 \]
\[ 5 = 5 \]
So, $x = 5$ is a valid solution.

For $x = 1$:
\[ 1 = \sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 \]
\[ 1 = \sqrt{11 - 2} + 4 \]
\[ 1 = \sqrt{9} + 4 \]
\[ 1 = 3 + 4 \]
\[ 1 = 7 \]
This is a contradiction, so $x = 1$ is not a valid solution.

The worker deposits $\$20{,}000$ at the end of each year, and he wants to have at least $\$66{,}200$ in the account by the end of the third year.

[ADVANCE]
Let's denote the annual compound interest rate by $r$. The worker's deposits can be treated as a series of future values of an annuity. The future value of the deposits at the end of the third year can be calculated as follows:
- The first deposit of $\$20{,}000$ made at the end of the first year will grow to $\$20{,}000 \cdot (1+r)^2$ by the end of the third year.
- The second deposit of $\$20{,}000$ made at the end of the second year will grow to $\$20{,}000 \cdot (1+r)$ by the end of the third year.
- The third deposit of $\$20{,}000$ made at the end of the third year will be $\$20{,}000$.

The total amount in the account at the end of the third year is the sum of these future values:
\[ 20{,}000 \cdot (1+r)^2 + 20{,}000 \cdot (1+r) + 20{,}000 \geq 66{,}200. \]
We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by $20{,}000$:
\[ (1+r)^2 + (1+r) + 1 \geq 3.31. \]

[ADVANCE]
Let's solve the inequality:
\[ (1+r)^2 + (1+r) + 1 - 3.31 \geq 0, \]
\[ (1+r)^2 + (1+r) - 2.31 \geq 0. \]
We can solve the corresponding equation:
\[ (1+r)^2 + (1+r) - 2.31 = 0. \]
Let $x = 1+r$. Then the equation becomes:
\[ x^2 + x - 2.31 = 0. \]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -2.31$:
\[ x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 2.31}}{2}, \]
\[ x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 9.24}}{2}, \]
\[ x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{10.24}}{2}, \]
\[ x = \frac{-1 \pm 3.2}{2}. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = \frac{-1 + 3.2}{2} = \frac{2.2}{2} = 1.1, \]
\[ x = \frac{-1 - 3.2}{2} = \frac{-4.2}{2} = -2.1. \]
Since $x = 1+r$ and $r$ is a interest rate, it must be non-negative. Therefore, we take the positive solution:
\[ 1+r = 1.1, \]
\[ r = 0.1. \]
To find the minimal compound interest rate as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ r = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%. \]

Let's start by substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the functional equation to find $f(0)$:
\[f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - 0 \cdot 0 - 1 \implies 2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1.\]
Now, let's substitute $y = 1$ into the functional equation to get a relationship involving $f(x+1)$:
\[f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1 \implies f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2.\]
This gives us a recursive relationship for $f(x)$ when $x$ is incremented by 1.

We can use the recursive relationship to find $f(n)$ for positive integers $n$. Starting from $f(1) = 1$, we can calculate:

\[f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 4 = 8,\]
\[f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 5 = 13.\]
We can also try to find a general formula for $f(n)$. Using the recursive relationship $f(x+1) = f(x) + x + 2$, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
\[f(2) - f(1) = 1 + 2,\]
\[f(3) - f(2) = 2 + 2,\]
\[f(4) - f(3) = 3 + 2,\]
\[\vdots\]
\[f(n) - f(n-1) = (n-1) + 2.\]
Summing these equations, we get:
\[f(n) - f(1) = (1 + 2) + (2 + 2) + \cdots + ((n-1) + 2) = (1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1)) + 2(n-1) = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + 2(n-1) = \frac{n^2 - n + 4n - 4}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2}.\]
Since $f(1) = 1$, we have:
\[f(n) = 1 + \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}.\]
We need to find integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n$:
\[\frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} = n \implies n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n \implies n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \implies (n + 2)(n - 1) = 0.\]

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling cookies. The math club sold 54 cookies at three for $1, so the number of sets of three cookies sold is $54 \div 3 = 18$. Since each set costs $1, the total revenue from cookies is $18 \times 1 = 18$ dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cupcakes. The math club sold 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so the total revenue from cupcakes is $20 \times 2 = 40$ dollars.

Then, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies. The math club sold 35 brownies at $1 each, so the total revenue from brownies is $35 \times 1 = 35$ dollars.

The problem involves rotating the complex number $7 + 2i$ by $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise around the origin. This rotation can be represented by multiplying the complex number by $i$, since a $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise rotation is equivalent to multiplying by the imaginary unit.

To find the resulting complex number, we multiply $7 + 2i$ by $i$:

The problem involves selecting a group of soldiers from two categories: upper class and lower class. We need to determine the number of different battalions that can be formed given the constraints of the battle of Thermopylae.

[ADVANCE]

The battle of Thermopylae requires a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers. We have 5 upper class soldiers and 10 lower class soldiers available in a certain part of Athens.

To find the number of different battalions that can be sent, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers out of 5 and the number of ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers out of 10.

The number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers out of 5 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers out of 5 is $\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = 5$.

The number of ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers out of 10 is $\binom{10}{8} = \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \frac{10!}{8!2!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45$.

Since the choices of upper class and lower class soldiers are independent, the total number of different battalions that can be sent is the product of the number of ways to choose the upper class soldiers and the number of ways to choose the lower class soldiers. Therefore, the total number of different battalions is $5 \times 45 = 225$.

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:

Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:

1. Treat the group of 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who want to sit together as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 ""people"" (5 individual people plus the block of 3) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange \(n\) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" is \((6-1)! = 5!\).
3. Within the block of 3 people, there are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.

The problem presents a geometric sequence with the first term \(a = \frac{125}{9}\) and we need to find the eighth term of the sequence. To do this, we must determine the common ratio \(r\) of the sequence.

[ADVANCE]
The common ratio \(r\) of a geometric sequence can be found by dividing the second term by the first term. So, we calculate:
\[ r = \frac{\frac{25}{3}}{\frac{125}{9}} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{125} = \frac{25 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 125} = \frac{225}{375} = \frac{3}{5} \]
Now that we have the common ratio \(r = \frac{3}{5}\), we can use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence, which is given by:
\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \]
We need to find the eighth term, so we substitute \(n = 8\), \(a = \frac{125}{9}\), and \(r = \frac{3}{5}\) into the formula:
\[ a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{8-1} = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7 \]
[ADVANCE]
Now, we simplify the expression:
\[ a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{3^7}{5^7} = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{2187}{78125} = \frac{125 \cdot 2187}{9 \cdot 78125} = \frac{273375}{703125} \]
We can simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 273375 and 703125 is 375, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 375:
\[ a_8 = \frac{273375 \div 375}{703125 \div 375} = \frac{729}{1875} \]
We can simplify further by finding the GCD of 729 and 1875, which is 3. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[ a_8 = \frac{729 \div 3}{1875 \div 3} = \frac{243}{625} \]

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3}10^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^{15-5\cdot3} = \binom{5}{3}10^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^0
\]
Calculating the value, we have:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5\cdot4}{2} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}

So, the constant term is:
\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

[ADVANCE]

First, let's rewrite the equation by substituting $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7$. This gives us $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3$, since $2x - 10 = (x - 3) + (x - 7)$.

Expanding the right-hand side, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$. Simplifying, we find $0 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2$, which can be factored as $0 = 3ab(a + b)$.

This equation gives us three possible solutions: $a = 0$, $b = 0$, or $a + b = 0$.

Now, we substitute back $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7$ to find the values of $x$.

1. If $a = 0$, then $x - 3 = 0$, so $x = 3$.
2. If $b = 0$, then $x - 7 = 0$, so $x = 7$.
3. If $a + b = 0$, then $(x - 3) + (x - 7) = 0$, so $2x - 10 = 0$, and thus $x = 5$.

The problem involves finding the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides of equal length and 5 equal interior angles. When rotated about its center, the pentagon will coincide with its original position when the rotation angle is a multiple of the central angle subtended by one of its sides.

The central angle of a regular pentagon can be calculated as \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \). This is the angle by which the pentagon needs to be rotated to bring one vertex to the position of the next vertex.

To find the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to find the smallest rotation angle that is a multiple of the central angle and brings the pentagon back to its original position. Since the pentagon has 5-fold rotational symmetry, the minimum rotation angle is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \times 5 = 360^\circ \), but we can also consider the rotation by one full cycle of the symmetry, which is the same as the central angle times the number of sides, but the smallest one is the central angle itself times the number of times it repeats to get back to the original, that is 72 degrees times 5/5 or just full 360/5.

However, the question asks for the minimum degrees, so we need the smallest angle, which is the central angle itself.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is the central angle itself, which is \( 72^\circ \).

However, we need to confirm if this is indeed the minimum angle that brings the pentagon back to its original position.

Next action: [VERIFY]

We have calculated the central angle of the pentagon as \( 72^\circ \), which is the angle between two adjacent vertices. Rotating the pentagon by \( 72^\circ \) will bring one vertex to the position of the next vertex, but it will not coincide with the original position of the pentagon. To coincide with the original position, the pentagon needs to be rotated by an angle that is a multiple of the central angle and brings all vertices back to their original positions. The smallest such angle is indeed \( 360^\circ \), but we can also consider the rotational symmetry of the pentagon, which is \( 72^\circ \times 5 = 360^\circ \). However, the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of \( 72^\circ \times 5/5 = 72^\circ \) times 1 which is not the case, it will be after \( 72 \times 5/5 \) which is 360/5 =72.

However, we can also check the option of 360/5 =72.

The answer seems to be correct as the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of \( 72^\circ \).

\[ 6432 \div 132 = 48 \text{ with a remainder of } 96. \]

Next, we divide 96 by 36:
\[ 96 \div 36 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 24. \]

Next, we divide 36 by 24:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$. The midpoint formula is given by:
\[
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]
So, the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3 + y}{2} = 6

Solving these equations, we get:

5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8

The constraints are $0 \le x \le 40$ and $0 \le y \le 50$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression inside the third square root as:
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100 = (x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2 + 100.
\]
This suggests a geometric interpretation. Let's consider the points $A = (0, 20)$, $B = (0, 50)$, $C = (40, 0)$, $D = (x, 0)$, and $E = (x, y)$. The expression can be interpreted as the sum of the distances from point $E$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$.

The expression becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2 + 100}.
\]
We can see that the point $E = (x, y)$ should be chosen such that the sum of these distances is minimized.

[ADVANCE]

By the triangle inequality, the minimum value of the sum of the distances from point $E$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is the distance from point $A$ to point $C$ plus the distance from point $B$ to point $C$. This is because the shortest path between two points is a straight line.

The distance from point $A = (0, 20)$ to point $C = (40, 0)$ is:
\[
\sqrt{(40 - 0)^2 + (0 - 20)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} = 20\sqrt{5}.
\]
The distance from point $B = (0, 50)$ to point $C = (40, 0)$ is:
\[
\sqrt{(40 - 0)^2 + (0 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 2500} = \sqrt{4100} = 10\sqrt{41}.
\]
However, we need to consider the third term in the expression, which is $\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2 + 100}$. When $x = 40$ and $y = 50$, this term becomes $\sqrt{0 + 0 + 100} = 10$.

So, the minimum value of the expression is:
\[
20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{41} - 10 + 10 = 20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{41}.
\]
However, we need to verify if this is indeed the minimum value.

[VERIFY]

We have considered the geometric interpretation of the problem and used the triangle inequality to find the minimum value. We have also evaluated the expression at the point $(x, y) = (40, 50)$ to find the minimum value.

After re-evaluating the expression and the constraints, we can conclude that the minimum value of the expression is indeed achieved when $x = 40$ and $y = 50$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is:
\[
\sqrt{40^2 + 400} + \sqrt{50^2 + 900} + \sqrt{40^2 + 50^2 - 80 \cdot 40 - 100 \cdot 50 + 4100} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} + \sqrt{2500 + 900} + \sqrt{1600 + 2500 - 3200 - 5000 + 4100} = \sqrt{2000} + \sqrt{3400} + \sqrt{100} = 20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34} + 10.
\]
However, we can simplify it to:
\[
\sqrt{2000} + \sqrt{3400} + 10 = 20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34} + 10.
\]

The minimum value of the expression is $\boxed{70}$.

The problem involves determining the direct distance from Bill's starting point to his final position after walking in different directions. We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find this distance.

[ADVANCE]

1. First, let's calculate the total distance Bill walked south. He walked $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south initially and then another $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, so the total distance south is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$ mile.
2. The distance he walked east is $\frac{3}{4}$ mile.
3. We can visualize Bill's movement as a right-angled triangle, where the total distance south is one leg of the triangle, the distance east is the other leg, and the direct distance from his starting point to his final position is the hypotenuse.
4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the direct distance. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
5. Here, $a = 1$ mile (total distance south) and $b = \frac{3}{4}$ mile (distance east). So, the direct distance $c$ is given by $c = \sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{9}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{16} + \frac{9}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{25}}{\sqrt{16}} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25$ miles.

We are given a right triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, and we know that $\sin A = 2\cos A$. We need to find the value of $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the definition of sine and cosine in a right triangle to express $\sin A$ and $\cos A$ in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the side opposite to $\angle A$ as $a$, the side adjacent to $\angle A$ as $b$, and the hypotenuse as $c$. Then, we have:
\[
\sin A = \frac{a}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Given that $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can substitute the expressions for sine and cosine:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a = 2b
\]
We need to find $\tan A$, which is defined as:
\[
\tan A = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Since we have $a = 2b$, we can substitute this into the expression for $\tan A$:

The problem asks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots of \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are \( n^{\text{th}} \) roots of unity. To solve this, we need to find the roots of the given equation and determine the smallest \( n \) for which these roots are also \( n^{\text{th}} \) roots of unity.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \). We can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let \( y = z^2 \), then the equation becomes \( y^2 + y + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula:
\[ y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]
So, \( z^2 = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) or \( z^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

The complex numbers \( \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the non-real cube roots of unity, which can be written as \( e^{2\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{-2\pi i / 3} \), respectively. Therefore, the roots of the original equation are:
\[ z = \pm e^{\pi i / 3}, \pm e^{-\pi i / 3}. \]

These roots are also roots of unity. We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that these roots satisfy \( z^n = 1 \). The roots \( e^{\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{-\pi i / 3} \) are 12th roots of unity because:
\[ \left(e^{\pi i / 3}\right)^{12} = e^{4\pi i} = (e^{2\pi i})^2 = 1^2 = 1, \]
and similarly for \( e^{-\pi i / 3} \).

To confirm that 12 is the smallest such \( n \), we note that the roots are primitive 12th roots of unity, meaning they are not \( k \)-th roots of unity for any \( k < 12 \).

The smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots of \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are \( n^{\text{th}} \) roots of unity is \( \boxed{12} \).

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function $f(x)=\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$ and then summing the values of the asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is $x^2-5x-14$. We can factor this quadratic expression to find its roots.

The quadratic expression $x^2-5x-14$ can be factored as $(x-7)(x+2)$. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes occur at $x=7$ and $x=-2$. So, we have $a=7$ and $b=-2$.

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ depends on the degrees of the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$. So, we have $c=0$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the sum of the asymptotes $a+b+c$. We have $a=7$, $b=-2$, and $c=0$. Therefore, the sum is $7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$.

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: $2x = 3$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{3}{2}$.

The equation can be written as:

\[
x - 9 = 74

The problem involves redistributing coins from seven bags to eight bags, including a new bag of 53 coins, such that all eight bags have the same number of coins. We need to find the smallest number of coins that could have been in each of the original seven bags.

Let's denote the number of coins in each of the original seven bags as \( x \). The total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is \( 7x \). After finding the bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins becomes \( 7x + 53 \). This total number of coins is then redistributed equally among eight bags, so the number of coins in each bag after redistribution is \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \).

Since the number of coins in each bag after redistribution must be an integer, \( 7x + 53 \) must be divisible by 8. Additionally, we know that the total number of coins after redistribution is more than 200, so \( 8 \times \text{(number of coins in each bag)} > 200 \). This implies that the number of coins in each bag after redistribution is at least 25, because \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \), and we need more than 200 coins.

Therefore, \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \geq 25 \). We can solve this inequality to find the minimum value of \( x \).

[ADVANCE]

First, we solve the inequality \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \geq 25 \):

\[
7x + 53 \geq 200
\]

\[
7x \geq 147
\]

\[
x \geq 21
\]

Since \( 7x + 53 \) must be divisible by 8, we need to find the smallest integer \( x \geq 21 \) such that \( 7x + 53 \) is divisible by 8. We can check the values starting from \( x = 21 \):

For \( x = 21 \):

\[
7(21) + 53 = 147 + 53 = 200
\]

200 is divisible by 8, so \( x = 21 \) is a valid solution.

[OUTPUT]

The smallest number of coins that could have been in each of the original seven bags is \( x = 21 \). Therefore, the total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is \( 7x = 7 \times 21 = 147 \).

The problem asks for the quotient when the polynomial $x^6 - 3$ is divided by $x + 1$. This is a division problem involving polynomials, and we can use polynomial long division to solve it.

[ADVANCE]

To find the quotient, we can use polynomial long division. We divide $x^6 - 3$ by $x + 1$.

The first step in the division is to divide the leading term of the dividend ($x^6$) by the leading term of the divisor ($x$), which gives us $x^5$. We then multiply the entire divisor ($x + 1$) by $x^5$, which gives us $x^6 + x^5$. We subtract this from the original dividend ($x^6 - 3$), which gives us a new polynomial: $-x^5 - 3$.

We repeat the process by dividing the leading term of the new polynomial ($-x^5$) by the leading term of the divisor ($x$), which gives us $-x^4$. We then multiply the entire divisor ($x + 1$) by $-x^4$, which gives us $-x^5 - x^4$. We subtract this from the previous new polynomial ($-x^5 - 3$), which gives us a new polynomial: $x^4 - 3$.

We continue this process until we have divided the entire polynomial. The steps are as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Step} & \text{Quotient} \\
\hline
x^6 \div x = x^5 & x^5 \\
-x^5 - 3 \div x = -x^4 & -x^4 \\
x^4 \div x = x^3 & x^3 \\
-x^3 - 3 \div x = -x^2 & -x^2 \\
x^2 \div x = x & x \\
-x - 3 \div x = -1 & -1 \\
-1 - 3 \div x = -\frac{3}{x} & \text{remainder} \\
\end{array}
\]

Adding up all the terms in the quotient, we get: $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$.

The remainder is $-3 - (-1) = -2$.

So, the quotient when $x^6 - 3$ is divided by $x + 1$ is $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$.

First, let's calculate the value of the numerator $\sqrt{2.5^2-0.7^2}$. We can simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[2.5^2 = 6.25\]
\[0.7^2 = 0.49\]
\[2.5^2 - 0.7^2 = 6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76\]

The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable $x$ in the polynomial.

a^4 = a \cdot a^3 = a(3a^2 - 4a + 1) = 3a^3 - 4a^2 + a = 3(3a^2 - 4a + 1) - 4a^2 + a = 5a^2 - 11a + 3.
\]
Substituting $a^4$ into the expression for $a^6,$ we get:
\[
a^6 = 9(5a^2 - 11a + 3) - 24(3a^2 - 4a + 1) + 14a^2 - 8a + 1 = 45a^2 - 99a + 27 - 72a^2 + 96a - 24 + 14a^2 - 8a + 1 = -13a^2 +  -1a + 4.
\]
Similarly, we can calculate $a^9$ as:
\[
a^9 = a^3 \cdot a^6 = (3a^2 - 4a + 1)(-13a^2 - a + 4) = -39a^4 + 52a^3 - 12a^2 - 3a^3 + 4a^2 - a + 13a^2 + a - 4.
\]
Using $a^3 = 3a^2 - 4a + 1$ and $a^4 = 5a^2 - 11a + 3,$ we get:
\[
a^9 = -39(5a^2 - 11a + 3) + 49a^2 - 12a - 4 = -195a^2 + 429a - 117 + 49a^2 - 12a - 4 = -146a^2 + 417a - 121.
\]
Substituting $a^9,$ $a^6,$ and $a^3$ into the equation $a^9 + pa^6 + qa^3 + r = 0,$ we get:
\[
-146a^2 + 417a - 121 + p(-13a^2 - a + 4) + q(3a^2 - 4a + 1) + r = 0.
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
(-146 - 13p + 3q)a^2 + (417 - p - 4q)a + (-121 + 4p + q + r) = 0.
\]
Since this equation holds for all roots $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ of the polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1,$ the coefficients of the polynomial must be zero. Therefore, we have the system of equations:
\[
-146 - 13p + 3q = 0,
\]
\[
417 - p - 4q = 0,
\]
\[
-121 + 4p + q + r = 0.
\]
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$

[ADVANCE]

First, we solve the second equation for $p:$
\[
p = 417 - 4q.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-146 - 13(417 - 4q) + 3q = 0,
\]
\[
-146 - 5421 + 52q + 3q = 0,
\]
\[
-5567 + 55q = 0,
\]
\[
55q = 5567,
\]
\[
q = 101.
\]
Now, we substitute $q = 101$ back into the equation $p = 417 - 4q:$
\[
p = 417 - 4(101) = 417 - 404 = 13.
\]
Finally, we substitute $p = 13$ and $q = 101$ into the third equation to find $r:$
\[
-121 + 4(13) + 101 + r = 0,
\]
\[
-121 + 52 + 101 + r = 0,
\]
\[
32 + r = 0,
\]
\[
r = -32.
\]
Therefore, the ordered triple $(p,q,r)$ is $(13,101,-32).$

The final answer is: \boxed{(13,101,-32)}

Let the roots of the polynomial equation $8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0$ be $r$, $s$, and $t$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{4a}{8} = -\frac{a}{2}$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is $\frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4}$, and the product of the roots is $-\frac{a}{8}$.

We are given that the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5, i.e., $\log_2 r + \log_2 s + \log_2 t = 5$. Using the property of logarithms, this can be rewritten as $\log_2 (rst) = 5$, which implies $rst = 2^5 = 32$.

The problem asks us to factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible polynomials over the integers and then compute the sum of the values of these polynomials evaluated at \(x = 1\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can start by factoring the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) using the difference of squares:
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4)^2 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1).\]
Next, we can factor \(x^4 - 1\) further using the difference of squares:
\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1).\]
Now, we need to factor \(x^4 + 4\). We can use the Sophie Germain identity:
\[x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4 \cdot 1^4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]
So, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]

where \(p_1(x) = x - 1\), \(p_2(x) = x + 1\), \(p_3(x) = x^2 + 1\), \(p_4(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2\), and \(p_5(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\).

Evaluating each polynomial at \(x = 1\), we get:

The problem involves expressing \((\sin x)^7\) as a linear combination of \(\sin 7x\), \(\sin 5x\), \(\sin 3x\), and \(\sin x\). We need to find the coefficient \(d\) of \(\sin x\).

[ADVANCE]

To solve this, we can use the identity \(\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\) and express \((\sin x)^7\) in terms of complex exponentials. Then, we can use the binomial theorem to expand \((e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7\).

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing \(\sin x\) in terms of complex exponentials:
\[\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}.\]
Then,
\[(\sin x)^7 = \left(\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\right)^7 = \frac{1}{(2i)^7} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7.\]
Using the binomial theorem, we expand \((e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7\):
\[(e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \sum_{k=0}^7 \binom{7}{k} (e^{ix})^{7-k} (-e^{-ix})^k = \sum_{k=0}^7 \binom{7}{k} (-1)^k e^{i(7-2k)x}.\]
We are interested in the term that corresponds to \(\sin x\), which is the term where the exponent of \(e\) is \(ix\) or \(-ix\). This occurs when \(7-2k = 1\) or \(7-2k = -1\), i.e., when \(k = 3\) or \(k = 4\).

For \(k = 3\),
\[\binom{7}{3} (-1)^3 e^{ix} = -35 e^{ix}.\]
For \(k = 4\),
\[\binom{7}{4} (-1)^4 e^{-ix} = 35 e^{-ix}.\]
So, the coefficient of \(e^{ix} - e^{-ix}\) is \(-35 + 35 = -35 + 35 = 0\) for the \(e^{ix} - e^{-ix}\) terms other than the one corresponding to \(\sin x\), but we have to consider the term for \(\sin x\) which is
\[\frac{1}{-128i} (-35 e^{ix} + 35 e^{-ix}) = \frac{35}{128i} (e^{-ix} - e^{ix}) = \frac{35}{128i} (-2i \sin x) = \frac{35}{64} \sin x.\]
Thus, the coefficient \(d\) of \(\sin x\) is \(\frac{35}{64}\).

We start with the given equation:

\]
We can rearrange the equation to isolate \(\tan x^\circ\):
\[
\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ - \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ.
\]
Factoring out \(\tan x^\circ\) on the left side, we get:
\[
\tan x^\circ (\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ - 1) = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ.
\]
Solving for \(\tan x^\circ\), we have:
\[
\tan x^\circ = \frac{\tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ}{\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ - 1}.
\]
We recognize that the expression on the right-hand side resembles the formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles:
\[
\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
\]
By comparing, we can see that:
\[
\tan x^\circ = -\tan (53^\circ + 81^\circ) = -\tan 134^\circ.
\]
Since the tangent function is periodic with period \(180^\circ\) and is an odd function, we can rewrite \(-\tan 134^\circ\) as:
\[
\tan x^\circ = \tan (180^\circ - 134^\circ) = \tan 46^\circ.

Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we can express 1 as \( z^5 \) in the given expression. We also know that \( z \neq 1 \), so \( z \) is a fifth root of unity other than 1. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that \( z^5 = 1 \) to simplify the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

We recognize that \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \) is part of the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). By rearranging the terms, we can express the desired sum as:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = (z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) - 1. \]
Since \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we have:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = 0 - 1 = -1. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To convert the binary number $10101001110_{2}$ to base eight, we first need to convert it to base ten (decimal), and then convert the decimal number to base eight.

[ADVANCE]

First, we convert the binary number $10101001110_{2}$ to decimal. We do this by calculating the sum of the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of the 1's in the binary number.

\[

\]

Calculating each term:

\[
1 \cdot 2^{10} = 1024, \quad 0 \cdot 2^9 = 0, \quad 1 \cdot 2^8 = 256, \quad 0 \cdot 2^7 = 0, \quad 1 \cdot 2^6 = 64, \quad 0 \cdot 2^5 = 0, \quad 0 \cdot 2^4 = 0, \quad 1 \cdot 2^3 = 8, \quad 1 \cdot 2^2 = 4, \quad 1 \cdot 2^1 = 2, \quad 0 \cdot 2^0 = 0
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
1024 + 256 + 64 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 1358
\]

So, the decimal equivalent of the binary number $10101001110_{2}$ is $1358_{10}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we need to convert the decimal number $1358_{10}$ to base eight. We do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 8 and keeping track of the remainders.

\[
1358 \div 8 = 169 \text{ remainder } 6

\[
169 \div 8 = 21 \text{ remainder } 1

\[
21 \div 8 = 2 \text{ remainder } 5

The problem requires simplifying the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need to find a common denominator to combine the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

The problem involves throwing two fair, 6-sided dice and finding the probability that the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5. To solve this, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes where the product is a multiple of 5.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Total number of possible outcomes**: Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are thrown is $6 \times 6 = 36$.
2. **Favorable outcomes**: For the product of the two numbers to be a multiple of 5, at least one of the dice must show a 5. We can count the number of favorable outcomes by considering the complementary event (i.e., neither die shows a 5) and subtracting it from the total number of outcomes.
3. **Complementary event**: The number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5 is $5 \times 5 = 25$ (since each die has 5 faces that are not 5).
4. **Favorable outcomes calculation**: The number of favorable outcomes is the total number of outcomes minus the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5, which is $36 - 25 = 11$.

The problem asks for the domain of the function $\log x^2$ and requires us to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that the domain is $x < a$ or $x > b$, and then calculate $a + b$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the domain of the function $\log x^2$, we need to determine the values of $x$ for which the expression inside the logarithm is positive. The expression inside the logarithm is $x^2$, which is positive for all $x \neq 0$. Therefore, the domain of the function $\log x^2$ is all real numbers except $x = 0$.

Given that the domain is $x < a$ or $x > b$, we can infer that $a$ and $b$ are the points where the expression inside the logarithm is not defined or is zero. In this case, the only point where $x^2$ is zero is $x = 0$. To satisfy the form of the domain given in the problem, we can let $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, but since $x$ cannot be equal to 0, we need to consider the intervals separately. The correct interpretation is that the domain is split at $x = 0$, so we can let $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, but the intervals are $x < 0$ and $x > 0$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, we can calculate $a + b$.

We know that \(4\) can be expressed as a power of \(2\), specifically \(4 = 2^2\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation \(2^8=4^x\) as \(2^8=(2^2)^x\).

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the right side of the equation to \(2^{2x}\). Now the equation becomes \(2^8=2^{2x}\).

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: \(8 = 2x\).

The problem involves finding real numbers \(a \neq 0\) and \(b\) such that the given equation holds for the function \(f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1\). We need to express \(f(x) - f(a)\) in the form \((x - a)^2 (x - b)\) and identify the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we calculate \(f(x) - f(a)\):
\[f(x) - f(a) = (x^3 + 3x^2 + 1) - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 1) = x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2.\]

We can factor \(x^3 - a^3\) using the difference of cubes formula:
\[x^3 - a^3 = (x - a)(x^2 + ax + a^2).\]

So, we rewrite \(f(x) - f(a)\) as:
\[f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)(x^2 + ax + a^2) + 3x^2 - 3a^2.\]

We can further factor \(3x^2 - 3a^2\) using the difference of squares formula:
\[3x^2 - 3a^2 = 3(x^2 - a^2) = 3(x - a)(x + a).\]

Thus, we have:
\[f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)(x^2 + ax + a^2) + 3(x - a)(x + a) = (x - a)(x^2 + ax + a^2 + 3x + 3a) = (x - a)(x^2 + (a + 3)x + (a^2 + 3a)).\]

We are given that \(f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b)\). By comparing the two expressions, we can see that:
\[(x - a)(x^2 + (a + 3)x + (a^2 + 3a)) = (x - a)^2 (x - b) = (x - a)(x - a)(x - b) = (x - a)(x^2 - (a + b)x + ab).\]

By equating the coefficients of the quadratic terms, we get:
\[x^2 + (a + 3)x + (a^2 + 3a) = x^2 - (a + b)x + ab.\]

This gives us two equations by comparing the coefficients:
\[a + 3 = -(a + b),\]
\[a^2 + 3a = ab.\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(b\):
\[a + 3 = -a - b \implies 2a + 3 = -b \implies b = -2a - 3.\]

From the second equation, we can substitute \(b = -2a - 3\):
\[a^2 + 3a = a(-2a - 3) \implies a^2 + 3a = -2a^2 - 3a \implies 3a^2 + 6a = 0 \implies 3a(a + 2) = 0.\]

Since \(a \neq 0\), we have:
\[a + 2 = 0 \implies a = -2.\]

Now, we substitute \(a = -2\) into the equation for \(b\):
\[b = -2(-2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1.\]

Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((-2, 1)\).

The problem requires finding the number of integer values of $k$ in the closed interval $[-500,500]$ for which the equation $\log(kx)=2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution. We need to analyze the equation, identify the conditions for a single real solution, and then count the valid integer values of $k$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The given equation is $\log(kx)=2\log(x+2)$. Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as $\log(kx)=\log((x+2)^2)$. This implies that $kx = (x+2)^2$, since the logarithm function is one-to-one.

Expanding the equation, we get $kx = x^2 + 4x + 4$, which can be rearranged into a quadratic equation: $x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0$.

For the equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero. The discriminant $\Delta$ of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = 4-k$, and $c = 4$, so the discriminant is $\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16$.

Setting the discriminant to zero, we get $(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0$, which simplifies to $(4-k)^2 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $4-k = \pm 4$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 8$.

However, we need to check the validity of these values of $k$ in the context of the original equation. If $k = 0$, the equation $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$ becomes $\log(0) = 2\log(x+2)$, which is undefined because $\log(0)$ is undefined. Therefore, $k = 0$ is not a valid solution.

If $k = 8$, the equation becomes $\log(8x) = 2\log(x+2)$, which has a solution. We also need to ensure that the solution satisfies the domain of the logarithmic functions, i.e., $x > 0$ and $x+2 > 0$, which implies $x > 0$.

Next, we need to verify if there are any other possible values of $k$ that we might have missed. We also need to check the interval $[-500,500]$ for any other potential values of $k$.

We have already found that $k = 8$ is a valid solution. Now, we need to check if there are any other values of $k$ in the interval $[-500,500]$ that satisfy the condition of having exactly one real solution.

We can also consider the case where the quadratic equation $x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0$ has a repeated root, which means the discriminant is zero. We have already solved for $k$ and found $k = 0$ or $k = 8$. Since $k = 0$ is not valid, we only consider $k = 8$.

Additionally, we need to check the boundary conditions and ensure that the solution to the quadratic equation satisfies the domain of the logarithmic functions.

Since the quadratic equation has a repeated root, the solution is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4-k}{2}$. For $k = 8$, the solution is $x = -\frac{4-8}{2} = 2$, which is positive and satisfies the domain of the logarithmic functions.

Now, we need to count the number of integer values of $k$ in the interval $[-500,500]$ that satisfy the condition. We have found that only $k = 8$ is a valid solution.

The first equation is: $10T = 3S + G$.

Simplify the equation: $10T = 4S - 2T$.

Combine like terms: $12T = 4S$.

Divide both sides by 4: $3T = S$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's rewrite the equation as $(3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x$. This suggests a possible substitution to simplify the equation. Let $a = 3^x$ and $b = 10^x$. Then the equation becomes $a^2 + 19 = b$.

However, since $b = 10^x$ and $a = 3^x$, we can also express $b$ in terms of $a$ using the relationship between the bases 3 and 10. Unfortunately, there isn't a simple direct relationship, so we'll have to consider other methods.

We can try to find a solution by inspection or by testing some possible values of $x$. Let's test $x = 2$:
\[3^{2 \cdot 2} + 19 = 10^2 \implies 3^4 + 19 = 100 \implies 81 + 19 = 100 \implies 100 = 100.\]
So, $x = 2$ satisfies the equation.

To verify that there are no other solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the functions $3^{2x} + 19$ and $10^x$. The function $3^{2x} + 19$ grows slower than $10^x$ for large values of $x$, and for negative values of $x$, $3^{2x} + 19 > 10^x$ because the constant term 19 dominates.

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the rate at which the water level is rising is 4 meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

To ensure that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function for both $x \geq a$ and $x < a$. For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$, and for $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$.

We need to find the range of each part of the piecewise function. For $x \geq a$, the function $f(x) = ax^2$ is a quadratic function that opens upwards (assuming $a > 0$), so the minimum value of $f(x)$ for $x \geq a$ occurs at $x = a$, which is $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$.

For $x < a$, the function $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is a linear function, and its value at $x = a$ is $f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. As $x$ approaches negative infinity, the value of $f(x)$ also approaches negative infinity.

To ensure that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of the quadratic part $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ must overlap with the range of the linear part $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$. This means that the minimum value of the quadratic part, $a^3$, must be less than or equal to the value of the linear part at $x = a$, which is $a^2 + 2a$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$ to find the largest value of $a$. Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out $a$, we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The roots of the equation are $a = 0$, $a = 2$, and $a = -1$. We can use these roots to define the intervals to test the inequality.

Testing the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$, we find that the inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds true for $a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)$. However, since we are looking for the largest value of $a$ and considering the context of the problem (where $a$ is a coefficient that determines the shape of the function), we take the largest value from the interval $[0, 2]$.

Therefore, the largest value of $a$ is $\boxed{2}$.

\nThe problem requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of three numbers: $3339$, $2961$, and $1491$. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers and then find the GCD of the result with the third number.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nWe will start by finding the GCD of $3339$ and $2961$ using the Euclidean algorithm.

\nFirst, we divide $3339$ by $2961$ and find the remainder:
\[3339 = 2961 \cdot 1 + 378.\]
\nNext, we divide $2961$ by $378$ and find the remainder:
\[2961 = 378 \cdot 7 + 369.\]
\nThen, we divide $378$ by $369$ and find the remainder:
\[378 = 369 \cdot 1 + 9.\]
\nNext, we divide $369$ by $9$ and find the remainder:
\[369 = 9 \cdot 40 + 9.\]
\nFinally, we divide $9$ by $9$ and find the remainder:
\[9 = 9 \cdot 1 + 0.\]
\nSince the remainder is now $0$, the GCD of $3339$ and $2961$ is $9$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nNow, we need to find the GCD of $9$ and $1491$ using the Euclidean algorithm.

\nWe divide $1491$ by $9$ and find the remainder:

\nNext, we divide $9$ by $6$ and find the remainder:
\[9 = 6 \cdot 1 + 3.\]
\nThen, we divide $6$ by $3$ and find the remainder:
\[6 = 3 \cdot 2 + 0.\]
\nSince the remainder is now $0$, the GCD of $9$ and $1491$ is $3$.

The problem asks for the smallest possible integer value for \(x\) such that \(f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}\) has a real number value. This means we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative and the denominator is non-zero.

[ADVANCE]

1. The expression inside the square root, \(x-1\), must be non-negative for the square root to yield a real number. Therefore, we have \(x-1 \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(x \geq 1\).
2. The denominator, \(x-2\), must be non-zero to avoid division by zero. Therefore, we have \(x-2 \neq 0\), which simplifies to \(x \neq 2\).

Combining these conditions, we need \(x \geq 1\) and \(x \neq 2\). The smallest integer that satisfies these conditions is \(x = 3\).

[VERIFY]

We have considered the conditions for the expression inside the square root to be non-negative and the denominator to be non-zero. We have also identified the smallest integer that satisfies these conditions as \(x = 3\). This value ensures that \(f(x)\) has a real number value.

The problem involves finding the probability of exactly 4 out of 7 islands having treasure, with each island having a $\frac{1}{5}$ chance of having treasure. This is a classic binomial probability problem.

[ADVANCE]

The probability of exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p$, is given by the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]
where $\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

In this problem, $n = 7$ (the number of islands), $k = 4$ (the number of islands with treasure), and $p = \frac{1}{5}$ (the probability of an island having treasure).

[ADVANCE]

We can now plug in the values into the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right)^{7-4} \]
\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 \]
\[ P(X = 4) = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 \]
\[ P(X = 4) = \frac{7!}{4!3!} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 \]
\[ P(X = 4) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{4! \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 \]
\[ P(X = 4) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 \]

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given circle equation represents a circle with a radius of length 1. The equation of the circle is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]
To find the value of \( c \), we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

For the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).
For the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we can set \( 34 - c = 1 \) and solve for \( c \).

[ADVANCE]
Now, we solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

So, the value of \( c \) is \( \boxed{33} \).

The problem involves determining the final direction of a figure skater after spinning a certain number of degrees to the right from her initial facing direction, which is north.

[ADVANCE]
To solve this, we need to understand that a full spin is 360 degrees. We can reduce the total degrees spun by finding the remainder when 2250 is divided by 360, since spinning multiple full 360-degree circles doesn't change the direction.

Let's calculate the equivalent degrees within one full circle:

We are given the vector $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and we need to find the vector $\mathbf{v}$ such that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2$ and $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$ We need to use the properties of the dot product and cross product to find $\mathbf{v}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$. The given conditions are:
1. $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2$, which translates to $x + y + z = 2$.
2. $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

The cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v}$ can be computed as:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Equating this to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we get the system of equations:
\[
z - y = 1,
\]
\[
x - z = -2,
\]
\[
y - x = 1.
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve the system of equations step by step. From the third equation, we have $y = x + 1$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $z - (x + 1) = 1$, which simplifies to $z - x = 2$. From the second equation, we have $x - z = -2$, which is equivalent to $z - x = 2$. This is consistent with the previous equation.

Now we have two equations: $y = x + 1$ and $z = x + 2$. Substituting these into the equation $x + y + z = 2$, we get:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 2,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
3x + 3 = 2,
\]
\[
3x = -1,
\]
\[
x = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]
Then, $y = x + 1 = -\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3}$ and $z = x + 2 = -\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3}$.

Therefore, the vector $\mathbf{v}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{2}{3} \\ \frac{5}{3} \end{pmatrix}$.

The problem involves finding the sum of the reciprocals of the products of complex conjugate roots of the given polynomial equation. The equation is \(x^{10} + (13x-1)^{10} = 0\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The given equation can be rewritten as \(x^{10} = -(13x-1)^{10}\). Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get \(x = \omega(13x-1)\), where \(\omega = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\). This gives us 10 complex roots.

Rearranging the equation, we have \(x = \omega(13x-1) \implies x = 13\omega x - \omega \implies x(1 - 13\omega) = -\omega \implies x = \frac{\omega}{13\omega - 1}\).

The product of a complex root and its conjugate is given by \(r_i \overline{r}_i = \left(\frac{\omega}{13\omega - 1}\right) \left(\frac{\overline{\omega}}{13\overline{\omega} - 1}\right) = \frac{\omega \overline{\omega}}{(13\omega - 1)(13\overline{\omega} - 1)} = \frac{1}{169\omega \overline{\omega} - 13\omega - 13\overline{\omega} + 1} = \frac{1}{169 - 13(\omega + \overline{\omega}) + 1} = \frac{1}{170 - 13(\omega + \overline{\omega})}\).

Since \(\omega = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}\), we have \(\omega + \overline{\omega} = 2\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right)\).

The sum we need to find is \(\sum_{k=0}^4 \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r}_k} = \sum_{k=0}^4 \frac{170 - 13(\omega + \overline{\omega})}{1} = \sum_{k=0}^4 (170 - 26\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right))\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The sum can be simplified as follows:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^4 (170 - 26\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right)) = \sum_{k=0}^4 170 - 26 \sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right) = 850 - 26 \sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right).
\]
The sum of cosines of the angles that are symmetric about \(\pi/2\) is zero. The angles \(\frac{\pi}{10}, \frac{3\pi}{10}, \frac{5\pi}{10}, \frac{7\pi}{10}, \frac{9\pi}{10}\) are symmetric about \(\pi/2\), so their cosines sum to zero.

Therefore, \(\sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{10}\right) = 0\).

So, the sum simplifies to \(850 - 26 \cdot 0 = 850\).

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x.$ The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$, where $0 \le \lambda \le 4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition, we need to compute $f(f(x))$ and set it equal to $x$. First, let's calculate $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We want $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set the expression equal to $x$:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation should have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify the equation, let's denote $y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$. Then, the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ becomes $f(y) = x$, which means $\lambda y(1 - y) = x$. Substituting back $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$, we get:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This is a complex equation, so let's consider the fixed points of the function $f(x)$, i.e., the points where $f(x) = x$. These points satisfy:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$. The solution $x = 0$ is a fixed point, so we are interested in the solution $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$, which must be in the interval $[0,1]$ and satisfy $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which the solution $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ satisfies $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$. First, let's check the condition $0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1$:
\[0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.\]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.\]
The first part gives:
\[0 \le \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda \ge 1.\]
The second part gives:
\[\lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies -1 \le 0,\]
which is always true. Therefore, the condition $0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1$ simplifies to $\lambda \ge 1$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. We substitute $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ and check the condition $f(x) \neq x$. However, we can also use the fact that if $x$ is a solution to $f(f(x)) = x$ but not a fixed point of $f$, then the other solution to the quadratic equation $f(x) = x$ must be used.

Let's solve the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ by substituting $y = f(x)$:
\[\lambda y(1 - y) = x \quad \text{and} \quad y = \lambda x(1 - x).\]
Substituting $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$ into the first equation, we get a complex equation. Instead, we can use the fact that the function $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, and the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ is a quartic equation. We can use the properties of the quadratic function to find the values of $\lambda$.

The function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ has a maximum value at $x = \frac{1}{2}$, which is $\frac{\lambda}{4}$. For the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$, the value of $\lambda$ must be such that the function $f(x)$ has a non-fixed point solution.

By analyzing the function and the equation, we can conclude that the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition are $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$.

The problem involves finding the intersection points of two given curves and then calculating the sum of the distances from these points to a specific point $(-3,2)$. The first step is to rewrite the given equations of the curves in standard form to understand their properties better.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first equation is $x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0$. We can rewrite this equation by completing the square:
\[
x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 24y + 72 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 - 9 + (y-12)^2 - 144 + 72 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 81.
\]
This is a circle with center $(-3, 12)$ and radius 9.

The second equation is $x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0$. We can rewrite this equation as:
\[
x^2 + 6x - y^2 + 16y - 46 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 - 9 - (y-8)^2 + 64 - 46 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 - (y-8)^2 = -9.
\]
This is a hyperbola centered at $(-3, 8)$.

Next, we need to find the intersection points of the circle and the hyperbola. Since the circle has its center at $(-3, 12)$ and the hyperbola is centered at $(-3, 8)$, and considering the symmetry and the fact that the point $(-3, 2)$ is directly below the center of the circle, we can infer that the intersection points will be symmetric with respect to the line $x = -3$.

Let's solve the system of equations to find the intersection points. We can substitute $(x+3)^2 = 81 - (y-12)^2$ from the circle equation into the hyperbola equation:
\[
81 - (y-12)^2 - (y-8)^2 = -9 \implies 90 = (y-12)^2 + (y-8)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[
90 = y^2 - 24y + 144 + y^2 - 16y + 64 \implies 90 = 2y^2 - 40y + 208 \implies 2y^2 - 40y + 118 = 0 \implies y^2 - 20y + 59 = 0.
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation for $y$:
\[
y = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 236}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{164}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm 2\sqrt{41}}{2} = 10 \pm \sqrt{41}.
\]
So, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $10 + \sqrt{41}$ and $10 - \sqrt{41}$. Since the intersection points are symmetric with respect to the line $x = -3$, the $x$-coordinates can be found by substituting these $y$-values into the circle equation.

Next, we need to calculate the distances from these intersection points to the point $(-3, 2)$. The distance formula is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Given the symmetry and the fact that the $x$-coordinate of the intersection points is $-3$, the distance from each intersection point to $(-3, 2)$ will be the same for each pair of points with the same $y$-coordinate but opposite deviations in $x$-coordinate due to the circle's radius.

The distance from each intersection point to $(-3, 2)$ is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2} = \sqrt{81 - (y-12)^2 + (y-2)^2}.
\]
Substituting $y = 10 \pm \sqrt{41}$:
\[
\sqrt{81 - (10 \pm \sqrt{41} - 12)^2 + (10 \pm \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{81 - (-2 \pm \sqrt{41})^2 + (8 \pm \sqrt{41})^2}.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
\sqrt{81 - (4 \mp 4\sqrt{41} + 41) + (64 \pm 16\sqrt{41} + 41)} = \sqrt{81 - 45 \mp 4\sqrt{41} + 105 \pm 16\sqrt{41}} = \sqrt{141 \pm 12\sqrt{41}}.
\]
However, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances from the intersection points to $(-3, 2)$ is simply the sum of the distances from the points on the circle to the point directly above or below its center, which is the radius of the circle times 2 (since there are two pairs of symmetric points):
\[
2 \times 9 + 2 \times 9 = 36.

By comparing the two sets, we can see that the prime numbers less than 30 that are also odd numbers greater than zero are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. We can exclude 2 from the intersection because it is the only even prime number.

Next, we count the number of elements in the intersection. The elements in the intersection are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. There are 9 elements in the intersection.

# The problem involves an ellipse with the equation $kx^2 + y^2 = 1$, where $k > 1$ is a constant.
# We need to find the value of $k$ given that there is a circle passing through the foci $F_1$ and $F_2$ of the ellipse and tangent to the ellipse at two points on the $x$-axis.
# The foci of the ellipse are located on the $x$-axis, so we can find their coordinates by rewriting the ellipse equation in standard form.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

# The standard form of the ellipse equation is $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a^2 = \frac{1}{k}$ and $b^2 = 1$. Since $k > 1$, we have $a^2 < 1$, so $a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$ and $b = 1$.
# The distance from the center to each focus is given by $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{1-k}{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{a}$.
# The coordinates of the foci are $F_1 = \left(-\frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k}}, 0\right)$ and $F_2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k}}, 0\right)$.
# The circle passes through the foci and is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the $x$-axis, so the points of tangency must be the vertices of the ellipse on the $x$-axis, which are $(\pm a, 0) = \left(\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}, 0\right)$.
# The center of the circle must be on the $x$-axis, and since it is equidistant from the foci, the center of the circle is at the origin $(0, 0)$.
# The radius of the circle is the distance from the origin to one of the foci, which is $c = \frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k}}$.
# The circle is also tangent to the ellipse at $\left(\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}, 0\right)$, so the radius of the circle is also equal to the distance from the origin to these points, which is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$.
# Equating the two expressions for the radius, we get $\frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$.

The problem involves finding the degree measure of the least positive angle $\theta$ for which a given expression involving trigonometric functions equals $\tan \theta$. We need to simplify the given expression and then find the corresponding angle $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The given expression is:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the expression. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.\]

Similarly, the denominator can be rewritten using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B).\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[\sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) - \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ + \sin 15^\circ = 0 + 0 = 0.\]
However, this simplification seems incorrect as it leads to a division by zero. Let's re-evaluate the expression by using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities.

We can use the product-to-sum identities:
\[\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)],\]
\[\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)],\]
\[\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A + B) + \sin (A - B)],\]
\[\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A + B) - \sin (A - B)].\]

Applying these identities to the given expression, we get:
\[\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],\]
\[\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ],\]
\[\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ],\]
\[\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ].\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ]}{\frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ]}.\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2} [2\cos 25^\circ + 2\cos 85^\circ]}{\frac{1}{2} [2\sin 25^\circ - 2\sin 85^\circ]} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.\]

Using the sum-to-product identities:
\[\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),\]
\[\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).\]

We can rewrite the numerator and denominator as:
\[\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ,\]
\[\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ.\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.\]

The problem involves a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers with specific properties for geometric and arithmetic subsequences. We need to find the value of $a_1$ given that $a_{13} = 2016$.

Let's denote the common ratio of the geometric subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ by $r_k$ and the common difference of the arithmetic subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ by $d_k$. We can express the terms of the sequence as follows:
\[a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k\]
\[a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \cdot r_k = a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2\]
\[a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + d_k\]
Since $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$, $a_{2k+3}$ is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[a_{2k+2} = \frac{a_{2k+1} + a_{2k+3}}{2}\]
Substituting the expressions for $a_{2k+1}$ and $a_{2k+2}$, we get:
\[a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + d_k = \frac{a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + a_{2k+3}}{2}\]
Rearranging terms, we find:
\[a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + d_k = \frac{a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + a_{2k+3}}{2}\]
\[2a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + 2d_k = a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + a_{2k+3}\]
\[a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + 2d_k = a_{2k+3}\]
Since $a_{2k+3}$ is part of the geometric subsequence $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$, $a_{2k+3}$, we can express it as:
\[a_{2k+3} = a_{2k+2} \cdot \frac{a_{2k+3}}{a_{2k+2}} = (a_{2k-1} \cdot r_k^2 + d_k) \cdot \frac{a_{2k+3}}{a_{2k+2}}\]
However, we need to find a consistent relationship between the terms. Let's consider the relationship between consecutive terms and try to find a pattern.

We can start by examining the first few terms of the sequence. Let's denote $a_1 = a$, $a_2 = ar$, $a_3 = ar^2$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric subsequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$. Since $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[a_3 - a_2 = a_4 - a_3\]
\[ar^2 - ar = a_4 - ar^2\]
\[a_4 = 2ar^2 - ar = ar(2r - 1)\]
Now, we can find $a_5$. Since $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$ is a geometric sequence, we have:
\[a_4 = a_3 \cdot r_2\]
\[ar(2r - 1) = ar^2 \cdot r_2\]
\[r_2 = \frac{2r - 1}{r}\]
\[a_5 = a_4 \cdot r_2 = ar(2r - 1) \cdot \frac{2r - 1}{r} = a(2r - 1)^2\]

\[a_3 = ar^2\]
\[a_4 = ar(2r - 1)\]
\[a_5 = a(2r - 1)^2\]
\[a_6 = a(2r - 1)^2 \cdot \frac{3 - 2r}{2r - 1} = a(2r - 1)(3 - 2r)\]
We can continue this process, but it's complex. Instead, let's use the given information that $a_{13} = 2016$ to find the value of $a$ and $r$. We can express $a_{13}$ in terms of $a$ and $r$ by finding the pattern.

After re-examining the sequence, we can find that the common ratio $r$ is 2. We can verify this by substituting $r = 2$ into the sequence and checking if it satisfies the given conditions. If $r = 2$, we can express the terms of the sequence as:
\[a_1 = a\]
\[a_2 = 2a\]
\[a_3 = 4a\]
\[a_4 = 6a\]

To find the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys out of 7, we use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose. For the boys, this is \( \binom{7}{3} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To simplify the expression $\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}}$, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $2-\sqrt{3}$.

\[
\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2-\sqrt{3}} = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3})}{(2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3})}

The denominator simplifies to:

\[
(2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1

The numerator expands to:

\[
(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}{1} = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}

First, we can use the difference of squares formula to simplify $26^2 - 24^2$. The difference of squares formula states that $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$. Applying this formula, we get:
\[26^2 - 24^2 = (26 - 24)(26 + 24) = 2 \cdot 50 = 100.\]

Next, we can use the difference of squares formula again to simplify $90^2 - 10^2$:

\[
\frac{C}{x-3}+\frac{D}{x+8}=\frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}
\]
for all real values of $x$ except $-8$ and $3$. The first step is to recognize that the denominator on the right-hand side can be factored as $(x-3)(x+8)$, which matches the denominators on the left-hand side.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the equation as:
\[
\frac{C}{x-3}+\frac{D}{x+8}=\frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}
\]
By combining the fractions on the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\frac{C(x+8) + D(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}
\]
Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:
\[
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
(C+D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23

For this equation to hold for all values of $x$, the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms on both sides must be equal. This gives us the following system of equations:
\[
C + D = 4

\[
8C - 3D = -23
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $C$ and $D$. First, we solve the first equation for $C$:
\[
C = 4 - D
\]
Substituting this expression for $C$ into the second equation, we get:
\[
8(4 - D) - 3D = -23
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
32 - 8D - 3D = -23
\]
\[
32 - 11D = -23
\]
Subtracting 32 from both sides, we get:
\[
-11D = -55
\]
Dividing both sides by -11, we find:
\[
D = 5

Now, substituting $D = 5$ back into the equation $C = 4 - D$, we get:
\[
C = 4 - 5 = -1

So, the values of $C$ and $D$ are $C = -1$ and $D = 5$.

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ELLIPSE, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is given by:

where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ELLIPSE, we have:
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of L, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of E, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequencies of I, P, and S are all 1

So, the number of distinct arrangements is:

The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers such that $|a + bi| \le 5.$ This is equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions to the inequality $a^2 + b^2 \le 25$, since $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to count the number of integer points $(a,b)$ that lie inside or on the circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. This means we need to consider all integer values of $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2 \le 25$.

We can break this down by considering the possible values of $a$ and the corresponding values of $b$ that satisfy the inequality.

[ADVANCE]

For $a = 0$, we have $b^2 \le 25$, so $b$ can be any integer from $-5$ to $5$, giving us 11 possible values for $b$.

For $a = \pm 1$, we have $1 + b^2 \le 25$, so $b^2 \le 24$, and $b$ can be any integer from $-4$ to $4$, giving us 9 possible values for $b$.

For $a = \pm 2$, we have $4 + b^2 \le 25$, so $b^2 \le 21$, and $b$ can be any integer from $-4$ to $4$, giving us 9 possible values for $b$.

For $a = \pm 3$, we have $9 + b^2 \le 25$, so $b^2 \le 16$, and $b$ can be any integer from $-4$ to $4$, giving us 9 possible values for $b$.

For $a = \pm 4$, we have $16 + b^2 \le 25$, so $b^2 \le 9$, and $b$ can be any integer from $-3$ to $3$, giving us 7 possible values for $b$.

For $a = \pm 5$, we have $25 + b^2 \le 25$, so $b^2 \le 0$, and $b$ can only be 0, giving us 1 possible value for $b$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we sum up the number of possible pairs $(a,b)$ for each value of $a$:

- For $a = 0$, there are 11 possible values for $b$.
- For $a = \pm 1$, there are 9 possible values for $b$, and since there are 2 values of $a$, we have $2 \times 9 = 18$ possible pairs.
- For $a = \pm 2$, there are 9 possible values for $b$, and since there are 2 values of $a$, we have $2 \times 9 = 18$ possible pairs.
- For $a = \pm 3$, there are 9 possible values for $b$, and since there are 2 values of $a$, we have $2 \times 9 = 18$ possible pairs.
- For $a = \pm 4$, there are 7 possible values for $b$, and since there are 2 values of $a$, we have $2 \times 7 = 14$ possible pairs.
- For $a = \pm 5$, there is 1 possible value for $b$, and since there are 2 values of $a$, we have $2 \times 1 = 2$ possible pairs.

The total number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ is $11 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 14 + 2 = 81$.

The problem involves adding parentheses to the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) to minimize its value. We need to consider different ways to group the terms using parentheses without changing the order of operations or the terms themselves.

[ADVANCE]

To minimize the value of the expression, we should aim to subtract the largest possible sum of terms. Let's explore different placements of parentheses to achieve this.

1. Placing parentheses around the first four terms: \((1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = (6 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13\).
2. Placing parentheses around the first five terms: \((1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = (6 - 4 + 5) + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13\).
3. Placing parentheses around the last four terms: \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 1 + 2 + 3 - 15 = 6 - 15 = -9\).
4. Placing parentheses around the middle six terms: \(1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6) = 1 + (6 - 4 + 5 + 6) = 1 + 13 = 14\).

From the above calculations, we can see that the minimum possible value of the expression is \(-9\).

The problem involves determining the nature (even, odd, or neither) of the function $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$, given that $f(x)$ is an odd function and $g(x)$ is an even function.

[ADVANCE]

1. Recall the definitions of even and odd functions:
   - A function $h(x)$ is even if $h(-x) = h(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $h$.
   - A function $h(x)$ is odd if $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $h$.

2. Given that $f(x)$ is an odd function, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$.
3. Given that $g(x)$ is an even function, we have $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$.

4. We need to determine the nature of the function $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$. To do this, we will substitute $-x$ for $x$ and simplify step by step.

[ADVANCE]

5. Start with the innermost function and work outward. Substitute $-x$ for $x$ in the expression $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$:
   \[
   f(f(g(f(g(f(-x))))))
   \]
6. Since $f(x)$ is odd, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Apply this to the expression:
   \[
   f(f(g(f(g(-f(x))))))
   \]
7. Since $g(x)$ is even, we have $g(-x) = g(x)$. Apply this to the expression:
   \[
   f(f(g(f(g(-f(x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))
   \]
8. We see that $f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$, which means the function $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$ is even.

([ADVANCE]

9. Since the function $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$ remains unchanged when $-x$ is substituted for $x$, we can conclude that the function is even.

The problem is a linear equation involving fractions. The objective is to solve for the variable $x$ in the equation $\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left-hand side. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. We can rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = 5.

Combining the fractions gives:
\[
\frac{5x}{6} = 5.

To isolate $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

The problem states that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. This means that the product of the number of sales and the cost of the television is a constant. We need to find the number of customers who would buy a television that costs $\$$2500, given that 15 customers buy a television that costs $\$$1500.

[ADVANCE]
Let's denote the number of sales by $N$ and the cost of the television by $C$. According to Daniel's theory, $N$ is inversely proportional to $C$, so we can write the equation:
\[ N = \frac{k}{C} \]
where $k$ is a constant. We can find the value of $k$ using the given information: 15 customers buy a television that costs $\$$1500. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 15 = \frac{k}{1500} \]
Solving for $k$, we get:
\[ k = 15 \times 1500 = 22500 \]
Now that we have the value of $k$, we can use it to find the number of customers who would buy a television that costs $\$$2500. Let's denote the number of customers by $N_2$ and the cost by $C_2 = 2500$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ N_2 = \frac{22500}{2500} \]

The critical points are $x = -5$ (where $x+5$ changes sign) and $x = 2$ (where $3x-6$ changes sign). We will consider three cases: $x < -5$, $-5 \leq x < 2$, and $x \geq 2$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

**Case 1: $x < -5$**

In this case, $x+5 < 0$ and $3x-6 < 0$, so the equation becomes $-(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0$. Simplifying, we get:
\[
-x-5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \implies 2x - 11 = 0 \implies 2x = 11 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Since $\frac{11}{2} \geq -5$, this solution does not lie in the interval $x < -5$, so it is not valid for this case.

**Case 2: $-5 \leq x < 2$**

In this case, $x+5 \geq 0$ and $3x-6 < 0$, so the equation becomes $(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0$. Simplifying, we get:
\[
x+5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \implies 4x - 1 = 0 \implies 4x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since $\frac{1}{4}$ lies in the interval $-5 \leq x < 2$, this solution is valid for this case.

**Case 3: $x \geq 2$**

In this case, $x+5 \geq 0$ and $3x-6 \geq 0$, so the equation becomes $(x+5) - (3x-6) = 0$. Simplifying, we get:
\[
x+5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \implies -2x + 11 = 0 \implies -2x = -11 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}

Since $\frac{11}{2} \geq 2$, this solution lies in the interval $x \geq 2$, so it is valid for this case.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's calculate $z_1 = F(z_0)$. Given $z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i$, we substitute this into the function $F(z)$:
\[
z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + i + i}{\frac{1}{137} + i - i} = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 274i.
\]
Next, we calculate $z_2 = F(z_1)$. Given $z_1 = 1 + 274i$, we substitute this into the function $F(z)$:
\[
z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{1 + 274i + i}{1 + 274i - i} = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i}.
\]
To simplify, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z_2 = \frac{(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 74725i^2}{1 - (273i)^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 74725}{1 + 74529} = \frac{74726 + 2i}{74530} = \frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i.
\]
However, instead of continuing with these calculations, let's look for a pattern by calculating a few more terms or analyzing the function $F(z)$.

Next, we calculate $z_3 = F(z_2)$. Given $z_2 = \frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i$, we substitute this into the function $F(z)$:
\[
z_3 = F(z_2) = \frac{\frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i + i}{\frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i - i} = \frac{\frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{37266}{37265}i}{\frac{37363}{37265} - \frac{37264}{37265}i} = \frac{37363 + 37266i}{37363 - 37264i}.
\]
Again, to simplify, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z_3 = \frac{(37363 + 37266i)(37363 + 37264i)}{(37363 - 37264i)(37363 + 37264i)} = \frac{37363^2 + 37363 \cdot 37264i + 37266 \cdot 37363i + 37266 \cdot 37264i^2}{37363^2 + 37264^2}.
\]
This calculation is becoming complex, so let's evaluate the function $F(z)$ in a different way. We can find the fixed points of the function $F(z)$ by solving $F(z) = z$:
\[
z = \frac{z+i}{z-i} \implies z(z-i) = z+i \implies z^2 - iz = z + i \implies z^2 - (i+1)z - i = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula $z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -(i+1)$, and $c = -i$, we get:
\[
z = \frac{i+1 \pm \sqrt{(i+1)^2 + 4i}}{2} = \frac{i+1 \pm \sqrt{i^2 + 2i + 1 + 4i}}{2} = \frac{i+1 \pm \sqrt{-1 + 6i + 1}}{2} = \frac{i+1 \pm \sqrt{6i}}{2}.
\]
The fixed points are complex and not easily可计算的. Instead, let's calculate a few more terms to see if there is a periodic pattern.

Next, we calculate $z_4 = F(z_3)$. However, we can also analyze the behavior of the function $F(z)$ and its iterations. Given the complexity of the direct calculations, we should check if the function $F(z)$ has a periodic nature.

We notice that:
\[
F(i) = \frac{i+i}{i-i} = \frac{2i}{0},
\]
which is undefined. However, we can check the behavior around $i$. Let's calculate $F(F(z))$:
\[
F(F(z)) = F\left(\frac{z+i}{z-i}\right) = \frac{\frac{z+i}{z-i} + i}{\frac{z+i}{z-i} - i} = \frac{\frac{z+i + i(z-i)}{z-i}}{\frac{z+i - i(z-i)}{z-i}} = \frac{z+i + iz - i^2}{z+i - iz + i^2} = \frac{z+i+iz+1}{z+i-iz-1} = \frac{z(1+i) + (1+i)}{z(1-i) + (i-1)} = \frac{(z+1)(1+i)}{(z-1)(1-i)}.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
F(F(z)) = \frac{(z+1)(1+i)}{(z-1)(1-i)} \cdot \frac{1+i}{1+i} = \frac{(z+1)(1+i)^2}{(z-1)(1-i^2)} = \frac{(z+1)(1+2i-1)}{(z-1)(1+1)} = \frac{(z+1)2i}{(z-1)2} = \frac{z+1}{z-1}i.
\]
Now, we calculate $F(F(F(z)))$:
\[
F(F(F(z))) = F\left(\frac{z+1}{z-1}i\right) = \frac{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i + i}{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i - i} = \frac{\frac{z+1+i(z-1)}{z-1}}{\frac{z+1-i(z-1)}{z-1}} = \frac{(z+1)i + i(z-1)}{(z+1)i - i(z-1)} = \frac{z(i+1) + i - iz + i}{z(i+1) - iz + i} = \frac{2i}{2i} = -z.
\]
We find that $F(F(F(z))) = -z$. This implies that $F(F(F(F(z)))) = -F(z)$, and $F(F(F(F(F(z))))) = z$. Therefore, the function $F(z)$ has a periodicity of 4.

Given that $z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i$, we can find $z_{2002}$ by using the periodicity:
\[
z_{2002} = z_{4 \cdot 500 + 2} = F(F(z_0)).
\]
We already calculated $F(z_0) = 1 + 274i$. Now, we calculate $F(F(z_0))$:
\[
F(F(z_0)) = F(1 + 274i) = \frac{1 + 274i + i}{1 + 274i - i} = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i}.
\]
Simplifying as before:
\[
z_2 = \frac{(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 74725i^2}{1 - (273i)^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 74725}{1 + 74529} = \frac{74726 + 2i}{74530} = \frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i.

Therefore, the value of $z_{2002}$ is $\boxed{\frac{37363}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i}$.

To find the area of triangle $ACD$, we first need to find the length of the altitude $CD$. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle $ABC$ and then use the area to find the length of $CD$.

The semi-perimeter $s$ of triangle $ABC$ is:
\[ s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{17 + 8 + 15}{2} = 20. \]

Using Heron's formula, the area $K$ of triangle $ABC$ is:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} = \sqrt{20(20-17)(20-8)(20-15)} = \sqrt{20 \cdot 3 \cdot 12 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{3600} = 60. \]

The area of triangle $ABC$ can also be expressed as:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot CD. \]
So, we can solve for $CD$:
\[ 60 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 17 \cdot CD \implies CD = \frac{120}{17}. \]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the length of $CD$, we can find the area of triangle $ACD$. The area of triangle $ACD$ is:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD. \]

However, we don't have the length of $AD$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ to find $AD$. Let $AD = x$, then $BD = 17 - x$. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $ACD$:
\[ AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 \implies 8^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{120}{17}\right)^2 \implies 64 = x^2 + \frac{14400}{289} \implies x^2 = 64 - \frac{14400}{289} = \frac{18496 - 14400}{289} = \frac{4096}{289} \implies x = \frac{64}{17}. \]

So, $AD = \frac{64}{17}$. Now we can find the area of triangle $ACD$:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{64}{17} \cdot \frac{120}{17} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{7680}{289} = \frac{3840}{289}. \]

Therefore, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\boxed{\frac{3840}{289}}$.

The problem requires finding an integer \( n \) that satisfies the congruence \( n \equiv -11213141 \pmod{18} \) within the range \( 0 \leq n < 18 \).

[ADVANCE]

To solve this, we need to find the remainder when \(-11213141\) is divided by 18. This can be done by calculating the remainder of the absolute value of the number when divided by 18 and then adjusting for the negative sign.

First, we calculate \( 11213141 \div 18 \) to find the remainder.

\[ 11213141 \div 18 = 622952 \text{ remainder } 5 \]

This means \( 11213141 \equiv 5 \pmod{18} \). Since we need the remainder for \(-11213141\), we use the property of modular arithmetic that states \( -a \equiv 18 - a \pmod{18} \).

So, \( -11213141 \equiv -5 \pmod{18} \). To find a positive equivalent, we calculate:

\[ -5 \equiv 18 - 5 \pmod{18} \]
\[ -5 \equiv 13 \pmod{18} \]

Therefore, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the given congruence is \( n = 13 \).

The problem involves evaluating a polynomial function $f(x)$ at specific values of $x$. We are given the function $f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5$ and the value of the function at $x = -3$, which is $f(-3) = 2$. We need to find the value of $f(3)$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we will substitute $x = -3$ into the function $f(x)$ to get an equation involving $a$ and $b$:
\[ f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 2. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 2, \]
which further simplifies to:
\[ 81a - 9b + 2 = 2. \]
By subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
\[ 81a - 9b = 0. \]
We can divide the entire equation by 9 to simplify:
\[ 9a - b = 0. \]
This implies:
\[ b = 9a. \]

Next, we will substitute $x = 3$ into the function $f(x)$ to find $f(3)$:
\[ f(3) = a(3)^4 - b(3)^2 + 3 + 5. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ f(3) = 81a - 9b + 8. \]
Since we know that $b = 9a$, we can substitute $b$ in the equation:
\[ f(3) = 81a - 9(9a) + 8. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ f(3) = 81a - 81a + 8. \]
The terms involving $a$ cancel out, leaving us with:
\[ f(3) = 8. \]

The value of $f(3)$ is $\boxed{8}$.

The problem involves finding the measure of the largest angle in a convex quadrilateral where the largest angle is twice the measure of the smallest angle, and the other two angles are right angles (90 degrees each).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the measure of the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. Since the largest angle is twice the measure of the smallest angle, the largest angle is \( 2x \) degrees. The other two angles are right angles, so they each measure 90 degrees.

The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the sum of the angles in this quadrilateral:
\[ x + 2x + 90 + 90 = 360 \]

[ADVANCE]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x + 180 = 360 \]

Subtract 180 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 180 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the smallest angle is 60 degrees. Since the largest angle is twice the smallest angle, the largest angle is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

The problem involves finding the equation of a hyperbola defined by the set of points $P$ such that $|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24$, where $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_2 = (-16,2)$. The equation of the hyperbola is given in the standard form $\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, and we need to find the values of $h$, $k$, $a$, and $b$ to compute $h + k + a + b$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The distance between the foci $F_1$ and $F_2$ is given by the distance formula:
\[
F_1F_2 = \sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{26^2} = 26.
\]
For a hyperbola, the difference between the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to $2a$. Here, we are given that $|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24$, so $2a = 24$, which implies $a = 12$.

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci. The coordinates of the midpoint are:
\[
\left( \frac{10 + (-16)}{2}, \frac{2 + 2}{2} \right) = (-3, 2).
\]
Thus, the center of the hyperbola is $(h, k) = (-3, 2)$.

The distance from the center to each focus is $c$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to either focus. Here, $c = \frac{F_1F_2}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13$.

For a hyperbola, the relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5.

The problem asks for the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$. To determine this, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in $42!$, we can use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For our problem, $n = 42$ and $p = 5$. We will calculate each term in the formula:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since the next terms in the series will be zero, we can stop here. The highest power of 5 in $42!$ is:
\[

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to derive a relationship between the sums of the sequence and its squares. The inequality states that for any sequence of real numbers $a_i$ and $b_i$,
\[\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \right).\]
If we set $b_i = 1$ for all $i$, we get
\[\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \right)^2 \leq n \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right).\]
Substituting the given values, we have
\[96^2 \leq n \cdot 144,\]
which simplifies to
\[9216 \leq 144n,\]
and further simplifies to
\[n \geq 64.\]

Next, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again to derive a relationship between the sums of the sequence, its squares, and its cubes. We can also use the fact that the sequence consists of positive real numbers to apply the Power Mean Inequality (PMI). The PMI states that for positive real numbers $a_i$,
\[\left( \frac{a_1^3 + a_2^3 + \cdots + a_n^3}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}.\]
Substituting the given values, we have
\[\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{96}{n}.\]
From the first part of the inequality, we get
\[\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2},\]
which simplifies to
\[216^{1/3} n^{-1/3} \geq 144^{1/2} n^{-1/2},\]
and further simplifies to
\[6 n^{-1/3} \geq 12 n^{-1/2},\]
which gives us
\[n^{1/6} \geq 2,\]
and thus
\[n \geq 64.\]
From the second part of the inequality, we get
\[\left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{96}{n},\]
which simplifies to
\[144^{1/2} n^{-1/2} \geq 96 n^{-1},\]
and further simplifies to
\[12 n^{-1/2} \geq 96 n^{-1},\]
which gives us
\[n^{1/2} \geq 8,\]
and thus
\[n \geq 64.\]
We also need to check if $n = 64$ is a valid solution. If $n = 64$, then the equalities in the Power Mean Inequality must hold, which implies that all $a_i$ are equal. Let $a_i = a$ for all $i$. Then we have
\[64a = 96 \implies a = \frac{96}{64} = \frac{3}{2},\]
\[64a^2 = 144 \implies a^2 = \frac{144}{64} = \frac{9}{4} \implies a = \frac{3}{2},\]
\[64a^3 = 216 \implies a^3 = \frac{216}{64} = \frac{27}{8} \implies a = \frac{3}{2}.\]
Since all the equations are consistent, $n = 64$ is a valid solution.

The problem involves two bags, each initially containing one ball of each of the colors blue, green, orange, red, and violet.

We need to find the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Initial State**: Each bag contains 5 balls of different colors.
2. **Alice's Action**: Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Now, Bob's bag contains 6 balls, and Alice's bag contains 4 balls.
3. **Bob's Action**: Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after Bob's action, both bags have the same composition of colors.

For the contents of the two bags to be the same after Bob's action, the ball that Bob puts into Alice's bag must be the same color as the ball that Alice initially put into Bob's bag. This is because Bob's bag will then have the same set of colors as Alice's bag, which is the goal.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the color of the ball that Alice picks as \( C \). After Alice's action, Bob's bag contains the original 5 balls plus the ball of color \( C \) that Alice added. So, Bob's bag now has 6 balls, one of which is color \( C \).

The probability that Bob picks the ball of color \( C \) from his bag of 6 balls is \( \frac{1}{6} \). This is the probability that the contents of the two bags will be the same after Bob's action, given that Alice picked the ball of color \( C \).

Since Alice's choice of the ball color \( C \) is random and each color is equally likely, we need to consider the probability of each possible color being the one that Alice picks. However, the probability of the contents being the same does not depend on which specific color \( C \) is, but only on the fact that Bob must pick the same color \( C \) that Alice picked.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that Bob picks the same color \( C \) that Alice picked is \( \frac{1}{6} \), regardless of which color \( C \) is. Since Alice's choice of color \( C \) is independent of Bob's action, the overall probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after the process is simply the probability that Bob picks the same color ball that Alice picked, which is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Therefore, the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{6}} \).

To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use a trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Using the substitution, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

We recognize that \( \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta \) is the sine addition formula, which simplifies to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

We have found that the maximum value of \( f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). We need to verify that this corresponds to the maximum value of the original function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

When \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \) as a specific example. This gives us \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to simplify the gcd expression. The Euclidean algorithm states that for any integers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \mod b)$. Applying this to our problem, we have:
\[
\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7))

Simplifying the expression inside the gcd, we get:
\[
\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2n - 14) = \gcd(n + 7, -13)
\]
Since the gcd of a number and its negative is the same as the gcd of the number and the positive value, we can rewrite this as:
\[
\gcd(n + 7, -13) = \gcd(n + 7, 13)

The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Given $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can calculate the cross product:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The magnitude of the cross product is:
\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
The area of triangle $OAB$ is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

To find the point on the curve at \(t = 2\), we need to substitute \(t = 2\) into the parameterized equations for \(x\) and \(y\).

Calculate \(x\) at \(t = 2\):
\[x = 2^3 + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.\]

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for powers of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \implies z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2. \]
Since \( a^2 = a + 1 \), we have:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1. \]

We can continue this process to find higher powers:
\[ \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} \implies z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 - 2 = (a - 1)^2 - 2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 2 = a - 2a = -a + 1. \]

We observe a pattern and hypothesize that \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) can be expressed in terms of \( a \). Specifically, we can use the recurrence relation:
\[ z^{n+1} + \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \right) - \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right). \]

Using this relation, we can calculate a few more terms to identify a pattern:
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a(a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = a + 1 - 2a = -a + 1. \]
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a(-a + 1) - (a - 1) = -a^2 + a - a + 1 = -a^2 + 1 = -(a + 1) + 1 = -a. \]
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a(-a) - (-a + 1) = -a^2 + a - 1 = -(a + 1) + a - 1 = -2. \]
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a(-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]
\[ z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) - \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) = a(-a) - (-2) = -a^2 + 2 = -(a + 1) + 2 = -a + 1. \]
\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} \right) - \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) = a(-a + 1) - (-a) = -a^2 + a + a = -a^2 + 2a = -(a + 1) + 2a = a - 1. \]

We observe that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 12:
\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

The problem requires simplifying the expression $\frac{3}{\sqrt{27}}$. To simplify this, we need to rationalize the denominator by expressing $\sqrt{27}$ in its simplest radical form.

[ADVANCE]

First, we simplify the denominator $\sqrt{27}$. We know that $27 = 3^3$, so we can rewrite $\sqrt{27}$ as $\sqrt{3^3} = \sqrt{3^2 \cdot 3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.

Now, we substitute this simplified form back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{27}} = \frac{3}{3\sqrt{3}}
\]

Next, we can cancel out the common factor of 3 in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{3}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

We are given that $xyz = 2$ and we need to find the minimum value of $x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4$. To approach this problem, we can use the method of inequalities, specifically the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality.

[ADVANCE]

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression $x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4$. First, we can rewrite $4y^2$ as $2y^2 + 2y^2$ and $4z^4$ as $2z^4 + 2z^4$ to have more terms to apply AM-GM effectively.

Applying AM-GM to $x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4$, we get:
\[x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4 \geq 5 \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2z^4 \cdot 2z^4} = 5 \sqrt[5]{32 x^4 y^4 z^8}.\]

Since $xyz = 2$, we can substitute $z = \frac{2}{xy}$ into the expression:
\[x^4 y^4 z^8 = x^4 y^4 \left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^8 = x^4 y^4 \frac{256}{x^8 y^8} = \frac{256}{x^4 y^4}.\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \sqrt[5]{32 \cdot \frac{256}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \sqrt[5]{2^5 \cdot 2^8 \cdot \frac{1}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \sqrt[5]{2^{13} \cdot \frac{1}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \cdot 2^2 \sqrt[5]{\frac{2^3}{x^4 y^4}} = 20 \sqrt[5]{\frac{8}{x^4 y^4}}.\]

To minimize the expression, we need the term inside the fifth root to be 1, i.e., $\frac{8}{x^4 y^4} = 1$, which implies $x^4 y^4 = 8$ or $xy = \sqrt[4]{8} = \sqrt{2\sqrt{2}}$.

We also know that $xyz = 2$, so $z = \frac{2}{xy} = \frac{2}{\sqrt[4]{8}} = \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy these conditions. Let's assume $x = y = \sqrt[4]{2}$ and $z = \sqrt[4]{4}$, then we can verify if these values satisfy the condition $xyz = 2$:
\[\left(\sqrt[4]{2}\right) \left(\sqrt[4]{2}\right) \left(\sqrt[4]{4}\right) = \sqrt[4]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt[4]{2^3} = \sqrt[4]{8} \neq 2.\]

This indicates that our initial assumption might be incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate the expression. However, we can use the AM-GM inequality in a different way to find the minimum value.

Applying AM-GM to $x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4$ directly:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4 \geq 5 \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2z^4 \cdot 2z^4} = 5 \sqrt[5]{32 x^4 y^4 z^8}.\]

Since $xyz = 2$, we have $z = \frac{2}{xy}$, substituting this into the expression:
\[x^4 y^4 z^8 = x^4 y^4 \left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^8 = \frac{256}{x^4 y^4}.\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \sqrt[5]{32 \cdot \frac{256}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \sqrt[5]{2^5 \cdot 2^8 \cdot \frac{1}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \sqrt[5]{2^{13} \cdot \frac{1}{x^4 y^4}} = 5 \cdot 2^2 \sqrt[5]{\frac{2^3}{x^4 y^4}} = 20 \sqrt[5]{\frac{8}{x^4 y^4}}.\]

To minimize the expression, we need the term inside the fifth root to be 1, i.e., $\frac{8}{x^4 y^4} = 1$, which implies $x^4 y^4 = 8$ or $xy = \sqrt[4]{8} = \sqrt{2\sqrt{2}}$.

We can also use the method of Lagrange multipliers or further inequalities to find the minimum value. However, based on the symmetry and the condition $xyz = 2$, we can test the values that satisfy the equality condition of the AM-GM inequality.

Let's test $x = \sqrt{2}$, $y = 1$, and $z = \sqrt{2}$, then we have:
\[xyz = \sqrt{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2,\]
which satisfies the condition. Now, we can calculate the value of the expression:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 + 4(1)^2 + 4(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 + 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24.\]

To solve the equation, we can use cross-multiplication to eliminate the fractions. Cross-multiplying gives us:

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

We need to find Rosa's age, which we'll denote as $R$. The problem provides the following conditions:
1. When $R$ is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1.
2. When $R$ is divided by 7, the remainder is 0.
3. $R$ is less than 75.

We can translate these conditions into mathematical expressions:
1. $R \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$, $R \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, $R \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, and $R \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$.
2. $R \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.
3. $R < 75$.

Since the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12, the first set of congruences can be simplified to $R \equiv 1 \pmod{12}$.

[ADVANCE]

We now have two key congruences:
1. $R \equiv 1 \pmod{12}$.
2. $R \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.

This means $R$ is of the form $R = 12k + 1$ for some integer $k$, and $R$ is also a multiple of 7. We can substitute the form of $R$ from the first congruence into the second congruence:
\[12k + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}.\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[12k \equiv -1 \pmod{7}.\]
Since $12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, we can rewrite the congruence as:
\[5k \equiv -1 \pmod{7}.\]
To solve for $k$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 because $5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by 3, we get:
\[k \equiv -3 \pmod{7}.\]
Since $-3 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$, we have:
\[k \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.\]
This means $k = 7m + 4$ for some integer $m$. Substituting $k$ back into the expression for $R$, we get:
\[R = 12k + 1 = 12(7m + 4) + 1 = 84m + 48 + 1 = 84m + 49.\]
Since $R < 75$, we need to find the appropriate value of $m$:
\[84m + 49 < 75.\]
Solving for $m$, we get:
\[84m < 26,\]
\[m < \frac{26}{84},\]
\[m < \frac{13}{42}.\]
Since $m$ is an integer, the only possible value for $m$ is 0. Therefore, substituting $m = 0$ into the expression for $R$, we get:
\[R = 84 \cdot 0 + 49 = 49.\]

We start by evaluating the function for small values of $i$ and $j$ to understand the pattern. First, we calculate the base cases for $i=0$:
\[f(0,j) = \text{mod}_5 (j+1) \text{ for } 0 \le j \le 4.\]
So, we have:
\[f(0,0) = \text{mod}_5 (0+1) = 1,\]
\[f(0,1) = \text{mod}_5 (1+1) = 2,\]
\[f(0,2) = \text{mod}_5 (2+1) = 3,\]
\[f(0,3) = \text{mod}_5 (3+1) = 4,\]
\[f(0,4) = \text{mod}_5 (4+1) = 0.\]

Next, we calculate $f(1,j)$ using the recursive rule $f(i,j) = f(i-1, f(i,j-1))$ for $i \ge 1$ and $1 \le j \le 4$, and $f(i,0) = f(i-1,1)$ for $i \ge 1$ and $j = 0$:
\[f(1,0) = f(0,1) = 2,\]
\[f(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,2) = 3,\]
\[f(1,2) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,3) = 4,\]
\[f(1,3) = f(0, f(1,2)) = f(0,4) = 0,\]
\[f(1,4) = f(0, f(1,3)) = f(0,0) = 1.\]

We observe that the values of $f(1,j)$ are a permutation of the values of $f(0,j)$. We can continue this process to find $f(2,j)$:
\[f(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3,\]
\[f(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1,3) = 0,\]
\[f(2,2) = f(1, f(2,1)) = f(1,0) = 2,\]
\[f(2,3) = f(1, f(2,2)) = f(1,2) = 4,\]
\[f(2,4) = f(1, f(2,3)) = f(1,4) = 1.\]

We notice that the values of $f(2,j)$ are again a permutation of the values of $f(0,j)$. This suggests a periodic pattern in the function $f(i,j)$. We can hypothesize that the function $f(i,j)$ has a period of 4 with respect to $i$.

Next, we need to verify this hypothesis and find the value of $f(2015,2)$.

[ADVANCE]

Since we hypothesized that the function $f(i,j)$ has a period of 4 with respect to $i$, we can reduce the problem of finding $f(2015,2)$ to finding $f(3,2)$. This is because $2015 \mod 4 = 3$.

We already calculated the values of $f(2,j)$, so we can use the recursive rule to find $f(3,j)$:
\[f(3,0) = f(2,1) = 0,\]
\[f(3,1) = f(2, f(3,0)) = f(2,0) = 3,\]
\[f(3,2) = f(2, f(3,1)) = f(2,3) = 4,\]
\[f(3,3) = f(2, f(3,2)) = f(2,4) = 1,\]
\[f(3,4) = f(2, f(3,3)) = f(2,1) = 0.\]

The squared distances are:

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively. This means that $\triangle AMN$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$ by the AA similarity postulate, and the ratio of the corresponding sides of $\triangle AMN$ to $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, since $M$ and $N$ are $\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from $A$ to $B$ and $A$ to $C$, respectively.

Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side length, the area of $\triangle AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of $\triangle ABC$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle AMN$ is $\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64$.

Next, we need to find the area of $\triangle ENG$. Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides $\triangle AMN$ into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of $\triangle AMN$.

# Additionally, we can have smaller diagonals with only 2 points, but we need 3 points to form a line, so we cannot form a line with these smaller diagonals.
# Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes (sets of 3 collinear points) is $3 + 3 + 2 = 8$.

The problem involves finding the shortest path for a gecko to reach a fly in a 3D room. The gecko starts on one side wall, one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall, and the fly is on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. The gecko can walk across the ceiling and walls but cannot jump.

The room's dimensions are 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. The gecko's starting position is at (0, 1, 7) and the fly's position is at (12, 1, 1), where the coordinates are in the format (x, y, z).

To find the shortest path, we can unfold the room into a 2D plane and calculate the straight-line distance between the gecko's starting position and the fly's position.

[ADVANCE]
To unfold the room, we can imagine the gecko starting on the side wall at coordinates (0, 1, 7) and the fly on the opposite side wall at coordinates (12, 1, 1). We can unfold the room by creating a 2D representation where the gecko can walk across the ceiling and walls.

One way to unfold the room is to consider the gecko's path as a straight line on a 2D plane. We can create a rectangle where the length is the sum of the room's length and the width (since the gecko can walk across the ceiling), and the width is the room's height.

The coordinates of the gecko and the fly in this 2D representation would be (0, 7) and (12 + 10, 1) = (22, 1), respectively. The distance between these two points can be calculated using the distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(22 - 0)^2 + (1 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{22^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{484 + 36} = \sqrt{520} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 130} = 2\sqrt{130}

The problem involves selecting a point $(x,y)$ randomly from a rectangular region defined by $0 \le x \le 8$ and $0 \le y \le 4$. We need to find the probability that the point satisfies the inequality $x+y \le 4$.

[ADVANCE]

The total area of the rectangular region is $8 \times 4 = 32$. The inequality $x+y \le 4$ defines a triangular region within this rectangle. The vertices of this triangle are $(0,0)$, $(0,4)$, and $(4,0)$, since when $x=4$, $y=0$ and when $y=4$, $x=0$.

The area of this triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 4 = 8$.

The probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ satisfies $x+y \le 4$ is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle.

The problem involves two runners, $A$ and $B$, starting at point $O$ on a linear track and running in the same direction. Runner $B$ runs three times as fast as runner $A$. An observer stands at point $P$ such that $\overline{OP}$ is perpendicular to the track. We need to find the maximum value of $\angle APB$ in degrees.

Let's denote the speed of runner $A$ as $v$. Then, the speed of runner $B$ is $3v$. Let $t$ be the time in seconds after they start running. The distance covered by runner $A$ is $vt$, and the distance covered by runner $B$ is $3vt$.

We can place the points in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Let point $O$ be the origin $(0,0)$, point $P$ be $(0,1)$, point $A$ be $(vt,0)$, and point $B$ be $(3vt,0)$.

Next, we need to find the angle $\angle APB$. We can use the tangent function to find this angle. The slope of line $AP$ is $\frac{0-1}{vt-0} = -\frac{1}{vt}$, and the slope of line $BP$ is $\frac{0-1}{3vt-0} = -\frac{1}{3vt}$.

The tangent of angle $\angle APB$ can be found using the formula for the tangent of the difference of two angles:
\[
\tan \angle APB = \left| \frac{-\frac{1}{vt} - \left(-\frac{1}{3vt}\right)}{1 + \left(-\frac{1}{vt}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{3vt}\right)} \right| = \left| \frac{-\frac{1}{vt} + \frac{1}{3vt}}{1 + \frac{1}{3v^2t^2}} \right| = \left| \frac{-\frac{2}{3vt}}{1 + \frac{1}{3v^2t^2}} \right| = \left| \frac{-\frac{2}{3vt}}{\frac{3v^2t^2 + 1}{3v^2t^2}} \right| = \left| \frac{-2}{3vt} \cdot \frac{3v^2t^2}{3v^2t^2 + 1} \right| = \left| \frac{-2vt}{3v^2t^2 + 1} \right| = \frac{2vt}{3v^2t^2 + 1}.
\]

To find the maximum value of $\angle APB$, we need to maximize $\tan \angle APB$. Let $x = vt$. Then, we need to maximize the function $f(x) = \frac{2x}{3x^2 + 1}$.

Next, we find the critical points by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = \frac{(3x^2 + 1) \cdot 2 - 2x \cdot 6x}{(3x^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{6x^2 + 2 - 12x^2}{(3x^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{2 - 6x^2}{(3x^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get:
\[
\frac{2 - 6x^2}{(3x^2 + 1)^2} = 0 \implies 2 - 6x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{3} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

We can use the second derivative test to confirm that this critical point corresponds to a maximum. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is:
\[
f''(x) = \frac{(3x^2 + 1)^2 \cdot (-12x) - (2 - 6x^2) \cdot 2(3x^2 + 1) \cdot 6x}{(3x^2 + 1)^4} = \frac{-12x(3x^2 + 1)^2 - 12x(2 - 6x^2)(3x^2 + 1)}{(3x^2 + 1)^4}.
\]
Evaluating $f''(x)$ at $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, we get a negative value, confirming that $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ is a maximum.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ back into the expression for $\tan \angle APB$:
\[
\tan \angle APB = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{3 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}}{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 1} = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}}{1 + 1} = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The angle whose tangent is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ is $30^\circ$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $\angle APB$ is $\boxed{30}$ degrees.

The problem involves finding the sum of the roots of a given polynomial equation. The equation is $\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24$. The first step is to rewrite the equation in the standard polynomial form.

[ADVANCE]

To rewrite the equation in standard polynomial form, we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by $x$:
\[1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0.\]
This is a cubic equation in the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, where $a = 5$, $b = -6$, $c = 24$, and $d = 1$.

[ADVANCE]

According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic equation of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$. In this case, the sum of the roots $a + b + c$ is:

The problem asks for the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200. To solve this, we need to identify the first and last multiples of 7 within the given range, and then use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first multiple of 7 that is greater than or equal to 100 is 105, and the last multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to 200 is 196. We can verify this by dividing 100 and 200 by 7 and rounding to the nearest integers: \(100 \div 7 \approx 14.29\), so the first multiple is \(7 \times 15 = 105\), and \(200 \div 7 \approx 28.57\), so the last multiple is \(7 \times 28 = 196\).

Now, we need to find the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a = 105\), the last term \(l = 196\), and the common difference \(d = 7\). The number of terms \(n\) can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\). Setting \(a_n = 196\), we get:
\[196 = 105 + (n-1) \cdot 7\]
\[196 - 105 = (n-1) \cdot 7\]
\[91 = (n-1) \cdot 7\]
\[n-1 = \frac{91}{7}\]
\[n-1 = 13\]
\[n = 14\]

So, there are 14 terms in the sequence.

Next, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)\), where \(S_n\) is the sum, \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(l\) is the last term. Substituting the values, we get:
\[S_{14} = \frac{14}{2} (105 + 196)\]
\[S_{14} = 7 \cdot 301\]
\[S_{14} = 2107\]

Therefore, the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 is \(\boxed{2107}\).

[ADVANCE]
To rewrite the quadratic in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we need to complete the square. The given quadratic is $x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6$. We start by taking the coefficient of $x$, which is 2.6, dividing it by 2, and then squaring the result. This gives us $\left(\frac{2.6}{2}\right)^2 = 1.69$.

We can now rewrite the quadratic as:
\[x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 = (x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + (3.6 - 1.69) = (x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91.\]
By comparing this with the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we identify $b = 1.3$ and $c = 1.91$.

The problem involves finding the greatest possible value of an expression given the ranges of two variables, $a$ and $b$. The expression to maximize is $\left(a+\frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b}-a\right)$, and the variables $a$ and $b$ are constrained by the inequalities $-6\leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the given expression:
\[
\left(a+\frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b}-a\right) = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 + \frac{a}{b} - \frac{a}{b} = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2.
\]
So, the expression to maximize is $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$.

Next, we need to find the maximum value of $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$ given the constraints $-6\leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$.

Since $a^2$ is maximized when $a$ is at its most extreme value (i.e., $a = -6$ or $a = -2$), and $\frac{1}{b^2}$ is maximized when $b$ is at its smallest value (i.e., $b = 3$), we should evaluate the expression at these extreme values.

Let's calculate the value of the expression at the extreme values of $a$ and $b$:
1. When $a = -6$ and $b = 3$:
\[
\frac{1}{3^2} - (-6)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 36 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{324}{9} = -\frac{323}{9}.
\]
2. When $a = -6$ and $b = 5$:
\[
\frac{1}{5^2} - (-6)^2 = \frac{1}{25} - 36 = \frac{1}{25} - \frac{900}{25} = -\frac{899}{25}.
\]
3. When $a = -2$ and $b = 3$:
\[
\frac{1}{3^2} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}.
\]
4. When $a = -2$ and $b = 5$:
\[
\frac{1}{5^2} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{25} - 4 = \frac{1}{25} - \frac{100}{25} = -\frac{99}{25}.
\]

Next, we compare the values obtained:
\[
-\frac{323}{9} \approx -35.89, \quad -\frac{899}{25} = -35.96, \quad -\frac{35}{9} \approx -3.89, \quad -\frac{99}{25} = -3.96.
\]
The greatest value among these is $-\frac{35}{9}$.

The problem requires simplifying the expression $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ$. We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by expressing $\tan 100^\circ$ in terms of $\sin 100^\circ$ and $\cos 100^\circ$:
\[
\tan 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ
\]
We can combine the terms over a common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ \cos 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]
Using the double-angle identity $\sin 200^\circ = 2 \sin 100^\circ \cos 100^\circ$, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ + 2 \sin 200^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]
Since $\sin 200^\circ = \sin (180^\circ + 20^\circ) = -\sin 20^\circ$, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ - 2 \sin 20^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator. However, another approach is to use the known result that $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \sqrt{10} \sin (100^\circ + \arctan 4)$. But we can also simplify it using the angle addition formula.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the angle addition formula for sine to simplify the expression. We need to find a way to express the numerator in a simpler form. We can use the fact that $\sin 100^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 100^\circ) = -\cos (-10^\circ) = -\cos 10^\circ$ and $\cos 100^\circ = -\sin 10^\circ$. However, this approach seems complicated. Instead, we can use the known result or simplify it step by step.

Let's use the known result that $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \sqrt{10} \sin (100^\circ + \arctan 4)$. We can verify this result using trigonometric identities.

[ADVANCE]

We can verify the result by expressing $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ$ in terms of $\sin 100^\circ$ and $\cos 100^\circ$ and then simplifying it. However, the expression $\sqrt{10} \sin (100^\circ + \arctan 4)$ is a known result, and we can use it directly.

The value of $\arctan 4$ is an angle whose tangent is 4. We can use the fact that $\sin (100^\circ + \arctan 4) = \sin 100^\circ \cos (\arctan 4) + \cos 100^\circ \sin (\arctan 4)$. Since $\cos (\arctan 4) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{17}}$ and $\sin (\arctan 4) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}$, we can substitute these values into the expression.

However, we can directly use the known result that $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \sqrt{10} \sin (100^\circ + \arctan 4) = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}$.

To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. First, we need to calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle, which is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]
where \( a = 5 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 6 \). So,
\[ s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Now, we can use Heron's formula to find the area \( A \) of the triangle:
\[ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ A = \sqrt{8(8-5)(8-5)(8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12 \]

The problem involves finding the product of the $y$-coordinates of all distinct solutions $(x,y)$ for the two equations $y=x^2-8$ and $y^2=-5x+44$. We need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of $y$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we have $y = x^2 - 8$. Substituting this into the second equation $y^2 = -5x + 44$, we get:
\[
(x^2 - 8)^2 = -5x + 44
\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[
x^4 - 16x^2 + 64 = -5x + 44

Rearranging the terms, we get a polynomial equation in $x$:
\[
x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0
\]
This is a quartic equation in $x$. To find the corresponding $y$-coordinates, we can use the fact that $y = x^2 - 8$. However, solving this quartic equation directly for $x$ might be complex, so we should consider alternative approaches to find the product of the $y$-coordinates.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can use Vieta's formulas to find the product of the roots of the quartic equation. However, we need to find the product of the $y$-coordinates, not the $x$-coordinates. Since $y = x^2 - 8$, we can express $x^2$ as $y + 8$. Substituting $x^2 = y + 8$ into the equation $y^2 = -5x + 44$, we need to express $x$ in terms of $y$.

First, we need to find the values of $x$ in terms of $y$ from the equation $y = x^2 - 8$, which gives $x^2 = y + 8$. Then, we substitute $x^2 = y + 8$ into the equation $y^2 = -5x + 44$ to get an equation involving $y$ and $x$. However, this substitution directly might be complex, so we should consider the relationship between the equations.

We can also use the fact that the product of the roots of the polynomial equation can be related to the constant term and the leading coefficient. For the quartic equation $x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0$, the product of the roots (taken four at a time) is given by the constant term (20) divided by the leading coefficient (1), which is 20. However, we need the product of the $y$-coordinates.

We can use the relationship between the $x$ and $y$ variables to find the product of the $y$-coordinates. Since $y = x^2 - 8$, we can express the quartic equation in terms of $y$ by substituting $x^2 = y + 8$ into the equation $y^2 = -5x + 44$. However, this substitution might be complex, so we should consider the nature of the solutions.

We can find the product of the $y$-coordinates by considering the polynomial whose roots are the $y$-coordinates. From the equation $y^2 = -5x + 44$, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x = \frac{44 - y^2}{5}$. Substituting this into the equation $y = x^2 - 8$, we get:
\[
y = \left(\frac{44 - y^2}{5}\right)^2 - 8
\]
Expanding and rearranging, we get a polynomial equation in $y$:
\[
y = \frac{(44 - y^2)^2}{25} - 8
\]
Multiplying through by 25, we get:
\[
25y = (44 - y^2)^2 - 200
\]
Expanding the right side, we have:
\[
25y = 1936 - 88y^2 + y^4 - 200
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
y^4 - 88y^2 - 25y + 1736 = 0

This is a quartic equation in $y$. The product of the roots of this quartic equation is given by the constant term (1736) divided by the leading coefficient (1), which is 1736.

To add the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 3 is 15. We can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 15.

$\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{3}{15}$

We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to set up two equations based on the given information:
1. $a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200$
2. $a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500$

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a_1$ and solve for $d$:
$(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200$
$4d = 300$
$d = 75$

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$. We'll use the first equation:
$a_1 + 3d = 200$
$a_1 + 3(75) = 200$
$a_1 + 225 = 200$
$a_1 = -25$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The sum of the infinite geometric series is:
\[ S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4}{\frac{a-3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a-3} \]
We are given that the sum is a perfect square, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{4a}{a-3} = k^2 \]
where $k$ is an integer. Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ 4a = k^2(a-3) \]
\[ 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \]
\[ 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \]
\[ a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \]
\[ a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2 \]
\[ a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} \]
Since $a$ is a positive integer, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $a$ is a positive integer and $|r| < 1$, i.e., $\left|\frac{3}{a}\right| < 1$ or $a > 3$.

We will test small integer values of $k$ to find the smallest possible value of $a$.

For $k = 1$:

which is not a positive integer.

For $k = 2$:

For $k = 4$:
\[ a = \frac{3(4)^2}{(4)^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the $y$-intercepts, we set $x = 0$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $y$:
\[0 = y^2 - 4y - 1.\]
This is a quadratic equation in the form $ay^2 + by + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -1$. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula:
\[y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[y = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{5}.\]
So, the solutions to the equation are $y = 2 + \sqrt{5}$ and $y = 2 - \sqrt{5}$. These are the $y$-coordinates of the $y$-intercepts.

To find the smallest possible value of $\left| m - n \right|$, we need to express one variable in terms of the other using the given equation $3m + 4n = 100$. We can solve for $m$ in terms of $n$:

\[3m = 100 - 4n\]
\[m = \frac{100 - 4n}{3}\]

For $m$ to be an integer, $100 - 4n$ must be divisible by 3. We can check the divisibility by examining the remainder when 100 is divided by 3:

\[100 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\]
\[100 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\]
\[1 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\]
\[ -4n \equiv -1 \pmod{3}\]
\[2n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\]
\[n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\]

This means $n$ can be written as $n = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $n = 3k + 2$ into the equation for $m$:

\[m = \frac{100 - 4(3k + 2)}{3}\]
\[m = \frac{100 - 12k - 8}{3}\]
\[m = \frac{92 - 12k}{3}\]
\[m = 30 - 4k\]

Now we have $m = 30 - 4k$ and $n = 3k + 2$. We need to find the value of $k$ that minimizes $\left| m - n \right|$:

\[\left| m - n \right| = \left| (30 - 4k) - (3k + 2) \right|\]
\[\left| m - n \right| = \left| 30 - 7k - 2 \right|\]
\[\left| m - n \right| = \left| 28 - 7k \right|\]
\[\left| m - n \right| = 7 \left| 4 - k \right|\]

The expression $7 \left| 4 - k \right|$ is minimized when $\left| 4 - k \right| = 0$, i.e., when $k = 4$. Substituting $k = 4$ into the expressions for $m$ and $n$:

\[m = 30 - 4(4) = 30 - 16 = 14\]
\[n = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\]

When $k = 4$, we have $m = 14$ and $n = 14$, so $\left| m - n \right| = \left| 14 - 14 \right| = 0$.

Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\left| m - n \right|$ is $\boxed{0}$.

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ to a terminating decimal. To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2^a \cdot 5^b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5^5 = 10^2 \cdot 5^5$. To make the denominator a power of 10, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to get $10^7$ in the denominator.

So, we have:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{10^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can express the fraction $\frac{672}{10^7}$ as a decimal by moving the decimal point in 672 seven places to the left, since the denominator is $10^7$.

\[
\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672

First, we simplify the innermost expression $\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}$. Since $729 = 3^6$, we have:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3^6}} = \frac{1}{3^3} = \frac{1}{27}

Next, we need to find the cube root of $\frac{1}{27}$. Since $27 = 3^3$, we have:

Finally, we need to find the square root of $\frac{1}{3}$. We have:

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

Let's denote the total number of students at Baker Middle School as \( x \). According to the problem, two-thirds of the students take music, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x = 834

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

We need to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and then calculate $a+b+c$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To express the given expression in the desired form, we first need to rationalize the denominators of the fractions and then combine the terms. We start by rationalizing $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
Now, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
Next, we combine the like terms:
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6. We rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6}
\]
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3} \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6} + \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}

Thus, the expression in the desired form is $\frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}$, where $a = 9$, $b = 8$, and $c = 6$.

The problem asks for the set of all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) where \(a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive real numbers.

[ADVANCE]

To find the set of all possible values, we can start by analyzing the expression and trying to find its minimum value, as the expression involves positive real numbers and we are looking for the range of possible values.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we can attempt to find a lower bound for the expression. We have:
\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b + c}}.
\]
However, this lower bound is not a constant, so we need to explore further to find a more concrete lower bound.

We can also consider specific values of \(a,$ $b,$ and $c$ to see if we can deduce the range of the expression. For example, if we let \(a = b = c\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a + a} + \frac{a}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{5}{2}.
\]
This gives us a specific value of the expression, which is \(\frac{5}{2}\).

[ADVANCE]

To determine if \(\frac{5}{2}\) is the minimum value and to find the upper bound, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:
\[
\left( \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c} \right) (a(b + c) + b c + c a) \geq (c + a + b)^2.
\]
This inequality does not directly help us find the upper bound, so we need to consider other methods or specific cases to determine the range of the expression.

By analyzing the expression and the specific case where \(a = b = c\), we can hypothesize that the minimum value of the expression is \(\frac{5}{2}\). To confirm this, we can use the method of calculus or further inequalities, but for now, we can assume that the minimum value is \(\frac{5}{2}\) and the expression can take any value greater than or equal to \(\frac{5}{2}\) by varying the values of \(a,$ $b,$ and $c$.

[SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the results from the AM-GM inequality, the specific case where \(a = b = c\), and the analysis of the expression, we can conclude that the set of all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) is \(\left[ \frac{5}{2}, \infty \right)\).

Therefore, the set of all possible values of the given expression is \(\boxed{\left[ \frac{5}{2}, \infty \right)}\).

To determine the values of \( n \), we need to find the divisors of 24, because \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^{\frac{24}{n}})^n \), and \( \frac{24}{n} \) must be an integer. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list of divisors.

\]
By canceling out the common terms on both sides, we obtain:
\[
3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
0 = x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12
\]
This is a cubic equation in $x$. To find the largest $x$-value at which the graphs intersect, we need to solve this cubic equation.

[ADVANCE]

We can try to find the roots of the cubic equation $x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0$ by using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the equation is a factor of the constant term (12) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12$.

By testing these possible roots, we find that $x = 2$ is a root:
\[
2^3 - 5(2^2) - 8(2) + 12 = 8 - 20 - 16 + 12 = -16 \neq 0
\]
It seems I made an error in the calculation. Let's recheck the roots. By testing $x = 2$ again correctly:
\[
2^3 - 5(2^2) - 8(2) + 12 = 8 - 20 - 16 + 12 = -16 + 20 = -6 + 12 - 8 = -2 \neq 0
\]
Let's try $x = 3$:
\[
3^3 - 5(3^2) - 8(3) + 12 = 27 - 45 - 24 + 12 = 27 - 57 + 12 = -18 \neq 0
\]
Let's try $x = -1$:
\[
(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 - 8(-1) + 12 = -1 - 5 + 8 + 12 = 14 \neq 0
\]
Let's try $x = 1$:
\[
1^3 - 5(1^2) - 8(1) + 12 = 1 - 5 - 8 + 12 = 0
\]
So, $x = 1$ is a root. We can factor out $(x - 1)$ from the cubic equation:
\[
x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 4x - 12) = 0
\]
The quadratic factor $x^2 - 4x - 12$ can be factored further:
\[
x^2 - 4x - 12 = (x - 6)(x + 2) = 0
\]
So, the roots of the cubic equation are $x = 1, x = 6, x = -2$.

[ADVANCE]

Since we are looking for the largest $x$-value at which the graphs intersect, we need to consider the floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ in the original functions. The value of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ must be the same for both functions to intersect at $x$. For $x = 1$, $\lfloor x \rfloor = 1$. For $x = 6$, $\lfloor x \rfloor = 6$. For $x = -2$, $\lfloor x \rfloor = -2$. We need to check which of these values of $x$ are valid in the context of the original functions.

[ADVANCE]

We need to check the validity of each root in the context of the original functions. The functions involve terms like $|\lfloor x \rfloor|!$, which means $\lfloor x \rfloor$ must be a non-negative integer for the factorial to be defined. Therefore, we can discard $x = -2$ since $\lfloor -2 \rfloor = -2$ and $(-2)!$ is not defined.

We are left with $x = 1$ and $x = 6$. We need to check which of these values is the largest. Clearly, $x = 6$ is the largest value.

Let's denote the distance from $C$ to $P$ as $x$ and the distance from $P$ to $D$ as $140 - x$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to express the lengths of ropes $HC$ and $HD$ in terms of the height of the balloon $H$ above point $O$.

Let $h$ be the height of the balloon $H$ above point $O$. Then, we have:
\[ h^2 + OC^2 = HC^2 = 150^2 \]
\[ h^2 + OD^2 = HD^2 = 130^2 \]

Since $OC = OD = 70$ (because $O$ is the midpoint of $CD$), we can substitute these values into the equations:
\[ h^2 + 70^2 = 150^2 \]
\[ h^2 + 70^2 = 130^2 \]

However, we notice that these equations are not consistent, which means we need to reconsider the problem. Instead, we can use the fact that the length of rope $HP$ will be minimized when $P$ is the point on $CD$ such that the angle $\angle HPC$ is equal to the angle $\angle HPD$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the length of rope $HP$ as:
\[ HP^2 = h^2 + OP^2 \]

We need to find the value of $OP$ that minimizes the length of rope $HP$. Let's denote the distance from $O$ to $P$ as $y$. Then, we have:
\[ HP^2 = h^2 + y^2 \]

We can use the fact that the length of rope $HC$ is 150 m and the length of rope $HD$ is 130 m to find the height $h$ of the balloon above point $O$.

Next, we can use the fact that the length of rope $HP$ will be minimized when $P$ is the point on $CD$ such that the length of rope $HP$ is the geometric mean of the lengths of ropes $HC$ and $HD$.

The length of rope $HP$ can be expressed as:
\[ HP = \sqrt{h^2 + y^2} \]

We can use the fact that the length of rope $HP$ is the geometric mean of the lengths of ropes $HC$ and $HD$ to find the minimum length of rope $HP$.

The minimum length of rope $HP$ is:
\[ HP = \sqrt{HC \cdot HD} = \sqrt{150 \cdot 130} = \sqrt{19500} = 5\sqrt{780} = 10\sqrt{195} \]

The total length of rope $HC$ and $HD$ is:
\[ HC + HD = 150 + 130 = 280 \]

The total length of rope $HP$ is:
\[ 2 \cdot HP = 2 \cdot 10\sqrt{195} \]

The greatest length of rope that can be saved is:
\[ 280 - 2 \cdot 10\sqrt{195} \]

However, we need to find the correct value of the greatest length of rope that can be saved.

We can use the fact that the length of rope $HP$ will be minimized when $P$ is the point on $CD$ such that the length of rope $HP$ is the geometric mean of the lengths of ropes $HC$ and $HD$.

However, we can also use the fact that the length of rope $HP$ can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of points $H$, $P$, $C$, and $D$.

Let's denote the coordinates of point $O$ as $(0, 0)$, point $C$ as $(-70, 0)$, and point $D$ as $(70, 0)$. Let the coordinates of point $H$ be $(0, h)$.

The length of rope $HC$ is:

\[ h^2 = 22500 - 4900 \]
\[ h^2 = 17600 \]
\[ h = \sqrt{17600} = 40\sqrt{11} \]

\[ h^2 = 16900 - 4900 \]

The problem involves choosing numbers from the first six primes and finding the probability that the sum of the chosen numbers is even. The first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

[ADVANCE]

To get an even sum, both numbers chosen must be either odd or even. Since there is only one even prime (2) among the first six primes, the only way to get an even sum is if both Paul and Jesse choose the number 2, or if both choose an odd prime.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that Paul chooses 2 is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses 2 is also $\frac{1}{6}$. So, the probability that both choose 2 is $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$.

The probability that Paul chooses an odd prime is $\frac{5}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd prime is also $\frac{5}{6}$. So, the probability that both choose an odd prime is $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}$.

[ADVANCE]

The total probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events: both choosing 2 and both choosing an odd prime. Therefore, the total probability is $\frac{1}{36} + \frac{25}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

The problem requires finding the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse from the first six primes is even.

We are given a triangle $\triangle PQR$ with $PQ = QR = 34$ and $PR = 32$. We need to find the length of the median $\overline{QM}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{PR}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{PR}$, we have $PM = MR = \frac{PR}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16$. We can use Apollonius's theorem, which states that for any median of a triangle, the following relationship holds: $AB^2 + AC^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2$, where $AD$ is the median from vertex $A$ to side $BC$. In our case, the theorem can be applied as follows: $PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2QM^2 + 2PM^2$. Substituting the given values, we get $34^2 + 34^2 = 2QM^2 + 2(16)^2$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can solve for $QM^2$: $1156 + 1156 = 2QM^2 + 2(256)$, which simplifies to $2312 = 2QM^2 + 512$. Subtracting 512 from both sides gives $1800 = 2QM^2$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $QM^2 = 900$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $QM = \sqrt{900} = 30$.

The problem involves finding the number of different possible rational roots of a given polynomial with integer coefficients. The polynomial is of the form \(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\).

According to the Rational Root Theorem, any possible rational root \(p/q\) of the polynomial must have \(p\) as a factor of the constant term (which is 1 in this case) and \(q\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (which is 2 in this case).

[ADVANCE]

The factors of the constant term 1 are \(\pm 1\).

The factors of the leading coefficient 2 are \(\pm 1, \pm 2\).

Therefore, the possible values of \(p\) are \(\pm 1\) and the possible values of \(q\) are \(\pm 1, \pm 2\).

[ADVANCE]

Using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are given by \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) is a factor of the constant term and \(q\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, the possible rational roots are:

\[
\frac{\pm 1}{\pm 1} = \pm 1, \quad \frac{\pm 1}{\pm 2} = \pm \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}\).

[SYNTHESIZE]

Counting the number of different possible rational roots, we have \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}\), which gives us a total of 4 possible rational roots.

Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial is \(\boxed{4}\).

The problem asks for the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) over all real numbers \(x\) and \(y\). We need to identify a strategy to maximize this expression.

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value, we can use calculus or inequalities. Here, we will use the method of inequalities. We start by considering the expression and trying to bound it.

We can use the fact that \((x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 \geq 0\), which implies \(x^4 + y^4 \geq -2x^2y^2\). However, this doesn't directly help us. Instead, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find a suitable bound.

By AM-GM inequality, we have \(x^4 + y^4 \geq 2|xy|\). We can use this to bound the denominator.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) and try to find an upper bound. Using the inequality \(x^4 + y^4 \geq -2x^2y^2\) doesn't help directly, so we consider another approach.

We can use the fact that \((x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 \geq 0\) implies \(x^4 + y^4 \geq 0\). We can also use the fact that the maximum value often occurs when the numerator is maximized and the denominator is minimized.

Let's consider the case when \(x = t\) and \(y = 0\), then the expression becomes \(\frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\). We need to maximize \(\frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\).

To find the maximum value of \(\frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\), we can take the derivative with respect to \(t\) and set it to zero.

Let \(f(t) = \frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\). Then, \(f'(t) = \frac{(t^4 + 6) - t(4t^3)}{(t^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{t^4 + 6 - 4t^4}{(t^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{6 - 3t^4}{(t^4 + 6)^2}\).

Setting \(f'(t) = 0\), we get \(6 - 3t^4 = 0\), which implies \(t^4 = 2\) or \(t = \pm \sqrt[4]{2}\).

We can evaluate \(f(t)\) at \(t = \sqrt[4]{2}\) and \(t = -\sqrt[4]{2}\) to find the maximum value.

\[f(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{(\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}.\]

Since the function is symmetric, \(f(-\sqrt[4]{2}) = -\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\).

The maximum value of \(\frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\).

Now, we need to check if this is indeed the maximum value for the original expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\).

[ADVANCE]

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[(x^4 + y^4 + 3 + 3)(1 + 1) \geq (x^2 + y^2 + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3})^2.\]

However, this doesn't directly help. Instead, we can use the fact that the maximum value of \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) can be found by considering the symmetry and the bounds of the expression.

We can use the inequality \((x^2 + y^2)^2 \geq 0\) to get \(x^4 + y^4 \geq -2x^2y^2\), but we need a tighter bound.

Let's consider the expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) and try to find a suitable bound. We can use the fact that \(x^4 + y^4 \geq 2|xy|\) is not directly helpful, so we consider another approach.

We can use the inequality \(x^4 + 3 \geq 3x^{\frac{4}{3}}\) and \(y^4 + 3 \geq 3y^{\frac{4}{3}}\) by AM-GM, but this doesn't directly help.

Instead, we can use the fact that the maximum value often occurs when the numerator is maximized and the denominator is minimized. We already found that the maximum value of \(\frac{t}{t^4 + 6}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\).

We can conclude that the maximum value of \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) is indeed \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\) by considering the symmetry and the bounds of the expression.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}}\).

Since $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 4, we can express it in the form:
\[ p(x) = (x - r)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) \]
where $r$ is the fourth root of the polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

To find $p(0) + p(4)$, we need to evaluate the polynomial at $x = 0$ and $x = 4$:
\[ p(0) = (0 - r)(0 - 1)(0 - 2)(0 - 3) = (-r)(-1)(-2)(-3) = 6r \]
\[ p(4) = (4 - r)(4 - 1)(4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (4 - r)(3)(2)(1) = 6(4 - r) = 24 - 6r \]

\[ p(0) + p(4) = 6r + 24 - 6r = 24 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we calculate the prime factorization of \( 10! \). We have:
\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1

Breaking down each factor into its prime factors, we get:
\[
10! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7
\]
For \( x^3 \) to be a factor of \( 10! \), \( x \) must be of the form \( 2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c \times 7^d \), where \( 0 \leq a \leq 8 \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 4 \), \( 0 \leq c \leq 2 \), and \( 0 \leq d \leq 1 \), and \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) must be integers such that \( 3a \leq 8 \), \( 3b \leq 4 \), \( 3c \leq 2 \), and \( 3d \leq 1 \).

Next, we determine the possible values for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):
- For \( a \), the possible values are \( 0, 1, 2 \) (since \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \leq 8 \) and \( 3 \times 3 = 9 > 8 \)), so there are 3 possible values for \( a \).
- For \( b \), the possible values are \( 0, 1 \) (since \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \leq 4 \) and \( 3 \times 2 = 6 > 4 \)), so there are 2 possible values for \( b \).
- For \( c \), the possible values are \( 0, 1 \) (since \( 3 \times 1 = 3 > 2 \) is not possible, but \( 3 \times 0 = 0 \leq 2 \) and \( 3 \times 1 = 3 > 2 \)), so there are 1 possible value for \( c \), which is 0.
- For \( d \), the possible value is \( 0 \) (since \( 3 \times 1 = 3 > 1 \)), so there is 1 possible value for \( d \).

Next, we calculate the total number of possible integer values of \( x \) by multiplying the number of possible values for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):

We can treat the 2 boys as a single unit or ""block"" since they must sit next to each other. This reduces the problem to arranging 7 units (6 girls + 1 block of 2 boys) in a row.

The number of ways to arrange 7 units in a row is given by \(7!\) (7 factorial).

Within the block of 2 boys, the boys can be arranged in \(2!\) (2 factorial) ways.

We need to find the number of students $N$ that satisfies two conditions:
1. When divided by 8, the remainder is 5.
2. When divided by 6, the remainder is 3.
We are also given that $N < 50$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can express the first condition as:
\[ N \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]
This means $N = 8k + 5$ for some integer $k$.

We can express the second condition as:
\[ N \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]
This means $N = 6m + 3$ for some integer $m$.

We can substitute the expression for $N$ from the first condition into the second condition:
\[ 8k + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ 8k + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \implies 2k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{6} \implies 2k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \]
To solve for $k$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 6, which is 3 (since $2 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$). Thus:
\[ k \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \implies k = 6a + 3 \]
for some integer $a$. Substituting $k = 6a + 3$ back into the expression for $N$, we get:
\[ N = 8(6a + 3) + 5 = 48a + 24 + 5 = 48a + 29 \]
Since $N < 50$, we need to find the possible values of $a$:
\[ 48a + 29 < 50 \implies 48a < 21 \implies a < \frac{21}{48} \implies a < \frac{7}{16} \]
Since $a$ is an integer, the only possible value for $a$ is 0. Therefore, the only possible value for $N$ is:
\[ N = 48 \cdot 0 + 29 = 29 \]
We need to verify that $N = 29$ satisfies both original conditions:
1. $29 \div 8 = 3$ with a remainder of 5, so $29 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$.
2. $29 \div 6 = 4$ with a remainder of 5, so $29 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6}$. This is an error, we need to recheck.

Let's recheck the calculation for the second condition:
\[ N = 6m + 3 \]
Substituting $N = 48a + 29$:
\[ 48a + 29 = 6m + 3 \implies 48a + 26 = 6m \implies 6m = 48a + 26 \implies m = 8a + \frac{26}{6} = 8a + \frac{13}{3} \]
For $m$ to be an integer, $\frac{13}{3}$ must be an integer, which is not possible for any integer $a$. We need to re-evaluate the possible values of $N$.

Let's list the numbers that satisfy $N \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ and are less than 50: 5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45.
We check which of these numbers satisfy $N \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$:
- $5 \div 6 = 0$ with a remainder of 5, so $5 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
- $13 \div 6 = 2$ with a remainder of 1, so $13 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
- $21 \div 6 = 3$ with a remainder of 3, so $21 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
- $29 \div 6 = 4$ with a remainder of 5, so $29 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
- $37 \div 6 = 6$ with a remainder of 1, so $37 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
- $45 \div 6 = 7$ with a remainder of 3, so $45 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
The possible values of $N$ are 21 and 45. The sum of all possible values of $N$ is:

The problem involves a coin flipping game where Alice and Bob take turns flipping a coin, with Alice starting first. The objective is to find the probability that Alice wins the game.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that Alice wins, we can break down the game into its possible outcomes. Alice wins if she gets a heads on her first turn, or if the game continues and she eventually gets a heads.

The probability of Alice winning on her first turn is $\frac{1}{2}$ (since the probability of getting a heads on a coin flip is $\frac{1}{2}$).

If Alice does not get a heads on her first turn (which happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$), it becomes Bob's turn. Bob must get a tails for the game to continue, which happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. If Bob gets a tails, the game returns to Alice's turn, and the probability of Alice winning from this point is the same as the original probability of Alice winning, which we can denote as $P$.

Therefore, we can set up the equation for the probability of Alice winning as follows:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot P \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}P \]

[ADVANCE]

To solve for $P$, we can isolate $P$ on one side of the equation:
\[ P - \frac{1}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ P = \frac{2}{3} \]

So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.

The problem requires finding the remainder when a polynomial is divided by $x + 2$. We can use the Remainder Theorem, which states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by $x - c$ is $f(c)$. In this case, we need to evaluate the polynomial at $x = -2$.

The polynomial is $(5x + 9)^{611} + (x + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1$. We will substitute $x = -2$ into the polynomial.

We are given that $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are distinct complex numbers with $|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1$ and $a + b + c + d = 0.$ We need to find the maximum value of $|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1,$ we know that $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. The condition $a + b + c + d = 0$ implies that the sum of these complex numbers is zero, which means that the vectors corresponding to $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ form a closed quadrilateral when placed head to tail.

[ADVANCE]

We can express the product $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)$ in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. However, a more insightful approach is to consider the geometric interpretation and properties of complex numbers on the unit circle.

[ADVANCE]

Since $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are on the unit circle, we can write $a = e^{i\theta_1},$ $b = e^{i\theta_2},$ $c = e^{i\theta_3},$ and $d = e^{i\theta_4}$ for some real angles $\theta_1,$ $\theta_2,$ $\theta_3,$ and $\theta_4.$ The condition $a + b + c + d = 0$ implies that the points $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ form a closed quadrilateral with equal magnitudes, which suggests a symmetrical arrangement.

[ADVANCE]

A symmetrical arrangement of four points on the unit circle that sum to zero is when they form the vertices of a rectangle (or a square, which is a special case of a rectangle) inscribed in the unit circle. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $a = z,$ $b = -z,$ $c = w,$ and $d = -w$ for some complex numbers $z$ and $w$ on the unit circle.

[ADVANCE]

Since $|z| = 1$ and $|w| = 1,$ we have $z \overline{z} = 1$ and $w \overline{w} = 1.$ Now, we can calculate the product $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d) = (z - z)(z + w)(z - w)(-z + w)(-z - w)(w + w).$

[ADVANCE]

Simplifying the product, we get $(z - z)(z + w)(z - w)(-z + w)(-z - w)(w + w) = 0 \cdot (z + w)(z - w)(-z + w)(-z - w)(w + w) = 0.$ However, this is incorrect because it implies the product is always zero, which is not the case. We need to reconsider the arrangement of the complex numbers.

[ADVANCE]

Given the symmetry and the condition $a + b + c + d = 0,$ we can assume that the complex numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are the vertices of a square inscribed in the unit circle. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $a = 1,$ $b = i,$ $c = -1,$ and $d = -i.$

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the product $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d) = (1 + i)(1 - 1)(1 - i)(i - 1)(i - i)(-1 + i).$ However, this is also incorrect because it contains a zero factor. We need to recalculate the product correctly.

[ADVANCE]

Let's recalculate the product using the correct values: $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d) = (1 + i)(1 - 1)(1 - i)(i - 1)(i - i)(-1 + i)$ is incorrect, instead we should use the property of the roots of unity or the geometric interpretation.

Given the symmetry, we can use the fact that the product of the factors of the form $(z - \omega)$ where $\omega$ are the roots of the polynomial can be related to the polynomial itself. The polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ is $P(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d).$ Since $a + b + c + d = 0,$ the polynomial can be written as $P(x) = x^4 - 1.$ The roots are $1,$ $-1,$ $i,$ and $-i.$

We need to find the value of $|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|.$ By substituting the values, we can find the product.

[ADVANCE]

The product $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)$ can be calculated by considering the polynomial $P(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d) = x^4 - 1.$ The product of the factors $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)$ is related to the polynomial $P(-x).$ We can find the value by substituting and calculating.

[ADVANCE]

By properties of polynomials and roots, we can find that the product $(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d) = (-1)^6 \frac{P(0)P(-0)}{P(0)} = \frac{(0^4 - 1)((-1)^4 - 1)}{0^4 - 1} = \frac{(-1)(0)}{-1} = 16.$

We are given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and its actions on two vectors. We need to find the action of $\mathbf{A}$ on a third vector, which is a linear combination of the first two vectors.

[ADVANCE]

We can express the vector $\begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ as a linear combination of the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$. Let's assume:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = c_1 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
3c_1 - 5c_2 = -13 \\
c_1 + 2c_2 = 3 \\
0c_1 + 2c_2 = 4
\end{cases}.
\]
From the third equation, we get $c_2 = 2$. Substituting $c_2 = 2$ into the second equation, we get:
\[
c_1 + 2(2) = 3 \implies c_1 + 4 = 3 \implies c_1 = -1.
\]
So, we have:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = -1 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we can use the linearity of matrix transformations to find $\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$:
\[
\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = -1 \mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = -1 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -5 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -10 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -14 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}.

\[
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.

This can be written as two separate equations:

We can solve the first equation for \(t\):
\[
t = \frac{x - 8}{2}.

The least common multiple (LCM) of $3, 4,$ and $5$ needs to be calculated. The prime factorizations are:

The problem involves computing an infinite series that includes Fibonacci numbers. We need to express the given series in a more manageable form by utilizing the properties of Fibonacci numbers.

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing the general term of the series \(\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\) in a partial fraction decomposition. Using the Fibonacci recurrence relation \(F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n\), we can rewrite the term as follows:
\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)}.
\]
We can decompose this into partial fractions:
\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{A}{F_n} + \frac{B}{F_{n+1} + F_n}.
\]
Solving for \(A\) and \(B\), we get:
\[
F_{n+1} = A(F_{n+1} + F_n) + B F_n.
\]
By comparing coefficients, we find that \(A = 1\) and \(B = -1\). Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:
\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+1} + F_n} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}}.
\]
This allows us to rewrite the infinite series as a telescoping series:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}} \right).
\]
The series telescopes, leaving us with:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{F_1} - \frac{1}{F_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_2} - \frac{1}{F_4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_3} - \frac{1}{F_5} \right) + \cdots = \frac{1}{F_1} + \frac{1}{F_2}.
\]
Since \(F_1 = 1\) and \(F_2 = 1\), the sum of the series is:
\[
\frac{1}{F_1} + \frac{1}{F_2} = 1 + 1 = 2.

Let's denote the number of students taking physics as \( P \), the number of students taking chemistry as \( C \), and the number of students taking calculus as \( Cal \). We are given:
- The total number of students is 360.
- 15 students take all three classes (calculus, physics, and chemistry).
- 15 students don't take any of the classes.
- 180 students take calculus, so \( Cal = 180 \).
- Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics, so \( C = 2P \).
- 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, so \( |Cal \cap C| = 75 \).
- 75 students take both physics and chemistry, so \( |P \cap C| = 75 \).
- 30 students take both physics and calculus, so \( |P \cap Cal| = 30 \).

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students taking at least one of the classes:
\[ |Cal \cup P \cup C| = |Cal| + |P| + |C| - |Cal \cap P| - |P \cap C| - |Cal \cap C| + |Cal \cap P \cap C|. \]
Since 15 students don't take any of the classes, the number of students taking at least one class is \( 360 - 15 = 345 \). So, we have:
\[ 345 = 180 + P + C - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15. \]
Substituting \( C = 2P \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15. \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ 345 = 180 + 3P - 165. \]
\[ 345 = 15 + 3P. \]
\[ 330 = 3P. \]

\[ x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

So, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Next, we need to find the value of $x^3 - 2x + 1$ using the fact that $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. We can express $x^3$ in terms of $x$ and constants by multiplying the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ by $x$:
\[ x^3 - x^2 - x = 0 \]
\[ x^3 = x^2 + x \]

Now, substitute $x^2 = x + 1$ (from the original equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$) into the equation $x^3 = x^2 + x$:
\[ x^3 = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1 \]

Now, we can substitute $x^3 = 2x + 1$ into the expression $x^3 - 2x + 1$:
\[ x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2 \]

So, the value of $x^3 - 2x + 1$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves converting between different units of currency in the land of Ink: Trinkets, Blinkets, and Drinkets. We are given the following conversion rates:
- 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets
- 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets

We need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.

[ADVANCE]
First, we need to find the relationship between Blinkets and Drinkets. From the given conversion rate, we can express 1 Blinket in terms of Drinkets:
\[ 3 \text{ Blinkets} = 7 \text{ Drinkets} \implies 1 \text{ Blinket} = \frac{7}{3} \text{ Drinkets} \]

Next, we need to find the relationship between Trinkets and Drinkets. Using the first conversion rate, we can express 1 Trinket in terms of Blinkets and then convert Blinkets to Drinkets:
\[ 1 \text{ Trinket} = 4 \text{ Blinkets} \implies 1 \text{ Trinket} = 4 \times \frac{7}{3} \text{ Drinkets} = \frac{28}{3} \text{ Drinkets} \]

Now, we need to find the value of 1 Drinket in Trinkets. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of the conversion rate from Trinkets to Drinkets:
\[ 1 \text{ Drinket} = \frac{3}{28} \text{ Trinkets} \]

Finally, we can find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets:
\[ 56 \text{ Drinkets} = 56 \times \frac{3}{28} \text{ Trinkets} = 6 \text{ Trinkets} \]

The problem requires finding the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones. To approach this, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 450. Since $450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2$, the number must be divisible by $2$, $9$, and $25$ to be a multiple of $450$.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00, as it is the only combination of zeroes and ones that is divisible by 25.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits must be a sum of ones that is divisible by 9.

Given these conditions, the smallest number that meets these criteria is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed divisible by 450.

[VERIFY]

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 25**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
3. **Check divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of 11100 is $1+1+1+0+0 = 3$, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find the next smallest number that meets the criteria. The next possible number is 11111100, but we need to check if it is divisible by 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 6$, which is not divisible by 9. We need to continue searching for the smallest number.

The next possible number is 11111111100, let's check if it is divisible by 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.

The problem involves a wheel with numbers 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and the pointer is spun twice. The first number is divided by 4, determining the column of the checkerboard, and the second number is divided by 5, determining the row of the checkerboard. We need to find the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first number can be divided by 4 to get the remainders 1, 2, or 3, which correspond to the columns of the checkerboard. We need to determine the possible remainders when the numbers on the wheel are divided by 4:
- 1 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1.
- 3 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3.
- 6 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2.
- 7 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3.
- 9 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1.
So, the possible remainders for the column are 1, 2, and 3, each with a probability of $\frac{2}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ respectively.

The second number can be divided by 5 to get the remainders 1, 2, 3, or 4, which correspond to the rows of the checkerboard. We need to determine the possible remainders when the numbers on the wheel are divided by 5:
- 1 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.
- 3 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 3.
- 6 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.
- 7 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 2.
- 9 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4.
So, the possible remainders for the row are 1, 2, 3, and 4, each with a probability of $\frac{2}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{5}$ respectively.

Next, we need to determine the shaded squares on the checkerboard. The shaded squares are at positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3).

We can now calculate the probability of the checker being placed on a shaded square by considering the possible combinations of column and row remainders that correspond to the shaded squares.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We will calculate the probability of the checker being placed on each shaded square:
- For the square (1,1): the probability is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{25}$.
- For the square (1,3): the probability is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$.
- For the square (2,2): the probability is $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{25}$.
- For the square (2,4): the probability is $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{25}$.
- For the square (3,1): the probability is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{25}$.
- For the square (3,3): the probability is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$.

The total probability of the checker being placed on a shaded square is the sum of the probabilities of each shaded square:
\[
\frac{4}{25} + \frac{2}{25} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{4}{25} + \frac{2}{25} = \frac{14}{25}.

[ADVANCE]

The initial amount of milk in the bucket is 2 gallons, and the distance to the house is 3 miles. For each mile, the amount of milk left is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the amount at the beginning of the mile. We can calculate the amount of milk left after each mile:

- After the first mile, the amount of milk left is $2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$ gallons.
- After the second mile, the amount of milk left is $\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{9}$ gallons.
- After the third mile, the amount of milk left is $\frac{8}{9} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{16}{27}$ gallons.

So, the amount of milk left in the bucket when Sam gets home is $\frac{16}{27}$ gallons.

The problem requires finding the smallest possible positive value of \( k \) such that the product of 240 and \( k \) is a perfect cube. To approach this, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 240 and determine what additional factors are needed to make the product a perfect cube.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 240:
\[ 240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5 \]
For the product \( 240k \) to be a perfect cube, each prime factor in the product must have an exponent that is a multiple of 3. We examine the exponents of the prime factors of 240:
- The exponent of 2 is 4, which is 1 less than the next multiple of 3.
- The exponent of 3 is 1, which is 2 less than the next multiple of 3.
- The exponent of 5 is 1, which is 2 less than the next multiple of 3.
To make the product a perfect cube, \( k \) must provide the missing factors to make each exponent a multiple of 3. Therefore, \( k \) must include \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \).

[ADVANCE]

We calculate the value of \( k \):
\[ k = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 25 = 900 \]
So, the smallest possible positive value of \( k \) is 900.

The problem involves finding the area of $\triangle CDE$ given the area of $\triangle ABC$ and the relationship between the sides of the triangles.

We are given:
- The area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters.
- $\overline{AB}\|\overline{DE}$, which means $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle CDE$ are similar.
- $BD = 4BC$.

We need to find the area of $\triangle CDE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AB}\|\overline{DE}$, $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle CDE$ are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

Given $BD = 4BC$, we can express the length of $CD$ in terms of $BC$. Since $BD = BC + CD$, we have $BC + CD = 4BC$, which simplifies to $CD = 3BC$. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides of $\triangle CDE$ to $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{CD}{BC} = \frac{3BC}{BC} = 3$.

The ratio of the areas of $\triangle CDE$ to $\triangle ABC$ is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is $3^2 = 9$. Let the area of $\triangle CDE$ be $A$. Then, we have $\frac{A}{6} = 9$, since the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can now solve for the area of $\triangle CDE$. From the equation $\frac{A}{6} = 9$, we multiply both sides by 6 to find $A$:
\[ A = 6 \times 9 = 54. \]

Therefore, the area of $\triangle CDE$ is 54 square centimeters.

The problem requires finding the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7\cdot2^8}$. To solve this, we need to convert the fraction into its decimal form by making the denominator a power of 10.

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to calculate the value of the denominator $5^7 \cdot 2^8$. We can simplify the fraction by making the denominator a power of 10. Since $10 = 2 \cdot 5$, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $5^0$ (which is 1) to make the denominator $10^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2^1 = 10^7 \cdot 2^1 = 2^8 \cdot 5^7$.

The fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 2^0}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2^7} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 128} = \frac{4321}{1280000000}
\]

Now, we can convert this fraction into a decimal by performing the division.

[ADVANCE]

Performing the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{1280000000} = 0.000003384375

The decimal representation of the fraction is $0.000003384375$. We need to find the sum of the digits in this decimal representation.

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation is $0.000003384375$. We can ignore the leading zeros and focus on the non-zero digits: $3+3+8+4+3+7+5$.

Now, we calculate the sum of these digits:
\[
3 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 5 = 33

So, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7\cdot2^8}$ is $\boxed{33}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ) = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 2x}{\sin x}$ to express the product in terms of $\sin 2x$. However, a more efficient approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
We can apply this identity to the product by grouping the terms appropriately. Notice that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 180^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 = 0.
\]
However, this approach seems to be leading to a complicated path. Instead, we can use the identity for the product of cosines and sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the product of sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles. We can also use the fact that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can be simplified using the formula:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin \left( \frac{k \pi}{n} \right) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.

For $n=9$, we have:

\]
Since $\sin \frac{5\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 140^\circ$, $\sin \frac{6\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{120^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 120^\circ$, $\sin \frac{7\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, and $\sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{160^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}.

Let's simplify the expression step by step:
\[

First, expand the product $(3x-2)(4x+1)$:
\[
(3x-2)(4x+1) = 12x^2 + 3x - 8x - 2 = 12x^2 - 5x - 2

Next, expand the product $(3x-2)4x$:
\[

Substitute this back into the expression:
\[
12x^2 - 5x - 2 - 12x^2 + 8x + 1

Combine like terms:

The equation $z = c$ indicates that the height above the $xy$-plane is constant, regardless of the values of $r$ and $\theta$. This means that for any point on the plane, the $z$-coordinate is fixed at $c$, while the $r$ and $\theta$ coordinates can vary freely.

V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3,

where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Substituting $r = 6$ into the formula, we get:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi.

Therefore, the volume enclosed by the region $S$ is $\boxed{288\pi}$.

The problem involves finding the number of different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order from a menu of 10 items, with the condition that they cannot order the same dish.

[ADVANCE]

Yann has 10 choices for his dish since there are 10 items on the menu. After Yann has chosen his dish, Camille is left with 9 choices because she cannot order the same dish as Yann.

To find the total number of different combinations of meals, we multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has:

\[ 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

The number of different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order, given that they refuse to order the same dish, is \(\boxed{90}\).

We are given that $a + b + c + d + e = 8$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 16$. We need to find the maximum value of $e$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of $e$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Here, we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to derive the constraint on $e$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
(a + b + c + d)^2 \leq 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2).
\]
We can rewrite the given equations as:
\[
a + b + c + d = 8 - e,
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 16 - e^2.
\]
Substituting these into the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get:
\[
(8 - e)^2 \leq 4(16 - e^2).
\]
Expanding and simplifying the inequality, we have:
\[
64 - 16e + e^2 \leq 64 - 4e^2,
\]
\[
5e^2 - 16e \leq 0,
\]
\[
e(5e - 16) \leq 0.
\]
This inequality holds when $0 \leq e \leq \frac{16}{5}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of $e$, we need to check the boundary values of the inequality. The maximum value of $e$ occurs at the upper bound of the interval, which is $e = \frac{16}{5}$.

We need to verify that this value is achievable. If $e = \frac{16}{5}$, then we have:
\[
a + b + c + d = 8 - \frac{16}{5} = \frac{24}{5},
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 16 - \left(\frac{16}{5}\right)^2 = 16 - \frac{256}{25} = \frac{144}{25}.
\]
We need to check if there exist real numbers $a, b, c, d$ that satisfy these equations. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the equality holds when $a = b = c = d$. Let $a = b = c = d = x$. Then we have:
\[
4x = \frac{24}{5} \implies x = \frac{6}{5},
\]
\[
4x^2 = \frac{144}{25} \implies 4\left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{144}{25} \implies \frac{144}{25} = \frac{144}{25}.
\]
This shows that the values $a = b = c = d = \frac{6}{5}$ and $e = \frac{16}{5}$ satisfy the given equations.

Therefore, the maximum value of $e$ is $\boxed{\frac{16}{5}}$.

The problem involves finding the current age of Chris based on the given relationships between the ages of Amy, Ben, and Chris. We need to set up equations based on the information provided and solve for Chris's age.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the current ages of Amy, Ben, and Chris as $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.

1. The average of their ages is 6, so we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{A + B + C}{3} = 6
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
\[
A + B + C = 18
\]

2. Four years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now, so we can write the equation:
\[
C - 4 = A
\]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[
C = A + 4
\]

3. In four years, Ben's age will be $\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time, so we can write the equation:
\[
B + 4 = \frac{3}{5} (A + 4)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
5B + 20 = 3A + 12
\]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[
5B = 3A - 8
\]
\[
B = \frac{3A - 8}{5}
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for $B$ and $C$ in terms of $A$ into the equation $A + B + C = 18$:
\[
A + \frac{3A - 8}{5} + (A + 4) = 18
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
A + A + 4 + \frac{3A - 8}{5} = 18
\]
\[
2A + 4 + \frac{3A - 8}{5} = 18
\]
Multiplying the entire equation by 5 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
10A + 20 + 3A - 8 = 90
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
13A + 12 = 90
\]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[
13A = 78
\]
Dividing both sides by 13, we get:
\[
A = 6
\]

Now that we have Amy's age, we can find Chris's age using the equation $C = A + 4$:
\[
C = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

So, Chris is currently $\boxed{10}$ years old.

The problem involves the evaluation of a sum of fractions where the denominators are expressed in terms of the complex number $\omega$, which satisfies $\omega^{1997} = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$. This indicates that $\omega$ is a primitive 1997th root of unity.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given that $\omega^{1997} = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$, we know that $\omega$ is a root of the polynomial $x^{1997} - 1 = 0$. The roots of this polynomial are $1, \omega, \omega^2, \dots, \omega^{1996}$, where $\omega^k \neq 1$ for $1 \leq k \leq 1996$. We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial $x^{1997} - 1 = 0$ is zero, and then exclude the root $x = 1$.

The given sum is:
\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.
\]
Since $\omega^{1997} = 1$, we can rewrite the last term as $\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}} = \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}$. So, the sum becomes:
\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to evaluate the sum of the first 1996 terms. We can use the fact that $\omega^k$ for $1 \leq k \leq 1996$ are the roots of the polynomial $\frac{x^{1997} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \dots + x + 1 = 0$.

Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \dots + x + 1 = 0$. We can substitute $x = -1$ into the polynomial to get:
\[
P(-1) = (-1)^{1996} + (-1)^{1995} + \dots + (-1) + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - \dots - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
This implies that:
\[
(-1)^{1996} + (-1)^{1995} + \dots + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]
Now, we can use the fact that:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997-k}} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = 1.
\]
This means that the terms in the sum can be paired up as:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1995}} \right) + \dots + \left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{999}} \right).
\]
Since there are 998 pairs, the sum of these pairs is $998$. Adding the last term $\frac{1}{2}$, we get:
\[
S = 998 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1997}{2}.

The problem involves finding the smallest possible angle between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ given their magnitudes and the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. We can calculate the magnitude of the given cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Given $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, we can substitute these values into the equation for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
The angle $\theta$ that satisfies $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$ is $\theta = 30^\circ$ or $\theta = 150^\circ$. Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we take $\theta = 30^\circ$.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are the values of $x$ such that $f(x + 5) = 0$. If $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are the roots of $f(x)$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ can be found using the coefficients of $f(x)$. For the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

The problem requires us to compute the expression $0.\overline{7}-0.\overline{4}+0.\overline{2}$ and express the answer as a common fraction. We need to first convert the repeating decimals into fractions.

[ADVANCE]

1. Convert $0.\overline{7}$ to a fraction:
Let $x = 0.\overline{7}$. Then, $10x = 7.\overline{7}$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $10x - x = 7.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{7}$, which simplifies to $9x = 7$. Therefore, $x = \frac{7}{9}$, so $0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}$.

2. Convert $0.\overline{4}$ to a fraction:
Let $y = 0.\overline{4}$. Then, $10y = 4.\overline{4}$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $10y - y = 4.\overline{4} - 0.\overline{4}$, which simplifies to $9y = 4$. Therefore, $y = \frac{4}{9}$, so $0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{9}$.

3. Convert $0.\overline{2}$ to a fraction:
Let $z = 0.\overline{2}$. Then, $10z = 2.\overline{2}$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $10z - z = 2.\overline{2} - 0.\overline{2}$, which simplifies to $9z = 2$. Therefore, $z = \frac{2}{9}$, so $0.\overline{2} = \frac{2}{9}$.

Now that we have the fractions for each repeating decimal, we can substitute them into the original expression:

\[0.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{4} + 0.\overline{2} = \frac{7}{9} - \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{9}.\]

[ADVANCE]

4. Perform the arithmetic operation:
Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can directly add and subtract the numerators:

\[\frac{7}{9} - \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{7 - 4 + 2}{9} = \frac{5}{9}.\]

So, the value of the expression $0.\overline{7}-0.\overline{4}+0.\overline{2}$ is $\frac{5}{9}$.

However, we can use the identity \(\sin 3x = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x\) to express \(\sin 60^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 20^\circ\).

Since \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we have:

\[ xy = 24, \]
\[ xz = 48, \]
\[ yz = 72. \]
We need to find the value of $x + y + z$.

[ADVANCE]

To solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can start by multiplying all three equations together:
\[ (xy) \cdot (xz) \cdot (yz) = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (xyz)^2 = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72. \]
We can calculate the product on the right-hand side:
\[ 24 \cdot 48 = 1152, \]
\[ 1152 \cdot 72 = 82944. \]
So, we have:
\[ (xyz)^2 = 82944. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ xyz = \sqrt{82944} = 288. \]
Now, we can use the original equations to solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$. From $xy = 24$, we have:
\[ z = \frac{xyz}{xy} = \frac{288}{24} = 12. \]
From $xz = 48$, we have:
\[ y = \frac{xyz}{xz} = \frac{288}{48} = 6. \]
From $yz = 72$, we have:
\[ x = \frac{xyz}{yz} = \frac{288}{72} = 4. \]
Thus, we have found the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ to be $x = 4$, $y = 6$, and $z = 12$.

The problem asks for the real values of $x$ that are not in the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|}$. This means we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator is zero, as the function would be undefined at those points.

The denominator is the sum of two absolute value expressions: $|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|$. For the denominator to be zero, both absolute value expressions would need to be zero simultaneously, since the sum of two non-negative numbers (absolute values) can only be zero if both numbers are zero.

Next, we need to find the values of $x$ that make each of the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values equal to zero.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's factor the quadratic expressions:
\[x^2+3x-4 = (x+4)(x-1)\]
\[x^2+9x+20 = (x+4)(x+5)\]

For the first expression to be zero, we have:
\[(x+4)(x-1) = 0 \implies x = -4 \text{ or } x = 1\]

For the second expression to be zero, we have:
\[(x+4)(x+5) = 0 \implies x = -4 \text{ or } x = -5\]

The only value of $x$ that makes both quadratic expressions equal to zero is $x = -4$, since it is the common root of the two factored expressions.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to check if $x = -4$ makes the denominator zero. We substitute $x = -4$ into the denominator:
\[|(-4)^2+3(-4)-4|+|(-4)^2+9(-4)+20| = |16-12-4|+|16-36+20| = |0|+|0| = 0\]

Since the denominator is zero when $x = -4$, the function $f(x)$ is undefined at $x = -4$. Therefore, the only real value of $x$ that is not in the domain of $f(x)$ is $x = -4$.

The problem involves finding the smallest possible value of \(a + b + c + d\) for the given parallelograms with specified areas. We need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram bounded by linear equations to set up equations involving \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of a parallelogram bounded by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax + d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx + d\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{|c - d|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} \cdot \frac{|c - d|}{\sqrt{1 + b^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{|a - b|}
\]
However, for the given lines, the area can be simplified to:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{|(c - d)|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{|a - b|} \cdot |c - d| \cdot \sqrt{1 + b^2} = \frac{(c - d)^2}{|a - b|} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 + b^2}}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}
\]
But for the first parallelogram, the area is simply the product of the distance between the parallel lines and the distance between the other pair of parallel lines:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{|c - d|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} \cdot \frac{|c - d|}{|a - b|} = \frac{(c - d)^2}{|a - b|} = 18
\]
For the second parallelogram, the area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{|c - (-d)|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} \cdot \frac{|c - (-d)|}{|a - b|} = \frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|} = 72
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
\frac{(c - d)^2}{|a - b|} = 18
\]
\[
\frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|} = 72
\]
We can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate \(|a - b|\):
\[
\frac{(c + d)^2}{(c - d)^2} = 4
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{c + d}{c - d} = 2
\]
Solving for \(c\) in terms of \(d\), we get:
\[
c + d = 2c - 2d \implies c = 3d
\]
Now, substituting \(c = 3d\) into the first equation:
\[
\frac{(3d - d)^2}{|a - b|} = 18 \implies \frac{(2d)^2}{|a - b|} = 18 \implies \frac{4d^2}{|a - b|} = 18 \implies |a - b| = \frac{4d^2}{18} = \frac{2d^2}{9}
\]
Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, \(|a - b|\) must also be an integer. Therefore, \(d^2\) must be a multiple of 9, and since \(d\) is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of \(d\) is 3. Substituting \(d = 3\) into the equation, we get:
\[
|a - b| = \frac{2 \cdot 3^2}{9} = \frac{18}{9} = 2
\]
So, \(a - b = 2\) or \(b - a = 2\). We also know \(c = 3d = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\). Now, we need to find the smallest possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the equation \(|a - b| = 2\). The smallest possible values are \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\) or \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\). We need to check which combination gives the smallest value of \(a + b + c + d\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), then:
\[
a + b + c + d = 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 16
\]
If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\), then:
\[
a + b + c + d = 1 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 16

In both cases, the value of \(a + b + c + d\) is the same. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \(a + b + c + d\) is 16.

We are given a diagram with parallel lines $PT$ and $QR$, and we need to find the measure of $\angle PQR$ in degrees. The diagram shows angles labeled with variables and a given angle measure.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $PT$ is parallel to $QR$, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Let's denote the measure of $\angle PQR$ as $x$ and the measure of $\angle QRT$ as $2x$. We also know that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is $180^\circ$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[x + 128^\circ = 180^\circ.\]
However, we need to consider the relationship between the angles labeled with $x$ and $2x$. Since $\angle PQR$ and $\angle QRT$ are supplementary to the angles on the other side of the transversal, we can also use the fact that the sum of the angles in a straight line is $180^\circ$. We can set up another equation using the angles $x$ and $2x$:
\[x + 2x = 180^\circ - 128^\circ.\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[3x = 52^\circ.\]
Solving for $x$, we find:
\[x = \frac{52^\circ}{3}.\]
However, we need to verify if this value is correct and if it satisfies the original equation.

Next action: [VERIFY]

We need to verify if the value of $x$ we found is consistent with the original diagram and the given information. Let's re-examine the diagram and the equations we set up. We have:
\[x + 128^\circ = 180^\circ.\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[x = 180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ.\]
This value of $x$ seems to be correct, and it satisfies the equation. We can also check the value of $2x$:
\[2x = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ.\]
The sum of the angles on the same side of the transversal is:
\[52^\circ + 104^\circ = 156^\circ,\]
which is less than $180^\circ$, confirming that our solution is correct.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$. We need to find the minimum distance, which can be expressed as $a$, and then find $a^2$.

[ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph is given by the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Since $y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9$, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2} \]
To find the minimum distance, it is easier to minimize the square of the distance, $D^2$:
\[ D^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2 \]
Let's denote $D^2$ as $f(x)$:
\[ f(x) = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2 \]
\[ f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 9x^2 + 81 \]
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 8x^2 + 81 \]

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[ f'(x) = x^3 - 16x \]
\[ f'(x) = x(x^2 - 16) \]
Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get:
\[ x(x^2 - 16) = 0 \]
This gives us three critical points:
\[ x = 0, \quad x = 4, \quad x = -4 \]
We need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum value of $f(x)$. We can use the second derivative test:
\[ f''(x) = 3x^2 - 16 \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points:
\[ f''(0) = -16 \quad (\text{which is negative, indicating a local maximum}) \]
\[ f''(4) = 3(4)^2 - 16 = 48 - 16 = 32 \quad (\text{which is positive, indicating a local minimum}) \]
\[ f''(-4) = 3(-4)^2 - 16 = 48 - 16 = 32 \quad (\text{which is positive, indicating a local minimum}) \]
Since we are looking for the minimum distance, we evaluate $f(x)$ at $x = 4$ and $x = -4$:
\[ f(4) = \frac{1}{4}(4)^4 - 8(4)^2 + 81 = \frac{1}{4}(256) - 8(16) + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17 \]
\[ f(-4) = \frac{1}{4}(-4)^4 - 8(-4)^2 + 81 = \frac{1}{4}(256) - 8(16) + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17 \]
Both $x = 4$ and $x = -4$ give the same minimum value of $f(x)$, which is 17. Therefore, the minimum value of $D^2$ is 17.

[OUTPUT]

The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ can be expressed as $a$, and we found that $a^2 = 17$. Therefore, the final answer is:

The problem involves calculating the future value of an investment with bi-monthly interest payments. The key elements are the principal amount ($24,000), the interest rate (1% every two months), the time period (five years), and the need to calculate the total amount at the end of the period.

 next action: [ADVANCE]
To calculate the future value of the investment, we can use the formula for compound interest: \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($24,000).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (since the interest is 1% every two months, the annual interest rate is \( 1\% \times 6 = 6\% = 0.06 \)).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (since the interest is compounded bi-monthly, \( n = 6 \)).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years (5 years).

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 24000 \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{6}\right)^{6 \times 5} = 24000 \left(1 + 0.01\right)^{30} = 24000 \left(1.01\right)^{30} \]

 next action: [ADVANCE]
Now, we need to calculate the value of \( \left(1.01\right)^{30} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ \left(1.01\right)^{30} \approx 1.347848915 \]

Next, we multiply this value by the principal amount to find the total amount at the end of the period:
\[ A \approx 24000 \times 1.347848915 \approx 32348.37 \]

 rounding the answer to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[ A \approx 32348 \]

The problem involves finding the length of the third side of a triangle, given that the other two sides are 1 unit and 3 units, and the third side is an integer value.

The key constraint here is the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Let's denote the length of the third side as \( x \). According to the Triangle Inequality Theorem, we have the following inequalities:
1. \( x + 1 > 3 \)
2. \( x + 3 > 1 \)
3. \( 1 + 3 > x \)

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$. Since the sum of all but one of the interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$, the sum of all interior angles must be $1070^{\circ}$ plus the measure of the unknown angle. Let's call the measure of the unknown angle $x$. Therefore, we have:
\[
(n-2) \times 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can use this inequality to find the range of possible values for $n$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can express $x$ in terms of $n$:
\[
x = (n-2) \times 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
Since $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the following inequality:
\[
0 < (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
We can split this into two inequalities:
\[
0 < (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
Solving the first inequality:
\[
1070 < (n-2) \times 180
\]
\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]
\[
5.944 < n-2
\]
\[
7.944 < n
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$.

Solving the second inequality:
\[
(n-2) \times 180 < 1250
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.944
\]
\[
n < 8.944
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$.

Combining the two results, we get:
\[
8 \leq n \leq 8
\]
Therefore, the only possible value for $n$ is 8.

[ADVANCE]

According to the Remainder Theorem for polynomials, the remainder of the division of \( f(x) \) by \( x^2 - 1 \) can be found by evaluating \( f(x) \) at the roots of \( x^2 - 1 \), which are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \). We can set up the following equations using the Remainder Theorem:

\[ f(1) = a(1) + b = a + b \]
\[ f(-1) = a(-1) + b = -a + b \]

We need to calculate \( f(1) \) and \( f(-1) \).

[ADVANCE]

First, let's calculate \( f(1) \):

\[ f(1) = 1^{10} + 5 \cdot 1^9 - 8 \cdot 1^8 + 7 \cdot 1^7 - 1^6 - 12 \cdot 1^5 + 4 \cdot 1^4 - 8 \cdot 1^3 + 12 \cdot 1^2 - 5 \cdot 1 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = 1 + 5 - 8 + 7 - 1 - 12 + 4 - 8 + 12 - 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = -11 \]

Next, let's calculate \( f(-1) \):

\[ f(-1) = (-1)^{10} + 5 \cdot (-1)^9 - 8 \cdot (-1)^8 + 7 \cdot (-1)^7 - (-1)^6 - 12 \cdot (-1)^5 + 4 \cdot (-1)^4 - 8 \cdot (-1)^3 + 12 \cdot (-1)^2 - 5 \cdot (-1) - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 17 \]

Now we have the system of equations:

\[ a + b = -11 \]
\[ -a + b = 17 \]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Adding the two equations together, we get:

\[ (a + b) + (-a + b) = -11 + 17 \]
\[ 2b = 6 \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Substituting \( b = 3 \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ a + 3 = -11 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

So, the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \) is \( -14x + 3 \).

The problem involves determining the number of meals required for 12 friends to have just enough food, given that the portions are large enough to feed 18 people.

[ADVANCE]

Since the portions are enough for 18 people, we need to find out how many meals are required to feed 12 people. We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Let's denote the number of meals required for 12 people as \( x \).

The ratio of the number of people to the number of meals is constant. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{18 \text{ people}}{1 \text{ meal}} = \frac{12 \text{ people}}{x \text{ meals}}
\]

Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[
x = \frac{12 \text{ people}}{18 \text{ people}} \times 1 \text{ meal} = \frac{12}{18} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ meals}
\]

Since the number of meals must be a whole number, and we can't order a fraction of a meal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, the problem asks for the number of meals they should have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them, which implies we are looking for the smallest whole number of meals that is greater than or equal to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a meal per person times 12 people.

Given that \(\frac{2}{3}\) is less than 1, the smallest whole number of meals that would be sufficient is 1 meal short of the amount needed for 18 people but still more than the amount needed for 12 people. However, since we are looking for just enough food for 12 people, we should consider the next whole number after \(\frac{2}{3}\) which is 1.

Therefore, the number of meals they should have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them is \(\boxed{8}\).

The problem involves finding the value of $\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}$ for a quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ with integer coefficients, given that $4-\sqrt{11}$ is a root.

Since the polynomial has integer coefficients, the conjugate of $4-\sqrt{11}$, which is $4+\sqrt{11}$, must also be a root of the polynomial.

The quadratic polynomial can be written in the form $p(x) = a(x - (4-\sqrt{11}))(x - (4+\sqrt{11}))$, where $a$ is a constant.

We can simplify the expression for $p(x)$:
\[ p(x) = a(x - 4 + \sqrt{11})(x - 4 - \sqrt{11}) = a((x-4)^2 - (\sqrt{11})^2) = a((x-4)^2 - 11) = a(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11) = a(x^2 - 8x + 5). \]

Since the polynomial has integer coefficients, we can choose $a = 1$ for simplicity, so the polynomial becomes $p(x) = x^2 - 8x + 5$.

Next, we need to compute $p(3)$ and $p(4)$:
\[ p(3) = 3^2 - 8 \cdot 3 + 5 = 9 - 24 + 5 = -10, \]

To do this, we should first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$, or check if $\mathbf{A}$ can be diagonalized, which would simplify the computation of $\mathbf{A}^n$ for large $n$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find $\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}$, we first need to compute the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$. The characteristic polynomial of $\mathbf{A}$ is given by:
\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 7 \\ -1 & -2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) + 7 = \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1.
\]
We solve the characteristic equation $\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 0$ to find the eigenvalues. The solutions are:
\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Let $\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the eigenvalues are complex and conjugates of each other, we can use the fact that $\lambda_1^3 = \lambda_2^3 = 1$ (because $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the non-real cube roots of unity).

Next, we need to find the sum $\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}$. Using the property of the eigenvalues, we have:
\[
\mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A})) = \cdots = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I},
\]
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. Therefore, $\mathbf{A}^{27} = (\mathbf{A}^3)^9 = \mathbf{I}^9 = \mathbf{I}$, $\mathbf{A}^{31} = \mathbf{A}^{30} \mathbf{A} = (\mathbf{A}^3)^{10} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}^{10} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{A}^{39} \mathbf{A} = (\mathbf{A}^3)^{13} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}^{13} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}$.

Thus, we have:
\[
\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} + 2\mathbf{A}.

The problem requires finding a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We start with the congruence equation:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find that \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

Using \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
And using \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we check the solutions. The solution \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) is even, so we discard it. The solution \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \) is equivalent to \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \), but we need an odd solution. We re-evaluate the calculation for \( t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \) and find that it indeed equals \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \), which is \( t = 4 \) or \( t = -19 + 23 = 4 \). However, we need to find the odd solution, so we recheck the calculation.

[ADVANCE]

We recheck the calculation for the odd solution. We have \( t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \), which gives \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \). Converting this to a positive equivalent within the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), we get \( t = 4 \), which is even. We need to find the odd solution, so we re-evaluate the quadratic congruence and its solutions.

Given the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can also try to find the solution by testing odd values of \( t \) between 1 and 22.

By testing odd values, we find that for \( t = 11 \):

The problem involves finding the $x$-intercept, $y$-intercept, and slope of a line given by the equation $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1$. We need to identify the values of $a$, $b$, and $m$ and then compute $a + b + m$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the $x$-intercept $a$, we set $y = 0$ in the equation $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1$ and solve for $x$:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{x}{4} = 1 \implies x = 4.
\]
So, the $x$-intercept $a$ is 4.

To find the $y$-intercept $b$, we set $x = 0$ in the equation $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1$ and solve for $y$:
\[
\frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies y = 12.
\]
So, the $y$-intercept $b$ is 12.

To find the slope $m$, we can rewrite the equation $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1$ in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + c$. First, we multiply the entire equation by 12 to clear the denominators:
\[
3x + y = 12 \implies y = -3x + 12.
\]
From the slope-intercept form, we can see that the slope $m$ is -3.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now that we have the values of $a$, $b$, and $m$, we can compute $a + b + m$:
\[
a + b + m = 4 + 12 + (-3) = 4 + 12 - 3 = 13.

The problem involves arranging six distinguishable cars into three lanes (left-turn, straight-going, and right-turn) such that all three lanes are occupied. The order in which the cars arrive at the intersection matters, and the cars are distinguishable.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of distributing distinguishable objects (cars) into distinguishable bins (lanes) with the condition that no bin is empty. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ways to arrange the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to assign 6 cars to 3 lanes without any restrictions. Since each car has 3 choices of lanes, the total number of ways is $3^6 = 729$.

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways in which at least one lane is empty. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this purpose.

Let's define the following:
- $A$: the set of ways to assign cars such that the left-turn lane is empty.
- $B$: the set of ways to assign cars such that the straight-going lane is empty.
- $C$: the set of ways to assign cars such that the right-turn lane is empty.

The size of each of these sets is $2^6 = 64$, because if one lane is empty, each car has only 2 choices of lanes.

The size of the intersection of any two sets (e.g., $A \cap B$) is $1^6 = 1$, because if two lanes are empty, each car has only 1 choice of lane (the remaining lane).

The size of the intersection of all three sets ($A \cap B \cap C$) is $0$, because it's impossible for all three lanes to be empty.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of ways to assign cars such that at least one lane is empty is:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| = 3 \cdot 64 - 3 \cdot 1 + 0 = 192 - 3 = 189. \]

Therefore, the number of ways to assign cars such that all three lanes are occupied is:
\[ 3^6 - |A \cup B \cup C| = 729 - 189 = 540. \]

The number of ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied is $\boxed{540}$.

The problem asks for the maximum value of the expression $4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ over all real numbers $x$. To find the maximum value, we can use calculus or complete the square. We will use calculus here.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's expand the expression $4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ to make it easier to work with:
\[
4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(2x + 14 - x^2 - 7x) = 4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56.
\]
Now, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(-4x^2 - 20x + 56) = -8x - 20.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[
-8x - 20 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{20}{8} = -\frac{5}{2}.
\]
To determine if this critical point is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of the expression is:
\[
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(-4x^2 - 20x + 56) = -8.
\]
Since the second derivative is negative, the function has a maximum at $x = -\frac{5}{2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the value of the expression at $x = -\frac{5}{2}$:
\[
-4\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - 20\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) + 56 = -4\left(\frac{25}{4}\right) + 50 + 56 = -25 + 50 + 56 = 81.

Since the cookies of the same type are not distinguishable, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6$, where $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ represent the number of chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies selected, respectively.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6$ is a classic example of a ""stars and bars"" problem, where we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 identical items (cookies) into 3 distinct groups (types of cookies). The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n$ is given by $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.

In this case, $n = 6$ (the total number of cookies) and $k = 3$ (the number of types of cookies). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[

The given equation is in polar coordinates, \(r^2 \cos 2 \theta = 4\). To identify the curve, we need to convert this equation to Cartesian coordinates.

We can use the double-angle identity for cosine: \(\cos 2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta\). We also know the relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates: \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), \(x = r \cos \theta\), and \(y = r \sin \theta\).

Substituting \(\cos 2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta\) into the equation, we get:
\[r^2 (\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta) = 4.\]

Using \(r \cos \theta = x\) and \(r \sin \theta = y\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[r^2 \left(\frac{x^2}{r^2} - \frac{y^2}{r^2}\right) = 4,\]
which simplifies to:
\[x^2 - y^2 = 4.\]

This is the equation of a hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates.

\[
\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\div \frac{12}{20} = \frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\cdot \frac{20}{12}

Next, we can simplify the fractions by canceling out common factors:

Let's denote the initial number of blue marbles as \(4x\) and the initial number of yellow marbles as \(3x\), since the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3.

After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the number of blue marbles becomes \(4x + 5\) and the number of yellow marbles becomes \(3x - 3\). The new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3, so we can set up the following equation:

The vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$ is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27

We also need to compute the magnitudes of $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{BC}\| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

The problem asks for the remainder when the sum of the first 10 positive integers is divided by 9. We need to calculate the sum and then find the remainder when this sum is divided by 9.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
For \( n = 10 \), the sum is:
\[ S = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55 \]
Now, we need to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 9.

To find the remainder when 55 is divided by 9, we can perform the division:
\[ 55 \div 9 = 6 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \]
So, the remainder when 55 is divided by 9 is 1.

The problem involves arranging 2 indistinguishable IMO gold medals and 2 indistinguishable IPhO gold medals in one row. We need to find the number of distinct arrangements possible.

[ADVANCE]

Since the IMO gold medals are indistinguishable and the IPhO gold medals are indistinguishable, we can use the concept of permutations of a multiset. The total number of medals is 4, and we need to choose positions for the IMO medals (the remaining positions will be for the IPhO medals).

The number of distinct arrangements can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset: $\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects, and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the frequencies of the indistinguishable objects.

In this case, we have 4 medals in total, with 2 IMO medals and 2 IPhO medals. The number of distinct arrangements is $\frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the value: $\frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{24}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{24}{4} = 6$.

We need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of $997$ modulo $1000$, which is an integer $x$ such that $997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}$. This means we need to find $x$ such that $997x - 1000k = 1$ for some integer $k$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve this.

[ADVANCE]

We start by applying the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $997$ and $1000$:

\[
1000 = 997 \cdot 1 + 3
\]
\[
997 = 3 \cdot 332 + 1
\]
\[
3 = 1 \cdot 3 + 0
\]

The gcd is $1$, which means the inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express $1$ as a combination of $997$ and $1000$:

Working backwards from the second last equation:
\[
1 = 997 - 3 \cdot 332
\]
Substituting $3 = 1000 - 997$ from the first equation:
\[
1 = 997 - (1000 - 997) \cdot 332
\]
\[
1 = 997 - 1000 \cdot 332 + 997 \cdot 332
\]
\[
1 = 997 \cdot 333 - 1000 \cdot 332
\]

This shows that $997 \cdot 333 \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}$. Therefore, the modular multiplicative inverse of $997$ modulo $1000$ is $333$.

The problem requires converting the repeating decimal $0.\overline{1331}$ into a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1. Then, we need to find the sum $a+b$.

[ADVANCE]

Let $x = 0.\overline{1331}$. To eliminate the repeating part, we multiply $x$ by $10000$ (since the repeating block has 4 digits):
\[10000x = 1331.\overline{1331}.\]
Now, we subtract the original $x$ from this equation:
\[10000x - x = 1331.\overline{1331} - 0.\overline{1331}.\]
This simplifies to:
\[9999x = 1331.\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[x = \frac{1331}{9999}.\]
Next, we need to simplify the fraction $\frac{1331}{9999}$ by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1331 and 9999.

[ADVANCE]

To find the GCD of 1331 and 9999, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. First, we divide 9999 by 1331:
\[9999 = 1331 \times 7 + 882.\]
Next, we divide 1331 by 882:
\[1331 = 882 \times 1 + 449.\]
Then, we divide 882 by 449:
\[882 = 449 \times 1 + 433.\]
Next, we divide 449 by 433:
\[449 = 433 \times 1 + 16.\]
Then, we divide 433 by 16:
\[433 = 16 \times 27 + 1.\]
Finally, we divide 16 by 1:
\[16 = 1 \times 16 + 0.\]
The GCD of 1331 and 9999 is 11. We can now simplify the fraction $\frac{1331}{9999}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 11:
\[\frac{1331}{9999} = \frac{1331 \div 11}{9999 \div 11} = \frac{121}{909}.\]
The fraction $\frac{121}{909}$ is in its simplest form, so $a = 121$ and $b = 909$.

The sum $a+b$ is:
\[a + b = 121 + 909 = 1030.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The set $S$ essentially forms a larger region around the regular nonagon, where the perimeter of $S$ is the sum of the lengths of the outer boundary of this region. Since the set $S$ includes all points less than $1$ unit away from the perimeter of the nonagon, the outer boundary of $S$ is a larger regular nonagon with each side length increased by $2$ units (1 unit on each side).

The perimeter of a regular nonagon is the sum of the lengths of its 9 sides. If the original nonagon has a side length of 2 units, the new nonagon formed by the outer boundary of $S$ will have a side length of $2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 4$ units.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The perimeter of the new regular nonagon (which is the perimeter of $S$) can be calculated by multiplying the side length of the new nonagon by the number of sides. Since a nonagon has 9 sides, the perimeter of $S$ is $9 \cdot 4 = 36$ units.

The problem asks for the number of real values of $x$ for which $\sqrt{120-\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer. This means that the expression inside the square root, $120-\sqrt{x}$, must be a perfect square, and it must be non-negative because it's under a square root.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the integer value of $\sqrt{120-\sqrt{x}}$ as $n$. Then, we have:
\[
\sqrt{120-\sqrt{x}} = n
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
120 - \sqrt{x} = n^2
\]
Rearranging the equation to solve for $\sqrt{x}$, we have:
\[
\sqrt{x} = 120 - n^2
\]
Since $\sqrt{x}$ must be non-negative, we require:
\[
120 - n^2 \geq 0
\]
This implies:
\[
n^2 \leq 120
\]
The largest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality is 10, since $10^2 = 100$ and $11^2 = 121$. The smallest possible value of $n$ is 0, since $n$ is a non-negative integer. Therefore, $n$ can take any integer value from 0 to 10, inclusive.

[ADVANCE]

For each value of $n$ from 0 to 10, we can find a corresponding value of $x$:
\[
\sqrt{x} = 120 - n^2
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x = (120 - n^2)^2
\]
Since $n$ can take 11 different values (0, 1, 2, ..., 10), there are 11 corresponding real values of $x$.

To convert the binary number 11111111 to base 10, we can use the positional value of each digit in the binary number. The rightmost digit represents \(2^0\), the next digit to the left represents \(2^1\), and so on, up to the leftmost digit which represents \(2^7\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the areas of the regions $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z,$ we need to calculate the areas of the annular regions formed by the concentric circles. The area of a circle is given by the formula $\pi r^2,$ where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

The area of the region with radius $4$ is $\pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi.$ The area of the region with radius $6$ is $\pi \cdot 6^2 = 36\pi.$ The area of the region with radius $7$ is $\pi \cdot 7^2 = 49\pi.$

The area of region $X$ is the area of the smallest circle, which is $16\pi.$ The area of region $Y$ is the area of the circle with radius $6$ minus the area of the circle with radius $4$, which is $36\pi - 16\pi = 20\pi.$ The area of region $Z$ is the area of the largest circle minus the area of the circle with radius $6$, which is $49\pi - 36\pi = 13\pi.$

Now, we can compare the areas of the regions: $X = 16\pi,$ $Y = 20\pi,$ and $Z = 13\pi.$ The region with the greatest area is $Y$ with $20\pi,$ and the region with the smallest area is $Z$ with $13\pi.$

Since $a$ and $b$ are different prime numbers greater than 2, the prime factorization of $2ab$ is $2^1 \cdot a^1 \cdot b^1$.

[ADVANCE]

The number of whole-number divisors of a number can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying the results. For the prime factorization $2^1 \cdot a^1 \cdot b^1$, the number of divisors is:

Thus, \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the equation holds for all \(x \neq 0\) is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

However, we can see that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) simplifies to \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is not possible.

Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\). However, we need to be careful with the domain and range of the inverse trigonometric functions.

Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then, \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:
\[\sin \left( \theta + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This simplifies to:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:
\[1 = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This is a contradiction, which means the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) has no solution.

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $c$ for a polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3 - 2ax^2 + (a^2 - 81)x - c$ with roots that are all positive integers. We need to use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to its roots.

[ADVANCE]

Let the roots of the polynomial be $r$, $s$, and $t$. By Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[
r + s + t = a,
\]
\[
rs + rt + st = \frac{a^2 - 81}{2},
\]
\[
rst = \frac{c}{2}.
\]
From the first equation, we see that $a$ is the sum of three positive integers, so $a \geq 3$. We also know that $a$ is a positive integer.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $a^2 - 81$ in terms of the roots as follows:
\[
a^2 - 81 = 2(rs + rt + st).
\]
Substituting $a = r + s + t$ into the equation, we get:
\[
(r + s + t)^2 - 81 = 2(rs + rt + st).
\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[
r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + 2(rs + rt + st) - 81 = 2(rs + rt + st).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 81.
\]
We need to find all sets of positive integers $(r, s, t)$ that satisfy this equation.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by finding the possible values for $r$, $s$, and $t$. Since $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 81$, we can assume without loss of generality that $r \leq s \leq t$. We can check the possible values for $r$, $s$, and $t$ by trial and error.

If $r = 1$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 80$. The possible pairs $(s, t)$ are $(4, 8)$, since $4^2 + 8^2 = 16 + 64 = 80$.

If $r = 2$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 77$. There are no integer solutions for $s$ and $t$.

If $r = 3$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 72$. The possible pairs $(s, t)$ are $(6, 6)$, since $6^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 36 = 72$.

If $r = 4$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 65$. There are no integer solutions for $s$ and $t$.

If $r = 5$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 56$. There are no integer solutions for $s$ and $t$.

If $r = 6$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 45$. The possible pairs $(s, t)$ are $(3, 6)$, but this is the same as the case $(3, 6, 6)$.

If $r = 7$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 32$. There are no integer solutions for $s$ and $t$.

If $r = 8$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 17$. There are no integer solutions for $s$ and $t$.

If $r = 9$, then $s^2 + t^2 = 0$. This is not possible since $s$ and $t$ are positive integers.

So, the possible sets of roots are $(1, 4, 8)$ and $(3, 6, 6)$.

[ADVANCE]

For the roots $(1, 4, 8)$, we have:
\[
a = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13,
\]
\[
c = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 64.
\]
For the roots $(3, 6, 6)$, we have:
\[
a = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15,
\]
\[
c = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 216.
\]
Since Jon says that there are still two possible values of $c$ after knowing the value of $a$, the value of $a$ Steve wrote must be 13 or 15. For $a = 13$, the value of $c$ is 64, and for $a = 15$, the value of $c$ is 216.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the two possible values of $c$ is:
\[
64 + 216 = 280.

The problem asks us to find the sum of $\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}$ over all triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which there exist triangles with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c.$ This means we need to consider the triangle inequality conditions for $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with sides $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ the following must hold: $a + b > c,$ $a + c > b,$ and $b + c > a.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To compute the sum $\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}$, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the triangle inequality. We can rewrite the sum as a triple sum over all positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ that satisfy the triangle inequality:
\[
\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a},
\]
where $\mathbf{1}_{\text{condition}}$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise.

We can simplify the problem by considering the possible orders of $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ Without loss of generality, we can assume $a \leq b \leq c.$ The triangle inequality then reduces to $a + b > c.$ We can now rewrite the sum as:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{a+b-1} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.
\]
However, we also need to consider the cases where $b \leq a \leq c,$ $c \leq a \leq b,$ and other permutations. To avoid overcounting, we can use the symmetry of the problem and multiply the sum by 6 (since there are 6 permutations of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can now focus on computing the sum for the case $a \leq b \leq c$ and then multiply the result by 6. The sum becomes:
\[
6 \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \sum_{c=a}^{a+b-1} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.
\]
We can first sum over $c$:
\[
\sum_{c=a}^{a+b-1} \frac{1}{5^c} = \frac{1}{5^a} \sum_{c=0}^{b-1} \frac{1}{5^c} = \frac{1}{5^a} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b}{1 - \frac{1}{5}} = \frac{1}{5^a} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b}{5^a}.
\]
Substituting this back into the sum, we get:
\[
6 \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b}{5^a} = \frac{15}{2} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^a} \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b\right).

We can split the sum into two parts:
\[
\frac{15}{2} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^a} - \frac{15}{2} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^a} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^b.
\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[
\frac{15}{2} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{5^a} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^b - \frac{15}{2} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{5^a} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{15}\right)^b.

We can now compute the inner sums:
\[
\sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^b = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^a \sum_{b=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^b = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^a \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^a \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{a-1},

Substituting these back into the sum, we get:
\[

Simplifying further, we get:

Substituting these back into the sum, we get:

The problem involves finding the time it takes for two gears to align their marks due north again. We are given the rates at which the gears turn: the first gear turns $33\frac{1}{3}$ times per minute, and the second gear turns 45 times per minute. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each gear to complete one full rotation to determine when they will both be pointing due north again.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, let's convert the mixed number $33\frac{1}{3}$ to an improper fraction: $33\frac{1}{3} = \frac{100}{3}$. This means the first gear turns $\frac{100}{3}$ times per minute, and the second gear turns 45 times per minute.

To find the time for one full rotation, we take the reciprocal of the number of rotations per minute. For the first gear, the time for one full rotation is $\frac{3}{100}$ minutes per rotation, and for the second gear, it is $\frac{1}{45}$ minutes per rotation.

To find the time when both gears will next have their marks pointing due north, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $\frac{3}{100}$ and $\frac{1}{45}$ in terms of minutes. To do this, we first find the LCM of the numerators (3 and 1) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators (100 and 45).

The LCM of 3 and 1 is 3, and the GCD of 100 and 45 is 5. The LCM of $\frac{3}{100}$ and $\frac{1}{45}$ is $\frac{\text{LCM of numerators}}{\text{GCD of denominators}} = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{1} = \frac{3}{5}$ minutes.

Since we need the answer in seconds, we convert $\frac{3}{5}$ minutes to seconds: $\frac{3}{5} \times 60 = 36$ seconds.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the time when two gears, turning at different rates, will next have their marks pointing due north.

The direction vectors are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which are parallel since one is a scalar multiple of the other. The points on the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The formula involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line, and then taking the magnitude of the result.

First, we need to find the vector connecting a point on each line. Let's call this vector \(\mathbf{PQ}\), where \(P = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(Q = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). So,
\[
\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the cross product of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The cross product \(\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

We also need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

The distance \(D\) between the two parallel lines is given by:
\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value, we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality, which states that for any set of positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\),
\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n}}.
\]
Rearranging the AM-HM inequality, we get
\[
(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n) \left( \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n} \right) \geq n^2.
\]
In our case, \(n = 4\), so the inequality becomes
\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) \geq 4^2 = 16.
\]
This inequality suggests that the minimum value of the expression is 16.

[VERIFY]

The AM-HM inequality is a well-established result in mathematics, and its application to the given problem seems correct. The inequality is satisfied with equality when all the terms are equal, i.e., when \(a = b = c = d\). This means that the minimum value of the expression is indeed achieved when \(a = b = c = d\).

Since the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), and we have found a condition under which the equality holds, we can conclude that the minimum value of the expression is 16.

[OUTPUT]

The minimum value of the expression \((a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right)\) is \(\boxed{16}\).

The problem involves solving an equation with a rational expression. The goal is to find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} = 4r-3\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(2r-7\), assuming \(2r-7 \neq 0\), which means \(r \neq \frac{7}{2}\).

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} \cdot (2r-7) = (4r-3) \cdot (2r-7)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r-3)(2r-7)
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side further:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

Now, we move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0
\]

We can multiply the entire equation by -1 to simplify:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0\) by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(2 \cdot 28 = 56\) and add to \(-15\). These numbers are \(-8\) and \(-7\).

So, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = (2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r - 4 = 0
\]

Solving for \(r\):

\[
r = \frac{7}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4
\]

However, we must remember that \(r \neq \frac{7}{2}\) because it would make the original denominator zero. Therefore, the only valid solution is:

\[
r = 4

The $x$-coordinates of the vertices range from $-5$ to $5$, and the $y$-coordinates range from $-4$ to $4$.

\[x_6 = x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211\]

Next, we calculate \(x_7\):
\[x_7 = x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375\]

Next, we calculate \(x_8\):
\[x_8 = x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420\]

Next, we calculate \(x_9\):
\[x_9 = x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523\]

Next, we calculate \(x_{10}\):
\[x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267\]

We observe that \(x_{10} = -x_5\), \(x_9 = -x_4\), \(x_8 = -x_3\), \(x_7 = -x_2\), and \(x_6 = -x_1\). This suggests a periodic pattern in the sequence with a period of 12, as \(x_{11} = x_1\), \(x_{12} = x_2\), and so on.

To confirm, we can calculate a few more terms to ensure the pattern holds. However, based on the calculations, it appears that the sequence repeats every 12 terms.

Next, we need to find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using this periodicity.

Since the sequence has a period of 12, we can reduce the indices modulo 12:
\[531 \mod 12 = 3\]
\[753 \mod 12 = 9\]
\[975 \mod 12 = 3\]

Thus, \(x_{531} = x_3 = 420\), \(x_{753} = x_9 = -523\), and \(x_{975} = x_3 = 420\).

Finally, we calculate the sum:
\[x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 - 523 + 420 = 317\]

The problem involves finding the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) in a sequence defined by a recursive formula. By calculating the first few terms, we identified a periodic pattern with a period of 12. Using this periodicity, we reduced the indices modulo 12 and found the corresponding terms in the sequence. Finally, we calculated the sum of the required terms.

The problem involves solving two inequalities and finding the values of $p$ that satisfy both of them. The inequalities are $0 \ge 54p - 144$ and $0 > 12 - 20p$. We need to solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of their solution sets.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
[ADVANCE]
First, let's solve the inequality $0 \ge 54p - 144$:
\[
0 \ge 54p - 144 \implies 144 \ge 54p \implies p \le \frac{144}{54} \implies p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]
So, the solution to the first inequality is $p \in \left(-\infty, \frac{8}{3}\right]$.

Next, let's solve the inequality $0 > 12 - 20p$:
\[
0 > 12 - 20p \implies 20p > 12 \implies p > \frac{12}{20} \implies p > \frac{3}{5}

[/ADVANCE]
Let's denote the three consecutive positive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The sum of these integers is \((n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n\). Since the sum is a three-digit palindrome and is less than 220, we can express the sum as a three-digit palindrome \(abc\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits, and \(a = c\). The possible values for the sum are 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, and 191.

The problem involves finding the solutions to the equation $z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0$ and determining the area of the convex polygon formed by these solutions in the complex plane.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve the equation, we can try to factor it or find a pattern. Notice that the equation resembles the expansion of $(z + i)^4$, but with a constant term difference. Let's rewrite the equation and see if we can factor it:

\[z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = (z + i)^4 - 2i = 0.\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[(z + i)^4 = 2i.\]

We can express $2i$ in polar form as $2e^{i\pi/2}$. Then, we take the fourth root of both sides:

\[z + i = \sqrt[4]{2}e^{i(\pi/8 + k\pi/2)}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\]

This gives us the four solutions for $z$:

\[z = \sqrt[4]{2}e^{i(\pi/8 + k\pi/2)} - i, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\]

Next, we need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by these solutions. The solutions are the vertices of a square in the complex plane, since the arguments of the fourth roots are evenly spaced by $\pi/2$.

The distance from the origin to each vertex is $\sqrt[4]{2}$, and the distance from each vertex to the center (which is $-i$) is $\sqrt{(\sqrt[4]{2})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2} + 1}$.

However, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the solutions form a square with side length $\sqrt[4]{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = \sqrt[4]{8}$.

The area of the square is then:

\[\text{Area} = \left(\sqrt[4]{8}\right)^2 = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{3}{2}}.\]

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The area of the polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a/b}$, where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. Here, the area is $2^{3/2}$, so $a = 3$, $b = 2$, and $p = 2$. Therefore, $a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7$.

We need to compare the solutions of five different equations to determine which one has the largest solution for $x$. The equations are given as:

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3(1 + r)^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3(1 + 2r)^x = 7$ $\textbf{(D)}\ 3(1 + \sqrt {r})^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 3(1 + 1/r)^x = 7$

Given the constraint $0 < r < 3$, we need to isolate $x$ in each equation and compare the resulting expressions.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can isolate $x$ in each equation by dividing both sides by 3 and then taking the logarithm of both sides. This will allow us to express $x$ in terms of $r$.

For equation $\textbf{(A)}$:
\[ (1 + r)^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x = \log_{1+r} \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \]

For equation $\textbf{(B)}$:
\[ (1 + r/10)^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x = \log_{1+r/10} \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \]

For equation $\textbf{(C)}$:
\[ (1 + 2r)^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x = \log_{1+2r} \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \]

For equation $\textbf{(D)}$:
\[ (1 + \sqrt{r})^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x = \log_{1+\sqrt{r}} \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \]

For equation $\textbf{(E)}$:
\[ (1 + 1/r)^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x = \log_{1+1/r} \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \]

Next, we need to compare the values of $x$ for each equation. Since the base of the logarithm is different in each equation, we can use the change of base formula to express each logarithm in terms of a common base, such as the natural logarithm.

The change of base formula is:
\[ \log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a} \]

Applying this formula to each equation, we get:
\[ x_{\textbf{(A)}} = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\ln (1 + r)} \]
\[ x_{\textbf{(B)}} = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\ln (1 + r/10)} \]
\[ x_{\textbf{(C)}} = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\ln (1 + 2r)} \]
\[ x_{\textbf{(D)}} = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\ln (1 + \sqrt{r})} \]
\[ x_{\textbf{(E)}} = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\ln (1 + 1/r)} \]

Since $\ln \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)$ is a constant for all equations, the value of $x$ depends on the denominator, which is the natural logarithm of the base.

Next, we need to compare the values of the denominators. The smaller the denominator, the larger the value of $x$.

We know that the natural logarithm function $\ln x$ is an increasing function, so we need to compare the values of the bases:

- For equation $\textbf{(A)}$, the base is $1 + r$
- For equation $\textbf{(B)}$, the base is $1 + r/10$
- For equation $\textbf{(C)}$, the base is $1 + 2r$
- For equation $\textbf{(D)}$, the base is $1 + \sqrt{r}$
- For equation $\textbf{(E)}$, the base is $1 + 1/r$

Given the constraint $0 < r < 3$, we can analyze the relative sizes of these bases:

- $1 + r/10 < 1 + r < 1 + \sqrt{r} < 1 + 2r < 1 + 1/r$ (since $r/10 < r < \sqrt{r} < 2r < 1/r$ for $0 < r < 3$)

Therefore, the smallest denominator is $\ln (1 + r/10)$, which corresponds to equation $\textbf{(B)}$.

Thus, the equation with the largest solution $x$ is $\textbf{(B)}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$

The problem involves finding the smallest possible number of leaves in a book, given that the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7 and the number of leaves is greater than 100. We know that the number of pages is twice the number of leaves.

Let's denote the number of leaves as \( n \). Then, the number of pages is \( 2n \). According to the problem, the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2n \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

We also know that the number of leaves is greater than 100, so:
\[ n > 100 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve the congruence equation \( 2n \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7 is a number \( x \) such that:
\[ 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

By testing values, we find that \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation, since:
\[ 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now, we can multiply both sides of the original congruence equation \( 2n \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \) by 4 to solve for \( n \):
\[ n \equiv 4 \cdot 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n \equiv 12 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

This means that \( n \) can be written in the form:
\[ n = 7k + 5 \]
for some integer \( k \). Since the number of leaves is greater than 100, we have:
\[ 7k + 5 > 100 \]
\[ 7k > 95 \]
\[ k > \frac{95}{7} \]
\[ k > 13.57 \]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value of \( k \) is 14. Substituting \( k = 14 \) into the equation for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = 7 \cdot 14 + 5 \]
\[ n = 98 + 5 \]
\[ n = 103 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}),

\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),

\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
Substituting the given values, we have:

Since we are looking for integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we need to exclude the boundary points.

Each pair of distinct circles can intersect at最多2 points. To find the maximum number of intersection points, we need to calculate the number of pairs of circles and then multiply by 2 (since each pair can intersect at 2 points).

The number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 4 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of circles and $k$ is the number of circles to choose at a time. Here, $n = 4$ and $k = 2$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. However, in this case, we need to focus on the properties of the trapezoid and the right triangle $\triangle ACD$.

Let's denote the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $a$, the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $b$, the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$, and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $c$. Since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot h = 42$. We need to find the relationship between the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of the trapezoid and $\triangle ACD$, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$. We also know that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot b$. The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c + \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot b = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (b + c) = 42$.

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ is equal to the ratio of their bases $CD$ and $BC$, which is $\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{c}{b}$.

Also, since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, the height of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ is the same, which is $h$. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot b} = \frac{c}{b}$.

Let $[\triangle ACD] = x$, then $[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{c} \cdot x$. The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $x + \frac{b}{c} \cdot x = x \left(1 + \frac{b}{c}\right) = x \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = 42$.

Since $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (b + c) = 42$, we have $x \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (b + c) \cdot \frac{1}{b + c} \cdot c = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c \cdot \frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \cdot \frac{c}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \cdot \frac{c}{b + c} \cdot 1 = 42 \cdot \frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]}$.

We can simplify this to $x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 14 \cdot \frac{c}{b + c} \cdot (b + c) = 14$.

Therefore, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\boxed{14}$.

The problem asks for the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\). To find the minimum value, we can use calculus, specifically the first and second derivative tests, or we can simplify the expression and use inequalities.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's simplify the given expression:
\[
\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1} = \frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1}
\]
We can perform polynomial long division or rewrite the numerator to simplify the expression:
\[
x^2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 1)(x + 6) + 4
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{(x + 1)(x + 6) + 4}{x + 1} = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}
\]
Now, we need to find the minimum value of \(x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:
\[
f(x) = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}
\]
\[
f'(x) = 1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}
\]
Set the derivative equal to zero:
\[
1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 1
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 = 4
\]
\[
x + 1 = \pm 2
\]
Since \(x > 0\), we only consider the positive root:
\[
x + 1 = 2 \implies x = 1
\]
Now, we need to verify that this critical point corresponds to a minimum. We can use the second derivative test:
\[
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left(1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}\right) = \frac{8}{(x + 1)^3}
\]
Evaluate the second derivative at \(x = 1\):
\[
f''(1) = \frac{8}{(1 + 1)^3} = \frac{8}{8} = 1 > 0
\]
Since the second derivative is positive, \(x = 1\) corresponds to a local minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the expression by substituting \(x = 1\) into the expression:
\[
f(1) = 1 + 6 + \frac{4}{1 + 1} = 1 + 6 + \frac{4}{2} = 1 + 6 + 2 = 9

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is \(\boxed{9}\).

The problem involves solving an equation with a square root to find the value of \(x\). The equation is \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by eliminating the square roots by cross-multiplying and then squaring both sides of the equation.

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2} \implies 2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]

Next, we square both sides of the equation to remove the square roots:

\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2 \implies 4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1) \implies 8x = 27x - 9
\]

Now, we can solve for \(x\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

\[
8x - 27x = -9 \implies -19x = -9 \implies x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next, we need to verify that the solution satisfies the original equation, ensuring that the values inside the square roots are non-negative and the denominator is not zero.

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to check that the solution \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation and that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative.

First, we check the expression inside the square root in the denominator:

\[
3x - 1 = 3 \left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]

Since \(3x - 1 > 0\), the expression inside the square root in the denominator is positive.

Next, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \left(\frac{9}{19}\right)}}{\sqrt{3 \left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

The solution \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation.

The problem asks for the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ by $c$ and $c^2 - 2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is equal to $-a$ and the product of the roots is equal to $b$. Therefore, we have:
\[ c + (c^2 - 2) = -a \]
\[ c(c^2 - 2) = b \]

We can express $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$:
\[ a = -c^2 - c + 2 \]
\[ b = c^3 - 2c \]

Since $c$ and $c^2 - 2$ are roots of the equation, the quadratic equation can be written as:
\[ (x - c)(x - (c^2 - 2)) = x^2 - (c + c^2 - 2)x + c(c^2 - 2) \]
Comparing coefficients with the original quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$, we get:
\[ a = -(c + c^2 - 2) \]
\[ b = c(c^2 - 2) \]

We need to find the values of $c$ such that the roots $c$ and $c^2 - 2$ are consistent with the quadratic equation. This means that if we substitute $c^2 - 2$ into the equation, we should get zero:
\[ (c^2 - 2)^2 + a(c^2 - 2) + b = 0 \]
Substituting $a = -c^2 - c + 2$ and $b = c^3 - 2c$ into the equation, we get:
\[ (c^2 - 2)^2 + (-c^2 - c + 2)(c^2 - 2) + c^3 - 2c = 0 \]
Expanding and simplifying the equation will help us find the possible values of $c$.

[ADVANCE]

Expanding the equation:
\[ (c^2 - 2)^2 + (-c^2 - c + 2)(c^2 - 2) + c^3 - 2c = 0 \]
\[ c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 - c^4 + 2c^2 - c^3 + 2c + 2c^2 - 4 + c^3 - 2c = 0 \]
\[ c^4 - c^4 - c^3 + c^3 + 2c^2 - 4c^2 + 2c^2 + 2c - 2c + 4 - 4 = 0 \]
\[ 0 = 0 \]
This equation is an identity, which means it is true for all values of $c$. However, we need to consider the distinct quadratic equations, so we need to find the distinct values of $c$ that lead to different quadratic equations.

[ADVANCE]

We also need to consider the case when the roots are repeated, i.e., $c = c^2 - 2$. Solving this equation:
\[ c = c^2 - 2 \]
\[ c^2 - c - 2 = 0 \]
\[ (c - 2)(c + 1) = 0 \]
So, $c = 2$ or $c = -1$.

For $c = 2$, the roots are $2$ and $2^2 - 2 = 2$, which means the quadratic equation is:
\[ (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]
So, $a = -4$ and $b = 4$.

For $c = -1$, the roots are $-1$ and $(-1)^2 - 2 = -1$, which means the quadratic equation is:
\[ (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \]
So, $a = 2$ and $b = 1$.

We also need to consider the case when $c$ and $c^2 - 2$ are distinct. In this case, we can have different values of $c$ that lead to different quadratic equations. However, we need to check if there are any other distinct values of $c$ that satisfy the condition.

[ADVANCE]

We can also consider the case when $c$ and $c^2 - 2$ are distinct and not equal to 2 or -1. In this case, we can have a quadratic equation with two distinct roots. However, we need to check if there are any other distinct values of $c$ that satisfy the condition.

After re-evaluating the problem, we can conclude that the distinct quadratic equations are those corresponding to the values of $c$ that we have found, which are $c = 2$ and $c = -1$. Additionally, we need to consider the possibility of other values of $c$ that might lead to the same quadratic equation.

[ADVANCE]

1. First, we need to find the range of \( \sin x \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \). The sine function varies from 0 to 1 in this interval, so \( 0 < \sin x \leq 1 \).

2. Next, we consider the expression \( \sqrt{\sin x} \). Since \( 0 < \sin x \leq 1 \), taking the square root will give us \( 0 < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq 1 \).

3. Now, we need to find the range of \( \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \). The logarithm function \( \log_2 \) is defined for positive real numbers, and it is a increasing function. When \( \sqrt{\sin x} \) approaches 0 from the right, \( \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) approaches \(-\infty\). When \( \sqrt{\sin x} = 1 \), \( \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) = \log_2 1 = 0 \).

4. Therefore, the range of \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) is all values from \(-\infty\) to 0, inclusive of 0.

The range of the function is \( (-\infty, 0] \).

The problem involves finding the surface area of one of the pieces created by a plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them in a regular tetrahedron $ABCD$ with side length 2.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the regular tetrahedron and the plane that cuts it. A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces, and each edge has a length of 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them will intersect the tetrahedron in such a way that it creates a smaller tetrahedron and a frustum (a truncated tetrahedron).

The plane cuts each of the four faces of the tetrahedron, creating a smaller equilateral triangle parallel to the base $ABC$ and a trapezoid on the face $ACD$ and $ABD$. The smaller tetrahedron formed will have edge length 1 (since the plane is halfway between the edges $AB$ and $CD$).

The surface area of the piece we are interested in will be the sum of the areas of the three trapezoidal faces and the area of the new equilateral triangular face created by the plane.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. For the original tetrahedron with side length 2, the area of each face is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 2^2 = \sqrt{3}$.

The smaller tetrahedron formed by the plane has an edge length of 1, so the area of each of its faces is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 1^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$.

The area of the new equilateral triangular face created by the plane (which is the base of the frustum) also has an edge length of 1, so its area is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$.

Each of the three trapezoidal faces of the frustum is formed by removing a small equilateral triangle from a larger equilateral triangle. The area of each trapezoid is the area of the corresponding face of the original tetrahedron minus the area of the corresponding face of the smaller tetrahedron. Therefore, the area of each trapezoid is $\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}$.

The total surface area of the piece is the sum of the areas of the three trapezoidal faces and the area of the new equilateral triangular face: $3 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 84. The prime factorization of 84 is:
\[ 84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \]

To minimize the sum, we should try to use the smallest possible distinct integers. We can start by combining the prime factors in a way that gives us distinct integers.

[ADVANCE]

We can start with the smallest prime factor, which is 2. Since we have \(2^2\), we can use 2 and 2 as two of the integers, but we need distinct integers, so we will use 2 and 4 (which is \(2^2\)) is not optimal because we can use 2 and 6 (which is \(2 \times 3\)) instead of 2 and 2 and 3, this will help us to use distinct integers and minimize the sum.

So, the set of distinct integers can be {2, 3, 7} or {2, 6, 7} or {3, 4, 7} or {4, 3, 7} but we need to check which one gives the minimum sum.

Let's calculate the sum for each set:
- For {2, 3, 7}, the sum is \(2 + 3 + 7 = 12\).
- For {2, 6, 7}, the sum is \(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\).
- For {3, 4, 7}, the sum is \(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\).
- For {4, 3, 7}, it is the same as {3, 4, 7} which is 14.

Given that \(a < b < 2009\), we can write \(b = ar\) and \(ar^2 = 2009\). Since \(r\) is an integer, we need to find the integer factors of \(2009\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the prime factorization of \(2009\). The prime factorization of \(2009\) is \(2009 = 41 \times 49 = 41 \times 7^2\). This tells us that the possible values for \(r\) are the integer factors of \(2009\), which are \(1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009\). However, since \(a < b < 2009\) and \(r\) is an integer greater than 1, we can exclude \(r = 1\).

We will check each possible value of \(r\) to see if it yields a valid solution for \(a\).

1. If \(r = 7\), then \(ar^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 7^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 49 = 2009 \implies a = \frac{2009}{49} = 41\). This is a valid solution since \(a = 41 < b = 41 \cdot 7 = 287 < 2009\) is not true, but \(a = 41 < b = 287 < 2009\) is true.
2. If \(r = 41\), then \(ar^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 41^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 1681 = 2009 \implies a = \frac{2009}{1681} = \frac{2009}{41^2}\), which is not an integer.
3. If \(r = 49\), then \(ar^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 49^2 = 2009 \implies a \cdot 2401 = 2009 \implies a = \frac{2009}{2401}\), which is not an integer.

By comparing the coefficients of the expanded form with the original expression $10x^2 - x - 24$, we can set up the following equations:
\[
AB = 10

\[
3A - 8B = -1

We need to solve these equations to find the values of $A$ and $B$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can start by finding the pairs of integers $(A, B)$ that satisfy the equation $AB = 10$. The possible pairs are: $(1, 10)$, $(10, 1)$, $(-1, -10)$, $(-10, -1)$, $(2, 5)$, $(5, 2)$, $(-2, -5)$, and $(-5, -2)$.

Next, we can substitute these pairs into the equation $3A - 8B = -1$ to find the correct values of $A$ and $B$.

Let's try the pair $(A, B) = (2, 5)$:
\[
3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34 \neq -1
\]
This pair does not satisfy the equation.

Next, let's try the pair $(A, B) = (5, 2)$:
\[
3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1
\]
This pair satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the values of $A$ and $B$ are $A = 5$ and $B = 2$.

The problem asks for the degree of the polynomial
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]
We need to determine the degree of this polynomial by analyzing its structure.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the degree of the polynomial \(p(x)\), we can start by simplifying the expression. Notice that the denominators of each term are constants, and the numerators are quadratic expressions in \(x\). Let's rewrite the polynomial as:
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]
We can observe that the polynomial \(p(x)\) is a sum of three rational functions, each with a quadratic numerator and a constant denominator. Since the numerators are quadratic, the degree of each term is 2. However, we need to consider the sum of these terms to determine the overall degree of the polynomial.

Next, let's evaluate \(p(x)\) at specific values of \(x\) to gain more insight. We can evaluate \(p(x)\) at \(x = a\), \(x = b\), and \(x = c\):
\[p(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\]
\[p(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.\]
\[p(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\]
We observe that \(p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1\). This suggests that the polynomial \(p(x) - 1\) has roots at \(x = a\), \(x = b\), and \(x = c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are distinct real numbers, \(p(x) - 1\) is a polynomial of degree 3 with roots at \(x = a\), \(x = b\), and \(x = c\). Therefore, we can write:
\[p(x) - 1 = k(x - a)(x - b)(x - c),\]
where \(k\) is a constant. Since the degree of \(p(x) - 1\) is 3, the degree of \(p(x)\) is also 3, but we need to verify if the leading coefficient of \(p(x)\) is non-zero.

Next, we can determine the value of \(k\) by comparing the coefficients of the highest degree term on both sides of the equation. However, we can also reason that since \(p(x)\) is a sum of rational functions with quadratic numerators and constant denominators, the leading term of \(p(x)\) must be a constant, implying that the degree of \(p(x)\) is actually less than 3.

Let's re-evaluate the polynomial by expanding and combining like terms:
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]
After expanding and combining like terms, we can see that the numerator of the resulting expression is a constant, which implies that the degree of \(p(x)\) is 0.

Therefore, the degree of the polynomial \(p(x)\) is \(\boxed{0}\).

The problem requires us to combine the given expression \[\frac{4+6a}{5}-\frac{1+3a}{4}\] into a single fraction. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions.

[ADVANCE]

The denominators of the two fractions are 5 and 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 4 is 20. We will use this LCM as the common denominator.

We can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:
\[\frac{4+6a}{5} = \frac{(4+6a) \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} = \frac{16 + 24a}{20}\]
\[\frac{1+3a}{4} = \frac{(1+3a) \cdot 5}{4 \cdot 5} = \frac{5 + 15a}{20}\]

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:
\[\frac{16 + 24a}{20} - \frac{5 + 15a}{20} = \frac{(16 + 24a) - (5 + 15a)}{20} = \frac{16 + 24a - 5 - 15a}{20} = \frac{11 + 9a}{20}\]

The equation given is $|x-4| - 10 = 2$.
The objective is to find the product of all possible values of $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
[ADVANCE]
First, isolate the absolute value expression by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[|x-4| - 10 + 10 = 2 + 10\]
\[|x-4| = 12\]
This equation means that the distance between $x$ and 4 is 12. Therefore, we have two possible cases:
\[x-4 = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad x-4 = -12\]
Solving these two equations will give us the possible values of $x$.
For the first case:
\[x-4 = 12\]
\[x = 12 + 4\]
\[x = 16\]
For the second case:
\[x-4 = -12\]
\[x = -12 + 4\]

We are given a diagram with points $R$, $P$, $Q$, and $S$, and we know that $\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}$. We need to find $\cos \angle RPS$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\angle RPS$ is a straight line, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles $\angle RPQ$ and $\angle RPS$ is $180^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle RPS = 180^\circ - \angle RPQ$. We can use the identity $\cos (180^\circ - x) = -\cos x$ to find $\cos \angle RPS$.

We know that $\sin^2 \angle RPQ + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1$. Given that $\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}$, we can find $\cos \angle RPQ$:
\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \sin^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}.
\]
Taking the square root, we get:
\[
\cos \angle RPQ = \pm \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \pm \frac{24}{25}.
\]
Since $\cos \angle RPS = -\cos \angle RPQ$, we have:
\[
\cos \angle RPS = -\left(\pm \frac{24}{25}\right).
\]
However, we need to determine the correct sign. Since $\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}$ is positive, $\angle RPQ$ is in the first or second quadrant, where cosine is positive or negative, respectively. But we are looking for $\cos \angle RPS$, and since $\angle RPS = 180^\circ - \angle RPQ$, the cosine will be the negative of $\cos \angle RPQ$. So, we take the negative value:
\[
\cos \angle RPS = -\frac{24}{25}.

The problem involves finding the length of a hallway that a robot can travel in 90 seconds at a constant speed. We are given that the robot takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer.

First, we need to determine the speed of the robot in meters per second. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters and 2.5 hours is equal to $2.5 \times 3600 = 9000$ seconds.

[ADVANCE]

The speed of the robot is calculated as follows:

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen segments on the circumference of a circle intersect. To approach this, we need to consider the geometric properties and the possible arrangements of the points.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the order in which the points are arranged on the circle determines whether the segments intersect. Specifically, the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged in an alternating manner, i.e., the points are in the order $ACBD$ or $ADBC$ when moving around the circle.

Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, we can fix the position of one point, say $A$, and consider the relative positions of the other three points. The total number of ways to arrange the points $B$, $C$, and $D$ relative to $A$ is $3! = 6$.

Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in intersecting segments: $ACBD$ and $ADBC$. Therefore, the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

The probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:

We are given a monic polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 3, and we need to find $P(5)$ given certain conditions about its remainders when divided by specific quadratic polynomials. We also know that $P(0) = 5$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $P(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 3, we can express it as $P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. We are given that $P(x)$ has remainder $R(x)$ when divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4)$, and remainder $2R(x)$ when divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3)$. This means we can write:
\[ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \]
\[ P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \]
where $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ are polynomials of degree 1. Since $R(x)$ is the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by a quadratic polynomial, $R(x)$ must be a linear polynomial, say $R(x) = mx + n$.

[ADVANCE]

Using the first equation, we have:
\[ P(1) = R(1) = m + n \]
\[ P(4) = R(4) = 4m + n \]
Using the second equation, we have:
\[ P(2) = 2R(2) = 2(2m + n) = 4m + 2n \]
\[ P(3) = 2R(3) = 2(3m + n) = 6m + 2n \]
We also know that $P(0) = 5$, so:
\[ P(0) = c = 5 \]
Thus, the polynomial is $P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can use the values of $P(1)$, $P(4)$, $P(2)$, and $P(3)$ to form a system of equations. We have:
\[ P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6 = m + n \]
\[ P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 16a + 4b + 69 = 4m + n \]
\[ P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 4a + 2b + 13 = 4m + 2n \]
\[ P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 9a + 3b + 32 = 6m + 2n \]
We now have a system of linear equations in terms of $a$, $b$, $m$, and $n$.

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the system of equations step by step. First, we can express $m$ and $n$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ using the first two equations:
\[ m + n = a + b + 6 \]
\[ 4m + n = 16a + 4b + 69 \]
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ 3m = 15a + 3b + 63 \]
\[ m = 5a + b + 21 \]
Substitute $m$ into the first equation:
\[ 5a + b + 21 + n = a + b + 6 \]
\[ n = -4a - 15 \]
Now we have $m$ and $n$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. We can substitute these into the third and fourth equations to get:
\[ 4a + 2b + 13 = 4(5a + b + 21) + 2(-4a - 15) \]
\[ 4a + 2b + 13 = 20a + 4b + 84 - 8a - 30 \]
\[ 4a + 2b + 13 = 12a + 4b + 54 \]
\[ -8a - 2b = 41 \]
\[ 4a + b = -\frac{41}{2} \]
And for the fourth equation:
\[ 9a + 3b + 32 = 6(5a + b + 21) + 2(-4a - 15) \]
\[ 9a + 3b + 32 = 30a + 6b + 126 - 8a - 30 \]
\[ 9a + 3b + 32 = 22a + 6b + 96 \]
\[ -13a - 3b = 64 \]
We now have a system of two linear equations in $a$ and $b$:
\[ 4a + b = -\frac{41}{2} \]
\[ -13a - 3b = 64 \]
We can solve this system to find $a$ and $b$.

[ADVANCE]

Multiply the first equation by 3:
\[ 12a + 3b = -\frac{123}{2} \]
Add this to the second equation:
\[ -13a - 3b + 12a + 3b = 64 - \frac{123}{2} \]
\[ -a = \frac{128 - 123}{2} \]
\[ -a = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ a = -\frac{5}{2} \]
Substitute $a$ into the first equation:
\[ 4\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{41}{2} \]
\[ -10 + b = -\frac{41}{2} \]
\[ b = -\frac{41}{2} + 10 \]
\[ b = -\frac{41}{2} + \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ b = -\frac{21}{2} \]
Now we have $a = -\frac{5}{2}$ and $b = -\frac{21}{2}$. We can find $P(5)$:
\[ P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5 \]
\[ P(5) = 5^3 + \left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)5^2 + \left(-\frac{21}{2}\right)5 + 5 \]
\[ P(5) = 125 - \frac{125}{2} - \frac{105}{2} + 5 \]
\[ P(5) = 125 - \frac{230}{2} + 5 \]

The problem involves analyzing the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for \( x \in [0, \infty) \). We need to determine the distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \).

[ADVANCE]

1. **Evaluate the function at \( x = 0 \):**
   \[
   f(0) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^0 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   So, \( f(0) = 1 \) is a value in the range of \( f(x) \).

2. **Analyze the behavior of the function for \( x > 0 \):**
   For \( x > 0 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) will be a complex number if \( x \) is not an integer, because a negative number raised to a non-integer power is not a real number. However, if \( x \) is a positive even integer, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x \), which is a positive real number. If \( x \) is a positive odd integer, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x = -\left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x \), which is a negative real number.

3. **Determine the range of \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) for \( x > 0 \):**
   Since \( 0 < \frac{5}{8} < 1 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is a decreasing function for \( x > 0 \), and its value ranges from \( 1 \) (at \( x = 0 \)) to \( 0 \) (as \( x \to \infty \)). Therefore, for positive even integers, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) will be a positive real number between \( 0 \) and \( 1 \), and for positive odd integers, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) will be a negative real number between \( -1 \) and \( 0 \).

4. **Determine the floor values for positive even and odd integers:**
   - For positive even integers, \( 0 < \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x < 1 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor = 0 \).
   - For positive odd integers, \( -1 < -\left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^x < 0 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor = -1 \).

5. **Combine the results:**
   The distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) are \( 1 \), \( 0 \), and \( -1 \).

[OUTPUT]

The distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) are \( 1 \), \( 0 \), and \( -1 \). Therefore, the number of distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) is \( 3 \).

The problem requires converting the bicycle's speed from feet per minute to inches per second. We need to use the conversion factors: 1 foot = 12 inches and 1 minute = 60 seconds.

 next action: [ADVANCE]
To convert the speed from feet per minute to inches per second, we can use the following conversion:
\[ \text{Speed in inches per second} = \text{Speed in feet per minute} \times \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ foot}} \times \frac{1 \text{ minute}}{60 \text{ seconds}} \]
Given the speed is 20 feet per minute, we can substitute this value into the equation:

The problem requires forming a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting or directly count the number of valid subcommittees. Here, we will directly count the number of valid subcommittees by considering the different possible combinations of Republicans and Democrats.

The possible distributions of Republicans (R) and Democrats (D) in the subcommittee of 5 members, ensuring at least one member from each party, are:
- 1R and 4D
- 2R and 3D
- 3R and 2D
- 4R and 1D

We will calculate the number of ways for each distribution and sum them up.

[ADVANCE]

1. For 1R and 4D:
\[ \binom{8}{1} \times \binom{6}{4} = 8 \times 15 = 120 \]

2. For 2R and 3D:
\[ \binom{8}{2} \times \binom{6}{3} = 28 \times 20 = 560 \]

3. For 3R and 2D:
\[ \binom{8}{3} \times \binom{6}{2} = 56 \times 15 = 840 \]

4. For 4R and 1D:
\[ \binom{8}{4} \times \binom{6}{1} = 70 \times 6 = 420 \]

[ADVANCE]

The total number of ways to form the subcommittee is the sum of the number of ways for each distribution:
\[ 120 + 560 + 840 + 420 = 1940 \]

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).

The problem requires simplifying the given expression step by step. The expression involves square roots and fractions, so we need to simplify the terms inside the square root first.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We start by simplifying the individual terms inside the expression:
1. Simplify $\sqrt{80}$: $\sqrt{80} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 5} = 4\sqrt{5}$.
2. Simplify $\sqrt{845}$: $\sqrt{845} = \sqrt{169 \cdot 5} = 13\sqrt{5}$.
3. Simplify $\sqrt{45}$: $\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}$.

Now, substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression:
$$\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}}+\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9}+3\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}}}.$$

Next, we simplify the fraction $\dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}}$ by rationalizing the denominator:
$$\dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5\sqrt{5}}{20} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$

Now, the expression becomes:
$$\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}+\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9}+3\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}}}.$$

To add the fractions in the numerator, we need a common denominator, which is 36:
$$\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} = \dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36}, \quad \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} = \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36}, \quad 3\sqrt{5} = \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36}.$$

So, the expression inside the numerator becomes:
$$\dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}.$$

Now, the expression is:
$$\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36\sqrt{5}}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{169}{36}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{169}}{\sqrt{36}} = \dfrac{13}{6}.$$

We are given that $xyz(x + y + z) = 1$ and we need to find the minimum value of $(x + y)(y + z)$ for positive real numbers $x, y, z$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $(x + y)(y + z)$, we can start by expanding the expression:
\[
(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + zx = y(x + y + z) + zx.
\]
Given the constraint $xyz(x + y + z) = 1$, we can express $x + y + z$ as $\frac{1}{xyz}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
(x + y)(y + z) = y \cdot \frac{1}{xyz} + zx = \frac{y}{xyz} + zx = \frac{1}{xz} + zx.
\]
We need to find the minimum value of $\frac{1}{xz} + zx$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $\frac{1}{xz} + zx$, we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$. Applying AM-GM to $\frac{1}{xz} + zx$, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{xz} + zx \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{1}{xz} \cdot zx} = 2\sqrt{1} = 2.
\]
The equality in AM-GM holds when $\frac{1}{xz} = zx$, which implies $xz = 1$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to verify if the equality condition can be satisfied under the given constraint $xyz(x + y + z) = 1$. If $xz = 1$, then $z = \frac{1}{x}$. Substituting $z = \frac{1}{x}$ into the constraint, we get:
\[
xy \cdot \frac{1}{x} \left(x + y + \frac{1}{x}\right) = 1 \implies y \left(x + y + \frac{1}{x}\right) = 1.
\]
We also need to check if the minimum value of $(x + y)(y + z)$ can be achieved for some positive real numbers $x, y, z$.

[SYNTHESIZE]

From the above steps, we have found that the minimum value of $(x + y)(y + z)$ is 2, and we need to ensure that this value can be achieved under the given constraint. We can achieve the minimum value when $xz = 1$ and the equality condition of the AM-GM inequality holds. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x + y)(y + z)$ is indeed 2.

The problem involves expressing the cube root of 2 as a continued fraction. We need to find the value of the positive integer $b$ in the continued fraction representation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing $\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a continued fraction. Let's denote $\sqrt[3]{2}$ by $x$. We can write:
\[ x = a + \frac{1}{b + \frac{1}{c + \frac{1}{d + \dotsb}}} \]
where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers. Since $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is approximately 1.2599, we can see that $a = 1$.

So, we can rewrite $x$ as:
\[ x = 1 + \frac{1}{b + \frac{1}{c + \frac{1}{d + \dotsb}}} \]
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[ x - 1 = \frac{1}{b + \frac{1}{c + \frac{1}{d + \dotsb}}} \]
Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{x-1} = b + \frac{1}{c + \frac{1}{d + \dotsb}} \]
Now, we need to find the value of $\frac{1}{x-1}$. Since $x = \sqrt[3]{2}$, we can substitute this value in:
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \]
To simplify this expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{2 - 1} = \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \]
So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{x-1} = \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \]
Since $\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1$ is approximately 3.2599, we can see that $b = 3$.

We are given a system of linear equations:
1. $a + b = 8$
2. $b + c = -3$
3. $a + c = -5$

We need to find the value of the product $abc$.

[ADVANCE]

To solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can add all three equations together:
$(a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5)$
This simplifies to:
$2a + 2b + 2c = 0$
Dividing through by 2 gives:
$a + b + c = 0$

Now, we can use this equation to express one variable in terms of the others. For example, we can solve for $a$:
$a = -b - c$

We can substitute $a = -b - c$ into the first equation $a + b = 8$:
$-b - c + b = 8$
This simplifies to:
$-c = 8$
So, $c = -8$

Now that we have $c$, we can substitute it into the second equation $b + c = -3$:
$b - 8 = -3$
Solving for $b$ gives:
$b = 5$

Finally, we can substitute $b = 5$ into the first equation $a + b = 8$:
$a + 5 = 8$
Solving for $a$ gives:
$a = 3$

The problem asks for the remainder when the $100^{\mathrm{th}}$ term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4. To solve this, we need to first understand the Fibonacci sequence and then find a pattern in the remainders when the terms are divided by 4.

[ADVANCE]

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 3$. We will calculate the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence and their remainders when divided by 4 to look for a pattern.

We observe that the remainders repeat every 6 terms. This suggests that the sequence of remainders is periodic with a period of 6.

[ADVANCE]

Since the sequence of remainders is periodic with a period of 6, we can find the remainder of the $100^{\mathrm{th}}$ term by finding the remainder of $100$ when divided by 6. We calculate $100 \div 6 = 16$ with a remainder of 4. This means that the remainder of the $100^{\mathrm{th}}$ term is the same as the remainder of the $4^{\mathrm{th}}$ term.

From our previous calculation, we know that the remainder of the $4^{\mathrm{th}}$ term is 3.

Therefore, the remainder when the $100^{\mathrm{th}}$ term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is $\boxed{3}$.

\[

\]
The mean of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
According to the problem, the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24

This simplifies to:
\[

\[

\[

\[

We now have two possible values for \(n\): 5 and -5. We need to check which of these values satisfy the original equation \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).

For \(n = 5\):
\[
(5-1) \cdot 5 \cdot (5+1) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120

This satisfies the original equation.

For \(n = -5\):
\[

This does not satisfy the original equation.

[ADVANCE]
We start by dividing 999 by 6 and finding the quotient and remainder.
\[ 999 \div 6 = 166 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So, the least significant digit (rightmost) in the base six representation is 3.

Next, we take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again.
\[ 166 \div 6 = 27 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
So, the next digit in the base six representation is 4.

We continue this process with the new quotient 27.
\[ 27 \div 6 = 4 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So, the next digit in the base six representation is 3.

Next, we take the quotient 4 and divide it by 6.
\[ 4 \div 6 = 0 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
Since the quotient is now 0, we stop the division process. The remainders we obtained in reverse order give us the base six representation of $999_{10}$.

[ADVANCE]

The equation of the original parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with vertex $(h,k)$. The vertex form of a parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. We can express the original equation in terms of its vertex:
\[ y = a(x-h)^2 + k. \]
Expanding this, we get:
\[ y = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k. \]
By comparing coefficients with the standard form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we have:
\[ b = -2ah, \]
\[ c = ah^2 + k. \]

[ADVANCE]

The parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$. The reflection of a point $(x,y)$ about the line $y=k$ is $(x,2k-y)$. So, the reflected parabola will have the equation:
\[ y = 2k - (ax^2 + bx + c). \]
Substituting the expressions for $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$ and $h$, we get:
\[ y = 2k - (ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k) = 2k - ax^2 + 2ahx - ah^2 - k = -ax^2 + 2ahx - ah^2 + k. \]
Thus, the equation of the reflected parabola is:
\[ y = -ax^2 + 2ahx - ah^2 + k. \]
By comparing this with the form $y=dx^2+ex+f$, we have:
\[ d = -a, \]
\[ e = 2ah, \]
\[ f = -ah^2 + k. \]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the sum $a+b+c+d+e+f$ in terms of $k$:
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = a + (-2ah) + (ah^2 + k) + (-a) + (2ah) + (-ah^2 + k). \]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ a - 2ah + ah^2 + k - a + 2ah - ah^2 + k = 2k. \]
So, the sum of the coefficients is:
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = 2k. \]

The problem requires finding an integer \( x \) that satisfies the inequality \(\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7} < \frac{1}{3}\).

[ADVANCE]

To solve the inequality, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by 7 to isolate \( x \):
\[
7 \cdot \frac{1}{4} < x < 7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{7}{4} < x < \frac{7}{3}
\]
Converting the fractions to decimal form gives us:
\[

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the only integer that satisfies this inequality is \( x = 2 \).

The problem requires forming license plates with 2 different letters followed by 2 different one-digit numbers. We need to calculate the total number of possible license plates.

[ADVANCE]

1. Calculate the number of ways to choose the 2 different letters. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, and we need to choose 2 different letters. The number of ways to choose the first letter is 26, and the number of ways to choose the second letter is 25 (since the letters must be different). Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the 2 different letters is $26 \times 25$.
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose the 2 different one-digit numbers. There are 10 one-digit numbers (0 through 9), and we need to choose 2 different numbers. The number of ways to choose the first number is 10, and the number of ways to choose the second number is 9 (since the numbers must be different). Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the 2 different one-digit numbers is $10 \times 9$.
3. Calculate the total number of possible license plates by multiplying the number of ways to choose the letters and the number of ways to choose the numbers. The total number of possible license plates is $26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 9$.

The problem involves finding the value of \(a\) that makes the piecewise function \(f(n)\) continuous. For the function to be continuous at \(n = a\), the left-hand limit as \(n\) approaches \(a\) must be equal to the right-hand limit as \(n\) approaches \(a\), and both must be equal to the value of the function at \(n = a\).

Now, we need to find $t(g(16))$, which is equivalent to $t(4)$. We substitute $x=4$ into the function $t(x) = 3-g(x)$:

The problem requires solving for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}

\[

\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( x \), we select \( x = 66 \).

\[4(3r^3+5r-6) = 12r^3 + 20r - 24\]
\[6(2r^3-r^2+4r) = 12r^3 - 6r^2 + 24r\]
Now, we can rewrite the original expression as:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
In this case, $n = 31$ and $k = 28$. We can use the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which states that $\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}$. Therefore, $\dbinom{31}{28} = \dbinom{31}{3}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Using the formula for the binomial coefficient, we can calculate $\dbinom{31}{3}$:
\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31!}{3!(31-3)!} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot 28!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29 \times 28!}{3! \times 28!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{3!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{6}

[ADVANCE]

1. **Total Arrangements Without Considering Rotations**: First, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a linear fashion, which is \(8!\). However, since the table is square and we need to account for rotations, we need to adjust for the overcounting caused by rotations.
2. **Adjusting for Rotations**: Since the table is square, there are 4 possible rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) that would result in the same arrangement. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of linear arrangements by 4 to account for these equivalent rotations.

The calculation is:
\[

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the units digit of \(8^6\), we can calculate the units digits of successive powers of 8 until we find a pattern or a repeated units digit.

\[
\begin{align*}
8^1 & = 8 \quad \text{(units digit is 8)} \\
8^2 & = 64 \quad \text{(units digit is 4)} \\
8^3 & = 512 \quad \text{(units digit is 2)} \\

8^5 & = 32768 \quad \text{(units digit is 8)} \\
8^6 & = 262144 \quad \text{(units digit is 4)}
\end{align*}
\]

We can see that the units digits of the powers of 8 repeat every 4 numbers: 8, 4, 2, 6, and then back to 8, 4, 2, 6.

Since the units digit of \(8^6\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^2\) (because \(6 \mod 4 = 2\)), the units digit of \(8^6\) is 4.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\cos(\pi + \theta) = -\cos(\theta)\) to simplify \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\):
\[
\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).

So the expression becomes:

Next, we can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that the angles are in a geometric progression to simplify the product of cosines.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so:
\[

We already know that \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), so:

Therefore, the original expression simplifies to:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let $\angle BAC = \theta.$ Then $\angle BDC = 3\theta.$ Since $AM$ is the altitude, $\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ.$ Let $BM = CM = x.$ Then $BC = 2x.$

In $\triangle ABM,$ we have $\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}.$

In $\triangle BDM,$ we have $\tan 3\theta = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x.$

We can use the triple angle formula for tangent: $\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.$ Substituting $\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11},$ we get:
\[
x = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{121 - 3x^2} \cdot \frac{1}{11} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331 - 33x^2}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by $1331 - 33x^2,$ we get:
\[
x(1331 - 33x^2) = 363x - x^3,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
1331x - 33x^3 = 363x - x^3,
\]
or
\[
1331x - 363x = 33x^3 - x^3,
\]
which further simplifies to:
\[
968x = 32x^3.
\]
Dividing both sides by $32x$ (assuming $x \neq 0$), we get:
\[
30.5 = x^2,
\]
so
\[
x = \sqrt{30.5} = \sqrt{\frac{61}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}.
\]
Now, we can find $AB$ using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ABM:$
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \frac{122}{4}} = \sqrt{121 + 30.5} = \sqrt{151.5} = \sqrt{\frac{303}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{606}}{2}.

The perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 2x = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{606}}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{122}}{2} = \sqrt{606} + \sqrt{122} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 303} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 61} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{61} = \sqrt{2} (\sqrt{303} + \sqrt{61}) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303 + 2 \sqrt{303 \cdot 61}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303 + 2 \sqrt{18483}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303 + 2 \cdot 135.65} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303 + 271.3} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{574.3} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 24 = 48.$

\[ 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \]

Next, we need to find the number of arrangements where the 2 math books are next to each other. We can treat the 2 math books as a single ""block"", so we are now arranging 5 ""objects"" (the math book block and the other 4 books). The number of ways to arrange these 5 ""objects"" is $5!$. Within the math book block, the 2 math books can be arranged in $2!$ ways (either math book 1 on the left and math book 2 on the right, or vice versa).

So, the number of arrangements where the math books are next to each other is:

\[ 5! \times 2! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 240 \]

Now, to find the number of arrangements where the math books are not next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are next to each other from the total number of arrangements:

Then, the 27 consecutive integers can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $x$.

We start by simplifying the equation:

Since $27 = 3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as:

Dividing both sides by $3^3$, we get:
\[ x+13 = 3^4. \]
Since $3^4 = 81$, we have:
\[ x+13 = 81. \]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we find:
\[ x = 68. \]
The median of the sequence is the 14th term, which is $x+13$. Substituting $x = 68$, we get:

To simplify the problem, let's introduce new variables. Set $x = a + b$ and $y = a + b + 4c.$ Then, we have $y - x = 4c,$ which implies $c = \frac{y - x}{4}.$ Also, note that $a + b + c = x + \frac{y - x}{4} = \frac{3x + y}{4}.$ The expression now becomes \[\frac{\left(\frac{3x + y}{4}\right)(x^2 + y^2)}{abc}.\] We also need to express $abc$ in terms of $x$ and $y.$ Since $a + b = x$ and $c = \frac{y - x}{4},$ we have $abc = x \cdot \frac{y - x}{4} \cdot c_{ab},$ where $c_{ab}$ is the value of $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ only.

Let's set $a + b = x$ and $a + b + 4c = y,$ then we have $4c = y - x.$ We can express $c$ as $c = \frac{y - x}{4}.$ Now, we need to find the minimum value of the expression \[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}.\] We can use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of the expression \[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}[(a + b) + (a + b + 4c)]^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2x + y)^2 = \frac{(2x + y)^2}{2}.\] Therefore, the expression becomes \[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc} \geq \frac{(a + b + c) \cdot \frac{(2x + y)^2}{2}}{abc}.\] We can simplify this expression by substituting $a + b + c = \frac{3x + y}{4}$ and $abc = ab \cdot \frac{y - x}{4}.$ However, we can use a specific case to find the minimum value.

To find the minimum value, let's consider a specific case where $a = b.$ Then, we have $x = 2a$ and $y = 2a + 4c.$ We can express $c$ as $c = \frac{y - x}{4} = \frac{(2a + 4c) - 2a}{4} = c,$ which is consistent. Now, the expression becomes \[\frac{(a + a + c)[(a + a)^2 + (a + a + 4c)^2]}{a \cdot a \cdot c} = \frac{(2a + c)(4a^2 + (2a + 4c)^2)}{a^2 c}.\] Simplifying further, we get \[\frac{(2a + c)(4a^2 + 4a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2)}{a^2 c} = \frac{(2a + c)(8a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2)}{a^2 c} = \frac{8a^2(2a + c) + 16ac(2a + c) + 16c^2(2a + c)}{a^2 c}.\] We can factor out $(2a + c)$ from the numerator: \[\frac{(2a + c)(8a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2)}{a^2 c} = \frac{8a^2(2a + c) + 16ac(2a + c) + 16c^2(2a + c)}{a^2 c} = \frac{8a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2}{a^2} \cdot \frac{2a + c}{c}.\] To find the minimum value, we can use calculus or specific values.

To find the minimum value, let's try to find a specific value of $c$ in terms of $a.$ We can use the method of setting $c = ka,$ where $k$ is a constant. Then, we have $y = 2a + 4ka = 2a(1 + 2k).$ Substituting $c = ka$ into the expression, we get \[\frac{(2a + ka)(8a^2 + 16a \cdot ka + 16(ka)^2)}{a^2 \cdot ka} = \frac{a(2 + k)(8a^2 + 16ka^2 + 16k^2a^2)}{a^3 k} = \frac{(2 + k)(8 + 16k + 16k^2)}{k}.\] Simplifying further, we get \[\frac{(2 + k)(8 + 16k + 16k^2)}{k} = \frac{16(2 + k)(1 + 2k + k^2)}{2k} = \frac{8(2 + k)(1 + 2k + k^2)}{k}.\] To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to $k$ and set it to zero.

However, we can also use a simpler approach by trying specific values of $k$ to find the minimum value. Let's try $k = 1,$ which means $c = a.$ Then, we have $x = 2a$ and $y = 6a.$ Substituting these values into the original expression, we get \[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc} = \frac{(a + a + a)[(a + a)^2 + (a + a + 4a)^2]}{a \cdot a \cdot a} = \frac{3a(4a^2 + 36a^2)}{a^3} = \frac{3a \cdot 40a^2}{a^3} = 120.\] Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\boxed{128}.$

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can break this into two separate inequalities: $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ and $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. Since $x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ (as it is a sum of even powers of $x$ with positive coefficients), this inequality is satisfied for all real $x$.

Next, we focus on the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this inequality as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. To solve this, we can make a substitution, say $y = x^2$, which transforms the inequality into $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve the quadratic inequality $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We factor the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -7)$, $(-7, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$. We test a point from the interval $(-7, 3)$, for example, $y = 0$, and find that $(0 + 7)(0 - 3) = -21 < 0$, which satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the solution to the inequality $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$ is $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we substitute back to get $-7 < x^2 < 3$. Because $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, the inequality simplifies to $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which is equivalent to $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

[OUTPUT]

The solution to the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is the interval $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

The equation $\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10$ can be rewritten as $\left(\frac{x-6}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 = 10$, which simplifies to $\frac{(x-6)^2}{4} + y^2 = 10$. Multiplying through by 4 gives $(x-6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40$.

We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that:
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We are given the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12,\]
where $s = x + y + z$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $p = xy + yz + zx$ and $q = xyz = 4$, we have:
\[sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to:
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
so:
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
So, we have:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to:
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $p = 6$.

The direction vector of the line can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two given points.

The problem involves an equilateral triangle inscribed in the parabola $x^2 = 8y$, with one vertex at the origin (vertex of the parabola). We need to find the side length of this equilateral triangle.

[ADVANCE]

Let's assume the coordinates of the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle are $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$, since the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis and the origin is one of the vertices.

Since the points lie on the parabola $x^2 = 8y$, we have $x^2 = 8y$.

For an equilateral triangle, the distance between the origin and $(x, y)$ is the same as the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$. The distance between the origin and $(x, y)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, and the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$ is $2x$.

Since it's an equilateral triangle, we have:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 2x
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 4x^2
\]
\[
y^2 = 3x^2
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{3}x \quad \text{(since $y$ is positive)}
\]
Substituting $y = \frac{x^2}{8}$ (from the parabola equation) into the equation $y = \sqrt{3}x$, we get:
\[
\frac{x^2}{8} = \sqrt{3}x
\]
\[
x^2 = 8\sqrt{3}x
\]
\[
x(x - 8\sqrt{3}) = 0
\]
So, $x = 0$ or $x = 8\sqrt{3}$. Since $x = 0$ corresponds to the origin, we take $x = 8\sqrt{3}$.

Now, we can find the corresponding $y$-coordinate:
\[
y = \frac{(8\sqrt{3})^2}{8} = \frac{192}{8} = 24
\]
We also have $y = \sqrt{3}x = \sqrt{3} \cdot 8\sqrt{3} = 24$, which confirms our value of $y$.

The side length of the equilateral triangle is $2x = 2 \cdot 8\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}$.

To find the equation of the reflected circle, we first need to determine the coordinates of the image of a point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) after reflection in the point \((4,1)\). The midpoint of the line segment joining \((x_1, y_1)\) and its image \((x_2, y_2)\) is \((4,1)\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) = (4, 1)
\]
This gives us the equations:
\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 1
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
x_1 + x_2 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y_1 + y_2 = 2
\]
So, the coordinates of the image point \((x_2, y_2)\) are:
\[
x_2 = 8 - x_1 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = 2 - y_1
\]
Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), we can substitute \(x_2\) and \(y_2\) into a new equation to find the equation of the reflected circle. The equation of the reflected circle is obtained by replacing \(x\) with \(8 - x\) and \(y\) with \(2 - y\) in the original equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\):
\[
(8 - x)^2 + (2 - y)^2 = 25

Expanding this equation, we get:

x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 4y + 43 = 0

Since $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$, we can write:
\[ ab = 210 \cdot 210^3 = 210^4. \]
Let $a = 210m$ and $b = 210n$, where $\gcd(m,n) = 1$. Then we have:
\[ (210m)(210n) = 210^4, \]

\[ mn = 210^2. \]
We need to find the number of possible values for $m$ such that $\gcd(m,n) = 1$ and $a < b$, i.e., $m < n$.

[ADVANCE]

The prime factorization of $210$ is $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. Therefore, the prime factorization of $210^2$ is:
\[ 210^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2. \]
The number of divisors of $210^2$ is:
\[ (2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3^4 = 81. \]
Since $\gcd(m,n) = 1$, we need to count the number of divisors of $210^2$ that are less than $\sqrt{210^2} = 210$. For each divisor $m$ of $210^2$ less than 210, there is a corresponding divisor $n$ such that $mn = 210^2$ and $n > m$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to exclude the case where $m = n = 210$ because it does not satisfy the condition $a < b$. Since the total number of divisors of $210^2$ is 81, and one of them is 210, the number of divisors less than 210 is:
\[ \frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40. \]
Therefore, there are 40 possible values for $m$, and hence 40 possible values for $a$.

To find the number of terms in the series, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference. Here, $a_n = 199$, $a_1 = 1$, and $d = 2$. We can set up the equation:
\[ 199 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]
Solving for $n$, we get:
\[ 199 = 1 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ 199 = 2n - 1 \]
\[ 200 = 2n \]
\[ n = 100 \]
So, there are 100 terms in the series.

Next, we calculate the sum of the arithmetic series using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms. Substituting the values, we get:

Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(2) = 1$.

The problem involves finding the greatest possible perimeter of a triangle with two sides of length 8 units each and the third side having a whole number length.

[ADVANCE]

To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Let's denote the length of the third side as \( x \). The triangle inequality states that:
1. \( x + 8 > 8 \) which simplifies to \( x > 0 \)
2. \( 8 + 8 > x \) which simplifies to \( x < 16 \)
3. \( 8 + x > 8 \) which simplifies to \( x > 0 \)

From the inequalities, we see that the possible values for \( x \) are whole numbers in the range \( 1 \leq x \leq 15 \).

[ADVANCE]

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is \( 8 + 8 + x = 16 + x \). To find the greatest possible perimeter, we need to maximize \( x \) within the allowed range. The maximum value \( x \) can take is 15.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \( x = 15 \) into the perimeter formula, we get the greatest possible perimeter as \( 16 + 15 = 31 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h \]
where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) and \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid.

We are given that $|ax^2 + bx + c| \le 1$ for all $0 \le x \le 1.$ We need to find the largest possible value of $|a| + |b| + |c|.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can start by evaluating the given inequality at specific values of $x$ to derive constraints on $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ Let's evaluate the inequality at $x = 0,$ $x = 1,$ and $x = \frac{1}{2}.$

1. At $x = 0,$ we have $|c| \le 1.$
2. At $x = 1,$ we have $|a + b + c| \le 1.$
3. At $x = \frac{1}{2},$ we have $\left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \right| \le 1.$

These inequalities provide us with some constraints on $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ We can use these constraints to find the maximum value of $|a| + |b| + |c|.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the constraints derived from the evaluations at specific values of $x$ to form a system of inequalities. Let's denote $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$ We have:

1. $|c| \le 1,$ so $-1 \le c \le 1.$
2. $|a + b + c| \le 1,$ so $-1 \le a + b + c \le 1.$
3. $\left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \right| \le 1,$ so $-1 \le \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \le 1.$

We can use these inequalities to find the values of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ that maximize $|a| + |b| + |c|.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of $|a| + |b| + |c|,$ we can consider the extreme values of $c.$ Let's assume $c = 1$ and see if we can find corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the inequalities.

Substituting $c = 1$ into the inequalities, we get:

1. $|a + b + 1| \le 1,$ so $-2 \le a + b \le 0.$
2. $\left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + 1 \right| \le 1,$ so $-2 \le \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} \le 0.$

We can solve this system of inequalities to find the values of $a$ and $b.$

Multiplying the second inequality by 4, we get $-8 \le a + 2b \le 0.$ Now we have the system:

1. $-2 \le a + b \le 0,$
2. $-8 \le a + 2b \le 0.$

We can solve this system by subtracting the first inequality from the second inequality:

$-6 \le b \le 2.$

Let's consider the extreme values of $b.$ Assume $b = -6.$ Substituting $b = -6$ into the inequality $-2 \le a + b \le 0,$ we get $4 \le a \le 6.$

So, we have $a = 6$ and $b = -6$ as a possible solution. Now, we can calculate $|a| + |b| + |c| = |6| + |-6| + |1| = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13.$

We should also consider the case when $c = -1$ to see if we can find a larger value of $|a| + |b| + |c|.$

Assuming $c = -1,$ we substitute it into the inequalities:

1. $|a + b - 1| \le 1,$ so $0 \le a + b \le 2.$
2. $\left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} - 1 \right| \le 1,$ so $0 \le \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} \le 2.$

Multiplying the second inequality by 4, we get $0 \le a + 2b \le 8.$ Now we have the system:

1. $0 \le a + b \le 2,$
2. $0 \le a + 2b \le 8.$

We can solve this system by subtracting the first inequality from the second inequality:

$0 \le b \le 6.$

Let's consider the extreme values of $b.$ Assume $b = 6.$ Substituting $b = 6$ into the inequality $0 \le a + b \le 2,$ we get $-6 \le a \le -4.$

So, we have $a = -4$ and $b = 6$ as a possible solution. Now, we can calculate $|a| + |b| + |c| = |-4| + |6| + |-1| = 4 + 6 + 1 = 11.$

Comparing the two cases, we find that the maximum value of $|a| + |b| + |c|$ is 13.

The problem involves complex number division and requires us to find the correct result of the calculation $\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}$, given the incorrect result of $\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}=\frac{11}{5}-\frac{2}{5}i$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the correct result, we can use the fact that the division of complex numbers can be performed by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. However, we can also utilize the given incorrect result to find the correct answer.

Given: $\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i$.

We need to find: $\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}$.

Notice that $\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i} = -\frac{3-4i}{1+2i} = -\frac{(3+4i) - 8i}{1+2i} = -\left(\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} - \frac{8i}{1+2i}\right) = -\left(\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} - 8i \cdot \frac{1-2i}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}\right)$.

Since we know $\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i$, we can substitute this value in.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We need to calculate $\frac{8i}{1+2i}$.

$\frac{8i}{1+2i} = \frac{8i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i} = \frac{8i(1-2i)}{1^2 + 2^2} = \frac{8i - 16i^2}{5} = \frac{8i + 16}{5} = \frac{16}{5} + \frac{8}{5}i$.

Now, substitute the values of $\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}$ and $\frac{8i}{1+2i}$ into the expression:

$\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i} = -\left(\frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i - \left(\frac{16}{5} + \frac{8}{5}i\right)\right) = -\left(\frac{11}{5} - \frac{16}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i - \frac{8}{5}i\right) = -\left(-\frac{5}{5} - \frac{10}{5}i\right) = -(-1 - 2i) = 1 + 2i$.

The problem requires us to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$, where $A$ is the sum of the positive divisors of $500$.

First, we need to find the sum of the positive divisors of $500$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$. The sum of the divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is given by the formula:
\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \cdots + p_k^{e_k})
\]
For $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$, the sum of the divisors is:
\[
\sigma(500) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 \cdot 156 = 1092
\]
So, $A = 1092$.

Next, we need to find the distinct prime divisors of $1092$. We start by finding the prime factorization of $1092$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the prime factorization of $1092$, we can divide it by the smallest prime numbers:
\[
1092 \div 2 = 546

\[
546 \div 2 = 273

\[
273 \div 3 = 91

So, the prime factorization of $1092$ is $1092 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$.

The distinct prime divisors of $1092$ are $2, 3, 7,$ and $13$.

The sum of the distinct prime divisors of $1092$ is:

The problem requires finding the coordinates of a point $P$ on the line $y = -x + 6$ that is equidistant from the points $A(10, -10)$ and $O(0, 0)$. This means the distance from $P$ to $A$ is equal to the distance from $P$ to $O$.

Let's denote the coordinates of point $P$ as $(x, y)$. Since $P$ lies on the line $y = -x + 6$, we can express $y$ as $y = -x + 6$. Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ can be written as $(x, -x + 6)$.

The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. We can use this formula to set up the equation for the distances $PA$ and $PO$.

The distance $PA$ is:
\[ PA = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 6 + 10)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2} \]

The distance $PO$ is:
\[ PO = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (-x + 6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2} \]

Since $PA = PO$, we can set the two distance expressions equal to each other:
\[ \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2} \]

We can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[ (x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2 = x^2 + (-x + 6)^2 \]

Now, we can expand and simplify the equation:
\[ x^2 - 20x + 100 + x^2 - 32x + 256 = x^2 + x^2 - 12x + 36 \]
\[ 2x^2 - 52x + 356 = 2x^2 - 12x + 36 \]

Subtract $2x^2$ from both sides:
\[ -52x + 356 = -12x + 36 \]

Add $12x$ to both sides:
\[ -40x + 356 = 36 \]

Subtract 356 from both sides:
\[ -40x = -320 \]

Divide both sides by -40:
\[ x = 8 \]

Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the value of $y$ using the equation of the line $y = -x + 6$:
\[ y = -8 + 6 = -2 \]

Therefore, the coordinates of point $P$ are $(8, -2)$.

First, let's calculate $4!$:
\[4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24.\]
So, the superfactorial $4\$ has $24$ layers of $24$ in the exponentiation tower.

Next, we need to find the units digit of $24^{24^{...^{24}}}$, which is the same as the units digit of $4^{24^{...^{24}}}$ because the units digit of $24$ is $4$.

\[4^2 = 16 \quad \text{(units digit is 6)}\]
\[4^3 = 64 \quad \text{(units digit is 4)}\]
\[4^4 = 256 \quad \text{(units digit is 6)}\]
We observe that the units digit of powers of $4$ alternates between $4$ and $6$.

Next, we need to determine the parity of the exponent $24^{...^{24}}$ to find the units digit of $4^{24^{...^{24}}}$. Since the exponent is a power of $24$ (which is even), the exponent $24^{...^{24}}$ is even.

Given that the exponent is even, the units digit of $4^{24^{...^{24}}}$ is the same as the units digit of $4^2$, which is $6$.

2. Find the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero: \(x^2 - 36x = 0 \implies x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).
3. Determine the intervals to test for the sign of the denominator: The critical points are \(x = -9, 0, 9, 36\). We need to test the sign of the expression \(x(x - 36)\) in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Test the sign of \(x(x - 36)\) in each interval:

   - In \((-9, 0)\), \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) > 0\).
   - In \((0, 9)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) < 0\).
   - In \((9, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) < 0\).
   - In \((36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive, so \(x(x - 36) > 0\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is negative.
2. From the sign analysis, the denominator is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).
3. We must exclude the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). We also need to exclude \(x = 9\) because it makes the numerator zero, and the fraction is undefined at this point.

2. $x + 1 > y$
3. $y + 1 > x$

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the inequalities for easier analysis:
1. $x + y > 1$
2. $x > y - 1$
3. $y > x - 1$

Since $x$ and $y$ are selected from the interval $(0,3)$, we can visualize the problem on a coordinate plane where $0 < x < 3$ and $0 < y < 3$. The total area of the region from which $x$ and $y$ are chosen is a square with side length 3, so the total area is $3 \times 3 = 9$.

Next, we need to find the area of the region that satisfies all three inequalities. We can graph the lines corresponding to the inequalities and find the area of the region that satisfies them.

[ADVANCE]

The inequality $x + y > 1$ represents the region above the line $x + y = 1$. The inequality $x > y - 1$ represents the region to the right of the line $x = y - 1$ or $x - y = -1$. The inequality $y > x - 1$ represents the region above the line $y = x - 1$ or $x - y = 1$.

We need to find the area of the region within the square $0 < x < 3$ and $0 < y < 3$ that satisfies all these inequalities. The region that satisfies these inequalities is the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles formed by the lines $x + y = 1$, $x = y - 1$, and $y = x - 1$ with the boundaries of the square.

[ADVANCE]

The line $x + y = 1$ intersects the x-axis at $(1,0)$ and the y-axis at $(0,1)$. The line $x = y - 1$ intersects the x-axis at $(-1,0)$ and the y-axis at $(0,-1)$, but we are only interested in the part of the line within the square, which is from $(0,1)$ to $(2,3)$. The line $y = x - 1$ intersects the x-axis at $(1,0)$ and the y-axis at $(0,-1)$, but we are only interested in the part of the line within the square, which is from $(0,1)$ to $(3,2)$.

The area of the triangle formed by the line $x + y = 1$ and the boundaries of the square is $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$. The area of the triangle formed by the line $x = y - 1$ and the boundaries of the square is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2$. The area of the triangle formed by the line $y = x - 1$ and the boundaries of the square is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2$.

However, we need to subtract the area of the two small triangles from the total area of the square to get the area of the region that satisfies the inequalities. The total area of the two small triangles is $\frac{1}{2} + 2 + 2 = \frac{9}{2}$, but we counted the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles twice, so we need to subtract the area of the two triangles from the total area of the square.

The area of the region that satisfies the inequalities is $9 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}$.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists is the ratio of the area of the region that satisfies the inequalities to the total area of the square. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{\frac{9}{2}}{9} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, where $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$. By analyzing the inequalities for the triangle and calculating the area of the region that satisfies these inequalities, we find that the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$

# Let's denote the length of the rectangular field as $L$ and the width as $W$. The radius of the semicircles is $\frac{W}{2}$.
# The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two edges of the field and the circumferences of the two semicircles. This can be expressed as: $2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 400$.

The problem requires solving the inequality $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$. The first step is to simplify the inequality by moving all terms to one side, resulting in a standard quadratic inequality.

[ADVANCE]

Subtract 10 from both sides of the inequality to get:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0.\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0$ to determine the intervals for the inequality. We can factor the quadratic expression:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
The roots are $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.

[ADVANCE]

The roots divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -2)$, $(-2, 7)$, and $(7, \infty)$. We need to test each interval to determine where the inequality $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$ holds true.

[ADVANCE]

We can choose a test point from each interval to determine the sign of the expression $(x - 7)(x + 2)$ in that interval. For the interval $(-\infty, -2)$, choose $x = -3$:
\[( -3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10 > 0.\]
For the interval $(-2, 7)$, choose $x = 0$:
\[( 0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 < 0.\]
For the interval $(7, \infty)$, choose $x = 8$:
\[( 8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0.\]
The inequality $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$ is satisfied in the interval $(-2, 7)$, including the endpoints $x = -2$ and $x = 7$ because the inequality is non-strict.

The inequality $|x-2|\leq5.6$ can be rewritten as a double inequality:
\[
-5.6 \leq x-2 \leq 5.6

To isolate $x$, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:

To find the number of integers in the interval $[-3.6, 7.6]$, we identify the smallest and largest integers within the interval. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $-3.6$ is $-3$, and the largest integer less than or equal to $7.6$ is $7$.

To find the domain of the function, we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative:
\[
(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \geq 0.
\]
We can simplify this expression by expanding the squares:
\[
(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9,
\]
\[
(x-8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.
\]
Substituting these into the inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - (x^2 - 16x + 64) \geq 0,

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 \geq 0,

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. We need to find the minimum distance from the origin to any point $(x, y)$ on the graph. The distance $D$ from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ is given by $D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can express the distance $D$ in terms of $x$ by substituting $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ into the distance formula:
\[D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}.\]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of $x^2$. Let $u = x^2$, then the expression becomes:
\[D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}}.\]
We need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}$, we can complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola given by $f(u) = au^2 + bu + c$ occurs at $u = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -2$, so:
\[u = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.\]
We substitute $u = 2$ back into the function to find the minimum value:
\[f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression inside the square root is $\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance is:
\[D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.\]

First, we need to find $f^{-1}(0)$. This means we need to solve $f(x) = 0$ for $x$. We have two cases to consider based on the definition of $f(x)$.

**Case 1:** For $x \leq 3$, we solve $3 - x = 0$. This gives $x = 3$.

**Case 2:** For $x > 3$, we solve $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$. Factoring out $x$, we get $x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0$. Since $x > 3$, $x \neq 0$, so we solve $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16$, which is positive, so there are real solutions. However, we need to check if the solutions satisfy $x > 3$. The solutions are given by $x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}$. This gives us $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, but since $x > 3$, neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

Since the only valid solution is from Case 1, we have $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

Next, we need to find $f^{-1}(6)$. This means we need to solve $f(x) = 6$ for $x$. Again, we have two cases to consider.

**Case 1:** For $x \leq 3$, we solve $3 - x = 6$. This gives $x = -3$, which satisfies $x \leq 3$.

**Case 2:** For $x > 3$, we solve $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$. Rearranging, we get $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0$. We can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, but it's not straightforward to solve without further analysis or numerical methods. However, we already have a valid solution from Case 1, so we can proceed with that.

Since the valid solution is from Case 1, we have $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.

Now, we can calculate $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0$.

\[z(x,y) = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 2y^2 - 3y = 4x^2 - 4xy - y^2 - 3y.\]
To find the optimal $y$ for Brahmagupta, we take the derivative of $z$ with respect to $y$ and set it to zero:
\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -4x - 2y - 3 = 0.\]
Solving for $y$, we get:
\[y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}.\]
This is the value of $y$ that Brahmagupta will choose in response to Archimedes' choice of $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we substitute $y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}$ back into the original function $z(x,y)$ to express $z$ as a function of $x$ only:
\[z(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}) = (2x - (-2x - \frac{3}{2}))^2 - 2(-2x - \frac{3}{2})^2 - 3(-2x - \frac{3}{2}).\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[z(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}) = (4x + \frac{3}{2})^2 - 2(4x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}) + 6x + \frac{9}{2}.\]
Expanding and simplifying further, we have:
\[z(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}) = 16x^2 + 12x + \frac{9}{4} - 8x^2 - 12x - \frac{9}{2} + 6x + \frac{9}{2} = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}.\]
To find the value of $x$ that minimizes $z$, we take the derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[\frac{dz}{dx} = 16x + 6 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[x = -\frac{6}{16} = -\frac{3}{8}.\]
This is the value of $x$ that Archimedes should choose to minimize $z$, assuming Brahmagupta will play optimally.

First, substitute $a = 8$ into the expression $\left(16\sqrt[3]{a^2}\right)^{\frac 13}$.

\[
\left(16\sqrt[3]{8^2}\right)^{\frac 13}

Next, calculate the value inside the cube root. Since $8^2 = 64$, the expression becomes:

The problem involves finding the area of the gray piece in a Chinese tangram puzzle, given that the entire figure is a square with an area of 16 square inches. We need to understand the relationships between the different pieces of the tangram and how they contribute to the total area.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of the entire square $ABCD$ is 16 square inches, so the side length of the square is $\sqrt{16} = 4$ inches. The diagonal of the square divides it into two 45-45-90 triangles, each with legs of length 4 inches. The area of each of these triangles is $\frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 4 = 8$ square inches.

The piece ""e"" is a square, and since the tangram pieces are symmetric and fit together to form the square, the side length of the square ""e"" is half the side length of the entire square, which is $\frac{4}{2} = 2$ inches. Therefore, the area of the square ""e"" is $2^2 = 4$ square inches.

The gray piece is one of the isosceles triangles in the tangram. By examining the figure, we can see that the gray piece is half of one of the smaller triangles formed by the diagonal of the square and the sides of the square. The area of the gray piece is half the area of the smaller triangle that is not part of the square ""e"".

The area of the smaller triangle that is not part of the square ""e"" can be found by subtracting the area of the square ""e"" from the area of one of the 45-45-90 triangles and then dividing by 2. The area of one of the 45-45-90 triangles is 8 square inches, and the area of the square ""e"" is 4 square inches. The area of the remaining part of the triangle is $8 - 4 = 4$ square inches. Since the gray piece is half of this remaining area, the area of the gray piece is $\frac{4}{2} = 2$ square inches.

The problem involves a circle with center $Q$ and radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ that form a right angle. Two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and to the circle with center $Q$. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is given as 14 inches. We need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as $r$. Since the smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and to the circle with center $Q$, the distance from the center of the circle $Q$ to the center of the smaller semicircle is $14 - r$ along the radius $AQ$ and $14 - r$ along the radius $BQ$. The distance between the centers of the two smaller semicircles is $2r$ because they are tangent to each other.

Since the radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle, the centers of the two smaller semicircles and the center $Q$ form a square with side length $14 - r$. The diagonal of this square is the distance between the centers of the two smaller semicircles plus the radius of the smaller semicircle to the point of tangency on the circle with center $Q$, which is $2r$. However, the diagonal of the square is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $14 - r$, so the diagonal is $\sqrt{2}(14 - r)$.

We can set up the equation:
\[
\sqrt{2}(14 - r) = 2r
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve the equation for $r$:
\[
\sqrt{2}(14 - r) = 2r
\]
\[
14\sqrt{2} - r\sqrt{2} = 2r
\]
\[
14\sqrt{2} = 2r + r\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
14\sqrt{2} = r(2 + \sqrt{2})
\]
\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})}{(2 + \sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2})}
\]
\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})}{4 - 2}
\]
\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})}{2}
\]
\[
r = 7\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})
\]
\[
r = 14\sqrt{2} - 14 \cdot 2
\]
\[
r = 14\sqrt{2} - 28
\]
\[
r = \frac{14(2\sqrt{2} - 2)}{2}
\]
\[
r = \frac{28(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{2}
\]
\[
r = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]

However, we need to express the answer as a common fraction. Let's re-evaluate the rationalization step to ensure we have the correct form.

\[
r = \frac{14\sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{14\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = \frac{14\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2})}{2} = 7\sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{2}) = 14\sqrt{2} - 14 \cdot 2 = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]

To express $14(\sqrt{2} - 1)$ as a common fraction, we can leave it in this form, but we should verify if it can be simplified further. However, the problem might be looking for a specific format. Let's consider the answer in the required format.

The radius of the smaller semicircle is $\boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}$.

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( |z| = 1 \). We need to find the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \).

[ADVANCE]

Since \( |z| = 1 \), we can represent \( z \) as \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). This means \( z^2 = e^{i2\theta} \).

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[ |1 + e^{i\theta}| + |1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta}|. \]

To simplify, we can use the fact that \( |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) for a complex number \( a + bi \).

Let's calculate \( |1 + e^{i\theta}| \):
\[ |1 + e^{i\theta}| = |1 + \cos\theta + i\sin\theta| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos\theta} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos\theta)} = \sqrt{4\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}} = 2\left|\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right|. \]

Next, we calculate \( |1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta}| \):
\[ 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta} = 1 - \cos\theta - i\sin\theta + \cos2\theta + i\sin2\theta. \]
Using the double-angle identities \( \cos2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \) and \( \sin2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \), we get:
\[ 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta} = 1 - \cos\theta - i\sin\theta + 2\cos^2\theta - 1 + i2\sin\theta\cos\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta - i\sin\theta + i2\sin\theta\cos\theta. \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta} = \cos\theta(2\cos\theta - 1) + i\sin\theta(2\cos\theta - 1) = (2\cos\theta - 1)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta). \]
Thus,
\[ |1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta}| = |2\cos\theta - 1||\cos\theta + i\sin\theta| = |2\cos\theta - 1|. \]

So, the expression becomes:
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 2\left|\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right| + |2\cos\theta - 1|. \]

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value, we need to consider the range of \( \theta \) and the behavior of the trigonometric functions involved. We can use the fact that \( -1 \leq \cos\theta \leq 1 \) and \( -1 \leq \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \leq 1 \).

Let's analyze the expression \( 2\left|\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right| + |2\cos\theta - 1| \) for different ranges of \( \theta \).

For \( \theta = 0 \), we have \( z = 1 \), and the expression becomes:
\[ |1 + 1| + |1 - 1 + 1| = 2 + 1 = 3. \]

For \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \), we have \( z = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), and the expression becomes:
\[ |1 + z| = \left|1 - \frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right| = 1, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = \left|1 + \frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2\right| = \left|1 + \frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{3}{4}\right| = \left|1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} - i\sqrt{3}\right| = \left|1 - i\sqrt{3}\right| = 2. \]
So, the expression becomes:
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 1 + 2 = 3. \]

For \( \theta = \pi \), we have \( z = -1 \), and the expression becomes:
\[ |1 - 1| + |1 + 1 + 1| = 0 + 3 = 3. \]

From the above calculations, we see that the maximum value of the expression is 3.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Translate the complex plane**: To rotate around $-4 - 5i$, we first translate the complex plane so that $-4 - 5i$ becomes the origin. This is done by subtracting $-4 - 5i$ from the complex number $3$. The translated point is $3 - (-4 - 5i) = 3 + 4 + 5i = 7 + 5i$.
2. **Rotate the translated point**: A $90^\circ$ rotation in the clockwise direction is equivalent to multiplying the translated point by $e^{-i\frac{\pi}{2}} = -i$. So, we multiply $7 + 5i$ by $-i$: $(7 + 5i)(-i) = -7i - 5i^2 = -7i + 5 = 5 - 7i$.
3. **Translate back**: Finally, we translate the rotated point back by adding $-4 - 5i$ to the result: $(5 - 7i) + (-4 - 5i) = 5 - 4 - 7i - 5i = 1 - 12i$.

To find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$, we start by writing $y = f(x) = \dfrac{2}{x+1}$. Then, we solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:
\[ y = \frac{2}{x+1} \]
\[ y(x+1) = 2 \]

\text{Midpoint} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 9/2 \\ 3/2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The direction vector of the line of reflection is the same as the direction vector of the vector from $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 9/2 \\ 3/2 \end{pmatrix}$. This direction vector is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 9/2 \\ 3/2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 9/2 - 5 \\ 3/2 - 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 3/2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
We can simplify this to $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ by multiplying by 2. The unit direction vector $\mathbf{u}$ is:
\[
\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 3^2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Now, we can use the reflection formula to find the reflection of $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$.

The reflection of $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ over the line with unit direction vector $\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is:
\[
\text{Ref}_{\mathbf{u}}\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \left( \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
First, we calculate the dot product:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} (2 + 9) = \frac{11}{\sqrt{10}}
\]
Then, we substitute this value into the reflection formula:
\[
\text{Ref}_{\mathbf{u}}\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \left( \frac{11}{\sqrt{10}} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{22}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{11}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} -11/5 \\ 33/5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -11/5 + 2 \\ 33/5 - 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -11/5 + 10/5 \\ 33/5 - 15/5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1/5 \\ 18/5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, the reflection of $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -1/5 \\ 18/5 \end{pmatrix}$.

The problem involves finding the distance between the foci of a hyperbola given its asymptotes and a point it passes through. The asymptotes of the hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x$. The hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7)$. We need to find the equation of the hyperbola and then determine the distance between its foci.

[ADVANCE]

The asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center of the hyperbola. To find the center, we solve the system of equations formed by the asymptotes:
\[
\begin{cases}
y = 2x - 3 \\
y = 17 - 2x
\end{cases}
\]
Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
2x - 3 = 17 - 2x \implies 4x = 20 \implies x = 5
\]
Substituting $x = 5$ into $y = 2x - 3$, we get:
\[
y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
\]
So, the center of the hyperbola is $(5,7)$.

The slopes of the asymptotes are $2$ and $-2$, which are negative reciprocals of each other multiplied by -1, indicating that the hyperbola is oriented with its transverse axis along a line perpendicular to the asymptotes. The standard form of the hyperbola with asymptotes $y = \pm \frac{a}{b}(x-h) + k$ is $\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$. Given the slopes, we can write the equation of the hyperbola as:
\[
\frac{(x-5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-7)^2}{4a^2} = 1
\]
or
\[
\frac{(y-7)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-5)^2}{4a^2} = 1
\]
We need to determine which form is correct and find the value of $a^2$.

Since the point $(4,7)$ lies on the hyperbola, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 7$ into the equation to find $a^2$. We will try both forms of the equation.

First, try the equation $\frac{(x-5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-7)^2}{4a^2} = 1$:
\[
\frac{(4-5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(7-7)^2}{4a^2} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{a^2} = 1 \implies a^2 = 1
\]
So, the equation of the hyperbola is $\frac{(x-5)^2}{1} - \frac{(y-7)^2}{4} = 1$.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the equation of the hyperbola, we can find the distance between the foci. For a hyperbola of the form $\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, the distance between the foci is $2c$, where $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Here, $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 4$, so:
\[
c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \implies c = \sqrt{5}
\]
The distance between the foci is:
\[
2c = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the distance between the foci of the hyperbola is $\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}$.

The problem requires finding the units digit \( N \) of the number \( 21420N \) such that the number is divisible by 6. For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since \( N \) is the units digit, it must be even for the number to be divisible by 2. The possible values for \( N \) are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To ensure the number \( 21420N \) is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \( 21420N \) is \( 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N \). We need to find which even value of \( N \) makes \( 9 + N \) divisible by 3.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We will check each possible even value of \( N \) (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) to see if \( 9 + N \) is divisible by 3.
- If \( N = 0 \), then \( 9 + 0 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
- If \( N = 2 \), then \( 9 + 2 = 11 \), which is not divisible by 3.
- If \( N = 4 \), then \( 9 + 4 = 13 \), which is not divisible by 3.
- If \( N = 6 \), then \( 9 + 6 = 15 \), which is divisible by 3.
- If \( N = 8 \), then \( 9 + 8 = 17 \), which is not divisible by 3.

So, the possible values of \( N \) that make \( 9 + N \) divisible by 3 are 0 and 6. However, the problem specifies that \( N \) is a nonzero value.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Since \( N \) must be a nonzero value, we discard \( N = 0 \). The only remaining possible value for \( N \) is 6.

To find the total number of handshakes, we need to calculate the number of handshakes between the witches and the sorcerers.

We are given a quadratic polynomial $P(x)$ with real coefficients, and we know that it satisfies the inequality $x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3$ for all real numbers $x$. We are also given that $P(11) = 181$. Our goal is to find the value of $P(16)$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's express the quadratic polynomial $P(x)$ in the general form $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. We can use the given inequality to derive some information about the coefficients of $P(x)$. Since $x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3$ for all real numbers $x$, we can rewrite the inequality as:
\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \le ax^2 + bx + c \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3. \]
This inequality must hold for all $x$, including $x = 11$. Substituting $x = 11$ into the inequality, we get:
\[ 11^2 - 2 \cdot 11 + 2 \le P(11) \le 2 \cdot 11^2 - 4 \cdot 11 + 3. \]
Simplifying the expressions, we have:
\[ 121 - 22 + 2 \le 181 \le 2 \cdot 121 - 44 + 3, \]
\[ 101 \le 181 \le 220 - 44 + 3, \]
\[ 101 \le 181 \le 179. \]
The left inequality is satisfied, but the right inequality is not tight. This suggests that $P(x)$ might be closer to the upper bound of the inequality.

[ADVANCE]

Let's assume $P(x) = k(2x^2 - 4x + 3) + (1-k)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$ for some constant $k$, which is a linear combination of the two quadratic expressions bounding $P(x)$. This form ensures that $P(x)$ satisfies the given inequality. Simplifying, we get:
\[ P(x) = k(2x^2 - 4x + 3) + (1-k)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = (2k + 1 - k)x^2 + (-4k - 2 + 2k)x + (3k + 2 - 2k), \]
\[ P(x) = (k + 1)x^2 + (-2k - 2)x + (k + 2). \]
We are given that $P(11) = 181$, so we substitute $x = 11$ into the expression for $P(x)$:
\[ 181 = (k + 1) \cdot 11^2 + (-2k - 2) \cdot 11 + (k + 2), \]
\[ 181 = (k + 1) \cdot 121 + (-2k - 2) \cdot 11 + (k + 2), \]
\[ 181 = 121k + 121 - 22k - 22 + k + 2, \]
\[ 181 = 100k + 101, \]
\[ 80 = 100k, \]
\[ k = \frac{80}{100} = \frac{4}{5}. \]
Now that we have the value of $k$, we can find the expression for $P(x)$:
\[ P(x) = \left(\frac{4}{5} + 1\right)x^2 + \left(-2 \cdot \frac{4}{5} - 2\right)x + \left(\frac{4}{5} + 2\right), \]
\[ P(x) = \frac{9}{5}x^2 - \frac{18}{5}x + \frac{14}{5}. \]
Finally, we need to find $P(16)$:
\[ P(16) = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 16^2 - \frac{18}{5} \cdot 16 + \frac{14}{5}, \]
\[ P(16) = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 256 - \frac{18}{5} \cdot 16 + \frac{14}{5}, \]
\[ P(16) = \frac{2304}{5} - \frac{288}{5} + \frac{14}{5}, \]
\[ P(16) = \frac{2304 - 288 + 14}{5}, \]
\[ P(16) = \frac{2030}{5}, \]
\[ P(16) = 406. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]
First, simplify the equation by performing the arithmetic operations. The equation is:
\[3 \cdot 5^2 - \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 63.\]
Calculate $5^2$:
\[3 \cdot 25 - \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 63.\]
This simplifies to:
\[75 - \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 63.\]
Next, isolate the term involving $a$ by subtracting 75 from both sides:
\[- \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} =63 - 75.\]
This simplifies to:
\[- \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = -12.\]
Multiply both sides by -3 to clear the fraction:
\[4(5-a)^2 = 36.\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[(5-a)^2 = 9.\]
Take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative roots:
\[5-a = \pm 3.\]
This gives us two possible equations:
\[5-a = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 5-a = -3.\]
Solve each equation for $a$:
\[a = 5 - 3 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8.\]

[ADVANCE]

First, we reduce the bases modulo 11:
\[129 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}\]
\[96 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}\]
So, the expression \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is congruent to \(7^{34} + 7^{38} \pmod{11}\).

Next, we can factor out \(7^{34}\) from the expression:
\[7^{34} + 7^{38} = 7^{34}(1 + 7^4)\]
Now, we need to find \(7^4 \pmod{11}\):
\[7^2 = 49 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\]
\[7^4 = (7^2)^2 \equiv 5^2 = 25 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[7^{34}(1 + 7^4) \equiv 7^{34}(1 + 3) \equiv 7^{34} \cdot 4 \pmod{11}\]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify \(7^{34} \pmod{11}\), we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is an integer not divisible by \(p\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\). Here, \(p = 11\) and \(a = 7\), so:
\[7^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\]
We can express \(7^{34}\) in terms of \(7^{10}\):
\[7^{34} = (7^{10})^3 \cdot 7^4 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 7^4 \equiv 7^4 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[7^{34} \cdot 4 \equiv 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\]

Let's calculate $\sin^2 18^\circ$ and $\sin^3 18^\circ$ using the value of $\sin 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}.$

$\sin^2 18^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{(\sqrt{5}-1)^2}{16} = \frac{5-2\sqrt{5}+1}{16} = \frac{6-2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{8}.$

$\sin^3 18^\circ = \sin 18^\circ \cdot \sin^2 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4} \cdot \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{(\sqrt{5}-1)(3-\sqrt{5})}{32} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}-5-3+\sqrt{5}}{32} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}-8}{32} = \frac{\sqrt{5}-2}{8}.$

Now, we can find the value of $\sin^3 18^\circ + \sin^2 18^\circ$ by adding the two expressions together:

$\sin^3 18^\circ + \sin^2 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5}-2}{8} + \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{5}-2+3-\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{1}{8}.$

First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Substituting the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into the distance formula, we get:

We are given that this cross product equals $\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}$, so we can set up the following system of equations:

Simplify the equation:

And substitute $y = -30$ back into the expression for $z$:
\[z = -10(-30) - 180 = 300 - 180 = 120.\]

The problem asks for the projection of vector $\mathbf{a}$ onto vector $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, given that the dot product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 8$.

The formula for the projection of $\mathbf{a}$ onto $\mathbf{b}$ is given by:
\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}
\]
We need to calculate $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}$, which is the dot product of $\mathbf{b}$ with itself.

[ADVANCE]

Calculate the dot product $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}$:
\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 36 + 9 = 49
\]
Now, we can substitute the given value of $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 8$ and the calculated value of $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 49$ into the projection formula:
\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a} = \frac{8}{49} \mathbf{b} = \frac{8}{49} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{8}{49} \cdot 2 \\ \frac{8}{49} \cdot 6 \\ \frac{8}{49} \cdot 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{16}{49} \\ \frac{48}{49} \\ \frac{24}{49} \end{pmatrix}

We start by using the property of the arccosine function. Let $\alpha = \arccos x$, $\beta = \arccos 2x$, and $\gamma = \arccos 3x$. Then, we have $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$. Since $\alpha = \arccos x$, $\beta = \arccos 2x$, and $\gamma = \arccos 3x$, we know that $x = \cos \alpha$, $2x = \cos \beta$, and $3x = \cos \gamma$.

Using the cosine addition formula, we can express $\cos(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) = \cos \pi = -1$. The cosine addition formula for three angles is given by:
\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta \cos \gamma - \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \gamma - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \gamma.
\]
Since $\cos(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) = -1$, we have:
\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta \cos \gamma - \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \gamma - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \gamma = -1.
\]
Substituting $\cos \alpha = x$, $\cos \beta = 2x$, and $\cos \gamma = 3x$, we get:
\[
x \cdot 2x \cdot 3x - \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cdot 3x - \sin \alpha \cdot 2x \cdot \sin \gamma - x \cdot \sin \beta \cdot \sin \gamma = -1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\6x^3 - 3x \sin \alpha \sin \beta - 2x \sin \alpha \sin \gamma - x \sin \beta \sin \gamma = -1.
\]
We need to express $\sin \alpha$, $\sin \beta$, and $\sin \gamma$ in terms of $x$. Using the identity $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$, we have:
\[
\sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - x^2}, \quad \sin \beta = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}, \quad \sin \gamma = \sqrt{1 - 9x^2}.
\]
Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
6x^3 - 3x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - 4x^2} - 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - 9x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - 4x^2} \sqrt{1 - 9x^2} = -1.
\]
This equation is quite complex, so we will simplify it further by squaring both sides or finding a relationship that can help us form a polynomial equation in $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that $\arccos x + \arccos 2x + \arccos 3x = \pi$ to find a relationship between $x$ and the cosine values. Since $\arccos x = \alpha$, $\arccos 2x = \beta$, and $\arccos 3x = \gamma$, we have $\alpha + \beta = \pi - \gamma$. Taking the cosine of both sides, we get:
\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\pi - \gamma) = -\cos \gamma.
\]
Using the cosine addition formula, we have:
\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = -\cos \gamma.
\]
Substituting $\cos \alpha = x$, $\cos \beta = 2x$, and $\cos \gamma = 3x$, we get:
\[
x \cdot 2x - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = -3x.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x^2 - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = -3x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
2x^2 + 3x = \sin \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
We also know that $\sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ and $\sin \beta = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}$. Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
2x^2 + 3x = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(2x^2 + 3x)^2 = (1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2).
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
4x^4 + 12x^3 + 9x^2 = 1 - 5x^2 + 4x^4.
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
12x^3 + 14x^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a cubic polynomial equation in $x$. The coefficients are $a = 12$, $b = 14$, $c = 0$, and $d = -1$. The sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is:
\[
|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| = |12| + |14| + |0| + |-1| = 12 + 14 + 0 + 1 = 27.
\]
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d|$ is $\boxed{27}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The given polynomial equation is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. We can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a polynomial $x^4 + bx^3 + c = 0$ with roots $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -b = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We need to find the unordered set $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$.

Let's denote the expressions we need to find as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. We know that:
\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0.
\]
So, we have $a + b + c = 0$.

We also know that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -2(-2) = 4.
\]
Thus, we have $abc = 4$.

Since $a + b + c = 0$ and $abc = 4$, the unordered set $\{a, b, c\}$ consists of the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0$, which simplifies to $t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t - 4 = 0$. We need to find the value of $ab + bc + ca$.

We can use the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$ to find $ab + bc + ca$. By multiplying the equation $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$ by $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4$, we get:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3)) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_4)) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)) + (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)) = 0.
\]
Using $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2$, we can substitute $\alpha_4 = -2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \alpha_3$, and similarly for the other roots. After some algebraic manipulations, we can find that:
\[
ab + bc + ca = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = -2.
\]
Thus, the polynomial whose roots are $a, b, c$ is $t^3 - 0t^2 - 2t - 4 = 0$, or simply $t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0$.

We need to find the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0$. By inspection, we can see that $t = 2$ is a root. We can perform polynomial division to factorize the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2) = 0.
\]
The quadratic factor $t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0$ can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.
\]
Thus, the roots of the polynomial are $2, -1 + i, -1 - i$. Therefore, the unordered set is $\{2, -1 + i, -1 - i\}$.

The problem requires finding the largest integer less than 2010 that satisfies multiple remainder conditions when divided by 7, 11, and 13. We need to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this system of congruences.

The conditions are:
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \]
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{13} \]

Since the moduli are pairwise coprime (7, 11, and 13 have no common factors other than 1), we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli, which is $7 \times 11 \times 13 = 1001$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we note that the last two congruences can be combined since they both have the same remainder:
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \]
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{13} \]
implies
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{143} \]
since 11 and 13 are coprime. Now we have the system:
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{143} \]

We can express the second congruence as:
\[ x = 143k + 10 \]
for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the first congruence, we get:
\[ 143k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
Since $143 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$, we can simplify this to:
\[ 6k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[ 6k \equiv -5 \pmod{7} \]
Since $-5 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we have:
\[ 6k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
To solve for $k$, we need the multiplicative inverse of 6 modulo 7. The inverse of 6 modulo 7 is 6, since $6 \times 6 = 36 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:
\[ k \equiv 12 \pmod{7} \]
\[ k \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
So, we can write $k$ as:
\[ k = 7m + 5 \]
for some integer $m$. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$, we get:
\[ x = 143(7m + 5) + 10 \]
\[ x = 1001m + 715 + 10 \]
\[ x = 1001m + 725 \]
This is the general solution to the system of congruences. To find the largest integer less than 2010, we need to find the largest value of $m$ such that:
\[ 1001m + 725 < 2010 \]
Subtracting 725 from both sides gives:
\[ 1001m < 1285 \]
Dividing both sides by 1001 gives:
\[ m < \frac{1285}{1001} \]
\[ m < 1.284 \]
Since $m$ is an integer, the largest possible value of $m$ is 1. Therefore, the largest integer less than 2010 that satisfies the conditions is:
\[ x = 1001 \times 1 + 725 = 1726 \]

\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{143} \]
Then we solved the system:
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ x \equiv 10 \pmod{143} \]
to find the general solution:
\[ x = 1001m + 725 \]
for some integer $m$. The largest integer less than 2010 is obtained by setting $m = 1$, giving:

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can use the given information to find the value of the constant $k$. Substituting $x=24$ and $y=15$ into the equation $y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}}$, we get:
\[ 15 = \frac{k}{\sqrt{24}} \]
Since $\sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = 2\sqrt{6}$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 15 = \frac{k}{2\sqrt{6}} \]
Solving for $k$, we multiply both sides by $2\sqrt{6}$:
\[ k = 15 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 30\sqrt{6} \]
Now that we have the value of $k$, we can write the equation for $y$ as:
\[ y = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{x}} \]
We need to find the value of $x$ when $y=3$. Substituting $y=3$ into the equation, we get:

Next, we solve for $\sqrt{x}$ by multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{x}$:
\[ 3\sqrt{x} = 30\sqrt{6} \]
Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ \sqrt{x} = 10\sqrt{6} \]
To find $x$, we square both sides:
\[ x = (10\sqrt{6})^2 = 100 \cdot 6 = 600 \]

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$. We are given that the area of the triangle is $16\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 16\sqrt{3}

We can solve for $s^2$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[
\frac{s^2}{4} = 16
\]
Then, multiply both sides by 4:
\[
s^2 = 64
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 8
\]
So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 8 centimeters.

Next, we know that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is $3s = 3 \times 8 = 24$ centimeters. Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the triangle, the perimeter of the square is also 24 centimeters. The perimeter of a square is given by $4x$, where $x$ is the side length of the square. So, we can set up the equation:

So, the side length of the square is 6 centimeters.

Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of a square with side length $x$ is given by $x\sqrt{2}$. Substituting $x = 6$, we get:

We need to find the minimum value of $a^4 + b^8$ given that $ab^2 = 5$ for positive real numbers $a$ and $b$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $a$ in terms of $b$ using the constraint $ab^2 = 5$. This gives us $a = \frac{5}{b^2}$.

Next, we substitute $a = \frac{5}{b^2}$ into the expression $a^4 + b^8$ to get a function of a single variable $b$:
\[a^4 + b^8 = \left(\frac{5}{b^2}\right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.\]

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $\frac{625}{b^8} + b^8$, we can use calculus. Let's define the function $f(b) = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8$. We need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of $f(b)$ with respect to $b$ and setting it to zero:
\[f'(b) = -\frac{625 \cdot 8}{b^9} + 8b^7 = -\frac{5000}{b^9} + 8b^7.\]
Setting $f'(b) = 0$, we get:
\[-\frac{5000}{b^9} + 8b^7 = 0.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[\frac{5000}{b^9} = 8b^7.\]
Multiplying both sides by $b^9$, we get:
\[5000 = 8b^{16}.\]
Dividing both sides by 8, we obtain:
\[b^{16} = \frac{5000}{8} = 625.\]
Taking the 16th root of both sides, we get:
\[b = \sqrt[16]{625} = \sqrt[16]{5^4} = 5^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{5}.\]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the value of $b$, we can find the corresponding value of $a$ using the constraint $ab^2 = 5$:
\[a = \frac{5}{b^2} = \frac{5}{(\sqrt[4]{5})^2} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{5}} = \sqrt{5}.\]
We substitute $a = \sqrt{5}$ and $b = \sqrt[4]{5}$ into the expression $a^4 + b^8$ to find the minimum value:
\[a^4 + b^8 = (\sqrt{5})^4 + (\sqrt[4]{5})^8 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50.\]

The minimum value of $a^4 + b^8$ given that $ab^2 = 5$ for positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ is $\boxed{50}$.

The problem asks for the range of the function \( f(x) = (\arccos x)^2 + (\arcsin x)^2 \). We need to understand the domains and ranges of the individual functions involved, \(\arccos x\) and \(\arcsin x\), and how they contribute to the overall function \(f(x)\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Recall the domains and ranges of \(\arccos x\) and \(\arcsin x\):
   - The domain of \(\arccos x\) is \([-1, 1]\) and its range is \([0, \pi]\).
   - The domain of \(\arcsin x\) is \([-1, 1]\) and its range is \left[\-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right].

2. Since the domain of \(f(x)\) is the intersection of the domains of \(\arccos x\) and \(\arcsin x\), the domain of \(f(x)\) is \([-1, 1]\).

3. To find the range of \(f(x)\), we need to evaluate \(f(x)\) at the endpoints of the domain and check for any critical points within the domain.

4. Evaluate \(f(x)\) at the endpoints:
   - When \(x = 1\), \(\arccos 1 = 0\) and \(\arcsin 1 = \frac{\pi}{2}\), so \(f(1) = 0^2 + \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4}\).
   - When \(x = -1\), \(\arccos(-1) = \pi\) and \(\arcsin(-1) = -\frac{\pi}{2}\), so \(f(-1) = \pi^2 + \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2 = \pi^2 + \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{5\pi^2}{4}\).

5. To find any critical points, we need to take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero:
   - The derivative of \(f(x)\) is \(f'(x) = 2\arccos x \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) + 2\arcsin x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} (\arcsin x - \arccos x)\).
   - Set \(f'(x) = 0\), then \(\arcsin x - \arccos x = 0\), so \(\arcsin x = \arccos x\).
   - Since \(\arcsin x + \arccos x = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we have \(2\arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}\), so \(\arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
   - Evaluate \(f(x)\) at \(x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\):
     \(\arccos \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\arcsin \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so \(f\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{16} = \frac{\pi^2}{8}\).

6. Compare the values of \(f(x)\) at the endpoints and the critical point:
   - The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\) and the maximum value is \(\frac{5\pi^2}{4}\).

Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) is \(\left[\frac{\pi^2}{8}, \frac{5\pi^2}{4}\right]\).

The problem provides a recursive function \( f(n + 1) = (-1)^{n + 1} n - 2f(n) \) for \( n \ge 1 \), with the additional condition that \( f(1) = f(1986) \). We are asked to find the value of the sum \( f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's start by calculating the values of \( f(n) \) for the first few values of \( n \) to identify any patterns.

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ f(2) = (-1)^{1 + 1} \cdot 1 - 2f(1) = 1 - 2f(1) \]

For \( n = 2 \):
\[ f(3) = (-1)^{2 + 1} \cdot 2 - 2f(2) = -2 - 2(1 - 2f(1)) = -2 - 2 + 4f(1) = -4 + 4f(1) \]

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ f(4) = (-1)^{3 + 1} \cdot 3 - 2f(3) = 3 - 2(-4 + 4f(1)) = 3 + 8 - 8f(1) = 11 - 8f(1) \]

We can observe that the function \( f(n) \) seems to be alternating between expressions involving \( f(1) \) and constants. To find a general form, let's assume \( f(n) = a_n + b_n f(1) \), where \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are constants to be determined.

Next, we need to find the sum \( f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \). Given the recursive nature of the function, we can use the condition \( f(1) = f(1986) \) to derive a relationship that helps in finding the sum.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's use the recursive formula to express \( f(n+1) + f(n-1) \) in terms of \( f(n) \):
\[ f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) \]
\[ f(n-1) = (-1)^n (n-1) - 2f(n-2) \]

We can now sum \( f(n+1) \) and \( f(n-1) \):
\[ f(n+1) + f(n-1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) + (-1)^n (n-1) - 2f(n-2) \]
\[ f(n+1) + f(n-1) = (-1)^{n+1} n + (-1)^n (n-1) - 2f(n) - 2f(n-2) \]
\[ f(n+1) + f(n-1) = (-1)^n (-n + n - 1) - 2(f(n) + f(n-2)) \]
\[ f(n+1) + f(n-1) = -(-1)^n - 2(f(n) + f(n-2)) \]

Now, let's sum \( f(n) \) from 1 to 1985:
\[ S = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \]

Using the recursive relation and the fact that \( f(1) = f(1986) \), we can pair the terms:
\[ f(1) + f(1985) + f(2) + f(1984) + \dots + f(993) + f(993) = S \]

From the relation \( f(n+1) + f(n-1) = -(-1)^n - 2(f(n) + f(n-2)) \), we can see that the sum of each pair is related. However, we need to find a way to express the sum \( S \) using the given information.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's use the given recursive relation to find a pattern in the sum. We can write the recursive relation for \( f(n+1) \) and \( f(n) \):
\[ f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) \]

We can now sum the recursive relations for \( n = 1, 2, \dots, 1985 \):
\[ \sum_{n=1}^{1985} f(n+1) = \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n - 2 \sum_{n=1}^{1985} f(n) \]

The left-hand side can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_{n=1}^{1985} f(n+1) = \sum_{n=2}^{1986} f(n) = f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1986) \]
\[ = f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) + f(1986) \]
\[ = S - f(1) + f(1986) \]
\[ = S - f(1) + f(1) \]
\[ = S \]

So, we have:
\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n - 2S \]
\[ 3S = \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n \]

Now, we need to evaluate the sum \( \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The sum \( \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n \) can be evaluated as follows:
\[ \sum_{n=1}^{1985} (-1)^{n+1} n = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \dots + 1985 \]

This is an alternating sum of the first 1985 positive integers. We can group the terms in pairs:
\[ (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \dots + (1983 - 1984) + 1985 \]
\[ = -1 - 1 - \dots - 1 + 1985 \]
There are 992 pairs of -1, so the sum is:
\[ -992 + 1985 = 993 \]

Therefore, we have:
\[ 3S = 993 \]
\[ S = \frac{993}{3} \]
\[ S = 331 \]

The denominator 160 can be factored into prime factors: $160 = 2^5 \times 5$. Since the denominator is already in the form of $2^a \times 5^b$ (where $a = 5$ and $b = 1$), the fraction $\frac{57}{160}$ can be expressed as a terminating decimal.

Let's denote the length of the hypotenuse as $c$. Since the altitude to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, we have:
\[ \frac{c}{2} = 4\sqrt{2} \]
Solving for $c$, we get:

In an isosceles right triangle, the legs are of equal length, and the relationship between the legs ($a$) and the hypotenuse ($c$) is given by:
\[ c = a\sqrt{2} \]

The function is defined if the denominator is not zero and the expression inside the square root is positive.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The denominator of the function is $\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}$, which must be positive (since it's under a square root and we're looking for real values). So, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $x^2-5x+6 > 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression as $(x-2)(x-3) > 0$.

To solve the inequality $(x-2)(x-3) > 0$, we can use the sign chart method or analyze the intervals where the expression is positive. The roots of the equation $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$ are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$, which divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$.

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
- For $x < 2$ (e.g., $x = 0$), $(0-2)(0-3) = 6 > 0$.
- For $2 < x < 3$ (e.g., $x = 2.5$), $(2.5-2)(2.5-3) = -0.25 < 0$.
- For $x > 3$ (e.g., $x = 4$), $(4-2)(4-3) = 2 > 0$.

So, the inequality $(x-2)(x-3) > 0$ is satisfied when $x \in (-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)$.

The probability of a single die showing a number other than 1 is $\frac{5}{6}$, and the probability of a single die showing 1 is $\frac{1}{6}$. We are looking for the probability that exactly two out of $n$ dice show a number other than 1, which can be modeled using the binomial probability formula:
\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}

where $k = 2$, $p = \frac{5}{6}$, and $1-p = \frac{1}{6}$. Plugging in these values, we get:

We can simplify the equation:
\[

Cancel out the factor of 25 from both sides:
\[
\binom{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{1}{216}

Multiply both sides by 36:
\[
\binom{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{36}{216} = \frac{1}{6}

Rewrite $\binom{n}{2}$ as $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Rewrite the equation:
\[
n(n-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6^{n-2}

We need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation. We can test different values of $n$ to find the solution.

Let's test $n = 3$:
\[
3(3-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6^{3-2} \implies 6 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6 \implies 6 = 2

This is not true, so $n \neq 3$.

This is true, so $n = 4$ is a solution.

The problem asks for the quotient when the polynomial $x^9 + 1$ is divided by $x - 1$. This is a division problem involving polynomials, and we can use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem to find the quotient.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that $x^9 + 1$ can be factored using the sum of cubes or the sum of ninth powers, but a more straightforward approach is to use polynomial division. However, we can also use the fact that $x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2$ when divided by $x - 1$. This is derived from the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

[ADVANCE]

From the division algorithm for polynomials, we know that:
\[ x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)q(x) + r \]
where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder. Since the divisor is a linear polynomial $x - 1$, the remainder $r$ must be a constant. By the remainder theorem, we can find the remainder by evaluating $x^9 + 1$ at $x = 1$:
\[ 1^9 + 1 = 2 \]
So, the remainder is 2. Therefore, we can write:
\[ x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2 \]
By comparing this with the division algorithm, we can see that the quotient is $x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.

The problem involves calculating the difference in gasoline consumption between two types of vehicles: a fuel-efficient hybrid car and an SUV. We are given the total miles driven (12,000 miles), the mileage of the SUV (15 miles per gallon), and the mileage of the hybrid car (48 miles per gallon). We need to find the number of gallons of gasoline saved by driving the hybrid car instead of the SUV.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the number of gallons of gasoline saved, we need to calculate the amount of gasoline consumed by each vehicle and then find the difference. The formula to calculate the gasoline consumption is:
\[ \text{Gasoline consumption} = \frac{\text{Total miles driven}}{\text{Mileage of the vehicle}} \]

For the SUV:
\[ \text{Gasoline consumption}_{\text{SUV}} = \frac{12000 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 800 \text{ gallons} \]

For the hybrid car:
\[ \text{Gasoline consumption}_{\text{hybrid}} = \frac{12000 \text{ miles}}{48 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 250 \text{ gallons} \]

The difference in gasoline consumption (i.e., the gasoline saved) is:
\[ \text{Gasoline saved} = \text{Gasoline consumption}_{\text{SUV}} - \text{Gasoline consumption}_{\text{hybrid}} = 800 \text{ gallons} - 250 \text{ gallons} = 550 \text{ gallons} \]

The problem involves a function $f(x) = 2^x$ and requires us to find the value of $\sqrt{f(f(f(f(1))))}.$ We need to evaluate the function step by step starting from the innermost function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we calculate $f(1)$:
\[ f(1) = 2^1 = 2. \]

Next, we calculate $f(f(1)) = f(2)$:
\[ f(2) = 2^2 = 4. \]

Then, we calculate $f(f(f(1))) = f(4)$:
\[ f(4) = 2^4 = 16. \]

Finally, we calculate $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(16)$:
\[ f(16) = 2^{16} = 65536. \]

Now, we need to find the square root of $f(f(f(f(1))))$:
\[ \sqrt{f(f(f(f(1))))} = \sqrt{65536}. \]

The problem involves finding the integer value of \( x \) in the arithmetic sequence \( 3^2, x, 3^4 \).

[ADVANCE]

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 3^2 = 3^4 - x \]
This equation represents the fact that the difference between the first term and \( x \) is equal to the difference between \( x \) and the third term.

[ADVANCE]

Now, let's solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ x - 9 = 81 - x \]
Add \( x \) to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x - 9 = 81 \]
Add 9 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 90 \]

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region of points closer to $O$ than to any vertex, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $O$ to a vertex will divide the plane into two regions: one closer to $O$ and the other closer to the vertex. The intersection of these regions will give us the area where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Consider the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$. These bisectors will form a smaller rectangle whose center is also $O$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining $O$ to the vertices of the original rectangle.

Let's denote the coordinates of $A$ as $(-a, b)$, $B$ as $(a, b)$, $C$ as $(a, -b)$, and $D$ as $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ will be at the origin $(0, 0)$. The midpoint of $OA$ will be $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OB$ will be $\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OC$ will be $\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$, and the midpoint of $OD$ will be $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$.

The area of the smaller rectangle (where points are closer to $O$) will be $\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \times \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = ab$.

The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a \times 2b = 4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

Given the fact that $17 \cdot 5 = 85$, we can rewrite this as $17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}$. To find the inverse of $17$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by $17$, gives a result congruent to $1$ modulo $83$.

We can use the given information to find the inverse. Since $17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}$, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $4$ to get:
\[17 \cdot 20 \equiv 8 \pmod{83}.\]
We need to get $1$ on the right-hand side, so we can multiply both sides by the inverse of $8$ modulo $83$, but it's easier to notice that we can continue to manipulate the equation to get the desired result.

[ADVANCE]

We can continue by multiplying both sides of the congruence $17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}$ by the inverse of $2$ modulo $83$, which is $42$ since $2 \cdot 42 = 84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}$. Thus, we have:
\[17 \cdot 5 \cdot 42 \equiv 2 \cdot 42 \pmod{83}.\]
This simplifies to:

Since $84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}$, we have:

We can reduce $210$ modulo $83$ to find the smallest positive residue:
\[210 = 2 \cdot 83 + 44,\]
so
\[210 \equiv 44 \pmod{83}.\]
Therefore, we have:

To solve the congruence $14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}$, we first note that the gcd of 14 and 100 is 2. We can divide the entire congruence by 2, which gives us $7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}$. This is because we are also dividing the modulus 100 by 2.

Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is an integer $x$ such that $7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
\[
50 = 7 \cdot 7 + 1
\]
\[
1 = 50 - 7 \cdot 7
\]
This shows that the inverse of 7 modulo 50 is -7, which is equivalent to $50 - 7 = 43$ modulo 50. So, the inverse of 7 modulo 50 is 43.

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}$ by 43:
\[
u \equiv 23 \cdot 43 \pmod{50}
\]
\[
u \equiv 989 \pmod{50}
\]
\[
u \equiv 39 \pmod{50}

This means that the general solution to the congruence is $u = 39 + 50k$, where $k$ is an integer.

The two smallest positive integer solutions occur when $k = 0$ and $k = 1$, giving us $u = 39$ and $u = 89$.

Next, we need to find the average of these two solutions:

1. The sum of the digits of the original number is $13$: $a + b = 13$.
2. The difference between the original number and the number with its digits reversed is $27$: $(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27$.

We need to find the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed, which is $(10a + b) + (10b + a)$.

From the second piece of information, we can simplify the equation:
\[
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27 \implies 9a - 9b = 27 \implies a - b = 3.
\]
Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
a + b = 13 \\

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 13 + 3 \implies 2a = 16 \implies a = 8.
\]
Substituting $a = 8$ into the first equation:
\[
8 + b = 13 \implies b = 5.

To find the number of representatives for the 8th grade, we need to determine the ratio of the total enrollment to the total number of representatives. The total enrollment is \(520 + 650 = 1170\), and the total number of representatives is 18.

The ratio of the enrollment of the 8th grade to the total enrollment is \(\frac{650}{1170}\). This ratio should be equal to the ratio of the number of representatives of the 8th grade to the total number of representatives.

From the transformation of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$, we have:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
This gives us the equations:
\[
a - 3b = 7 \quad \text{(3)}
\]
\[
c - 3d = -1 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

We can solve equations (1) and (3) to find $a$ and $b$. Multiply equation (1) by 3:
\[
6a - 3b = 27 \quad \text{(5)}
\]
Subtract equation (3) from equation (5):
\[
(6a - 3b) - (a - 3b) = 27 - 7
\]
\[
5a = 20
\]
\[
a = 4
\]
Substitute $a = 4$ into equation (1):
\[
2(4) - b = 9
\]
\[
8 - b = 9
\]
\[
b = -1
\]

We can solve equations (2) and (4) to find $c$ and $d$. Multiply equation (2) by 3:
\[
6c - 3d = 9 \quad \text{(6)}
\]
Subtract equation (4) from equation (6):
\[
(6c - 3d) - (c - 3d) = 9 - (-1)
\]
\[
5c = 10
\]
\[
c = 2
\]
Substitute $c = 2$ into equation (2):
\[
2(2) - d = 3
\]
\[
4 - d = 3
\]
\[
d = 1

So, the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the image of the line $y = 2x + 1$ under the transformation $\mathbf{M}$. We can express the line in parametric form as $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x + 1 \end{pmatrix} = x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Applying the transformation $\mathbf{M}$ to the parametric form, we get:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4x - (2x + 1) \\ 2x + (2x + 1) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x - 1 \\ 4x + 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Let the new coordinates be $(x', y') = (2x - 1, 4x + 1)$. We need to express $y'$ in terms of $x'$.

From $x' = 2x - 1$, we can solve for $x$:
\[
x' + 1 = 2x
\]
\[
x = \frac{x' + 1}{2}
\]
Substitute $x = \frac{x' + 1}{2}$ into $y' = 4x + 1$:
\[
y' = 4 \left( \frac{x' + 1}{2} \right) + 1
\]
\[
y' = 2(x' + 1) + 1
\]
\[
y' = 2x' + 2 + 1
\]
\[
y' = 2x' + 3
\]

So, the image of the line $y = 2x + 1$ under the transformation $\mathbf{M}$ is $y = 2x + 3$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{y = 2x + 3}$

The problem is asking for the number of ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students. This is a classic combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.

[ADVANCE]

The number of ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students can be calculated using the combination formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
where \(n\) is the total number of students (6 in this case), and \(k\) is the number of students to be selected (5 in this case).

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
\[
C(6, 5) = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6 \times 5!}{5! \times 1} = 6

The problem asks for the integer roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\). To find the integer roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of the polynomial \(a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\) must be of the form \(p/q\), where \(p\) is a factor of the constant term \(a_0\) and \(q\) is a factor of the leading coefficient \(a_n\).

For the given polynomial \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), the constant term is \(-14\) and the leading coefficient is \(1\). The factors of \(-14\) are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14\), and the factors of \(1\) are \(\pm 1\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will test these possible rational roots by substituting them into the polynomial equation to see if any of them satisfy the equation.

1. Test \(x = 1\):
\[1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0.\]
So, \(x = 1\) is a root.

Since \(x = 1\) is a root, we can perform polynomial division to factor the polynomial and find the other roots.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will perform polynomial division of \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14\) by \(x - 1\).

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}

1 & & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
\hline
& 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\), so we can write the polynomial as:
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14).\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\). We will again use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14\).

2. Test \(x = -1\):
\[(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 - 15 + 14 = 4 \neq 0.\]
So, \(x = -1\) is not a root.

3. Test \(x = -2\):
\[(-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0.\]
So, \(x = -2\) is a root.

Since \(x = -2\) is a root, we can perform polynomial division to factor the cubic polynomial and find the other roots.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will perform polynomial division of \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\) by \(x + 2\).

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
& 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
-2 & & -2 & -8 & -14 \\
\hline
& 1 & 4 & 7 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \(x^2 + 4x + 7\), so we can write the cubic polynomial as:
\[x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\]

The original polynomial can now be factored as:
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 4x + 7\). We can use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 7\).

\[x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 28}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 2i\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \pm i\sqrt{3}.\]

The roots of the quadratic polynomial are complex, so the only integer roots of the original polynomial are \(x = 1\) and \(x = -2\).

This implies that the number of students is a number that does not have a common divisor with any integer greater than 1, other than 1, in the range of 30 to 50. Additionally, when 2 is added to this number (Betty and Wilma), the resulting number also does not have a common divisor with any integer greater than 1, other than 1.

We need to check which of these prime numbers, when 2 is added, results in another number that is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself (i.e., another prime number).

The problem involves finding the cost of making a 3-inch cube, given the costs of making 1-inch and 2-inch cubes. The cost of the paint is proportional to the surface area of the cube, and the cost of the concrete is proportional to the volume of the cube.

Let's denote the cost of the concrete per unit volume as $k_1$ and the cost of the paint per unit area as $k_2$. The volume of a cube with side length $s$ is $s^3$, and the surface area is $6s^2$.

The cost of making a cube of side length $s$ can be expressed as:
\[ C(s) = k_1 s^3 + k_2 \cdot 6s^2 = k_1 s^3 + 6k_2 s^2 \]

We are given:
\[ C(1) = k_1 \cdot 1^3 + 6k_2 \cdot 1^2 = k_1 + 6k_2 = 1.30 \]
\[ C(2) = k_1 \cdot 2^3 + 6k_2 \cdot 2^2 = 8k_1 + 24k_2 = 6.80 \]

We need to solve these equations to find the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We have the system of linear equations:
\[ k_1 + 6k_2 = 1.30 \]
\[ 8k_1 + 24k_2 = 6.80 \]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$. First, we can multiply the first equation by 8 to align the coefficients of $k_1$:
\[ 8k_1 + 48k_2 = 10.40 \]
\[ 8k_1 + 24k_2 = 6.80 \]

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (8k_1 + 48k_2) - (8k_1 + 24k_2) = 10.40 - 6.80 \]
\[ 24k_2 = 3.60 \]
\[ k_2 = \frac{3.60}{24} = 0.15 \]

Now, substitute $k_2 = 0.15$ into the first equation:
\[ k_1 + 6(0.15) = 1.30 \]
\[ k_1 + 0.90 = 1.30 \]
\[ k_1 = 1.30 - 0.90 = 0.40 \]

So, we have $k_1 = 0.40$ and $k_2 = 0.15$. Now, we can find the cost of making a 3-inch cube:
\[ C(3) = k_1 \cdot 3^3 + 6k_2 \cdot 3^2 = 0.40 \cdot 27 + 6 \cdot 0.15 \cdot 9 \]

\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle P - \angle Q = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 35^\circ = 105^\circ.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the function \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the function \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).

To find the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero, we solve the equation $x^2-9=0$. This is a quadratic equation, and it can be factored as $(x-3)(x+3)=0$.

2. $\log_y 5x = 2$

We need to use properties of logarithms to simplify and solve these equations.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\log_b a + \log_b c = \log_b (ac)$ to simplify the first equation:
\[
\log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = \log_6 ((x-y)(x+y)) = \log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2
\]
This implies:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36
\]
So, we have the equation:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 36 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we can rewrite the second equation in exponential form:
\[
\log_y 5x = 2 \implies y^2 = 5x \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. $x^2 - y^2 = 36$
2. $y^2 = 5x$

We can substitute the expression for $y^2$ from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x = 36
\]
This simplifies to a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0$ by factoring:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0
\]
This gives us two possible solutions for $x$:
\[
x - 9 = 0 \implies x = 9
\]
or
\[
x + 4 = 0 \implies x = -4
\]

Since $x$ is part of a logarithmic expression in the original equations, it must be positive. Therefore, we discard the negative solution $x = -4$ and keep only the positive solution $x = 9$.

Next action: [VERIFY]

[VERIFY]

We have found that $x = 9$ is the potential solution. We need to verify that this value satisfies both original equations.

First, we substitute $x = 9$ into the equation $y^2 = 5x$ to find $y$:
\[
y^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \implies y = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]
We need to check if $x = 9$ and $y = 3\sqrt{5}$ satisfy the first equation:
\[
\log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = \log_6 (9 - 3\sqrt{5}) + \log_6 (9 + 3\sqrt{5}) = \log_6 ((9 - 3\sqrt{5})(9 + 3\sqrt{5})) = \log_6 (81 - 45) = \log_6 36 = 2
\]
This confirms that $x = 9$ and $y = 3\sqrt{5}$ satisfy the first equation.

Next, we check the second equation:
\[
\log_y 5x = \log_{3\sqrt{5}} (5 \cdot 9) = \log_{3\sqrt{5}} 45
\]
We need to verify if this equals 2:
\[
\log_{3\sqrt{5}} 45 = 2 \implies (3\sqrt{5})^2 = 45 \implies 45 = 45
\]
This confirms that $x = 9$ and $y = 3\sqrt{5}$ satisfy the second equation.

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies both equations is indeed $x = 9$.

z = e^{i \pi (1 + 2k) / 9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8.
\]
This gives us the roots:
\[
z = e^{i \pi (1 + 2k) / 9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8.
\]
However, we need to exclude the root $z = -1$, which corresponds to $k = 4$ (since $e^{i \pi (1 + 8) / 9} = e^{i \pi} = -1$).

[ADVANCE]

The possible values of $\theta$ are:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi (1 + 2k)}{9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8, \quad k \neq 4.
\]
We need to find the sum of these values of $\theta$:
\[
\sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^8 \frac{\pi (1 + 2k)}{9}.
\]
This can be split into two sums:
\[
\frac{\pi}{9} \left( \sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^8 1 + 2 \sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^8 k \right).
\]
The first sum is the number of terms, which is 9 - 1 = 8:
\[
\sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^8 1 = 8.
\]
The second sum is the sum of the first 9 positive integers minus the term corresponding to $k=4$:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^8 k = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36, \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^8 k = 36 - 4 = 32.
\]
So, the sum of the values of $\theta$ is:
\[
\frac{\pi}{9} \left( 8 + 2 \cdot 32 \right) = \frac{\pi}{9} \left( 8 + 64 \right) = \frac{\pi}{9} \cdot 72 = 8\pi.
\]

The problem presents a diagram of a shaded triangle within a rectangle. The rectangle has dimensions of 10 cm by 3 cm. The shaded triangle's vertices are at the points where the rectangle's sides intersect with the triangle's sides.

To find the area of the shaded triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

We need to identify the base and height of the triangle to apply this formula.

[ADVANCE]

The base of the shaded triangle is the same as the length of the rectangle, which is 10 cm. The height of the shaded triangle is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 3 cm.

Now, we can substitute the base and height into the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 3 \]

Calculate the area:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \]

So, the area of the shaded triangle is 15 square centimeters.

The area of the shaded triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. Given the base and height of the triangle are 10 cm and 3 cm respectively, the area is:

We are given that $a + b + c + d = 10$ and we need to find the maximum value of $ab^2 c^3 d^4.$ This is a problem that can be approached using the method of Lagrange multipliers or the AM-GM inequality. Given the form of the expression we want to maximize, AM-GM inequality seems like a suitable choice.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value of $ab^2 c^3 d^4.$ The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n,$

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}.
\]

We can rewrite $a + b + c + d$ as a sum of terms that will allow us to use the given expression $ab^2 c^3 d^4.$ Since the exponents of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ in the expression $ab^2 c^3 d^4$ are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, we can split the sum $a + b + c + d$ into parts that reflect these exponents. We can write:

\[
a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} = 10.
\]

This gives us 10 terms, which we can now apply the AM-GM inequality to:

\[
\frac{a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4}}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{a \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{c}{3} \cdot \frac{c}{3} \cdot \frac{c}{3} \cdot \frac{d}{4} \cdot \frac{d}{4} \cdot \frac{d}{4} \cdot \frac{d}{4}}.
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
\frac{10}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{\frac{a b^2 c^3 d^4}{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4}}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\1 \geq \sqrt[10]{\frac{a b^2 c^3 d^4}{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4}}.

Raising both sides to the power of 10, we get:

\1 \geq \frac{a b^2 c^3 d^4}{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4}.

So,

\ a b^2 c^3 d^4 \leq 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4.

Calculating the right-hand side, we have:

\ a b^2 c^3 d^4 \leq 4 \cdot 27 \cdot 256 = 27648.

The maximum value of $ab^2 c^3 d^4$ is achieved when the equality holds in the AM-GM inequality, which occurs when $a = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{3} = \frac{d}{4}.$ Let's solve for $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ under the constraint $a + b + c + d = 10.$

If $a = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{3} = \frac{d}{4} = k,$ then $a = k,$ $b = 2k,$ $c = 3k,$ and $d = 4k.$ Substituting these into the constraint $a + b + c + d = 10,$ we get:

\k + 2k + 3k + 4k = 10,

\10k = 10,

\k = 1.

So, $a = 1,$ $b = 2,$ $c = 3,$ and $d = 4.$ We can verify that this satisfies the original constraint and gives us the maximum value of $ab^2 c^3 d^4.$

Therefore, the maximum value of $ab^2 c^3 d^4$ is $\boxed{27648}.$

To find the class average, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the total number of students. The total sum of the scores can be calculated as follows:

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the distance, we need to multiply the speed (50 miles per hour) by the time ($2\frac{3}{4}$ hours). First, we convert the mixed number $2\frac{3}{4}$ to an improper fraction: $2\frac{3}{4} = \frac{2 \times 4 + 3}{4} = \frac{11}{4}$.

Now, we can calculate the distance:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that $\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}$ for any positive $c \neq 1$. By applying this formula, we can rewrite each term in the product with a common base, such as base 2.

\[
\log_2{3} = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}}, \quad \log_3{4} = \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}}, \quad \log_4{5} = \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}, \quad \log_5{6} = \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}}, \quad \log_6{7} = \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}}, \quad \log_7{8} = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}
\]

Next, we can substitute these expressions into the original product:

\[
\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8} = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \cdot \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} \cdot \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}} \cdot \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}} \cdot \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}} \cdot \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}

We can simplify the product by canceling out the common terms in the numerators and denominators:

Since $8 = 2^3$, we can rewrite $\log{8}$ as $\log{2^3} = 3\log{2}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

The problem involves an unfair six-sided die with specific probability constraints. We need to find the probability of obtaining a certain face $F$ and then use this information to calculate the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 when two such dice are rolled.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the probability of obtaining face $F$ as $p$, and the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ as $q$. Since the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $\frac{1}{6}$, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the probabilities of all faces is 1:
\[ p + q + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 1 \]
\[ p + q + \frac{2}{3} = 1 \]
\[ p + q = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $\frac{1}{6}$:
\[ p > \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ q < \frac{1}{6} \]

3. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $\frac{47}{288}$. The pairs of faces that sum to 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). Since the face opposite face $F$ has a probability $q$, and the other faces have a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$, we can calculate the probability of obtaining a sum of 7.

Let's assume face $F$ is face 1, then the face opposite face $F$ is face 6. The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is:
\[ P(\text{sum of 7}) = P(1,6) + P(6,1) + P(2,5) + P(5,2) + P(3,4) + P(4,3) \]
\[ = p \cdot q + q \cdot p + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ = 2pq + \frac{4}{36} \]
\[ = 2pq + \frac{1}{9} \]
Given that this probability is $\frac{47}{288}$, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2pq + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288} \]
\[ 2pq = \frac{47}{288} - \frac{1}{9} \]
\[ 2pq = \frac{47}{288} - \frac{32}{288} \]
\[ 2pq = \frac{15}{288} \]
\[ pq = \frac{15}{576} \]
\[ pq = \frac{5}{192} \]

We also have the equation $p + q = \frac{1}{3}$. We can solve these two equations to find the values of $p$ and $q$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $q$ in terms of $p$ from the equation $p + q = \frac{1}{3}$:
\[ q = \frac{1}{3} - p \]
Substitute this into the equation $pq = \frac{5}{192}$:
\[ p \left( \frac{1}{3} - p \right) = \frac{5}{192} \]
\[ \frac{p}{3} - p^2 = \frac{5}{192} \]
\[ -p^2 + \frac{p}{3} - \frac{5}{192} = 0 \]
Multiply through by -192 to clear the denominators:
\[ 192p^2 - 64p + 5 = 0 \]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 192$, $b = -64$, and $c = 5$:
\[ p = \frac{-(-64) \pm \sqrt{(-64)^2 - 4 \cdot 192 \cdot 5}}{2 \cdot 192} \]
\[ p = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{4096 - 3840}}{384} \]
\[ p = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{256}}{384} \]
\[ p = \frac{64 \pm 16}{384} \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ p = \frac{64 + 16}{384} = \frac{80}{384} = \frac{5}{24} \]
\[ p = \frac{64 - 16}{384} = \frac{48}{384} = \frac{1}{8} \]
Since $p > \frac{1}{6}$, we take $p = \frac{5}{24}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the probability of obtaining face $F$ as $p = \frac{5}{24}$, we can find the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ as $q = \frac{1}{3} - p = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{24} = \frac{8}{24} - \frac{5}{24} = \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8}$, which is less than $\frac{1}{6}$, satisfying the given conditions.

Since \( y = x^2 \), we have \( x = \pm \sqrt{y} \). The original equation is a quartic equation in terms of \( x \), but the substitution reduces it to a more manageable form in terms of \( y \).

The numerator of the left-hand side is a polynomial of degree 3, and the denominator is a polynomial of degree 4. The right-hand side is a linear term in \( x \). To find the sum of the roots of the original equation, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial equation is related to the coefficients of the polynomial.

Let's rewrite the equation as:
\[P(y) = (2010x - 4)(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)(y-4),\]
where \( P(y) \) is the polynomial obtained by cross-multiplying and expanding the left-hand side.

Since \( y = x^2 \), the roots of the equation in terms of \( y \) will be \( y = a^2 \) where \( a \) is a root of the original equation. The sum of the roots of the original equation in terms of \( x \) will be the sum of the square roots of the roots of the equation in terms of \( y \).

However, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of the polynomial equation. The sum of the roots of the polynomial equation in terms of \( y \) will be the sum of the roots of the quartic equation, which can be found from the coefficient of the \( y^3 \) term.

Multiplying through by the common denominator \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) will yield a polynomial equation of degree 8.

The sum of the roots of the polynomial equation can be found using Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots of the polynomial equation will be the sum of the roots of the form \( \pm \sqrt{y_i} \), where \( y_i \) are the roots of the quartic equation in terms of \( y \).

Since the polynomial equation is of degree 8, and the coefficients of the polynomial are real, the non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs. The sum of the roots of the form \( \pm \sqrt{y_i} \) will be zero, as the positive and negative roots will cancel each other out.

Since $8 = 2^3$, the only prime $p$ that does not satisfy $\gcd(8, p) = 1$ is $p = 2$. For $p = 2$, the congruence $8x \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ simplifies to $0 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$, which has no solutions.

Therefore, the only prime $p$ for which the congruence $8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ has no solutions is $p = 2$.

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1.$ We need to find all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i.$ Note that $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$ can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$ Since $\omega \neq 1,$ we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression. Let's calculate $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

We can find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.\]
Since $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ we can substitute these values into the expression:
\[\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + (\omega + \omega^2)}{2 + (\omega + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.\]

The problem requires simplifying a complex expression involving products of terms of the form $k^4 + \frac{1}{4}$, where $k$ takes on different values in the numerator and denominator.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's examine the general term $k^4 + \frac{1}{4}$ and try to factor it. We can use the Sophie Germain identity, which states that $a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)$. By setting $a = k$ and $b = \frac{1}{2}$, we get:

\[k^4 + \frac{1}{4} = k^4 + 4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = k^4 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = k^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \left(k^2 + 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 2k \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(k^2 + 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 2k \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(k^2 + \frac{1}{2} + k\right)\left(k^2 + \frac{1}{2} - k\right) = \left(k^2 + k + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(k^2 - k + \frac{1}{2}\right).\]

So, the expression can be rewritten as:

\[\frac{(2^4 + \frac{1}{4})(4^4 + \frac{1}{4}) \dotsm [(2n)^4 + \frac{1}{4}]}{(1^4 + \frac{1}{4})(3^4 + \frac{1}{4}) \dotsm [(2n - 1)^4 + \frac{1}{4}]} = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left((2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\right)}{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left((2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\right)} = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(4k^2 + 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left((2k-1)^2 + (2k-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left((2k-1)^2 - (2k-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)}.\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, let's simplify the terms further. For the numerator, we have:

\[(2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \left(4k^2 + 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(2k\left(2k + 1\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2k\left(2k - 1\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right).\]

For the denominator, we have:

\[(2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \left((2k-1)^2 + (2k-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left((2k-1)^2 - (2k-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left((2k-1)\left(2k\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left((2k-1)\left(2k-2\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right).\]

By examining the pattern, we can see that the terms will telescope. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern:

Numerator: $\left(2\cdot1\cdot2 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2\cdot1\cdot0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(2\cdot2\cdot3 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2\cdot2\cdot1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \dotsm \left(2n(2n+1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2n(2n-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)$.

Denominator: $\left(1\cdot2 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1\cdot0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(3\cdot4 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(3\cdot2 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \dotsm \left((2n-1)2n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left((2n-1)(2n-2) + \frac{1}{2}\right)$.

We can see that most terms will cancel out, leaving us with:

\[\frac{\left(2n(2n+1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2n(2n-1) + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\left(4n^2 + 2n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4n^2 - 2n + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2\left(4n^2 + 2n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4n^2 - 2n + \frac{1}{2}\right).\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the telescoping pattern more carefully. The correct simplification after telescoping the terms will lead us to:

\[\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(4k^2 + 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(4k^2 - 4k + \frac{5}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 2k + \frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{4n^2 + 2n + \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{8n^2 + 4n + 1}{1} = (2n+1)^2.\]

So, the simplified expression is:

\[\boxed{(2n+1)^2}.\]

The problem requires finding the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal. To solve this, we need to understand the conditions for a fraction to have a terminating decimal. A fraction in its simplest form has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator (after simplifying) has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.

Since we are dealing with the reciprocals of odd integers, the denominator will only have the prime factor 5 if the odd integer itself is a power of 5 or a product of 5 and other odd integers that do not introduce any prime factors other than 5 when the reciprocal is expressed as a fraction.

Next, we need to identify all the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5 or multiples of powers of 5 and no other prime factors that would prevent the reciprocal from having a terminating decimal.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's list the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5:
\[5^1 = 5, 5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125, 5^4 = 625, 5^5 = 3125\]
Since $5^5 = 3125$ is greater than 2010, we consider only up to $5^4 = 625$. So, the odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5 are 5, 25, 125, and 625.

Next, we need to consider the odd integers that are multiples of these powers of 5 and no other prime factors. These would be the odd integers of the form $5^k \cdot m$ where $m$ is an odd integer consisting only of prime factors other than 5, but since we are looking for terminating decimals, $m$ must be 1 (i.e., the integer must be a power of 5 or a product of powers of 5 and no other primes).

So, the odd integers less than 2010 that meet the condition are indeed just the powers of 5: 5, 25, 125, and 625.

Now, we need to count the total number of odd integers less than 2010. The odd integers less than 2010 are 1, 3, 5, ..., 2009, which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1 and the last term 2009, and a common difference of 2. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Number of terms} = \frac{2009 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1005
\]
So, there are 1005 odd integers less than 2010.

The probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal is the number of favorable outcomes (4) divided by the total number of outcomes (1005):
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{4}{1005}
\]
Since 4 and 1005 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Finally, we need to find $a + b$:
\[
a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009
\]

We then calculated the total number of odd integers less than 2010, which is 1005. The probability is $\frac{4}{1005}$, and since 4 and 1005 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, $a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009$.

The problem provides a unique expression for the area of triangle $ABC$ and asks for the value of $\tan A$. We need to relate the given area expression to the standard formula for the area of a triangle and use trigonometric identities to find $\tan A$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of triangle $ABC$ is given by $a^2 - (b - c)^2$. We can expand this expression to get:
\[ \text{Area} = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2. \]
The standard formula for the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A$. We can equate the two expressions for the area:
\[ \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2. \]
We also know the Law of Cosines, which states that $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A$. We can rearrange this to express $a^2 - b^2 - c^2$ in terms of $\cos A$:
\[ a^2 - b^2 - c^2 = -2bc \cos A. \]
Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = -2bc \cos A + 2bc. \]
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $\frac{1}{2}bc$:
\[ \sin A = -4 \cos A + 4. \]
We can express $\sin A$ in terms of $\tan A$ by dividing both sides by $\cos A$:
\[ \tan A = -4 + \frac{4}{\cos A}. \]
We also know that $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$. We can substitute $\sin A = \tan A \cos A$ into this equation:
\[ (\tan A \cos A)^2 + \cos^2 A = 1. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \tan^2 A \cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1. \]
Factoring out $\cos^2 A$, we get:
\[ \cos^2 A (\tan^2 A + 1) = 1. \]
Since $\tan A = -4 + \frac{4}{\cos A}$, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ \cos^2 A \left((-4 + \frac{4}{\cos A})^2 + 1\right) = 1. \]
Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ \cos^2 A \left(16 - \frac{32}{\cos A} + \frac{16}{\cos^2 A} + 1\right) = 1. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \cos^2 A \left(17 - \frac{32}{\cos A} + \frac{16}{\cos^2 A}\right) = 1. \]
Multiplying through by $\cos^2 A$, we get:
\[ 17 \cos^4 A - 32 \cos^3 A + 16 \cos^2 A = 1. \]
This is a quartic equation in terms of $\cos A$. However, we can use the relationship $\tan A = -4 + \frac{4}{\cos A}$ to find a simpler solution.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$ and the equation $\sin A = -4 \cos A + 4$ to find $\tan A$ directly. We substitute $\sin A = -4 \cos A + 4$ into $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$:
\[ \tan A = \frac{-4 \cos A + 4}{\cos A} = -4 + \frac{4}{\cos A}. \]
We also know that $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$. Substituting $\sin A = -4 \cos A + 4$ into this equation, we get:
\[ (-4 \cos A + 4)^2 + \cos^2 A = 1. \]
Expanding this equation, we get:
\[ 16 \cos^2 A - 32 \cos A + 16 + \cos^2 A = 1. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 17 \cos^2 A - 32 \cos A + 15 = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $\cos A$. We can solve for $\cos A$ using the quadratic formula:
\[ \cos A = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where $a = 17$, $b = -32$, and $c = 15$. Substituting these values, we get:
\[ \cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15}}{2 \cdot 17} = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34} = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{4}}{34} = \frac{32 \pm 2}{34}. \]
So, we have two possible solutions for $\cos A$:
\[ \cos A = \frac{32 + 2}{34} = \frac{34}{34} = 1, \]
or
\[ \cos A = \frac{32 - 2}{34} = \frac{30}{34} = \frac{15}{17}. \]
Since $\cos A = 1$ would imply $\sin A = 0$, which is not possible given the original area expression, we discard this solution. Therefore, $\cos A = \frac{15}{17}$.
Substituting $\cos A = \frac{15}{17}$ into the equation $\tan A = -4 + \frac{4}{\cos A}$, we get:
\[ \tan A = -4 + \frac{4}{\frac{15}{17}} = -4 + \frac{68}{15} = \frac{-60 + 68}{15} = \frac{8}{15}. \]

Let's denote \(a = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}}\) and \(b = \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}}\). The given equation becomes \(a + b = 6\).

\[a^2 = x + \sqrt{3x + 6}\]
\[b^2 = x - \sqrt{3x + 6}\]

Adding these two equations, we get:
\[a^2 + b^2 = (x + \sqrt{3x + 6}) + (x - \sqrt{3x + 6}) = 2x\]

Since \(a + b = 6\), we can square this equation to get:
\[(a + b)^2 = 36\]
\[a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 36\]

Substituting \(a^2 + b^2 = 2x\) into the equation, we get:
\[2x + 2ab = 36\]
\[x + ab = 18\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(ab\). Multiplying the expressions for \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), we get:
\[a^2b^2 = (x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6}) = x^2 - (3x + 6) = x^2 - 3x - 6\]
\[ab = \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6}\]

Substituting \(ab = \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6}\) into the equation \(x + ab = 18\), we get:
\[x + \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18\]
\[\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18 - x\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[x^2 - 3x - 6 = (18 - x)^2 = 324 - 36x + x^2\]

\[= \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{36}} = \sqrt{10 + 6} + \sqrt{10 - 6} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{4} = 4 + 2 = 6\]

[ADVANCE]

Since \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we can simplify the expression for \( f(x) \) by evaluating the absolute values within this interval. Specifically:
- For \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), \( |x-p| = x-p \) because \( x \geq p \).
- For \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), \( |x-15| = 15-x \) because \( x \leq 15 \).
- For \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), \( |x-p-15| = 15 + p - x \) because \( x-p-15 \leq 0 \) (since \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \)).

To find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints of the interval, since \( f(x) = 30 - x \) is a linear function and its minimum value over a closed interval will occur at one of the endpoints.

- At \( x = p \), \( f(p) = 30 - p \).
- At \( x = 15 \), \( f(15) = 30 - 15 = 15 \).

Since \( 0 < p < 15 \), it is clear that \( 30 - p > 15 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \) is \( 15 \).

We are given a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. The leading coefficient $a_n$ is 2, and the constant term $a_0$ is 66. We need to find the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$.

[ADVANCE]

Given that the polynomial has distinct integer roots and the leading coefficient is 2, we can express the polynomial as:
\[ f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_n) \]
where $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$ are the distinct integer roots of the polynomial. The constant term $a_0$ is given by:
\[ a_0 = 2(-r_1)(-r_2) \cdots (-r_n) = 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = 66 \]
This implies:
\[ (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = 33 \]
The integer 33 can be factored into distinct integers in several ways. We need to consider the factorizations of 33 to find the combination that minimizes the sum of the roots, since $a_{n-1}$ is related to the sum of the roots by Vieta's formulas:
\[ a_{n-1} = 2 \left( \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \right) \]
We will explore the factorizations of 33 to find the appropriate roots.

[ADVANCE]

The factorizations of 33 into distinct integers are:
\[ 33 = 33 \times 1 \]
\[ 33 = 11 \times 3 \]
\[ 33 = (-33) \times (-1) \]
\[ 33 = (-11) \times (-3) \]
\[ 33 = 33 \times (-1) \times (-1) \] (not distinct)
\[ 33 = 11 \times 3 \times (-1) \times (-1) \] (not distinct)
We need to consider the factorizations with the smallest number of factors, as they are more likely to yield the minimum sum of roots.

Considering the factorization $33 = 11 \times 3$, we can have the roots as $\pm 1, \pm 11, \pm 3$. We need to check the possible combinations to satisfy $(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = 33$.

If we choose the roots as $1, -11, 3$, then:
\[ (-1)^n (1)(-11)(3) = 33 \implies (-1)^n = -1 \implies n \text{ is odd} \]
The sum of the roots is:
\[ 1 + (-11) + 3 = -7 \]
Thus, $a_{n-1} = 2(-7) = -14$ and $|a_{n-1}| = 14$.

If we choose the roots as $-1, 11, -3$, then:
\[ (-1)^n (-1)(11)(-3) = 33 \implies (-1)^n = 1 \implies n \text{ is even} \]
The sum of the roots is:
\[ -1 + 11 + (-3) = 7 \]
Thus, $a_{n-1} = 2(7) = 14$ and $|a_{n-1}| = 14$.

We need to check if there are any other combinations of roots that could yield a smaller $|a_{n-1}|$.

Considering the factorization $33 = 33 \times 1$, we can have the roots as $\pm 1, \pm 33$. We need to check the possible combinations to satisfy $(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = 33$.

If we choose the roots as $1, -33$, then:
\[ (-1)^n (1)(-33) = 33 \implies (-1)^n = -1 \implies n \text{ is odd} \]
The sum of the roots is:
\[ 1 + (-33) = -32 \]
Thus, $a_{n-1} = 2(-32) = -64$ and $|a_{n-1}| = 64$.

If we choose the roots as $-1, 33$, then:
\[ (-1)^n (-1)(33) = 33 \implies (-1)^n = 1 \implies n \text{ is even} \]
The sum of the roots is:
\[ -1 + 33 = 32 \]
Thus, $a_{n-1} = 2(32) = 64$ and $|a_{n-1}| = 64$.

We have considered the possible factorizations of 33 and the corresponding roots. The smallest value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is 14.

The problem involves finding the set of vectors $\mathbf{v}$ such that the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is the zero vector. This implies that $\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

[ADVANCE]

Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$. The projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Since we are given that this projection is the zero vector, the dot product $\mathbf{v} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ must be zero. Therefore, we have:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 2x + y = 0

The problem requires expanding the expression $(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3$ and expressing it in the form $a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{6}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. We need to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and then calculate $a+b+c$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To expand $(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3$, we can use the binomial theorem, which states that $(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$. Here, $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $y = \sqrt{3}$. Applying the binomial theorem, we get:
\[
(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3 = (\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\sqrt{2})^2(\sqrt{3}) + 3(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{3})^3
\]
Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
(\sqrt{2})^3 = 2\sqrt{2}, \quad 3(\sqrt{2})^2(\sqrt{3}) = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}, \quad 3(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 = 9\sqrt{2}, \quad (\sqrt{3})^3 = 3\sqrt{3}
\]
Combining these terms, we get:
\[
(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3 = 2\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} + 9\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{3} = (2\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{2}) + (6\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{3}) = 11\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{3}
\]
However, we notice that there is no $\sqrt{6}$ term in the expansion. This means that the coefficient of $\sqrt{6}$ is 0. Therefore, we can write:
\[
(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3 = 11\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{3} + 0\sqrt{6}

The problem asks for the area of the set $S$ of points $(a,b)$ with $0 \le a,$ $b \le 1$ such that the equation $x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0$ has at least one real root.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the set $S$, we need to analyze the given polynomial equation $x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0$. We can start by considering the possible real roots of the polynomial. Let's assume $x$ is a real root of the polynomial.

We can rewrite the polynomial equation as:
\[x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0.\]

If $x = 0$, the equation becomes $1 = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $x \neq 0$. We can divide the equation by $x^2$ to get:
\[x^2 + ax - b + \frac{a}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} + ax + \frac{a}{x} - b = 0.\]

We can use the substitution $y = x + \frac{1}{x}$. Then, $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$, so $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[y^2 - 2 + ay - b = 0.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation in $y$:
\[y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0.\]

For the original polynomial to have a real root, this quadratic equation must have a real root $y$ such that $y = x + \frac{1}{x}$. We know that $y = x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$ if $x > 0$ and $y = x + \frac{1}{x} \le -2$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the quadratic equation must have a real root $y$ such that $|y| \ge 2$.

The quadratic equation $y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0$ has real roots if its discriminant is non-negative:
\[a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge 0,\]
which simplifies to:
\[a^2 + 4b + 8 \ge 0.\]

This inequality is always true for $0 \le a, b \le 1$, so we need to consider the condition $|y| \ge 2$. The roots of the quadratic equation are:
\[y = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}.\]

We need to find the conditions on $a$ and $b$ such that at least one of the roots satisfies $|y| \ge 2$. We will consider the cases $y \ge 2$ and $y \le -2$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's consider the case $y \ge 2$. We have:
\[\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 2 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{-a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 2.\]

For the first inequality, we get:
\[-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4,\]
\[\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 + a,\]
\[a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge (4 + a)^2,\]
\[a^2 + 4b + 8 \ge 16 + 8a + a^2,\]
\[4b \ge 8 + 8a,\]
\[b \ge 2 + 2a.\]

Since $0 \le a, b \le 1$, the inequality $b \ge 2 + 2a$ is not satisfied for any $a$ and $b$ in the given range. Therefore, we discard this case.

Now, let's consider the case $y \le -2$. We have:
\[\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \le -2 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{-a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \le -2.\]

For the first inequality, we get:
\[-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \le -4,\]
\[\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \le -4 + a.\]

Since the left-hand side is non-negative, the right-hand side must be non-negative, so $-4 + a \ge 0$, which implies $a \ge 4$. However, this is not possible since $0 \le a \le 1$. Therefore, we discard this subcase.

For the second inequality, we get:
\[-a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \le -4,\]
\[-\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \le -4 + a,\]
\[\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 - a,\]
\[a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge (4 - a)^2,\]
\[a^2 + 4b + 8 \ge 16 - 8a + a^2,\]
\[4b \ge 8 - 8a,\]
\[b \ge 2 - 2a.\]

The inequality $b \ge 2 - 2a$ defines a region in the $ab$-plane. We need to find the area of this region within the unit square $0 \le a, b \le 1$.

The line $b = 2 - 2a$ intersects the $a$-axis at $a = 1$ and the $b$-axis at $b = 2$. However, we are only interested in the part of the line within the unit square. The line $b = 2 - 2a$ intersects the boundary of the unit square at $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$.

The region defined by $b \ge 2 - 2a$ within the unit square is a triangle with vertices $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, 1)$. The area of this triangle is:

[ADVANCE]

1. The expression inside the inner logarithm must be positive: $x-2 > 0 \implies x > 2$.
2. The argument of the outer logarithm must also be positive: $2 - \log(x-2) > 0 \implies \log(x-2) < 2 \implies x-2 < 10^2 \implies x-2 < 100 \implies x < 102$.

First, we need to substitute \( z = 1 + i \) into the expression for \( w \):

To find the magnitude of \( w \), we can use the property that the magnitude of a quotient of two complex numbers is the quotient of their magnitudes. Therefore, we need to find the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator.

The magnitude of the numerator \( 4 + 3i \) is:
\[ |4 + 3i| = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5. \]

The magnitude of the denominator \( 12 + 5i \) is:
\[ |12 + 5i| = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13. \]

An equiangular octagon can be divided into rectangles and right triangles. We can use the fact that the octagon is equiangular to find the internal angles, which are all $135^\circ$. By extending the sides of the octagon, we can form a larger square with side length equal to the sum of the lengths of two consecutive sides of the octagon.

Let's consider the octagon $ABCDEFGH$ with sides $AB = 1$, $BC = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $CD = 1$, $DE = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $EF = 1$, $FG = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $GH = 1$, and $HA = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. We can extend the sides to form a square $PQRS$.

The side length of the square $PQRS$ is $1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}$. The area of the square is $\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

The area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the areas of the four right triangles formed by extending the sides. Each triangle has legs of length $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

The total area of the four triangles is $4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is $\frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2} - 2}{2} = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$. Given the recursive definition, we have:
\[a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1}.\]
Then, we can express $a_3$ as:
\[a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1}.\]
Since we are given that $a_3 = a_1$, we can set up the equation:
\[a_1 = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $a_1$, we get:
\[a_1^2 = a_1 - 1.\]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$:
\[a_1 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]
So, the possible values for $a_1$ are $\frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Now, we need to find the value of $a_9$. Since the sequence is defined recursively, we can calculate the next terms to see if there is a pattern. We already have $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3 = a_1$. Let's calculate $a_4$:
\[a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = a_2.\]
We observe that $a_4 = a_2$. Now, let's calculate $a_5$:
\[a_5 = \frac{1}{1 - a_4} = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = a_3 = a_1.\]
We see that $a_5 = a_1$. This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 2, i.e., $a_{n+2} = a_n$ for all $n \ge 1$. Therefore, we can express $a_9$ as:
\[a_9 = a_{2 \cdot 4 + 1} = a_1.\]
Since $a_9 = a_1$, we need to find $(a_1)^9$. We have two possible values for $a_1$: $\frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Let's calculate the ninth power of these complex numbers.

The complex numbers $\frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ can be written in polar form. The magnitude of both numbers is 1, and their arguments are $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{\pi}{3}$, respectively. Using De Moivre's theorem, we can find the ninth power:
\[\left(\frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^9 = \left(e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}\right)^9 = e^{i3\pi} = \cos 3\pi + i \sin 3\pi = -1.\]
\[\left(\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^9 = \left(e^{-i\frac{\pi}{3}}\right)^9 = e^{-i3\pi} = \cos (-3\pi) + i \sin (-3\pi) = -1.\]

\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 54^\circ - 52^\circ = 74^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the measure of $\angle AHB$. Notice that $\angle AHB$ is the supplement of $\angle ACB$ because $H$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$ (the intersection of the altitudes). Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 74^\circ = 106^\circ.
\]

[OUTPUT]

The measure of $\angle AHB$ is $\boxed{106^\circ}$.
