"To convert the Cartesian coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(r\)**:
   The formula for \(r\) in polar coordinates is given by:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   where \(x\) and \(y\) are the Cartesian coordinates. For the point \((0, 3)\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\theta\)**:
   The angle \(\theta\) can be found using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   For the point \((0, 3)\):
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
   \]
   Since \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. Therefore, \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

3. **Final Polar Coordinates**:
   Now we can express the polar coordinates as:
   \[
   (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2})
   \]

Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are:

"To find the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} \), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -2 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = 0 \) separately, and then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f(-2) \):
\[
f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2
\]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(-1) \):
\[
f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Then, let's evaluate \( f(0) \):
\[
f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1
\]

Now, we sum the values of \( f(-2) \), \( f(-1) \), and \( f(0) \):
\[
f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1
\]

To add these numbers, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2, \(\frac{5}{3}\), and 1 is 3. We convert 2 and 1 to fractions with a denominator of 3:
\[
2 = \frac{6}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 = \frac{3}{3}
\]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \frac{14}{3}
\]

Therefore, the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) is \(\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}\).","[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",\frac{14}{3},"[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",True

"To determine which student has the maximum average speed, we need to calculate the average speed for each student. The average speed is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

From the graph, the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents distance. The total distance each student ran is the y-coordinate of the point where their line intersects the y-axis, and the total time each student took is the x-coordinate of the point where their line intersects the x-axis.

Let's calculate the average speed for each student:

1. **Evelyn:**
   - Total distance: 4.5 units
   - Total time: 1.25 units
   - Average speed: \(\frac{4.5}{1.25} = 3.6\) units per unit time

   - Total distance: 5.2 units
   - Total time: 4.25 units
   - Average speed: \(\frac{5.2}{4.25} \approx 1.2235\) units per unit time

4. **Debra:**

   - Total time: 5.6 units
   - Average speed: \(\frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5\) units per unit time

5. **Angela:**
   - Total distance: 1.4 units
   - Total time: 6.8 units
   - Average speed: \(\frac{1.4}{6.8} \approx 0.2059\) units per unit time

"To find the angle between the two lines given by the equations \(2x = 3y = -z\) and \(6x = -y = -4z\), we first need to determine the direction vectors of these lines.

### Step 1: Find the direction vector of the first line
The equation \(2x = 3y = -z\) can be written in parametric form. Let \(2x = 3y = -z = t\). Then we have:
\[x = \frac{t}{2}, \quad y = \frac{t}{3}, \quad z = -t.\]
The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d_1} = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)\).

### Step 2: Find the direction vector of the second line
The equation \(6x = -y = -4z\) can also be written in parametric form. Let \(6x = -y = -4z = s\). Then we have:
\[x = \frac{s}{6}, \quad y = -s, \quad z = -\frac{s}{4}.\]
The direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)\).

### Step 3: Compute the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product \(\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)(-1) + (-1)\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = 0.
\]
Since the dot product is zero, the direction vectors are orthogonal, meaning the lines are perpendicular.

### Step 4: Determine the angle between the lines
The angle \(\theta\) between two lines is given by the angle between their direction vectors. Since the dot product is zero, the angle \(\theta\) is:
\[

Thus, the angle between the two lines is \(\boxed{90}\).","[90, '90']",90^\circ,"[90, '90']",True

"To find the sum of the true divisors of 284 and then the sum of the true divisors of that result, we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the true divisors of 284:**
   The true divisors of a number \( N \) are all the positive divisors of \( N \) except \( N \) itself. First, we need to find all the divisors of 284.

   - Start by checking for divisibility by small prime numbers:
     - \( 284 \) is even, so it is divisible by \( 2 \):
       \[
       284 \div 2 = 142
       \]
       So, \( 2 \) and \( 142 \) are divisors.
     - Check \( 142 \):
       - \( 142 \) is even, so it is divisible by \( 2 \):
         \[
         142 \div 2 = 71
         \]
         So, \( 2 \) and \( 71 \) are divisors.
     - Check \( 71 \):
       - \( 71 \) is a prime number.

   Therefore, the divisors of \( 284 \) are \( 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284 \). The true divisors (excluding \( 284 \) itself) are \( 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 \).

   - Sum of the true divisors of \( 284 \):
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220
     \]

2. **Find the true divisors of 220:**
   Now we need to find the true divisors of \( 220 \).

   - Start by checking for divisibility by small prime numbers:
     - \( 220 \) is even, so it is divisible by \( 2 \):
       \[
       220 \div 2 = 110
       \]
       So, \( 2 \) and \( 110 \) are divisors.
     - Check \( 110 \):
       - \( 110 \) is even, so it is divisible by \( 2 \):
         \[
         110 \div 2 = 55
         \]
         So, \( 2 \) and \( 55 \) are divisors.
     - Check \( 55 \):
       - \( 55 \) is divisible by \( 5 \):
         \[
         55 \div 5 = 11
         \]
         So, \( 5 \) and \( 11 \) are divisors.
     - Check \( 11 \):
       - \( 11 \) is a prime number.

   Therefore, the divisors of \( 220 \) are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, 220 \). The true divisors (excluding \( 220 \) itself) are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 \).

   - Sum of the true divisors of \( 220 \):
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
     \]

3. **Final Result:**
   The sum of the true divisors of \( 284 \) is \( 220 \), and the sum of the true divisors of \( 220 \) is \( 284 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
and
\[
EF = 7
\]
we can substitute these values into the equation to find \(DF\):
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6i\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{6i^2\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}) = 1 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2})i.

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (1 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2})i) + (2 - 3i) = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} + (-2 - 3\sqrt{2})i.

"To determine the minimum possible value of \( c \) for the function \( y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \) given its graph, we need to analyze the graph and identify the phase shift of the sine function.

The general form of the sine function is:
\[ y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \]
where:
- \( a \) is the amplitude,
- \( b \) affects the period,
- \( c \) is the phase shift,
- \( d \) is the vertical shift.

From the graph, we can observe the following:
1. The amplitude \( a \) is 2, as the maximum value of the function is 3 and the minimum value is -1, and the vertical shift \( d \) is 1 (since the midline of the function is \( y = 1 \)).
2. The period of the function is \( \frac{2\pi}{b} \). From the graph, we can see that the function completes one full cycle (from one peak to the next peak) over an interval of \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \). Therefore, \( b = 3 \).
3. The phase shift \( c \) can be determined by looking at the x-coordinate of the first peak (or the first point where the function reaches its maximum value). The first peak occurs at \( x = -\frac{\pi}{3} \).

The phase shift \( c \) is related to the x-coordinate of the first peak by the formula:
\[ bx + c = \frac{\pi}{2} \]
Substituting \( x = -\frac{\pi}{3} \) and \( b = 3 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ -\pi + c = \frac{\pi}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi \]
\[ c = \frac{3\pi}{2} \]

\[ c = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 2\pi = \frac{3\pi}{2} - \frac{4\pi}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{2} \]

   - \( AB = BC \).
   - The angle at \( A \) is \( 124^\circ \).

2. **Understand the geometric configuration:**
   - Since \(\overline{BC}\) is parallel to the line segment passing through \( A \), and \( AB = BC \), we have an isosceles triangle \( ABC \) with \( AB = BC \).
   - The angle at \( A \) is given as \( 124^\circ \).

3. **Calculate the angles in triangle \( ABC \):**
   - In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Let the base angles at \( B \) and \( C \) be \( \theta \).
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can write:

     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     124^\circ + 2\theta = 180^\circ

   - Solve for \( \theta \):
     \[
     2\theta = 180^\circ - 124^\circ

"To find the minimum possible value of \(a\) such that the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) has all real roots, we start by assuming that the roots of the polynomial are \(r, s, t\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
r + s + t = -a, \quad rs + rt + st = a, \quad rst = -1.
\]

We need to find the conditions under which these roots are all real. Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1\). We can use the derivative to find the critical points of \(P(x)\):

\[
P'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + a.
\]

For \(P(x)\) to have three real roots, \(P'(x)\) must have two real roots, and the values of \(P(x)\) at these critical points must have opposite signs. The discriminant of the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + 2ax + a = 0\) is:

\[
\Delta = (2a)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot a = 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3).

For \(P'(x)\) to have two real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative:

\[

This inequality holds when \(a \leq 0\) or \(a \geq 3\). Since \(a\) is a positive real number, we have \(a \geq 3\).

"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve an equation based on the given conditions. Let's denote the base reward per dog as \( r \).

First, we calculate the initial total rewards for Denali and Nate:
- Denali's initial reward: \( 16r \)
- Nate's initial reward: \( 12r \)

The initial ratio of Denali's reward to Nate's reward is:
\[
\frac{16r}{12r} = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, we consider the two scenarios given in the problem and set up the corresponding equations.

**Scenario 1: Denali starts多遛 \( 4x \) 只狗而 Nate 仍然负责 \( 12 \) 只狗.**

- Denali's new reward: \( (16 + 4x)r \)
- Nate's new reward: \( 12r \)

The new ratio of Denali's reward to Nate's reward is:
\[
\frac{(16 + 4x)r}{12r} = \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{4 + x}{3}
\]

Since this new ratio must be equal to the initial ratio, we have:
\[
\frac{4 + x}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 3:
\[
4 + x = 4
\]

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[
x = 0
\]

However, the problem states that \( x \neq 0 \), so this scenario does not provide a valid solution.

**Scenario 2: Nate's \( x \) 只狗被重新分配给 Denali.**

- Denali's new reward: \( (16 + x)r \)
- Nate's new reward: \( (12 - x)r \)

The new ratio of Denali's reward to Nate's reward is:
\[
\frac{(16 + x)r}{(12 - x)r} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x}
\]

Since this new ratio must be equal to the initial ratio, we have:
\[
\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[
3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
48 + 3x = 48 - 4x
\]

Adding \( 4x \) to both sides, we get:
\[
7x = 0
\]

Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get:
\[
7x = 0
\]

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
\[
x = 0
\]

However, the problem states that \( x \neq 0 \), so this scenario does not provide a valid solution.

Since neither scenario provides a valid solution, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the problem is not consistent with the given conditions, and there is no valid \( x \) that satisfies both scenarios simultaneously.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To solve the equation \( x = \sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the square root term:**
   \[
   x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x}
   \]

2. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**
   \[
   (x - 4)^2 = (\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x
   \]

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 8x + 16 + 2x - 11 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0

4. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   \[

   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 5 = 0
   \]
   So, the solutions are:
   \[
   x = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 5
   \]

6. **Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation:**

   - For \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     1 = \sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4
     \]
     Simplifying inside the square root:
     \[
     1 = \sqrt{9} + 4
     \]
     Since \(\sqrt{9} = 3\):
     \[
     1 = 3 + 4
     \]
     This is not true, so \( x = 1 \) is not a solution.

   - For \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     5 = \sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4

     Simplifying inside the square root:
     \[

     Since \(\sqrt{1} = 1\):
     \[
     5 = 1 + 4

     This is true, so \( x = 5 \) is a solution.

   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). For 7 people, this is:
   \[

2. **Calculate the number of ways to seat 7 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together.**
   Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 5 ""people"" (the block and the other 4 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange 5 ""people"" in a circle is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). First, we calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}

Combining these, we get:

"To solve the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation. Notice that \(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of cubes, which states that \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). Here, \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), so we have:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [(x - 3) + (x - 7)][(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = (2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2]
\]

Since \(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\), we can substitute this in:

\[
(2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2]
\]

Now, we equate this to the right-hand side of the original equation:

\[
2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

We can factor out \(x - 5\) from both sides of the equation:

\[
2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

If \(x - 5 \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x - 5\):

\[
2[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^2
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
\[
(x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49
\]
\[
(x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21
\]
\[
(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49) = x^2 - 10x + 37
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
2(x^2 - 10x + 37) = 8(x - 5)^2
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
8(x - 5)^2 = 8(x^2 - 10x + 25) = 8x^2 - 80x + 200
\]

Now, equate the two sides:

\[
2x^2 - 20x + 74 = 8x^2 - 80x + 200
\]

Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[
0 = 6x^2 - 60x + 126
\]

Divide the entire equation by 6:

\[
0 = x^2 - 10x + 21
\]

Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0
\]

So the solutions are:

\[
x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 7
\]

We also need to check the case when \(x - 5 = 0\), which gives \(x = 5\). Substituting \(x = 5\) into the original equation:

\[
(5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 - 8 = 0
\]
\[
(2 \cdot 5 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0

So \(x = 5\) is also a solution. Therefore, the roots of the equation are:

First, rewrite the expression in terms of distances between points in the coordinate plane:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (0-20)^2} = d((x, y), (0, 20)),
\]
\[
\sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (y-30)^2} = d((x, y), (0, 30)),

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2} = d((x, y), (40, 50)),
\]
where \(d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))\) is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).

Thus, the expression becomes the sum of the distances from the point \((x, y)\) to the points \((0, 20)\), \((0, 30)\), and \((40, 50)\):
\[

To minimize this sum of distances, we need to find the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the total distance to the three given points. This point is known as the Fermat point of the triangle formed by the points \((0, 20)\), \((0, 30)\), and \((40, 50)\).

For a triangle with all angles less than \(120^\circ\), the Fermat point is the point inside the triangle such that the angles formed between the lines connecting the Fermat point to the vertices of the triangle are all \(120^\circ\). However, in this case, we can check the vertices of the triangle and the sides to find the minimum distance.

First, calculate the distances between the points:

\[
d((0, 20), (40, 50)) = \sqrt{(40-0)^2 + (50-20)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50,

Since the angle between the sides \(d((0, 20), (0, 30))\) and \(d((0, 30), (40, 50))\) is less than \(120^\circ\), the Fermat point is not inside the triangle. Therefore, we check the vertices of the triangle.

1. At \((0, 20)\):
\[
d((0, 20), (0, 20)) + d((0, 20), (0, 30)) + d((0, 20), (40, 50)) = 0 + 10 + 50 = 60.

\[
d((0, 30), (0, 20)) + d((0, 30), (0, 30)) + d((0, 30), (40, 50)) = 10 + 0 + 20\sqrt{5} \approx 10 + 0 + 44.72 = 54.72.

"To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all roots of the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are \( n \)-th roots of unity, we start by solving the equation. Let \( w = z^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \):

\[ w^2 + w + 1 = 0. \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \):

\[ w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

So, the solutions for \( w \) are:

\[ w = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Next, we need to find the corresponding values of \( z \). Since \( w = z^2 \), we have:

\[ z^2 = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad z^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

We recognize that \( \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the non-real cube roots of unity, which can be written as \( e^{2\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{-2\pi i / 3} \), respectively. Therefore, the solutions for \( z \) are:

\[ z = \pm e^{\pi i / 3} \quad \text{and} \quad z = \pm e^{-\pi i / 3}. \]

These roots can be written as:

\[ z = e^{\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{5\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{7\pi i / 3}. \]

Since \( e^{7\pi i / 3} = e^{\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{5\pi i / 3} = e^{-\pi i / 3} \), the distinct roots are:

\[ z = e^{\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{5\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{7\pi i / 3}. \]

These roots are all 6th roots of unity because \( e^{2\pi i / 6} = e^{\pi i / 3} \), \( e^{-2\pi i / 6} = e^{-\pi i / 3} \), \( e^{10\pi i / 6} = e^{5\pi i / 3} \), and \( e^{14\pi i / 6} = e^{7\pi i / 3} \).

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[

This simplifies to:

First, let's recall the values of the sine function for some common angles:

\sin(0) = 0, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1.

Since we are looking for a negative value, we consider the negative angle corresponding to \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), which is \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\). We know that:

"To determine how many students participated in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( |B| \) be the number of students in the science club.
- Let \( |A \cup B| \) be the number of students who participated in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club or both.
- Let \( |A \cap B| \) be the number of students who participated in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of students in the class is \( |U| = 50 \).
- The number of students in MATHCOUNTS is \( |A| = 28 \).
- The number of students in the science club is \( |B| = 21 \).
- The number of students who do not participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club is 6. Therefore, the number of students who participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club or both is \( |A \cup B| = 50 - 6 = 44 \).

\]
holds, we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda_1 = 16 \).

The largest singular value of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):

"To find the constant \( d \) in the equation \((\sin x)^7 = a \sin 7x + b \sin 5x + c \sin 3x + d \sin x\), we can use the properties of the sine function and its multiple angles. Specifically, we can use the fact that the right-hand side of the equation is an odd function, and the left-hand side is also an odd function. This means that the coefficients of the sine terms on the right-hand side must match the coefficients of the sine terms on the left-hand side when expanded in terms of \(\sin x\).

First, let's expand \((\sin x)^7\) using the exponential form of the sine function. Recall that \(\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\). Therefore,
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \left( \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \right)^7 = \frac{1}{(2i)^7} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7.
\]
Next, we expand \((e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7\) using the binomial theorem:
\[
(e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{7}{k} (e^{ix})^{7-k} (-e^{-ix})^k = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{7}{k} (-1)^k e^{i(7-2k)x}.
\]
This sum can be written as:
\[
e^{7ix} - 7e^{5ix} + 21e^{3ix} - 35e^{ix} - 35e^{-ix} + 21e^{-3ix} - 7e^{-5ix} + e^{-7ix}.
\]
Combining the terms, we get:
\[
(e^{7ix} + e^{-7ix}) - 7(e^{5ix} + e^{-5ix}) + 21(e^{3ix} + e^{-3ix}) - 35(e^{ix} + e^{-ix}).
\]
Using the fact that \(e^{ix} + e^{-ix} = 2\cos x\), we can rewrite this as:
\[
2\cos 7x - 14\cos 5x + 42\cos 3x - 70\cos x.
\]
Therefore,
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (2\cos 7x - 14\cos 5x + 42\cos 3x - 70\cos x) = \frac{-1}{64i} (\cos 7x - 7\cos 5x + 21\cos 3x - 35\cos x).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right)\), we can express the cosine terms in terms of sine:
\[
\cos 7x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 7x \right), \quad \cos 5x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 5x \right), \quad \cos 3x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3x \right), \quad \cos x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the coefficients of the sine terms on the right-hand side must match the coefficients of the sine terms on the left-hand side. Since the left-hand side is an odd function, the coefficients of the sine terms on the right-hand side must be such that the sum of the coefficients of \(\sin 7x\), \(\sin 5x\), and \(\sin 3x\) is zero, and the coefficient of \(\sin x\) is the same as the coefficient of \((\sin x)^7\) when expanded in terms of \(\sin x\).

From the expansion, we see that the coefficient of \(\sin x\) is \(-\frac{35}{64i} \cdot 2i = -\frac{35}{32}\). Therefore, the coefficient \(d\) is:

We need to compute the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

"To determine the definition domain of the function \(\log x^2\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the logarithm. The logarithm function \(\log y\) is defined for \(y > 0\). Therefore, we need \(x^2 > 0\).

The inequality \(x^2 > 0\) holds for all real numbers except \(x = 0\). This is because the square of any non-zero real number is positive, and the square of zero is zero.

Given that the definition domain of the function \(\log x^2\) is \(x < a\) or \(x > b\), we can conclude that the only value of \(x\) that is excluded from the domain is \(x = 0\). Therefore, \(a\) and \(b\) must be such that \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\).

However, since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct values that define the intervals \(x < a\) and \(x > b\), we need to consider the correct interpretation. The correct interpretation is that \(a\) and \(b\) are the points where the function changes from being defined to undefined, which in this case is at \(x = 0\). Therefore, \(a\) and \(b\) are the same point, but we need to consider the intervals as \(x < 0\) and \(x > 0\).

Thus, \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\) are not distinct, but the intervals are \(x < 0\) and \(x > 0\). The sum \(a + b\) is:
\[

"To solve the equation \(2^8 = 4^x\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. We know that \(4\) can be written as a power of \(2\), specifically \(4 = 2^2\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right side of the equation as follows:

\[4^x = (2^2)^x\]

Using the property of exponents that \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the right side:

\[(2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\]

Now our equation looks like this:

\[2^8 = 2^{2x}\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[8 = 2x\]

To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:

"To find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) such that \(f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b)\) for the function \(f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1\), we start by expanding and comparing the expressions on both sides of the equation.

First, we expand the right-hand side:
\[
(x - a)^2 (x - b) = (x^2 - 2ax + a^2)(x - b) = x^3 - bx^2 - 2ax^2 + 2abx + a^2x - a^2b = x^3 + (-b - 2a)x^2 + (2ab + a^2)x - a^2b.
\]

Next, we expand the left-hand side:
\[
f(x) - f(a) = (x^3 + 3x^2 + 1) - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 1) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 - a^3 - 3a^2 - 1 = x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2.
\]

Now, we equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of \(x\) from both expanded forms:
\[
x^3 + (-b - 2a)x^2 + (2ab + a^2)x - a^2b = x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2.
\]

From this, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(-b - 2a = 3\),
2. \(2ab + a^2 = 0\),
3. \(-a^2b = -a^3 - 3a^2\).

We solve these equations step by step. From the second equation, we factor out \(a\):
\[
a(2b + a) = 0.
\]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we have:
\[
2b + a = 0 \implies a = -2b.
\]

We substitute \(a = -2b\) into the first equation:
\[
-b - 2(-2b) = 3 \implies -b + 4b = 3 \implies 3b = 3 \implies b = 1.
\]

Now, we substitute \(b = 1\) back into \(a = -2b\):
\[
a = -2(1) = -2.
\]

Finally, we verify the solution by substituting \(a = -2\) and \(b = 1\) into the third equation:
\[

\]
\[
-a^3 - 3a^2 = -(-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 = 8 - 12 = -4.

"To solve the equation \(2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the left side of the equation.
2. Express the right side of the equation as a product of its prime factors.
3. Compare the prime factorizations to find the value of \(x\).

Let's start with the left side of the equation:
\[2^3 = 8.\]
So the equation becomes:
\[8 \cdot 3^x = 72.\]

Next, we express the right side of the equation as a product of its prime factors:
\[72 = 8 \cdot 9 = 8 \cdot 3^2.\]
So the equation now is:
\[8 \cdot 3^x = 8 \cdot 3^2.\]

Since the bases are the same and the factors are equal, we can equate the exponents of 3:
\[3^x = 3^2.\]
Therefore, \(x = 2\).

"To solve the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\) for \(x\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\), we start by rewriting the equation using the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we use the property that \(2\log(x+2) = \log((x+2)^2)\). This gives us:

\[
\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2)
\]

Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:

\[
kx = (x+2)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[
kx = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]

Rearranging terms to form a standard quadratic equation, we have:

\[
x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
\]

For this quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = 4-k\), and \(c = 4\), so the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16
\]

Setting the discriminant equal to zero, we get:

\[
(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0
\]

This can be factored as:

\[
(4-k-4)(4-k+4) = 0
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
k(k-8) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are:

\[
k = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad k = 8
\]

However, \(k = 0\) is not a valid solution because it would make the original equation \(\log(0 \cdot x) = 2\log(x+2)\), which is undefined. Therefore, the only valid solution is \(k = 8\).

Next, we need to check if \(k = 8\) gives a solution \(x\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\). Substituting \(k = 8\) back into the quadratic equation, we get:

\[
x^2 + (4-8)x + 4 = 0 \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \implies (x-2)^2 = 0
\]

So, the solution is:

\[
x = 2

Since \(x = 2\) is in the interval \([-500, 500]\), \(k = 8\) is indeed a valid solution.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. To do this, we will eliminate \( G \) from the equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
12T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3T = S

"To find the maximum possible slope of the line passing through points \( A \) and \( B \), we need to consider the positions of these points within their respective squares.

First, let's define the squares:
- The square containing point \( A \) has vertices at \((0,0)\) and \((2,2)\). Therefore, the square is defined by the inequalities \(0 \leq x \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 2\).
- The square containing point \( B \) has vertices at \((4,2)\) and \((5,3)\). Therefore, the square is defined by the inequalities \(4 \leq x \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq y \leq 3\).

The slope \( m \) of the line passing through points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

To maximize the slope, we should choose the point \( A \) with the smallest \( x \)-coordinate and the largest \( y \)-coordinate, and the point \( B \) with the largest \( x \)-coordinate and the largest \( y \)-coordinate. This is because the numerator \( y_2 - y_1 \) will be maximized and the denominator \( x_2 - x_1 \) will be minimized.

Thus, we choose \( A = (0, 2) \) and \( B = (5, 3) \). Substituting these coordinates into the slope formula, we get:
\[ m = \frac{3 - 2}{5 - 0} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible slope of the line passing through points \( A \) and \( B \) is:

"To solve the equation \(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's rewrite the equation for clarity:
\[3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x.\]

We can use the property of exponents that \(3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x\). So, the equation becomes:
\[9^x + 19 = 10^x.\]

Next, we will isolate the exponential terms on one side of the equation. Subtract \(9^x\) from both sides:
\[19 = 10^x - 9^x.\]

To find a solution, we can try some simple values for \(x\). Let's start with \(x = 2\):
\[10^2 = 100,\]
\[9^2 = 81,\]
\[10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19.\]

So, \(x = 2\) satisfies the equation. To confirm that there are no other solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the functions \(10^x\) and \(9^x\). The function \(10^x\) grows faster than \(9^x\), so the difference \(10^x - 9^x\) is an increasing function. Therefore, the equation \(10^x - 9^x = 19\) can have at most one solution, which we have found to be \(x = 2\).

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

**Case 1: \( 5x-1 \geq 0 \)**
In this case, \( |5x-1| = 5x-1 \). The equation becomes:
\[ 5x-1 = x+3 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 4x-1 = 3 \]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[ 4x = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 1 \]
We need to check if this solution satisfies the condition \( 5x-1 \geq 0 \). Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the condition:
\[ 5(1) - 1 = 4 \geq 0 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( 5x-1 < 0 \)**
In this case, \( |5x-1| = -(5x-1) = -5x+1 \). The equation becomes:
\[ -5x+1 = x+3 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ -6x+1 = 3 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ -6x = 2 \]
Divide both sides by -6:

So, \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is a valid solution.

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its piecewise definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = a\), and the value of the function at the vertex is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \geq a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \leq a^3\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line has a positive slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y < a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the line has a negative slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y > a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) must together cover all real numbers. This means that the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function intersects every horizontal line at least once.
- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).

Solving the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0 \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing the intervals determined by these roots, we find:
- For \(a < -1\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(-1 < a < 0\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).
- For \(0 < a < 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(a > 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) is satisfied for \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 \leq a \leq 2\).

The maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers \(3339\), \(2961\), and \(1491\), we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Let's start by finding the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\).

1. Divide \(3339\) by \(2961\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   3339 \div 2961 \approx 1.125 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}

   \[
   3339 - 1 \cdot 2961 = 3339 - 2961 = 378

   So, the remainder is \(378\).

2. Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(2961\) and \(378\):
   \[
   2961 \div 378 \approx 7.8333 \quad \text{(integer part is 7)}
   \]
   \[
   2961 - 7 \cdot 378 = 2961 - 2646 = 315
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(315\).

3. Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(378\) and \(315\):
   \[
   378 \div 315 \approx 1.2 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   378 - 1 \cdot 315 = 378 - 315 = 63
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(63\).

4. Finally, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(315\) and \(63\):
   \[
   315 \div 63 = 5 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
   \]
   \[
   315 - 5 \cdot 63 = 315 - 315 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\) is \(63\).

Next, we need to find the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\).

1. Divide \(1491\) by \(63\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   1491 \div 63 \approx 23.6667 \quad \text{(integer part is 23)}
   \]
   \[
   1491 - 23 \cdot 63 = 1491 - 1449 = 42
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(42\).

2. Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(63\) and \(42\):
   \[
   63 \div 42 \approx 1.5 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   63 - 1 \cdot 42 = 63 - 42 = 21
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(21\).

3. Finally, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(42\) and \(21\):
   \[
   42 \div 21 = 2 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
   \]
   \[
   42 - 2 \cdot 21 = 42 - 42 = 0
   \]

"To determine the smallest integer \( x \) for which the function \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \) has real values, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression inside the function is defined and real.

1. **Identify the domain of the square root:**
   The expression inside the square root, \( x-1 \), must be non-negative because the square root of a negative number is not real. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x - 1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 1
   \]

2. **Identify the domain of the denominator:**
   The denominator \( x-2 \) must not be zero because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we have:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

First, we compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
\]

Next, we compute \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2 \cdot 1 + y \cdot (-2) + (-5) \cdot 1 = 2 - 2y - 5 = -3 - 2y
\]

Using the projection formula, we get:

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We are given that this projection is equal to \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) are the same, we can equate the scalar coefficients:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

To clear the denominators, we multiply both sides by 6:

\[
-3 - 2y = 5
\]

Next, we solve for \( y \):

\[
-2y = 5 + 3

\[
-2y = 8

First, we use the dot product condition:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y + 1 \cdot z = x + y + z = 2.
\]

Next, we use the cross product condition:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot y \\ 1 \cdot x - 1 \cdot z \\ 1 \cdot y - 1 \cdot x \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We set this equal to the given vector:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
z - y = 1, \quad x - z = -2, \quad y - x = 1.
\]

We can solve this system step by step. From the third equation, we have:
\[
y = x + 1.
\]
Substitute \(y = x + 1\) into the first equation:
\[
z - (x + 1) = 1 \implies z - x - 1 = 1 \implies z = x + 2.
\]
Now substitute \(z = x + 2\) into the second equation:
\[
x - (x + 2) = -2 \implies x - x - 2 = -2 \implies -2 = -2.
\]
This equation is true, so it does not provide new information. We have \(y = x + 1\) and \(z = x + 2\). Substitute these into the dot product equation:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 2 \implies 3x + 3 = 2 \implies 3x = -1 \implies x = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]
Then,
\[
y = x + 1 = -\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3},
\]
and
\[
z = x + 2 = -\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3}.

Therefore, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\):
\[ f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This gives:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Let's simplify the left-hand side:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1. \]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy this equation, we need to consider the conditions under which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

We already know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are fixed points. Therefore, \(x\) must be a solution of the cubic equation that is not equal to these fixed points. By analyzing the behavior of the function and the cubic equation, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are:
\[ \lambda = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = 4. \]

For \(\lambda = 2\), the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The cubic equation becomes:
\[ 4 - 6x + 8x^2 - 8x^3 = 1, \]
\[ 8x^3 - 8x^2 + 6x - 3 = 0. \]
This equation has a solution \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and two other solutions in \([0,1]\) that are not fixed points.

For \(\lambda = 4\), the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\). The cubic equation becomes:

"To find the points of intersection of the two circles given by the equations \(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0\) and \(x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0\), we start by subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[
(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72) - (x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46) = 0
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
2y^2 - 40y + 118 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2, we have:

\[
y^2 - 20y + 59 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 59\):

\[
y = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 236}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{164}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm 2\sqrt{41}}{2} = 10 \pm \sqrt{41}
\]

So, the solutions for \(y\) are \(y = 10 + \sqrt{41}\) and \(y = 10 - \sqrt{41}\).

Next, we substitute these values of \(y\) back into one of the original circle equations to find the corresponding \(x\) values. We use the first equation \(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0\).

For \(y = 10 + \sqrt{41}\):

\[
x^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41})^2 + 6x - 24(10 + \sqrt{41}) + 72 = 0
\]

Simplifying inside the equation:

\[
x^2 + 100 + 20\sqrt{41} + 41 + 6x - 240 - 24\sqrt{41} + 72 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 6x - 27 + (-4\sqrt{41}) = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \(x\). We solve it using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = -27 - 4\sqrt{41}\):

\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4(1)(-27 - 4\sqrt{41})}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 108 + 16\sqrt{41}}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{144 + 16\sqrt{41}}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}
\]

So, the solutions for \(x\) are \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\).

For \(y = 10 - \sqrt{41}\):

\[
x^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41})^2 + 6x - 24(10 - \sqrt{41}) + 72 = 0
\]

Simplifying inside the equation:

\[
x^2 + 100 - 20\sqrt{41} + 41 + 6x - 240 + 24\sqrt{41} + 72 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 6x - 27 + (4\sqrt{41}) = 0
\]

This is another quadratic equation in \(x\). We solve it using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = -27 + 4\sqrt{41}\):

\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4(1)(-27 + 4\sqrt{41})}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 108 - 16\sqrt{41}}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{144 - 16\sqrt{41}}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}
\]

So, the solutions for \(x\) are \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}\).

The points of intersection are:
\[
\left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right)

For the point \(\left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right)\):

\[
d = \sqrt{\left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}} + 3\right)^2 + \left(10 + \sqrt{41} - 2\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\right)^2 + \left(8 + \sqrt{41}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4(9 + \sqrt{41}) + (8 + \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41} + 64 + 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 + 20\sqrt{41}}
\]

For the point \(\left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right)\):

\[
d = \sqrt{\left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}} + 3\right)^2 + \left(10 + \sqrt{41} - 2\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(-2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\right)^2 + \left(8 + \sqrt{41}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4(9 + \sqrt{41}) + (8 + \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41} + 64 + 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 + 20\sqrt{41}}

For the point \(\left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right)\):

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the foci of the ellipse given by the equation \(kx^2 + y^2 = 1\). The standard form of an ellipse is \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), where \(a^2 = \frac{1}{k}\) and \(b^2 = 1\). Since \(k > 1\), we have \(a^2 < b^2\), so the major axis is along the \(y\)-axis. The distance of each focus from the center is given by \(c = \sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} = \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}}\). Therefore, the foci are located at \((0, \pm \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}})\).

Next, we consider the circle that passes through the foci \(F_1 = (0, -\sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}})\) and \(F_2 = (0, \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}})\). The center of this circle must lie on the \(y\)-axis, and its radius is the distance from the center to either focus. Let the center of the circle be \((0, h)\). The radius of the circle is then \(|h| + \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}}\).

The circle also touches the \(x\)-axis at two points, which means the radius of the circle is equal to the \(y\)-coordinate of the center, i.e., \(|h|\). Therefore, we have:
\[
|h| = |h| + \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}}
\]
This equation is not possible unless \(h = 0\). So, the center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}}\).

The equation of the circle is then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{k-1}{k}
\]

We need to find the points where this circle intersects the ellipse. Substituting \(y^2 = \frac{k-1}{k} - x^2\) into the ellipse equation \(kx^2 + y^2 = 1\), we get:
\[
kx^2 + \left(\frac{k-1}{k} - x^2\right) = 1
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
kx^2 + \frac{k-1}{k} - x^2 = 1 \implies (k-1)x^2 + \frac{k-1}{k} = 1 \implies (k-1)x^2 = 1 - \frac{k-1}{k} \implies (k-1)x^2 = \frac{1}{k} \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{k(k-1)}
\]
Thus, the \(x\)-coordinates of the intersection points are:
\[
x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(k-1)}}
\]

The corresponding \(y\)-coordinates are:
\[
y^2 = \frac{k-1}{k} - \frac{1}{k(k-1)} = \frac{(k-1)^2 - 1}{k(k-1)} = \frac{k^2 - 2k + 1 - 1}{k(k-1)} = \frac{k(k-2)}{k(k-1)} = \frac{k-2}{k-1}
\]
So, the \(y\)-coordinates are:
\[
y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{k-2}{k-1}}
\]

For the circle to be tangent to the ellipse at these points, the slope of the tangent to the ellipse at these points must be equal to the slope of the tangent to the circle at these points. The slope of the tangent to the circle at \((\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(k-1)}}, \pm \sqrt{\frac{k-2}{k-1}})\) is \(-\frac{x}{y} = \mp \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k-2}}\).

The slope of the tangent to the ellipse at \((x, y)\) is given by implicitly differentiating the ellipse equation:
\[
2kx + 2yy' = 0 \implies y' = -\frac{kx}{y}
\]
At the point \((\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(k-1)}}, \pm \sqrt{\frac{k-2}{k-1}})\), the slope is:
\[
y' = -\frac{k \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(k-1)}}}{\sqrt{\frac{k-2}{k-1}}} = -\sqrt{\frac{k}{k-2}}
\]

Equating the slopes, we get:
\[
-\sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k-2}} = -\sqrt{\frac{k}{k-2}} \implies \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{k}{k-2} \implies k-1 = k
\]
This is a contradiction unless the denominators are zero, which is not possible. Therefore, we must have:
\[
k-2 = 0 \implies k = 2

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) such that

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using known values, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we need to calculate the combinations separately for the boys and the girls, and then multiply these results together.

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7. The number of combinations of \( n \) items taken \( r \) at a time is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

For the boys, \( n = 7 \) and \( r = 3 \):

\[
\binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{210}{6} = 35

Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to get the total number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls:

"To find the integers \( C \) and \( D \) such that the equation

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) (except \( -8 \) and \( 3 \)), we start by factoring the denominator on the right-hand side. Notice that

\[
x^2 + 5x - 24 = (x-3)(x+8).
\]

Thus, the equation becomes

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.
\]

To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we need a common denominator, which is \( (x-3)(x+8) \). Therefore, we can rewrite the left-hand side as

\[
\frac{C(x+8) + D(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:

\[
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23.
\]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get

\[

\]

Combining like terms, we have

\[
(C+D)x + (8C-3D) = 4x - 23.
\]

For the equation to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:

\[
C + D = 4,
\]
\[
8C - 3D = -23.
\]

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the first equation for \( D \):

\[
D = 4 - C.
\]

Next, substitute \( D = 4 - C \) into the second equation:

\[
8C - 3(4 - C) = -23.
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
8C - 12 + 3C = -23,
\]
\[
11C - 12 = -23.
\]

Add 12 to both sides:

\[
11C = -11.

Divide both sides by 11:

\[
C = -1.
\]

Now substitute \( C = -1 \) back into the equation \( D = 4 - C \):

\[
D = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5.

Thus, we have \( C = -1 \) and \( D = 5 \). The product \( CD \) is

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each, so \( n_3 = n_4 = n_5 = 1 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

"To solve the equation \(2^{2x} = 256^{\frac{1}{2}}\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Let's start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation.

First, we know that \(256\) can be written as a power of 2. Specifically, \(256 = 2^8\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right-hand side as follows:
\[
256^{\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we get:
\[
(2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^4.
\]
So, the equation \(2^{2x} = 256^{\frac{1}{2}}\) simplifies to:
\[
2^{2x} = 2^4.
\]
Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[
2x = 4.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt{3x-5}=2\), we need to eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt{3x-5}=2
   \]

2. Square both sides to remove the square root:
   \[
   (\sqrt{3x-5})^2=2^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x-5=4
   \]

3. Next, isolate the term with \(x\) by adding 5 to both sides:
   \[
   3x-5+5=4+5
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3x=9

4. Finally, solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   x=\frac{9}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x=3

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(x=3\) back into the original equation and check if it holds true:
\[

"To find the number of integer ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the inequality \(|a + bi| \le 5\), we start by recalling the definition of the magnitude of a complex number. The magnitude of a complex number \(a + bi\) is given by:

\[
|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

The inequality \(|a + bi| \le 5\) can therefore be rewritten as:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \le 5
\]

Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get:

\[
a^2 + b^2 \le 25
\]

This inequality describes a disk in the \(a\)-\(b\) plane with center at the origin \((0, 0)\) and radius 5. We need to count all the integer points \((a, b)\) that lie within or on the boundary of this disk.

First, we determine the possible values for \(a\). Since \(a^2 \le 25\), it follows that:

\[
-5 \le a \le 5
\]

For each value of \(a\) in this range, we need to find the corresponding integer values of \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 \le 25\). We will consider each value of \(a\) from \(-5\) to \(5\) and count the valid \(b\) values.

1. If \(a = 5\) or \(a = -5\), then \(b^2 \le 0\), so \(b = 0\). There is 1 possible value for \(b\).
2. If \(a = 4\) or \(a = -4\), then \(b^2 \le 9\), so \(b\) can be \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). There are 7 possible values for \(b\).
3. If \(a = 3\) or \(a = -3\), then \(b^2 \le 16\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 possible values for \(b\).
4. If \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\), then \(b^2 \le 21\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 possible values for \(b\).
5. If \(a = 1\) or \(a = -1\), then \(b^2 \le 24\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 possible values for \(b\).
6. If \(a = 0\), then \(b^2 \le 25\), so \(b\) can be \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\). There are 11 possible values for \(b\).

"To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5\), we need to combine the fractions on the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x}{3}\).

The denominators are 2 and 3. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6.

First, we convert \(\frac{x}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{x \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{3x}{6}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{x}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = \frac{x \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{2x}{6}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions together:
\[
\frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{3x + 2x}{6} = \frac{5x}{6}
\]

So, the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5\) becomes:
\[

To solve for \(x\), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:
\[

This simplifies to:
\[
5x = 30

"To find the area of quadrilateral \(DBEF\), we start by determining the coordinates of points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).

Given:
- \(A = (0, 6)\)
- \(B = (0, 0)\)
- \(C = (8, 0)\)

Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), its coordinates are:
\[ D = \left( \frac{0+0}{2}, \frac{6+0}{2} \right) = (0, 3) \]

Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\), its coordinates are:
\[ E = \left( \frac{0+8}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2} \right) = (4, 0) \]

To find the coordinates of \(F\), we need to determine the intersection of line segments \(\overline{AE}\) and \(\overline{CD}\).

First, find the equation of line \(\overline{AE}\):
- \(A = (0, 6)\)
- \(E = (4, 0)\)

The slope of \(\overline{AE}\) is:
\[ m_{AE} = \frac{0-6}{4-0} = -\frac{3}{2} \]

Using point-slope form \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(A\):
\[ y - 6 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 0) \]
\[ y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 \]

Next, find the equation of line \(\overline{CD}\):
- \(C = (8, 0)\)
- \(D = (0, 3)\)

The slope of \(\overline{CD}\) is:
\[ m_{CD} = \frac{3-0}{0-8} = -\frac{3}{8} \]

Using point-slope form with point \(C\):
\[ y - 0 = -\frac{3}{8}(x - 8) \]
\[ y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]

To find the intersection \(F\) of these two lines, set the equations equal to each other:
\[ -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]

Multiply through by 8 to clear the denominators:
\[ -12x + 48 = -3x + 24 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ -12x + 3x = 24 - 48 \]
\[ -9x = -24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3} \]

Substitute \(x = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation of \(\overline{AE}\) to find \(y\):
\[ y = -\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) + 6 \]
\[ y = -4 + 6 \]
\[ y = 2 \]

Thus, the coordinates of \(F\) are:
\[ F = \left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right) \]

Now, we have the coordinates of the vertices of quadrilateral \(DBEF\):
- \(D = (0, 3)\)
- \(B = (0, 0)\)
- \(E = (4, 0)\)
- \(F = \left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right)\)

To find the area of quadrilateral \(DBEF\), we use the Shoelace Theorem. The Shoelace Theorem states that for vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\), the area is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \right| \]

List the coordinates in order and repeat the first vertex:
\[ (0, 3), (0, 0), (4, 0), \left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right), (0, 3) \]

Apply the Shoelace Theorem:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 + 4 \cdot 2 + \frac{8}{3} \cdot 3 - (3 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot \frac{8}{3} + 2 \cdot 0) \right| \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) \right| \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| 16 \right| \]

"To solve the equation \( |x+5| - |3x-6| = 0 \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that satisfy this equation. This can be done by considering the different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. The critical points are \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 2 \). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

**Case 1: \( x < -5 \)**

In this interval, both \( x+5 < 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
-(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
-x-5 + 3x-6 = 0 \implies 2x - 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
However, \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) does not satisfy \( x < -5 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

**Case 2: \( -5 \leq x < 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \geq 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
x+5 + 3x-6 = 0 \implies 4x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) satisfies \( -5 \leq x < 2 \), it is a solution.

**Case 3: \( x \geq 2 \)**

In this interval, both \( x+5 \geq 0 \) and \( 3x-6 \geq 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
(x+5) - (3x-6) = 0
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
x+5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \implies -2x + 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Since \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) satisfies \( x \geq 2 \), it is a solution.

The solutions to the equation are \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = \frac{11}{2} \). The maximum possible value of \( x \) is \( \frac{11}{2} \).

"To solve for \( z_{2002} \) given the function \( F(z) = \frac{z+i}{z-i} \) and the initial condition \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), we first need to understand the behavior of the function \( F \) and its iterates.

First, let's compute \( F(z_0) \):
\[
z_1 = F(z_0) = F\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) + i}{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) - i} = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 274i.

Next, let's compute \( F(z_1) \):
\[

\]
To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z_2 = \frac{(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 275 \cdot 273i^2}{1 - (273i)^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 275 \cdot 273}{1 + 273^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 74925}{1 + 74529} = \frac{74926 + 2i}{74530} = \frac{37463}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i.
\]

Now, let's compute \( F(z_2) \):
\[
z_3 = F(z_2) = F\left( \frac{37463}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i \right) = \frac{\left( \frac{37463}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i \right) + i}{\left( \frac{37463}{37265} + \frac{1}{37265}i \right) - i} = \frac{\frac{37463}{37265} + \frac{37266}{37265}i}{\frac{37463}{37265} - \frac{37264}{37265}i}.

Again, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:

\]
Notice that the numerator and the denominator are real numbers, and the imaginary part of the numerator is zero. Therefore, \( z_3 \) is a real number.

Now, let's compute \( F(z_3) \):
\[
z_4 = F(z_3) = F(z_3) = \frac{z_3 + i}{z_3 - i}.
\]
Since \( z_3 \) is real, \( z_4 \) is purely imaginary. Next, let's compute \( F(z_4) \):
\[
z_5 = F(z_4) = F(z_4) = \frac{z_4 + i}{z_4 - i}.
\]
Since \( z_4 \) is purely imaginary, \( z_5 \) is real again. We observe that the sequence \( z_n \) is periodic with a period of 2. Therefore, \( z_{2002} = z_2 \).

From our earlier calculation, we have:

First, we perform the division of 11213141 by 18:
\[ 11213141 \div 18 = 622952.2777\ldots \]
The integer part of the quotient is 622952. Now, we multiply 18 by 622952 to find the product:
\[ 18 \times 622952 = 11213136 \]
Next, we subtract this product from 11213141 to find the remainder:

\[
f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(-3) = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 2

We know that \( f(-3) = 2 \), so we can set up the equation:

\[

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

Factor out the common term 9:

Next, we list the factors of 42:
\[42 = 1 \times 42 = 2 \times 21 = 3 \times 14 = 6 \times 7\]
So, the factors of 42 are: \(1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\).

Now, we identify the common factors of 14 and 42 by comparing the two lists:

"To find the equation of the hyperbola given by the condition \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \) where \( F_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( F_2 = (-16, 2) \), we start by recalling the definition of a hyperbola. The set of all points \( P \) such that the absolute difference of the distances from \( P \) to the two foci is constant is a hyperbola.

The standard form of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis is:
\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where \( (h, k) \) is the center of the hyperbola, \( 2a \) is the distance between the vertices, and the distance between the foci is \( 2c \). The relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

First, we find the center \( (h, k) \) of the hyperbola. The center is the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \):
\[
h = \frac{10 + (-16)}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad k = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
So, the center is \( (-3, 2) \).

Next, we determine the value of \( c \), which is half the distance between the foci:
\[
c = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

The distance between the foci is \( 2c = 24 \), and the distance between the foci is also given by \( 2c = 2\sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = 2\sqrt{26^2} = 52 \). However, we need to correct this step. The correct distance between the foci is \( 2c = 2\sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = 2\sqrt{26^2} = 52 \). Therefore, \( c = 13 \).

The value of \( a \) is half the constant difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci:
\[
2a = 24 \implies a = 12
\]

Now, we use the relationship \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \) to find \( b \):
\[
13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5
\]

Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\frac{(x + 3)^2}{144} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{25} = 1
\]

Finally, we find \( h + k + a + b \):
\[
h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 multiples of 5.

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   So, there are no multiples of 125.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no multiples of 125 in the range, we stop here.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

"To find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\), we start by letting \(d = \gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\). This means that \(d\) divides both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\). Consequently, \(d\) must also divide any linear combination of \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\). Specifically, we can consider the expression \(2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 2n + 14 - 2n - 1 = 13\). Therefore, \(d\) must divide 13.

Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values for \(d\) are 1 and 13. To determine if \(d\) can actually be 13, we need to find an integer \(n\) such that both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\) are divisible by 13. Let's assume \(n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}\). Then \(n \equiv -7 \pmod{13}\), or equivalently, \(n \equiv 6 \pmod{13}\). If we substitute \(n = 13k + 6\) for some integer \(k\) into \(2n + 1\), we get:
\[2n + 1 = 2(13k + 6) + 1 = 26k + 12 + 1 = 26k + 13 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}.\]
Thus, \(2n + 1\) is also divisible by 13 when \(n \equiv 6 \pmod{13}\). Therefore, the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\) is indeed 13.

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

We can expand this determinant as follows:

\[

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given that \(xyz = 2\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

First, we rewrite the expression as:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to each term in a strategic way. Consider the terms \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), and \(2y^2\). By AM-GM, we have:
\[x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2} = 3 \sqrt[3]{4x^4 y^4}.\]

Similarly, we can apply AM-GM to the terms \(4z^4\), \(2y^2\), and \(2y^2\):
\[4z^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{4z^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2} = 3 \sqrt[3]{16z^4 y^4}.\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the AM-GM inequality directly on the original expression by considering the terms in a different way. Let's rewrite the expression as:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4.\]

Applying AM-GM to the terms \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), \(2y^2\), and \(4z^4\), we get:
\[x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 4z^4} = 4 \sqrt[4]{16x^4 y^4 z^4}.\]

Since \(xyz = 2\), we have \(x^4 y^4 z^4 = (xyz)^4 = 2^4 = 16\). Therefore:
\[4 \sqrt[4]{16x^4 y^4 z^4} = 4 \sqrt[4]{16 \cdot 16} = 4 \sqrt[4]{256} = 4 \cdot 4 = 16.\]

To check if this minimum value is achievable, we need to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) such that the equality condition of AM-GM holds. The equality condition for AM-GM is that all the terms are equal. Therefore, we need:
\[x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^4.\]

From \(x^4 = 2y^2\), we get \(y^2 = \frac{x^4}{2}\) or \(y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\).

From \(x^4 = 4z^4\), we get \(z^4 = \frac{x^4}{4}\) or \(z = \frac{x}{\sqrt[4]{4}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\).

Substituting \(y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(z = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\) into the constraint \(xyz = 2\), we get:
\[x \cdot \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} = 2.\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[\frac{x^4}{2} = 2 \implies x^4 = 4 \implies x = \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt{2}.\]

Then, \(y = \frac{(\sqrt{2})^2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\) and \(z = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1\).

Substituting \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = \sqrt{2}\), and \(z = 1\) into the original expression, we get:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 + 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 4(1)^4 = 4 + 8 + 4 = 16.\]

These distances correspond to the sides of a triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5. Since \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\), the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle between the sides of lengths 3 and 4.

   The inequality \(x + y \leq 4\) represents a region below the line \(y = 4 - x\). This line intersects the x-axis at \(x = 4\) (when \(y = 0\)) and intersects the y-axis at \(y = 4\) (when \(x = 0\)). 

   The region below this line forms a right triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((4, 0)\), and \((0, 4)\). The area \(A_{\text{triangle}}\) of this triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 4 = 8.
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability**:
   The probability \(P\) that a randomly chosen point \((x, y)\) satisfies \(x + y \leq 4\) is given by the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle:
   \[
   P = \frac{A_{\text{triangle}}}{A_{\text{total}}} = \frac{8}{32} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

"To find the value of \(a + b + c\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24\), we first need to rewrite the equation in standard polynomial form. We start by eliminating the fraction by multiplying every term by \(x\):

\[
x \left( \frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 \right) = x (6x - 24)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x
\]

Next, we move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero:

According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is given by \(-\frac{b}{a}\).

"To find the maximum possible value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\), we start by simplifying the expression using the difference of squares formula. The expression can be rewritten as:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2 = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2
\]

Next, we need to determine the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) given the constraints \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\).

First, consider the term \(\frac{1}{b^2}\). Since \(b\) is in the range \([3, 5]\), \(b^2\) is in the range \([9, 25]\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is in the range \(\left[\frac{1}{25}, \frac{1}{9}\right]\).

Next, consider the term \(-a^2\). Since \(a\) is in the range \([-6, -2]\), \(a^2\) is in the range \([4, 36]\). Therefore, \(-a^2\) is in the range \([-36, -4]\).

To maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\), we need to take the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) and the minimum value of \(-a^2\). The maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is \(\frac{1}{9}\) and the minimum value of \(-a^2\) is \(-4\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) is:

\]

Using the identity \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ\) and \(\cos 100^\circ = \cos (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = -\cos 80^\circ\), we have:

\]

We know that \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos 80^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin 10^\circ}.
\]

Thus,

\[

We know that \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{\sin 10^\circ}\) and \(\cos 10^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), so:

First, substitute \(y = x^2 - 8\) into \(y^2 = -5x + 44\):
\[
(x^2 - 8)^2 = -5x + 44.
\]
Next, expand the left side of the equation:

\]
Rearrange the equation to set it to zero:
\[
x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0.
\]
We need to find the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(x_1, x_2, x_3,\) and \(x_4\). For each root \(x_i\), the corresponding \(y_i\) is given by \(y_i = x_i^2 - 8\).

The product of the \(y\)-coordinates of the solutions is:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8).
\]
To find this product, we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \(x_i^2\) is obtained by substituting \(x = \sqrt{t}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{t}\) into the original polynomial and then eliminating \(x\). However, a simpler approach is to use Vieta's formulas and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, note that the polynomial \(x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0\) can be factored as:
\[
(x^2 + x - 4)(x^2 - x - 5) = 0.

The roots of \(x^2 + x - 4 = 0\) are:

x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{17}}{2},
\]
and the roots of \(x^2 - x - 5 = 0\) are:
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}.
\]
Now, we find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinates:

y_1 = \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{17}}{2}\right)^2 - 8 = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{17} + 17}{4} - 8 = \frac{18 - 2\sqrt{17}}{4} - 8 = \frac{9 - \sqrt{17}}{2} - 8 = \frac{9 - \sqrt{17} - 16}{2} = \frac{-7 - \sqrt{17}}{2},

\[

\]
\[
y_4 = \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{21}}{2}\right)^2 - 8 = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{21} + 21}{4} - 8 = \frac{22 - 2\sqrt{21}}{4} - 8 = \frac{11 - \sqrt{21}}{2} - 8 = \frac{11 - \sqrt{21} - 16}{2} = \frac{-5 - \sqrt{21}}{2}.

The denominators are 5 and 3. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 15.

First, we convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

"To determine the number of \( y \)-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \), we need to find the points where the parabola intersects the \( y \)-axis. At the \( y \)-axis, the value of \( x \) is 0. Therefore, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation and solve for \( y \).

Starting with the equation:
\[ x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \]

\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \]
This simplifies to the quadratic equation:

Here, the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

"To find the minimum possible value of \( |m - n| \) given the equation \( 3m + 4n = 100 \), we start by expressing \( m \) in terms of \( n \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4n}{3} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 100 - 4n \) must be divisible by 3. We can check the divisibility by examining the remainder when 100 and \( 4n \) are divided by 3:

\[ 100 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 4n \equiv n \pmod{3} \]

Thus, we need:

\[ 1 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]

This means \( n \) can be written as:

\[ n = 3k + 1 \]

for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k + 1 \) into the expression for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4(3k + 1)}{3} = \frac{100 - 12k - 4}{3} = \frac{96 - 12k}{3} = 32 - 4k \]

Now, we need to minimize \( |m - n| \):

\[ |m - n| = |(32 - 4k) - (3k + 1)| = |31 - 7k| \]

To minimize \( |31 - 7k| \), we find the integer \( k \) closest to \( \frac{31}{7} \):

\[ \frac{31}{7} \approx 4.4286 \]

The closest integers are \( k = 4 \) and \( k = 5 \). We evaluate \( |31 - 7k| \) for these values:

For \( k = 4 \):

\[ |31 - 7 \cdot 4| = |31 - 28| = 3 \]

For \( k = 5 \):

\[ |31 - 7 \cdot 5| = |31 - 35| = 4 \]

"To find the equation of the plane that contains the points \((0, -1, -1)\), \((-4, 4, 4)\), and \((4, 5, 1)\), we start by determining two vectors that lie in the plane. We can do this by finding the vectors between the points.

Let \(\mathbf{v_1} = (-4, 4, 4) - (0, -1, -1) = (-4, 5, 5)\) and \(\mathbf{v_2} = (4, 5, 1) - (0, -1, -1) = (4, 6, 2)\).

Next, we find the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) to the plane by taking the cross product of \(\mathbf{v_1}\) and \(\mathbf{v_2}\):
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v_1} \times \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -4 & 5 & 5 \\ 4 & 6 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(5 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 6) - \mathbf{j}(-4 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 4) + \mathbf{k}(-4 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 4) = \mathbf{i}(10 - 30) - \mathbf{j}(-8 - 20) + \mathbf{k}(-24 - 20) = -20\mathbf{i} + 28\mathbf{j} - 44\mathbf{k}.
\]
Thus, the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n} = (-20, 28, -44)\).

The equation of the plane can be written as:
\[
-20(x - 0) + 28(y + 1) - 44(z + 1) = 0.

Simplifying, we get:

"To express the given expression \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\), we first need to rationalize the denominators of the fractions.

Starting with \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Similarly, for \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Now, substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Next, combine the terms involving \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

And combine the terms involving \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6}
\]
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3} \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6} + \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

Thus, the expression \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\) is \(\frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}\), where \(a = 9\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 6\).

Finally, calculate \(a + b + c\):

"To find the set of all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}\), we will analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's denote the expression by \(E\):
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}. \]

### Step 1: Establish a Lower Bound
We start by finding a lower bound for \(E\). Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\),
\[ \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \geq 2. \]
However, we can use a different approach here. Consider the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\). Since \(b\) and \(c\) are positive, \(b+c > c\), so \(\frac{a}{b+c} < \frac{a}{c}\). Therefore,
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} > \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}. \]
Now, we need to find a lower bound for \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}\). Using the AM-GM inequality again,
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}. \]
Since \(\sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}\) can be arbitrarily close to 0 (by choosing \(b\) very small compared to \(a\)), the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}\) can be arbitrarily close to 0. Therefore, \(E\) can be arbitrarily close to 0, but it is always positive. So, the lower bound is 0.

### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound
Next, we find an upper bound for \(E\). Consider the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\). Since \(b\) and \(c\) are positive, \(b+c > b\), so \(\frac{a}{b+c} < \frac{a}{b}\). Therefore,
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} < \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c}. \]
Now, we need to find an upper bound for \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c}\). Using the AM-GM inequality again,
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 3. \]
However, we can achieve the value 3 by setting \(a = b = c\). In this case,
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a+a} + \frac{a}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{5}{2}. \]
Therefore, the upper bound is \(\frac{5}{2}\).

### Conclusion
Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the set of all possible values of \(E\) is \((0, \infty)\).

Thus, the final answer is:

So the equation becomes:

First, we find the divisors of \( 24 \). The divisors of \( 24 \) are the positive integers that divide \( 24 \) without leaving a remainder. We can list them by checking each integer from \( 1 \) to \( 24 \):

\[

\]

We can cancel out the common terms on both sides:

\[
3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13
\]

Rearranging the equation gives:

\[
0 = 4x^3 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x^2 - 6x - 2x + 13 - 1
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
0 = x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12
\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the polynomial \( x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 \). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots, which are the factors of the constant term (12) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

Testing these values:

  \[
  1^3 - 5(1^2) - 8(1) + 12 = 1 - 5 - 8 + 12 = 0 \quad \text{(root)}
  \]

Since \( x = 1 \) is a root, we can factor \( (x - 1) \) out of the polynomial. We can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor.

Using synthetic division with \( x = 1 \):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
1 & 1 & -5 & -8 & 12 \\
  &   & 1  & -4 & -12 \\
\hline
  & 1 & -4 & -12 & 0 \\

\]

This gives us the quotient \( x^2 - 4x - 12 \). We can factor this quadratic:

\[
x^2 - 4x - 12 = (x - 6)(x + 2)
\]

Thus, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:

\[
x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x - 6)(x + 2)

The roots of the polynomial are \( x = 1, x = 6, \) and \( x = -2 \). The maximum \( x \) value among these roots is \( x = 6 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum reduction in the total length of the ropes by replacing the ropes \(HC\) and \(HD\) with a single rope \(HP\), where \(P\) is a point on the line segment \(CD\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the points:
- \(O = (0, 0)\)
- \(A = (a, 0)\)
- \(B = (-a, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -c)\)
- \(D = (0, d)\)

Given that the distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is 140 meters, we have:
\[d + c = 140\]

The coordinates of the hot air balloon \(H\) are \((0, h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the balloon above the plane.

The lengths of the ropes are given by the distances from \(H\) to each of the points:
- \(HC = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (h + c)^2} = h + c\)
- \(HD = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (h - d)^2} = h - d\)

We are given:
\[HC = 150\]
\[HD = 130\]

From these equations, we can solve for \(h\):
\[h + c = 150\]
\[h - d = 130\]

Adding these two equations:
\[(h + c) + (h - d) = 150 + 130\]
\[2h + c - d = 280\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[(h + c) - (h - d) = 150 - 130\]
\[c + d = 20\]

We now have two equations:
\[2h + c - d = 280\]
\[c + d = 20\]

Substitute \(d = 20 - c\) into the first equation:
\[2h + c - (20 - c) = 280\]
\[2h + 2c - 20 = 280\]
\[2h + 2c = 300\]
\[h + c = 150\]

This is consistent with the given \(HC = 150\). Now, substitute \(c = 150 - h\) into \(d = 20 - c\):
\[d = 20 - (150 - h)\]
\[d = h - 130\]

To minimize \(h - p\), \(P\) should be as close to \(D\) as possible. The minimum value of \(h - p\) is \(h - d\), which is 130 meters.

The total length of the original ropes is:

The length of the new rope \(HP\) is 130 meters.

So, the value of the expression is 0 when \(x = y\).

Next, let's consider the case when \(y = 0\). The expression simplifies to:
\[
f(x, 0) = \frac{x - 0}{x^4 + 0^4 + 6} = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \(g(x) = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(g(x)\) and set it to zero:
\[
g'(x) = \frac{(x^4 + 6) \cdot 1 - x \cdot 4x^3}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{x^4 + 6 - 4x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{6 - 3x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2}.
\]
Setting \(g'(x) = 0\), we get:
\[
6 - 3x^4 = 0 \implies x^4 = 2 \implies x = \sqrt[4]{2}.
\]
We substitute \(x = \sqrt[4]{2}\) back into the function \(g(x)\):
\[
g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{(\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}.
\]
Since \(\sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{1/4}\), we have:
\[
g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{2^{1/4}}{8} = \frac{2^{1/4}}{2^3} = 2^{1/4 - 3} = 2^{-11/4} = \frac{1}{2^{11/4}}.
\]
To confirm that this is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test or analyze the behavior of the function as \(x \to \pm \infty\). As \(x \to \pm \infty\), \(g(x) \to 0\), so the maximum value of \(g(x)\) is indeed \(\frac{1}{2^{11/4}}\).

Therefore, the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2^{11/4}}}\).","[1/2**(11/4), '\\frac{1}{2^{11/4}}']",\frac{1}{4},"[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",False

"To solve the equation \(441 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = x\), we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of \(2(21)(19)\).
2. Add the results of \(441\), \(2(21)(19)\), and \(361\) together.

First, let's calculate \(2(21)(19)\):
\[
2(21)(19) = 2 \times 21 \times 19
\]
We can break this down further:
\[
2 \times 21 = 42
\]
\[
42 \times 19 = 42 \times (20 - 1) = 42 \times 20 - 42 \times 1 = 840 - 42 = 798
\]
So, \(2(21)(19) = 798\).

Next, we add \(441\), \(798\), and \(361\) together:
\[
441 + 798 + 361
\]
We can add these step by step:
\[
441 + 798 = 1239
\]
\[
1239 + 361 = 1600
\]
Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{1600}\).

Alternatively, we can recognize that the given expression is a perfect square trinomial. The expression \(441 + 2(21)(19) + 361\) can be rewritten as:
\[
21^2 + 2(21)(19) + 19^2

This is in the form \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\), which is equal to \((a + b)^2\). Here, \(a = 21\) and \(b = 19\), so:
\[
21^2 + 2(21)(19) + 19^2 = (21 + 19)^2 = 40^2 = 1600

"To determine how many possible integer values \( x \) can take such that \( x^3 \) is a positive factor of \( 10! \), we start by finding the prime factorization of \( 10! \). We calculate:

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800
\]

Next, we find the prime factorization of \( 3628800 \):

\[
10! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7
\]

For \( x^3 \) to be a factor of \( 10! \), \( x \) must be of the form \( 2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c \times 7^d \) where \( 3a \leq 8 \), \( 3b \leq 4 \), \( 3c \leq 2 \), and \( 3d \leq 1 \). This gives us the following constraints:

\]

Thus, \( a \) can be 0, 1, or 2, \( b \) can be 0 or 1, and \( c \) and \( d \) can only be 0. The number of possible values for \( x \) is the product of the number of choices for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):

1. **Understand the formula for the arithmetic average**: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we have four numbers, so the arithmetic average is given by:
   \[
   \text{Arithmetic Average} = \frac{7 + 2 + x + 10}{4}

"To solve the problem, we need to find all possible values of \( N \) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Condition:**
   When the students are divided into groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   N \equiv 5 \pmod{8}
   \]
   This means that \( N \) can be written in the form:
   \[
   N = 8k + 5
   \]
   for some integer \( k \).

2. **Second Condition:**
   When the students are divided into groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   N \equiv 3 \pmod{6}
   \]
   This means that \( N \) can be written in the form:
   \[
   N = 6m + 3
   \]
   for some integer \( m \).

3. **Combining the Conditions:**
   We need to find values of \( N \) that satisfy both congruences simultaneously. Therefore, we set the two expressions for \( N \) equal to each other:
   \[
   8k + 5 = 6m + 3
   \]
   Rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   8k - 6m = -2
   \]
   Simplifying further, we have:
   \[
   4k - 3m = -1
   \]

4. **Solving the Diophantine Equation:**
   We need to find integer solutions to the equation \( 4k - 3m = -1 \). We can use the method of successive substitutions or inspection to find a particular solution. Let's try \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   4(2) - 3m = -1 \implies 8 - 3m = -1 \implies 3m = 9 \implies m = 3
   \]
   So, \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 3 \) is a particular solution. The general solution to the Diophantine equation can be written as:
   \[
   k = 2 + 3t
   \]
   \[
   m = 3 + 4t
   \]
   for any integer \( t \).

5. **Finding \( N \):**
   Substitute \( k = 2 + 3t \) back into the expression for \( N \):
   \[
   N = 8k + 5 = 8(2 + 3t) + 5 = 16 + 24t + 5 = 21 + 24t
   \]
   Therefore, \( N \) can be written in the form:
   \[
   N = 21 + 24t
   \]

6. **Finding All Possible Values of \( N \) Less Than 50:**
   We need to find all values of \( t \) such that \( N < 50 \):
   \[
   21 + 24t < 50
   \]
   Subtract 21 from both sides:
   \[
   24t < 29
   \]
   Divide both sides by 24:
   \[
   t < \frac{29}{24} \approx 1.2083
   \]
   Since \( t \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( t \) are \( t = 0 \) and \( t = 1 \).

   - For \( t = 0 \):
     \[
     N = 21 + 24(0) = 21
     \]
   - For \( t = 1 \):
     \[
     N = 21 + 24(1) = 45
     \]

7. **Sum of All Possible Values of \( N \):**
   The possible values of \( N \) are 21 and 45. The sum of these values is:
   \[
   21 + 45 = 66

The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \( P(x) \) by \( x - c \) is \( P(c) \). In this case, we need to find \( P(-2) \).

Let's substitute \( x = -2 \) into the polynomial \( P(x) \):

\[
P(-2) = (5(-2) + 9)^{611} + ((-2) + 5)^{11} + ((-2) - 1)^{11} + 3(-2)^2 + 1
\]

First, simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[

\]
\[
(-2) + 5 = 3
\]
\[
(-2) - 1 = -3
\]
\[
3(-2)^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]

Now substitute these values back into the expression for \( P(-2) \):

\[
P(-2) = (-1)^{611} + 3^{11} + (-3)^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

Next, evaluate each power:

\[
(-1)^{611} = -1 \quad \text{(since 611 is odd)}
\]
\[
3^{11} = 177147
\]
\[
(-3)^{11} = -177147 \quad \text{(since 11 is odd)}

Now substitute these values back into the expression:

Combine the terms:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 0 + 12 + 1 = 12

"Given that \(a, b, c, d\) are distinct complex numbers with \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 0\), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\).

First, note that since \(a, b, c, d\) lie on the unit circle, we can write them as \(a = e^{i\alpha}\), \(b = e^{i\beta}\), \(c = e^{i\gamma}\), and \(d = e^{i\delta}\) for some real angles \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\). The condition \(a + b + c + d = 0\) implies that the sum of these complex numbers is zero, which geometrically means that the points \(a, b, c, d\) form a quadrilateral that is symmetric about the origin.

A natural choice for such points is the vertices of a square inscribed in the unit circle. Let's assume \(a = 1\), \(b = i\), \(c = -1\), and \(d = -i\). These points satisfy \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 1 + i - 1 - i = 0\).

Now, we need to compute the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\):
\[
a + b = 1 + i, \quad a + c = 1 - 1 = 0, \quad a + d = 1 - i,
\]
\[
b + c = i - 1, \quad b + d = i - i = 0, \quad c + d = -1 - i.
\]
Since \(a + c = 0\) and \(b + d = 0\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |(1 + i) \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - i) \cdot (i - 1) \cdot 0 \cdot (-1 - i)| = 0.
\]
This result is not the maximum value, so we need to consider other configurations of the points. Instead, let's consider the points forming a regular tetrahedron on the unit sphere in the complex plane, which is not possible since we are dealing with complex numbers in the plane. However, we can consider the points forming a rectangle inscribed in the unit circle.

Let's assume \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), \(c = i\), and \(d = -i\). These points satisfy \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 1 - 1 + i - i = 0\).

Now, we need to compute the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\):
\[
a + b = 1 - 1 = 0, \quad a + c = 1 + i, \quad a + d = 1 - i,
\]
\[
b + c = -1 + i, \quad b + d = -1 - i, \quad c + d = i - i = 0.
\]
Since \(a + b = 0\) and \(c + d = 0\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |0 \cdot (1 + i) \cdot (1 - i) \cdot (-1 + i) \cdot (-1 - i) \cdot 0| = 0.
\]
This result is still not the maximum value. The correct approach is to consider the points forming a regular tetrahedron in the complex plane, which is not possible. However, the correct configuration is the points forming a regular octagon on the unit circle, which is not possible in the complex plane.

So, the scalars are \(a = -1\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, we can write:

"To determine how many numbers in the first 100 positive integers can be divided by \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. A number that is divisible by all three must be divisible by their LCM.

First, we find the prime factorizations of \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\):
- \(3\) is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(3\).
- \(4 = 2^2\).
- \(5\) is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(5\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(3, 4, 5) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 = 60.
\]

So, we need to find how many multiples of \(60\) are there in the first 100 positive integers. The multiples of \(60\) are \(60, 120, 180, \ldots\). We are only interested in the multiples that are less than or equal to \(100\).

The largest multiple of \(60\) that is less than or equal to \(100\) is \(60\). Therefore, the multiples of \(60\) in the first 100 positive integers are \(60\).

To find the number of these multiples, we can use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the number of terms. Here, \(a_n = 60\), \(a_1 = 60\), and \(d = 60\). Plugging in these values, we get:

"To find the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points \((-5, 5)\) and \((3, 7)\), we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint \(M\) of a line segment with endpoints \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:

\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]

In our case, the coordinates of the points are:
- \((x_1, y_1) = (-5, 5)\)
- \((x_2, y_2) = (3, 7)\)

Now, we can substitute these values into the midpoint formula:

1. Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint:
   \[
   x_M = \frac{-5 + 3}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1
   \]

2. Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint:

"To determine the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that the product \( 240k \) is a perfect cube, we start by finding the prime factorization of 240. We have:

\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5
\]

For \( 240k \) to be a perfect cube, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of 3. Therefore, we need to determine the smallest \( k \) that will make each exponent in the factorization of \( 240k \) a multiple of 3.

The prime factorization of \( 240k \) is:

\[
240k = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times k
\]

To make \( 240k \) a perfect cube, \( k \) must provide the missing factors \( 2^2 \), \( 3^2 \), and \( 5^2 \). Therefore, the smallest \( k \) is:

\[
k = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 25 = 900

The prime factorization of 216000 is:

\[

"To find the area of \(\triangle CDE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure. We know that \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}\) and \(BD = 4BC\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle CDE\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion because they share \(\angle ACB\) and have corresponding angles \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle CDE\) that are equal due to the parallel lines.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their heights from the same vertex. Since \(BD = 4BC\), the total length \(CD = BC + BD = BC + 4BC = 5BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides \(CD\) to \(CB\) is \(5:1\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is \(5^2 = 25\) times the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

"To find the volume of the region \( S \) defined by the equation \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 36 \), we first need to determine the expressions for the distances \( d_1, d_2, \) and \( d_3 \) from a point \( P = (x, y, z) \) to the given planes.

The distance from a point \( (x, y, z) \) to a plane \( ax + by + cz + d = 0 \) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|ax + by + cz + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}.
\]

1. **Distance to the plane \( x - z = 0 \):**
   \[
   d_1 = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   d_1^2 = \frac{(x - z)^2}{2}.
   \]

2. **Distance to the plane \( x - 2y + z = 0 \):**
   \[
   d_2 = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{6}}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   d_2^2 = \frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6}.
   \]

3. **Distance to the plane \( x + y + z = 0 \):**
   \[
   d_3 = \frac{|x + y + z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|x + y + z|}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   d_3^2 = \frac{(x + y + z)^2}{3}.
   \]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the given equation:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = \frac{(x - z)^2}{2} + \frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6} + \frac{(x + y + z)^2}{3} = 36.
\]

To simplify, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6:
\[
\frac{3(x - z)^2}{6} + \frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6} + \frac{2(x + y + z)^2}{6} = 36.
\]
Combining the terms over the common denominator, we get:
\[
\frac{3(x - z)^2 + (x - 2y + z)^2 + 2(x + y + z)^2}{6} = 36.
\]
Multiplying both sides by 6, we obtain:
\[
3(x - z)^2 + (x - 2y + z)^2 + 2(x + y + z)^2 = 216.
\]

Next, we expand each term:
\[
3(x^2 - 2xz + z^2) + (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 2xz - 4yz + z^2) + 2(x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 2xz + 2yz + z^2) = 216.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3x^2 - 6xz + 3z^2 + x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 2xz - 4yz + z^2 + 2x^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 + 4xz + 4yz + 2z^2 = 216.
\]
Simplifying further, we have:
\[
6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 2xz = 216.
\]
Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \frac{1}{3}xz = 36.
\]

To identify the type of surface, we complete the square for the \( xz \) term. We rewrite the equation as:
\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{3}xz + \frac{1}{36}z^2 + y^2 + \frac{35}{36}z^2 = 36.
\]
This can be written as:
\[
\left( x + \frac{1}{6}z \right)^2 + y^2 + \frac{35}{36}z^2 = 36.
\]

This is the equation of an ellipsoid with semi-axes \( a = 6 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = \frac{6}{\sqrt{35/36}} = \frac{36}{\sqrt{35}} \).

The volume \( V \) of an ellipsoid is given by:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi abc.
\]
Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we get:
\[

"Given that \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a 1997th root of unity. The 1997th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{1997} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the non-1 roots satisfy the equation \(x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to compute the sum
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.
\]
Since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), the last term in the sum is \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}\). Thus, the sum becomes
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Next, we consider the sum
\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}}.
\]
To find \(S\), we use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of linear expressions involving roots of unity. For a polynomial \(P(x) = x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1\) with roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{1996}\), the sum
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}
\]
can be found by considering the polynomial \(P(-1 + x)\) and its roots. The polynomial \(P(-1 + x)\) is
\[
(-1 + x)^{1996} + (-1 + x)^{1995} + \cdots + (-1 + x) + 1.
\]
The sum of the reciprocals of the roots of \(P(-1 + x)\) is given by the formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of a polynomial, which is the negative of the coefficient of \(x^{1995}\) divided by the constant term. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of \(1 + \omega^k\) for all 1997th roots of unity except 1 is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, we have
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]
Adding the last term \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(S\), we get

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

The denominator of the function is \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \). We need to solve the equation:

\[ |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| = 0 \]

Since the absolute value of any real number is non-negative, the sum of two absolute values is zero if and only if each absolute value is zero. Therefore, we need to solve the system of equations:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0 \]

First, let's solve \( x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \). We can factor this quadratic equation as follows:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = (x + 4)(x - 1) = 0 \]

So, the solutions are:

\[ x = -4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 \]

Next, let's solve \( x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0 \). We can factor this quadratic equation as follows:

So, the solutions are:

\[ x = -4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -5 \]

The only value of \( x \) that satisfies both equations is \( x = -4 \). Therefore, the denominator \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \) is zero when \( x = -4 \).

\frac{|b - a|}{\sqrt{(a - b)^2 + 1}}
\]

Given that the area is 72, we have:

\[
|c + d| \cdot |b - a| = 72
\]

We now have two equations:

1. \(|d - c| \cdot |b - a| = 18\)
2. \(|c + d| \cdot |b - a| = 72\)

Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:

\[
\frac{|c + d|}{|d - c|} = 4
\]

This implies that \(|c + d| = 4|d - c|\). Let \(d - c = k\), then \(c + d = 4k\). Solving these, we get:

\[
c = \frac{3k}{2}, \quad d = \frac{5k}{2}
\]

Since \(c\) and \(d\) are integers, \(k\) must be even. Let \(k = 2m\), then \(c = 3m\) and \(d = 5m\). Substituting \(d = 5m\) and \(c = 3m\) into the first equation, we get:

\[
|5m - 3m| \cdot |b - a| = 18 \implies 2m \cdot |b - a| = 18 \implies |b - a| = \frac{9}{m}
\]

To minimize \(a + b + c + d\), we choose the smallest possible value for \(m\), which is 1. Then \(|b - a| = 9\). Let \(b = a + 9\). The smallest possible values for \(a\) and \(b\) are 1 and 10, respectively. Therefore, \(c = 3\) and \(d = 5\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(a + b + c + d\) is:

\[
1 + 10 + 3 + 5 = 19

"To determine the measure of \(\angle PQR\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram. We know that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), and we are given the following angle measures: \(\angle PQR = x^\circ\), \(\angle TQR = 2x^\circ\), and \(\angle QRP = 128^\circ\).

Since \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), the angle \(\angle TQR\) is an alternate interior angle to \(\angle PQR\). Therefore, \(\angle TQR = 2x^\circ\) is the same as the angle that is supplementary to \(\angle PQR\) on the other side of the transversal \(QR\). However, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

In \(\triangle PQR\), the sum of the interior angles is:
\[
\angle PQR + \angle TQR + \angle QRP = 180^\circ
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
x + 2x + 128 = 180
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
3x + 128 = 180
\]
To isolate \(x\), we subtract 128 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 52
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(d\) between the origin \((0, 0)\) and the point \((x, y)\) is given by the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \right)^2} \]

To minimize \(d\), it is equivalent to minimize \(d^2\):

\[ d^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \right)^2 \]

Let \( f(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \right)^2 \). We need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero. First, we expand \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 9x^2 + 81 \right) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 8x^2 + 81 \]

Next, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \):

\[ f'(x) = x^3 - 16x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[ x^3 - 16x = 0 \]
\[ x(x^2 - 16) = 0 \]
\[ x(x - 4)(x + 4) = 0 \]

So, the critical points are \( x = 0 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( x = -4 \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - 8(0)^2 + 81 = 81 \]

2. For \( x = 4 \):

\[ f(4) = \frac{1}{4}(4)^4 - 8(4)^2 + 81 = \frac{1}{4}(256) - 8(16) + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17 \]

3. For \( x = -4 \):

\[ f(-4) = \frac{1}{4}(-4)^4 - 8(-4)^2 + 81 = \frac{1}{4}(256) - 8(16) + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17 \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 17, which occurs at \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -4 \). Therefore, the minimum distance squared \( a^2 \) is:

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be expanded and rearranged as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We solve this quadratic congruence by using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). However, \( t = 4 \) is even, so the only odd solution is:

\[ t = 17 \]

To verify, we check if \( t + 2 = 19 \) is the modular inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:

\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, \( t = 17 \) is indeed the solution. The unique odd integer \( t \) is:

1. **Find the \(x\)-intercept \(a\):**
   The \(x\)-intercept is the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\). Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{x}{4} = 1 \implies x = 4
   \]
   So, the \(x\)-intercept \(a\) is 4.

2. **Find the \(y\)-intercept \(b\):**
   The \(y\)-intercept is the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies y = 12

3. **Find the slope \(m\):**
   The equation of the line is given in the intercept form \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\). To find the slope, we can convert this equation to the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\). Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1

   Multiply every term by 12 to clear the denominators:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can arrange 6 distinct vehicles into 3 lanes (left turn, straight, right turn) such that each lane is occupied.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have 6 distinct vehicles and 3 lanes. Each lane must have at least one vehicle. The order of vehicles matters since the first vehicle left of the second vehicle is different from the second vehicle left of the first vehicle.

### Step 2: Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of ways to distribute the vehicles into the lanes such that no lane is empty.

1. **Total ways to distribute 6 vehicles into 3 lanes**: 
   Each vehicle has 3 choices (left, straight, right). Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the vehicles is:
   \[

2. **Calculating \(3^6\)**:
   \[
   3^6 = 729

3. **Calculating the cases where at least one lane is empty**:
   - **Case 1**: One lane is empty. We can choose which lane is empty in \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) ways. The remaining 2 lanes can be filled by the 6 vehicles in \(2^6\) ways.
   \[
   3 \times 2^6 = 3 \times 64 = 192
   \]

   - **Case 2**: Two lanes are empty. We can choose which two lanes are empty in \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways. The remaining 1 lane can be filled by the 6 vehicles in \(1^6\) way.
   \[
   3 \times 1^6 = 3 \times 1 = 3
   \]

4. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion**:
   The number of ways to distribute the vehicles such that no lane is empty is given by:
   \[
   \text{Total ways} - \text{Ways with at least one lane empty} + \text{Ways with at least two lanes empty}

Since \( BEFH \) is a rectangle and \( BE = 5 \), point \( E \) is at \((3,3)\) and point \( B \) is at \((3,0)\), point \( F \) must be at \((3,5)\) and point \( H \) must be at \((x,5)\) for some \( x \).

"To determine the number of different ways to arrange 2 indistinguishable IMO gold medals and 2 indistinguishable IPhO gold medals in a row, we need to find the number of distinct permutations of the multiset {IMO, IMO, IPhO, IPhO}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

In this problem, we have 4 items in total (2 IMO and 2 IPhO), so \( n = 4 \). The frequency of IMO is 2 and the frequency of IPhO is also 2, so \( n_1 = 2 \) and \( n_2 = 2 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we calculate the factorials:

\[

\[

"To find the modular inverse of \(997\) modulo \(1000\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[997x = 1000k + 1\]

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). This can be rewritten as:

\[997x - 1000k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(997\) and \(1000\):

\[1000 = 1 \cdot 997 + 3\]
\[997 = 332 \cdot 3 + 1\]
\[3 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(997\) and \(1000\) are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(997\) and \(1000\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 3\]

Substitute \(3\) from the first equation:

\[3 = 1000 - 1 \cdot 997\]

So,

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot (1000 - 1 \cdot 997)\]
\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 1000 + 332 \cdot 997\]
\[1 = 997 + 332 \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]
\[1 = (1 + 332) \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]
\[1 = 333 \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]

From this, we can see that:

\[333 \cdot 997 \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\]

"To convert the repeating decimal \(0.\overline{1331}\) into a fraction, we start by letting \(x = 0.\overline{1331}\). This means that \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\).

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by \(10000\) to shift the decimal point four places to the right:
\[10000x = 1331.133113311331\ldots\]

Now, we subtract the original equation \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\) from this new equation:
\[10000x - x = 1331.133113311331\ldots - 0.133113311331\ldots\]
\[9999x = 1331\]
\[x = \frac{1331}{9999}\]

Next, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{1331}{9999}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1331 and 9999. First, we find the prime factorizations of 1331 and 9999:
\[1331 = 11^3\]
\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11^2 \times 101\]

The GCD of 1331 and 9999 is \(11^2 = 121\). We divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by 121:
\[\frac{1331 \div 121}{9999 \div 121} = \frac{11}{83}\]

Thus, the fraction representation of \(0.\overline{1331}\) in its simplest form is \(\frac{11}{83}\). Here, \(a = 11\) and \(b = 83\), and the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To find the perimeter of the set \( S \), we need to consider the set of all points inside a regular nine-sided polygon (nonagon) with side length 2 units, and all points that are within a distance of 1 unit from any point on the perimeter of the nonagon.

First, let's analyze the nonagon itself. A regular nonagon has 9 equal sides, each of length 2 units. The perimeter of the nonagon is:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ units}
\]

Next, we need to consider the additional points that are within a distance of 1 unit from the perimeter of the nonagon. These points form a region that extends 1 unit outward from each side of the nonagon and also around the corners of the nonagon.

The additional perimeter contributed by the extensions along the sides is simply the perimeter of a larger nonagon with each side length increased by 2 units (1 unit on each side). Therefore, the side length of the larger nonagon is:
\[
2 + 2 \times 1 = 4 \text{ units}
\]
The perimeter of the larger nonagon is:
\[
9 \times 4 = 36 \text{ units}
\]

However, we must also account for the additional perimeter contributed by the extensions around the corners. Each corner of the original nonagon forms a quarter-circle with a radius of 1 unit. Since there are 9 corners, the total additional perimeter from the corners is the perimeter of 9 quarter-circles, which is equivalent to the perimeter of a full circle with radius 1 unit:
\[
2 \pi \times 1 = 2 \pi \text{ units}
\]

Therefore, the total perimeter of the set \( S \) is the sum of the perimeter of the larger nonagon and the additional perimeter from the corners:

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

\[ 120 - \sqrt{x} = k^2. \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \(\sqrt{x}\), we get

\[ \sqrt{x} = 120 - k^2. \]

Since \(\sqrt{x}\) must be a non-negative real number, it follows that

\[ 120 - k^2 \geq 0. \]

This inequality can be rewritten as

\[ k^2 \leq 120. \]

The largest integer \( k \) that satisfies this inequality is 10, because \( 10^2 = 100 \) and \( 11^2 = 121 \). Therefore, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 10, inclusive. This gives us 11 possible values for \( k \):

\[ k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. \]

For each of these values of \( k \), there is a corresponding non-negative value of \(\sqrt{x}\), and hence a unique non-negative value of \( x \). Specifically,

\[ x = (120 - k^2)^2. \]

Thus, there are 11 real values of \( x \) that satisfy the original condition. Therefore, the number of real values of \( x \) for which \(\sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}}\) is an integer is

1. The area of the innermost circle (radius 4) is:
   \[
   A_1 = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi

   This area corresponds to region \(X\).

2. The area of the middle circle (radius 6) is:

   The area of region \(Y\) is the area of the middle circle minus the area of the innermost circle:

3. The area of the outermost circle (radius 7) is:

   The area of region \(Z\) is the area of the outermost circle minus the area of the middle circle:

\[
a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab = 2a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + ab = 2ab
\]

So, the expression simplifies to \(2ab\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are different prime numbers greater than 2, both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd primes. Therefore, \(2ab\) is an even number and can be factored as \(2 \times a \times b\).

To find the number of integer divisors of \(2ab\), we use the property of divisors that if a number \(n\) has a prime factorization of the form \(p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\), then the number of divisors of \(n\) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\).

First, we consider the sum without any constraints:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.
\]
This sum can be factored as:
\[

\[

\[

However, this is the sum over all positive integer triples \((a, b, c)\) without any constraints, and we need to exclude the triples that do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

To find the sum over the valid triples, we need to consider the constraints \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\). This is a more complex task, but we can use a known result from combinatorial geometry and number theory.

"To determine after how many seconds the markings on both gears will again simultaneously point to the north, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rotations per minute for each gear and then convert that time into seconds.

First, let's convert the number of rotations per minute for the first gear into an improper fraction:
\[ 33\frac{1}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \]

The number of rotations per minute for the second gear is already an integer:
\[ 45 \]

Next, we need to find the LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and 45. To do this, we first find the LCM of the numerators (100 and 45) and the GCD (greatest common divisor) of the denominators (3 and 1).

The prime factorization of 100 is \(2^2 \times 5^2\).
The prime factorization of 45 is \(3^2 \times 5\).

The LCM of 100 and 45 is:
\[ \text{LCM}(100, 45) = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 25 = 900 \]

The GCD of 3 and 1 is 1.

Therefore, the LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and 45 is:

This means that the two gears will both complete a whole number of rotations simultaneously after 900 minutes.

To convert 900 minutes into seconds, we use the following conversions:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \((a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right)\), we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality. The AM-HM inequality states that for any positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n}}.
\]

Applying this inequality to the four variables \(a, b, c, d\), we get

\[
\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain

\[
a + b + c + d \geq \frac{16}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}\), we get

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) \geq 16.
\]

The equality in the AM-HM inequality holds if and only if \(a = b = c = d\). Let \(a = b = c = d = k\), where \(k\) is a positive real number. Substituting these values into the expression, we get

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) = (k + k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) = 4k \cdot \frac{4}{k} = 16.

"To solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} = 4r-3\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(2r-7\):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r-3)(2r-7).
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
(4r-3)(2r-7) = 4r \cdot 2r + 4r \cdot (-7) + (-3) \cdot 2r + (-3) \cdot (-7) = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

Now, we set the expanded form equal to the left-hand side of the original equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

To simplify, we move all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0.
\]

We can multiply the entire equation by \(-1\) to make the leading coefficient positive:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0.
\]

Next, we factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \cdot 28 = 56\) and add up to \(-15\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(-8\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r - 4 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
r = \frac{7}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4.
\]

However, we must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they do not make the denominator zero. The original equation is:

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} = 4r-3.
\]

If \(r = \frac{7}{2}\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is zero, so \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is not a valid solution. If \(r = 4\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is \(2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \neq 0\), so \(r = 4\) is a valid solution.

Therefore, the value of \(r\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle**: 
   - The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\).
   - The width of the rectangle is \(5 - (-5) = 10\) units.
   - The height of the rectangle is \(4 - (-4) = 8\) units.

2. **Calculate the total area of the rectangle**:
   - The area \(A\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 10 \times 8 = 80.
     \]

3. **Determine the number of integer points**:
   - The integer points in a rectangle can be found by considering the integer coordinates within the bounds of the rectangle.
   - The integer \(x\) values range from \(-5\) to \(5\), which gives us \(5 - (-5) + 1 = 11\) integer points in the \(x\)-direction.
   - The integer \(y\) values range from \(-4\) to \(4\), which gives us \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) integer points in the \(y\)-direction.

4. **Calculate the total number of integer points**:

"To solve the system of inequalities \(0 \ge 54p - 144\) and \(0 > 12 - 20p\), we will solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solution sets.

First, let's solve the inequality \(0 \ge 54p - 144\):
\[
0 \ge 54p - 144
\]
Add 144 to both sides:
\[
144 \ge 54p
\]
Divide both sides by 54:
\[
\frac{144}{54} \ge p
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \ge p
\]
or equivalently,
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(0 > 12 - 20p\):
\[
0 > 12 - 20p
\]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
-12 > -20p
\]
Divide both sides by -20 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[
\frac{-12}{-20} < p

Simplify the fraction:
\[

"To solve the equation \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \), we start by rewriting it in a more convenient form. Notice that the coefficients suggest a pattern similar to the binomial expansion of \( (z+i)^4 \). Let's expand \( (z+i)^4 \):

\[
(z+i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + 1
\]

So, the given equation can be rewritten as:

\[
z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = (z+i)^4 - 1 - i = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(z+i)^4 = 1 + i
\]

Next, we need to find the fourth roots of \( 1 + i \). First, we express \( 1 + i \) in polar form. The magnitude of \( 1 + i \) is:

\[
|1+i| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}
\]

The argument of \( 1 + i \) is:

\[
\arg(1+i) = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

So, we can write \( 1 + i \) as:

\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right)
\]

The fourth roots of \( 1 + i \) are given by:

\[
z_k = \sqrt[4]{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{\frac{\pi}{4} + 2k\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\frac{\pi}{4} + 2k\pi}{4} \right) = 2^{1/8} \left( \cos \frac{\pi + 8k\pi}{16} + i \sin \frac{\pi + 8k\pi}{16} \right)
\]

for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \). Therefore, the fourth roots are:

\[
z_0 = 2^{1/8} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{16} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{16} \right)
\]
\[
z_1 = 2^{1/8} \left( \cos \frac{9\pi}{16} + i \sin \frac{9\pi}{16} \right)
\]
\[
z_2 = 2^{1/8} \left( \cos \frac{17\pi}{16} + i \sin \frac{17\pi}{16} \right)
\]
\[
z_3 = 2^{1/8} \left( \cos \frac{25\pi}{16} + i \sin \frac{25\pi}{16} \right)
\]

These roots are the vertices of a square in the complex plane with side length \( 2^{1/8} \sqrt{2} = 2^{5/8} \). The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area is:

\[
\left( 2^{5/8} \right)^2 = 2^{5/4}
\]

Thus, the area can be written as \( p^{a/b} \) where \( p = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 4 \). Therefore, \( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \).

"To determine which equation has the largest solution for \( x \), we need to analyze the equations and compare the bases of the exponential terms. The general form of the equations is \( 3(1 + a)^x = 7 \), where \( a \) is a function of \( r \). The solution for \( x \) can be found by isolating the exponential term and then taking the logarithm of both sides:

\[ (1 + a)^x = \frac{7}{3} \]
\[ x \log(1 + a) = \log\left(\frac{7}{3}\right) \]
\[ x = \frac{\log\left(\frac{7}{3}\right)}{\log(1 + a)} \]

Since \( \log\left(\frac{7}{3}\right) \) is a constant, the value of \( x \) depends on the value of \( \log(1 + a) \). The larger the value of \( \log(1 + a) \), the smaller the value of \( x \). Therefore, we need to find the smallest value of \( 1 + a \) among the given options.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) \( 1 + r \)
(B) \( 1 + \frac{r}{10} \)
(C) \( 1 + 2r \)
(D) \( 1 + \sqrt{r} \)
(E) \( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \)

Since \( 0 < r < 3 \):
- \( 1 + r \) is between 1 and 4.
- \( 1 + \frac{r}{10} \) is between 1 and 1.3.
- \( 1 + 2r \) is between 1 and 7.
- \( 1 + \sqrt{r} \) is between 1 and \( 1 + \sqrt{3} \approx 2.732 \).
- \( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \) is between \( 1 + \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.333 \) and infinity.

The smallest value among these is \( 1 + \frac{r}{10} \), which is between 1 and 1.3. Therefore, the largest value of \( x \) will be obtained from the equation \( 3(1 + \frac{r}{10})^x = 7 \).

   - The width of the rectangle is from \(-5\) to \(5\), which is \(10\) units.

"To determine the range of the function \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the logarithm and then apply the properties of the logarithmic function.

1. **Identify the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\):**
   - The sine function, \(\sin x\), is positive in the interval \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\).
   - The minimum value of \(\sin x\) in this interval is \(\sin 0^\circ = 0\) ( approached as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\)), and the maximum value is \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\).

2. **Determine the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\):**
   - Since the square root function is increasing and defined for positive inputs, the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\) will be \(\sqrt{0} < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq \sqrt{1}\), which simplifies to \(0 < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq 1\).

"To factor the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) into the form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), we need to find the values of \(A\) and \(B\) such that the expanded form matches the original expression.

First, let's expand \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\):
\[
(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24 = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24.
\]
We need this to be equal to \(10x^2 - x - 24\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:
\[
AB = 10,
\]
\[
3A - 8B = -1.
\]

We will solve this system step by step. First, solve the first equation for \(A\):
\[
A = \frac{10}{B}.
\]

Next, substitute \(A = \frac{10}{B}\) into the second equation:
\[
3\left(\frac{10}{B}\right) - 8B = -1.
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
\frac{30}{B} - 8B = -1.
\]
To clear the fraction, multiply every term by \(B\):
\[
30 - 8B^2 = -B.
\]
Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:
\[
8B^2 - B - 30 = 0.
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 8\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -30\):
\[
B = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-30)}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16} = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}.
\]
This gives us two possible solutions for \(B\):
\[
B = \frac{1 + 31}{16} = \frac{32}{16} = 2,
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 - 31}{16} = \frac{-30}{16} = -\frac{15}{8}.
\]
Since \(B\) must be an integer, we have \(B = 2\). Now substitute \(B = 2\) back into the equation \(A = \frac{10}{B}\):
\[
A = \frac{10}{2} = 5.
\]
Thus, \(A = 5\) and \(B = 2\). We need to find the value of \(AB + B\):
\[
AB + B = 5 \cdot 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(AB + B\) is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} \), we will first analyze the expression and then evaluate it at specific points to identify its properties.

First, observe that each term in the polynomial is a quadratic polynomial divided by a constant. Therefore, each term is a quadratic polynomial in \( x \). Since the sum of quadratic polynomials is also a quadratic polynomial, \( p(x) \) is at most a quadratic polynomial.

Next, we will evaluate \( p(x) \) at the points \( x = a \), \( x = b \), and \( x = c \) to determine the coefficients of the polynomial.

1. Evaluate \( p(a) \):
\[
p(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
\]

2. Evaluate \( p(b) \):
\[
p(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.
\]

3. Evaluate \( p(c) \):
\[
p(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

From the evaluations, we see that \( p(a) = 1 \), \( p(b) = 1 \), and \( p(c) = 1 \). This means that the polynomial \( p(x) \) takes the value 1 at three distinct points \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Since a polynomial of degree \( n \) can have at most \( n \) roots, and \( p(x) - 1 \) is a polynomial of degree at most 2 that has three roots \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), it must be the zero polynomial. Therefore, \( p(x) = 1 \) for all \( x \).

"To solve the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \), we first isolate the absolute value expression. Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ |x-4| = 12 \]

The absolute value equation \( |x-4| = 12 \) means that \( x-4 \) can be either 12 or -12. Therefore, we can write two separate equations:

1. \( x-4 = 12 \)
2. \( x-4 = -12 \)

We solve each equation separately.

\[ x-4 = 12 \]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

For the second equation:
\[ x-4 = -12 \]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

The solutions to the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \) are \( x = 16 \) and \( x = -8 \). To find the product of these solutions, we multiply them together:

"To find \(\cos \angle RPS\), we start by noting that \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are supplementary angles because they form a straight line. Therefore, we have:

\[
\angle RPS = 180^\circ - \angle RPQ
\]

The cosine of a supplementary angle can be expressed as:

\[
\cos(180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta
\]

So, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPQ\) first. We know that:

\[
\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we can find \(\cos \angle RPQ\):

\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \sin^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}

Taking the positive square root (since \(\angle RPQ\) is in the first quadrant where cosine is positive), we get:

\[
\cos \angle RPQ = \frac{24}{25}
\]

Now, using the property of the cosine of a supplementary angle, we have:

\[
\cos \angle RPS = \cos(180^\circ - \angle RPQ) = -\cos \angle RPQ = -\frac{24}{25}

Thus, the value of \(\cos \angle RPS\) is:

   \[
   q(x) = bx + 1

   Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the function \( q(x) \), we get:

"To find the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we need to analyze the given information and use the properties of circles and sectors.

1. **Identify the areas of the circles:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   - The shaded region is part of the larger circle and part of the smaller circle.
   - The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - Therefore, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

3. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   - Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians.
   - The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta\).

4. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

5. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded region:**
   - The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the sectors of the larger and smaller circles.
   - Therefore, we have \(2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - Combine the terms on the left side: \(\frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}\).

   - Since \(\pi\) radians is \(180^\circ\), \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians is \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ\).

"To determine how many cylindrical burners are needed to fill a spherical water tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical burners and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical burner. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical burner, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical water tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, to find out how many cylindrical burners are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical burner:

"To determine the number of different values in the range of the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for \( x \in [0, \infty) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the floor function and how the floor function affects it.

First, let's consider the expression \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \). For \( x \) to be a real number, \( x \) must be an even integer because raising a negative number to an odd power results in a negative number, and the floor function of a negative number is not defined in the context of this problem (since the floor function of a negative number is not a real number in the context of this problem).

So, let's consider \( x = 2k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer. Then the expression becomes \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^{2k} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2k} \). This is a positive number and it decreases as \( k \) increases.

Now, let's evaluate \( f(x) \) for the first few values of \( k \):

1. For \( k = 0 \), \( x = 0 \) and \( f(0) = \left\lfloor \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^0 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1 \).
2. For \( k = 1 \), \( x = 2 \) and \( f(2) = \left\lfloor \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^2 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{64} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.390625 \right\rfloor = 0 \).
3. For \( k = 2 \), \( x = 4 \) and \( f(4) = \left\lfloor \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^4 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{625}{4096} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.152587890625 \right\rfloor = 0 \).

We observe that for \( k \geq 1 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2k} < 1 \) and it decreases as \( k \) increases. Therefore, \( f(2k) = 0 \) for all \( k \geq 1 \).

Thus, the only different values in the range of \( f(x) \) are 1 and 0. Therefore, the number of different values in the range of \( f(x) \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False

First, simplify each term in the numerator:
1. Simplify \(\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{16 \cdot 5}} = \dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5\sqrt{5}}{20} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.

3. Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
   \]

Now, substitute these simplified terms back into the numerator:
\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\sqrt{5}.

To add these terms, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Rewrite each term with the denominator 36:
\[

\[
\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} = \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36},

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}.

So, the expression inside the square root becomes:

\]

We can rewrite this expression by adding and subtracting \(xyz\):

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz = y(x + y + z) + xz.

Given the constraint \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\), we can substitute \(x + y + z\) with \(\frac{1}{xyz}\):

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = y \cdot \frac{1}{xyz} + xz = \frac{y}{xyz} + xz = \frac{1}{xz} + xz.
\]

Now, let \(t = xz\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = \frac{1}{t} + t.
\]

To find the minimum value of \(\frac{1}{t} + t\), we take the derivative with respect to \(t\) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{t} + t \right) = -\frac{1}{t^2} + 1 = 0.

To confirm that this is a minimum, we check the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left( \frac{1}{t} + t \right) = \frac{2}{t^3}.

Since \(\frac{2}{t^3} > 0\) for \(t > 0\), the function \(\frac{1}{t} + t\) has a local minimum at \(t = 1\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(\frac{1}{t} + t\) is:

\]

First, we need to determine the integer part \( a \) of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \). Since \( 1^3 = 1 \) and \( 2^3 = 8 \), it follows that \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \). Therefore, the integer part \( a \) is 1. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

Next, we isolate the fractional part by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[

\]

Now, we need to find the reciprocal of \( \sqrt[3]{2} - 1 \):

\[
b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{2 - 1} = \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1

So, we have:

\[

The integer part of \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \) is 3, because \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \) and \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{4} < 2 \), so \( 3 < \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 < 5 \). Therefore, the integer part \( b \) is 3. So, we can write:

"To convert the decimal number \(999_{10}\) to its six进制 equivalent, we need to repeatedly divide the number by 6 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will form the digits of the six进制 number, read from bottom to top.

Here are the steps:

1. Divide 999 by 6:
   \[
   999 \div 6 = 166 \text{ remainder } 3
   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 3.

2. Divide 166 by 6:
   \[
   166 \div 6 = 27 \text{ remainder } 4
   \]
   So, the next digit is 4.

3. Divide 27 by 6:
   \[

   So, the next digit is 3.

4. Divide 4 by 6:
   \[

   So, the next digit is 4.

Since the quotient is now 0, we stop the division process. Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the six进制 number \(4343_6\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the equation of the reflected parabola and then sum the coefficients of the resulting equation in terms of \( k \).

1. **Original Equation and Vertex:**
   The original equation of the parabola is given by:
   \[
   y = ax^2 + bx + c
   \]
   The vertex form of a parabola is:
   \[
   y = a(x - h)^2 + k
   \]
   where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. We can convert the original equation to vertex form by completing the square. The vertex \( h \) is given by:
   \[
   h = -\frac{b}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting \( h \) into the original equation, we get:
   \[
   y = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - a\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a}
   \]
   Therefore, the vertex form is:
   \[
   y = a\left(x - h\right)^2 + k
   \]
   where \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \).

2. **Reflection about the Line \( y = k \):**
   Reflecting the parabola \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) about the line \( y = k \) means that each point \((x, y)\) on the original parabola will be mapped to the point \((x, 2k - y)\). Substituting \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) into this transformation, we get:
   \[
   y = 2k - \left(a(x - h)^2 + k\right) = k - a(x - h)^2
   \]
   Expanding this, we have:
   \[
   y = k - a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) = k - ax^2 + 2ahx - ah^2
   \]
   Therefore, the equation of the reflected parabola is:
   \[
   y = -ax^2 + 2ahx + \left(k - ah^2\right)
   \]
   Comparing this with the standard form \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \), we identify:
   \[
   d = -a, \quad e = 2ah, \quad f = k - ah^2
   \]

3. **Sum of the Coefficients:**
   We need to find \( a + b + c + d + e + f \). Substituting the values of \( d \), \( e \), and \( f \), we get:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c - a + 2ah + k - ah^2
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e + f = b + c + 2ah + k - ah^2
   \]
   Recall that \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \), so:
   \[
   2ah = 2a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) = -b
   \]
   and
   \[
   ah^2 = a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = a\left(\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right) = \frac{b^2}{4a}
   \]
   Substituting these into the expression, we get:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e + f = b + c - b + k - \frac{b^2}{4a} = c + k - \frac{b^2}{4a}
   \]
   Since \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \), we have:
   \[
   c + k - \frac{b^2}{4a} = c + \left(c - \frac{b^2}{4a}\right) - \frac{b^2}{4a} = 2c - \frac{b^2}{2a}
   \]
   But we know that \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \), so:
   \[
   c = k + \frac{b^2}{4a}
   \]
   Substituting this into the expression, we get:
   \[
   2c - \frac{b^2}{2a} = 2\left(k + \frac{b^2}{4a}\right) - \frac{b^2}{2a} = 2k + \frac{b^2}{2a} - \frac{b^2}{2a} = 2k

First, let's solve the left part of the inequality:
\[
\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7}
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7):
\[
7 < 4x
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[
\frac{7}{4} < x

\[
1.75 < x

Since \( x \) is an integer, we have:
\[
x > 1.75 \implies x \geq 2

Now, let's solve the right part of the inequality:

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[
x < \frac{7}{3}

\[

The function \(f(n)\) is defined as:
\[ f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n+3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n-12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^-} f(n) = 4a + 3. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^+} f(n) = 7a - 12. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(n = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12. \]

Now, we solve this equation for \(a\):
\[ 3 + 12 = 7a - 4a, \]

"To find the value of \( t(g(16)) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine the value of \( g(16) \).
2. Then, use the value obtained from step 1 to find \( t(g(16)) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = \sqrt{x} \]
So, we substitute \( x = 16 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

Now, we move to step 2. The function \( t(x) \) is given by:
\[ t(x) = 3 - g(x) \]
But since we need \( t(g(16)) \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) into the function \( t(x) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - g(4) \]
First, we need to find \( g(4) \):
\[ g(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
So, we substitute \( g(4) = 2 \) back into the function \( t(4) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}\), we start by introducing a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(s = a + b\) and \(t = c\). The expression then becomes:

\[
\frac{(s + t)[s^2 + (s + 4t)^2]}{abt}.
\]

Next, we need to express \(ab\) in terms of \(s\) and \(t\). Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), we have:

\[
a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab} \implies s \geq 2\sqrt{ab} \implies ab \leq \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{s^2}{4}.
\]

Thus, the expression is at least:

\[
\frac{(s + t)[s^2 + (s + 4t)^2]}{\frac{s^2}{4} t} = \frac{4(s + t)[s^2 + (s + 4t)^2]}{s^2 t}.
\]

Now, we expand the expression inside the brackets:

\[
s^2 + (s + 4t)^2 = s^2 + s^2 + 8st + 16t^2 = 2s^2 + 8st + 16t^2.
\]

Substituting this back into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{4(s + t)(2s^2 + 8st + 16t^2)}{s^2 t}.
\]

We can expand the numerator:

\[
4(s + t)(2s^2 + 8st + 16t^2) = 4(2s^3 + 8s^2 t + 16st^2 + 2s^2 t + 8st^2 + 16t^3) = 4(2s^3 + 10s^2 t + 24st^2 + 16t^3) = 8s^3 + 40s^2 t + 96st^2 + 64t^3.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{8s^3 + 40s^2 t + 96st^2 + 64t^3}{s^2 t} = \frac{8s^3}{s^2 t} + \frac{40s^2 t}{s^2 t} + \frac{96st^2}{s^2 t} + \frac{64t^3}{s^2 t} = \frac{8s}{t} + 40 + \frac{96t}{s} + \frac{64t^2}{s^2}.
\]

To find the minimum value, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers or look for critical points by setting the partial derivatives with respect to \(s\) and \(t\) to zero. However, a simpler approach is to test the case when \(a = b\) and \(c = \frac{a}{4}\). Let \(a = b = x\) and \(c = \frac{x}{4}\). Then \(s = 2x\) and \(t = \frac{x}{4}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{(2x + \frac{x}{4})[(2x)^2 + (2x + 4 \cdot \frac{x}{4})^2]}{x \cdot x \cdot \frac{x}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9x}{4}\right)[4x^2 + (2x + x)^2]}{\frac{x^3}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9x}{4}\right)[4x^2 + 9x^2]}{\frac{x^3}{4}} = \frac{\left(\frac{9x}{4}\right) \cdot 13x^2}{\frac{x^3}{4}} = \frac{117x^3}{x^3} = 117.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Since \(x^4 \geq 0\) and \(4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative and never less than \(-4\). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) holds for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x - 6}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{(x - 6)^2}{4}.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{4} + y^2 = 10.
\]

3. **Multiply through by 4**: To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 4:

\[
(x - 6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40.
\]

4. **Rearranging the equation**: We can rearrange this to match the standard form of an ellipse:

\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1.
\]

5. **Identify the conic section**: The equation is now in the standard form of an ellipse, which is 

\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1,
\]

where \(a^2 = 40\) and \(b^2 = 10\).

6. **Conclusion**: Since the equation represents an ellipse, we conclude that the graph of the given equation is an ellipse.

Thus, the final answer is

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and the given equations to derive the desired value.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.
\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(xy + yz + zx\) and \(x + y + z\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[
-8 = (x + y + z)((x + y + z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.
\]
Given that this expression equals 12, we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[

Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(sp = 24\), we get:

The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) of a line passing through two points \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\ y_2 - y_1 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \), we get:
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find a vector that is parallel to \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\) and has the form \(\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix}\). Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, there exists a scalar \( k \) such that:

"To find the equation of the set of points that are the reflections of the points on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) about the point \((4,1)\), we start by determining the coordinates of the reflected point. Let \((x_1, y_1)\) be a point on the circle, and let \((x_2, y_2)\) be its reflection about the point \((4,1)\). The midpoint of the segment joining \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \((4,1)\). Therefore, we have the equations:
\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 1.
\]
Solving these equations for \(x_2\) and \(y_2\), we get:
\[
x_2 = 8 - x_1 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = 2 - y_1.
\]
Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), we substitute \(x_1 = 8 - x_2\) and \(y_1 = 2 - y_2\) into the circle's equation:
\[
(8 - x_2)^2 + (2 - y_2)^2 = 25.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
64 - 16x_2 + x_2^2 + 4 - 4y_2 + y_2^2 = 25.
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 - 16x_2 - 4y_2 + 68 = 25.

Subtracting 25 from both sides, we obtain:
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 - 16x_2 - 4y_2 + 43 = 0.

"Given that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers such that \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3\), we start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers, which states that \(ab = \gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b]\). Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
ab = 210 \cdot 210^3 = 210^4.
\]
Since \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\), we can write \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\) where \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation \(ab = 210^4\), we get:
\[
(210m)(210n) = 210^4 \implies 210^2mn = 210^4 \implies mn = 210^2.
\]
Next, we factorize \(210^2\):
\[
210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \implies 210^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2.
\]
We need to find the number of pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\) and \(mn = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2\). Each prime factor must be entirely in either \(m\) or \(n\). Therefore, there are \(2^4 = 16\) ways to assign the prime factors to \(m\) and \(n\). These pairs \((m, n)\) correspond to the pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\).

Since \(a < b\), we only consider the pairs where \(m < n\). Out of the 16 pairs \((m, n)\), exactly half satisfy \(m < n\) (the other half satisfy \(m > n\), and the pair \((m, n) = (1, 1)\) is not possible since \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\) and \(m \neq n\)).

"To find the maximum possible value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) given that \( |ax^2 + bx + c| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), we start by considering the polynomial \( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) and its values at the endpoints and the midpoint of the interval \([0, 1]\). Specifically, we evaluate \( P(x) \) at \( x = 0 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

First, we have:
\[ P(0) = c, \]
\[ P(1) = a + b + c, \]
\[ P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c. \]

Since \( |P(x)| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), it follows that:
\[ |c| \le 1, \]
\[ |a + b + c| \le 1, \]
\[ \left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \right| \le 1. \]

We need to find the maximum value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) under these constraints. To do this, we consider the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, \( T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1 \), which is known to oscillate between -1 and 1 on the interval \([-1, 1]\). By scaling and shifting this polynomial, we can find a polynomial that oscillates between -1 and 1 on the interval \([0, 1]\).

Consider the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \). We evaluate this polynomial at the endpoints and the midpoint:
\[ P(0) = 1, \]
\[ P(1) = 1, \]
\[ P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1. \]

Thus, \( |P(x)| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \). For this polynomial, we have:
\[ |a| = 8, \]
\[ |b| = 8, \]
\[ |c| = 1. \]

Therefore, the maximum possible value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) is:
\[ |a| + |b| + |c| = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17. \]

To confirm that this is indeed the maximum, we note that any other polynomial that satisfies the given condition will have coefficients that are less extreme than those of \( 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \) in terms of their absolute values, or will not achieve the same oscillation pattern. Hence, the maximum value is achieved by the polynomial \( 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \).

\[
\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{(-3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}

First, we calculate the denominator:

\[
(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i^2 = 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5

     \[
     546 \div 2 = 273 \quad \text{(even)}

     So, \( 1092 = 2^2 \times 273 \).
   - Next, check \( 273 \) for divisibility by \( 3 \):
     \[
     2 + 7 + 3 = 12 \quad \text{(divisible by 3)}

     \[
     273 \div 3 = 91

     So, \( 273 = 3 \times 91 \).
   - Now, check \( 91 \) for divisibility by \( 5 \) (not divisible), then by \( 7 \):
     \[
     91 \div 7 = 13 \quad \text{(divisible by 7)}

Since \( P \) lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) as \( y = -x + 6 \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (x, -x + 6) \).

The distance \( PA \) from \( P \) to \( A(10, -10) \) is given by the distance formula:
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + ((-x + 6) + 10)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2}

Expanding the squares, we get:

Since \( PA = PO \), we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[

Subtracting \( 2x^2 \) from both sides, we obtain:

Adding \( 52x \) to both sides, we get:

\[4\$ = \underbrace{24^{24^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{24}}}}}}_{24}\]

where the height of the power tower is 24. To determine the last digit of this number, we need to find the last digit of the power tower \(24^{24^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{24}}}}}\) with 24 terms. Since the last digit of 24 is 4, we can simplify the problem to finding the last digit of the power tower \(4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\) with 24 terms.

Next, we need to understand the pattern in the last digits of the powers of 4. Let's compute the first few powers of 4:

\[4^1 = 4 \quad \text{(last digit is 4)}\]

\[4^3 = 64 \quad \text{(last digit is 4)}\]

From this, we can see that the last digits of the powers of 4 repeat every 2 terms: 4, 6, 4, 6, ...

To determine the last digit of \(4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\) with 24 terms, we need to find the parity (odd or even) of the exponent \(4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}\) with 23 terms. Since 4 is even, any power of 4 is also even. Therefore, the exponent \(4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}\) with 23 terms is even.

Since the exponent is even, the last digit of \(4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\) is the same as the last digit of \(4^2\), which is 6.

2. Calculate the number of female students who take the bus for each grade.
3. Calculate 135% of the number of female students who take the bus for each grade.
4. Find the grade for which the number of male students who take the bus is closest to 135% of the number of female students who take the bus.

Let's start with the calculations for each grade.

**9th Grade:**
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(41.1\% \times 600 = 246.6 \approx 247\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(39.4\% \times 600 = 236.4 \approx 236\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(1.35 \times 236 = 318.6 \approx 319\)
- Difference: \(|247 - 319| = 72\)

**10th Grade:**
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(34.4\% \times 600 = 206.4 \approx 206\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(33.1\% \times 600 = 198.6 \approx 199\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(1.35 \times 199 = 268.65 \approx 269\)
- Difference: \(|206 - 269| = 63\)

**11th Grade:**
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(20.6\% \times 600 = 123.6 \approx 124\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(13.8\% \times 600 = 82.8 \approx 83\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(1.35 \times 83 = 112.05 \approx 112\)
- Difference: \(|124 - 112| = 12\)

**12th Grade:**
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(11.6\% \times 600 = 69.6 \approx 70\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(8.6\% \times 600 = 51.6 \approx 52\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(1.35 \times 52 = 70.2 \approx 70\)
- Difference: \(|70 - 70| = 0\)

The grade with the smallest difference is the 12th grade, where the number of male students who take the bus is exactly equal to 135% of the number of female students who take the bus.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To determine the probability that three sides of lengths 1, \( x \), and \( y \) can form a triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, we have the following three inequalities:

1. \( x + y > 1 \)
2. \( x + 1 > y \) or \( x > y - 1 \)
3. \( y + 1 > x \) or \( y > x - 1 \)

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are chosen from the interval \((0, 3)\), we need to find the region in the \( xy \)-plane that satisfies all these inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step.

1. The inequality \( x + y > 1 \) represents the region above the line \( y = 1 - x \).
2. The inequality \( x > y - 1 \) represents the region above the line \( y = x + 1 \).
3. The inequality \( y > x - 1 \) represents the region above the line \( y = x - 1 \).

We also need to consider the constraints \( 0 < x < 3 \) and \( 0 < y < 3 \). The region of interest is the intersection of the regions defined by these inequalities within the square with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((3,0)\), \((3,3)\), and \((0,3)\).

Let's sketch these lines and find the intersection points:
- The line \( y = 1 - x \) intersects the square at \((0,1)\) and \((1,0)\).
- The line \( y = x + 1 \) intersects the square at \((0,1)\) and \((2,3)\).
- The line \( y = x - 1 \) intersects the square at \((1,0)\) and \((3,2)\).

The intersection of these regions forms a quadrilateral with vertices at \((0,1)\), \((1,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,2)\). To find the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the Shoelace Theorem. The Shoelace Theorem states that for vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\) of a polygon, the area is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \right|
\]

Applying the Shoelace Theorem to our vertices \((0,1)\), \((1,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,2)\), we get:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0\cdot0 + 1\cdot3 + 2\cdot2 + 3\cdot1 - (1\cdot1 + 0\cdot2 + 3\cdot3 + 2\cdot0) \right|
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 3 + 4 + 3 - (1 + 0 + 9 + 0) \right|
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 10 - 10 \right|
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 \right|
= 0
\]

This calculation is incorrect because the quadrilateral is actually a kite, and we need to split it into two triangles to find the area. The correct area of the quadrilateral is the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles outside the quadrilateral.

The area of the square is \(3 \times 3 = 9\). The area of the triangle below \( y = 1 - x \) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}\). The area of the triangle above \( y = x + 1 \) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2\). The area of the triangle above \( y = x - 1 \) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2\).

The total area of the two triangles outside the quadrilateral is \(\frac{1}{2} + 2 + 2 = \frac{9}{2}\). Therefore, the area of the quadrilateral is \(9 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}\).

The probability that the three sides can form a triangle is the area of the quadrilateral divided by the area of the square:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{9}{2}}{9} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the probability that the three sides of lengths 1, \( x \), and \( y \) can form a triangle is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

"To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\), we first need to rewrite it in standard quadratic form. We do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the inequality:

\[x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\]
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-14\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(2\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as follows:

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0\]

To determine where the product \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) is less than or equal to zero, we need to find the roots of the equation \((x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\). The roots are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, \infty)\).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the product is non-positive. Let's test the point \(x = -3\) from the interval \((-\infty, -2)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10 > 0\]

So, the product is positive in the interval \((-\infty, -2)\).

Next, let's test the point \(x = 0\) from the interval \((-2, 7)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 < 0\]

So, the product is negative in the interval \((-2, 7)\).

Finally, let's test the point \(x = 8\) from the interval \((7, \infty)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0\]

So, the product is positive in the interval \((7, \infty)\).

We also need to check the values at the roots \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-2 - 7)(-2 + 2) = (-9)(0) = 0\]
\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (7 - 7)(7 + 2) = (0)(9) = 0\]

So, the product is zero at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\).

Therefore, the product \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) is less than or equal to zero in the interval \([-2, 7]\). In interval notation, the solution to the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\) is:

\[19x - 4x.\]

Next, let's group the constant terms together:
\[1 - 81.\]

Now, we can combine the like terms:
\[19x - 4x = (19 - 4)x = 15x,\]
\[1 - 81 = -80.\]

So, when we put it all together, the simplified expression is:

"To determine the number of integer solutions in the solution set of the inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by solving the inequality step by step.

The absolute value inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \) can be rewritten as a compound inequality:
\[
-5.6 \leq x-2 \leq 5.6
\]
Next, we isolate \( x \) by adding 2 to all parts of the inequality:
\[
-5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2
\]
Simplifying the left and right sides, we get:
\[
-3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6

To find the number of these integers, we can count them directly or use the formula for the number of integers in a range. The number of integers from \( a \) to \( b \) inclusive is \( b - a + 1 \). Here, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 7 \), so the number of integers is:

"To find the value of \( f(-2) \) for the function \( f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4 \), we need to substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function and then simplify step by step.

1. Start with the function:

   f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4

2. Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4

3. Calculate \( (-2)^2 \):

   So the expression becomes:

4. Multiply \( 5 \) by \( 4 \):

"To determine the domain of the function \( g(x) = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:

\]

First, we expand both squares:

\[
(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9

\[
(x-8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64

Next, we substitute these expanded forms back into the inequality:

We simplify the left-hand side by combining like terms:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 \geq 0

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to \( f'(x) = 0 \) are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Here, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   So, \( f(-3) = 6 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0

   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Therefore, \( f(2) = 6 \).

From the above, the solutions are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Since \( x \leq 3 \) for the first solution and \( x > 3 \) for the second solution, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5

First, let's rewrite the function in a more convenient form:
\[ z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y. \]

We can expand the squared term:
\[ z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 2y^2 - 3y = 4x^2 - 4xy - y^2 - 3y. \]

Now, we need to consider the optimal strategy for Brahmagupta, who will choose \( y \) after Archemides has chosen \( x \). Brahmagupta wants to maximize \( z \), so we need to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \( z \) for a given \( x \).

To do this, we take the partial derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( y \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -4x - 2y - 3. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ -4x - 2y - 3 = 0 \implies y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}. \]

This is the value of \( y \) that Brahmagupta will choose to maximize \( z \) for a given \( x \). Now, we substitute \( y = -2x - \frac{3}{2} \) back into the original function \( z \):
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 - 4x\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) - \left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 3\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right). \]

Simplify the expression step by step:
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x - \left(4x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}\right) + 6x + \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x - 4x^2 - 6x - \frac{9}{4} + 6x + \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}. \]

Now, Archemides wants to minimize this expression. We take the derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 16x + 6. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ 16x + 6 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{3}{8}. \]

Therefore, the optimal value of \( x \) that Archemides should choose is \(\boxed{-\frac{3}{8}}\).","[-3/8, '-\\frac{3}{8}']",-\frac{3}{8},"[-3/8, '-\\frac{3}{8}']",True

"To determine the area of the gray part in the given figure, we need to analyze the components of the seven pieces of the Chinese tangram and their respective areas.

First, let's identify the area of each piece of the tangram:
1. The tangram consists of one large square, one medium square, two large right triangles, one medium right triangle, and two small right triangles.
2. The total area of the tangram is equal to the area of the original square, which is 16 square inches.

The pieces of the tangram can be described as follows:
- The large square is one of the pieces.
- The medium square is another piece.
- The two large right triangles together form the large square.
- The medium right triangle is one piece.
- The two small right triangles together form a square that is half the area of the medium square.

Now, let's calculate the area of each piece:
- The area of the large square is 16 square inches.
- The area of the medium square is half the area of the large square, so it is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square inches.
- The area of the two large right triangles together is equal to the area of the large square, so it is 16 square inches.
- The area of the medium right triangle is half the area of the medium square, so it is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square inches.
- The area of the two small right triangles together is equal to the area of the medium square, so it is 8 square inches.

The gray part in the figure is one of the small right triangles. Since the two small right triangles together form a square that is half the area of the medium square, the area of one small right triangle is half of that, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square inches.

Therefore, the area of the gray part is \(\boxed{4}\) square inches.","[4, '4']",2,"[2, '2']",False

"To find the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) where \( |z| = 1 \), we start by expressing \( z \) in its polar form. Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is a real number. Then, we have:

\[ |z| = 1 \]
\[ z^2 = e^{2i\theta} \]

We need to evaluate the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \). First, we compute \( |1 + z| \):

\[ |1 + z| = |1 + e^{i\theta}| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{1 + 2\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos\theta} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos\theta)} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = 2\left|\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right| \]

Next, we compute \( |1 - z + z^2| \):

\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{2i\theta}| = \sqrt{(1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta - \sin2\theta)^2} \]
Using the double-angle identities \( \cos2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \) and \( \sin2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \), we get:
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(1 - \cos\theta + 2\cos^2\theta - 1)^2 + (\sin\theta - 2\sin\theta\cos\theta)^2} = \sqrt{(2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta(1 - 2\cos\theta)^2} \]
\[ = \sqrt{\cos^2\theta(2\cos\theta - 1)^2 + \sin^2\theta(2\cos\theta - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(2\cos\theta - 1)^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta)} = \sqrt{(2\cos\theta - 1)^2} = |2\cos\theta - 1| \]

Now, we need to maximize the expression \( 2\left|\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right| + |2\cos\theta - 1| \). Let \( x = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \). Then, \( \cos\theta = 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 1 = 2x^2 - 1 \). The expression becomes:

\[ 2|x| + |2(2x^2 - 1) - 1| = 2|x| + |4x^2 - 3| \]

Since \( x = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \), \( x \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\). We need to consider the function \( f(x) = 2|x| + |4x^2 - 3| \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\).

First, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints \( x = \pm 1 \):

\[ f(1) = 2|1| + |4(1)^2 - 3| = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
\[ f(-1) = 2|-1| + |4(-1)^2 - 3| = 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Next, we find the critical points by considering the behavior of \( f(x) \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\). The expression \( |4x^2 - 3| \) changes at \( x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2\left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right| + \left|4\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - 3\right| = \sqrt{3} + |3 - 3| = \sqrt{3} \]
\[ f\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2\left|-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right| + \left|4\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - 3\right| = \sqrt{3} + |3 - 3| = \sqrt{3} \]

From these evaluations, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is 3. Therefore, the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) is:

"To determine how many digits are common between the seven-digit and eight-digit representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits of each representation:

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Therefore, \( N \) must be one of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.**
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \( 21420N \) is:

**Step 3: Find the common values of \( N \) that satisfy both conditions.**
From the two sets of possible values for \( N \) (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and (0, 3, 6, 9), the common values are 0 and 6. Since we are asked for a non-zero value, we have:

1. Simplify the left side of the equation.
2. Isolate the term involving \(a\).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63.\]

First, calculate \(5^2\):
\[5^2 = 25.\]

So the equation becomes:
\[25 - \frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 63.\]

Next, isolate the term involving \(a\) by subtracting 25 from both sides:
\[-\frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 63 - 25.\]
\[-\frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = 38.\]

Now, multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:
\[\frac{4(5-a)^2}{3} = -38.\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the denominator:
\[4(5-a)^2 = -114.\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[(5-a)^2 = -\frac{114}{4}.\]
\[(5-a)^2 = -28.5.\]

"To find the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we first reduce the bases modulo 11.

\[

\]
So, \(129 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).

Next, we reduce 96 modulo 11:
\[
96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8 \quad \text{(since } 96 = 11 \times 8 + 8\text{)}
\]
So, \(96 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).

Now, we substitute these congruences back into the original expression:
\[
129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 8^{34} + 8^{38} \pmod{11}
\]

We can factor out \(8^{34}\) from the expression:
\[
8^{34} + 8^{38} = 8^{34}(1 + 8^4)
\]

Next, we need to find \(8^4 \pmod{11}\):
\[
8^2 = 64 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}
\]
\[
8^4 = (8^2)^2 \equiv 9^2 = 81 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}

So, we have:
\[
1 + 8^4 \equiv 1 + 4 = 5 \pmod{11}
\]

Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
8^{34}(1 + 8^4) \equiv 8^{34} \cdot 5 \pmod{11}
\]

Now, we need to find \(8^{34} \pmod{11}\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that \(8^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). We can write \(8^{34}\) as:
\[
8^{34} = 8^{30} \cdot 8^4 = (8^{10})^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 8^4 \pmod{11}
\]

We already know that \(8^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}\), so:
\[
8^{34} \equiv 4 \pmod{11}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
8^{34} \cdot 5 \equiv 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \pmod{11}

Finally, we reduce 20 modulo 11:
\[
20 \div 11 = 1 \text{ remainder } 9 \quad \text{(since } 20 = 11 \times 1 + 9\text{)}

"To find the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) that satisfies the equation \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}\) and has the minimum modulus, we start by letting \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2z + 5y \\ -5x - z \\ x - 2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We set this equal to \(\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}\) and obtain the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
2z + 5y = 90, \\
-5x - z = 30, \\
x - 2y = 30.
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the third equation for \(x\):

\[
x = 2y + 30.
\]

Next, substitute \(x = 2y + 30\) into the second equation:

\[
-5(2y + 30) - z = 30 \implies -10y - 150 - z = 30 \implies -10y - z = 180 \implies z = -10y - 180.
\]

Now substitute \(z = -10y - 180\) into the first equation:

\[
2(-10y - 180) + 5y = 90 \implies -20y - 360 + 5y = 90 \implies -15y - 360 = 90 \implies -15y = 450 \implies y = -30.
\]

Now substitute \(y = -30\) back into the expressions for \(x\) and \(z\):

\[
x = 2(-30) + 30 = -60 + 30 = -30,
\]
\[
z = -10(-30) - 180 = 300 - 180 = 120.
\]

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix}\). To confirm that this is the vector with the minimum modulus, note that the general solution to the system can be written as \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for any scalar \(t\), where \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is a vector in the null space of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & -5 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix}\) is orthogonal to \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) and has the minimum modulus among all solutions.

The modulus of \(\mathbf{v}\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\arccos x + \arccos 2x + \arccos 3x = \pi\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arccos x\), \(\beta = \arccos 2x\), and \(\gamma = \arccos 3x\). This gives us the equation \(\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi\). Since \(\gamma = \pi - \alpha - \beta\), we can use the cosine function to express \(\cos \gamma\) in terms of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\):

\[
\cos \gamma = \cos(\pi - \alpha - \beta) = -\cos(\alpha + \beta).
\]

Given that \(\gamma = \arccos 3x\), we have \(\cos \gamma = 3x\). Therefore,

\[
3x = -\cos(\alpha + \beta).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get

\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta.
\]

Since \(\cos \alpha = x\) and \(\cos \beta = 2x\), we need to find \(\sin \alpha\) and \(\sin \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have

\[
\sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = \sqrt{1 - (2x)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}.
\]

Substituting these into the cosine addition formula, we get

\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = x \cdot 2x - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 4x^2} = 2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Thus, the equation \(3x = -\cos(\alpha + \beta)\) becomes

\[
3x = -\left(2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}\right) = -2x^2 + \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get

\[
\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)} = 3x + 2x^2.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2) = (3x + 2x^2)^2.
\]

Expanding both sides, we have

\[
1 - 4x^2 - x^2 + 4x^4 = 9x^2 + 12x^3 + 4x^4,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
1 - 5x^2 + 4x^4 = 9x^2 + 12x^3 + 4x^4.
\]

Subtracting \(4x^4\) from both sides, we get

\[
1 - 5x^2 = 9x^2 + 12x^3.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain the cubic equation

\[
12x^3 + 14x^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

Thus, the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are \(a = 12\), \(b = 14\), \(c = 0\), and \(d = -1\). The sum of the absolute values of these coefficients is

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively:

S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

We know that the sum of these expressions is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We can use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get:

S_1S_2S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 = 4\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = 4(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 4 \cdot 2^2 = 16.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1S_2S_3 = 16\), the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 16 = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 - 16 = 0\).

"To find the largest integer less than \(2010\) that satisfies the given conditions, we need to solve the following system of congruences:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}
\end{cases}
\]

First, observe that the last two congruences can be combined since they both have the same remainder:

\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{\text{lcm}(11, 13)}
\]

The least common multiple of \(11\) and \(13\) is \(143\) (since \(11\) and \(13\) are both prime). Therefore, we have:

\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\]

Now, we need to solve the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\end{cases}
\]

We can express \(x\) in terms of the second congruence:

\[
x = 143k + 10
\]

for some integer \(k\). Substitute this expression into the first congruence:

\[
143k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify \(143 \pmod{7}\):

\[
143 \div 7 = 20 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 143 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the congruence becomes:

\[
3k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

Subtract \(10\) from both sides:

\[
3k \equiv -5 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(-5 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we have:

\[
3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]

To solve for \(k\), we need the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(7\). The inverse \(y\) satisfies:

\[
3y \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

We can test values for \(y\):

\[
3 \cdot 1 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 2 = 6 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 3 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 5 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the inverse of \(3\) modulo \(7\) is \(5\). Multiply both sides of the congruence \(3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) by \(5\):

\[
k \equiv 10 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
k \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Thus, \(k\) can be written as:

k = 7m + 3

Therefore, the largest integer less than \(2010\) that satisfies the given conditions is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationship between \( y \) and \( \sqrt{x} \). Since \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{x} \), we can express this relationship as:

\[ y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}} \]

where \( k \) is a constant. We are given that when \( x = 24 \), \( y = 15 \). We can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 15 = \frac{k}{\sqrt{24}} \]

First, we simplify \( \sqrt{24} \):

\[ \sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = 2\sqrt{6} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 15 = \frac{k}{2\sqrt{6}} \]

To solve for \( k \), we multiply both sides by \( 2\sqrt{6} \):

\[ k = 15 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 30\sqrt{6} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find \( x \) when \( y = 3 \). We substitute \( y = 3 \) and \( k = 30\sqrt{6} \) back into the equation \( y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}} \):

\[ 3 = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{x}} \]

To solve for \( \sqrt{x} \), we multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{x} \) and then divide by 3:

\[ 3\sqrt{x} = 30\sqrt{6} \]
\[ \sqrt{x} = 10\sqrt{6} \]

To find \( x \), we square both sides:

\[ x = (10\sqrt{6})^2 = 10^2 \cdot 6 = 100 \cdot 6 = 600 \]

"To find the value of \(AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2\) where \(F\) is the midpoint of the segment \(\overline{GH}\) and \(G\) and \(H\) are the centroid and orthocenter of triangle \(ABC\) respectively, we can use some known properties of the centroid, orthocenter, and circumcenter of a triangle.

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides the line segment joining the orthocenter \(H\) and the circumcenter \(O\) in the ratio \(2:1\). That is, \(HG = 2GO\).

The midpoint \(F\) of \(\overline{GH}\) is also the midpoint of the segment joining \(H\) and the point \(H'\) such that \(H'\) is the reflection of \(H\) over \(G\). Since \(G\) divides \(HH'\) in the ratio \(1:1\), \(F\) is the midpoint of \(HH'\).

Now, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a triangle is related to the sum of the squares of the sides of the triangle and the distances from the point to the circumcenter. Specifically, for any point \(P\) in the plane of triangle \(ABC\),

\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = \frac{1}{3}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 3PG^2.\]

Since \(F\) is the midpoint of \(GH\), we can use the fact that \(F\) is also the midpoint of the segment joining \(H\) and the point \(H'\) such that \(H'\) is the reflection of \(H\) over \(G\). The distance \(GF\) is half the distance \(GH\), and we know that \(GH = 2\sqrt{4R^2 - \frac{4}{9}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)} = \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{4R^2 - \frac{1}{9}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(F\) is the nine-point center of the triangle, which is the midpoint of the segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter. The nine-point center \(F\) is also the center of the nine-point circle, which has a radius equal to half the circumradius \(R\).

Using the property of the nine-point center, we have:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given that \(a + b + c + d = 1\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-HM (Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean) inequality in a more straightforward way. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, define the function \(f(a, b, c, d) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) and the constraint \(g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 1 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to solve the system of equations given by \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\) and \(g(a, b, c, d) = 0\).

First, compute the gradients:
\[
\nabla f = \left( -\frac{1}{a^2}, -\frac{1}{b^2}, -\frac{4}{c^2}, -\frac{16}{d^2} \right)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (1, 1, 1, 1)
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get:
\[
-\frac{1}{a^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{1}{b^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{4}{c^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{16}{d^2} = \lambda
\]

From these equations, we can express \(\lambda\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\):
\[
\lambda = -\frac{1}{a^2} = -\frac{1}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{c^2} = -\frac{16}{d^2}
\]

Equating the expressions for \(\lambda\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{1}{b^2} \implies a = b
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{4}{c^2} \implies c^2 = 4a^2 \implies c = 2a
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{16}{d^2} \implies d^2 = 16a^2 \implies d = 4a
\]

Now substitute \(b = a\), \(c = 2a\), and \(d = 4a\) into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):
\[
a + a + 2a + 4a = 1 \implies 8a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Then, \(b = \frac{1}{8}\), \(c = 2a = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(d = 4a = \frac{1}{2}\).

Substitute these values back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{4}{\frac{1}{4}} + \frac{16}{\frac{1}{2}} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64

"To find the minimum value of \(a^4 + b^8\) given that \(ab^2 = 5\), we start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\). From the constraint \(ab^2 = 5\), we can solve for \(a\):

Next, we substitute this expression for \(a\) into the expression \(a^4 + b^8\):

\[a^4 + b^8 = \left(\frac{5}{b^2}\right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.\]

Now, let \(x = b^8\). Then the expression becomes:

\[\frac{625}{x} + x.\]

To find the minimum value of this function, we take the derivative with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero. The derivative of \(\frac{625}{x} + x\) is:

\[-\frac{625}{x^2} + 1.\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[-\frac{625}{x^2} + 1 = 0 \implies \frac{625}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 625 \implies x = 25.\]

From this identity, we can express \(\arccos x\) in terms of \(\arcsin x\):

Substituting this into the function \( f(x) \), we get:

Expanding the square, we have:
\[

Let \( y = \arcsin x \). Since \( x \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( y \) ranges from \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) can be rewritten as:

g\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} + 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{4} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{16} = \frac{\pi^2}{8},
\]
\[
g\left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) + 2 \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} = \frac{5\pi^2}{4},
\]
\[
g\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} = \frac{\pi^2}{4}.
\]
Comparing these values, we see that the minimum value of \( g(y) \) is \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\) and the maximum value is \(\frac{5\pi^2}{4}\). Therefore, the value range of \( f(x) \) is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is positive because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.

The expression inside the square root is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \). We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3). \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ (x-2)(x-3) > 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \), which are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:
1. For \( x \in (-\infty, 2) \), choose \( x = 1 \):
   \[ (1-2)(1-3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0. \]
   So, the inequality holds in \( (-\infty, 2) \).

2. For \( x \in (2, 3) \), choose \( x = 2.5 \):
   \[ (2.5-2)(2.5-3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0. \]
   So, the inequality does not hold in \( (2, 3) \).

3. For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \):
   \[ (4-2)(4-3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0. \]
   So, the inequality holds in \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( (x-2)(x-3) > 0 \) is \( (-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \).

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \) is \(\boxed{(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)}\).","[Union(Interval.open(-oo, 2), Interval.open(3, oo)), '(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)']","(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)","[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of dice \( n \) such that the probability of exactly two dice showing a number other than 1 is \(\frac{25}{216}\).

First, let's define the probability of a single die showing a number other than 1. Since a die has 6 faces and 5 of them are not 1, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{not 1}) = \frac{5}{6}
\]
and the probability of a single die showing 1 is:
\[
P(1) = \frac{1}{6}
\]

We are interested in the probability that exactly two out of \( n \) dice show a number other than 1. This is a binomial probability problem where the number of trials is \( n \), the number of successes (showing a number other than 1) is 2, the probability of success on each trial is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability of failure on each trial is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

The binomial probability formula is:
\[
P(\text{exactly } k \text{ successes}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]
where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, \( p \) is the probability of success, and \( k \) is the number of successes. For our problem, \( k = 2 \), \( p = \frac{5}{6} \), and \( 1-p = \frac{1}{6} \). Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{exactly 2 dice show a number other than 1}) = \binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2}
\]

We know that this probability is equal to \(\frac{25}{216}\), so we can write:
\[
\binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2}\) is:
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]
and \(\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}\). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

Next, cancel the common factor of 25 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{216}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{2}{216}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{2}{216}\) to \(\frac{1}{108}\):
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{108}
\]

Multiply both sides by 36:
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{36}{108}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{36}{108}\) to \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, we need to find \( n \) such that this equation holds. Let's test some values of \( n \):

For \( n = 3 \):
\[
3(3-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{3-2} = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 1 \neq \frac{1}{3}
\]

For \( n = 4 \):
\[
4(4-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{4-2} = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve for the value of \(\square\), we start by analyzing the given equations:

1. \(\triangle + \square = \clubsuit\)
2. \(\triangle + \triangle = \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond\)
3. \(\triangle + \triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond\)

First, let's simplify the second equation. It states that two \(\triangle\)s are equal to five \(\diamond\)s. Therefore, we can write:
\[2\triangle = 5\diamond \implies \diamond = \frac{2\triangle}{5}\]

Since \(\diamond\) must be an integer, \(\triangle\) must be a multiple of 5. The only multiple of 5 between 1 and 9 is 5. Therefore, we have:
\[\triangle = 5\]
\[\diamond = \frac{2 \cdot 5}{5} = 2\]

Now, substitute \(\triangle = 5\) and \(\diamond = 2\) into the third equation:
\[5 + 5 = \clubsuit + 2 \implies 10 = \clubsuit + 2 \implies \clubsuit = 8\]

Now, substitute \(\triangle = 5\) and \(\clubsuit = 8\) into the first equation:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume the center \(O\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), and the vertices are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The condition \(AB/AD = k\) gives us the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb.
\]

Next, we need to find the regions inside the rectangle where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center is the line that divides the plane into two regions, one closer to the vertex and the other closer to the center. For example, the perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is the line \(x = 0\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OB\) is the line \(x = 0\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OC\) is the line \(y = 0\), and the perpendicular bisector of \(OD\) is the line \(y = 0\).

These perpendicular bisectors form a smaller rectangle with center \(O\) and side lengths \(a/2\) and \(b/2\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:

"To find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the four points of tangency of the two circles and the parabola, we first need to determine the equations of the common tangents to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) and the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\).

The general equation of a tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) is given by:
\[ y = mx \pm \sqrt{2(1 + m^2)} \]

The general equation of a tangent to the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\) is given by:
\[ y = mx + \frac{2}{m} \]

For the tangents to be common, the constant terms must be equal:
\[ \pm \sqrt{2(1 + m^2)} = \frac{2}{m} \]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ 2(1 + m^2) = \frac{4}{m^2} \]
\[ 2m^2 + 2m^4 = 4 \]
\[ m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0 \]
\[ (m^2 + 2)(m^2 - 1) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions:
\[ m^2 = -2 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]
\[ m^2 = 1 \]
\[ m = \pm 1 \]

So, the slopes of the common tangents are \(m = 1\) and \(m = -1\).

For \(m = 1\), the tangent line is:
\[ y = x + \sqrt{2(1 + 1^2)} = x + 2 \]

For \(m = -1\), the tangent line is:
\[ y = -x + \sqrt{2(1 + (-1)^2)} = -x + 2 \]

Next, we find the points of tangency on the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\).

For the tangent \(y = x + 2\):
\[ (x + 2)^2 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 + 4x + 4 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 0 \]
\[ x = 2 \]
\[ y = 2 + 2 = 4 \]

So, the point of tangency is \((2, 4)\).

For the tangent \(y = -x + 2\):
\[ (-x + 2)^2 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \]
\[ x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 16}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{128}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm 8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6 \pm 4\sqrt{2} \]

Since \(x = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\) is outside the circle, we take \(x = 6 - 4\sqrt{2}\):
\[ y = - (6 - 4\sqrt{2}) + 2 = -4 + 4\sqrt{2} \]

So, the point of tangency is \((6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2})\).

The points of tangency on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) are the reflections of the points on the parabola across the origin:
\[ (-2, -4) \]
\[ (4 - 6\sqrt{2}, 4 - 4\sqrt{2}) \]

The four points of tangency are:
\[ (2, 4), (6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2}), (-2, -4), (4 - 6\sqrt{2}, 4 - 4\sqrt{2}) \]

These points form a quadrilateral. To find the area, we use the Shoelace Theorem. The coordinates in order are:
\[ (2, 4), (6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2}), (-2, -4), (4 - 6\sqrt{2}, 4 - 4\sqrt{2}) \]

The area is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(-4 + 4\sqrt{2}) + (6 - 4\sqrt{2})(-4) + (-2)(4 - 4\sqrt{2}) + (4 - 6\sqrt{2})(4) - \left( 4(6 - 4\sqrt{2}) + (-4 + 4\sqrt{2})(-2) + (-4)(4 - 6\sqrt{2}) + (4 - 4\sqrt{2})(2) \right) \right| \]

Simplifying inside the absolute value:
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| -8 + 8\sqrt{2} - 24 + 16\sqrt{2} - 8 + 8\sqrt{2} + 16 - 24\sqrt{2} - \left( 24 - 16\sqrt{2} + 8 - 8\sqrt{2} - 16 + 24\sqrt{2} + 8 - 8\sqrt{2} \right) \right| \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| -24 + 8\sqrt{2} - \left( 24 \right) \right| \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| -48 + 8\sqrt{2} \right| \]

"To find the modular inverse of \(17\) modulo \(83\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[17x = 83k + 1\]

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). This can be rewritten as:

\[17x - 83k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(17\) and \(83\):

\[83 = 4 \cdot 17 + 15\]
\[17 = 1 \cdot 15 + 2\]
\[15 = 7 \cdot 2 + 1\]
\[2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(17\) and \(83\) are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(17\) and \(83\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 2\]

Substitute \(2\) from the previous equation \(2 = 17 - 1 \cdot 15\):

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot (17 - 1 \cdot 15)\]
\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 17 + 7 \cdot 15\]
\[1 = 15 + 7 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]

Substitute \(15\) from the first equation \(15 = 83 - 4 \cdot 17\):

\[1 = 8 \cdot (83 - 4 \cdot 17) - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 32 \cdot 17 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

Thus, we have:

\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

This equation shows that:

\[-39 \cdot 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

Since \(-39\) is not in the range from \(0\) to \(82\), we convert it to a positive equivalent by adding \(83\):

\[-39 + 83 = 44\]

"To solve the congruence equation \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\), we first need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 14 and 100, and check if it divides 46. The gcd of 14 and 100 is 2, and since 2 divides 46, the congruence has solutions.

We can simplify the congruence by dividing all terms by 2:
\[7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.\]

Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is a number \(x\) such that:
\[7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}.\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. Applying the Euclidean Algorithm to 50 and 7, we get:
\[50 = 7 \cdot 7 + 1,\]
\[1 = 50 - 7 \cdot 7.\]

From this, we see that \(x = -7\) is a solution to the equation \(7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\). Since we want a positive inverse, we take \(x = 43\) (because \(-7 + 50 = 43\)). Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is 43.

Now, we can solve the simplified congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\) by multiplying both sides by 43:
\[u \equiv 23 \cdot 43 \pmod{50}.\]

Calculating the right-hand side, we get:
\[23 \cdot 43 = 989.\]
\[989 \div 50 = 19.78,\]
\[989 - 19 \cdot 50 = 989 - 950 = 39.\]

Thus, the solution to the congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\) is:
\[u \equiv 39 \pmod{50}.\]

This means that the general solution to the original congruence \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\) is:
\[u = 39 + 50k,\]
where \(k\) is an integer. The two smallest positive integer solutions occur when \(k = 0\) and \(k = 1\):

1. Divide 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's perform the division:

The quotient is 9. Now, we need to find the remainder. The remainder is the part of the dividend that is left over after subtracting the product of the quotient and the divisor. We can express this relationship as:

\[54 = 6 \times 9 + \text{remainder}\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many cents are left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie combine their earnings and exchange the total amount for paper money, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by all four individuals.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the number of cents left after exchanging the total amount for paper money.

First, let's find the total amount of money earned by all four individuals:
\[
\text{Linda's earnings} = \$27.47
\]
\[
\text{Sherry's earnings} = \$35.23
\]
\[
\text{June's earnings} = \$37.37
\]
\[
\text{Connie's earnings} = \$26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

When the total amount is exchanged for paper money, the largest paper bill is a \$100 bill, which is equivalent to 10000 cents. Therefore, after exchanging the total amount for paper money, the remaining amount will be the total amount in cents minus the largest multiple of 10000 that is less than or equal to the total amount in cents. In this case, the largest multiple of 10000 that is less than or equal to 12659 is 10000. So, the remaining amount is:
\[
12659 - 10000 = 2659 \text{ cents}

Thus, the number of cents left after exchanging the total amount for paper money is \(\boxed{2659}\).","[2659, '2659']",59,"[59, '59']",True

分母为 \(x^2 - 9\)，我们可以将它因式分解为：

\[
x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)
\]

要使分母为零，我们需要解方程：

\[
(x - 3)(x + 3) = 0
\]

这将导致以下两个方程：

1. \(x - 3 = 0\) 
2. \(x + 3 = 0\)

求解这些方程，我们得到：

- 当 \(x = 3\) 时，分子为 \(3 - 5 = -2\)，不为零。
- 当 \(x = -3\) 时，分子为 \(-3 - 5 = -8\)，也不为零。

"To solve the given equations \(\log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = 2\) and \(\log_y 5x = 2\), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's simplify the first equation using the properties of logarithms. The property \(\log_b a + \log_b c = \log_b (ac)\) allows us to combine the logarithms on the left-hand side:
\[
\log_6 ((x-y)(x+y)) = 2.
\]
This can be rewritten in its exponential form as:
\[
(x-y)(x+y) = 6^2.
\]
Since \(6^2 = 36\), we have:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 36.
\]

Next, let's simplify the second equation. The equation \(\log_y 5x = 2\) can be rewritten in its exponential form as:
\[
y^2 = 5x.
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(x^2 - y^2 = 36\),
2. \(y^2 = 5x\).

We can substitute \(y^2\) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x = 36.
\]
This is a quadratic equation, which we can rewrite as:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0.
\]
To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-36\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-9\) and \(4\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic equation as:
\[
(x-9)(x+4) = 0.
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:
\[
x-9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x+4 = 0,
\]
\[
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4.
\]

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are involved in logarithms in the original equations, \(x\) must be positive. Therefore, we discard \(x = -4\) and keep \(x = 9\).

To verify, we substitute \(x = 9\) back into the equation \(y^2 = 5x\):
\[
y^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45,
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}.
\]
We need to check if these values satisfy the first equation:
\[
\log_6 (9 - 3\sqrt{5}) + \log_6 (9 + 3\sqrt{5}) = \log_6 ((9 - 3\sqrt{5})(9 + 3\sqrt{5})) = \log_6 (81 - 45) = \log_6 36 = 2.
\]
The values satisfy the first equation, so the solution is correct.

"To solve the given equation \(z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0\), we start by recognizing that this equation can be rewritten in terms of a geometric series. Notice that the left-hand side can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} = 0
\]

for \(z \neq -1\). This equation is satisfied if and only if \(z^9 = -1\). The solutions to \(z^9 = -1\) are the 9th roots of \(-1\), which can be written as:

\[
z = e^{i\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{9}\right)} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8
\]

These are the points on the unit circle at angles \(\frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{3\pi}{9}, \frac{5\pi}{9}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \frac{9\pi}{9}, \frac{11\pi}{9}, \frac{13\pi}{9}, \frac{15\pi}{9}, \frac{17\pi}{9}\). However, we must exclude \(z = -1\), which corresponds to \(k = 4\). Therefore, the solutions are:

\[

\[
\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{3} + \frac{17\pi}{9}
\]

First, we convert \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) to have a common denominator of 9:

\[
\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{3\pi}{9}, \quad \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{15\pi}{9}
\]

Now we can add all the fractions:

\[

First, let's find the approximate value of \(\sqrt{20}\). We know that:

Since \(16 < 20 < 25\), it follows that:

"To find the maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) given that \( a + b + c + d = 10 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n},
\]

with equality if and only if \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n \).

We can rewrite \( a + b + c + d \) in a form that allows us to apply the AM-GM inequality effectively. Specifically, we can express it as:

\[
a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} = 10.
\]

Applying the AM-GM inequality to these 10 terms, we get:

\[
\frac{a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4} + \frac{d}{4}}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{a \left( \frac{b}{2} \right) \left( \frac{b}{2} \right) \left( \frac{c}{3} \right) \left( \frac{c}{3} \right) \left( \frac{c}{3} \right) \left( \frac{d}{4} \right) \left( \frac{d}{4} \right) \left( \frac{d}{4} \right) \left( \frac{d}{4} \right)}.
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

\[
\frac{10}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{a \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{c}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{d}{4} \right)^4},
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
1 \geq \sqrt[10]{\frac{a b^2 c^3 d^4}{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4}}.
\]

Raising both sides to the 10th power, we get:

\[
1 \geq \frac{a b^2 c^3 d^4}{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4}.

Therefore,

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 3: Verify the solution by calculating the sums of the other rows, columns, and diagonals
Now that we have \( n = 7 \), let's substitute \( n \) back into the magic square:
\[

#### Sum of the second column:

"To determine how many different possible values the digit \( B \) can take, we need to consider that the number \( B6 \) is a two-digit number where \( B \) is the tens digit and 6 is the units digit. The number \( B6 \) can be expressed as \( 10B + 6 \).

Since \( B6 \) is a positive integer and a perfect square, we need to find all perfect squares that end in 6. Let's list the squares of the first few positive integers and identify the ones that end in 6:

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &= 1 \\
2^2 &= 4 \\
3^2 &= 9 \\
4^2 &= 16 \\
5^2 &= 25 \\
6^2 &= 36 \\
7^2 &= 49 \\
8^2 &= 64 \\
9^2 &= 81 \\
10^2 &= 100 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

From this list, we can see that the only perfect squares that end in 6 are \( 4^2 = 16 \) and \( 6^2 = 36 \). Therefore, the possible values for \( B \) are 1 and 3.

To confirm, let's consider the general form of a number that ends in 6. A number \( n \) that ends in 6 can be written as \( n = 10k + 6 \) for some integer \( k \). If \( n \) is a perfect square, then \( n = m^2 \) for some integer \( m \). We need to check the last digit of \( m \) to see if it can be 4 or 6 (since these are the only digits whose squares end in 6).

\[
\begin{aligned}
4^2 &= 16 \quad \text{(last digit is 6)} \\
6^2 &= 36 \quad \text{(last digit is 6)} \\

\]

we start by rewriting the left-hand side of the equation. Notice that each term can be expressed as a partial fraction. Specifically, we have

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{1/2}{x-1} - \frac{1/2}{x+1},
\]
\[
\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \frac{2}{(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})} = \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{x-\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{x+\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} = \frac{3}{(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})} = \frac{3/2}{x-\sqrt{3}} - \frac{3/2}{x+\sqrt{3}},
\]
\[
\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{4}{(x-2)(x+2)} = \frac{1}{x-2} - \frac{1}{x+2}.

\]

Now, let's denote the left-hand side by \( f(x) \). The equation becomes

\[
f(x) = 2010x - 4.
\]

To find the sum of all complex solutions, we need to consider the polynomial equation obtained by clearing the denominators. The denominators are \( (x-1)(x+1)(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})(x-2)(x+2) \), which is a polynomial of degree 8. Therefore, the equation \( f(x) = 2010x - 4 \) is a polynomial equation of degree 8.

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \). In our case, the polynomial is of degree 8, so the sum of the roots is the sum of the roots of the polynomial obtained after clearing the denominators.

However, we can use a simpler approach by considering the symmetry of the equation. Notice that the left-hand side \( f(x) \) is an even function (since each term \( \frac{k}{x^2 - k} \) is even), and the right-hand side \( 2010x - 4 \) is an odd function. Therefore, if \( x = r \) is a solution, then \( x = -r \) is also a solution. This implies that the sum of all solutions is zero.

A congruence \( ax \equiv b \pmod{p} \) has a solution if and only if \( \gcd(a, p) \) divides \( b \). In this case, \( a = 8 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( p \) is a prime number. Therefore, the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution if and only if \( \gcd(8, p) \) divides 1. Since the only positive divisor of 1 is 1 itself, the congruence has a solution if and only if \( \gcd(8, p) = 1 \).

The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \). Therefore, \( \gcd(8, p) = 1 \) if and only if \( p \neq 2 \). This means that the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has no solution if and only if \( p = 2 \).

Thus, the only prime number \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has no solution is \( p = 2 \). The sum of all such prime numbers is simply 2.

"To determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly chosen positive odd integer less than 2010 is a finite decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which the reciprocal of a number is a finite decimal. A number has a finite decimal representation if and only if its denominator (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Since we are dealing with odd integers, the only prime factor that can be in the denominator is 5. Therefore, the odd integer must be of the form \(5^k\) for some non-negative integer \(k\).

First, we identify all the odd integers less than 2010 that are of the form \(5^k\). These integers are \(5^0 = 1\), \(5^1 = 5\), \(5^2 = 25\), \(5^3 = 125\), \(5^4 = 625\), and \(5^5 = 3125\). However, \(5^5 = 3125\) is greater than 2010, so we exclude it. The valid integers are \(1, 5, 25, 125,\) and \(625\).

There are 5 such integers. Next, we need to determine the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010. The sequence of positive odd integers less than 2010 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 1\) and the common difference \(d = 2\). The \(n\)-th term of this sequence is given by:
\[a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 2n - 1.\]
We need to find the largest \(n\) such that \(2n - 1 < 2010\):
\[2n - 1 < 2010 \implies 2n < 2011 \implies n < 1005.5.\]
Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 1005. Therefore, there are 1005 positive odd integers less than 2010.

The probability that a randomly chosen positive odd integer less than 2010 is of the form \(5^k\) is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[\frac{5}{1005} = \frac{1}{201}.\]
Here, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 201\), and since \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime, the probability is in its simplest form. Therefore, \(a + b = 1 + 201 = 202\).

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15| \) on the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function within this interval. The function \( f(x) \) is composed of absolute value expressions, and the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign are \( x = p \), \( x = 15 \), and \( x = p+15 \). However, since \( x \) is restricted to the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we only need to consider the behavior of \( f(x) \) on this interval.

Let's break down the function \( f(x) \) into different cases based on the value of \( x \) relative to \( p \) and \( 15 \):

1. For \( p \leq x \leq 15 \):
   - The expression \( |x-p| \) simplifies to \( x-p \).
   - The expression \( |x-15| \) simplifies to \( 15-x \).
   - The expression \( |x-p-15| \) simplifies to \( x-p-15 \) because \( x-p-15 \leq 15-p-15 = -p < 0 \).

   Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (-(x-p-15)) = x-p + 15-x - x + p + 15 = 30 - x.
   \]

2. Now, we need to find the minimum value of \( f(x) = 30 - x \) on the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \). Since \( f(x) \) is a linear function with a negative slope, it is decreasing as \( x \) increases. Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) on this interval occurs at the right endpoint \( x = 15 \).

   Substituting \( x = 15 \) into the function, we get:
   \[
   f(15) = 30 - 15 = 15.

4. **Lips**: There are 2 choices (2 different sets of lips).

Since the choice of hair is optional (Tom can be bald), we need to consider the possibility of having no hair as well. Therefore, the number of choices for hair is actually 4 (3 hairstyles + 1 option of no hair).

The formula for the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is given by:

\[
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5

Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then, the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\) is:

(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3

Here, \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(y = \sqrt{3}\). Substituting these values in, we get:

Next, we simplify each term individually:

\[

\[
3(\sqrt{2})^2(\sqrt{3}) = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}

"To determine the area of the set \( S \) of points \((a, b)\) such that the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) has at least one real root, we start by analyzing the polynomial and its properties.

First, note that the polynomial is symmetric, meaning that if \( x \) is a root, then \( \frac{1}{x} \) is also a root. This implies that if \( x \) is a real root, then \( x \neq 0 \) and \( x \neq \pm 1 \) (since \( x = \pm 1 \) would make the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 \) equal to \( 2 + a(1 - x^2) \), which is non-zero for \( x = \pm 1 \) unless \( a = -2 \) or \( a = 2 \), but these values are not in the range \( 0 \le a \le 1 \)).

We can factor the polynomial as follows:
\[ x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = (x^2 + px + 1)(x^2 + qx + 1). \]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[ x^4 + (p+q)x^3 + (pq+2)x^2 + (p+q)x + 1. \]
By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial, we obtain the system of equations:
\[ p + q = a, \]
\[ pq + 2 = -b, \]
\[ p + q = a. \]
From these, we see that \( p + q = a \) and \( pq = -b - 2 \). The discriminant of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + px + 1 = 0 \) must be non-negative for it to have real roots, and similarly for \( x^2 + qx + 1 = 0 \). The discriminant of \( x^2 + px + 1 = 0 \) is:
\[ p^2 - 4 \ge 0, \]
which implies \( p \le -2 \) or \( p \ge 2 \). Similarly, the discriminant of \( x^2 + qx + 1 = 0 \) is:
\[ q^2 - 4 \ge 0, \]
which implies \( q \le -2 \) or \( q \ge 2 \).

However, since \( p + q = a \) and \( 0 \le a \le 1 \), it is impossible for both \( p \) and \( q \) to satisfy \( p \le -2 \) or \( q \le -2 \). Therefore, we must have \( p \ge 2 \) and \( q \ge 2 \), but this is also impossible because \( p + q = a \le 1 \). The only remaining possibility is that one of \( p \) or \( q \) is in the range \([-2, 2]\) and the other is outside this range.

Without loss of generality, assume \( p \in [-2, 2] \) and \( q \ge 2 \). Then \( q = a - p \ge 2 \) implies \( a \ge p + 2 \). Since \( p \in [-2, 2] \), the minimum value of \( p + 2 \) is 0 and the maximum value is 4. However, since \( a \le 1 \), the only valid range for \( a \) is \( 0 \le a \le 1 \). Therefore, \( a = p + 2 \) is not possible, and we must have \( p \in [-2, 2] \) and \( q \le -2 \).

Thus, the set \( S \) is the region in the \( (a, b) \)-plane where \( 0 \le a \le 1 \) and \( b \ge -2 \). The area of this region is:
\[ \text{Area} = 1 \times 2 = 2. \]

However, we need to consider the correct range for \( b \). Since \( pq = -b - 2 \) and \( p \in [-2, 2] \), the maximum value of \( pq \) is 4, so the minimum value of \( b \) is \(-6\). Therefore, the correct range for \( b \) is \( -6 \le b \le 2 \).

The area of the region is:
\[ \text{Area} = 1 \times 8 = 8. \]

Thus, the area of the set \( S \) is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the function is defined and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the constraints on the inner expression \( \log(x-2) \):**
   - The argument of the logarithm must be positive, so \( x-2 > 0 \). This simplifies to \( x > 2 \).

2. **Identify the constraints on the expression inside the outer logarithm \( 2 - \log(x-2) \):**
   - The argument of the outer logarithm must also be positive, so \( 2 - \log(x-2) > 0 \). This simplifies to \( \log(x-2) < 2 \).
   - Since the base of the logarithm is 10, we can rewrite this inequality as \( x-2 < 10^2 \), which simplifies to \( x-2 < 100 \) or \( x < 102 \).

3. **Combine the constraints:**
   - From the first constraint, we have \( x > 2 \).
   - From the second constraint, we have \( x < 102 \).
   - Therefore, the combined constraint is \( 2 < x < 102 \).

4. **Ensure the denominator is not zero:**
   - The denominator of the function is \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \). We need to ensure that \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \neq 0 \).
   - This means that \( 2 - \log(x-2) \neq 1 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( \log(x-2) \neq 1 \).
   - Since the base of the logarithm is 10, we can rewrite this inequality as \( x-2 \neq 10 \), which simplifies to \( x \neq 12 \).

5. **Combine all constraints:**
   - From the combined constraint, we have \( 2 < x < 102 \).
   - From the condition that the denominator is not zero, we have \( x \neq 12 \).
   - Therefore, the domain of the function is \( 2 < x < 12 \) or \( 12 < x < 102 \).

In interval notation, the domain is \( (2, 12) \cup (12, 102) \).

"To find the magnitude \( |w| \) of the complex number \( w = \frac{3z+1}{5z+7} \) where \( z = 1+i \), we will follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( z = 1+i \) into the expression for \( w \).
2. Simplify the expression by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.
3. Calculate the magnitudes of the resulting numerator and denominator.
4. Divide the magnitude of the numerator by the magnitude of the denominator to get \( |w| \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ w = \frac{3(1+i)+1}{5(1+i)+7} = \frac{3+3i+1}{5+5i+7} = \frac{4+3i}{12+5i} \]

Next, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is \( 12-5i \):

\[ w = \frac{(4+3i)(12-5i)}{(12+5i)(12-5i)} \]

The denominator simplifies as follows:

\[ (12+5i)(12-5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169 \]

Now, we expand the numerator:

\[ (4+3i)(12-5i) = 4 \cdot 12 + 4 \cdot (-5i) + 3i \cdot 12 + 3i \cdot (-5i) = 48 - 20i + 36i - 15i^2 \]
\[ = 48 + 16i - 15(-1) = 48 + 16i + 15 = 63 + 16i \]

So, we have:

\[ w = \frac{63 + 16i}{169} = \frac{63}{169} + \frac{16}{169}i \]

The magnitude \( |w| \) of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Therefore, the magnitude of \( w \) is:

\[ |w| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{63}{169} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{16}{169} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{63^2}{169^2} + \frac{16^2}{169^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{63^2 + 16^2}{169^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{63^2 + 16^2}}{169} \]

We calculate \( 63^2 \) and \( 16^2 \):

\[ 63^2 = 3969 \]
\[ 16^2 = 256 \]
\[ 63^2 + 16^2 = 3969 + 256 = 4225 \]

So, we have:

\[ |w| = \frac{\sqrt{4225}}{169} = \frac{65}{169} = \frac{5}{13} \]

Therefore, the magnitude of \( w \) is:

"To find the measure of \(\angle AHB\) in \(\triangle ABC\) where the altitudes \(\overline{AD}\) and \(\overline{BE}\) intersect at the orthocenter \(H\), we can use properties of the orthocenter and the angles in a triangle.

Given:
\[
\angle BAC = 54^\circ
\]
\[
\angle ABC = 52^\circ
\]

First, we find \(\angle ACB\):
\[
\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 54^\circ - 52^\circ = 74^\circ
\]

The orthocenter \(H\) of a triangle has a useful property: the measure of \(\angle AHB\) is related to the measure of \(\angle ACB\) by the formula:
\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - \angle ACB
\]

Substituting the value of \(\angle ACB\):
\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - 74^\circ = 106^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle AHB\) is:
