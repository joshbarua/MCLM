"To convert the Cartesian coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(r\)**:
   The formula for \(r\) in polar coordinates is given by:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   where \(x\) and \(y\) are the Cartesian coordinates. For the point \((0, 3)\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\theta\)**:
   The angle \(\theta\) can be found using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   For the point \((0, 3)\), we have:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
   \]
   Since \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. Therefore, \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

3. **Combine \(r\) and \(\theta\)**:
   Now we can express the polar coordinates as:
   \[
   (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2})
   \]

Finally, we present the answer in the boxed format:

"To find the value of the double sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), we start by rewriting the sum in a more convenient form. Let \(n = j + k\). Then, for each fixed \(n\), \(j\) can take any value from 1 to \(n-1\) and \(k = n - j\). Therefore, the double sum can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

The inner sum \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}\) is simply \((n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\). Thus, the double sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right).
\]

We can split this into two separate sums:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

We know that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.
\]

Thus, the value of the double sum is:

\[
\boxed{p - q}.

"To find the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} \), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -2 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = 0 \) separately, and then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f(-2) \):
\[
f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2
\]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(-1) \):
\[
f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Then, let's evaluate \( f(0) \):
\[
f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1
\]

Now, we sum the values of \( f(-2) \), \( f(-1) \), and \( f(0) \):
\[
f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1
\]

To add these numbers, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2, \(\frac{5}{3}\), and 1 is 3. We convert 2 and 1 to fractions with a denominator of 3:
\[
2 = \frac{6}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 = \frac{3}{3}
\]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \frac{14}{3}

Therefore, the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) is \(\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}\).","[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",\frac{14}{3},"[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",True
"To determine the number of positive integer divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization. We know that:

\[ 196 = 14^2 = (2 \times 7)^2 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \]

The formula to find the number of positive divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\). For the number 196, the exponents are \( e_1 = 2 \) and \( e_2 = 2 \). Therefore, the number of positive divisors is:

\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

We can list all the divisors to verify: \( 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196 \). There are indeed 9 divisors.

"To determine which student has the greatest average speed, we need to analyze the graphs provided for each student. The average speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In the context of the graphs, the distance is represented on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis. The slope of the line connecting the origin to the point representing each student's performance gives us the average speed.

Let's calculate the average speed for each student:

1. **Evelyn**: The point is at (1.25, 4.5). The slope (average speed) is:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{4.5 - 0}{1.25 - 0} = \frac{4.5}{1.25} = 3.6

2. **Briana**: The point is at (2.5, 2.2). The slope (average speed) is:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{2.2 - 0}{2.5 - 0} = \frac{2.2}{2.5} = 0.88

3. **Carla**: The point is at (4.25, 5.2). The slope (average speed) is:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{5.2 - 0}{4.25 - 0} = \frac{5.2}{4.25} \approx 1.2235

4. **Debra**: The point is at (5.6, 2.8). The slope (average speed) is:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{2.8 - 0}{5.6 - 0} = \frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5

5. **Angela**: The point is at (6.8, 1.4). The slope (average speed) is:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{1.4 - 0}{6.8 - 0} = \frac{1.4}{6.8} \approx 0.2059

- Briana: 0.88
- Carla: 1.2235

The greatest average speed is 3.6, which belongs to Evelyn.

"To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon given that one of its equilateral triangles has a perimeter of 21 inches, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three equal sides. If the perimeter is 21 inches, then each side of the triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Side length of the triangle} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ inches}

2. **Relate the side length of the triangle to the side length of the hexagon:**
   In a regular hexagon, each side is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangles that make up the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is also 7 inches.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the hexagon:**
   A regular hexagon has six equal sides. If each side is 7 inches, then the perimeter of the hexagon is:
   \[

"To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers, we start by letting the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these three integers is:
\[
(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect cube. Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 3n \) is a perfect cube. Let \( 3n = k^3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[
n = \frac{k^3}{3}
\]
For \( n \) to be an integer, \( k^3 \) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is a prime number, \( k \) must be divisible by 3. Let \( k = 3m \) for some integer \( m \). Then:
\[
n = \frac{(3m)^3}{3} = \frac{27m^3}{3} = 9m^3

The smallest positive integer \( m \) is 1. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) is:

The three consecutive integers are \( n-1 = 8 \), \( n = 9 \), and \( n+1 = 10 \). The sum of these three integers is:

"To find the angle between the two lines given by the equations \(2x = 3y = -z\) and \(6x = -y = -4z\), we first need to determine the direction vectors of these lines.

### Step 1: Find the direction vector of the first line
The equation \(2x = 3y = -z\) can be written in parametric form. Let \(2x = 3y = -z = t\). Then we have:
\[x = \frac{t}{2}, \quad y = \frac{t}{3}, \quad z = -t.\]
The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d_1} = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)\).

### Step 2: Find the direction vector of the second line
The equation \(6x = -y = -4z\) can also be written in parametric form. Let \(6x = -y = -4z = s\). Then we have:
\[x = \frac{s}{6}, \quad y = -s, \quad z = -\frac{s}{4}.\]
The direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)\).

### Step 3: Compute the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product \(\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)(-1) + (-1)\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = 0.
\]
Since the dot product is zero, the direction vectors are orthogonal, meaning the lines are perpendicular.

### Step 4: Determine the angle between the lines
The angle \(\theta\) between two lines is given by the angle between their direction vectors. Since the dot product is zero, the angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\theta = 90^\circ.

"To determine how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to consider all possible ways to group the terms. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's list the expression without any parentheses:
\[2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1.\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[2 \cdot 3 = 6,\]
\[6 \cdot 4 = 24,\]
\[24 \cdot 5 = 120,\]
\[120 + 1 = 121.\]
So, one value is 121.

Next, let's consider all possible ways to insert parentheses. We will do this systematically.

1. **One pair of parentheses:**

   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126\)

   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 150\)

   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 150\)

"To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 30 and can be written only with the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10. 

First, a number is a multiple of 10 if its last digit is 0. Therefore, the number we are looking for must end in 0.

Next, a number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.

\[ q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x. \]

Since \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), it follows that

\[ q(n) = (n^2 - 1) p(n) - n = (n^2 - 1) \cdot \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} - n = n - n = 0 \]

for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Therefore, \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 6 (because \( p(x) \) is of degree 5 and we multiply by \( x^2 - 1 \)), we can write

\[ q(x) = c(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7) \]

for some constant \( c \).

To find the value of \( c \), we can use the fact that \( q(1) = (1^2 - 1) p(1) - 1 = -1 \). Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the expression for \( q(x) \), we get

\[ q(1) = c(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)(1-5)(1-6)(1-7) = c(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = 720c. \]

Since \( q(1) = -1 \), we have

\[ 720c = -1 \implies c = -\frac{1}{720}. \]

Thus, the polynomial \( q(x) \) is

\[ q(x) = -\frac{1}{720}(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7). \]

Recall that \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x \), so we can solve for \( p(x) \):

\[ (x^2 - 1) p(x) = q(x) + x = -\frac{1}{720}(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7) + x. \]

To find \( p(8) \), we substitute \( x = 8 \) into this equation:

\[ (8^2 - 1) p(8) = -\frac{1}{720}(8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7) + 8 = -\frac{1}{720} \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 8 = -\frac{1}{720} \cdot 720 + 8 = -1 + 8 = 7. \]

Since \( 8^2 - 1 = 63 \), we have

\[ 63 p(8) = 7 \implies p(8) = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.
2. Find the sum of the proper divisors of the result from step 1.

First, let's find the proper divisors of 284. The proper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors of the number except the number itself. We start by finding the divisors of 284.

The number 284 is even, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 284 by 2:
\[ 284 \div 2 = 142 \]
So, 2 and 142 are divisors of 284. Next, we check if 142 is divisible by 2:
\[ 142 \div 2 = 71 \]
So, 2 and 71 are divisors of 142, and therefore 4 and 71 are divisors of 284. Next, we check if 71 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We check for divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 71 (approximately 8.43). 71 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Therefore, 71 is a prime number.

The divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. The proper divisors of 284 are all these divisors except 284 itself:
\[ 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 \]
We now find the sum of these proper divisors:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \]

Next, we find the proper divisors of 220. The number 220 is even, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 220 by 2:
\[ 220 \div 2 = 110 \]
So, 2 and 110 are divisors of 220. Next, we check if 110 is divisible by 2:
\[ 110 \div 2 = 55 \]
So, 2 and 55 are divisors of 110, and therefore 4 and 55 are divisors of 220. Next, we check if 55 is divisible by 5:
\[ 55 \div 5 = 11 \]
So, 5 and 11 are divisors of 55, and therefore 5 and 11 are divisors of 220. Next, we check if 11 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We check for divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 11 (approximately 3.32). 11 is not divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, 11 is a prime number.

The divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220. The proper divisors of 220 are all these divisors except 220 itself:
\[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 \]

"To find the height \( h \) of the cylinder, we start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( V \) is the volume,
- \( r \) is the radius,
- \( h \) is the height.

From the problem, we know:
- The volume \( V = 45\pi \) cm³,
- The radius \( r = 3 \) cm.

We need to solve for the height \( h \). Substituting the known values into the volume formula gives:

\[ 45\pi = \pi (3^2) h \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 45\pi = \pi (9) h \]

We can divide both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 45 = 9h \]

Now, solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{45}{9} = 5 \]

"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2

Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\) into the equation, we get:

To solve for \(DE^2\), we can subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for the function \( y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \) given the graph, we need to analyze the graph and identify the key features of the sine function, such as its amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.

1. **Identify the amplitude \( a \):**
   The amplitude of the sine function is the maximum value of \( y \) minus the minimum value of \( y \) divided by 2. From the graph, the maximum value of \( y \) is 3 and the minimum value of \( y \) is -1. Therefore, the amplitude \( a \) is:
   \[
   a = \frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

2. **Identify the vertical shift \( d \):**
   The vertical shift \( d \) is the average of the maximum and minimum values of \( y \). Therefore, the vertical shift \( d \) is:
   \[
   d = \frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
   \]

3. **Identify the period and the value of \( b \):**
   The period of the sine function is the distance along the x-axis for the function to complete one full cycle. From the graph, the period appears to be \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \). The period of the sine function \( y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \) is given by \( \frac{2\pi}{b} \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2\pi}{b} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \implies b = 3
   \]

4. **Identify the phase shift and the value of \( c \):**
   The phase shift of the sine function is the horizontal shift of the graph from its standard position. The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) has its maximum value at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \). From the graph, the maximum value of \( y \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{\pi}{3} \). Therefore, the phase shift is:
   \[
   -\frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{2\pi}{6} - \frac{3\pi}{6} = -\frac{5\pi}{6}
   \]
   The phase shift is given by \( -\frac{c}{b} \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -\frac{c}{3} = -\frac{5\pi}{6} \implies c = \frac{5\pi}{2}
   \]

However, we need to find the value of \( c \) that is within the range of the given options. Since the problem asks for the value of \( c \) and the graph shows a maximum at \( x = -\frac{\pi}{3} \), we can also consider the equivalent phase shift within the range of \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The equivalent phase shift is:

   c = \pi

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric configuration and use the properties of angles and triangles.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\overline{BC}\) is parallel to the line segment through \(A\).
   - \(AB = BC\).
   - The angle \(\angle BAC = 124^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of the angle \(x\).

2. **Understand the geometric configuration:**
   - Since \(\overline{BC}\) is parallel to the line segment through \(A\), the angle \(\angle BAC\) and the angle formed by the line segment through \(A\) and \(\overline{BC}\) are corresponding angles. Therefore, the angle formed by the line segment through \(A\) and \(\overline{BC}\) is also \(124^\circ\).
   - This means that the angle \(\angle ABC\) is the supplement of \(124^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 124^\circ = 56^\circ\).

3. **Use the property of isosceles triangles:**
   - Since \(AB = BC\), the triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(\angle BAC\) as the vertex angle and \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ACB\) as the base angles.
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

     \[

"To find the minimum value of \(a\) such that all the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) are real, we start by considering the polynomial and its roots. Let the roots be \(r, s, t\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[
r + s + t = -a, \quad rs + rt + st = a, \quad rst = -1.
\]
We need to find the conditions under which these roots are all real. One useful approach is to consider the polynomial in a factored form and analyze its properties.

First, we can rewrite the polynomial as:
\[
x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1).
\]
For the polynomial to have all real roots, the quadratic factor \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1\) must have real roots. The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative:
\[
(a-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \geq 0 \implies (a-1)^2 \geq 4 \implies a-1 \leq -2 \text{ or } a-1 \geq 2 \implies a \leq -1 \text{ or } a \geq 3.
\]
Since \(a\) is a positive real number, we have:
\[
a \geq 3.
\]
To check if \(a = 3\) is indeed the minimum value, we substitute \(a = 3\) into the polynomial:
\[
x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x+1)^3.

The polynomial \((x+1)^3\) has a triple root at \(x = -1\), which means all the roots are real. Therefore, the minimum value of \(a\) is:

"To find the largest integer less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\), we start by considering the expression \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\). Since \(\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}\) is a small positive number, \((\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) is a very small positive number. Therefore, \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\) is slightly less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\).

First, we expand \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:
\[
(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 = \sum_{k=0}^{6} \binom{6}{k} (\sqrt{7})^{6-k} (\sqrt{5})^k
\]
\[
(\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6 = \sum_{k=0}^{6} \binom{6}{k} (\sqrt{7})^{6-k} (-\sqrt{5})^k
\]
Adding these two expressions, the terms with odd \(k\) cancel out, leaving only the terms with even \(k\):
\[
(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6 = 2 \left( \binom{6}{0} (\sqrt{7})^6 + \binom{6}{2} (\sqrt{7})^4 (\sqrt{5})^2 + \binom{6}{4} (\sqrt{7})^2 (\sqrt{5})^4 + \binom{6}{6} (\sqrt{5})^6 \right)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the ratio of Denali's earnings to Nate's earnings remains constant under the given conditions. Let's denote the amount of money Denali earns per conch as \( d \) and the amount of money Nate earns per conch as \( n \).

First, we calculate the initial earnings of Denali and Nate:
- Denali's initial earnings: \( 16d \)
- Nate's initial earnings: \( 12n \)

The initial ratio of Denali's earnings to Nate's earnings is:
\[
\frac{16d}{12n} = \frac{4d}{3n}
\]

Next, we consider the first condition: Denali starts dapping an additional \( 4x \) conch and Nate still daps 12 conch. Denali's new earnings are \( (16 + 4x)d \) and Nate's new earnings are \( 12n \). The new ratio of Denali's earnings to Nate's earnings is:
\[
\frac{(16 + 4x)d}{12n}
\]
Since this ratio must be equal to the initial ratio, we have:
\[
\frac{(16 + 4x)d}{12n} = \frac{4d}{3n}
\]
We can cancel \( d \) and \( n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Next, we simplify the left side:
\[
\frac{4(4 + x)}{12} = \frac{4 + x}{3}
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{4 + x}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
We can cancel the denominators:
\[
4 + x = 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[
x = 0
\]
However, we are given that \( x \neq 0 \), so this condition does not provide a valid solution.

Now, we consider the second condition: \( x \) conch of Nate are given to Denali. Denali's new earnings are \( (16 + x)d \) and Nate's new earnings are \( (12 - x)n \). The new ratio of Denali's earnings to Nate's earnings is:
\[
\frac{(16 + x)d}{(12 - x)n}
\]
Since this ratio must be equal to the initial ratio, we have:
\[
\frac{(16 + x)d}{(12 - x)n} = \frac{4d}{3n}
\]
We can cancel \( d \) and \( n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Next, we cross-multiply:
\[
3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x)
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
48 + 3x = 48 - 4x
\]
Adding \( 4x \) to both sides, we get:
\[
7x = 0
\]
Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get:
\[
7x = 0
\]
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
\[
x = 0

2. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**

   x^2 - 8x + 16 + 2x - 11 = 0

4. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   \[

   So, the potential solutions are:
   \[

     Simplifying inside the square root:

     Since \(\sqrt{9} = 3\):
     \[
     1 = 3 + 4

     \[
     5 = 1 + 4

"To determine the minimum annual interest rate required for the savings account, we need to calculate the future value of the annuity (the series of annual deposits) and set it equal to the desired amount of \$66,200 at the end of the third year.

The formula for the future value of an annuity is:
\[ FV = P \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \]
where:
- \( FV \) is the future value of the annuity,
- \( P \) is the annual payment (deposit),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

In this problem:
- \( FV = 66200 \),

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - 0 \cdot 0 - 1 \implies 2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1.
\]

Next, let's find a general form for \( f(x) \). Set \( y = 1 \) in the functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1 \implies f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2.

This is a recurrence relation. To find a general solution, we can use the method of iteration. Let's compute the first few terms:
\[

\]
\[
f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.

We hypothesize that \( f(n) = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} - 1 \). Let's prove this by induction.

**Base case:** For \( n = 1 \),
\[
f(1) = \frac{1(1+3)}{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1,
\]
which is true.

**Inductive step:** Assume \( f(k) = \frac{k(k+3)}{2} - 1 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to show that \( f(k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+4)}{2} - 1 \). Using the recurrence relation,
\[
f(k+1) = f(k) + k + 2 = \left( \frac{k(k+3)}{2} - 1 \right) + k + 2 = \frac{k^2 + 3k + 2k + 4}{2} - 1 = \frac{(k+1)(k+4)}{2} - 1.

Thus, the formula \( f(n) = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} - 1 \) holds for all integers \( n \).

Now, we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \):

   Similarly, the number of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas sit next to each other is 240, and the number of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas sit next to each other is 240.

   **Step 2.2: Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:**
   Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 5 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 4 people) around a table. Fix one of these blocks to break the rotational symmetry, leaving us with \(4!\) ways to arrange the remaining 4 blocks. Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can switch places, so there are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.
   \[
   4! \times 3! = 24 \times 6 = 144
   \]

   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of arrangements where at least two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is:
   \[
   240 + 240 + 240 - 144 = 576
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:**
   Subtract the number of arrangements where at least two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other from the total number of arrangements.
   \[
   720 - 576 = 144
   \]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 7 people around a circular table such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is \(\boxed{144}\).","[144, '144']",144,"[144, '144']",True
"To determine the profit of the math club, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the pies and then subtract the cost of making them. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the revenue from selling the regular pies:
   The math club sold 54 regular pies, and each set of 3 pies costs $1. Therefore, the number of sets sold is:
   \[
   \frac{54}{3} = 18
   \]
   The revenue from selling these pies is:
   \[
   18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ dollars}

2. Calculate the revenue from selling the cupcakes:
   The math club sold 20 cupcakes, and each cupcake costs $2. Therefore, the revenue from selling these cupcakes is:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}

4. Calculate the total revenue from all the pies:
   Add the revenues from the regular pies, cupcakes, and brownies:

5. Calculate the profit:

"To find the result of a $90^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation of the complex number $7 + 2i$ around the origin, we can use the properties of complex numbers and their representation in the complex plane.

A complex number $z = a + bi$ can be represented as a vector $(a, b)$ in the complex plane. A $90^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation of a vector $(a, b)$ is equivalent to the vector $(-b, a)$. Therefore, the complex number $z = a + bi$ after a $90^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation becomes $-b + ai$.

Given the complex number $z = 7 + 2i$, we identify $a = 7$ and $b = 2$. After a $90^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation, the complex number becomes $-2 + 7i$.

"To determine the number of different teams that can be sent to the Battle of Thermopylae, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 binh lính thượng lưu from 5 binh lính thượng lưu and 8 binh lính hạ lưu from 10 binh lính hạ lưu. This is a combinatorial problem where we use the binomial coefficient, which is denoted as \(\binom{n}{k}\) and represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

The number of ways to choose 4 binh lính thượng lưu from 5 binh lính thượng lưu is given by \(\binom{5}{4}\). The number of ways to choose 8 binh lính hạ lưu from 10 binh lính hạ lưu is given by \(\binom{10}{8}\). Since \(\binom{10}{8} = \binom{10}{2}\), we can use the latter for simplicity.

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) is calculated as:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

First, we calculate \(\binom{5}{4}\):
\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = 5

Next, we calculate \(\binom{10}{2}\):
\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!8!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
\]

To find the total number of different teams that can be sent, we multiply the number of ways to choose the binh lính thượng lưu by the number of ways to choose the binh lính hạ lưu:
\[
\binom{5}{4} \times \binom{10}{8} = 5 \times 45 = 225

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100 x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6}

Putting it all together, we get:

"To solve the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation. Notice that \(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of cubes, which states that \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). Here, \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), so we have:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [(x - 3) + (x - 7)][(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = (2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2].
\]

Since \(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\), we can substitute this in:

\[
(2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2].
\]

Now, we equate this to the right-hand side of the original equation:

\[
2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^3.
\]

We can factor out \(x - 5\) from both sides of the equation:

\[
2(x - 5)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^3.
\]

If \(x - 5 = 0\), then \(x = 5\) is a solution. If \(x \neq 5\), we can divide both sides by \(2(x - 5)\):

\[
(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = 4(x - 5)^2.
\]

Next, we expand each term on the left-hand side:

\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9,
\]
\[
(x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21,
\]
\[
(x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + x^2 - 14x + 49 = 4(x^2 - 10x + 25).
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 10x - 21 + x^2 - 14x + 49 = x^2 - 10x + 37.
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 37 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100.
\]

Rearranging all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 37 - 4x^2 + 40x - 100 = 0,
\]
\[
-3x^2 + 30x - 63 = 0.
\]

We can simplify this by dividing every term by -3:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0.
\]

We factor the quadratic equation:

\[
(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0.
\]

So the solutions are \(x = 3\) and \(x = 7\). Therefore, the solutions to the original equation are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\). We can write the final answer as:

1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6432 and 132.
2. Add 11 to the GCD.

First, let's find the GCD of 6432 and 132. We can use the Euclidean algorithm for this purpose.

The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Step 1: Divide 6432 by 132 and find the remainder.
\[ 6432 \div 132 = 48.738636 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 48.
\[ 6432 - 48 \times 132 = 6432 - 6336 = 96 \]
So, the remainder is 96.

Step 2: Now, take 132 and divide it by the remainder 96.
\[ 132 \div 96 = 1.375 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 1.
\[ 132 - 1 \times 96 = 132 - 96 = 36 \]
So, the remainder is 36.

Step 3: Now, take 96 and divide it by the remainder 36.
\[ 96 \div 36 = 2.6667 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 2.
\[ 96 - 2 \times 36 = 96 - 72 = 24 \]
So, the remainder is 24.

Step 4: Now, take 36 and divide it by the remainder 24.
\[ 36 \div 24 = 1.5 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 1.
\[ 36 - 1 \times 24 = 36 - 24 = 12 \]
So, the remainder is 12.

Step 5: Now, take 24 and divide it by the remainder 12.
\[ 24 \div 12 = 2 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 2.
\[ 24 - 2 \times 12 = 24 - 24 = 0 \]
So, the remainder is 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 6432 and 132 is 12.

Next, we add 11 to the GCD.

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[

From the y-coordinates, we get:

\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, this does not satisfy \(x > 7\). Let's consider the last possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). This satisfies \(x > 7\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8\) and express it in the form \(a < x < b\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the parentheses**: Start by distributing the 2 on the left side of the inequality.
   \[
   -4 < 2x - 2 < 8
   \]

2. **Isolate the term with \(x\)**: Add 2 to all parts of the inequality to get rid of the constant term on the right side.
   \[
   -4 + 2 < 2x - 2 + 2 < 8 + 2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   -2 < 2x < 10

3. **Solve for \(x\)**: Divide all parts of the inequality by 2 to isolate \(x\).

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}\) for \(0 \le x \le 40\) and \(0 \le y \le 50\), we can interpret the expression geometrically.

First, rewrite the expression in terms of distances between points in the coordinate plane:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (0-20)^2} = d((x, y), (0, 20)),
\]
\[
\sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (y-30)^2} = d((x, y), (0, 30)),
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2} = d((x, y), (40, 50)),
\]
where \(d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))\) is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).

Thus, the expression becomes the sum of the distances from the point \((x, y)\) to the points \((0, 20)\), \((0, 30)\), and \((40, 50)\):
\[
d((x, y), (0, 20)) + d((x, y), (0, 30)) + d((x, y), (40, 50)).
\]

To minimize this sum, we need to find the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the total distance to the three given points. This point is known as the Fermat point of the triangle formed by the points \((0, 20)\), \((0, 30)\), and \((40, 50)\).

For a triangle with all angles less than \(120^\circ\), the Fermat point is the point inside the triangle such that the angles formed between the lines connecting the Fermat point to the vertices of the triangle are all \(120^\circ\). However, in this case, the triangle has a right angle at \((0, 30)\), so the Fermat point is simply the vertex of the right angle, which is \((0, 30)\).

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is the sum of the distances from \((0, 30)\) to the points \((0, 20)\), \((0, 30)\), and \((40, 50)\):
\[
d((0, 30), (0, 20)) + d((0, 30), (0, 30)) + d((0, 30), (40, 50)).
\]

Calculate each distance:
\[
d((0, 30), (0, 20)) = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (30-20)^2} = 10,
\]
\[
d((0, 30), (0, 30)) = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (30-30)^2} = 0,

"To determine how far Bill is from his starting point after his walk, we need to analyze his movements step by step.

1. Bill first walks \(\frac{1}{2}\) dặm towards the south.
2. Then, he walks \(\frac{3}{4}\) dặm towards the east.
3. Finally, he walks another \(\frac{1}{2}\) dặm towards the south.

Let's break down his movements in terms of coordinates. Assume the starting point is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

- After the first segment, Bill is at \((0, -\frac{1}{2})\).
- After the second segment, Bill is at \((\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{2})\).
- After the third segment, Bill is at \((\frac{3}{4}, -1)\).

Now, we need to find the straight-line distance from the point \((\frac{3}{4}, -1)\) to the origin \((0, 0)\). The distance \(d\) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by the distance formula:

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula with \(2\cos A\):

\[

"To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all solutions of the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are \( n \)-th roots of unity, we start by solving the equation. Let \( w = z^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \):

\[ w^2 + w + 1 = 0. \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \):

\[ w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

So, the solutions for \( w \) are:

\[ w = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Next, we need to find the corresponding values of \( z \). Since \( w = z^2 \), we have:

\[ z^2 = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad z^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

We recognize that \( \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are complex numbers on the unit circle. Specifically, they can be written in polar form as:

\[ \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{2\pi i / 3} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{-2\pi i / 3}. \]

Taking the square roots of these complex numbers, we get:

\[ z = e^{\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{4\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-4\pi i / 3}. \]

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will cause the function to approach infinity or negative infinity.

The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) to find the roots:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us:
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
\]
\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the left side of the equation:

\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \cdot (x + 37)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 9 = 2x + 74

Now, we need to isolate \(x\). We do this by subtracting \(2x\) from both sides of the equation:

\[
3x - 2x - 9 = 2x - 2x + 74

This simplifies to:

\[
x - 9 = 74

When the person finds an additional bag with 53 dollars, the total amount of money becomes \( 7x + 53 \) dollars. This total amount is then distributed equally among the eight bags, so each bag now contains \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \) dollars.

Since the number of dollars in each bag after the distribution must be an integer, \( 7x + 53 \) must be divisible by 8. Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( x \) such that \( 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \).

First, we simplify \( 7x + 53 \pmod{8} \):
\[ 7x + 53 \equiv 7x + 5 \pmod{8} \]
So, we need to solve:
\[ 7x + 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \]
\[ 7x \equiv -5 \pmod{8} \]
Since \(-5 \equiv 3 \pmod{8}\), we have:
\[ 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \]

To solve for \( x \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8 is a number \( y \) such that:
\[ 7y \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \]
By testing values, we find that \( y = 7 \) works because:
\[ 7 \cdot 7 = 49 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \]
So, the inverse of 7 modulo 8 is 7. Therefore, we multiply both sides of the congruence \( 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \) by 7:
\[ x \equiv 3 \cdot 7 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 21 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form \( x = 8k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \). The smallest positive value for \( x \) is 5. We need to check if this value satisfies the condition that the total amount of money is greater than 200 dollars:
\[ 7x + 53 = 7 \cdot 5 + 53 = 35 + 53 = 88 \]
Since 88 is not greater than 200, \( x = 5 \) is not a valid solution. We try the next value, \( x = 13 \):
\[ 7x + 53 = 7 \cdot 13 + 53 = 91 + 53 = 144 \]
Since 144 is not greater than 200, \( x = 13 \) is not a valid solution. We try the next value, \( x = 21 \):
\[ 7x + 53 = 7 \cdot 21 + 53 = 147 + 53 = 200 \]
Since 200 is not greater than 200, \( x = 21 \) is not a valid solution. We try the next value, \( x = 29 \):
\[ 7x + 53 = 7 \cdot 29 + 53 = 203 + 53 = 256 \]

First, identify the root of the divisor \(x + 1\). The root is \(x = -1\).

Next, write down the coefficients of the dividend \(x^6 - 3\). Since there are no \(x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2,\) or \(x\) terms, we include zeros for these coefficients. The coefficients are \(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3\).

The modulus of a complex number \(a+bi\) is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). For the complex number \(1-i\), we have \(a=1\) and \(b=-1\). So, the modulus is:

"To determine how many students are involved in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( |A| \) be the number of students in MATHCOUNTS.
- Let \( |B| \) be the number of students in the science club.
- Let \( |A \cup B| \) be the number of students in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club or both.
- Let \( |A \cap B| \) be the number of students in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of students in the class is \( |U| = 50 \).
- The number of students in MATHCOUNTS is \( |A| = 28 \).
- The number of students in the science club is \( |B| = 21 \).
- The number of students who do not participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club is 6. Therefore, the number of students who participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club or both is \( |A \cup B| = 50 - 6 = 44 \).

According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club or both is given by:

"To determine the coefficients \( p, q, r \) such that the polynomial \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) is divisible by \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \), we start by finding the roots of the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \). Let the roots be \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Since \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \), it follows that \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are also roots of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \).

This means that:
\[ \alpha^9 + p\alpha^6 + q\alpha^3 + r = 0, \]
\[ \beta^9 + p\beta^6 + q\beta^3 + r = 0, \]
\[ \gamma^9 + p\gamma^6 + q\gamma^3 + r = 0. \]

First, we need to express \( \alpha^9, \beta^9, \gamma^9 \) in terms of \( \alpha^2, \alpha, 1 \) (and similarly for \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)). Since \( \alpha \) is a root of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 \), we have:
\[ \alpha^3 = 3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1. \]

We can use this relation to find higher powers of \( \alpha \):
\[ \alpha^6 = (\alpha^3)^2 = (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)^2 = 9\alpha^4 - 24\alpha^3 + 14\alpha^2 - 8\alpha + 1, \]
\[ \alpha^4 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^3 = \alpha(3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1) = 3\alpha^3 - 4\alpha^2 + \alpha = 3(3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1) - 4\alpha^2 + \alpha = 5\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 3, \]
\[ \alpha^6 = 9(5\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 3) - 24(3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1) + 14\alpha^2 - 8\alpha + 1 = 45\alpha^2 - 99\alpha + 27 - 72\alpha^2 + 96\alpha - 24 + 14\alpha^2 - 8\alpha + 1 = -13\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 4. \]

Next, we find \( \alpha^9 \):
\[ \alpha^9 = \alpha^3 \cdot \alpha^6 = (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)(-13\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 4). \]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[ \alpha^9 = -39\alpha^4 - 33\alpha^3 + 12\alpha^2 + 52\alpha^3 + 44\alpha^2 - 16\alpha - 13\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 4 = -39\alpha^4 + 19\alpha^3 + 43\alpha^2 - 27\alpha + 4, \]
\[ \alpha^9 = -39(5\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 3) + 19(3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1) + 43\alpha^2 - 27\alpha + 4 = -195\alpha^2 + 429\alpha - 117 + 57\alpha^2 - 76\alpha + 19 + 43\alpha^2 - 27\alpha + 4 = -95\alpha^2 + 326\alpha - 94. \]

Now, we substitute \( \alpha^9, \alpha^6, \alpha^3 \) into the equation \( \alpha^9 + p\alpha^6 + q\alpha^3 + r = 0 \):
\[ -95\alpha^2 + 326\alpha - 94 + p(-13\alpha^2 - 11\alpha + 4) + q(3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1) + r = 0, \]
\[ (-95 - 13p + 3q)\alpha^2 + (326 - 11p - 4q)\alpha + (-94 + 4p + q + r) = 0. \]

Since this equation must hold for all roots \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \), the coefficients of \( \alpha^2, \alpha, \) and the constant term must each be zero:
\[ -95 - 13p + 3q = 0, \]
\[ 326 - 11p - 4q = 0, \]
\[ -94 + 4p + q + r = 0. \]

We solve these equations step by step. From the first equation:
\[ 3q = 95 + 13p, \]
\[ q = \frac{95 + 13p}{3}. \]

Substitute \( q \) into the second equation:
\[ 326 - 11p - 4\left(\frac{95 + 13p}{3}\right) = 0, \]
\[ 978 - 33p - 4(95 + 13p) = 0, \]
\[ 978 - 33p - 380 - 52p = 0, \]
\[ 598 - 85p = 0, \]
\[ 85p = 598, \]
\[ p = \frac{598}{85} = 7. \]

Substitute \( p = 7 \) back into the expression for \( q \):
\[ q = \frac{95 + 13(7)}{3} = \frac{95 + 91}{3} = \frac{186}{3} = 62. \]

Finally, substitute \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 62 \) into the third equation:

\[ -94 + 28 + 62 + r = 0, \]

"Given the polynomial equation \(8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\) with three positive distinct roots, let's denote these roots by \(r_1, r_2,\) and \(r_3\).

For the polynomial \(8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\), we have:
- The sum of the roots \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{4a}{8} = -\frac{a}{2}\),
- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = \frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4}\),
- The product of the roots \(r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}\).

\[
\log_2(r_1r_2r_3) = 5 \implies r_1r_2r_3 = 2^5 = 32.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that \(r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients, we start by making a substitution. Let \(y = x^4\). Then the polynomial becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):

\[y^2 + 3y - 4.\]

We can factor this quadratic polynomial as follows:

\[y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1).\]

Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we get:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1).\]

Next, we factor \(x^4 - 1\). Notice that \(x^4 - 1\) is a difference of squares:

\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1).\]

We can further factor \(x^2 - 1\) as another difference of squares:

\[x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1).\]

So, we have:

\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\]

Now, we need to factor \(x^4 + 4\). We can use the identity for the sum of squares, \(a^2 + b^2 = (a + bi)(a - bi)\), but since we are looking for integer coefficients, we use another approach. Notice that:

\[x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]

Thus, the factorization of \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients is:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1).\]

We now need to find the value of \(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1) + p_5(1)\), where \(p_1(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2\), \(p_2(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\), \(p_3(x) = x + 1\), \(p_4(x) = x - 1\), and \(p_5(x) = x^2 + 1\). Evaluating each polynomial at \(x = 1\), we get:

\[p_1(1) = 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 5,\]
\[p_2(1) = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1,\]
\[p_3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2,\]
\[p_4(1) = 1 - 1 = 0,\]
\[p_5(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2.\]

"To find the constant \( d \) in the equation \((\sin x)^7 = a \sin 7x + b \sin 5x + c \sin 3x + d \sin x\), we can use the properties of the sine function and its multiple angles. Specifically, we can use the fact that the right-hand side of the equation is an odd function, and the left-hand side is also an odd function. This means that the coefficients of the sine terms on the right-hand side must match the coefficients of the sine terms on the left-hand side when expanded in terms of \(\sin x\).

First, let's expand \((\sin x)^7\) using the exponential form of the sine function. Recall that \(\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\). Therefore,

\[
(\sin x)^7 = \left( \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \right)^7 = \frac{1}{(2i)^7} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7.
\]

Next, we expand \((e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7\) using the binomial theorem:

\[
(e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{7}{k} (e^{ix})^{7-k} (-e^{-ix})^k = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{7}{k} (-1)^k e^{i(7-2k)x}.
\]

This sum can be written as:

\[
e^{7ix} - 7e^{5ix} + 21e^{3ix} - 35e^{ix} - 35e^{-ix} + 21e^{-3ix} - 7e^{-5ix} + e^{-7ix}.
\]

Combining the terms, we get:

\[
(e^{7ix} + e^{-7ix}) - 7(e^{5ix} + e^{-5ix}) + 21(e^{3ix} + e^{-3ix}) - 35(e^{ix} + e^{-ix}).
\]

Using the fact that \(e^{ix} + e^{-ix} = 2\cos x\), we can rewrite this as:

\[
2\cos 7x - 14\cos 5x + 42\cos 3x - 70\cos x.
\]

Therefore,

\[
(\sin x)^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (2\cos 7x - 14\cos 5x + 42\cos 3x - 70\cos x) = \frac{-1}{64i} (\cos 7x - 7\cos 5x + 21\cos 3x - 35\cos x).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right)\), we can express the cosine terms in terms of sine functions:

\[
\cos 7x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 7x \right), \quad \cos 5x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 5x \right), \quad \cos 3x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3x \right), \quad \cos x = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right).
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the coefficients of the sine terms on the right-hand side must match the coefficients of the sine terms on the left-hand side when expanded in terms of \(\sin x\).

"To find the length of the radius of a sphere given that its volume and surface area are numerically equal, we need to use the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

and the surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ A = 4 \pi r^2 \]

According to the problem, the volume and the surface area are numerically equal. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = 4 \pi r^2 \]

To solve for \( r \), we first eliminate the common factors on both sides of the equation. We can divide both sides by \( 4 \pi \):

\[ \frac{1}{3} r^3 = r^2 \]

Next, we eliminate the \( r^2 \) term by dividing both sides by \( r^2 \) (assuming \( r \neq 0 \)):

"To find the value of \(9 \& 2\), we start by using the definition of the operation \(\&\). The definition states that for any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\),

\[a \& b = \frac{\sqrt{ab + a}}{\sqrt{ab - b}}.\]

Here, we have \(a = 9\) and \(b = 2\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get

First, we calculate the expressions inside the square roots. The numerator is

"To determine the probability that the product of the numbers rolled on two fair six-sided dice is a multiple of 5, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice:**
   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Determine the condition for the product to be a multiple of 5:**
   A product is a multiple of 5 if at least one of the numbers rolled is a multiple of 5. On a six-sided die, the only multiple of 5 is 5 itself. Therefore, the product of the numbers rolled will be a multiple of 5 if at least one of the dice shows a 5.

3. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**
   We will count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 5. It is easier to use the complementary counting method, which involves counting the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5 and then subtracting this from the total number of outcomes.
   
   - If neither die shows a 5, each die has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). Therefore, the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5 is:
     \[
     5 \times 5 = 25

   - The number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 5 is:
     \[
     36 - 25 = 11

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the product of the numbers rolled is a multiple of 5 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

Thus, the probability that the product of the numbers rolled on two fair six-sided dice is a multiple of 5 is \(\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}\).","[11/36, '\\frac{11}{36}']",\frac{11}{36},"[11/36, '\\frac{11}{36}']",True

"To solve the equation \(2^8 = 4^x\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. We know that \(4\) can be written as a power of \(2\), specifically \(4 = 2^2\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right side of the equation as follows:

"To find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72 \), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the left side of the equation.
2. Isolate the term involving \( x \).
3. Solve for \( x \) by expressing both sides of the equation with the same base.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[ 2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72 \]

First, simplify \( 2^3 \):
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ 8 \cdot 3^x = 72 \]

Next, isolate \( 3^x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\). Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as:

\[
\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2)
\]

Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:

\[
kx = (x+2)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[
kx = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]

Rearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation, we have:

\[
x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
\]

For the quadratic equation \(x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0\) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = 4-k\), and \(c = 4\), so the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16
\]

Setting the discriminant equal to zero, we get:

\[
(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0
\]

This can be factored as:

\[
(4-k-4)(4-k+4) = 0
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
k(k-8) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are:

\[
k = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad k = 8
\]

However, we need to check if these values of \(k\) satisfy the original equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\). For \(k = 0\), the left-hand side of the equation becomes \(\log(0)\), which is undefined. Therefore, \(k = 0\) is not a valid solution.

For \(k = 8\), the equation becomes:

\[
\log(8x) = 2\log(x+2)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = (x+2)^2

Expanding and rearranging, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0

Factoring, we have:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 0

So, the only solution is:

\[
x = 2

We need to check if \(x = 2\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \(x = 2\) and \(k = 8\) into the original equation, we get:

\[
\log(8 \cdot 2) = 2\log(2+2)

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\log(16) = 2\log(4)

Since \(\log(16) = \log(4^2) = 2\log(4)\), the equation is satisfied. Therefore, \(k = 8\) is a valid solution.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one tree in terms of the weight of one squig. Let's define the weights of the objects as follows:
- Let the weight of one tree be \( T \).
- Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ten trees weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two trees and one goolee weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We can use the second equation to express \( G \) in terms of \( T \) and \( S \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate terms involving \( T \) on one side:
\[
12T = 4S

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( T \):
\[
3T = S
\]
\[
T = \frac{S}{3}

This tells us that the weight of one tree is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the weight of one squig. To find out how many trees weigh the same as one squig, we take the reciprocal of the weight of one tree in terms of a squig:
\[
\text{Number of trees} = \frac{S}{T} = \frac{S}{\frac{S}{3}} = 3

"To find the maximum possible value of the slope of the line passing through points \( A \) and \( B \), we need to consider the coordinates of these points within their respective squares.

The coordinates of point \( A \) lie within the square with vertices at \( (0,0) \) and \( (2,2) \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( A \) can be written as \( (x_1, y_1) \) where \( 0 \leq x_1 \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq y_1 \leq 2 \).

The coordinates of point \( B \) lie within the square with vertices at \( (4,2) \) and \( (5,3) \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( B \) can be written as \( (x_2, y_2) \) where \( 4 \leq x_2 \leq 5 \) and \( 2 \leq y_2 \leq 3 \).

The slope \( m \) of the line passing through points \( A \) and \( B \) is given by the formula:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}

To maximize the slope, we need to maximize the numerator \( y_2 - y_1 \) and minimize the denominator \( x_2 - x_1 \). The maximum value of \( y_2 - y_1 \) occurs when \( y_2 = 3 \) and \( y_1 = 0 \), giving \( y_2 - y_1 = 3 \). The minimum value of \( x_2 - x_1 \) occurs when \( x_2 = 4 \) and \( x_1 = 2 \), giving \( x_2 - x_1 = 2 \).

Therefore, the maximum possible value of the slope is:

Thus, the maximum possible value of the slope of the line containing points \( A \) and \( B \) is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}\).","[3/2, '\\frac{3}{2}']",\frac{3}{2},"[3/2, '\\frac{3}{2}']",True

\[y^2 + 19 = 10^x.\]

Next, we need to express \(10^x\) in terms of \(y\). However, there is no simple algebraic relationship between \(y\) and \(10^x\) that allows us to directly solve the equation. Instead, we will use numerical methods or graphing to find the solution.

First, let's rewrite the equation as:

\[y^2 - 10^x + 19 = 0.\]

We can use a graphing calculator or software to plot the functions \(y^2 + 19\) and \(10^x\) and find their intersection points. Alternatively, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the function \(f(x) = 3^{2x} + 19 - 10^x\).

Using a graphing calculator, we find that the graphs of \(y = 3^{2x} + 19\) and \(y = 10^x\) intersect at approximately \(x = 2\).

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:

   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2

   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

First, let's denote the radius of the tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the tank by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that water is being poured into the tank at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. This is the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, so we can write:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We also know that when the tank is full, the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This is the rate of change of the height with respect to time, so we can write:

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

2. \( 5x - 1 = -(x + 3) \)

Let's solve each case separately.

**Case 1: \( 5x - 1 = x + 3 \)**

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

Add 1 to both sides:

Divide both sides by 4:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must cover all real values. This means that the range of \(f(x)\) must be \((-\infty, \infty)\).

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\), and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For the function to cover all real values, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).

  \]
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0

  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a \in [2, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\), and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). Since both ranges are \((-\infty, \infty)\), the function covers all real values for any \(a < 0\).

   315 \div 63 = 5 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
   \]
   \[
   315 - 5 \times 63 = 315 - 315 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

The last non-zero remainder is \(63\). Therefore, the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\) is \(63\).

### Step 2: Find the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\)

1. Divide \(1491\) by \(63\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   1491 \div 63 \approx 23.6667 \quad \text{(integer part is 23)}
   \]
   \[
   1491 - 23 \times 63 = 1491 - 1449 = 42
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(42\).

2. Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(63\) and \(42\):
   \[
   63 \div 42 \approx 1.5 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   63 - 1 \times 42 = 63 - 42 = 21
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(21\).

3. Finally, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(42\) and \(21\):
   \[
   42 \div 21 = 2 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
   \]
   \[
   42 - 2 \times 21 = 42 - 42 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

The last non-zero remainder is \(21\). Therefore, the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\) is \(21\).

"To determine the smallest integer value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \) is a real number, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression inside the function is defined and real.

1. **Identify the domain of the function:**
   - The expression inside the square root, \( x-1 \), must be non-negative because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     x - 1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 1
     \]
   - The denominator, \( x-2 \), must not be zero because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     x - 2 \neq 0 \implies x \neq 2
     \]

2. **Combine the conditions:**
   - From the above conditions, we get:
     \[
     x \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 2
     \]
   - This means that \( x \) can be any real number greater than or equal to 1 except 2.

3. **Find the smallest integer value of \( x \):**
   - The smallest integer greater than or equal to 1 is 1.
   - We need to check if \( x = 1 \) satisfies the condition \( x \neq 2 \). Since 1 is not equal to 2, \( x = 1 \) is a valid solution.

Therefore, the smallest integer value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) \) is a real number is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the probability that exactly 4 out of 7 islands have treasure, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of trials (islands),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (islands with treasure),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on an individual trial,
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

In this problem, \( n = 7 \), \( k = 4 \), and \( p = \frac{1}{5} \). First, we calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{7}{4} \):

\[ \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{4! \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate \( p^k \) and \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):

\[ p^4 = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625} \]
\[ (1-p)^{7-4} = \left(1-\frac{1}{5}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125} \]

Now, we substitute these values into the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = 35 \times \frac{1}{625} \times \frac{64}{125} = 35 \times \frac{64}{78125} = \frac{2240}{78125} \]

Therefore, the probability that exactly 4 out of the 7 islands have treasure is:

"To find the value of \( c \) that makes the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To determine the measure of angle \( \angle AFD \), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that the angles \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle CDA \) are each divided into three equal parts. Let's denote the measure of each part of \( \angle BAD \) as \( x \) and the measure of each part of \( \angle CDA \) as \( y \).

From the diagram, we can see that:
\[ \angle BAD = 3x \]
\[ \angle CDA = 3y \]

We are also given the measures of two angles:
\[ \angle ABC = 110^\circ \]
\[ \angle BCD = 100^\circ \]

Since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \), we can write:
\[ \angle BAD + \angle ABC + \angle BCD + \angle CDA = 360^\circ \]

Substituting the known values and expressions for the angles, we get:
\[ 3x + 110^\circ + 100^\circ + 3y = 360^\circ \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3x + 3y + 210^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Subtracting \( 210^\circ \) from both sides, we get:
\[ 3x + 3y = 150^\circ \]

Factoring out the 3, we have:
\[ 3(x + y) = 150^\circ \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x + y = 50^\circ \]

Now, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle AFD \). Angle \( \angle AFD \) is the sum of the two smaller angles formed by the division of \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle CDA \) that are adjacent to \( \angle AFD \). These angles are \( x \) and \( y \). Therefore, we have:
\[ \angle AFD = x + y \]

From the previous calculation, we know that:
\[ x + y = 50^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of angle \( \angle AFD \) is:

"To find the value of \( y \) such that the projection of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ y \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we start by using the formula for the projection of a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\):

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

First, we compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
\]

Next, we compute \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2 \cdot 1 + y \cdot (-2) + (-5) \cdot 1 = 2 - 2y - 5 = -3 - 2y
\]

Using the projection formula, we get:

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We are given that this projection is equal to \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) are the same, we can equate the scalar coefficients:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

To clear the denominators, we multiply both sides by 6:

\[
-3 - 2y = 5
\]

Next, we solve for \( y \):

\[
-2y = 5 + 3

\[
-2y = 8

First, we use the dot product condition:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y + 1 \cdot z = x + y + z = 2.
\]

Next, we use the cross product condition:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot y \\ 1 \cdot x - 1 \cdot z \\ 1 \cdot y - 1 \cdot x \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We are given that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), so we have the system of equations:
\[
z - y = 1, \quad x - z = -2, \quad y - x = 1.

We now have a system of three equations:
1. \(x + y + z = 2\),
2. \(z - y = 1\),
3. \(x - z = -2\),
4. \(y - x = 1\).

We can solve this system step by step. From equation 4, we get:
\[
y = x + 1.
\]

Substitute \(y = x + 1\) into equation 2:
\[
z - (x + 1) = 1 \implies z - x - 1 = 1 \implies z = x + 2.
\]

Now substitute \(y = x + 1\) and \(z = x + 2\) into equation 1:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 2 \implies 3x + 3 = 2 \implies 3x = -1 \implies x = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using \(x = -\frac{1}{3}\), we find \(y\) and \(z\):
\[
y = x + 1 = -\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3},

\[
z = x + 2 = -\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3}.

- \(\angle BFA = 105^\circ\)
- \(\angle ABC = 110^\circ\)
- \(\angle ADC = \alpha\)

First, we need to find the measure of the arc subtended by each angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

1. **Finding the arc subtended by \(\angle BFA\):**
   \(\angle BFA\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(BCDEFA\). Since the hexagon is regular, the total measure of the arc \(BCDEFA\) is \(360^\circ - \text{arc } AB\). The arc \(AB\) is \(60^\circ\) (since it corresponds to one side of the hexagon), so the arc \(BCDEFA\) is \(360^\circ - 60^\circ = 300^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BFA = \frac{300^\circ}{2} = 150^\circ\). However, the given angle is \(105^\circ\), which means there is a mistake in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

2. **Finding the arc subtended by \(\angle ABC\):**
   \(\angle ABC\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(AC\). Since the hexagon is regular, the arc \(AC\) is \(2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \frac{120^\circ}{2} = 60^\circ\). However, the given angle is \(110^\circ\), which means there is a mistake in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

   \(\angle ADC\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(ABCDEF\). Since the hexagon is regular, the arc \(ABCDEF\) is \(5 \times 60^\circ = 300^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ADC = \frac{300^\circ}{2} = 150^\circ\).

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\) and \(y \neq x\). Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\):
\[
f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x \implies \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Let \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda z(1 - z) = x.
\]
Since \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\) into \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\):
\[
z = \lambda \left(\frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) \left(1 - \frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) = \frac{z}{1 - z} \left(\frac{\lambda(1 - z) - z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) = \frac{z(\lambda - \lambda z - z)}{\lambda(1 - z)^2} = \frac{z(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)z)}{\lambda(1 - z)^2}.
\]
Assuming \(z \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(z\):
\[
1 = \frac{\lambda - (\lambda + 1)z}{\lambda(1 - z)^2}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda(1 - z)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda(1 - 2z + z^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda - 2\lambda z + \lambda z^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda z^2 - \lambda z + z = 0 \implies z(\lambda z - \lambda + 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
z = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad z = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.

If \(z = 0\), then \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), but these are fixed points of \(f\), so they do not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

\[
(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72) - (x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46) = 0

Dividing the entire equation by 2, we have:

\[

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 59\):

\[

We solve these quadratic equations for \(x\). The solutions for both equations are the same because the terms involving \(\sqrt{41}\) cancel out when added together. The quadratic equation \(x^2 + 6x - 27 = 0\) can be factored as:

\[
(x + 9)(x - 3) = 0
\]

So, the solutions for \(x\) are \(x_1 = -9\) and \(x_2 = 3\).

Therefore, the points of intersection are \((-9, 10 + \sqrt{41})\), \((-9, 10 - \sqrt{41})\), \((3, 10 + \sqrt{41})\), and \((3, 10 - \sqrt{41})\).

Next, we calculate the distance from each point to the point \((-3, 2)\) using the distance formula \(d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).

For the point \((-9, 10 + \sqrt{41})\):

\[
d = \sqrt{(-9 + 3)^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + (8 + \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64 + 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 + 16\sqrt{41}}
\]

For the point \((-9, 10 - \sqrt{41})\):

\[
d = \sqrt{(-9 + 3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + (8 - \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64 - 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 - 16\sqrt{41}}
\]

For the point \((3, 10 + \sqrt{41})\):

\[
d = \sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (8 + \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64 + 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 + 16\sqrt{41}}
\]

For the point \((3, 10 - \sqrt{41})\):

\[
d = \sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (8 - \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64 - 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 - 16\sqrt{41}}
\]

The total distance is:

\[
2\sqrt{141 + 16\sqrt{41}} + 2\sqrt{141 - 16\sqrt{41}}
\]

Using the identity \(\sqrt{a + b} + \sqrt{a - b} = \sqrt{2a + 2\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}\), we get:

\[

1. Identify the number of students in each quadrant in the year 2005.
2. Arrange these numbers in ascending order.
3. Determine the median of the ordered list.

First, let's list the number of students in each quadrant in the year 2005:

Since there are 8 numbers in the list, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers in the ordered list. The 4th number is 29 and the 5th number is 29. Therefore, the median is:

"To determine the value of \( y \) at which the graph of the function \( y = \frac{4x^3 + 2x - 4}{3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1} \) has a horizontal asymptote, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.

"To determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than 0, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30.
2. Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than 0.
3. Find the intersection of these two sets.
4. Count the number of elements in the intersection.

**Step 1: Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30.**

The prime numbers less than 30 are:
\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\]

**Step 2: Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than 0.**

The set of all odd numbers greater than 0 is:
\[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, \ldots\]

**Step 3: Find the intersection of these two sets.**

The intersection of the set of prime numbers less than 30 and the set of odd numbers greater than 0 is the set of all prime numbers less than 30 that are also odd. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, we exclude the only even prime number, which is 2. Therefore, the intersection is:

**Step 4: Count the number of elements in the intersection.**

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the equation of the ellipse and its properties. The given equation of the ellipse is \(kx^2 + y^2 = 1\), where \(k > 1\). This can be rewritten in the standard form of an ellipse as:

\[
\frac{x^2}{\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1
\]

From this, we can see that the semi-major axis \(a\) is \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{k}}\) and the semi-minor axis \(b\) is \(1\). The distance of each focus from the center is given by \(c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - k}{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k - 1}}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k - 1}}{k}\). Therefore, the coordinates of the foci \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are \(\left(-\frac{\sqrt{k - 1}}{k}, 0\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{k - 1}}{k}, 0\right)\), respectively.

Next, we consider the circle that passes through the foci \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) and is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. The center of this circle must lie on the y-axis due to symmetry, and its radius is the distance from the center to either focus. Let the center of the circle be \((0, h)\). The radius of the circle is then \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{k - 1}}{k}\right)^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{\frac{k - 1}{k^2} + h^2}\).

Since the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of these points of tangency must be equal to the radius of the circle. The points of tangency on the x-axis are \((\pm a, 0) = \left(\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}, 0\right)\). Therefore, the radius of the circle is also equal to the y-coordinate of the points of tangency, which is \(h\).

Equating the two expressions for the radius, we get:

\[
h = \sqrt{\frac{k - 1}{k^2} + h^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:

\[
h^2 = \frac{k - 1}{k^2} + h^2
\]

Subtracting \(h^2\) from both sides, we get:

\[
0 = \frac{k - 1}{k^2}
\]

This equation implies that \(k - 1 = 0\), or \(k = 1\). However, we are given that \(k > 1\), so there must be another way to solve this problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct geometric properties and constraints.

The correct approach is to use the fact that the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, and the distance between the foci is \(2c = \frac{2\sqrt{k - 1}}{k}\). The radius of the circle is also the distance from the center to the x-axis, which is the y-coordinate of the points of tangency. The correct value of \(k\) that satisfies all these conditions is:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

"Given the sequence \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\) of positive integers that is strictly increasing and has the properties that for every positive integer \(k\), the subsequence \(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\) is a geometric sequence and the subsequence \(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\) is an arithmetic sequence, we need to find \(a_1\) given that \(a_{13} = 2016\).

First, let's express the terms of the sequence in terms of \(a_1\) and the common ratios and differences. Since \(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\) is a geometric sequence, we have:
\[a_{2k}^2 = a_{2k-1} a_{2k+1}.\]
And since \(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\) is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}.\]

Let's start with the initial terms. Let \(a_1 = a\), \(a_2 = b\), and \(a_3 = c\). Since \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) is a geometric sequence, we have:
\[b^2 = ac.\]
And since \(a_2, a_3, a_4\) is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[2c = b + a_4 \implies a_4 = 2c - b.\]

Next, since \(a_3, a_4, a_5\) is a geometric sequence, we have:
\[a_4^2 = a_3 a_5 \implies (2c - b)^2 = c a_5 \implies a_5 = \frac{(2c - b)^2}{c}.\]
And since \(a_4, a_5, a_6\) is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[2a_5 = a_4 + a_6 \implies 2 \cdot \frac{(2c - b)^2}{c} = (2c - b) + a_6 \implies a_6 = \frac{4(2c - b)^2}{c} - (2c - b).\]

We can continue this process to find a pattern. However, a more efficient approach is to use the fact that the sequence can be expressed in terms of \(a_1\) and a common ratio. Let's assume \(a_1 = a\), \(a_2 = ar\), and \(a_3 = ar^2\). Then:
\[a_4 = 2ar^2 - ar = ar(2r - 1),\]
\[a_5 = \frac{(2ar^2 - ar)^2}{ar^2} = a(2r - 1)^2,\]
\[a_6 = 2a(2r - 1)^2 - ar(2r - 1) = ar(2r - 1)(2(2r - 1) - 1) = ar(2r - 1)(4r - 3).\]

We can see that the terms of the sequence can be written in a form that involves powers of \(r\) and \(a\). To find \(a_{13}\), we need to determine the pattern for the 13th term. By examining the pattern, we can see that:
\[a_{13} = a \cdot r^6 \cdot (2r - 1)^6.\]

Given that \(a_{13} = 2016\), we need to find \(a\) and \(r\) such that:
\[a \cdot r^6 \cdot (2r - 1)^6 = 2016.\]

For the male students:
\[

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3})}{1} = (1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3})

\[
(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-\sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{2} \cdot 2 + \sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses: \(26^2 - 24^2 - 10\).

We know that \(26^2 = 676\) and \(24^2 = 576\). Therefore,

Next, we need to subtract \(10^2\) from this result. We know that \(10^2 = 100\), so:

Therefore, the value of \((26^2 - 24^2 - 10)^2 - 10^2\) is \(\boxed{8000}\).","[8000, '8000']",8000,"[8000, '8000']",True

\]

for all real values of \(x\) except \(-8\) and \(3\), we start by factoring the denominator on the right-hand side. Notice that

\[
x^2 + 5x - 24 = (x-3)(x+8).
\]

Thus, the equation becomes

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.

To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we need a common denominator, which is \((x-3)(x+8)\). Therefore, we rewrite the left-hand side as

\[

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:

\[
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23.

Expanding the left-hand side, we get

Combining like terms, we have

\[

   (\sqrt{3x-5})^2 = 2^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x - 5 = 4
   \]

3. Next, isolate the term with \(x\) by adding 5 to both sides:
   \[
   3x - 5 + 5 = 4 + 5
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3x = 9

4. Finally, solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{3}

   \[
   x = 3

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(x = 3\) back into the original equation and check if it holds true:
\[
\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{9 - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

"To find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) of integers such that \(|a + bi| \le 5\), we start by recalling the definition of the magnitude of a complex number. The magnitude of a complex number \(a + bi\) is given by:

\[
|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

We need to find all integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \le 5
\]

Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get:

\[
a^2 + b^2 \le 25
\]

This inequality describes a disk in the coordinate plane with center \((0, 0)\) and radius 5. We need to count all the integer points \((a, b)\) that lie within or on the boundary of this disk.

First, we consider the possible values for \(a\). Since \(a^2 \le 25\), \(a\) can range from \(-5\) to \(5\). For each value of \(a\), we determine the corresponding range of \(b\).

1. If \(a = 5\) or \(a = -5\), then \(b^2 \le 0\), so \(b = 0\). This gives us the pairs \((5, 0)\) and \((-5, 0)\).
2. If \(a = 4\) or \(a = -4\), then \(b^2 \le 9\), so \(b\) can be \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us the pairs \((4, -3), (4, -2), (4, -1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)\) and \((-4, -3), (-4, -2), (-4, -1), (-4, 0), (-4, 1), (-4, 2), (-4, 3)\).
3. If \(a = 3\) or \(a = -3\), then \(b^2 \le 16\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us the pairs \((3, -4), (3, -3), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)\) and \((-3, -4), (-3, -3), (-3, -2), (-3, -1), (-3, 0), (-3, 1), (-3, 2), (-3, 3), (-3, 4)\).
4. If \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\), then \(b^2 \le 21\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us the pairs \((2, -4), (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)\) and \((-2, -4), (-2, -3), (-2, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-2, 2), (-2, 3), (-2, 4)\).
5. If \(a = 1\) or \(a = -1\), then \(b^2 \le 24\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us the pairs \((1, -4), (1, -3), (1, -2), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)\) and \((-1, -4), (-1, -3), (-1, -2), (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (-1, 3), (-1, 4)\).
6. If \(a = 0\), then \(b^2 \le 25\), so \(b\) can be \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\). This gives us the pairs \((0, -5), (0, -4), (0, -3), (0, -2), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)\).

Now, we count the number of pairs for each value of \(a\):

- For \(a = 5\) or \(a = -5\), there are \(2\) pairs.
- For \(a = 4\) or \(a = -4\), there are \(14\) pairs.
- For \(a = 3\) or \(a = -3\), there are \(18\) pairs.
- For \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\), there are \(18\) pairs.
- For \(a = 1\) or \(a = -1\), there are \(18\) pairs.
- For \(a = 0\), there are \(11\) pairs.

Adding these together, we get:

\[
2 + 14 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 11 = 81

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses, we need to consider how the placement of parentheses affects the value of the expression. The key is to maximize the negative impact of the subtraction by grouping the largest possible positive terms together and subtracting them from the smallest possible positive terms.

Let's start with the original expression:
\[1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\]

First, we calculate the sum of all the positive terms:
\[1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17\]

Next, we identify the single negative term, which is \(-4\). To minimize the overall value of the expression, we should subtract the largest possible sum of positive terms from the smallest possible positive term. The smallest positive term in the expression is \(1\), but since we can't use it as a negative term, we should consider the next smallest positive term, which is \(2\).

However, the most effective way to minimize the expression is to subtract the sum of all positive terms from the single negative term. Therefore, we should group all the positive terms together and subtract them from \(-4\):
\[-(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6) - 4 = -17 - 4 = -21\]

"To determine whether the function \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is odd, even, or neither, we need to analyze the behavior of the function when the input is replaced by its negative. Specifically, we need to evaluate \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \) and compare it to \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).

Given that \( f(x) \) is an odd function, we have \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) \) is an even function, we have \( g(-x) = g(x) \).

Let's start by evaluating \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \):

1. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).
2. Therefore, \( f(g(f(g(f(-x)))) = f(g(f(g(-f(x)))) \).
3. Since \( g \) is even, \( g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)) \).
4. Therefore, \( f(g(f(g(f(-x)))) = f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \).
5. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(g(f(g(f(x)))) = -f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \).
6. Therefore, \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) = f(-f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).
7. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(-f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) = -f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).

Thus, we have:
\[ f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) = -f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \]

This shows that the function \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) satisfies the condition for being an odd function. Therefore, the function \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is odd.

"To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5\), we need to combine the fractions on the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x}{3}\). The least common denominator of 2 and 3 is 6.

We can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{x \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{3x}{6}
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = \frac{x \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{2x}{6}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{3x + 2x}{6} = \frac{5x}{6}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{5x}{6} = 5

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[
6 \cdot \frac{5x}{6} = 6 \cdot 5

\[
5x = 30

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 5:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of inverse proportionality. According to Daniel, the number of customers who buy a TV is inversely proportional to the price of the TV. This means that the product of the number of customers and the price of the TV is a constant.

First, we need to find this constant. We know that 15 customers buy a TV that costs $1500. Therefore, the constant can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Constant} = 15 \times 1500 = 22500
\]

Next, we need to find out how many customers will buy a TV that costs $2500. Let's denote the number of customers by \( x \). Since the product of the number of customers and the price of the TV is constant, we can write:
\[
x \times 2500 = 22500
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2500:

x = \frac{22500}{2500} = 9

"To determine the area of quadrilateral \(DBEF\), we start by identifying the coordinates of points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).

Given:
- \(A(0, 6)\)
- \(B(0, 0)\)
- \(C(8, 0)\)

Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\):
\[ D = \left( \frac{0+0}{2}, \frac{6+0}{2} \right) = (0, 3) \]

Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\):
\[ E = \left( \frac{0+8}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2} \right) = (4, 0) \]

To find \(F\), we need to determine the intersection of line segments \(AE\) and \(CD\). The equation of line \(AE\) passing through \(A(0, 6)\) and \(E(4, 0)\) is:
\[ y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 \]

The equation of line \(CD\) passing through \(C(8, 0)\) and \(D(0, 3)\) is:
\[ y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]

Setting the equations equal to find the intersection \(F\):
\[ -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]
\[ 6 - 3 = \left( -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{8} \right)x \]
\[ 3 = \left( -\frac{12}{8} + \frac{3}{8} \right)x \]
\[ 3 = -\frac{9}{8}x \]
\[ x = -\frac{3 \cdot 8}{9} = -\frac{24}{9} = -\frac{8}{3} \]

Substituting \(x = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation of line \(AE\):
\[ y = -\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) + 6 = -4 + 6 = 2 \]

Thus, the coordinates of \(F\) are:

"To solve the equation \( |x+5| - |3x-6| = 0 \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that satisfy this equation. This can be done by considering the different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. The critical points are \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 2 \). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

**Case 1: \( x < -5 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 < 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
-(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0 \implies -x-5 + 3x-6 = 0 \implies 2x - 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
However, \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) does not satisfy \( x < -5 \). So, there are no solutions in this interval.

**Case 2: \( -5 \le x < 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0 \implies x+5 + 3x-6 = 0 \implies 4x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) satisfies \( -5 \le x < 2 \), it is a solution.

**Case 3: \( x \ge 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 \ge 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

(x+5) - (3x-6) = 0 \implies x+5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \implies -2x + 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}

The solutions to the equation are \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = \frac{11}{2} \). The value of \( x \) that is the greatest is \( \frac{11}{2} \).

Notice that the numerator and the denominator are real numbers, and the imaginary part of the numerator is zero. Therefore, \( z_3 \) is a real number.

Now, let's compute \( F(z_3) \):
\[
z_4 = F(z_3) = F(z_3) = \frac{z_3 + i}{z_3 - i}.

Since \( z_3 \) is real, \( z_4 \) is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part.

60 = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times CD \implies CD = \frac{120}{17}

Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ACD\) to find \(AD\):
\[
AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 \implies 8^2 = AD^2 + \left(\frac{120}{17}\right)^2 \implies 64 = AD^2 + \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = 64 - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{18496}{289} - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{4096}{289} \implies AD = \frac{64}{17}

"To find the integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \le n < 18 \) and \( n \equiv -11213141 \pmod{18} \), we need to determine the remainder when \(-11213141\) is divided by 18. This can be done by first finding the remainder when 11213141 is divided by 18 and then using the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, we perform the division of 11213141 by 18:
\[ 11213141 \div 18 = 622952.2777\ldots \]
The integer part of the quotient is 622952. Now, we multiply 18 by 622952 to find the product:
\[ 18 \times 622952 = 11213136 \]
Next, we subtract this product from 11213141 to find the remainder:
\[ 11213141 - 11213136 = 5 \]
So, we have:
\[ 11213141 \equiv 5 \pmod{18} \]
This means:
\[ -11213141 \equiv -5 \pmod{18} \]
Since \(-5\) is not in the range \(0 \le n < 18\), we need to find an equivalent positive remainder. We do this by adding 18 to \(-5\):
\[ -5 + 18 = 13 \]
Therefore, we have:

"To find the value of \( f(3) \) given that \( f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5 \) and \( f(-3) = 2 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = -3 \) into the function \( f(x) \) and use the given value \( f(-3) = 2 \).
2. Simplify the expression to find a relationship between \( a \) and \( b \).
3. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function \( f(x) \) and use the relationship found in step 2 to find \( f(3) \).

Let's start with step 1. Substitute \( x = -3 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(-3) = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 2
\]

We know that \( f(-3) = 2 \), so we can set up the equation:

\[
81a - 9b + 2 = 2
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
81a - 9b = 0
\]

Factor out the common term 9:

\[
9(9a - b) = 0
\]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[
9a - b = 0

So, we have the relationship:

\[
b = 9a

Now, let's move to step 3. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(3) = a(3)^4 - b(3)^2 + 3 + 5
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9b + 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 8
\]

We know from the relationship \( b = 9a \) that we can substitute \( 9a \) for \( b \):

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9(9a) + 8 = 81a - 81a + 8 = 8

"To determine how many numbers Rick and Steve could be thinking of, we need to find the common positive divisors of 14 and 42. Let's start by listing the divisors of each number.

First, we list the divisors of 14:
\[14 = 1 \times 14 = 2 \times 7\]
So, the divisors of 14 are \(1, 2, 7, 14\).

Next, we list the divisors of 42:

"To find the equation of the hyperbola given the foci \(F_1 = (10, 2)\) and \(F_2 = (-16, 2)\) and the condition \(|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\), we start by recalling the definition of a hyperbola. The set of all points \(P\) such that the absolute difference of the distances from \(P\) to the two foci is a constant is a hyperbola.

The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis is:
\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the hyperbola, \(2a\) is the distance between the vertices, and the distance between the foci is \(2c\). The relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\).

First, we find the center \((h, k)\) of the hyperbola. The center is the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci:
\[
h = \frac{10 + (-16)}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad k = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
So, the center is \((-3, 2)\).

Next, we identify \(a\) and \(c\). The distance between the foci is \(2c\):
\[
2c = \sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{26^2} = 26 \implies c = 13
\]
The constant difference \(|PF_1 - PF_2|\) is \(2a\):
\[
2a = 24 \implies a = 12
\]
Now, we can find \(b\) using the relationship \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\):
\[
13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5

Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:

\]
Finally, we need to find \(h + k + a + b\):
\[
h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   This means there is 1 multiple of 25 (25).

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   There are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no such multiples in the range from 1 to 42, we stop here.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:

"To find the quotient of \(413_5 \div 2_5\) in base 5, we first need to convert the base 5 numbers to base 10, perform the division in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 5.

### Step 1: Convert \(413_5\) to base 10
The base 5 number \(413_5\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0
\]
Calculating each term, we get:
\[
4 \cdot 25 = 100, \quad 1 \cdot 5 = 5, \quad 3 \cdot 1 = 3
\]
Adding these values together, we get:
\[
100 + 5 + 3 = 108
\]
So, \(413_5\) in base 10 is \(108\).

### Step 2: Convert \(2_5\) to base 10
The base 5 number \(2_5\) is already a base 10 number, so it remains \(2\).

### Step 3: Perform the division in base 10
Now, we divide \(108\) by \(2\):
\[
108 \div 2 = 54
\]
So, the quotient in base 10 is \(54\).

### Step 4: Convert \(54\) back to base 5
To convert \(54\) from base 10 to base 5, we repeatedly divide by 5 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
54 \div 5 = 10 \text{ remainder } 4

\[
10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ remainder } 0
\]
\[
2 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 2

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Consequently, \(d\) must also divide any linear combination of \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\). Specifically, we can consider the expression \(2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 2n + 14 - 2n - 1 = 13\). Therefore, \(d\) must divide 13.

Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values for \(d\) are 1 and 13. To determine if \(d\) can actually be 13, we need to find an integer \(n\) such that both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\) are divisible by 13. Let's assume \(n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}\).

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to each term in a strategic way. Consider the terms \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), and \(2y^2\). By AM-GM, we have:
\[x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2} = 3 \sqrt[3]{4x^4 y^4}.\]

However, this approach does not directly help us find the minimum value. Instead, let's try another approach by considering the symmetry and the constraint \(xyz = 2\).

Let's test if the minimum occurs when \(x = z\). If \(x = z\), then the constraint becomes \(xyx = 2\) or \(x^2 y = 2\), so \(y = \frac{2}{x^2}\). Substituting \(y = \frac{2}{x^2}\) and \(z = x\) into the expression, we get:
\[x^4 + 4 \left(\frac{2}{x^2}\right)^2 + 4x^4 = x^4 + 4 \cdot \frac{4}{x^4} + 4x^4 = 5x^4 + \frac{16}{x^4}.\]

Now, let \(u = x^4\). Then the expression becomes:
\[5u + \frac{16}{u}.\]

To find the minimum value of this function, we take the derivative with respect to \(u\) and set it to zero:
\[\frac{d}{du} \left(5u + \frac{16}{u}\right) = 5 - \frac{16}{u^2}.\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[5 - \frac{16}{u^2} = 0 \implies 5u^2 = 16 \implies u^2 = \frac{16}{5} \implies u = \frac{4}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{5}.\]

Substituting \(u = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{5}\) back into the expression, we get:
\[5 \left(\frac{4\sqrt{5}}{5}\right) + \frac{16}{\frac{4\sqrt{5}}{5}} = 4\sqrt{5} + \frac{16 \cdot 5}{4\sqrt{5}} = 4\sqrt{5} + \frac{20}{\sqrt{5}} = 4\sqrt{5} + 4\sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{5}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) is \(\boxed{8\sqrt{5}}\).","[8*sqrt(5), '8\\sqrt{5}']",16,"[16, '16']",False
"To solve the equation \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{x-5}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the denominators** by cross-multiplying. This means we multiply the numerator of the left fraction by the denominator of the right fraction and set it equal to the product of the numerator of the right fraction and the denominator of the left fraction.
   \[
   2 \cdot (x-5) = 4 \cdot 3

2. **Simplify both sides** of the equation. On the left side, distribute the 2, and on the right side, multiply 4 by 3.
   \[

3. **Isolate the term with \(x\)** by adding 10 to both sides of the equation.

   \[
   x = 11

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = 11\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{11-5}

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}

"To determine Rosa's age, we need to find a number that satisfies the following conditions:
1. When divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1.
2. When divided by 7, the remainder is 0.
3. The number is less than 75.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6. The LCM of these numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by each of them. We can find the LCM by determining the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorization of these numbers:
- The prime factorization of 2 is \(2\).
- The prime factorization of 3 is \(3\).
- The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
- The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3 = 4 \times 3 = 12. \]

So, the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. This means that any number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6 can be written in the form \(12k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).

Next, we need to find a number of the form \(12k + 1\) that is also divisible by 7 and is less than 75. Let's list the numbers of the form \(12k + 1\) that are less than 75:
\[ 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73. \]

Now, we check which of these numbers is divisible by 7:
- \(1 \div 7 = 0\) remainder \(1\) (not divisible by 7).
- \(13 \div 7 = 1\) remainder \(6\) (not divisible by 7).
- \(25 \div 7 = 3\) remainder \(4\) (not divisible by 7).
- \(37 \div 7 = 5\) remainder \(2\) (not divisible by 7).
- \(49 \div 7 = 7\) remainder \(0\) (divisible by 7).
- \(61 \div 7 = 8\) remainder \(5\) (not divisible by 7).
- \(73 \div 7 = 10\) remainder \(3\) (not divisible by 7).

"To find \( f(2015, 2) \), we need to understand the recursive definition of the function \( f \). The function is defined as follows:

\[ f(i, j) = \begin{cases} 
\text{mod}_5 (j+1) & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ and } 0 \le j \le 4, \\ 
f(i-1, 1) & \text{if } i \ge 1 \text{ and } j = 0, \\ 
f(i-1, f(i, j-1)) & \text{if } i \ge 1 \text{ and } 1 \le j \le 4. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's compute the base case when \( i = 0 \):
\[ f(0, j) = \text{mod}_5 (j+1) \]
So, we have:
\[ f(0, 0) = 1, \]
\[ f(0, 1) = 2, \]
\[ f(0, 2) = 3, \]
\[ f(0, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(0, 4) = 0. \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of the function for \( i \ge 1 \). Let's compute \( f(1, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
\[ f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2, \]
\[ f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 3, \]
\[ f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0, 4) = 0, \]
\[ f(1, 4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0, 0) = 1. \]

Now, let's compute \( f(2, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
\[ f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3, \]
\[ f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) = f(1, 3) = 0, \]
\[ f(2, 2) = f(1, f(2, 1)) = f(1, 0) = 2, \]
\[ f(2, 3) = f(1, f(2, 2)) = f(1, 2) = 4, \]
\[ f(2, 4) = f(1, f(2, 3)) = f(1, 4) = 1. \]

We observe that \( f(2, j) \) is periodic with a period of 5. Specifically, \( f(2, j) = f(0, j+3) \). This pattern suggests that \( f(i, j) \) is periodic in \( i \) with a period of 5. Therefore, we can reduce \( i \) modulo 5:
\[ f(2015, 2) = f(5 \cdot 403 + 0, 2) = f(0, 2) = 3. \]

"To find the value of \(\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2\), we start by interpreting the given equations geometrically. The equations represent the squared distances between the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 9,

\[
(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2 = 16,
\]
\[
(x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2 = 25.
\]

These distances correspond to the sides of a triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5. Since \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\), the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle between the sides of lengths 3 and 4.

The area \(A\) of a right triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its base and height:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6.
\]

The area of a triangle can also be expressed using the determinant of a matrix formed by the coordinates of its vertices. For the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\), the area is given by:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \right|.

\[
6 = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \right|.

\[
\left| \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \right| = 12.

Finally, we need to find the square of this determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2 = 12^2 = 144.

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the relationship between triangles \( ABC \) and \( AMN \):**
   Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \( AMN \):**
   The area of triangle \( ABC \) is given as 144. Thus, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

4. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \), triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) are similar. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) is the same as the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \( 1:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) is \( \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \).

5. **Calculate the area of triangle \( EBC \):**
   The area of triangle \( EBC \) is one-third of the area of triangle \( ABC \) because the median \( BE \) divides triangle \( ABC \) into two triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \( EBC \) is:

"To determine the probability that three randomly chosen points from a 3x3 grid lie on the same straight line, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to choose three points from the grid and then count the number of ways to choose three points that lie on the same straight line.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose three points from the grid
The grid has 9 points, and we need to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{9}{3} \):
\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9!}{3!6!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84

### Step 2: Count the number of ways to choose three points that lie on the same straight line
In a 3x3 grid, there are 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal) that each contain 3 points. Therefore, there are a total of \( 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 \) sets of three points that lie on the same straight line.

### Step 3: Calculate the probability
The probability that three randomly chosen points lie on the same straight line is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{total}} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 8 \times 4 = 32.

"To find the maximum value of \(\angle APB\), we start by defining the positions of the runners and the observer. Let the speed of runner \(A\) be \(v\). Since runner \(B\) runs three times as fast as runner \(A\), the speed of runner \(B\) is \(3v\).

Let \(t\) be the time in seconds after they start running. The position of runner \(A\) at time \(t\) is \((vt, 0)\) and the position of runner \(B\) at time \(t\) is \((3vt, 0)\). The observer is at point \(P\) with coordinates \((0, h)\), where \(h\) is the distance from \(P\) to the line running.

The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is given by:

The distance from \(P\) to \(B\) is given by:
\[
PB = \sqrt{(3vt - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2} = \sqrt{9v^2t^2 + h^2}

The angle \(\angle APB\) can be found using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle APB\):
\[
AB^2 = PA^2 + PB^2 - 2 \cdot PA \cdot PB \cdot \cos \angle APB
\]
Since \(AB = 3vt - vt = 2vt\), we substitute the known values:
\[
(2vt)^2 = (v^2t^2 + h^2) + (9v^2t^2 + h^2) - 2 \cdot \sqrt{v^2t^2 + h^2} \cdot \sqrt{9v^2t^2 + h^2} \cdot \cos \angle APB

Let \(y = \frac{h^2}{x}\). Then:
\[

Define \(f(y) = \frac{3 + y}{\sqrt{(1 + y)(9 + y)}}\). To find the minimum value of \(f(y)\), we take the derivative and set it to zero. However, a simpler approach is to test the boundary values and critical points. As \(y \to 0\):

As \(y \to \infty\):

"To rewrite the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\) in the form \((x + b)^2 + c\), we need to complete the square. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the coefficient of \(x\)**: The coefficient of \(x\) is 2.6. To complete the square, we take half of this coefficient, square it, and then add and subtract this value inside the equation.

2. **Calculate half of the coefficient and square it**: Half of 2.6 is 1.3, and squaring 1.3 gives \(1.3^2 = 1.69\).

3. **Rewrite the quadratic expression by adding and subtracting this square inside the equation**:
   \[
   x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 = (x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + 3.6 - 1.69

1. **Count the total number of integers in the set:**
   The set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) contains 100 integers.

2. **Count the number of integers divisible by 2:**
   An integer \(n\) is divisible by 2 if \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). The largest integer \(k\) such that \(2k \leq 100\) is 50. Therefore, there are 50 integers in the set that are divisible by 2.

   An integer \(n\) is divisible by both 2 and 3 if \(n = 6k\) for some integer \(k\). The largest integer \(k\) such that \(6k \leq 100\) is 16. Therefore, there are 16 integers in the set that are divisible by 6.

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\), we start by simplifying the expression. Notice that it is a difference of squares:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2 = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2.
\]

We need to maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\). Since \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is a decreasing function of \(b\) and \(a^2\) is an increasing function of \(|a|\), the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) will occur when \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized and \(a^2\) is minimized. Given the ranges \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\), the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is \(\frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}\) and the minimum value of \(a^2\) is \((-2)^2 = 4\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}.

"To simplify the expression \(\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ\), we start by expressing \(\tan 100^\circ\) in terms of sine and cosine. Recall that \(\tan 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is \(\cos 100^\circ\), so we rewrite \(4 \sin 100^\circ\) as \(\frac{4 \sin 100^\circ \cos 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}\):

\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ \cos 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]

Next, we factor out \(\sin 100^\circ\) from the numerator:

\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ \cos 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} = \frac{\sin 100^\circ (1 + 4 \cos 100^\circ)}{\cos 100^\circ}
\]

This can be separated into two fractions:

\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ (1 + 4 \cos 100^\circ)}{\cos 100^\circ} = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} \cdot (1 + 4 \cos 100^\circ) = \tan 100^\circ \cdot (1 + 4 \cos 100^\circ)
\]

We know that \(\tan 100^\circ = -\tan 80^\circ\) and \(\cos 100^\circ = -\cos 80^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\tan 100^\circ \cdot (1 + 4 \cos 100^\circ) = -\tan 80^\circ \cdot (1 + 4(-\cos 80^\circ)) = -\tan 80^\circ \cdot (1 - 4 \cos 80^\circ)
\]

We need to find the value of \(1 - 4 \cos 80^\circ\). Using the triple angle identity for cosine, we know that \(\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta\). Setting \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\cos 60^\circ = 4 \cos^3 20^\circ - 3 \cos 20^\circ
\]

Since \(\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = 4 \cos^3 20^\circ - 3 \cos 20^\circ
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
8 \cos^3 20^\circ - 6 \cos 20^\circ - 1 = 0
\]

We also know that \(\cos 80^\circ = 2 \cos^2 40^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos 40^\circ = 2 \cos^2 20^\circ - 1\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known value of \(\cos 80^\circ\). From trigonometric tables or a calculator, we find that:

\[
\cos 80^\circ \approx 0.1736
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - 4 \cos 80^\circ \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.1736 = 1 - 0.6944 = 0.3056
\]

However, we can use the exact value of \(\cos 80^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 80^\circ\). From the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 80^\circ}\) and \(\tan 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 80^\circ}{\cos 80^\circ}\), we can find that:

\[
1 - 4 \cos 80^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 80^\circ}
\]

Therefore:

\[
-\tan 80^\circ \cdot (1 - 4 \cos 80^\circ) = -\tan 80^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{\tan 80^\circ} = -1

"To determine the measure of angle \( \angle BAC \), we need to analyze the geometric properties of the square and the regular heptagon that share the common side \( \overline{AD} \).

First, let's consider the regular heptagon. The measure of each interior angle of a regular heptagon is given by:
\[
\frac{(7-2) \times 180^\circ}{7} = \frac{5 \times 180^\circ}{7} = \frac{900^\circ}{7}
\]
Since \( \overline{AD} \) is a side of the heptagon, the angle \( \angle BAD \) is the interior angle of the heptagon at vertex \( A \), which is \( \frac{900^\circ}{7} \).

Next, let's consider the square. The measure of each interior angle of a square is \( 90^\circ \). Since \( \overline{AD} \) is also a side of the square, the angle \( \angle CAD \) is the interior angle of the square at vertex \( A \), which is \( 90^\circ \).

Now, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle BAC \). This angle is the difference between \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle CAD \):
\[
\angle BAC = \angle BAD - \angle CAD = \frac{900^\circ}{7} - 90^\circ

To subtract these angles, we need a common denominator. The angle \( 90^\circ \) can be written as \( \frac{630^\circ}{7} \):
\[
\angle BAC = \frac{900^\circ}{7} - \frac{630^\circ}{7} = \frac{270^\circ}{7}

"To determine the value of \( n \) such that there are exactly 70 squares of three different sizes on a \( 3 \times n \) grid, we need to count the number of squares of each size and then set up an equation based on the total number of squares.

### Step 1: Count the number of squares of each size

#### Squares of size \( 1 \times 1 \)
For a \( 3 \times n \) grid, the number of \( 1 \times 1 \) squares is:
\[
3 \times (n-1) = 3n - 3

For a \( 3 \times n \) grid, the number of \( 3 \times 3 \) squares is:
\[
1 \times (n-3) = n - 3
\]

### Step 2: Set up the equation
The total number of squares is the sum of the squares of each size:
\[
(3n - 3) + (2n - 4) + (n - 3) = 6n - 10
\]
We know that the total number of squares is 70, so we set up the equation:
\[
6n - 10 = 70
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( n \)
Add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[
6n = 80
\]
Divide both sides by 6:
\[
n = \frac{80}{6} = \frac{40}{3}
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that there are three different sizes of squares, and the total number of squares is 70. The correct equation should be:
\[

First, substitute \( y = x^2 - 8 \) into \( y^2 = -5x + 44 \):

Expanding the left side, we get:

The product of the \( y \)-coordinates of the solutions is:

\]
To find this product, we can use the fact that the polynomial \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \) can be factored or solved using numerical methods, but a more straightforward approach is to use Vieta's formulas and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, note that the polynomial \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \) can be factored as:

The product of the \( y \)-coordinates is:

Using the difference of squares, we get:
\[

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]

"To find the value of \(a\) such that the sum of the geometric series \(4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots\) is a perfect square, we start by identifying the first term and the common ratio of the series. The first term \(a_1\) is 4, and the common ratio \(r\) is \(\frac{\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \frac{3}{a}\).

The sum \(S\) of an infinite geometric series with \(|r| < 1\) is given by the formula:
\[
S = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}
\]
Substituting the values of \(a_1\) and \(r\) into the formula, we get:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4}{\frac{a-3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a-3}
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect square. Let \(k\) be an integer such that:
\[
\frac{4a}{a-3} = k^2
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
4a = k^2(a-3) \implies 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \implies 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \implies a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \implies a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2 \implies a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}
\]
For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(k^2 - 4\) must be a positive divisor of \(3k^2\). Since \(k^2 - 4 = (k-2)(k+2)\), \(k\) must be greater than 2. We will test the smallest integer values of \(k\) greater than 2 to find the smallest possible value of \(a\).

1. If \(k = 3\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 3^2}{3^2 - 4} = \frac{27}{9 - 4} = \frac{27}{5} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

2. If \(k = 4\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{4^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{16 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4 \quad \text{(an integer)}
\]

3. If \(k = 5\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 5^2}{5^2 - 4} = \frac{75}{25 - 4} = \frac{75}{21} = \frac{25}{7} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \(k > 5\), the value of \(a\) will be greater than 4. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \(a\) is 4.

To verify, we substitute \(a = 4\) back into the sum of the series:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{4}} = 16
\]
Since 16 is a perfect square, the value of \(a\) is indeed correct.

Thus, the value of the smallest possible \(a\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

1. Set \( x = 0 \) in the equation of the parabola:
   \[
   0 = y^2 - 4y - 1
   \]

2. This simplifies to the quadratic equation:
   \[

3. To find the number of solutions to this quadratic equation, we can use the discriminant \( D \) of the quadratic equation \( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \), which is given by:
   \[
   D = b^2 - 4ac

"To find the minimum value of \( |m - n| \) given that \( 3m + 4n = 100 \), we start by expressing \( m \) in terms of \( n \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4n}{3} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 100 - 4n \) must be divisible by 3. We can check the divisibility by finding the remainder when 100 is divided by 3:

\[ 100 \div 3 = 33 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

So, \( 100 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \). Therefore, we need:

\[ 1 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 4n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]

This means that \( n \) can be written as:

\[ n = 3k + 1 \]

for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k + 1 \) into the expression for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4(3k + 1)}{3} = \frac{100 - 12k - 4}{3} = \frac{96 - 12k}{3} = 32 - 4k \]

Now, we need to minimize \( |m - n| \):

\[ |m - n| = |(32 - 4k) - (3k + 1)| = |31 - 7k| \]

To minimize \( |31 - 7k| \), we need to find the integer \( k \) closest to \( \frac{31}{7} \):

\[ \frac{31}{7} \approx 4.4286 \]

The closest integers are \( k = 4 \) and \( k = 5 \). We evaluate \( |31 - 7k| \) for these values:

For \( k = 4 \):

\[ |31 - 7 \cdot 4| = |31 - 28| = 3 \]

For \( k = 5 \):

\[ |31 - 7 \cdot 5| = |31 - 35| = 4 \]

"To find the equation of the plane containing the points \((0, -1, -1)\), \((-4, 4, 4)\), and \((4, 5, 1)\), we start by determining two vectors that lie in the plane. We can do this by finding the vectors between the points.

Let \(\mathbf{v_1} = (-4, 4, 4) - (0, -1, -1) = (-4, 5, 5)\) and \(\mathbf{v_2} = (4, 5, 1) - (0, -1, -1) = (4, 6, 2)\).

Next, we find the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) to the plane by taking the cross product of \(\mathbf{v_1}\) and \(\mathbf{v_2}\):
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v_1} \times \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -4 & 5 & 5 \\ 4 & 6 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(5 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 6) - \mathbf{j}(-4 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 4) + \mathbf{k}(-4 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 4) = \mathbf{i}(10 - 30) - \mathbf{j}(-8 - 20) + \mathbf{k}(-24 - 20) = -20\mathbf{i} + 28\mathbf{j} - 44\mathbf{k}.

Thus, the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n} = (-20, 28, -44)\).

The equation of the plane can be written as:
\[
-20(x - 0) + 28(y + 1) - 44(z + 1) = 0.

"To determine how many two-digit positive integers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these two numbers that are two-digit integers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest power of each prime factor common to both factorizations. Therefore, the GCD of 100 and 150 is:

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}}}\), we will work step by step by expressing the square roots and cube roots as exponents.

First, recall that:
\[
\sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Given the expression:
\[
\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}}}
\]

we start by converting the innermost square root to an exponent:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Next, we convert the cube root to an exponent:
\[
\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

Finally, we convert the outer square root to an exponent:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}} = \left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}}\). Recall that:
\[
\frac{1}{729} = 729^{-1}
\]

So, we have:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}} = \left(729^{-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}} = 729^{-\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Next, we need to express 729 as a power of 3. We know that:
\[
729 = 3^6
\]

Therefore:
\[
729^{-\frac{1}{12}} = \left(3^6\right)^{-\frac{1}{12}} = 3^{6 \cdot -\frac{1}{12}} = 3^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Finally, we convert \(3^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) back to a square root:
\[
3^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) into the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\), we start by rationalizing the denominators of the fractions.

First, consider the term \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Next, consider the term \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

Now, substitute these rationalized forms back into the original expression:
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

Next, combine the like terms involving \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2},
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. Rewrite each fraction with the denominator 6:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6},
\]
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3} \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6} + \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

Thus, the expression \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\) is \(\frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}\), where \(a = 9\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 6\).

Finally, calculate \(a + b + c\):

"To find the set of all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}\), we will analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's denote the expression by \(E\):
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}. \]

### Step 1: Establish a Lower Bound
We will use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for \(E\). Consider the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\) and \(\frac{b}{c}\). By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}. \]
However, this lower bound is not tight enough to find the minimum value of \(E\). Instead, let's consider the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\). Notice that \(\frac{a}{b+c} > 0\). Therefore, we have:
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} > \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}. \]
To find a better lower bound, we can use the Nesbitt's inequality, which states that for positive real numbers \(x, y, z\),
\[ \frac{x}{y+z} + \frac{y}{z+x} + \frac{z}{x+y} \geq \frac{3}{2}. \]
If we set \(x = c\), \(y = a\), and \(z = b+c\), we get:
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 2. \]
This is a better lower bound. To check if this bound is achievable, consider the case when \(a = b\) and \(c = a\). Then,
\[ E = \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a+a} + \frac{a}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 2.5. \]
This is not the minimum value, but it shows that the expression can get close to 2. To find the exact minimum, we need to consider the case when \(a = b\) and \(c \to 0\). Then,
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{a+c} + \frac{a}{c} \to 0 + 1 + \infty = \infty. \]
Therefore, the minimum value of \(E\) is 2.

### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound
To find an upper bound, we can use the fact that \(\frac{a}{b+c} < 1\). Therefore,
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} < \frac{c}{a} + 1 + \frac{b}{c}. \]
As \(a, b, c\) become large, the expression can become arbitrarily large. Therefore, the upper bound is \(\infty\).

### Conclusion
Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the set of all possible values of \(E\) is \([2, \infty)\).

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{[2, \infty)}

Given \( m = 2^{24} \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponents must match when expressing both sides of the equation as powers of 2.

"To determine how many five xu coins Hillary has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of ten xu coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of five xu coins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 xu.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \) (since each ten xu coin is worth 10 xu and each five xu coin is worth 5 xu)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):

First, we subtract \( f(x) \) from \( g(x) \):

\[ g(x) - f(x) = \left( e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235|\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356} + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13 \right) - \left( e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235|\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356} + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 \right) \]

We need to find the values of \( x \) for which \( x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 \). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (12) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

Let's test these possible roots:

We can factor \( x - 1 \) out of \( x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 \) using synthetic division:

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
1 & 1 & -5 & -8 & 12 \\
  &   & 1  & -4 & -12 \\
\hline
  & 1 & -4 & -12 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \( x^2 - 4x - 12 \), so we can write:
\[ x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 4x - 12) \]

Next, we factor \( x^2 - 4x - 12 \):
\[ x^2 - 4x - 12 = (x - 6)(x + 2) \]

So, we have:
\[ x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x - 6)(x + 2) \]

The roots of the equation are \( x = 1, x = 6, \) and \( x = -2 \). The largest of these roots is \( x = 6 \).

Therefore, the value of \( x \) at which the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum length of the cable that can be saved by replacing the cables \(HC\) and \(HD\) with a single cable \(HP\), where \(P\) is a point on the line segment \(CD\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the points:
- \(O = (0, 0)\)
- \(A = (a, 0)\)
- \(B = (-a, 0)\)
- \(C = (-c, 0)\)
- \(D = (d, 0)\)
- \(H = (0, h)\)

Given that the distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is 140 meters, we have:
\[d - (-c) = d + c = 140\]

The length of the cable \(HC\) is 150 meters, so:
\[\sqrt{c^2 + h^2} = 150 \implies c^2 + h^2 = 22500\]

The length of the cable \(HD\) is 130 meters, so:
\[\sqrt{d^2 + h^2} = 130 \implies d^2 + h^2 = 16900\]

We need to find the length of the cable \(HP\), where \(P\) is a point on the line segment \(CD\). Let \(P = (x, 0)\) where \(-c \leq x \leq d\). The length of the cable \(HP\) is:
\[\sqrt{x^2 + h^2}\]

To maximize the length saved, we need to minimize the length of \(HP\). The minimum value of \(HP\) occurs when \(P\) is the point on \(CD\) that is closest to \(H\). This point is the projection of \(H\) onto the line segment \(CD\), which is the point on the x-axis closest to \(H\).

The x-coordinate of \(H\) is 0, so the point \(P\) that minimizes \(HP\) is the point on \(CD\) closest to the y-axis. This point is the point where the perpendicular from \(H\) to \(CD\) intersects \(CD\).

To find this point, we need to solve the system of equations:
\[c^2 + h^2 = 22500\]
\[d^2 + h^2 = 16900\]

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[c^2 - d^2 = 5600\]
\[(c - d)(c + d) = 5600\]
\[(c - d) \cdot 140 = 5600\]
\[c - d = 40\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[c + d = 140\]
\[c - d = 40\]

Add these equations:
\[2c = 180\]
\[c = 90\]

Substitute \(c = 90\) back into the first equation:
\[90 + d = 140\]
\[d = 50\]

Now we know the coordinates of \(C\) and \(D\):
\[C = (-90, 0)\]
\[D = (50, 0)\]

Substitute \(c = 90\) into the equation \(c^2 + h^2 = 22500\):
\[90^2 + h^2 = 22500\]
\[8100 + h^2 = 22500\]
\[h^2 = 14400\]
\[h = 120\]

The coordinates of \(H\) are:
\[H = (0, 120)\]

The length of the cable \(HP\) is minimized when \(P\) is the point on \(CD\) closest to \(H\), which is the point on the x-axis closest to the y-axis. This point is the point where the perpendicular from \(H\) to \(CD\) intersects \(CD\), which is the point on the x-axis closest to the y-axis. This point is the point on the x-axis closest to the y-axis, which is the point on the x-axis closest to the y-axis.

The length of the cable \(HP\) is:
\[\sqrt{0^2 + 120^2} = 120\]

The total length of the original cables \(HC\) and \(HD\) is:
\[150 + 130 = 280\]

The length of the cable \(HP\) is:
\[120\]

The length saved is:
\[280 - 120 = 160\]

Therefore, the maximum length of the cable that can be saved is:

"To find the length of the median \( \overline{QM} \) in \( \triangle PQR \) where \( PQ = QR = 34 \) and \( PR = 32 \), we can use Apollonius's theorem. Apollonius's theorem states that for any triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), and a median \( m_a \) to side \( a \), the following relationship holds:

\[ b^2 + c^2 = 2m_a^2 + 2\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 \]

In this problem, \( PQ = QR = 34 \) and \( PR = 32 \). The median \( \overline{QM} \) is the median to side \( PR \), so \( a = PR = 32 \), \( b = PQ = 34 \), and \( c = QR = 34 \). The median \( m_a = QM \). Substituting these values into Apollonius's theorem, we get:

\[ 34^2 + 34^2 = 2QM^2 + 2\left(\frac{32}{2}\right)^2 \]

"To determine the number of distinct rational roots of the polynomial \(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (here, 1) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (here, 2).

The factors of the constant term 1 are \( \pm 1 \), and the factors of the leading coefficient 2 are \( \pm 1, \pm 2 \). Therefore, the possible rational roots are:
\[ \pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2} \]

We need to check if any of these values are actual roots of the polynomial. Let's substitute each possible root into the polynomial and see if it equals zero.

1. **Check \( x = 1 \):**
   \[ 2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 3 \]

2. **Check \( x = -1 \):**

   For \( x = -1 \) to be a root, \( -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 + 3 = 0 \), which is possible for some integers \( a_3, a_2, a_1 \).

Since each of the possible rational roots \( \pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2} \) can be a root of the polynomial, the number of distinct rational roots that the polynomial can have is 4.

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\), we start by considering the function \(f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\).

First, we will use symmetry and some specific values to get an idea of the maximum value. Let's consider the case when \(x = y\). In this case, the expression becomes:
\[
f(x, x) = \frac{x - x}{x^4 + x^4 + 6} = \frac{0}{2x^4 + 6} = 0.
\]
So, the value of the expression is 0 when \(x = y\).

Next, let's consider the case when \(y = 0\). The expression simplifies to:
\[
f(x, 0) = \frac{x - 0}{x^4 + 0^4 + 6} = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \(g(x) = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(g(x)\) and set it to zero. The derivative is:
\[
g'(x) = \frac{(x^4 + 6) \cdot 1 - x \cdot 4x^3}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{x^4 + 6 - 4x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{6 - 3x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
6 - 3x^4 = 0 \implies x^4 = 2 \implies x = \sqrt[4]{2}.
\]
We substitute \(x = \sqrt[4]{2}\) back into the function \(g(x)\):
\[
g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{(\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}.
\]
Since \(\sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{1/4}\), we have:
\[
g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{2^{1/4}}{8} = \frac{2^{1/4}}{2^3} = 2^{1/4 - 3} = 2^{-11/4} = \frac{1}{2^{11/4}} = \frac{1}{2^{2.75}} = \frac{1}{2^2 \cdot 2^{0.75}} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 2^{0.75}}.
\]
To find the numerical value, we note that \(2^{0.75} = \sqrt[4]{8}\), so:
\[
g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{1}{4 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}}.
\]
However, we can also check the value of the expression for \(x = -\sqrt[4]{2}\):
\[
g(-\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{(-\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{8} = -\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}.
\]
Since \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\) is positive and \(-\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\) is negative, the maximum value of the expression is \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4 \cdot 2^{0.75}}}\).","[1/(4*2**0.75), '\\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 2^{0.75}}']",\frac{1}{4},"[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",False

\[ p(4) = (4-1)(4-2)(4-3)(4-r) = (3)(2)(1)(4-r) = 6(4-r) = 24 - 6r \]

\[
42 \times 19 = 42 \times (20 - 1) = 42 \times 20 - 42 \times 1 = 840 - 42 = 798

Next, we add \(441\), \(798\), and \(361\) together:

   This means \( N \) can be written in the form:
   \[
   N = 6m + 3
   \]
   for some integer \( m \).

### Step 2: Find the common values of \( N \)
We need to find the values of \( N \) that satisfy both congruences simultaneously. That is, we need to solve the system of congruences:
\[
N \equiv 5 \pmod{8}
\]
\[
N \equiv 3 \pmod{6}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( N = 8k + 5 \) into the second congruence
Substitute \( N = 8k + 5 \) into \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \):
\[
8k + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
8k + 5 \equiv 2k + 5 \pmod{6}
\]
So the congruence becomes:
\[
2k + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2k \equiv -2 \pmod{6}
\]
Since \(-2 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\), the congruence is:
\[
2k \equiv 4 \pmod{6}
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
k \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
\]
This means \( k \) can be written in the form:
\[
k = 3n + 2
\]
for some integer \( n \).

### Step 4: Substitute \( k = 3n + 2 \) back into \( N = 8k + 5 \)
Substitute \( k = 3n + 2 \) into \( N = 8k + 5 \):
\[
N = 8(3n + 2) + 5 = 24n + 16 + 5 = 24n + 21
\]
So \( N \) can be written in the form:
\[
N = 24n + 21
\]

### Step 5: Find the values of \( N \) less than 50
We need to find all values of \( N \) such that \( N < 50 \):
\[
24n + 21 < 50
\]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[
24n < 29
\]
Divide both sides by 24:
\[
n < \frac{29}{24} \approx 1.2083
\]
Since \( n \) is an integer, the possible values for \( n \) are 0 and 1.

For \( n = 0 \):
\[
N = 24 \cdot 0 + 21 = 21
\]

For \( n = 1 \):
\[
N = 24 \cdot 1 + 21 = 45
\]

So the possible values of \( N \) are 21 and 45.

### Step 6: Find the sum of all possible values of \( N \)
The sum of the possible values of \( N \) is:
\[
21 + 45 = 66
\]

Therefore, the total of all possible values of \( N \) is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",66,"[66, '66']",True
"To determine the probability that Alice wins the game, we need to consider the sequence of events and the probabilities associated with each event. Let's denote the probability that Alice wins the game as \( P \).

Alice has two possible outcomes on her first turn:
1. She gets heads (H), in which case she wins immediately.
2. She gets tails (T), in which case it is Bob's turn.

If Alice gets tails, Bob then has two possible outcomes:
1. He gets heads (H), in which case he wins immediately.
2. He gets tails (T), in which case it is Alice's turn again.

If Bob gets tails, the game essentially resets to the initial condition where Alice is the first to toss. Therefore, the probability that Alice wins from this point onward is again \( P \).

We can express the total probability \( P \) that Alice wins the game as the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios:
1. Alice wins on her first turn.
2. Alice gets tails, Bob gets tails, and Alice wins the game from there.

The probability that Alice wins on her first turn is \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since the probability of getting heads is \( \frac{1}{2} \)).

The probability that Alice gets tails and Bob gets tails is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \), and in this case, the probability that Alice wins the game is \( P \).

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}P \]

To solve for \( P \), we first isolate \( P \) on one side of the equation:
\[ P - \frac{1}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ P = \frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the probability that Alice wins the game is \( \boxed{\frac{2}{3}} \).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{2}{3},"[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",True
"To find the remainder when the polynomial \( P(x) = (5x + 9)^{611} + (x + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1 \) is divided by \( x + 2 \), we can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \( P(x) \) by \( x - c \) is \( P(c) \). In this case, we need to find \( P(-2) \).

Let's substitute \( x = -2 \) into the polynomial \( P(x) \):

\[
P(-2) = (5(-2) + 9)^{611} + ((-2) + 5)^{11} + ((-2) - 1)^{11} + 3(-2)^2 + 1
\]

First, simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
5(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1
\]
\[
(-2) + 5 = 3
\]
\[
(-2) - 1 = -3
\]
\[
3(-2)^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]

Now substitute these values back into the expression for \( P(-2) \):

\[
P(-2) = (-1)^{611} + 3^{11} + (-3)^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

Next, evaluate each power:

\[
(-1)^{611} = -1 \quad \text{(since 611 is odd)}
\]
\[
3^{11} = 177147
\]
\[
(-3)^{11} = -177147 \quad \text{(since 11 is odd)}
\]

Now substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 177147 - 177147 + 12 + 1
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 0 + 12 + 1 = 12
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \( (5x + 9)^{611} + (x + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1 \) is divided by \( x + 2 \) is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"Given that \(a, b, c, d\) are complex numbers with \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 0\), we need to find the maximum value of \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\).

First, note that since \(a, b, c, d\) lie on the unit circle, we can write them as \(a = e^{i\alpha}\), \(b = e^{i\beta}\), \(c = e^{i\gamma}\), and \(d = e^{i\delta}\) for some real numbers \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\). The condition \(a + b + c + d = 0\) implies that the sum of these complex numbers is zero, which geometrically means that the points \(a, b, c, d\) form a quadrilateral that is symmetric about the origin.

A natural choice for such points is the vertices of a square inscribed in the unit circle. Let's consider \(a = 1\), \(b = i\), \(c = -1\), and \(d = -i\). These points satisfy \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 1 + i - 1 - i = 0\).

Now, we need to compute \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\):
\[
a + b = 1 + i, \quad a + c = 1 - 1 = 0, \quad a + d = 1 - i,
\]
\[
b + c = i - 1, \quad b + d = i - i = 0, \quad c + d = -1 - i.
\]
Since \(a + c = 0\) and \(b + d = 0\), the product \((a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)\) contains the factor \(0\). Therefore, the value of the product is \(0\).

However, we need to consider other possible configurations of \(a, b, c, d\) that might give a non-zero maximum value. Let's consider the case where \(a, b, c, d\) are the vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the unit sphere in the complex plane (which is actually a circle in this context). In this case, the points are the fourth roots of unity, which are \(1, -1, i, -i\). We have already computed this case and found the product to be \(0\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\) is \(\boxed{16}\). This value is achieved when \(a, b, c, d\) are the vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the unit sphere, which is actually a circle in this context. The correct configuration is \(a = 1\), \(b = \omega\), \(c = \omega^2\), and \(d = \omega^3\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 4} = i\).

Let's denote these vectors as \(\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). We need to find scalars \(a\) and \(b\) such that:
\[
a \mathbf{v}_1 + b \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This gives us the system of linear equations:
\[
a \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + b \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix},

which can be written as:
\[
\begin{cases}
3a - 5b = -13, \\
a + 2b = 3, \\
2b = 4.
\end{cases}
\]
From the third equation, we get:
\[
b = 2.
\]
Substituting \(b = 2\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
a + 2(2) = 3 \implies a + 4 = 3 \implies a = -1.
\]
So, the scalars are \(a = -1\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = -1 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we can find \(\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -13 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\) using the linearity of matrix multiplication:

We know from the problem statement that:
\[
\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -5 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[

\]
we need to eliminate the parameter \( t \) and express \( y \) as a function of \( x \).

First, let's write the parametric equations for \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
x = 8 + 2t,
\]
\[
y = -1 + 3t.
\]

We can solve the equation for \( x \) in terms of \( t \):
\[
x - 8 = 2t,
\]
\[
t = \frac{x - 8}{2}.
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( t \) into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = -1 + 3\left(\frac{x - 8}{2}\right).
\]

Now, we simplify the right-hand side:
\[
y = -1 + \frac{3(x - 8)}{2},
\]
\[
y = -1 + \frac{3x - 24}{2},

\[

Since he has 8 different types of toppings to choose from, and he needs to select 2 different toppings, the number of ways to choose 2 different toppings from 8 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{8}{2} \).

The combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \) is defined as:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 8 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!}

We can simplify the factorials by canceling out the \( 6! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine how many positive integers within the first 100 numbers are divisible by \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. A number divisible by all three must be divisible by their LCM.

First, we find the prime factorizations of \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\):
- \(3\) is a prime number: \(3 = 3^1\)
- \(4 = 2^2\)
- \(5\) is a prime number: \(5 = 5^1\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(3, 4, 5) = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 = 60

Thus, any number divisible by \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\) must be divisible by \(60\).

Next, we need to find how many positive integers within the first 100 numbers are divisible by \(60\). We do this by dividing \(100\) by \(60\) and taking the floor of the result:
\[

First, we need to determine the range of possible values for \( \text{AB} \). Since \( \text{AB} \) is a two-digit number, it ranges from 10 to 99. We need to find which of these numbers, when cubed, equals 912,673.

We start by taking the cube root of 912,673:
\[
\sqrt[3]{912,673} \approx 97
\]
This tells us that \( \text{AB} \) is close to 97. We will now check the cubes of the numbers around 97 to see which one equals 912,673.

First, we check \( 97^3 \):
\[
97^3 = 97 \times 97 \times 97 = 9409 \times 97 = 912,673

So, \( \text{AB} = 97 \).

First, let's identify the two shaded triangles in the figure:
1. The first triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

We will calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of the first triangle.**

The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the x-axis, which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4

**Step 2: Calculate the area of the second triangle.**

The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 3 units. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the x-axis, which is 4 units.

- Each correct answer gives \( 5 \) points.
- Each incorrect answer deducts \( 2 \) points.
- Each unanswered question gives \( 0 \) points.

Frank's total score can be calculated using the following equation:

\[
\text{Total Score} = (5 \times \text{correct answers}) + (-2 \times \text{incorrect answers})

Substituting the variables we defined:

"To find the value of the infinite series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\), where \(F_n\) is the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number, we start by using the Fibonacci recurrence relation \(F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n\). This allows us to rewrite the general term of the series as follows:

\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)}.
\]

We can decompose this fraction using partial fractions. We look for constants \(A\) and \(B\) such that:

\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{A}{F_n} + \frac{B}{F_{n+1} + F_n}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)\) gives:

\[
F_{n+1} = A (F_{n+1} + F_n) + B F_n.
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we get:

\[
F_{n+1} = A F_{n+1} + A F_n + B F_n = A F_{n+1} + (A + B) F_n.
\]

For this equation to hold for all \(n\), the coefficients of \(F_{n+1}\) and \(F_n\) on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we have the system of equations:

\[
A = 1,
\]
\[
A + B = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, we find \(A = 1\) and \(B = -1\). Thus, we can write:

\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+1} + F_n} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}}.
\]

The series now becomes a telescoping series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}} \right).
\]

In a telescoping series, most terms cancel out. Writing out the first few terms, we get:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{F_1} - \frac{1}{F_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_2} - \frac{1}{F_4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_3} - \frac{1}{F_5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_4} - \frac{1}{F_6} \right) + \cdots.
\]

All intermediate terms cancel, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{F_1} + \frac{1}{F_2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = 2.

"To find the value of \(x^3 - 2x + 1\) given that \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\), we can use the given equation to express higher powers of \(x\) in terms of lower powers. Let's start by solving the given equation for \(x^2\):

\[x^2 = x + 1.\]

Now, we need to express \(x^3\) in terms of \(x\) and \(x^2\). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation \(x^2 = x + 1\) by \(x\):

\[x^3 = x \cdot x^2 = x(x + 1) = x^2 + x.\]

Next, we substitute \(x^2 = x + 1\) into the expression for \(x^3\):

\[x^3 = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1.\]

Now, we substitute \(x^3 = 2x + 1\) into the original expression \(x^3 - 2x + 1\):

\[x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2x + 1 - 2x + 1 = 2.\]

"To determine the value of 56 Drinkets in terms of Trinkets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Drinkets to Blinkets.
2. Convert Blinkets to Trinkets.

First, we know that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. Therefore, to find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets, we can use the following proportion:
\[
\frac{3 \text{ Blinkets}}{7 \text{ Drinkets}} = \frac{x \text{ Blinkets}}{56 \text{ Drinkets}}
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{3 \text{ Blinkets} \times 56 \text{ Drinkets}}{7 \text{ Drinkets}} = \frac{168 \text{ Blinkets} \cdot \text{Drinkets}}{7 \text{ Drinkets}} = 24 \text{ Blinkets}
\]
So, 56 Drinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets.

Next, we know that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets. Therefore, to find out how many Trinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets, we can use the following proportion:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ Trinket}}{4 \text{ Blinkets}} = \frac{y \text{ Trinkets}}{24 \text{ Blinkets}}
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{1 \text{ Trinket} \times 24 \text{ Blinkets}}{4 \text{ Blinkets}} = \frac{24 \text{ Trinkets} \cdot \text{Blinkets}}{4 \text{ Blinkets}} = 6 \text{ Trinkets}

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of the number 450. The number 450 can be factored into its prime factors as follows:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's analyze these divisibility rules one by one:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9.

Since the number must end in 00, we only need to find the smallest number composed of the digits 0 and 1 whose sum of the digits is divisible by 9. The smallest such number is 111111111 (since \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\)).

Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1 is:

\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)

In our case, the coordinates of the points are:

"To determine the probability that a chessboard square is colored, we first need to understand the coloring pattern of a chessboard. A standard chessboard has 64 squares, with half of them being black and the other half being white. Therefore, there are 32 black squares and 32 white squares.

The problem involves two random numbers, one for the column and one for the row, which determine the position of a chessboard square. The first number, when divided by 4, gives a remainder of 1, 2, or 3, which determines the column. The second number, when divided by 5, gives a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4, which determines the row.

Since the remainders are equally likely, each column and each row has an equal probability of being chosen. Therefore, each of the 16 possible squares (4 columns and 4 rows) has a probability of \(\frac{1}{16}\) of being chosen.

Next, we need to determine how many of these 16 squares are colored. In a standard chessboard, the squares are alternately colored black and white. If we consider the top-left square as black, then the squares in the first row will be black, white, black, white, and the squares in the second row will be white, black, white, black, and so on. This pattern repeats every two rows and every two columns.

In a 4x4 grid, there are 2 black squares and 2 white squares in each row and each column. Therefore, the 16 squares can be divided into 8 black squares and 8 white squares.

Since each of the 16 squares has an equal probability of being chosen, the probability that the chosen square is black is \(\frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the probability that the chessboard square where the knight is placed is colored is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To determine how much milk is left in the pail when Sam gets home, we need to calculate the amount of milk consumed during each leg of his trip and then find the remaining amount after all legs.

1. **Initial amount of milk:**
   Sam starts with a pail containing 2 gallons of milk.

2. **Milk consumed per leg:**
   Each leg of the trip is 1 mile (since 3 miles total divided by 3 legs is 1 mile per leg). After each mile, the amount of milk left is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the amount at the start of that leg. Therefore, the amount of milk consumed per leg is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the amount at the start of that leg.

3. **Calculating the milk left after each leg:**
   - **First leg:**
     - Initial amount: 2 gallons
     - Amount consumed: \(2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\) gallons
     - Amount left: \(2 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) gallons

   - **Second leg:**
     - Initial amount: \(\frac{4}{3}\) gallons
     - Amount consumed: \(\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{9}\) gallons
     - Amount left: \(\frac{4}{3} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{12}{9} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{8}{9}\) gallons

\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5
\]

For \( 240k \) to be a perfect cube, each exponent in the prime factorization of \( 240k \) must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we need to determine the smallest \( k \) that will make each exponent in the factorization of \( 240k \) a multiple of 3.

The prime factorization of \( 240k \) is:

\[
240k = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times k

To make \( 240k \) a perfect cube, \( k \) must provide the missing factors \( 2^2 \), \( 3^2 \), and \( 5^2 \). Therefore, the smallest \( k \) is:

"To find the area of \(\triangle CDE\), we start by noting that \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}\) and \(BD = 4BC\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle CDE\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, because they share \(\angle ACB\) and have corresponding angles \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle CDE\) that are equal due to the parallel lines.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their heights from the same vertex. Since \(BD = 4BC\), the total length \(CD = BC + BD = BC + 4BC = 5BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides \(CD\) to \(CB\) is \(5:1\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is \(5^2 = 25\) times the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 6 cm², the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction. The denominator can be rewritten as:

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can apply this identity to the terms \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

First, let's rewrite the expression for clarity:

(3x-2)(4x+1)-(3x-2)4x+1

We can start by expanding the term \((3x-2)(4x+1)\):
\[
(3x-2)(4x+1) = 3x \cdot 4x + 3x \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 4x - 2 \cdot 1 = 12x^2 + 3x - 8x - 2 = 12x^2 - 5x - 2
\]

Now, substitute this back into the original expression:
\[
12x^2 - 5x - 2 - (3x-2)4x + 1
\]

Next, expand the term \((3x-2)4x\):
\[
(3x-2)4x = 3x \cdot 4x - 2 \cdot 4x = 12x^2 - 8x
\]

Now substitute this back into the expression:
\[
12x^2 - 5x - 2 - (12x^2 - 8x) + 1
\]

Distribute the negative sign through the parentheses:
\[
12x^2 - 5x - 2 - 12x^2 + 8x + 1

Combine like terms:
\[
(12x^2 - 12x^2) + (-5x + 8x) + (-2 + 1) = 0 + 3x - 1 = 3x - 1

The distance from a point \( (x, y, z) \) to a plane \( ax + by + cz + d = 0 \) is given by:
\[
\frac{|ax + by + cz + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}.

1. The distance \( d_1 \) from \( P \) to the plane \( x - z = 0 \) is:

Simplifying, we have:

To eliminate the denominators, we multiply through by 6:

\[

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{3}xz + \frac{1}{36} + y^2 + z^2 - \frac{1}{36} = 36,

- Let \( A \) be Amy's current age.
- Let \( B \) be Ben's current age.
- Let \( C \) be Chris's current age.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The average age of Amy, Ben, and Chris is 6.
2. Four years ago, Chris was equal to Amy's current age.
3. In four years, Ben's age will be \(\frac{3}{5}\) of Amy's age.

We can translate these statements into equations:

1. The average age equation:
   \[
   \frac{A + B + C}{3} = 6
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
   \[
   A + B + C = 18
   \]

2. Four years ago, Chris was equal to Amy's current age:
   \[
   C - 4 = A
   \]
   Rearranging this equation, we get:
   \[
   C = A + 4
   \]

3. In four years, Ben's age will be \(\frac{3}{5}\) of Amy's age:
   \[
   B + 4 = \frac{3}{5}(A + 4)
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   5(B + 4) = 3(A + 4)
   \]
   Expanding both sides, we get:
   \[
   5B + 20 = 3A + 12

   Rearranging this equation, we get:
   \[
   5B = 3A - 8

   \[
   B = \frac{3A - 8}{5}

Now we have a system of three equations:
1. \( A + B + C = 18 \)
2. \( C = A + 4 \)
3. \( B = \frac{3A - 8}{5} \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( C \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

Combine the terms involving \( A \):
\[
A + A + 4 + \frac{3A - 8}{5} = 18
\]
\[
2A + 4 + \frac{3A - 8}{5} = 18
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
2A + \frac{3A - 8}{5} = 14
\]
To clear the fraction, multiply every term by 5:
\[
10A + 3A - 8 = 70

Add 8 to both sides:
\[

Divide both sides by 13:
\[
A = 6

"Given that \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a 1997th root of unity. The 1997th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{1997} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the non-1 roots satisfy the equation \(x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the sum
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.
\]
Since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), the sum can be rewritten as
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Now, we need to find the value of
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}}.
\]
Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of \(P(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{1996}\). We can use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of \(1 + x\) evaluated at the roots of a polynomial. If \(P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0\) has roots \(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\), then
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{1 + r_k} = \frac{a_n + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1}{a_n + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0}.
\]
For the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{1996} + x^{1995} + \cdots + x + 1\), we have \(a_n = 1\), \(a_{n-1} = 1\), \(\ldots\), \(a_1 = 1\), and \(a_0 = 1\). Therefore,

Adding the term \(\frac{1}{2}\) to this sum, we get

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the property of the cross product that relates the magnitude of the cross product to the magnitudes of the vectors and the sine of the angle between them. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest angle, we have:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

### Step 1: Convert \(0.\overline{7}\) to a fraction
Let \(x = 0.\overline{7}\). Then, \(10x = 7.\overline{7}\). Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, we get:
\[10x - x = 7.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{7} \implies 9x = 7 \implies x = \frac{7}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(0.\overline{4}\) to a fraction
Let \(y = 0.\overline{4}\). Then, \(10y = 4.\overline{4}\). Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, we get:
\[10y - y = 4.\overline{4} - 0.\overline{4} \implies 9y = 4 \implies y = \frac{4}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{9}\).

### Step 3: Convert \(0.\overline{2}\) to a fraction
Let \(z = 0.\overline{2}\). Then, \(10z = 2.\overline{2}\). Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, we get:

"To find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) given the equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\), we can start by multiplying all three equations together. This gives us:

(xy)(xz)(yz) = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(xyz)^2 = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72

Next, we calculate the right side. First, we multiply 24 and 48:

\[
24 \cdot 48 = 1152
\]

Then, we multiply the result by 72:

\[
1152 \cdot 72 = 82944

So, we have:

\[

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

Now that we have \(xyz = 288\), we can find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) by dividing \(xyz\) by each of the original equations. First, we find \(x\):

Finally, we find \(z\):

The function is undefined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed in mathematics.

The denominator of the function is \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \). We need to solve the equation:

\[ |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| = 0 \]

Since the absolute value of any real number is non-negative, the sum of two absolute values is zero if and only if each absolute value is zero. Therefore, we need to solve the system of equations:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0 \]

First, let's solve \( x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \). We can factorize this quadratic equation as follows:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = (x + 4)(x - 1) = 0 \]

So, the solutions are:

So, the solutions are:

\[ x = -4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -5 \]

The only value of \( x \) that satisfies both equations is \( x = -4 \). Therefore, the denominator \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \) is zero when \( x = -4 \).

First, consider the parallelogram defined by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax + d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx + d\). The vertical distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax + d\) is \(d - c\), and the vertical distance between the lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx + d\) is also \(d - c\). The horizontal distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = bx + c\) is the same as the horizontal distance between the lines \(y = ax + d\) and \(y = bx + d\), which is \(\frac{d - c}{b - a}\). Therefore, the area of this parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = (d - c) \cdot \frac{d - c}{b - a} = \frac{(d - c)^2}{b - a}
\]
We are given that this area is 18, so:
\[
\frac{(d - c)^2}{b - a} = 18 \implies (d - c)^2 = 18(b - a)
\]

Next, consider the parallelogram defined by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax - d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx - d\). The vertical distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax - d\) is \(c + d\), and the vertical distance between the lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx - d\) is also \(c + d\). The horizontal distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = bx + c\) is the same as the horizontal distance between the lines \(y = ax - d\) and \(y = bx - d\), which is \(\frac{c + d}{b - a}\). Therefore, the area of this parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = (c + d) \cdot \frac{c + d}{b - a} = \frac{(c + d)^2}{b - a}
\]
We are given that this area is 72, so:
\[
\frac{(c + d)^2}{b - a} = 72 \implies (c + d)^2 = 72(b - a)
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \((d - c)^2 = 18(b - a)\)
2. \((c + d)^2 = 72(b - a)\)

We can divide the second equation by the first equation to eliminate \(b - a\):
\[
\frac{(c + d)^2}{(d - c)^2} = \frac{72}{18} = 4 \implies \left(\frac{c + d}{d - c}\right)^2 = 4 \implies \frac{c + d}{d - c} = 2 \implies c + d = 2(d - c) \implies c + d = 2d - 2c \implies 3c = d \implies d = 3c
\]

Substituting \(d = 3c\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
(3c - c)^2 = 18(b - a) \implies (2c)^2 = 18(b - a) \implies 4c^2 = 18(b - a) \implies 2c^2 = 9(b - a) \implies b - a = \frac{2c^2}{9}
\]

Since \(b\) and \(a\) are integers, \(c\) must be a multiple of 3. Let \(c = 3k\), where \(k\) is a positive integer. Then:
\[
d = 3c = 9k \quad \text{and} \quad b - a = \frac{2(3k)^2}{9} = \frac{2 \cdot 9k^2}{9} = 2k^2
\]

To minimize \(a + b + c + d\), we choose the smallest positive integer for \(k\), which is 1. Then:
\[
c = 3, \quad d = 9, \quad b - a = 2 \implies b = a + 2
\]

The smallest positive integer for \(a\) is 1, so:
\[
a = 1, \quad b = 3
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(a + b + c + d\) is:

The distance \(d\) between the origin \((0,0)\) and the point \((x, \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9)\) is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2}

To minimize \(d\), it is equivalent to minimize \(d^2\):
\[
d^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2

\[
d^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 9x^2 + 81\right) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 8x^2 + 81
\]
Let \(u = x^2\). Then the expression becomes a function of \(u\):
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81
\]
To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we take the derivative with respect to \(u\) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{du}\left(\frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81\right) = \frac{1}{2}u - 8
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[
\frac{1}{2}u - 8 = 0 \implies u = 16

To confirm that this value of \(u\) gives a minimum, we check the second derivative:
\[
\frac{d^2}{du^2}\left(\frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the second derivative is positive, the function has a minimum at \(u = 16\). Substituting \(u = 16\) back into the expression for \(d^2\), we get:
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{4}(16)^2 - 8(16) + 81 = \frac{1}{4}(256) - 128 + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all the interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:

2. **Express the given information in terms of the sum of all interior angles:**
   According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\). Let the measure of the missing angle be \(x\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   The measure of an interior angle of a convex polygon is always less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

5. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find the value of \(n\) such that the equation \((n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x\) holds true for some \(x\) in the range \(0 < x < 180^\circ\).

   First, let's find the approximate value of \(n\) by ignoring \(x\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we consider \(n = 7\) and \(n = 8\).

   If \(n = 7\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ

   Since \(x\) cannot be negative, \(n = 7\) is not a valid solution.

7. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ

   Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) would be:

   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

\[ f(1) = 1^{10} + 5 \cdot 1^9 - 8 \cdot 1^8 + 7 \cdot 1^7 - 1^6 - 12 \cdot 1^5 + 4 \cdot 1^4 - 8 \cdot 1^3 + 12 \cdot 1^2 - 5 \cdot 1 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = 1 + 5 - 8 + 7 - 1 - 12 + 4 - 8 + 12 - 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = -7 \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(-1) \):

\[ f(-1) = (-1)^{10} + 5 \cdot (-1)^9 - 8 \cdot (-1)^8 + 7 \cdot (-1)^7 - (-1)^6 - 12 \cdot (-1)^5 + 4 \cdot (-1)^4 - 8 \cdot (-1)^3 + 12 \cdot (-1)^2 - 5 \cdot (-1) - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 15 \]

Now we have the system of equations:

\[ a + b = -7 \]
\[ -a + b = 15 \]

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:

\[ (a + b) + (-a + b) = -7 + 15 \]
\[ 2b = 8 \]
\[ b = 4 \]

Next, we substitute \( b = 4 \) back into the first equation:

\[ a + 4 = -7 \]
\[ a = -11 \]

Therefore, the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \) is:

"To determine how many dinners the 12 friends should order to have enough food for all of them, we need to follow these steps:

"To find \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\), we first need to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). The characteristic polynomial of \(\mathbf{A}\) is given by:

\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 7 \\ -1 & -2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) - (-1)(7) = \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1.
\]

The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvalues of \(\mathbf{A}\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Let \(\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). These eigenvalues satisfy \(\lambda_1^2 = \lambda_1 - 1\) and \(\lambda_2^2 = \lambda_2 - 1\). We can use these relations to find higher powers of \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\).

First, we compute \(\lambda_1^3\):

\[
\lambda_1^3 = \lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_1^2 = \lambda_1 (\lambda_1 - 1) = \lambda_1^2 - \lambda_1 = (\lambda_1 - 1) - \lambda_1 = -1.
\]

Similarly, we compute \(\lambda_2^3\):

\[
\lambda_2^3 = \lambda_2 \cdot \lambda_2^2 = \lambda_2 (\lambda_2 - 1) = \lambda_2^2 - \lambda_2 = (\lambda_2 - 1) - \lambda_2 = -1.
\]

Thus, \(\lambda_1^3 = \lambda_2^3 = -1\). This implies that \(\lambda_1^{27} = (\lambda_1^3)^9 = (-1)^9 = -1\), \(\lambda_1^{31} = \lambda_1^3 \cdot \lambda_1^{28} = -1 \cdot (\lambda_1^3)^9 \cdot \lambda_1^2 = -1 \cdot (-1)^9 \cdot \lambda_1^2 = -\lambda_1^2 = -(\lambda_1 - 1) = 1 - \lambda_1\), and \(\lambda_1^{40} = (\lambda_1^3)^{13} \cdot \lambda_1 = (-1)^{13} \cdot \lambda_1 = -\lambda_1\).

Similarly, \(\lambda_2^{27} = -1\), \(\lambda_2^{31} = 1 - \lambda_2\), and \(\lambda_2^{40} = -\lambda_2\).

Since \(\mathbf{A}\) is diagonalizable, we can write \(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{P}^{-1}\), where \(\mathbf{D}\) is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\). Therefore,

\[
\mathbf{A}^{27} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D}^{27} \mathbf{P}^{-1}, \quad \mathbf{A}^{31} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D}^{31} \mathbf{P}^{-1}, \quad \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D}^{40} \mathbf{P}^{-1}.
\]

Adding these together, we get:

\[
\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{P} (\mathbf{D}^{27} + \mathbf{D}^{31} + \mathbf{D}^{40}) \mathbf{P}^{-1}.
\]

The diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{D}^{27} + \mathbf{D}^{31} + \mathbf{D}^{40}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{D}^{27} + \mathbf{D}^{31} + \mathbf{D}^{40} = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1^{27} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^{27} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1^{31} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^{31} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1^{40} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^{40} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 + (1 - \lambda_1) + (-\lambda_1) & 0 \\ 0 & -1 + (1 - \lambda_2) + (-\lambda_2) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2\lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & -2\lambda_2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = 1\), we have:

\[
-2\lambda_1 = -2 \left( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = -1 - i\sqrt{3}, \quad -2\lambda_2 = -2 \left( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = -1 + i\sqrt{3}.
\]

Thus,

\[
\mathbf{D}^{27} + \mathbf{D}^{31} + \mathbf{D}^{40} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 - i\sqrt{3} & 0 \\ 0 & -1 + i\sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore,

\[
\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{P} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - i\sqrt{3} & 0 \\ 0 & -1 + i\sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{P}^{-1}.
\]

However, we can also find the sum directly by noting that the sum of the elements in each row of \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\) is the same as the sum of the elements in each row of \(\mathbf{A}\) raised to the respective power. Since the sum of the elements in each row of \(\mathbf{A}\) is \(3 + (-1) = 2\), the sum of the elements in each row of \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\) is \(2\).

Thus, the sum of the elements in each row of \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\) is:

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \) is symmetric around 0 modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 = 1 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 = 4 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 = 9 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ t = -1 \pm 5 \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). However, we need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd. Since 4 is even, it is not a solution.

We need to consider the other possible value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23, which is \( -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ t = -1 \pm 18 \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \]

Since we are looking for \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -19 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). Since 17 is odd, it is a solution.

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is:

"To find the value of \(a + b + m\), we need to determine the x-intercept \(a\), the y-intercept \(b\), and the slope \(m\) of the line given by the equation \(\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1\).

**Step 1: Find the x-intercept \(a\).**

The x-intercept is the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\). Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{x}{4} = 1 \implies x = 4.
\]
So, the x-intercept \(a\) is 4.

**Step 2: Find the y-intercept \(b\).**

The y-intercept is the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies y = 12.
\]
So, the y-intercept \(b\) is 12.

**Step 3: Find the slope \(m\).**

The equation of the line in intercept form is \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\). To convert this to slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\), we start with:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1.
\]
Multiply every term by 12 to clear the denominators:
\[
3x + y = 12.
\]
Rearrange to solve for \(y\):
\[
y = -3x + 12.
\]
From this, we can see that the slope \(m\) is \(-3\).

**Step 4: Calculate \(a + b + m\).**

Now that we have \(a = 4\), \(b = 12\), and \(m = -3\), we can find \(a + b + m\):
\[
a + b + m = 4 + 12 - 3 = 13.

Therefore, the value of \(a + b + m\) is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 6 cars such that each of the three directions (left, straight, right) has at least one car. Let's denote the number of cars going left as \( L \), the number of cars going straight as \( S \), and the number of cars going right as \( R \). We need to find the number of solutions to the equation \( L + S + R = 6 \) where \( L, S, R \geq 1 \).

First, we make a substitution to convert this into a problem of finding non-negative integer solutions. Let \( L' = L - 1 \), \( S' = S - 1 \), and \( R' = R - 1 \). Then \( L', S', R' \geq 0 \) and the equation becomes \( L' + S' + R' = 3 \).

The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is given by the ""stars and bars"" theorem, which states that the number of solutions to \( x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n \) is \( \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} \). Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), so the number of solutions is \( \binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).

For each of these 10 ways to distribute the cars among the three directions, we need to arrange the 6 cars in a sequence. The number of ways to arrange 6 cars where \( L \) cars go left, \( S \) cars go straight, and \( R \) cars go right is given by the multinomial coefficient \( \frac{6!}{L!S!R!} \).

Since the sum \( L + S + R = 6 \) and \( L, S, R \geq 1 \), the possible values for \( (L, S, R) \) are all the permutations of \( (1, 1, 4) \), \( (1, 2, 3) \), and \( (2, 2, 2) \).

1. For \( (L, S, R) = (1, 1, 4) \), the number of arrangements is \( \frac{6!}{1!1!4!} = 30 \).
2. For \( (L, S, R) = (1, 2, 3) \), the number of arrangements is \( \frac{6!}{1!2!3!} = 60 \).
3. For \( (L, S, R) = (2, 2, 2) \), the number of arrangements is \( \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90 \).

Now, we sum these for all 10 combinations of \( (L, S, R) \):
- There are 3 combinations of \( (1, 1, 4) \) (i.e., \( (1, 1, 4) \), \( (1, 4, 1) \), \( (4, 1, 1) \)), each contributing 30 arrangements, so \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \).
- There are 6 combinations of \( (1, 2, 3) \) (i.e., \( (1, 2, 3) \), \( (1, 3, 2) \), \( (2, 1, 3) \), \( (2, 3, 1) \), \( (3, 1, 2) \), \( (3, 2, 1) \)), each contributing 60 arrangements, so \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \).
- There is 1 combination of \( (2, 2, 2) \), contributing 90 arrangements, so \( 1 \times 90 = 90 \).

Adding these together, the total number of ways to arrange the cars is \( 90 + 360 + 90 = 540 \).

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(4(x + 7)(2 - x)\), we start by expanding the expression inside the parentheses. The expression becomes:

This is a quadratic function in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a = -4\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 56\). Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative (\(a = -4\)), the parabola opens downwards, and the function has a maximum value at its vertex.

The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is found using the formula \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Substituting the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we get:

\[x = -\frac{-20}{2(-4)} = -\frac{20}{8} = -\frac{5}{2}.\]

Next, we substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) back into the original expression to find the maximum value:

\[4\left(-\frac{5}{2} + 7\right)\left(2 - \left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)\right) = 4\left(-\frac{5}{2} + \frac{14}{2}\right)\left(2 + \frac{5}{2}\right) = 4\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)\left(\frac{9}{2}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{81}{4} = 81.\]

"To determine the number of different ways Pat can select six pieces of pizza from a pizza box containing pizza slices of three different types (pepperoni, mushroom, and cheese), we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6\), where \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\) represent the number of pepperoni, mushroom, and cheese slices selected, respectively.

\[ r^2 = x^2 + y^2. \]

We also use the double-angle identity for cosine:
\[ \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta. \]

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} \) and \( \sin \theta = \frac{y}{r} \) into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[ \cos 2\theta = \left( \frac{x}{r} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{y}{r} \right)^2 = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2}. \]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}\), we will follow these steps:

2. Multiply the fractions together.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}
\]

First, we convert the division by \(\frac{12}{20}\) to multiplication by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of \(\frac{12}{20}\) is \(\frac{20}{12}\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{20}{12}

Next, we simplify \(\frac{20}{12}\). The greatest common divisor of 20 and 12 is 4, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:

Now, the expression is:

From this, we can express \( g \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
g = \frac{4}{3}y

Next, we are told that if we add 5 green balls and remove 3 yellow balls, the new ratio of green balls to yellow balls becomes 7:3. This gives us another equation:

\]

Now we can substitute \( g \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
\frac{\frac{4}{3}y + 5}{y - 3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by \( 3(y - 3) \):

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[

"To find the measure of \(\angle ABC\), we need to use the dot product formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The vectors we are interested in are \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\).

First, let's find the vectors \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)
\]

Next, we calculate the dot product \(\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27
\]

Now, we find the magnitudes of \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\|\overrightarrow{BA}\| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

\[
\|\overrightarrow{BC}\| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

Using the dot product formula \(\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = \|\overrightarrow{BA}\| \|\overrightarrow{BC}\| \cos \theta\), we can solve for \(\cos \theta\):

"To solve the equation \(10^x - 10 = 9990\), we will follow these steps:

1. Isolate the term involving \(x\).
2. Solve for \(x\) by expressing it as a logarithm.

Step 1: Isolate the term involving \(x\).
The given equation is:
\[10^x - 10 = 9990\]
To isolate \(10^x\), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[10^x = 9990 + 10\]
\[10^x = 10000\]

Step 2: Solve for \(x\) by expressing it as a logarithm.
We know that \(10^x = 10000\) can be rewritten using logarithms. Specifically, if \(a^b = c\), then \(b = \log_a c\). Here, \(a = 10\), \(b = x\), and \(c = 10000\). Therefore, we have:
\[x = \log_{10} 10000\]
We also know that \(10000 = 10^4\), so:

"To determine the number of sides of a regular polygon where the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the relationship between interior and exterior angles:**
   The sum of the measures of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is always \(180^\circ\). Let the measure of the exterior angle be \(x\). Then, the measure of the interior angle is \(6.5x\).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the interior angle and the exterior angle add up to \(180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   6.5x + x = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   7.5x = 180^\circ
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   To find the measure of the exterior angle, we divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{180^\circ}{7.5} = 24^\circ
   \]
   So, the measure of the exterior angle is \(24^\circ\).

4. **Determine the number of sides of the polygon:**
   The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\). For a regular polygon, all exterior angles are equal. If the measure of one exterior angle is \(24^\circ\), then the number of sides \(n\) of the polygon can be found by dividing \(360^\circ\) by \(24^\circ\):

"To solve for the length of \( BH \), we start by analyzing the given geometric shapes and their properties. We know that \( CDEG \) is a square with side length \( CD = 3 \), and \( BEFH \) is a rectangle with \( BE = 5 \).

First, we need to determine the coordinates of the points. Let's place point \( C \) at the origin \((0, 0)\). Then, point \( D \) will be at \((3, 0)\), point \( E \) at \((3, 3)\), and point \( G \) at \((0, 3)\).

Since \( BEFH \) is a rectangle and \( BE = 5 \), point \( E \) is at \((3, 3)\) and point \( B \) is at \((3, 0)\), point \( F \) must be at \((3, 5)\) and point \( H \) must be at \((x, 5)\) for some \( x \).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of point \( H \). Point \( H \) is the intersection of the line segment \( AG \) and the vertical line through \( F \). The line segment \( AG \) passes through points \( A \) and \( G \). Since \( A \) is at \((0, 0)\) and \( G \) is at \((0, 3)\), the line \( AG \) is the vertical line \( x = 0 \).

However, we need to find the intersection of the line segment \( AG \) with the vertical line through \( F \), which is \( x = 3 \). The line \( AG \) is actually the line \( y = x \) (since it passes through the origin and has a slope of 1). Therefore, the intersection of \( y = x \) and \( x = 3 \) is at \( (3, 3) \).

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   The numbers are selected from 1 to 100, inclusive. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 100.

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   A favorable outcome is a number that is a multiple of 3. We need to find how many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   The smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 3, and the largest is 99. The sequence of multiples of 3 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 3, the common difference \(d\) is 3, and the last term \(a_n\) is 99.
   The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

   Substituting the known values, we get:

   - \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangent lines to the circle at points \( O \) and \( N \), respectively.
   - \( O \) and \( N \) are points of tangency.

2. **Use the properties of tangents:**
   - A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
   - Therefore, \( HO \perp JO \) and \( HN \perp JN \).

3. **Determine the angles formed by the tangents and the radii:**
   - Since \( HO \perp JO \), \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \).
   - Since \( HN \perp JN \), \( \angle HNJ = 90^\circ \).

4. **Analyze the quadrilateral \( HOJN \):**
   - Quadrilateral \( HOJN \) has four angles: \( \angle HOJ \), \( \angle HNJ \), \( \angle J \), and \( \angle H \).
   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \).

For \( n = 10 \), the sum \( S \) is:

\[ S = \frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we need to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 9. We do this by performing the division:

"To determine the number of different ways to arrange 2 gold medals for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and 2 gold medals for the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) in a row, we need to consider that the gold medals for each competition are identical within their respective groups.

This is a problem of arranging 4 items where 2 items are identical of one type and 2 items are identical of another type. The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

In this problem, we have 4 items in total (2 gold medals for IMO and 2 gold medals for IPhO), so \( n = 4 \). The frequency of each type of gold medal is 2, so \( n_1 = 2 \) and \( n_2 = 2 \).

- The full price for one ticket is $20.
- The discount per ticket is \(25\% \times 20 = 0.25 \times 20 = 5\) dollars.
- The price of one ticket after the discount is \(20 - 5 = 15\) dollars.

This means we need to solve the equation:

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). This can be rewritten as:

\[997x - 1000k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(997\) and \(1000\):

\[1000 = 1 \cdot 997 + 3\]
\[997 = 332 \cdot 3 + 1\]
\[3 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(997\) and \(1000\) are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(997\) and \(1000\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 3\]

Substitute \(3\) from the first equation:

\[3 = 1000 - 1 \cdot 997\]

So,

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot (1000 - 1 \cdot 997)\]
\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 1000 + 332 \cdot 997\]

\[1 = (1 + 332) \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]

To eliminate the repeating part, we multiply both sides of the equation by \(10000\):

Now, we subtract the original equation \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\) from this new equation:

\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11^2 \times 101\]

"To find the perimeter of the set \( S \), we need to consider the shape formed by the union of the interior of a regular nonagon with side length 2 and the set of points that are within a distance of 1 unit from any point on the perimeter of the nonagon.

First, let's analyze the perimeter of the original nonagon. A regular nonagon has 9 equal sides, and each side is 2 units long. Therefore, the perimeter of the nonagon is:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ units}
\]

Next, we need to consider the additional perimeter contributed by the points that are within 1 unit of the perimeter of the nonagon. These points form a region that extends 1 unit outward from each side of the nonagon and also adds additional perimeter at the vertices of the nonagon.

For each side of the nonagon, the region within 1 unit forms a rectangle with a length equal to the side length of the nonagon (2 units) and a width of 1 unit. The perimeter of each such rectangle is:
\[
2 \times (2 + 1) = 6 \text{ units}
\]
However, since each rectangle shares its two shorter sides with adjacent rectangles, only the two longer sides contribute to the additional perimeter. Therefore, the additional perimeter contributed by each side is:
\[
2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ units}
\]
Since there are 9 sides, the total additional perimeter from all the sides is:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ units}

Additionally, at each vertex of the nonagon, the region within 1 unit forms a quarter-circle with a radius of 1 unit. Since there are 9 vertices, the total perimeter contributed by all the quarter-circles is:
\[

\[ 120 - \sqrt{x} = k^2. \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( \sqrt{x} \), we get

\[ \sqrt{x} = 120 - k^2. \]

Since \( \sqrt{x} \) must be a non-negative real number, it follows that

\[ 120 - k^2 \geq 0. \]

This inequality can be rewritten as

\[ k^2 \leq 120. \]

The largest integer \( k \) that satisfies this inequality is 10, because \( 10^2 = 100 \) and \( 11^2 = 121 \). Therefore, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 10, inclusive. This gives us 11 possible values for \( k \):

\[ k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. \]

For each of these values of \( k \), there is a corresponding non-negative value of \( \sqrt{x} \), and hence a unique non-negative value of \( x \). Specifically,

"To determine the difference in area between the region with the largest area and the region with the smallest area, we need to calculate the area of each of the three regions \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\).

First, we calculate the area of each circle:
- The area of the circle with radius 4 is:
  \[
  \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
  \]
- The area of the circle with radius 6 is:
  \[
  \pi \times 6^2 = 36\pi
  \]
- The area of the circle with radius 7 is:
  \[
  \pi \times 7^2 = 49\pi
  \]

Next, we find the area of each region:
- Region \(X\) is the area of the innermost circle with radius 4, so its area is:
  \[
  16\pi
  \]
- Region \(Y\) is the area between the circle with radius 4 and the circle with radius 6, so its area is:
  \[
  36\pi - 16\pi = 20\pi
  \]
- Region \(Z\) is the area between the circle with radius 6 and the circle with radius 7, so its area is:
  \[
  49\pi - 36\pi = 13\pi
  \]

Now, we identify the largest and smallest areas:
- The largest area is \(49\pi\) (region \(Z\)).
- The smallest area is \(16\pi\) (region \(X\)).

The difference between the largest and smallest areas is:
\[
49\pi - 16\pi = 33\pi

"To determine the number of integer divisors of the number \(a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab\), we start by simplifying the expression. Let's rewrite it step by step:

\[
a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab = 2a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + ab = 2ab
\]

So, the expression simplifies to \(2ab\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct prime numbers greater than 2, both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd primes. Therefore, \(2ab\) is an even number and can be factored as \(2 \times a \times b\).

To find the number of divisors of \(2ab\), we use the property of divisors that if a number \(n\) has the prime factorization \(p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\), then the number of divisors of \(n\) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\).

In the case of \(2ab\), the prime factorization is \(2^1 \times a^1 \times b^1\). Therefore, the number of divisors is:

\[
(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
\]

The divisors of \(2ab\) are \(1, 2, a, b, 2a, 2b, ab, 2ab\).

Thus, the number of integer divisors of \(a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab\) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To determine the measure of angle \( A \) in the given star-shaped figure formed by extending the sides of a regular pentagon \( FGHIJ \), we need to analyze the geometric properties of the pentagon and the star.

First, recall that the interior angle of a regular pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ.
\]
This means each interior angle of the pentagon \( FGHIJ \) is \( 108^\circ \).

When we extend the sides of the pentagon, the star is formed. Consider the triangle \( FGH \). The angles at \( F \) and \( G \) are both \( 108^\circ \) because they are interior angles of the pentagon. The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), so the measure of angle \( H \) in triangle \( FGH \) is:
\[
180^\circ - 108^\circ - 108^\circ = -126^\circ + 180^\circ = 36^\circ.
\]
This angle \( H \) is the same as the angle at \( I \) in the next triangle \( GHI \), and so on. Each of these angles is \( 36^\circ \).

Now, consider the star point \( A \). Angle \( A \) is formed by the extension of sides \( FG \) and \( GH \). The measure of angle \( A \) is the supplement of the interior angle of the pentagon at \( G \) minus the angle \( H \) in triangle \( FGH \):
\[
180^\circ - 108^\circ - 36^\circ = 180^\circ - 144^\circ = 36^\circ.

"To determine the value of the first term in the sequence that is greater than 125, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. The sequence starts with 0, and each subsequent term is generated by either adding or multiplying the previous term by the next integer in sequence.

1. The first term \(a_1\) is 0.
2. The second term \(a_2\) is \(a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\).
3. The third term \(a_3\) is \(a_2 \times 2 = 1 \times 2 = 2\).

"To find the value of \(\left(4\dfrac{5}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}\), we start by converting the mixed number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) into an improper fraction. The number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) can be written as:

\[4\dfrac{5}{8} = 4 + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{32}{8} + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{37}{8}.\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[\left(\dfrac{37}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}.\]

Next, we use the property of exponents that states \(a^m \cdot b^m = (a \cdot b)^m\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\left(\dfrac{37}{8} \cdot \dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}.\]

Now, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[\dfrac{37}{8} \cdot \dfrac{8}{37} = \dfrac{37 \cdot 8}{8 \cdot 37} = \dfrac{296}{296} = 1.\]

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[1^{55}.\]

Since any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1, we have:

"To solve the problem, we need to consider the set \( T \) of all ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers such that there exists a triangle with sides of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The triangle inequality tells us that for any such triple, the following conditions must hold:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

We are asked to find the value of the sum:
\[
\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.
\]

To approach this, we can use the fact that the sum over all positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) without any restrictions is:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \left( \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a \right) \left( \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^b} \right) \left( \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c} \right).
\]

Each of these geometric series can be evaluated as follows:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a = \frac{2}{1-2} = -2,
\]
\[
\sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^b} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2},
\]
\[
\sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{1-\frac{1}{5}} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the product of these sums is:
\[
\left( \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a \right) \left( \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^b} \right) \left( \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c} \right) = (-2) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]

However, this product includes all possible triples \((a, b, c)\), including those that do not satisfy the triangle inequality. To find the sum over only the valid triples, we need to exclude the invalid ones. The invalid triples are those that do not satisfy at least one of the triangle inequalities. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count these invalid triples.

First, we count the number of triples that do not satisfy \(a + b > c\). If \(a + b \leq c\), then \(c \geq a + b\). The number of such triples is:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c} = \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{5^{a+b}}}{1-\frac{1}{5}} = \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{1}{4 \cdot 5^{a+b}} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^a 5^b} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^a} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{15^b} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{1-\frac{1}{5}} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{15}}{1-\frac{1}{15}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{14} = \frac{1}{224}.
\]

Similarly, the number of triples that do not satisfy \(a + c > b\) is:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{c \geq b - a} = \frac{1}{224},

and the number of triples that do not satisfy \(b + c > a\) is:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{c \geq a - b} = \frac{1}{224}.
\]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of invalid triples is:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{224} - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{224} + \frac{1}{224} = \frac{1}{224}.

Thus, the number of valid triples is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{224} = \frac{56}{224} - \frac{1}{224} = \frac{55}{224}.

"To determine after how many seconds the two gears will both have their marks pointing north again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rotations per minute for each gear. The first gear rotates \(33\frac{1}{3}\) times per minute, which is equivalent to \(\frac{100}{3}\) times per minute. The second gear rotates 45 times per minute.

First, we convert the number of rotations per minute to a common unit, which is rotations per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
- The first gear rotates \(\frac{100}{3} \div 60 = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9}\) times per second.
- The second gear rotates \(45 \div 60 = \frac{3}{4}\) times per second.

To find the time after which both gears will have their marks pointing north again, we need to find the LCM of the number of rotations per second. This is equivalent to finding the LCM of the denominators of the fractions when the rotations per second are expressed as fractions with a common numerator. The denominators are 9 and 4, and their LCM is 36.

Therefore, the time after which both gears will have their marks pointing north again is the time it takes for each gear to complete a whole number of rotations that is a multiple of the LCM of their rotations per second. This time is:
\[
\text{LCM} = \frac{1}{\text{GCD}(\frac{5}{9}, \frac{3}{4})} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{36}} = 36 \text{ seconds}

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the minimum value of the expression \((a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right)\), we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality. The AM-HM inequality states that for any positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n}}.
\]

Applying this inequality to the numbers \(a, b, c, d\), we get

\[
\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.

Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain

\[
a + b + c + d \geq \frac{16}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.

Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}\), we get

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) \geq 16.

The equality in the AM-HM inequality holds if and only if \(a = b = c = d\). Let \(a = b = c = d = k\), where \(k\) is a positive real number. Substituting these values into the expression, we get

(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) = (k + k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) = 4k \cdot \frac{4}{k} = 16.

"To find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} = 4r-3\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(2r-7\):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r-3)(2r-7).
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
(4r-3)(2r-7) = 4r \cdot 2r + 4r \cdot (-7) + (-3) \cdot 2r + (-3) \cdot (-7) = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

Now, we set the expanded form equal to the left-hand side of the original equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

To simplify, we move all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0.
\]

We can multiply the entire equation by \(-1\) to make the leading coefficient positive:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0.
\]

Next, we factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \cdot 28 = 56\) and add up to \(-15\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(-8\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r - 4 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
r = \frac{7}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4.
\]

However, we must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they do not make the denominator zero. The original equation is:

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r-7} = 4r-3.
\]

If \( r = \frac{7}{2} \), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is zero, so \( r = \frac{7}{2} \) is not a valid solution. If \( r = 4 \), the denominator is \(2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \neq 0\), so \( r = 4 \) is a valid solution.

x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267
\]
\[
x_{11} = x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 211
\]
\[
x_{12} = x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) = 375
\]

We observe that \( x_{11} = x_1 \) and \( x_{12} = x_2 \). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 8. To confirm, we can check the next few terms:
\[
x_{13} = x_{12} - x_{11} + x_{10} - x_9 = 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523) = 420 = x_3
\]
\[
x_{14} = x_{13} - x_{12} + x_{11} - x_{10} = 420 - 375 + 211 - (-267) = 523 = x_4
\]

Thus, the sequence is indeed periodic with a period of 8. Therefore, we can find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \) by determining their positions within one period.

First, we find the remainder when 531 is divided by 8:
\[
531 \div 8 = 66 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 531 \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{531} = x_3 = 420
\]

Next, we find the remainder when 753 is divided by 8:
\[
753 \div 8 = 94 \text{ remainder } 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 753 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{753} = x_1 = 211
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 975 is divided by 8:
\[
975 \div 8 = 121 \text{ remainder } 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 975 \equiv 7 \pmod{8} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{975} = x_7 = -375
\]

Now, we sum these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + 211 - 375 = 256
\]

Thus, the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \) is \(\boxed{256}\).","[256, '256']",898,"[898, '898']",False
"To find all values of \( p \) that satisfy both inequalities \( 0 \ge 54p - 144 \) and \( 0 > 12 - 20p \), we will solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solution sets.

First, let's solve the inequality \( 0 \ge 54p - 144 \):
\[
0 \ge 54p - 144
\]
Add 144 to both sides:
\[
144 \ge 54p
\]
Divide both sides by 54:
\[
\frac{144}{54} \ge p
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \ge p
\]
or equivalently,
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \( 0 > 12 - 20p \):
\[
0 > 12 - 20p
\]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
-12 > -20p
\]
Divide both sides by -20 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[
\frac{-12}{-20} < p
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{3}{5} < p
\]
or equivalently,
\[
p > \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solution sets \( p \le \frac{8}{3} \) and \( p > \frac{3}{5} \). The intersection of these two sets is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} < p \le \frac{8}{3}

In interval notation, this is written as:

"To solve the equation \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \), we start by rewriting it in a more manageable form. We can factor the equation as follows:

\[
z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = (z^2 + 2zi - 1)(z^2 + 2zi - i) = 0.
\]

This gives us two quadratic equations to solve:

1. \( z^2 + 2zi - 1 = 0 \)
2. \( z^2 + 2zi - i = 0 \)

### Solving the first quadratic equation \( z^2 + 2zi - 1 = 0 \)

Using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1, b = 2i, c = -1 \):

\[
z = \frac{-2i \pm \sqrt{(2i)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2i \pm \sqrt{-4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2i \pm 0}{2} = -i.
\]

Thus, the solution is \( z = -i \).

### Solving the second quadratic equation \( z^2 + 2zi - i = 0 \)

Again, using the quadratic formula with \( a = 1, b = 2i, c = -i \):

\[
z = \frac{-2i \pm \sqrt{(2i)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-i)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2i \pm \sqrt{-4 + 4i}}{2}.
\]

To simplify \( \sqrt{-4 + 4i} \), we can express \( -4 + 4i \) in polar form. The magnitude is:

\[
r = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}.
\]

The angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{-4}\right) = \tan^{-1}(-1) = -\frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

Thus, we can write:

\[
-4 + 4i = 4\sqrt{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right).
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{-4 + 4i} = \sqrt{4\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right) = 2\sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right).
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
z = \frac{-2i \pm 2\sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right)}{2} = -i \pm \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right).
\]

This gives us two solutions:

1. \( z_1 = -i + \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right) \)
2. \( z_2 = -i - \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right) \)

### Finding the vertices of the polygon

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions we found:

1. \( z_1 = -i \)
2. \( z_2 = -i + \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right) \)
3. \( z_3 = -i - \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right) \)

### Calculating the area of the polygon

The vertices form a triangle in the complex plane. The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices \( z_1, z_2, z_3 \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \text{Im}(z_1 \overline{z_2} + z_2 \overline{z_3} + z_3 \overline{z_1}) \right|.
\]

Calculating the area gives us:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \text{Im}((-i)(-i) + (-i + \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right))(-i) + (-i - \sqrt[4]{2} \left( \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \right))(-i)) \right|.
\]

After simplifying, we find that the area can be expressed in the form \( p^{a/b} \).

### Final Calculation

After performing the calculations, we find that the area is \( 2^{1/2} \). Thus, we have:

- \( p = 2 \)
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 2 \)

Finally, we compute:

\[
a + b + p = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine which equation has the solution \( x \) that is the largest, we need to analyze the equations given. Each equation is of the form \( 3(1 + a)^x = 7 \), where \( a \) is a function of \( r \). The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation can be found by solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{\log \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\log (1 + a)} \]

Since \( \log \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \) is a constant, the value of \( x \) depends on the value of \( \log (1 + a) \). The larger the value of \( \log (1 + a) \), the smaller the value of \( x \). Therefore, we need to find the value of \( a \) that is the smallest.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) \( a = r \)
(B) \( a = \frac{r}{10} \)
(C) \( a = 2r \)
(D) \( a = \sqrt{r} \)
(E) \( a = \frac{1}{r} \)

Since \( 0 < r < 3 \), we have:
- \( r \) is between 0 and 3.
- \( \frac{r}{10} \) is between 0 and 0.3.
- \( 2r \) is between 0 and 6.
- \( \sqrt{r} \) is between 0 and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).
- \( \frac{1}{r} \) is between \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \) and \( \infty \).

The smallest value of \( a \) is \( \frac{r}{10} \), which means \( \log \left( 1 + \frac{r}{10} \right) \) is the smallest. Therefore, the value of \( x \) is the largest for the equation \( 3(1 + \frac{r}{10})^x = 7 \).

"To determine the minimum number of pages \( n \) in a book given that the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7 and the number of sheets is greater than 100, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the relationship between the number of pages and sheets:**
   - Each sheet of paper has 2 pages.
   - If the book has \( s \) sheets, then the total number of pages \( n \) is given by:
     \[
     n = 2s
     \]

2. **Set up the conditions:**
   - The number of pages \( n \) is 3 more than a multiple of 7:
     \[
     n \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
     \]
   - The number of sheets \( s \) is greater than 100:
     \[
     s > 100
     \]

3. **Express \( n \) in terms of \( s \):**
   Since \( n = 2s \), we substitute \( n \) in the congruence condition:
   \[
   2s \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
   \]

4. **Solve the congruence \( 2s \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \):**
   To isolate \( s \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7 is a number \( x \) such that:
   \[
   2x \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
   \]
   We can test values of \( x \):
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( x = 3 \): \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( x = 4 \): \( 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
   So, the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7 is 4. We multiply both sides of the congruence \( 2s \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \) by 4:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2s \equiv 4 \cdot 3 \pmod{7}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   8s \equiv 12 \pmod{7}
   \]
   Since \( 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) and \( 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \), we have:
   \[
   s \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
   \]
   This means that \( s \) can be written in the form:
   \[
   s = 7k + 5
   \]
   for some integer \( k \).

5. **Find the minimum \( s \) greater than 100:**
   We need to find the smallest \( k \) such that:
   \[
   7k + 5 > 100
   \]
   Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   7k > 95
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
   \[
   k > \frac{95}{7} \approx 13.5714
   \]
   Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( k \) is 14. Substituting \( k = 14 \) into the expression for \( s \), we get:
   \[
   s = 7 \cdot 14 + 5 = 98 + 5 = 103
   \]

6. **Calculate the corresponding number of pages \( n \):**
   Using \( s = 103 \), we find:
   \[

Therefore, the minimum number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{206}\).","[206, '206']",103,"[103, '103']",False
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[

Now, we add these vectors together:

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values**: The \(x\) values must be strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\), and the \(y\) values must be strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the valid ranges are:

In this case, the denominator is \(11111\), which has 5 digits. Therefore, the repeating block of the decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\) will have 5 digits.

To confirm, we can use the fact that the decimal representation of \(\frac{1}{11111}\) is \(0.\overline{00009}\), which has a repeating block of 5 digits. Multiplying this by 31, we get:
\[
\frac{31}{11111} = 0.\overline{00279}
\]
Thus, the repeating block is ""00279"", which indeed has 5 digits.

Therefore, the number of repeating digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\) is the same as the length of \(\overline{AC}\). Let's denote the length of \(\overline{AC}\) as \(h_1\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1.
\]

Because \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{a}{b}.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h_1\) is also the height of \(\triangle ABC\) from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_1.
\]

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_1 + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h_1.
\]
We know that:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h_1 = 42.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h_1 = 84.
\]

Since \(h_1\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1.
\]

To find \(h_1\), we use the fact that \(h_1 = h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b}.
\]

Since \(a + b = 84\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{84} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides:**
   \[

"To solve the problem, we start by considering a quadratic equation of the form \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\). Let \(c\) be a root of this equation. According to the problem, \(c^2 - 2\) must also be a root of the equation. Since a quadratic equation can have at most two roots, the roots must be \(c\) and \(c^2 - 2\).

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) is \(-a\) and the product of the roots is \(b\). Therefore, we have:
\[c + (c^2 - 2) = -a \quad \text{(1)}\]
\[c(c^2 - 2) = b \quad \text{(2)}\]

From equation (1), we can express \(a\) in terms of \(c\):
\[a = -c^2 - c + 2\]

From equation (2), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(c\):
\[b = c^3 - 2c\]

Now, we need to check if \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root of the equation. Substituting \(x = c^2 - 2\) into the quadratic equation, we get:
\[(c^2 - 2)^2 + a(c^2 - 2) + b = 0\]

Substituting the expressions for \(a\) and \(b\) into this equation, we have:
\[(c^2 - 2)^2 + (-c^2 - c + 2)(c^2 - 2) + (c^3 - 2c) = 0\]

Expanding and simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 - c^4 + 2c^2 - c^3 + 2c + 2c^2 - 4 + c^3 - 2c = 0\]
\[0 = 0\]

This equation is always true, which means that \(c^2 - 2\) is indeed a root of the equation for any value of \(c\). Therefore, the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) can have any value of \(c\) as a root, and the corresponding values of \(a\) and \(b\) are given by:
\[a = -c^2 - c + 2\]

"To determine the range of the function \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the logarithm and then apply the properties of the logarithmic function.

1. **Identify the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\):**
   - The sine function, \(\sin x\), is positive in the interval \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\).
   - The minimum value of \(\sin x\) in this interval is \(\sin 0^\circ = 0\) ( approached as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\)), and the maximum value is \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\).
   - Therefore, the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\) is \(0 < \sin x \leq 1\).

2. **Determine the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\):**
   - Since the square root function is increasing and defined for positive inputs, the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\) will be \(\sqrt{0} < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq \sqrt{1}\), which simplifies to \(0 < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq 1\).

"To find the surface area of one of the parts of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) that is cut by a plane parallel to the edges \(AB\) and \(CD\) and lying halfway between them, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Geometry of the Tetrahedron:**
   A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangle faces, each with side length 2. The height \(h\) of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 is given by:
   \[
   h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 2 = \sqrt{3}
   \]
   The height \(H\) of the tetrahedron can be found using the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron:
   \[
   H = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \times 2 = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}
   \]

2. **Determine the Position of the Plane:**
   The plane is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and lies halfway between them. Therefore, it is at a height of \(\frac{H}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}\) from the base \(CD\).

3. **Find the Shape of the Cross-Section:**
   The cross-section created by this plane is a quadrilateral. Since the plane is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\), the cross-section is a parallelogram. The sides of this parallelogram are parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and are half the length of \(AB\) and \(CD\) because the plane is halfway between them. Therefore, each side of the parallelogram is 1.

4. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram:**
   The area of the parallelogram can be found by considering it as a scaled-down version of the base triangle \(CD\) with a scaling factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\). The area of the base triangle \(CD\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle CD = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2^2 = \sqrt{3}
   \]
   Since the cross-section is a parallelogram with sides half the length of the base triangle, the area of the parallelogram is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the parallelogram} = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

5. **Find the Surface Area of One of the Parts:**
   The original tetrahedron has a total surface area of:
   \[
   \text{Total surface area} = 4 \times \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}
   \]
   The plane cuts the tetrahedron into two parts, one of which is a smaller tetrahedron with a surface area that is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original tetrahedron's surface area (since the plane is halfway between the vertices, the smaller tetrahedron is similar to the original with a scaling factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\)):
   \[
   \text{Surface area of the smaller tetrahedron} = \frac{1}{4} \times 4\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}
   \]
   The other part is a frustum with a surface area that is the remaining part of the original tetrahedron's surface area plus the area of the parallelogram:
   \[
   \text{Surface area of the frustum} = 4\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2}

"To find the smallest possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we need to factorize 84 into its prime factors and then combine these factors in a way that minimizes their sum.

First, let's factorize 84:
\[ 84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \]

We need to express 84 as a product of distinct positive integers. The possible sets of distinct factors are:
1. \( 84 \) (sum = 84)
2. \( 42 \times 2 \) (sum = 44)

7. \( 14 \times 3 \times 2 \) (sum = 21)
8. \( 12 \times 7 \) (sum = 19)
9. \( 12 \times 3 \times 2 \) (sum = 17)
10. \( 7 \times 6 \times 2 \) (sum = 15)

From the above sets, the one with the smallest sum is \( 7 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 \), but it is not valid because it contains repeated factors. The next smallest sum is \( 6 \times 4 \times 3 \), which is also not valid because it contains repeated factors. The next smallest sum is \( 7 \times 4 \times 3 \), which is valid and has a sum of 14.

Next, we sum these results:

   The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   C = 2 \pi r

   \[
   C = 2 \pi \times 9 = 18 \pi \text{ inches}

2. **Determine the number of revolutions per second:**
   The wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds. Therefore, the number of revolutions per second is:
   \[
   \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ revolutions per second}

3. **Calculate the distance traveled per second:**
   Since each revolution covers a distance equal to the circumference of the wheel, the distance traveled per second is:

"To solve the problem, we need to perform two reflections: first, reflect the point \((0,0)\) over the vertical line \(x=1\), and then reflect the resulting point over the horizontal line \(y=2\).

**Step 1: Reflect the point \((0,0)\) over the vertical line \(x=1\).**

The vertical line \(x=1\) is a line of symmetry. To find the image of the point \((0,0)\) when reflected over this line, we need to determine the distance from \((0,0)\) to the line \(x=1\) and then place the image the same distance on the other side of the line.

The distance from \((0,0)\) to \(x=1\) is \(1 - 0 = 1\). Therefore, the image of \((0,0)\) will be at \(1 + 1 = 2\) on the \(x\)-axis. The \(y\)-coordinate remains the same, so the image is \((2,0)\).

\[
a = \frac{2009}{r^2}
\]

Since \(a\) must be a positive integer, \(r^2\) must be a divisor of \(2009\). First, we factorize \(2009\):

\[
2009 = 7^2 \times 41
\]

The divisors of \(2009\) are \(1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009\). Therefore, the possible values for \(r^2\) are \(1, 49\). Since \(a < b < 2009\), \(r\) must be greater than 1. Thus, the only possible value for \(r^2\) is \(49\), which means \(r = 7\).

2. \(3A - 8B = -1\)

We can solve this system by expressing \(A\) in terms of \(B\) from the first equation:

\]

Next, substitute \(A = \frac{10}{B}\) into the second equation:
\[
3\left(\frac{10}{B}\right) - 8B = -1

\[
\frac{30}{B} - 8B = -1

Multiply through by \(B\) to clear the fraction:

\[
B = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16}
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16}

\[
B = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}

This gives us two possible solutions for \(B\):
\[
B = \frac{32}{16} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad B = \frac{-30}{16} = -\frac{15}{8}

Since \(B\) must be an integer, we have \(B = 2\).

Now substitute \(B = 2\) back into the expression for \(A\):

"To determine the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} \), we start by analyzing the expression. Each term in the polynomial is a quadratic polynomial divided by a constant, so each term is a quadratic polynomial.

Let's rewrite \( p(x) \) in a more convenient form. Define:
\[ p(x) = A(x) + B(x) + C(x), \]
where
\[ A(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)}, \]
\[ B(x) = \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)}, \]
\[ C(x) = \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}. \]

Each of \( A(x) \), \( B(x) \), and \( C(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial. To find the degree of \( p(x) \), we need to determine if the terms of degree 2 cancel out. Let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = a \), \( x = b \), and \( x = c \).

First, evaluate \( p(a) \):
\[ p(a) = A(a) + B(a) + C(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. \]

Next, evaluate \( p(b) \):
\[ p(b) = A(b) + B(b) + C(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. \]

Finally, evaluate \( p(c) \):
\[ p(c) = A(c) + B(c) + C(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. \]

We see that \( p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1 \). This means that the polynomial \( p(x) - 1 \) has roots at \( x = a \), \( x = b \), and \( x = c \). Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct, \( p(x) - 1 \) must be a polynomial of degree at least 3. However, \( p(x) \) itself is a polynomial of degree at most 2, so the only way this can happen is if \( p(x) - 1 \) is the zero polynomial. Therefore, \( p(x) = 1 \) for all \( x \).

Thus, the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To combine the fractions \(\frac{4+6a}{5} - \frac{1+3a}{4}\) into a single fraction, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 5 and 4, and the least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 20.

First, we rewrite \(\frac{4+6a}{5}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[
\frac{4+6a}{5} = \frac{(4+6a) \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} = \frac{16 + 24a}{20}
\]

Next, we rewrite \(\frac{1+3a}{4}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[
\frac{1+3a}{4} = \frac{(1+3a) \cdot 5}{4 \cdot 5} = \frac{5 + 15a}{20}
\]

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{16 + 24a}{20} - \frac{5 + 15a}{20} = \frac{(16 + 24a) - (5 + 15a)}{20} = \frac{16 + 24a - 5 - 15a}{20} = \frac{11 + 9a}{20}

"To solve the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \), we first isolate the absolute value expression. Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ |x-4| = 12 \]

The absolute value equation \( |x-4| = 12 \) means that \( x-4 \) can be either 12 or -12. Therefore, we can write two separate equations:

1. \( x-4 = 12 \)
2. \( x-4 = -12 \)

We solve each equation separately.

For the first equation:
\[ x-4 = 12 \]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
\[ x = 16 \]

For the second equation:
\[ x-4 = -12 \]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
\[ x = -8 \]

The solutions to the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \) are \( x = 16 \) and \( x = -8 \). To find the product of these solutions, we multiply them together:

\[ 16 \times (-8) = -128 \]

"To find the value of \(\cos \angle RPS\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle.

Given:
\[
\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}
\]

We need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\). Notice that \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are supplementary angles because they form a straight line. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle RPS = 180^\circ - \angle RPQ
\]

Using the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a supplementary angle, we know:
\[
\cos(180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta
\]

Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\). Then:
\[
\cos \angle RPS = \cos(180^\circ - \angle RPQ) = -\cos \angle RPQ
\]

To find \(\cos \angle RPQ\), we use the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
\]

Substitute \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\) into the identity:
\[
\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1
\]

Calculate \(\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2\):
\[
\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{49}{625} + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1
\]

Subtract \(\frac{49}{625}\) from both sides:
\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \frac{49}{625}
\]

Convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 625:
\[
1 = \frac{625}{625}
\]

So:
\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}
\]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[
\cos \angle RPQ = \pm \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \pm \frac{24}{25}
\]

Since \(\angle RPQ\) is in the first quadrant (as \(\sin \angle RPQ\) is positive), \(\cos \angle RPQ\) is also positive:
\[
\cos \angle RPQ = \frac{24}{25}
\]

Now, substitute \(\cos \angle RPQ\) back into the expression for \(\cos \angle RPS\):
\[
\cos \angle RPS = -\cos \angle RPQ = -\frac{24}{25}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\cos \angle RPS\) is:
\[

"To determine the length of the train, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the speed of the robot.
2. Determine the distance the robot travels in 90 seconds.

First, let's find the speed of the robot. The robot travels 1 km in 2.5 hours. To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the following conversions:
- 1 km = 1000 meters
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds

So, the speed of the robot is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{1 \text{ km}}{2.5 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{2.5 \times 3600 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{1000}{9000} = \frac{1}{9} \text{ meters/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how far the robot travels in 90 seconds. Using the speed we just calculated:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{9} \text{ meters/second} \times 90 \text{ seconds} = 10 \text{ meters}

   \[
   q(x) = bx + 1
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the function \( q(x) \), we get:
   \[
   q(1) = b \cdot 1 + 1 = b + 1

2. Next, we need to substitute \( q(1) \) into the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
   \[
   f(x) = x - 3

   Substituting \( x = b + 1 \) into the function \( f(x) \), we get:

3. According to the given condition, \( f(q(1)) = -3 \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

   b - 2 = -3

4. To solve for \( b \), we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   b - 2 + 2 = -3 + 2

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to be one pair (the other two points will automatically form the other pair). This is given by:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, a simpler way to think about it is to consider the permutations of the points and then divide by the number of ways to arrange the pairs, which is \(2!\). So, the number of ways to pair the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments intersect:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their rotations and reflections). There are exactly 2 such arrangements out of the 6 possible pairings.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the total area of the shaded regions:**
   The total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Identify the shaded regions:**
   The shaded regions consist of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. The sector of the larger circle has a radius of 2 and an angle \(\theta\) (in radians), and the sector of the smaller circle has a radius of 1 and the same angle \(\theta\).

5. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   The area \(A_{\text{large sector}}\) of a sector is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{large sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]

6. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   The area \(A_{\text{small sector}}\) of the sector is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded regions:**
   The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the two sectors:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large sector}} + A_{\text{small sector}} = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
   \]
   We know that \(A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

8. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   To find \(\theta\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

9. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   Since \(\pi\) radians is equal to 180 degrees, we convert \(\theta\) as follows:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical bins are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical bins and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of one cylindrical bin.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical bin. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical bin, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical bins are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical bin:
\[ \text{Number of bins} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"Given that \( P(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 3 with the leading coefficient equal to 1, we can express it as:
\[ P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c. \]

We know that when \( P(x) \) is divided by \( (x-1)(x-4) \), the remainder is \( R(x) \). Since \( R(x) \) must be a polynomial of degree less than 2, we can write:
\[ R(x) = dx + e. \]
Thus, we have:
\[ P(x) = (x-1)(x-4)Q(x) + dx + e \]
for some polynomial \( Q(x) \).

Similarly, when \( P(x) \) is divided by \( (x-2)(x-3) \), the remainder is \( 2R(x) \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ 2R(x) = 2dx + 2e. \]
Thus, we have:
\[ P(x) = (x-2)(x-3)Q_1(x) + 2dx + 2e \]
for some polynomial \( Q_1(x) \).

We are given that \( P(0) = 5 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the first equation, we get:
\[ P(0) = (0-1)(0-4)Q(0) + d \cdot 0 + e = 4Q(0) + e = 5. \]
Since \( Q(0) \) is an integer, we can conclude that \( e = 5 \) (assuming \( Q(0) = 0 \) for simplicity).

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \) into the first equation, we get:
\[ P(1) = d \cdot 1 + e = d + 5, \]
\[ P(4) = d \cdot 4 + e = 4d + 5. \]

Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ P(2) = 2d \cdot 2 + 2e = 4d + 10, \]
\[ P(3) = 2d \cdot 3 + 2e = 6d + 10. \]

We now have the system of equations:
\[ P(1) = d + 5, \]
\[ P(4) = 4d + 5, \]
\[ P(2) = 4d + 10, \]
\[ P(3) = 6d + 10. \]

We can use these equations to find \( d \). Since \( P(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 3, we can use the fact that the coefficients of \( x^2 \), \( x \), and the constant term must match in the two forms of \( P(x) \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( P(x) \) can be written as:
\[ P(x) = (x-1)(x-4)(x-2)(x-3) + R(x). \]

Given that \( R(x) = dx + e \), we can use the values of \( P(x) \) at \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) to find \( d \) and \( e \). From the equations above, we can see that:
\[ P(1) = d + 5, \]
\[ P(4) = 4d + 5, \]
\[ P(2) = 4d + 10, \]
\[ P(3) = 6d + 10. \]

Thus, we have:
\[ P(x) = x^3 - 10x^2 + 31x - 25. \]

Finally, we can find \( P(5) \):
\[ P(5) = 5^3 - 10 \cdot 5^2 + 31 \cdot 5 - 25 = 125 - 250 + 155 - 25 = 5. \]

"To determine the number of distinct values in the range of the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for \( x \in [0, \infty) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the floor function and how the floor function affects it.

First, let's consider the expression \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \). For \( x \) to be a real number, \( x \) must be an even integer because raising a negative number to an odd power results in a negative number, and the floor function of a negative number is not defined in the context of this problem (since we are looking for real values of \( f(x) \)). Therefore, \( x \) must be an even integer.

Let \( x = 2n \) where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. Then the expression becomes \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} \). This is a positive number and it decreases as \( n \) increases.

Now, let's evaluate \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} \) for the first few values of \( n \):
- For \( n = 0 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2 \cdot 0} = 1 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1 \).
- For \( n = 1 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2 \cdot 1} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{64} \approx 0.390625 \). Therefore, \( f(2) = \left\lfloor 0.390625 \right\rfloor = 0 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2 \cdot 2} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{4096} \approx 0.15258789 \). Therefore, \( f(4) = \left\lfloor 0.15258789 \right\rfloor = 0 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2 \cdot 3} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^6 = \frac{15625}{262144} \approx 0.059604645 \). Therefore, \( f(6) = \left\lfloor 0.059604645 \right\rfloor = 0 \).

We observe that as \( n \) increases, \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} \) becomes smaller and smaller, and for \( n \geq 1 \), \( \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} < 1 \). Therefore, \( f(2n) = \left\lfloor \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^{2n} \right\rfloor = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \).

Thus, the only distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) are 1 and 0. Therefore, the number of distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 14 members (8 from the Communist Party and 6 from the Democratic Party) such that the committee includes at least one member from each party.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members without any restrictions. This can be done using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements.

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all from the Communist Party. This is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all from the Democratic Party. This is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all from the Communist Party and the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all from the Democratic Party.

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}+\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}+\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{5}}}\), we will break it down step by step.

First, simplify each term in the numerator:
1. Simplify \(\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{16 \cdot 5}} = \dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5\sqrt{5}}{20} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.
   \]
2. Simplify \(\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9} = \dfrac{\sqrt{169 \cdot 5}}{9} = \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9}.
   \]
3. Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
   \]

Now, substitute these simplified terms back into the numerator:
\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\sqrt{5}.
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Rewrite each term with the denominator 36:
\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} = \dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} = \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
3\sqrt{5} = \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

So, the expression inside the square root becomes:
\[
\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}}}.
\]

Simplify the fraction inside the square root:
\[
\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169}{36}.
\]

Now, take the square root of the result:
\[
\sqrt{\dfrac{169}{36}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{169}}{\sqrt{36}} = \dfrac{13}{6}.

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To find the minimum value of \((x + y)(y + z)\) given that \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\), we start by expressing \((x + y)(y + z)\) in a more convenient form. We have:

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz = y(x + y + z) + xz.
\]

Given the constraint \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\), we can substitute \(x + y + z\) with \(\frac{1}{xyz}\) in the expression:

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = y \cdot \frac{1}{xyz} + xz = \frac{y}{xyz} + xz = \frac{1}{xz} + xz.
\]

Now, let \(t = xz\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
(x + y)(y + z) = \frac{1}{t} + t.
\]

To find the minimum value of \(\frac{1}{t} + t\), we take the derivative with respect to \(t\) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{t} + t \right) = -\frac{1}{t^2} + 1 = 0.
\]

Solving for \(t\), we get:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{t^2} \implies t^2 = 1 \implies t = 1 \quad (\text{since } t = xz > 0).
\]

To confirm that this is a minimum, we check the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left( \frac{1}{t} + t \right) = \frac{2}{t^3}.
\]

Since \(\frac{2}{t^3} > 0\) for \(t > 0\), the function \(\frac{1}{t} + t\) has a local minimum at \(t = 1\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(\frac{1}{t} + t\) is:

\[

"To find the value of the product \(abc\) given the equations \(a + b = 8\), \(b + c = -3\), and \(a + c = -5\), we can start by solving for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) individually.

First, let's add all three equations together:
\[
(a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2a + 2b + 2c = 0
\]
or
\[
a + b + c = 0
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b = 8\)
2. \(b + c = -3\)
3. \(a + c = -5\)
4. \(a + b + c = 0\)

We can use the fourth equation to express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
c = -a - b
\]

Next, substitute \(c = -a - b\) into the second and third equations:
\[
b + (-a - b) = -3 \implies -a = -3 \implies a = 3
\]
\[
a + (-a - b) = -5 \implies -b = -5 \implies b = 5
\]

Now that we have \(a = 3\) and \(b = 5\), substitute these values back into the expression for \(c\):
\[
c = -a - b = -3 - 5 = -8
\]

Thus, the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are \(a = 3\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = -8\). The product \(abc\) is:
\[

"To find the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we first need to understand the pattern in the remainders of the Fibonacci sequence when divided by 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \(F_1 = 1\), \(F_2 = 1\), and \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\) for \(n \geq 3\).

Let's compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&F_1 = 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_2 = 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\

&F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_6 = F_5 + F_4 = 1 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_7 = F_6 + F_5 = 0 + 1 = 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_8 = F_7 + F_6 = 1 + 0 = 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

We observe that \(F_7 \equiv F_1 \pmod{4}\) and \(F_8 \equiv F_2 \pmod{4}\). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6. To confirm, let's compute a few more terms:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&F_9 = F_8 + F_7 = 1 + 1 = 2 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_{10} = F_9 + F_8 = 2 + 1 = 3 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_{11} = F_{10} + F_9 = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \quad \text{(mod 4)}, \\
&F_{12} = F_{11} + F_{10} = 1 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \quad \text{(mod 4)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

 indeed, \(F_{11} \equiv F_5 \pmod{4}\) and \(F_{12} \equiv F_6 \pmod{4}\), confirming that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6.

Since the sequence is periodic with a period of 6, we can find the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4 by finding the remainder when 100 is divided by 6. That is,

\[
100 \div 6 = 16 \text{ remainder } 4.
\]

So, \(100 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\). Therefore, \(F_{100} \equiv F_4 \pmod{4}\). From our earlier computation, we know that \(F_4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the equation of the parabola after it is reflected over the line \( y = k \) and then express the sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f \) in terms of \( k \).

First, let's start with the original equation of the parabola:
\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c. \]
The vertex form of a parabola is given by:
\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k, \]
where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Expanding this, we get:
\[ y = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k. \]
By comparing coefficients with the original equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), we identify:
\[ b = -2ah, \]
\[ c = ah^2 + k. \]

Now, we reflect the parabola over the line \( y = k \). The reflection of a point \((x, y)\) over the line \( y = k \) is \((x, 2k - y)\). Therefore, the equation of the reflected parabola is obtained by replacing \( y \) with \( 2k - y \) in the original equation:
\[ 2k - y = ax^2 + bx + c. \]
Solving for \( y \), we get:
\[ y = -ax^2 - bx + (2k - c). \]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about the angles between the vectors. We know that the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\).

First, let's denote the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) by \(\theta\).

We can use the cosine rule for vectors to find the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\). The cosine of the angle between two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\cos \phi = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}
\]
For \(\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\), we have:
\[
\cos 84^\circ = \frac{\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})}{\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
Expanding the dot product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \|\mathbf{b}\|^2
\]
So,
\[
\cos 84^\circ = \frac{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \|\mathbf{b}\|^2}{\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
We also know that:
\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\cos 84^\circ = \frac{\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ - \|\mathbf{b}\|^2}{\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ - \|\mathbf{b}\|}{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
Next, we need to find the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\). Using the cosine rule again, we have:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
Expanding the dot product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}
\]
So,
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
We also know that:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ}{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|}
\]
From the equation for \(\cos 84^\circ\), we have:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ - \|\mathbf{b}\|}{\cos 84^\circ}
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \(\cos \theta\), we get:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ}{\frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ - \|\mathbf{b}\|}{\cos 84^\circ}} = \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \cos 29^\circ - \|\mathbf{b}\|} \cos 84^\circ = \cos 84^\circ

Since \(\cos 84^\circ = \sin 6^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos \theta = \sin 6^\circ = \cos 84^\circ
\]
Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) is:
\[

"To find the smallest number that is less than two times its reciprocal by one unit, we start by letting the number be \( x \). The reciprocal of \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \), and two times the reciprocal is \( \frac{2}{x} \). According to the problem, the number \( x \) is less than \( \frac{2}{x} \) by one unit. This can be written as the inequality:

\[ x < \frac{2}{x} - 1 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by \( x \):

\[ x^2 < 2 - x \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:

\[ x^2 + x - 2 < 0 \]

We can factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side:

\[ (x + 2)(x - 1) < 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we determine the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:

\[ x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 = 0 \]
\[ x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 \]

These critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -2) \), \( (-2, 1) \), and \( (1, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \( (-\infty, -2) \), choose \( x = -3 \):
   \[ (x + 2)(x - 1) = (-3 + 2)(-3 - 1) = (-1)(-4) = 4 > 0 \]
   The inequality does not hold.

2. For the interval \( (-2, 1) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
   \[ (x + 2)(x - 1) = (0 + 2)(0 - 1) = (2)(-1) = -2 < 0 \]
   The inequality holds.

3. For the interval \( (1, \infty) \), choose \( x = 2 \):
   \[ (x + 2)(x - 1) = (2 + 2)(2 - 1) = (4)(1) = 4 > 0 \]
   The inequality does not hold.

Therefore, the inequality \( (x + 2)(x - 1) < 0 \) holds for \( x \) in the interval \( (-2, 1) \). The smallest number in this interval is \( -2 \). However, we need to verify that \( x = -2 \) satisfies the original inequality:

\[ -2 < -1 - 1 \]
\[ -2 < -2 \]

\[ -1 < \frac{2}{-1} - 1 \]
\[ -1 < -2 - 1 \]
\[ -1 < -3 \]

This is not true, so \( x = -1 \) is not a solution. The next smallest number in the interval \( (-2, 1) \) is any number slightly greater than \( -1 \), but the smallest number that is not an integer is \( -1.5 \). Let's verify \( x = -1.5 \):

\[ -1.5 < -\frac{4}{3} - 1 \]
\[ -1.5 < -1.3333 - 1 \]

\[ -1.25 < \frac{2}{-1.25} - 1 \]

\[ -1.125 < \frac{2}{-1.125} - 1 \]
\[ -1.125 < -1.7778 - 1 \]

\[ -1.03125 < -2.9375 \]

"To find the integer \( x \) that satisfies the inequality \(\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7} < \frac{1}{3}\), we will solve the inequality step by step.

First, let's solve the left part of the inequality:
\[
\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7}
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7):
\[
7 < 4x
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[
\frac{7}{4} < x
\]
\[
1.75 < x
\]
Since \( x \) is an integer, we have:
\[
x > 1.75 \implies x \geq 2
\]

Now, let's solve the right part of the inequality:
\[
\frac{x}{7} < \frac{1}{3}
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides by 21 (the least common multiple of 7 and 3):
\[
3x < 7
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[
x < \frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
x < 2.3333

Since \( x \) is an integer, we have:
\[
x \leq 2

Combining the two results, we get:

"To determine the number of possible car license plates that can be created, we need to consider the choices available for each part of the license plate separately. The license plate consists of 2 letters followed by 2 digits.

1. **Choosing the letters:**
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
   - The first letter can be any of the 26 letters.
   - The second letter must be different from the first, so there are 25 choices for the second letter.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the letters is \(26 \times 25\).

2. **Choosing the digits:**
   - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).
   - The first digit can be any of the 10 digits.
   - The second digit must be different from the first, so there are 9 choices for the second digit.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the digits is \(10 \times 9\).

3. **Combining the choices:**
   - To find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of ways to choose the letters by the number of ways to choose the digits.
   - This gives us \((26 \times 25) \times (10 \times 9)\).

Now, let's perform the multiplication step by step:
\[
26 \times 25 = 650
\]
\[
10 \times 9 = 90

\[
650 \times 90 = 58500

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(n)\) is continuous, we need to ensure that the left-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\) is equal to the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\), and both are equal to \(f(a)\).

The function \(f(n)\) is defined as:
\[ f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n+3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n-12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^-} f(n) = 4a + 3. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^+} f(n) = 7a - 12. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(n = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12. \]

Now, we solve this equation for \(a\):
\[ 3 + 12 = 7a - 4a, \]
\[ 15 = 3a, \]
\[ a = 5. \]

"To find the value of \( t(g(16)) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine the value of \( g(16) \).
2. Then, use the value obtained from step 1 to find \( t(g(16)) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = \sqrt{x} \]
So, we substitute \( x = 16 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

Now, we move to step 2. The function \( t(x) \) is given by:
\[ t(x) = 3 - g(x) \]
But since we need \( t(g(16)) \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) into the function \( t(x) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - g(4) \]
First, we need to find \( g(4) \):
\[ g(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
So, we substitute \( g(4) = 2 \) back into the function \( t(4) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

Therefore, the value of \( t(g(16)) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",66,"[66, '66']",True
"To simplify the expression \(4(3r^3 + 5r - 6) - 6(2r^3 - r^2 + 4r)\), we will first distribute the constants 4 and -6 through their respective parentheses, and then combine like terms.

First, distribute the 4:
\[4(3r^3 + 5r - 6) = 4 \cdot 3r^3 + 4 \cdot 5r + 4 \cdot (-6) = 12r^3 + 20r - 24.\]

Next, distribute the -6:
\[-6(2r^3 - r^2 + 4r) = -6 \cdot 2r^3 + (-6) \cdot (-r^2) + (-6) \cdot 4r = -12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r.\]

Now, combine the two results:
\[12r^3 + 20r - 24 - 12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r.\]

Combine the like terms:
The \(r^3\) terms cancel each other out: \(12r^3 - 12r^3 = 0\).
The \(r\) terms combine as follows: \(20r - 24r = -4r\).
The constant term is \(-24\).
The \(r^2\) term is \(6r^2\).

So, the simplified expression is:
\[6r^2 - 4r - 24.\]

In the form \(Ar^2 + Br + C\), we have \(A = 6\), \(B = -4\), and \(C = -24\).

"To calculate \(\dbinom{31}{28}\), we can use the property of binomial coefficients that \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}\). This property tells us that the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from \(n\) elements is the same as the number of ways to choose \(n-k\) elements from \(n\) elements. Therefore, we can rewrite \(\dbinom{31}{28}\) as \(\dbinom{31}{3}\).

Now, we need to calculate \(\dbinom{31}{3}\). The binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\) is given by the formula:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

For \(\dbinom{31}{3}\), we substitute \(n = 31\) and \(k = 3\):

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31!}{3!(31-3)!} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot 28!}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the \(28!\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29 \times 28!}{3! \times 28!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{3!}
\]

Next, we need to calculate \(3!\):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{6}

Now, we perform the multiplication and division step by step. First, multiply \(31\) and \(30\):

\[
31 \times 30 = 930

Next, multiply the result by \(29\):

\[
930 \times 29 = 26970

Finally, divide by \(6\):

"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, where arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered the same, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without considering rotations:**
   - There are 8 people, and we need to arrange them in 8 seats.
   - The number of ways to arrange 8 people in 8 seats is \(8!\).

2. **Account for rotational symmetry:**
   - Since rotating the arrangement by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees will result in an identical arrangement, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4.
   - Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is \(\frac{8!}{4}\).

We observe that the last digits repeat every 4 powers: 8, 4, 2, 6. To find the last digit of \(8^6\), we need to determine the position of 6 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 6 is divided by 4:
\[
6 \div 4 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2.

The remainder is 2, which means that \(8^6\) has the same last digit as \(8^2\). From our earlier calculation, we know that the last digit of \(8^2\) is 4.

First, let \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta \).

Given \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \), we have \( \angle BDC = 6\theta \).

Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \angle BMD = 90^\circ - (90^\circ - 3\theta) = 3\theta

\[

We know the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}
\]

Let \( \tan(\theta) = t \). Then:
\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}
\]
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}

From \( \tan(2\theta) = \frac{x}{11} \), we have:

From \( \tan(3\theta) = x \), we have:
\[

\]

Equating the two expressions for \( x \):
\[
\frac{22t}{1 - t^2} = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
22t(1 - 3t^2) = (3t - t^3)(1 - t^2)
\]
\[

\[

\[
t^5 - 62t^3 + 19t = 0

\[
t(t^4 - 62t^2 + 19) = 0

Since \( t \neq 0 \):
\[
t^4 - 62t^2 + 19 = 0

Let \( u = t^2 \). Then:
\[
u^2 - 62u + 19 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
u = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{62^2 - 4 \cdot 19}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{3844 - 76}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{3768}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm 2\sqrt{942}}{2} = 31 \pm \sqrt{942}

Since \( u = t^2 \) must be positive and less than 1:
\[
u = 31 - \sqrt{942}
\]

Thus:
\[
t^2 = 31 - \sqrt{942}

Now, we find \( x \):
\[

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then find the median.

First, let's denote the 27 consecutive integers as:
\[a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\]
where \(a\) is the smallest integer in the sequence.

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. Here, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), so the sum is:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right) = 27 \left(a + 13\right)
\]
We know that the sum of these 27 integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:
\[
27 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

Next, we need to express \(ab\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that \(a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}\), so \(ab \leq \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{4}\). However, to find the exact minimum, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry arguments. Let's assume \(a = b\). Then \(x = 2a\) and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(2a + y)[(2a)^2 + (2a + 4y)^2]}{a^2 y} = \frac{(2a + y)(4a^2 + (2a + 4y)^2)}{a^2 y}.
\]

Expanding the term \((2a + 4y)^2\), we get:

\[
(2a + 4y)^2 = 4a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(2a + y)(4a^2 + 4a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2)}{a^2 y} = \frac{(2a + y)(8a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2)}{a^2 y}.
\]

Factoring out a 8 from the numerator, we get:

\[
\frac{8(2a + y)(a^2 + 2ay + 2y^2)}{a^2 y}.
\]

Expanding the product \((2a + y)(a^2 + 2ay + 2y^2)\), we get:

\[
(2a + y)(a^2 + 2ay + 2y^2) = 2a^3 + 4a^2 y + 4ay^2 + a^2 y + 2ay^2 + 2y^3 = 2a^3 + 5a^2 y + 6ay^2 + 2y^3.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{8(2a^3 + 5a^2 y + 6ay^2 + 2y^3)}{a^2 y} = 8\left(\frac{2a^3}{a^2 y} + \frac{5a^2 y}{a^2 y} + \frac{6ay^2}{a^2 y} + \frac{2y^3}{a^2 y}\right) = 8\left(\frac{2a}{y} + 5 + \frac{6y}{a} + \frac{2y^2}{a^2}\right).
\]

To minimize this expression, we can use the method of setting the derivative with respect to \(a\) and \(y\) to zero. However, a simpler approach is to use the AM-GM inequality. Let \(a = y\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
8\left(\frac{2a}{a} + 5 + \frac{6a}{a} + \frac{2a^2}{a^2}\right) = 8(2 + 5 + 6 + 2) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we only consider the interval \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Since \(x^4 \geq 0\) and \(4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative and its minimum value is 0, which occurs when \(x = 0\). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.\]","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"To determine the number of possible values for \( x \) given that the total number of cards is 54, each player receives at least 5 cards, and there are at least 2 players, we can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \):**
   Since the total number of cards is 54 and each of the \( x \) players receives \( y \) cards, we have:
   \[
   x \cdot y = 54
   \]

2. **Find the possible values for \( y \):**
   Given that \( y \geq 5 \), we need to find the factors of 54 that are at least 5. First, list the factors of 54:

   The factors of 54 that are at least 5 are:
   \[
   6, 9, 18, 27, 54
   \]

3. **Determine the corresponding values for \( x \):**
   For each value of \( y \), calculate the corresponding value of \( x \) using the equation \( x = \frac{54}{y} \):
   - If \( y = 6 \), then \( x = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \).
   - If \( y = 9 \), then \( x = \frac{54}{9} = 6 \).
   - If \( y = 18 \), then \( x = \frac{54}{18} = 3 \).
   - If \( y = 27 \), then \( x = \frac{54}{27} = 2 \).
   - If \( y = 54 \), then \( x = \frac{54}{54} = 1 \).

4. **Select the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( x \geq 2 \):**
   From the above calculations, the values of \( x \) are 9, 6, 3, 2, and 1. Since \( x \geq 2 \), we exclude \( x = 1 \). The valid values of \( x \) are:
   \[

"To determine the type of conic section represented by the equation \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\), we will analyze the given equation step by step.

1. **Identify the form of the equation:**
   The given equation is \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\).

2. **Compare with the standard form of a circle:**
   The standard form of a circle is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

3. **Rewrite the given equation to match the standard form:**
   The given equation is \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\). To match the standard form, we need to rewrite \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2\) as \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)\right)^2\).
   \[
   \left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}(x - 6)^2
   \]
   So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}(x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 10
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply every term by 4:
   \[
   (x - 6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40

   Divide every term by 40 to get the equation in standard form:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.
\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(xy + yz + zx\) and \(x + y + z\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[
-8 = (x + y + z)((x + y + z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.
\]
Given that this expression equals 12, we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),

\[
sp = 24.

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:

\[

The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) of a line passing through two points \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\ y_2 - y_1 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \), we get:
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}

We need to find a vector that is parallel to \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\) and has the form \(\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix}\). Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, there exists a scalar \( k \) such that:

"To find the length of the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the parabola \(x^2 = 8y\) with one vertex at the vertex of the parabola, we start by noting that the vertex of the parabola is at the origin \((0,0)\).

Let the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\). Since these points lie on the parabola, we have:
\[x_1^2 = 8y_1 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2^2 = 8y_2.\]

The distance from the origin to each of these points is the same, and the angle between the vectors from the origin to these points is \(120^\circ\) (since the triangle is equilateral). Therefore, we can express \(x_2\) and \(y_2\) in terms of \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) as follows:
\[x_2 = x_1 \cos 120^\circ - y_1 \sin 120^\circ = -\frac{x_1}{2} - \frac{y_1 \sqrt{3}}{2},\]
\[y_2 = x_1 \sin 120^\circ + y_1 \cos 120^\circ = \frac{x_1 \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{y_1}{2}.\]

Since \((x_2, y_2)\) also lies on the parabola, we substitute \(x_2\) and \(y_2\) into the equation \(x^2 = 8y\):
\[\left(-\frac{x_1}{2} - \frac{y_1 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 8\left(\frac{x_1 \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{y_1}{2}\right).\]

Expanding and simplifying the left side, we get:
\[\frac{x_1^2}{4} + \frac{x_1 y_1 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3y_1^2}{4}.\]

Expanding and simplifying the right side, we get:
\[4x_1 \sqrt{3} - 4y_1.\]

Equating the two sides, we have:
\[\frac{x_1^2}{4} + \frac{x_1 y_1 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3y_1^2}{4} = 4x_1 \sqrt{3} - 4y_1.\]

Since \(x_1^2 = 8y_1\), we substitute \(y_1 = \frac{x_1^2}{8}\) into the equation:
\[\frac{x_1^2}{4} + \frac{x_1 \cdot \frac{x_1^2}{8} \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3 \left(\frac{x_1^2}{8}\right)^2}{4} = 4x_1 \sqrt{3} - 4 \left(\frac{x_1^2}{8}\right).\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{x_1^2}{4} + \frac{x_1^3 \sqrt{3}}{16} + \frac{3x_1^4}{256} = 4x_1 \sqrt{3} - \frac{x_1^2}{2}.\]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[\frac{3x_1^2}{4} + \frac{x_1^3 \sqrt{3}}{16} + \frac{3x_1^4}{256} = 4x_1 \sqrt{3}.\]

To find a non-trivial solution, we can test \(x_1 = 4\sqrt{3}\). Substituting \(x_1 = 4\sqrt{3}\) into \(y_1 = \frac{x_1^2}{8}\), we get:
\[y_1 = \frac{(4\sqrt{3})^2}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6.\]

Thus, the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle are \((4\sqrt{3}, 6)\) and \((-2\sqrt{3}, 6)\). The distance between the origin and \((4\sqrt{3}, 6)\) is:
\[\sqrt{(4\sqrt{3})^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{48 + 36} = \sqrt{84} = 2\sqrt{21}.\]

Solving these, we get:

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), we have:

Substituting these into the circle's equation, we get:

First, recall the relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers:
\[
\gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \cdot b.

Substituting the given values, we get:
\[

Since \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\), we can write \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\) where \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation \(a \cdot b = 210^4\), we get:

Each divisor \(m\) of \(210^2\) corresponds to a unique divisor \(n = \frac{210^2}{m}\) such that \(m \cdot n = 210^2\). Since \(a < b\), we have \(210m < 210n \implies m < n\).

The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) odd numbers is given by the formula:

"To find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \), we need to determine the value of \( f^{-1}(6) \) first, and then find the value of \( f^{-1} \) at that result.

Given:
- \( f(1) = 2 \)
- \( f(2) = 6 \)
- \( f(3) = 5 \)

From these, we can deduce the values of the inverse function \( f^{-1} \):
- Since \( f(2) = 6 \), it follows that \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).
- Since \( f(1) = 2 \), it follows that \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \).
- Since \( f(3) = 5 \), it follows that \( f^{-1}(5) = 3 \).

Now, we need to find \( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) \). We already know that \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \). Therefore, we need to find \( f^{-1}(2) \).

"To find the maximum possible perimeter of a triangle with two sides of length 8 units and a third side of integer length, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Let's denote the length of the third side by \( x \). According to the triangle inequality theorem, we have the following three conditions:

1. \( 8 + 8 > x \)
2. \( 8 + x > 8 \)
3. \( 8 + x > 8 \)

The second and third inequalities simplify to \( x > 0 \), which is always true since \( x \) is a positive integer. Therefore, the only relevant inequality is the first one:

\[ 8 + 8 > x \]
\[ 16 > x \]
\[ x < 16 \]

Additionally, the third side must be greater than the difference between the other two sides:

\[ x > 8 - 8 \]
\[ x > 0 \]

So, the possible values for \( x \) are integers from 1 to 15. To maximize the perimeter of the triangle, we should choose the largest possible value for \( x \), which is 15.

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the triangle:

"To find the area of the trapezoid, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:

\[

where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid.

From the diagram, we can identify the following:
- The length of the top base \( b_1 \) is 5 cm.
- The length of the bottom base \( b_2 \) is 9 cm.
- The height \( h \) is 5 cm.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we add the lengths of the two bases:

\[
5 + 9 = 14

Next, we multiply by the height and then by \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[

"To find the maximum value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) given that \( |ax^2 + bx + c| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), we start by considering the polynomial at specific points in the interval \([0, 1]\). Let's evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 0 \), \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( x = 1 \).

1. At \( x = 0 \), we have \( |c| \le 1 \).
2. At \( x = 1 \), we have \( |a + b + c| \le 1 \).
3. At \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), we have \( \left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \right| \le 1 \).

We need to find a polynomial that satisfies these conditions and maximizes \( |a| + |b| + |c| \). Let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \). We check the values of this polynomial at the points \( x = 0 \), \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( x = 1 \):

- At \( x = 0 \), \( P(0) = 1 \).
- At \( x = 1 \), \( P(1) = 1 \).
- At \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), \( P\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1 \).

Thus, \( |P(x)| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \). For this polynomial, \( a = 8 \), \( b = -8 \), and \( c = 1 \). Therefore, \( |a| + |b| + |c| = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \).

To confirm that 17 is indeed the maximum, we need to show that no other polynomial can achieve a higher value for \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) while satisfying the given condition.

First, we calculate the denominator:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

2. **Determine the sum of the positive divisors of 500.**
3. **Identify the distinct prime factors of the sum of the divisors.**
4. **Calculate the sum of these distinct prime factors.**

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 500
The number 500 can be factored as follows:
\[ 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \]

### Step 2: Determine the sum of the positive divisors of 500
The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is given by:

For \( 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \), the sum of the divisors is:

\[ 1092 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13 \]
The distinct prime factors of 1092 are 2, 3, 7, and 13.

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of these distinct prime factors
The sum of the distinct prime factors is:

1. **Express the coordinates of \( P \) in terms of a single variable:**
   Since \( P \) lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \), we can write the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, -x + 6) \).

2. **Calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( A \):**
   The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

3. **Calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( O \):**
   The distance from \( P(x, -x + 6) \) to \( O(0, 0) \) is:

4. **Set the distances equal to each other and solve for \( x \):**
   Since \( PA = PO \), we have:
   \[
   \sqrt{2x^2 - 52x + 356} = \sqrt{2x^2 - 12x + 36}
   \]
   Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

   2x^2 - 52x + 356 = 2x^2 - 12x + 36

   Subtract \( 2x^2 \) from both sides:

So, the expression becomes \(4\$ = \underbrace{24^{24^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{24}}}}}}_{24}\). To find the last digit of this number, we need to focus on the last digit of the base and the exponent. The last digit of 24 is 4, so we need to determine the last digit of \(\underbrace{4^{24^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{24}}}}}}_{24}\).

Next, we analyze the pattern in the last digits of the powers of 4:

\[
4^1 = 4 \quad \text{(last digit is 4)}

\[

\[

\[

From the pattern, we know that the last digit of \(4^n\) is 6 if \(n\) is even. Therefore, the last digit of \(4^{24^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{24}}}}}\) is 6.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the probability that there exists a triangle with sides of lengths 1, \(x\), and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are randomly chosen from the interval \((0,3)\), we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. \(x + y > 1\)
2. \(x + 1 > y\) or \(x > y - 1\)
3. \(y + 1 > x\) or \(y > x - 1\)

We can visualize these conditions on the coordinate plane where \(x\) and \(y\) are the axes, and both range from 0 to 3. The total area of the region where \(x\) and \(y\) can lie is a square with side length 3, so the area is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

Now, let's plot the inequalities on this square:

1. The inequality \(x + y > 1\) represents the region above the line \(y = 1 - x\).
2. The inequality \(x > y - 1\) represents the region above the line \(y = x + 1\).
3. The inequality \(y > x - 1\) represents the region above the line \(y = x - 1\).

The intersection of these regions forms a smaller hexagon within the square. To find the area of this hexagon, we first identify the vertices of the hexagon. The vertices are the points where the lines intersect the boundaries of the square:

- The line \(y = 1 - x\) intersects the square at \((0,1)\) and \((1,0)\).
- The line \(y = x + 1\) intersects the square at \((0,1)\) and \((2,3)\).
- The line \(y = x - 1\) intersects the square at \((1,0)\) and \((3,2)\).

The hexagon can be divided into two congruent right triangles and a rectangle. The right triangles each have legs of length 1, so their area is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}\). The rectangle has a length of 2 and a width of 1, so its area is \(2 \times 1 = 2\).

Therefore, the total area of the hexagon is \(2 \times \frac{1}{2} + 2 = 3\).

The probability that there exists a triangle with sides of lengths 1, \(x\), and \(y\) is the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of the square:

"To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\), we first need to rewrite it in standard quadratic form. We do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the inequality:

\[x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\]
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\]

Next, we need to factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-14\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(2\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as follows:

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0\]

To determine where the product \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) is less than or equal to zero, we need to find the roots of the equation \((x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\). The roots are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, \infty)\).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the product is non-positive. Let's test the point \(x = -3\) from the interval \((-\infty, -2)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10 > 0\]

So, the product is positive in the interval \((-\infty, -2)\).

Next, let's test the point \(x = 0\) from the interval \((-2, 7)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 < 0\]

So, the product is negative in the interval \((-2, 7)\).

Finally, let's test the point \(x = 8\) from the interval \((7, \infty)\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0\]

So, the product is positive in the interval \((7, \infty)\).

We also need to check the values at the roots \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\):

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-2 - 7)(-2 + 2) = (-9)(0) = 0\]
\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (7 - 7)(7 + 2) = (0)(9) = 0\]

So, the product is zero at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\).

Therefore, the product \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) is less than or equal to zero in the interval \([-2, 7]\). In interval notation, this is written as:

"To determine how many integers lie within the set of solutions to the inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by solving the inequality step by step.

The inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \) means that the distance between \( x \) and 2 is at most 5.6. This can be rewritten as:
\[
-5.6 \leq x-2 \leq 5.6
\]
Next, we isolate \( x \) by adding 2 to all parts of the inequality:
\[
-5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2
\]
Simplifying the left and right sides, we get:
\[
-3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6

Since \( x \) must be an integer, we consider the integers in the interval \([-3.6, 7.6]\). These integers are:
\[

\]
To find the number of these integers, we can count them directly or use the formula for the number of integers in a range. The number of integers from \( a \) to \( b \) inclusive is \( b - a + 1 \). Here, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 7 \), so the number of integers is:
\[

1. Start with the function:
   \[
   f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4

2. Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4

3. Calculate \( (-2)^2 \):
   \[
   (-2)^2 = 4

   So the expression becomes:
   \[

4. Multiply \( 5 \) by \( 4 \):

"To find the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of the function \( g(x) = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:

\[
(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \geq 0
\]

First, we expand both squares:

\[
(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9

\[
(x-8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64

Next, we substitute these expanded forms back into the inequality:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is \(2\).

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) between the origin and this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[

\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since \( x = -3 \) is the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron and the given distances from a point \( P \) to five of its vertices. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \), where \( A, C, E \) are on one face and \( B, D, F \) are on the opposite face. The edges of the octahedron are all of equal length, say \( s \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the distances as follows:
\[ PA = a, PB = b, PC = c, PD = d, PE = e, PF = f \]
where \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) are the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) respectively. Without loss of generality, let's assume:
\[ a = 3, b = 7, c = 8, d = 9, e = 11 \]
We need to find \( f \).

Using the property of the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant and equal to \( 3s^2 + 3d^2 \), where \( d \) is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices on one face and the opposite vertex is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other four vertices on the opposite face and the opposite vertex.

Let's consider the face \( A, C, E \) and the opposite face \( B, D, F \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices on one face and the opposite vertex is:
\[ a^2 + c^2 + e^2 + f^2 = b^2 + d^2 + f^2 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 3^2 + 8^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 7^2 + 9^2 + f^2 \]
Simplifying both sides:
\[ 9 + 64 + 121 + f^2 = 49 + 81 + f^2 \]
\[ 194 + f^2 = 130 + f^2 \]
Subtracting \( f^2 \) from both sides:
\[ 194 = 130 \]
This is a contradiction, so we need to consider the correct face and vertex. Let's consider the face \( A, C, E \) and the opposite vertex \( D \):
\[ a^2 + c^2 + e^2 + d^2 = b^2 + f^2 + d^2 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 3^2 + 8^2 + 11^2 + 9^2 = 7^2 + f^2 + 9^2 \]
Simplifying both sides:
\[ 9 + 64 + 121 + 81 = 49 + f^2 + 81 \]
\[ 275 = 130 + f^2 \]
Subtracting 130 from both sides:
\[ 145 = f^2 \]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ f = \sqrt{145} \]

"To solve the problem, we start with the formula for force in physics, which states that force equals mass multiplied by acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force,
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( a \) is the acceleration.

In this problem, Jen and Jack are applying the same force to their respective balls. Therefore, the force \( F \) is the same for both balls. Let's denote the mass of Jen's ball as \( m_J \) and the mass of Jack's ball as \( m_A \). Similarly, let's denote the acceleration of Jen's ball as \( a_J \) and the acceleration of Jack's ball as \( a_A \).

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can write:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_A \cdot a_A \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- The mass of Jen's ball \( m_J \) is 200 g.
- The mass of Jack's ball \( m_A \) is 150 g.

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to the acceleration of Jack's ball, which is \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \). Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_A \]

To isolate \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \), we divide both sides of the equation by 150:

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot a_J = a_A \]

Next, we divide both sides by \( a_A \):

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot \frac{a_J}{a_A} = 1 \]

Then, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{200}{150} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_A} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction \( \frac{150}{200} \) by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the function \( z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y \) and determine the optimal strategy for Archimedes and Brahmagupta. Archimedes wants to minimize \( z \) while Brahmagupta wants to maximize \( z \). We will first express \( z \) in a form that allows us to see how \( z \) depends on \( x \) and \( y \).

First, let's rewrite the function:
\[ z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y. \]

We can expand the squared term:
\[ z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 2y^2 - 3y = 4x^2 - 4xy - y^2 - 3y. \]

Now, we need to consider the optimal strategy for Brahmagupta. For a fixed \( x \), Brahmagupta will choose \( y \) to maximize \( z \). To find the maximum value of \( z \) with respect to \( y \), we take the partial derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( y \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -4x - 2y - 3. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ -4x - 2y - 3 = 0 \implies y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}. \]

We substitute \( y = -2x - \frac{3}{2} \) back into the function \( z \):
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 - 4x\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) - \left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 3\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right). \]

Simplify the expression step by step:
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x - \left(4x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}\right) + 6x + \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x - 4x^2 - 6x - \frac{9}{4} + 6x + \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}. \]

Now, we need to minimize the function \( 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4} \). This is a quadratic function in \( x \) that opens upwards, so its minimum value occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 6 \), so:
\[ x = -\frac{6}{2 \cdot 8} = -\frac{6}{16} = -\frac{3}{8}. \]

"To determine the area of the gray region in the given tangram puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the side length of the square \(ABCD\):**
   The area of the square \(ABCD\) is given as 16 square inches. Since the area of a square is the side length squared, we have:
   \[
   s^2 = 16 \implies s = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the side length of the square is 4 inches.

2. **Identify the area of the mảnh ""e"":**
   The mảnh ""e"" is a smaller square within the tangram. In a standard tangram, the smaller square ""e"" has an area that is \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the area of the entire square. Therefore, the area of the mảnh ""e"" is:

   The gray region is a right triangle with its right angle at the center of the square and its legs along the diagonals of the square. The legs of this triangle are each equal to the side length of the smaller square ""e"", which is \(\sqrt{2}\) inches (since the area of a square is the side length squared, and the side length of the smaller square is \(\sqrt{2}\) inches).

   The area of a right triangle is given by:

"To determine who will earn the most after working a day of eight hours, we need to calculate the hourly wage in US dollars for each person and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

First, let's convert the hourly wages from their respective currencies to US dollars.

1. **Navin's hourly wage:**
   - Navin earns 160 rupees per hour.
   - 1 US dollar is equivalent to 32.35 rupees.
   - Therefore, Navin's hourly wage in US dollars is:
     \[
     \frac{160 \text{ rupees}}{32.35 \text{ rupees/US dollar}} \approx 4.95 \text{ US dollars/hour}
     \]

2. **Luka's hourly wage:**
   - Luka earns 25 kuna per hour.
   - 1 US dollar is equivalent to 5.18 kuna.
   - Therefore, Luka's hourly wage in US dollars is:
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ kuna}}{5.18 \text{ kuna/US dollar}} \approx 4.83 \text{ US dollars/hour}
     \]

3. **Ian's hourly wage:**
   - Ian earns 34 pula per hour.
   - 1 US dollar is equivalent to 6.95 pula.
   - Therefore, Ian's hourly wage in US dollars is:
     \[
     \frac{34 \text{ pula}}{6.95 \text{ pula/US dollar}} \approx 4.90 \text{ US dollars/hour}
     \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each person after working a day of eight hours.

1. **Navin's total earnings:**
   \[
   4.95 \text{ US dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 39.60 \text{ US dollars}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the smaller semicircle that is tangent to the larger semicircle and the radii \(AQ\) and \(BQ\) of the larger circle. The larger circle has a radius of 14 inches, and the angle between the radii \(AQ\) and \(BQ\) is 90 degrees.

First, let's denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as \(r\). The center of the smaller semicircle will be at a distance of \(r\) from the line segment \(AB\) and at a distance of \(14 - r\) from the center \(Q\) of the larger circle.

Since the smaller semicircle is tangent to the larger semicircle and the radii \(AQ\) and \(BQ\), the distance from the center of the smaller semicircle to the center \(Q\) of the larger circle is equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller semicircle, which is \(14 - r\).

The center of the smaller semicircle is also at a distance of \(r\) from the line segment \(AB\), which is the same as the radius of the smaller semicircle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the smaller semicircle to the center \(Q\) of the larger circle can also be expressed as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length \(r\) and \(r\). This hypotenuse is \(r\sqrt{2}\).

Setting these two expressions for the distance equal to each other, we get:
\[
r\sqrt{2} = 14 - r
\]

To solve for \(r\), we first isolate \(r\) on one side of the equation:
\[
r\sqrt{2} + r = 14
\]
\[
r(\sqrt{2} + 1) = 14
\]
\[
r = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2} + 1}

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1} = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)

Thus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( |z| = 1 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 1 \), we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \).

Now, we need to evaluate \( |1 + z| \) and \( |1 - z + z^2| \).

1. **Calculate \( |1 + z| \):**
   \[
   1 + z = 1 + \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
   \]
   The magnitude is:
   \[
   |1 + z| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 + 2\cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos \theta} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos \theta)} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 2 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} = 2 \left| \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right|
   \]

2. **Calculate \( |1 - z + z^2| \):**
   \[
   z^2 = e^{2i\theta} = \cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta
   \]
   So,
   \[
   1 - z + z^2 = 1 - \cos \theta - i \sin \theta + \cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta = (1 - \cos \theta + \cos 2\theta) + i (\sin 2\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]
   The magnitude is:
   \[
   |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(1 - \cos \theta + \cos 2\theta)^2 + (\sin 2\theta - \sin \theta)^2}
   \]
   Using the double-angle identities \( \cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - 1 \) and \( \sin 2\theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta \), we get:
   \[
   1 - \cos \theta + \cos 2\theta = 1 - \cos \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta = \cos \theta (2\cos \theta - 1)
   \]
   \[
   \sin 2\theta - \sin \theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta - \sin \theta = \sin \theta (2\cos \theta - 1)
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(\cos \theta (2\cos \theta - 1))^2 + (\sin \theta (2\cos \theta - 1))^2} = \sqrt{(2\cos \theta - 1)^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta)} = \sqrt{(2\cos \theta - 1)^2} = |2\cos \theta - 1|
   \]

Now, we need to maximize the expression:
\[
|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 2 \left| \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right| + |2\cos \theta - 1|
\]

Let \( x = \cos \theta \). Since \( \cos \theta = 2\cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) - 1 \), we have \( \left| \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right| = \sqrt{\frac{1 + x}{2}} \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
2 \sqrt{\frac{1 + x}{2}} + |2x - 1| = \sqrt{2(1 + x)} + |2x - 1|
\]

We need to maximize this function for \( -1 \leq x \leq 1 \).

- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( |2x - 1| = 2x - 1 \), so the expression is:
  \[
  \sqrt{2(1 + x)} + 2x - 1
  \]
  Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 + x)}} + 2 = 0 \quad \text{(no real solution)}
  \]
  Evaluating at the endpoints \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( x = 1 \):
  \[
  \sqrt{2(1 + \frac{1}{2})} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 1 = \sqrt{3} \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{2(1 + 1)} + 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 2\sqrt{2} + 1
  \]
  Since \( 2\sqrt{2} + 1 > \sqrt{3} \), the maximum value in this interval is \( 2\sqrt{2} + 1 \).

- For \( x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( |2x - 1| = 1 - 2x \), so the expression is:
  \[
  \sqrt{2(1 + x)} + 1 - 2x
  \]
  Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 + x)}} - 2 = 0 \implies \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 + x)}} = 2 \implies \sqrt{2(1 + x)} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 2(1 + x) = \frac{1}{4} \implies 1 + x = \frac{1}{8} \implies x = -\frac{7}{8}
  \]
  Evaluating at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = -\frac{7}{8} \):
  \[
  \sqrt{2(1 - 1)} + 1 - 2(-1) = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{2(1 - \frac{7}{8})} + 1 - 2(-\frac{7}{8}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} + 1 + \frac{7}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{7}{4} = \frac{15}{4} = 3.75
  \]
  Since \( 3.75 > 3 \), the maximum value in this interval is \( 3.75 \).

Comparing the maximum values from both intervals, the overall maximum value is \( 3.75 \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) is \(\boxed{\frac{15}{4}}\).","[15/4, '\\frac{15}{4}']",\frac{13}{4},"[13/4, '\\frac{13}{4}']",False
"To find the result of a $90^\circ$ clockwise rotation of the complex number $3$ around the point $-4 - 5i$, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate the complex number**: First, we need to translate the complex number $3$ so that the point of rotation $-4 - 5i$ becomes the origin. This is done by subtracting $-4 - 5i$ from $3$.

   \[
   z = 3 - (-4 - 5i) = 3 + 4 + 5i = 7 + 5i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number**: A $90^\circ$ clockwise rotation of a complex number $a + bi$ is equivalent to multiplying it by $-i$. Therefore, we need to compute:

   \[
   (7 + 5i) \cdot (-i)
   \]

   We can expand this multiplication:

   \[
   (7 + 5i) \cdot (-i) = 7(-i) + 5i(-i) = -7i - 5i^2
   \]

   Since $i^2 = -1$, we have:

   \[
   -5i^2 = -5(-1) = 5
   \]

   Thus, the expression simplifies to:

   \[
   -7i + 5 = 5 - 7i

3. **Translate back**: Now we need to translate the result back by adding $-4 - 5i$:

   \[
   (5 - 7i) + (-4 - 5i) = 5 - 4 - 7i - 5i = 1 - 12i

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

Let's start with the given information:
- Total number of boxes: \(10\)
- Number of boxes that contain pens: \(5\)
- Number of boxes that contain pencils: \(4\)
- Number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils: \(2\)

The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the original vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and its image \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the midpoint of the segment joining \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+4}{2}, \frac{0+3}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{9}{2}, \frac{3}{2} \right).

Next, we find the slope of the line passing through \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\):
\[
\text{Slope} = \frac{3-0}{4-5} = -3.

So, the line of reflection is \(y = \frac{1}{3}x\).

Now, we need to find the reflection of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) across the line \(y = \frac{1}{3}x\). The formula for the reflection of a vector \(\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) across the line \(y = mx\) is:

"To find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola, we start by determining the equation of the hyperbola given its asymptotes and a point it passes through.

The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by the equations \( y = 2x - 3 \) and \( y = 17 - 2x \). The equations of the asymptotes can be rewritten as:
\[ y - 2x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ y + 2x - 17 = 0 \]

The equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form:
\[ (y - 2x + 3)(y + 2x - 17) = k \]
where \( k \) is a constant. To find \( k \), we substitute the coordinates of the point \( (4,7) \) into the equation:
\[ (7 - 2(4) + 3)(7 + 2(4) - 17) = k \]
\[ (7 - 8 + 3)(7 + 8 - 17) = k \]
\[ 2 \cdot (-2) = k \]
\[ k = -4 \]

Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:
\[ (y - 2x + 3)(y + 2x - 17) = -4 \]

Next, we expand and rewrite the equation in the standard form of a hyperbola. First, expand the left-hand side:
\[ y^2 + 2xy - 17y - 2xy - 4x^2 + 34x + 3y + 6x - 51 = -4 \]
\[ y^2 - 4x^2 - 14y + 40x - 51 = -4 \]
\[ y^2 - 4x^2 - 14y + 40x - 47 = 0 \]

To rewrite this in the standard form, we complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ y^2 - 14y - 4x^2 + 40x = 47 \]
\[ (y^2 - 14y + 49) - 49 - 4(x^2 - 10x + 25) + 100 = 47 \]
\[ (y - 7)^2 - 4(x - 5)^2 + 51 = 47 \]
\[ (y - 7)^2 - 4(x - 5)^2 = -4 \]
\[ 4(x - 5)^2 - (y - 7)^2 = 4 \]
\[ \frac{(x - 5)^2}{1} - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = 1 \]

This is the standard form of a hyperbola \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\), where \(a^2 = 1\) and \(b^2 = 4\). The distance between the foci of a hyperbola is given by \(2c\), where \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore:
\[ c = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]
\[ 2c = 2\sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the value of \( N \) such that the number \( 21420N \) is divisible by 6, we need to check the divisibility rules for both 2 and 3, since a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Therefore, \( N \) must be one of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.**
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \( 21420N \) is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N. \]
We need \( 9 + N \) to be divisible by 3. Since 9 is already divisible by 3, \( N \) must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, \( N \) must be one of the digits 0, 3, 6, or 9.

**Step 3: Find the common values of \( N \) that satisfy both conditions.**
From the two sets of possible values for \( N \) (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and (0, 3, 6, 9), the common values are 0 and 6.

**Step 4: Exclude the value \( N = 0 \).**
The problem asks for the value of \( N \) that is not zero. Therefore, the only possible value for \( N \) is 6.

"Given the polynomial \( P(x) \) of degree 2 with real coefficients, we know that it satisfies the inequality \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \) for all real \( x \). We also know that \( P(11) = 181 \).

First, let's express \( P(x) \) in the general form:
\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. \]

We need to find the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Since \( P(x) \) is bounded by the quadratic polynomials \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \) and \( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \), we can consider the polynomial \( Q(x) = P(x) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) \). This polynomial must satisfy:
\[ 0 \le Q(x) \le x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2. \]
Similarly, the polynomial \( R(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - P(x) \) must satisfy:
\[ 0 \le R(x) \le x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2. \]

Since \( Q(x) \) and \( R(x) \) are both non-negative and bounded by \( (x-1)^2 \), they must have a double root at \( x = 1 \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ Q(x) = k(x-1)^2 \]
and
\[ R(x) = m(x-1)^2, \]
for some constants \( k \) and \( m \) such that \( 0 \le k, m \le 1 \).

This implies:
\[ P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 + k(x-1)^2. \]

We know that \( P(11) = 181 \), so we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the equation:
\[ P(11) = 11^2 - 2 \cdot 11 + 2 + k(11-1)^2 = 121 - 22 + 2 + 100k = 101 + 100k. \]
Since \( P(11) = 181 \), we have:
\[ 101 + 100k = 181 \implies 100k = 80 \implies k = 0.8. \]

Thus, the polynomial \( P(x) \) is:
\[ P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 + 0.8(x-1)^2. \]

We expand and simplify this expression:
\[ P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 + 0.8(x^2 - 2x + 1) = x^2 - 2x + 2 + 0.8x^2 - 1.6x + 0.8 = 1.8x^2 - 3.6x + 2.8. \]

Now, we need to find \( P(16) \):
\[ P(16) = 1.8 \cdot 16^2 - 3.6 \cdot 16 + 2.8 = 1.8 \cdot 256 - 57.6 + 2.8 = 460.8 - 57.6 + 2.8 = 406. \]

"To solve the equation \((3)5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Isolate the term involving \(a\).
3. Solve for \(a\).

Let's start with the equation:
\[
(3)5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

First, calculate \(5^2\):
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Now, multiply by 3:
\[
(3)25 = 75
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
75 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

Next, isolate the term involving \(a\). Subtract 75 from both sides:
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63 - 75
\]
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = -12
\]

Now, eliminate the negative signs by multiplying both sides by -1:
\[
4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 12
\]

Next, eliminate the division by 3 by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
4(5-a)^2 = 36
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[
(5-a)^2 = 9
\]

To solve for \(a\), take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:
\[
5-a = \pm 3
\]

This gives us two equations to solve:
1. \(5-a = 3\)
2. \(5-a = -3\)

Solve the first equation:
\[
5-a = 3
\]
\[
-a = 3-5
\]
\[
-a = -2
\]
\[
a = 2
\]

Solve the second equation:
\[
5-a = -3
\]
\[
-a = -3-5
\]
\[
-a = -8
\]
\[
a = 8
\]

The solutions to the equation are \(a = 2\) and \(a = 8\). To find the sum of these values, add them together:
\[

"To find the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we first reduce the bases modulo 11.

First, we reduce 129 modulo 11:
\[129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[129 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Next, we reduce 96 modulo 11:
\[96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[96 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, the expression \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) becomes \(8^{34} + 8^{38} \pmod{11}\).

We can factor out \(8^{34}\) from the expression:
\[8^{34} + 8^{38} = 8^{34}(1 + 8^4).\]

Next, we need to find \(8^4 \pmod{11}\):
\[8^2 = 64,\]
\[64 \div 11 = 5 \text{ remainder } 9,\]
so
\[8^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{11},\]
\[8^4 = (8^2)^2 \equiv 9^2 = 81 \pmod{11},\]
\[81 \div 11 = 7 \text{ remainder } 4,\]
so
\[8^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

Therefore,
\[1 + 8^4 \equiv 1 + 4 = 5 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, we need to find \(8^{34} \pmod{11}\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that \(8^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). We can write \(8^{34}\) as:
\[8^{34} = 8^{30} \cdot 8^4 = (8^{10})^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 8^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

So,
\[8^{34}(1 + 8^4) \equiv 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \pmod{11},\]
\[20 \div 11 = 1 \text{ remainder } 9,\]
so
\[20 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}.\]

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:

\[

\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we start by letting \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\) is given by

\[

Setting this equal to \(\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}\), we get the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
2z + 5y = 90, \\
-5x - z = 30, \\
x - 2y = 30.

\]

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the third equation for \(x\):

\[
x = 2y + 30.
\]

Next, substitute \(x = 2y + 30\) into the second equation:

\[
-5(2y + 30) - z = 30 \implies -10y - 150 - z = 30 \implies -10y - z = 180 \implies z = -10y - 180.
\]

Now substitute \(z = -10y - 180\) into the first equation:

\[
2(-10y - 180) + 5y = 90 \implies -20y - 360 + 5y = 90 \implies -15y - 360 = 90 \implies -15y = 450 \implies y = -30.
\]

Now substitute \(y = -30\) back into the expressions for \(x\) and \(z\):

\[
x = 2(-30) + 30 = -60 + 30 = -30,
\]
\[
z = -10(-30) - 180 = 300 - 180 = 120.
\]

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix}\). To find the vector with the smallest magnitude, we note that any vector \(\mathbf{v}\) that satisfies the original equation can be written as \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix} + \mathbf{u}\), where \(\mathbf{u}\) is any vector in the direction of \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -30 \\ -30 \\ 120 \end{pmatrix}\) is already orthogonal to \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\), so it has the smallest magnitude.

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}\) is

\[

This gives us the equation \(\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi\). Since \(\gamma = \pi - \alpha - \beta\), we can use the cosine function to express \(\cos \gamma\) in terms of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\):

\[
\cos \gamma = \cos(\pi - \alpha - \beta) = -\cos(\alpha + \beta).
\]

Given that \(\gamma = \arccos 3x\), we have \(\cos \gamma = 3x\). Therefore,

\[
3x = -\cos(\alpha + \beta).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get

\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta.
\]

Since \(\cos \alpha = x\) and \(\cos \beta = 2x\), we need to find \(\sin \alpha\) and \(\sin \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have

\[
\sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = \sqrt{1 - (2x)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}.
\]

Substituting these into the cosine addition formula, we get

\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = x \cdot 2x - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 4x^2} = 2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.

Thus, the equation becomes

\[
3x = -\left(2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}\right) = -2x^2 + \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have

\[
\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)} = 3x + 2x^2.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2) = (3x + 2x^2)^2.

Expanding both sides, we have

\[
1 - 4x^2 - x^2 + 4x^4 = 9x^2 + 12x^3 + 4x^4,

which simplifies to

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^3\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^3\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^3\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^3 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_3^3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^3.
\]
Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression to:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2(-2) = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4 = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i,\) and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\).

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\boxed{\{2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i, -1 - \sqrt{3}i\}}\).","[{2, -sqrt(3)*i - 1, sqrt(3)*i - 1}, '\\{2, -1 + \\sqrt{3}i, -1 - \\sqrt{3}i\\}']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"To find the largest integer less than \(2010\) that leaves a remainder of \(5\) when divided by \(7\), a remainder of \(10\) when divided by \(11\), and a remainder of \(10\) when divided by \(13\), we can set up the following system of congruences:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}
\end{cases}
\]

First, we note that the last two congruences can be combined since they both have the same remainder:

\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{\text{lcm}(11, 13)}
\]

The least common multiple of \(11\) and \(13\) is \(143\) (since \(11\) and \(13\) are both prime). Therefore, we have:

\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\]

This means that \(x\) can be written in the form:

\[
x = 143k + 10
\]

for some integer \(k\). We now substitute this into the first congruence:

\[
143k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

We simplify \(143 \pmod{7}\):

\[
143 \div 7 = 20 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 143 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the congruence becomes:

\[
3k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

We subtract \(10\) from both sides:

\[
3k \equiv 5 - 10 \pmod{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3k \equiv -5 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(-5 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we have:

\[
3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]

To solve for \(k\), we need the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(7\). We test values to find this inverse:

\[
3 \cdot 1 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 2 = 6 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 3 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 5 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(7\) is \(5\). We multiply both sides of the congruence \(3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) by \(5\):

\[
k \equiv 2 \cdot 5 \pmod{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \equiv 10 \pmod{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

This means that \(k\) can be written in the form:

\[
k = 7m + 3
\]

for some integer \(m\). Substituting this back into the expression for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 143(7m + 3) + 10 = 1001m + 429 + 10 = 1001m + 439
\]

The largest integer less than \(2010\) occurs when \(m = 0\):

\[
x = 439
\]

Thus, the largest integer less than \(2010\) that satisfies all the given conditions is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationship between \( y \) and \( \sqrt{x} \). The problem states that the value of \( y \) changes inversely with \( \sqrt{x} \). This means that the product of \( y \) and \( \sqrt{x} \) is a constant. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ y \cdot \sqrt{x} = k \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

We are given that when \( x = 24 \), \( y = 15 \). We can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 15 \cdot \sqrt{24} = k \]

First, we simplify \( \sqrt{24} \):

\[ \sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = 2\sqrt{6} \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 15 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = k \]
\[ 30\sqrt{6} = k \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 3 \). We substitute \( y = 3 \) and \( k = 30\sqrt{6} \) back into the equation \( y \cdot \sqrt{x} = k \):

\[ 3 \cdot \sqrt{x} = 30\sqrt{6} \]

To isolate \( \sqrt{x} \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ \sqrt{x} = 10\sqrt{6} \]

Next, we square both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = (10\sqrt{6})^2 \]
\[ x = 10^2 \cdot (\sqrt{6})^2 \]
\[ x = 100 \cdot 6 \]
\[ x = 600 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by recalling some properties of the centroid \(G\), the orthocenter \(H\), and the circumcenter \(O\) of a triangle \(ABC\). The centroid \(G\) divides the line segment joining the orthocenter \(H\) and the circumcenter \(O\) in the ratio \(2:1\), i.e., \(HG = 2GO\). The point \(F\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{GH}\), so \(GF = \frac{1}{2}GH = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2GO = GO\).

We need to find the expression for \(AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2\). First, we use the fact that the distance from a vertex of a triangle to the centroid \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the median from that vertex. The median from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\) is given by:
\[
m_a = \sqrt{\frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}.
\]
Thus, the distance from \(A\) to \(G\) is:
\[
AG = \frac{2}{3} m_a = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(F\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{GH}\) and \(GO = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2}\). The distance from \(A\) to \(F\) can be found using the Apollonius's theorem in \(\triangle AGH\):
\[
AF^2 = AG^2 + GF^2 - 2 \cdot AG \cdot GF \cdot \cos \angle AGF.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(F\) is the nine-point center of the triangle, and the distance from a vertex to the nine-point center is half the distance from that vertex to the orthocenter. The distance from \(A\) to \(H\) is given by:
\[
AH = 2R \cos A.
\]
Thus, the distance from \(A\) to \(F\) is:
\[
AF = \frac{1}{2} AH = R \cos A.
\]
Using the cosine rule in \(\triangle ABC\), we have:
\[
\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
AF^2 = R^2 \cos^2 A = R^2 \left( \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \right)^2 = R^2 \frac{(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)^2}{4b^2c^2}.
\]
Similarly, we can find \(BF^2\) and \(CF^2\):
\[
BF^2 = R^2 \frac{(c^2 + a^2 - b^2)^2}{4c^2a^2}, \quad CF^2 = R^2 \frac{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2}{4a^2b^2}.
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2 = R^2 \left( \frac{(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)^2}{4b^2c^2} + \frac{(c^2 + a^2 - b^2)^2}{4c^2a^2} + \frac{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} \right).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the diagonal of a square given that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of an equilateral triangle with an area of \(16\sqrt{3}\) square cm.

First, let's determine the side length of the equilateral triangle. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
We know the area is \(16\sqrt{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 16\sqrt{3}
\]
To solve for \(s^2\), we can divide both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{s^2}{4} = 16
\]
Next, we multiply both sides by 4:
\[
s^2 = 64
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 8
\]
So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 8 cm. The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is:
\[
3s = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ cm}
\]
Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the square is also 24 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square with side length \(a\) is:
\[
4a
\]
Setting this equal to 24, we get:
\[
4a = 24
\]
Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[
a = 6
\]
So, the side length of the square is 6 cm. The diagonal \(d\) of a square with side length \(a\) is given by the formula:
\[
d = a\sqrt{2}
\]
Substituting \(a = 6\), we get:
\[
d = 6\sqrt{2}

"To determine the price of one pencil sharpener, we start by defining the variables for the prices of the pencil sharpeners and the erasers. Let \( p \) be the price of one pencil sharpener and \( e \) be the price of one eraser. According to the problem, we have the following system of linear equations:

1. \( 2e + p = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5e + p = 1.82 \)

We can eliminate \( p \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[
(5e + p) - (2e + p) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3e = 0.58
\]

Solving for \( e \), we get:

\[
e = \frac{0.58}{3} = 0.1933\ldots \approx 0.1933
\]

Now that we have the price of one eraser, we can substitute \( e = 0.1933 \) back into the first equation to find \( p \):

\[
2(0.1933) + p = 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0.3867 + p = 1.24
\]

Solving for \( p \), we get:

\[
p = 1.24 - 0.3867 = 0.8533\ldots \approx 0.8533
\]

To convert the price of one pencil sharpener to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[
p = 0.8533 \times 100 = 85.33
\]

Since the price is typically expressed in whole cents, we round to the nearest cent:

\[

Therefore, the price of one pencil sharpener is \(\boxed{85}\) cents.","[85, '85']",29,"[29, '29']",False
"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given that \(a + b + c + d = 1\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-HM (Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean) inequality in a more straightforward way. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, define the function \(f(a, b, c, d) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) and the constraint \(g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 1 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to solve the system of equations given by \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\) and \(g(a, b, c, d) = 0\).

First, compute the gradients:
\[
\nabla f = \left( -\frac{1}{a^2}, -\frac{1}{b^2}, -\frac{4}{c^2}, -\frac{16}{d^2} \right)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (1, 1, 1, 1)
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get:
\[
-\frac{1}{a^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{1}{b^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{4}{c^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{16}{d^2} = \lambda
\]

From these equations, we can express \(\lambda\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\):
\[
\lambda = -\frac{1}{a^2} = -\frac{1}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{c^2} = -\frac{16}{d^2}
\]

This gives us the relationships:
\[
a^2 = b^2, \quad a^2 = \frac{c^2}{4}, \quad a^2 = \frac{d^2}{16}
\]

From \(a^2 = b^2\), we get \(a = b\) (since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive).

From \(a^2 = \frac{c^2}{4}\), we get \(c = 2a\).

From \(a^2 = \frac{d^2}{16}\), we get \(d = 4a\).

Now substitute \(b = a\), \(c = 2a\), and \(d = 4a\) into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):
\[
a + a + 2a + 4a = 1 \implies 8a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Then, \(b = \frac{1}{8}\), \(c = 2a = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(d = 4a = \frac{1}{2}\).

Substitute these values back into the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\):
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{4}{\frac{1}{4}} + \frac{16}{\frac{1}{2}} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64

"To find the minimum value of \(a^4 + b^8\) given that \(ab^2 = 5\), we start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\). From the constraint \(ab^2 = 5\), we can solve for \(a\):

\[a = \frac{5}{b^2}.\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(a\) into the function \(a^4 + b^8\):

\[a^4 + b^8 = \left(\frac{5}{b^2}\right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.\]

Let \(x = b^8\). Then the expression becomes:

\[\frac{625}{x} + x.\]

We need to find the minimum value of the function \(f(x) = \frac{625}{x} + x\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

\[f'(x) = -\frac{625}{x^2} + 1.\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[-\frac{625}{x^2} + 1 = 0 \implies \frac{625}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 625 \implies x = 25.\]

Since \(x = b^8\) and \(b\) is a positive real number, we have \(x = 25\). To confirm that this value of \(x\) gives a minimum, we check the second derivative of \(f(x)\):

\[f''(x) = \frac{1250}{x^3}.\]

Since \(f''(x) > 0\) for \(x > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) has a local minimum at \(x = 25\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) is:

\[f(25) = \frac{625}{25} + 25 = 25 + 25 = 50.\]

Let \( y = \arcsin x \). Since \( x \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( y \) ranges from \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) can be rewritten as:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is positive because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.

The expression inside the square root is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \). We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \).

First, we factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3). \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ (x-2)(x-3) > 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \), which are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:
- For \( x \in (-\infty, 2) \), choose \( x = 1 \). Then, \( (1-2)(1-3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (-\infty, 2) \).
- For \( x \in (2, 3) \), choose \( x = 2.5 \). Then, \( (2.5-2)(2.5-3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0 \). So, the inequality does not hold in \( (2, 3) \).
- For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \). Then, \( (4-2)(4-3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( (x-2)(x-3) > 0 \) is \( x \in (-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \).

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \) is \(\boxed{(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)}\).","[Union(Interval.open(-oo, 2), Interval.open(3, oo)), '(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)']","(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)","[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of dice \( n \) such that the probability of exactly two of them showing a number other than 1 is \(\frac{25}{216}\).

First, let's define the probability of a single die showing a number other than 1. Since a die has 6 faces, the probability of showing a number other than 1 is:
\[
P(\text{not 1}) = \frac{5}{6}
\]
and the probability of showing 1 is:
\[
P(1) = \frac{1}{6}
\]

We are interested in the probability that exactly two out of \( n \) dice show a number other than 1. This is a binomial probability problem where the number of trials is \( n \), the number of successes (showing a number other than 1) is 2, the probability of success on each trial is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability of failure on each trial is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

The binomial probability formula is:
\[
P(\text{exactly } k \text{ successes}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]
where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, \( p \) is the probability of success, and \( k \) is the number of successes. For our problem, \( k = 2 \), \( p = \frac{5}{6} \), and \( 1-p = \frac{1}{6} \). Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{exactly 2 dice show a number other than 1}) = \binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2}
\]

We are given that this probability is \(\frac{25}{216}\). So, we can write:
\[
\binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2}\) is:
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]
and \(\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}\). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

Next, cancel the common factor of 25 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{216}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{2}{216}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{2}{216}\) to \(\frac{1}{108}\):
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{108}
\]

Multiply both sides by 36:
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{36}{108}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{36}{108}\) to \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
n(n-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, we need to find \( n \) such that this equation holds. Let's test some values of \( n \):

For \( n = 3 \):
\[
3(3-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{3-2} = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 1 \neq \frac{1}{3}
\]

For \( n = 4 \):
\[
4(4-1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{4-2} = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve for the value of \(\square\), we start by analyzing the given equations:

1. \(\triangle + \square = \clubsuit\)
2. \(\triangle + \triangle = \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond\)
3. \(\triangle + \triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond\)

From the second equation, we can express \(\triangle\) in terms of \(\diamond\):
\[
2\triangle = 5\diamond \implies \triangle = \frac{5}{2}\diamond
\]
Since \(\triangle\) and \(\diamond\) are integers, \(\diamond\) must be an even number. The possible values for \(\diamond\) are 2, 4, 6, and 8. However, since \(\triangle\) must be an integer between 1 and 9, we check each value of \(\diamond\):

- If \(\diamond = 2\), then \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2} \times 2 = 5\).
- If \(\diamond = 4\), then \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2} \times 4 = 10\), which is not between 1 and 9.
- If \(\diamond = 6\), then \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2} \times 6 = 15\), which is not between 1 and 9.
- If \(\diamond = 8\), then \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2} \times 8 = 20\), which is not between 1 and 9.

Therefore, the only possible value for \(\diamond\) is 2, and the corresponding value for \(\triangle\) is 5.

Next, we substitute \(\triangle = 5\) and \(\diamond = 2\) into the third equation:
\[
\triangle + \triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond \implies 5 + 5 = \clubsuit + 2 \implies 10 = \clubsuit + 2 \implies \clubsuit = 8
\]

Now we substitute \(\triangle = 5\) and \(\clubsuit = 8\) into the first equation:
\[
\triangle + \square = \clubsuit \implies 5 + \square = 8 \implies \square = 3

"To find the quotient when \(x^9 + 1\) is divided by \(x - 1\), we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Here, we will use synthetic division.

First, identify the root corresponding to the divisor \(x - 1\). The root is \(x = 1\).

Next, write down the coefficients of the polynomial \(x^9 + 1\). Since there are no \(x^8, x^7, \ldots, x\) terms, we include zeros for these coefficients. The coefficients are \(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\).

Now, set up the synthetic division with \(1\) as the divisor and the coefficients of the polynomial:

"To determine how many gallons of gas Karla would save by driving a hybrid car instead of an SUV, we need to calculate the amount of gas each type of car consumes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the amount of gas consumed by the SUV:
\[

Now, we find the difference in the amount of gas consumed between the SUV and the hybrid car:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( a = kb \).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of both diagonals, so its coordinates are \(O = \left(0, 0\right)\) if we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(B = \left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(C = \left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), and \(D = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\).

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{4}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the distances to the other vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The region where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by these inequalities. This region is a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a}{2}\) and \(\frac{b}{2}\).

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:

"To find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points of tangency of the two circles and the parabola, we start by determining the equations of the common tangents to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) and the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\).

First, consider the general form of the tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\):
\[ y = mx + c. \]
Since this line is tangent to the circle, the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle \((0,0)\) to the line must equal the radius \(\sqrt{2}\). The perpendicular distance is given by:
\[ \frac{|c|}{\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = \sqrt{2}. \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ c^2 = 2(1 + m^2). \]
Next, consider the general form of the tangent to the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\):
\[ y = mx + \frac{2}{m}. \]
For this line to be tangent to the parabola, it must satisfy the condition that the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by substituting \(y = mx + \frac{2}{m}\) into \(y^2 = 8x\) is zero. Substituting, we get:
\[ \left(mx + \frac{2}{m}\right)^2 = 8x, \]
\[ m^2x^2 + 4x + \frac{4}{m^2} = 8x, \]
\[ m^2x^2 - 4x + \frac{4}{m^2} = 0. \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
\[ (-4)^2 - 4(m^2)\left(\frac{4}{m^2}\right) = 16 - 16 = 0. \]
Thus, the line \(y = mx + \frac{2}{m}\) is tangent to the parabola for all \(m\).

Now, we equate the two expressions for \(c\):
\[ \frac{2}{m} = \sqrt{2(1 + m^2)}. \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ \frac{4}{m^2} = 2(1 + m^2), \]
\[ \frac{2}{m^2} = 1 + m^2, \]
\[ 2 = m^2 + m^4, \]
\[ m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0. \]
Let \(u = m^2\). Then the equation becomes:
\[ u^2 + u - 2 = 0, \]
\[ (u + 2)(u - 1) = 0. \]
Thus, \(u = -2\) (which is not possible since \(u = m^2 \geq 0\)) or \(u = 1\). Therefore, \(m^2 = 1\), so \(m = \pm 1\).

For \(m = 1\), the tangent line is:
\[ y = x + 2. \]
For \(m = -1\), the tangent line is:
\[ y = -x - 2. \]

Next, we find the points of tangency on the circle and the parabola. For the tangent \(y = x + 2\):
- On the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\):
  \[ x^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 2, \]
  \[ x^2 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2, \]
  \[ 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0, \]
  \[ x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, \]
  \[ (x + 1)^2 = 0, \]
  \[ x = -1. \]
  Substituting \(x = -1\) into \(y = x + 2\), we get \(y = 1\). So, the point of tangency is \((-1, 1)\).
- On the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\):
  \[ 1^2 = 8(-1), \]
  \[ 1 = -8, \]
  which is not possible. Therefore, there is no point of tangency on the parabola for the line \(y = x + 2\).

For the tangent \(y = -x - 2\):
- On the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\):
  \[ x^2 + (-x - 2)^2 = 2, \]
  \[ x^2 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2, \]
  \[ 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0, \]
  \[ x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, \]
  \[ (x + 1)^2 = 0, \]
  \[ x = -1. \]
  Substituting \(x = -1\) into \(y = -x - 2\), we get \(y = -1\). So, the point of tangency is \((-1, -1)\).
- On the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\):
  \[ (-1)^2 = 8(-1), \]
  \[ 1 = -8, \]
  which is not possible. Therefore, there is no point of tangency on the parabola for the line \(y = -x - 2\).

Thus, the points of tangency are \((-1, 1)\) and \((-1, -1)\) on the circle, and the points of tangency on the parabola are \((2, 4)\) and \((2, -4)\).

The quadrilateral formed by these points is a rectangle with vertices \((-1, 1)\), \((-1, -1)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((2, -4)\). The length of the vertical side is:
\[ 4 - (-4) = 8, \]
and the length of the horizontal side is:
\[ 2 - (-1) = 3. \]

The first term \( a \) is \(\frac{1}{4}\), and the common ratio \( r \) is \(\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}\).

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:

We are given that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \(\frac{255}{512}\), so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{255}{512} \]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{510}{512} \]

Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[ 1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{255}{256} \]

Next, we isolate \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\) by subtracting \(\frac{255}{256}\) from 1:

Since \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{256}\) and \(\frac{1}{256} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\), we have:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 \]

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). This can be rewritten as:

\[17x - 83k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(17\) and \(83\):

\[83 = 4 \cdot 17 + 15\]
\[17 = 1 \cdot 15 + 2\]
\[15 = 7 \cdot 2 + 1\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(17\) and \(83\) are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(17\) and \(83\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 2\]

Substitute \(2\) from the previous equation \(2 = 17 - 1 \cdot 15\):

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot (17 - 1 \cdot 15)\]

\[1 = 15 + 7 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]

Substitute \(15\) from the first equation \(15 = 83 - 4 \cdot 17\):

\[1 = 8 \cdot (83 - 4 \cdot 17) - 7 \cdot 17\]

Thus, we have:

\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

This equation shows that \(x = -39\) is a solution to \(17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\). However, we want a positive solution between \(0\) and \(82\). To find this, we add \(83\) to \(-39\):

"To find the value of \(5 \star 1\) given the operation \(a \star b = 9a + 2b - ab + 5\), we need to substitute \(a = 5\) and \(b = 1\) into the expression and then simplify step by step.

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the expression for the operation \(\star\):

"To solve the congruence \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\), we first need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 14 and 100, and check if it divides 46. The gcd of 14 and 100 is 2, and since 2 divides 46, the congruence has solutions.

We can simplify the congruence by dividing all terms by 2:
\[7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.\]

Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is a number \(x\) such that:
\[7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}.\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. We start by applying the Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of 7 and 50:
\[50 = 7 \cdot 7 + 1,\]
\[7 = 7 \cdot 1 + 0.\]
The gcd is 1, and since it is 1, 7 and 50 are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express 1 as a combination of 7 and 50:
\[1 = 50 - 7 \cdot 7.\]
From this, we can see that:
\[-7 \cdot 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{50},\]
so the inverse of 7 modulo 50 is \(-7\). Since we typically want a positive inverse, we convert \(-7\) to a positive equivalent by adding 50:
\[-7 + 50 = 43.\]
Thus, the inverse of 7 modulo 50 is 43.

Now, we can solve the simplified congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\) by multiplying both sides by 43:
\[u \equiv 23 \cdot 43 \pmod{50}.\]
We calculate \(23 \cdot 43\):
\[23 \cdot 43 = 989.\]
Next, we find the remainder when 989 is divided by 50:
\[989 \div 50 = 19.78,\]
so the integer part is 19, and the remainder is:
\[989 - 19 \cdot 50 = 989 - 950 = 39.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[u \equiv 39 \pmod{50}.\]
This means that the general solution to the congruence is:
\[u = 39 + 50k,\]
where \(k\) is any integer. The two smallest positive solutions occur when \(k = 0\) and \(k = 1\):
\[u = 39 \quad \text{and} \quad u = 89.\]
The average of these two solutions is:
\[\frac{39 + 89}{2} = \frac{128}{2} = 64.\]
Thus, the average of the two smallest positive solutions is:

"To find the distance between the two buildings on the map in inches, we start with the given information that 3 inches on the map correspond to 10 miles in reality. We need to determine how many inches on the map correspond to 53.25 miles in reality.

First, we set up a proportion based on the given information:
\[
\frac{3 \text{ inches}}{10 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ inches}}{53.25 \text{ miles}}
\]
Here, \( x \) is the distance between the two buildings on the map in inches. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
3 \times 53.25 = 10 \times x
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
159.75 = 10x
\]
Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:
\[
x = \frac{159.75}{10} = 15.975
\]
To express 15.975 as a fraction, we recognize that \( 15.975 = \frac{15975}{1000} \). We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15975 and 1000. The GCD of 15975 and 1000 is 25. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 25:
\[
\frac{15975 \div 25}{1000 \div 25} = \frac{639}{40}

Thus, the distance between the two buildings on the map is \(\boxed{\frac{639}{40}}\) inches.","[639/40, '\\frac{639}{40}']",\frac{639}{40},"[639/40, '\\frac{639}{40}']",True
"Let the two-digit number be represented as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number, with \(a\) being the tens digit and \(b\) being the units digit. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is 13, so we have the equation:

\[a + b = 13.\]

The number with the digits reversed is \(10b + a\). The problem also states that the difference between the original number and the number with the digits reversed is 27, so we have:

\[10a + b - (10b + a) = 27.\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[10a + b - 10b - a = 9a - 9b = 9(a - b).\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[9(a - b) = 27.\]

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

\[a - b = 3.\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(a + b = 13\),
2. \(a - b = 3\).

To solve for \(a\) and \(b\), we can add these two equations together:

\[(a + b) + (a - b) = 13 + 3,\]
\[2a = 16,\]
\[a = 8.\]

Next, we substitute \(a = 8\) back into the first equation:

\[8 + b = 13,\]
\[b = 5.\]

So, the original number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 8 + 5 = 85\). The number with the digits reversed is \(10b + a = 10 \cdot 5 + 8 = 58\).

The sum of the original number and the number with the digits reversed is:

"To find all integer solutions of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (here, \(-14\)) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (here, \(1\)). Since the leading coefficient is \(1\), \( q \) must be \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-14\), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14 \).

We will test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial and checking if the result is zero.

1. Test \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   1^4 + 5 \cdot 1^3 + 9 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 1 \) is a root.

Since \( x = 1 \) is a root, we can factor \( x - 1 \) out of the polynomial. We will use synthetic division to divide \( x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 \) by \( x - 1 \).

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
1 & 1 & 5 & 9 & -1 & -14 \\
  &   & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 & 0 \\

\]
The quotient is \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \). So, we can write:
\[
x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14)
\]

Next, we need to find the integer roots of the cubic polynomial \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \). Again, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14 \).

2. Test \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   1^3 + 6 \cdot 1^2 + 15 \cdot 1 + 14 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 14 = 36 \neq 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root.

3. Test \( x = -1 \):
   \[
   (-1)^3 + 6 \cdot (-1)^2 + 15 \cdot (-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 - 15 + 14 = 4 \neq 0
   \]
   So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root.

4. Test \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 + 6 \cdot 2^2 + 15 \cdot 2 + 14 = 8 + 24 + 30 + 14 = 76 \neq 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is not a root.

5. Test \( x = -2 \):
   \[
   (-2)^3 + 6 \cdot (-2)^2 + 15 \cdot (-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = -2 \) is a root.

Since \( x = -2 \) is a root, we can factor \( x + 2 \) out of the polynomial \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \). We will use synthetic division again to divide \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \) by \( x + 2 \).

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
-2 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
   &   & -2 & -8 & -14 \\
\hline
   & 1 & 4 & 7 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
The quotient is \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \). So, we can write:
\[
x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)
\]

Therefore, the original polynomial can be factored as:
\[
x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)
\]

Next, we need to check if the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) has any real roots. The discriminant of \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) is:
\[
4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7 = 16 - 28 = -12
\]
Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) has no real roots.

"To determine the cost of making a cube with a side length of 3 inches, we need to consider both the cost of the balsa wood and the cost of the paint. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the cost per unit volume of the balsa wood and the cost per unit area of the paint.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per unit volume of the balsa wood
The volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[ V = s^3 \]

For a cube with side length 1 inch:
\[ V_1 = 1^3 = 1 \text{ cubic inch} \]
The cost for this cube is \$1.30, so the cost per cubic inch of balsa wood is:
\[ \text{Cost per cubic inch} = \frac{1.30}{1} = 1.30 \text{ dollars per cubic inch} \]

For a cube with side length 2 inches:
\[ V_2 = 2^3 = 8 \text{ cubic inches} \]
The cost for this cube is \$6.80, so the cost per cubic inch of balsa wood is:
\[ \text{Cost per cubic inch} = \frac{6.80}{8} = 0.85 \text{ dollars per cubic inch} \]

Since the cost per cubic inch should be consistent, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The cost per cubic inch should be the same for both cubes. Let's use the correct approach by considering the total cost as a combination of the cost of the balsa wood and the cost of the paint.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per unit area of the paint
The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[ A = 6s^2 \]

For a cube with side length 1 inch:
\[ A_1 = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \text{ square inches} \]
The cost for this cube is \$1.30, so the cost per square inch of paint is:
\[ \text{Cost per square inch} = \frac{1.30 - \text{cost of balsa wood}}{6} \]

For a cube with side length 2 inches:
\[ A_2 = 6 \times 2^2 = 24 \text{ square inches} \]
The cost for this cube is \$6.80, so the cost per square inch of paint is:
\[ \text{Cost per square inch} = \frac{6.80 - \text{cost of balsa wood}}{24} \]

Since the cost per square inch should be consistent, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's use the correct approach by considering the total cost as a combination of the cost of the balsa wood and the cost of the paint.

### Step 3: Use the correct approach
Let's assume the cost of the balsa wood per cubic inch is \( C_b \) and the cost of the paint per square inch is \( C_p \).

For a cube with side length 1 inch:
\[ \text{Total cost} = C_b \times 1 + C_p \times 6 = 1.30 \]

For a cube with side length 2 inches:
\[ \text{Total cost} = C_b \times 8 + C_p \times 24 = 6.80 \]

We have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C_b + 6C_p = 1.30 \)
2. \( 8C_b + 24C_p = 6.80 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing by 8:
\[ C_b + 3C_p = 0.85 \]

Now we have:
1. \( C_b + 6C_p = 1.30 \)
2. \( C_b + 3C_p = 0.85 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (C_b + 6C_p) - (C_b + 3C_p) = 1.30 - 0.85 \]
\[ 3C_p = 0.45 \]
\[ C_p = 0.15 \]

Substitute \( C_p = 0.15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ C_b + 3 \times 0.15 = 0.85 \]
\[ C_b + 0.45 = 0.85 \]
\[ C_b = 0.40 \]

Now we know the cost per cubic inch of balsa wood is \$0.40 and the cost per square inch of paint is \$0.15.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of a cube with side length 3 inches
For a cube with side length 3 inches:
\[ V_3 = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cubic inches} \]
\[ A_3 = 6 \times 3^2 = 54 \text{ square inches} \]
The total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = C_b \times 27 + C_p \times 54 = 0.40 \times 27 + 0.15 \times 54 = 10.80 + 8.10 = 18.90 \]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the largest possible amount of paper money:**
   The largest paper money denominations are \$100, \$50, \$20, \$10, \$5, and \$1. We need to convert the total amount of 12659 cents into these denominations.

   - First, convert \$100 into cents: \$100 = 10000 cents
   - Next, convert \$50 into cents: \$50 = 5000 cents
   - Next, convert \$20 into cents: \$20 = 2000 cents
   - Next, convert \$10 into cents: \$10 = 1000 cents
   - Next, convert \$5 into cents: \$5 = 500 cents
   - Next, convert \$1 into cents: \$1 = 100 cents

   We start with the largest denomination and work our way down:
   - The largest number of \$100 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{12659}{10000} \right\rfloor = 1 \quad \text{(which is \$100)}
     \]
     So, we have 10000 cents from the \$100 bill, leaving:
     \[
     12659 - 10000 = 2659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$50 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{2659}{5000} \right\rfloor = 0 \quad \text{(which is \$0)}
     \]
     So, we have 0 cents from the \$50 bills, leaving:
     \[
     2659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$20 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{2659}{2000} \right\rfloor = 1 \quad \text{(which is \$20)}
     \]
     So, we have 2000 cents from the \$20 bill, leaving:
     \[
     2659 - 2000 = 659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$10 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{659}{1000} \right\rfloor = 0 \quad \text{(which is \$0)}
     \]
     So, we have 0 cents from the \$10 bills, leaving:
     \[
     659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$5 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{659}{500} \right\rfloor = 1 \quad \text{(which is \$5)}
     \]
     So, we have 500 cents from the \$5 bill, leaving:
     \[
     659 - 500 = 159 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$1 bills that can be given is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{159}{100} \right\rfloor = 1 \quad \text{(which is \$1)}
     \]
     So, we have 100 cents from the \$1 bill, leaving:
     \[
     159 - 100 = 59 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The remaining 59 cents cannot be converted into any paper money, so it is the leftover amount.

Therefore, the leftover amount after converting the total earnings into the largest possible amount of paper money is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To determine the number of values of \( x \) that make the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) undefined, we need to identify the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. The expression is undefined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is not allowed in mathematics.

The denominator of the expression is \( x^2 - 9 \). We can factor this expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3). \]
So, the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) becomes \(\frac{x-5}{(x-3)(x+3)}\).

The expression \(\frac{x-5}{(x-3)(x+3)}\) is undefined when the denominator \((x-3)(x+3) = 0\). Therefore, we need to solve the equation:
\[ (x-3)(x+3) = 0. \]
This equation is satisfied when either \( x-3 = 0 \) or \( x+3 = 0 \). Solving these equations, we get:
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3. \]
Thus, the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) is undefined for \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \).

There are two values of \( x \) that make the expression undefined. Therefore, the number of values of \( x \) that make the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) undefined is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the given system of equations, we start with the two equations:

1. \(\log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = 2\)
2. \(\log_y 5x = 2\)

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b a + \log_b c = \log_b (ac)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:
\[
\log_6 ((x-y)(x+y)) = 2
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2
\]
Since \(\log_6 36 = 2\), we have:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 36
\]

Next, we use the second equation \(\log_y 5x = 2\). This can be rewritten in its exponential form as:
\[
y^2 = 5x
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(x^2 - y^2 = 36\)
2. \(y^2 = 5x\)

We substitute \(y^2\) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x = 36
\]
This is a quadratic equation, which we can rewrite as:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -36\):
\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 144}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 13}{2}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
x = \frac{5 + 13}{2} = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 13}{2} = -4
\]

Since \(x\) must be positive (because it is the argument of a logarithm in the original equations), we discard \(x = -4\) and keep \(x = 9\).

To verify, we substitute \(x = 9\) back into the equation \(y^2 = 5x\):
\[
y^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \implies y = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]
We check the first equation with \(x = 9\) and \(y = 3\sqrt{5}\):
\[
\log_6 (9 - 3\sqrt{5}) + \log_6 (9 + 3\sqrt{5}) = \log_6 ((9 - 3\sqrt{5})(9 + 3\sqrt{5})) = \log_6 (81 - 45) = \log_6 36 = 2

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is:

"To determine the number of positive integers with exactly three positive divisors, we need to understand the properties of such numbers. A number has exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because the divisors of \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is a prime number) are \( 1, p, \) and \( p^2 \).

Let's list the squares of the smallest prime numbers in increasing order:
1. The smallest prime number is \( 2 \). Therefore, \( 2^2 = 4 \).
2. The next prime number is \( 3 \). Therefore, \( 3^2 = 9 \).
3. The next prime number is \( 5 \). Therefore, \( 5^2 = 25 \).
4. The next prime number is \( 7 \). Therefore, \( 7^2 = 49 \).
5. The next prime number is \( 11 \). Therefore, \( 11^2 = 121 \).

Thus, the first five positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are \( 4, 9, 25, 49, \) and \( 121 \). The number in the fourth position of this list is \( 49 \).

Therefore, the number fourth in the list is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",121,"[121, '121']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the given polynomial can be expressed as a geometric series. The polynomial is:

\[z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1.\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[\frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} = 0,\]

for \(z \neq -1\). The roots of the equation \(z^9 + 1 = 0\) are the 9th roots of \(-1\), which are given by:

\[z = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8.\]

However, we must exclude the root \(z = -1\), which corresponds to \(k = 4\). Therefore, the roots of the original polynomial are:

\[z = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.\]

These roots are all on the unit circle, so \(r = 1\). The angles \(\theta\) corresponding to these roots are:

\[\theta = \frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{3\pi}{9} = \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{9}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \frac{11\pi}{9}, \frac{13\pi}{9}, \frac{15\pi}{9} = \frac{5\pi}{3}, \frac{17\pi}{9}.\]

To find the sum of all these values of \(\theta\), we add them together:

\[\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{3} + \frac{17\pi}{9}.\]

First, we convert \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) to have a common denominator of 9:

\[\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{3\pi}{9}, \quad \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{15\pi}{9}.\]

Now we can add all the fractions:

\[\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{3\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{15\pi}{9} + \frac{17\pi}{9} = \frac{(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17)\pi}{9}.\]

The sum of the numerators is:

\[1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 72.\]

Therefore, the sum of all the values of \(\theta\) is:

\[\frac{72\pi}{9} = 8\pi.\]

From the figure, we can see that the base of the triangle is the distance between the points \((0,0)\) and \((10,0)\), which is 10 cm. The height of the triangle is the distance from the point \((2,3)\) to the base, which is 3 cm.

"To determine the number of integer values of \( t \) such that the square root of \( t \) is greater than 2 and less than 3.5, we start by expressing this condition mathematically. We have:

To eliminate the square root, we square all parts of the inequality:

\[ 2^2 < t < 3.5^2 \]

This simplifies to:

Since \( t \) must be an integer, we consider the integers in the interval from 5 to 12, inclusive. These integers are:

1. Determine the value of \(\sqrt{20}\).
2. Find the ceiling of \(\sqrt{20}\).
3. Square the ceiling value.

First, let's find the approximate value of \(\sqrt{20}\). We know that:
\[4^2 = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad 5^2 = 25.\]
Since \(16 < 20 < 25\), it follows that:
\[4 < \sqrt{20} < 5.\]
To get a more precise estimate, we can use a calculator to find:
\[\sqrt{20} \approx 4.472.\]

Next, we need to find the ceiling of \(\sqrt{20}\). The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\). Since \(\sqrt{20} \approx 4.472\), the ceiling of \(\sqrt{20}\) is 5. Therefore:
\[\lceil \sqrt{20} \rceil = 5.\]

Now, we need to square the ceiling value:

"To find the maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) given that \( a + b + c + d = 10 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
\]

with equality if and only if \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n \).

We can rewrite \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) in a form that allows us to apply the AM-GM inequality. Let \( a = x_1 \), \( b = x_2 \), \( c = x_3 \), and \( d = x_4 \). Then we have:

\[
a + b + c + d = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10
\]

We want to maximize \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 = x_1 x_2^2 x_3^3 x_4^4 \). To apply the AM-GM inequality, we can write:

\[
\frac{x_1 + \frac{x_2}{2} + \frac{x_2}{2} + \frac{x_3}{3} + \frac{x_3}{3} + \frac{x_3}{3} + \frac{x_4}{4} + \frac{x_4}{4} + \frac{x_4}{4} + \frac{x_4}{4}}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{x_1 \left(\frac{x_2}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{x_3}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{x_4}{4}\right)^4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1
\]

So the inequality becomes:

\[
1 \geq \sqrt[10]{x_1 \left(\frac{x_2}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{x_3}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{x_4}{4}\right)^4}
\]

Raising both sides to the 10th power, we get:

\[
1 \geq x_1 \left(\frac{x_2}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{x_3}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{x_4}{4}\right)^4
\]

\[
1 \geq x_1 \frac{x_2^2}{4} \frac{x_3^3}{27} \frac{x_4^4}{256}
\]

\[
1 \geq \frac{x_1 x_2^2 x_3^3 x_4^4}{4 \cdot 27 \cdot 256}
\]

\[
1 \geq \frac{x_1 x_2^2 x_3^3 x_4^4}{27648}
\]

\[
x_1 x_2^2 x_3^3 x_4^4 \leq 27648
\]

Equality holds in the AM-GM inequality when \( x_1 = \frac{x_2}{2} = \frac{x_3}{3} = \frac{x_4}{4} \). Let \( x_1 = k \). Then \( x_2 = 2k \), \( x_3 = 3k \), and \( x_4 = 4k \). Substituting these into the constraint \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10 \), we get:

\[
k + 2k + 3k + 4k = 10
\]

\[
10k = 10
\]

\[
k = 1
\]

So \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 2 \), \( x_3 = 3 \), and \( x_4 = 4 \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) is:

\[
ab^2 c^3 d^4 = 1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 4^4 = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 27 \cdot 256 = 27648

"To determine how far a car traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour will go in \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the mixed number \(2\frac{3}{4}\) into an improper fraction.
2. Multiply the speed by the time to find the distance.

First, let's convert the mixed number \(2\frac{3}{4}\) into an improper fraction. The number \(2\frac{3}{4}\) can be written as:
\[2\frac{3}{4} = 2 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{4}.\]

Now, we need to multiply the speed of the car by the time. The speed is 50 miles per hour and the time is \(\frac{11}{4}\) hours. The distance \(d\) can be calculated using the formula:
\[d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}.\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[d = 50 \times \frac{11}{4}.\]

To simplify this, we can cancel out the common factor between 50 and 4. The number 50 can be written as \(\frac{50}{1}\), so:
\[d = \frac{50}{1} \times \frac{11}{4} = \frac{50 \times 11}{1 \times 4} = \frac{550}{4}.\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{550}{4}\) by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[\frac{550}{4} = \frac{550 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{275}{2}.\]

Finally, we convert the improper fraction \(\frac{275}{2}\) into a mixed number. We do this by dividing 275 by 2, which gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Therefore, \(\frac{275}{2} = 137\frac{1}{2}\).

So, the distance the car will travel in \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours is \(\boxed{137\frac{1}{2}}\) miles.","[275/2, '137\\frac{1}{2}']",137 \frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals are equal. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline

\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[

\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 4(7) - 13 \implies 14 + 1 = 28 - 13 \implies 15 = 15

The change of base formula states that \(\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}\). We will use the natural logarithm (base \(e\)) for convenience.

Applying the change of base formula to each logarithm, we get:
\[
\log_2{3} = \frac{\ln{3}}{\ln{2}}, \quad \log_3{4} = \frac{\ln{4}}{\ln{3}}, \quad \log_4{5} = \frac{\ln{5}}{\ln{4}}, \quad \log_5{6} = \frac{\ln{6}}{\ln{5}}, \quad \log_6{7} = \frac{\ln{7}}{\ln{6}}, \quad \log_7{8} = \frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{7}}

Now, we substitute these into the original expression:
\[
\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8} = \left(\frac{\ln{3}}{\ln{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{4}}{\ln{3}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{5}}{\ln{4}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{6}}{\ln{5}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{7}}{\ln{6}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{7}}\right)

Notice that this is a telescoping product, where most terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel out:
\[

We can simplify \(\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{2}}\) using the property of logarithms that \(\ln{a^b} = b \ln{a}\). Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:
\[
\ln{8} = \ln{2^3} = 3 \ln{2}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{2}} = \frac{3 \ln{2}}{\ln{2}} = 3
\]

Thus, the value of \(\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling a specific face \( F \) on a biased six-sided die and then use this information to find the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two such dice.

First, let's denote the probabilities of rolling each face of the die as follows:
- \( P(1) = p_1 \)
- \( P(2) = p_2 \)
- \( P(3) = p_3 \)
- \( P(4) = p_4 \)
- \( P(5) = p_5 \)
- \( P(6) = p_6 \)

Given that the probability of rolling a face \( F \) is greater than \( \frac{1}{6} \), the probability of rolling the face opposite to \( F \) is less than \( \frac{1}{6} \), and the probability of rolling any other face is \( \frac{1}{6} \), we can assume without loss of generality that \( F = 6 \). Therefore, \( P(6) > \frac{1}{6} \) and \( P(1) < \frac{1}{6} \) (since 1 is opposite to 6). The probabilities of rolling the other faces are:
- \( P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = \frac{1}{6} \)

The sum of the probabilities must be 1, so we have:
\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ p_1 + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + p_6 = 1 \]
\[ p_1 + \frac{2}{3} + p_6 = 1 \]
\[ p_1 + p_6 = \frac{1}{3} \]

Since \( p_1 < \frac{1}{6} \) and \( p_6 > \frac{1}{6} \), we can express \( p_6 \) as:
\[ p_6 = \frac{1}{3} - p_1 \]
where \( 0 < p_1 < \frac{1}{6} \).

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two such dice. The pairs that sum to 7 are:
- (1, 6)
- (2, 5)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 3)
- (5, 2)
- (6, 1)

The probability of each pair is the product of the probabilities of rolling each face. Therefore, the total probability of rolling a sum of 7 is:
\[ P(\text{sum} = 7) = P(1)P(6) + P(2)P(5) + P(3)P(4) + P(4)P(3) + P(5)P(2) + P(6)P(1) \]
\[ P(\text{sum} = 7) = p_1 p_6 + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + p_6 p_1 \]
\[ P(\text{sum} = 7) = 2p_1 p_6 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{36} \]
\[ P(\text{sum} = 7) = 2p_1 p_6 + \frac{1}{9} \]

We know that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is \( \frac{47}{288} \), so:
\[ 2p_1 p_6 + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288} \]
\[ 2p_1 p_6 = \frac{47}{288} - \frac{1}{9} \]
\[ 2p_1 p_6 = \frac{47}{288} - \frac{32}{288} \]
\[ 2p_1 p_6 = \frac{15}{288} \]
\[ 2p_1 p_6 = \frac{5}{96} \]
\[ p_1 p_6 = \frac{5}{192} \]

Substituting \( p_6 = \frac{1}{3} - p_1 \) into the equation:
\[ p_1 \left( \frac{1}{3} - p_1 \right) = \frac{5}{192} \]
\[ \frac{p_1}{3} - p_1^2 = \frac{5}{192} \]
\[ 64p_1 - 192p_1^2 = 5 \]
\[ 192p_1^2 - 64p_1 + 5 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( p_1 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 192 \), \( b = -64 \), and \( c = 5 \):
\[ p_1 = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{(-64)^2 - 4 \cdot 192 \cdot 5}}{2 \cdot 192} \]
\[ p_1 = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{4096 - 3840}}{384} \]
\[ p_1 = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{256}}{384} \]
\[ p_1 = \frac{64 \pm 16}{384} \]
\[ p_1 = \frac{80}{384} = \frac{5}{24} \quad \text{or} \quad p_1 = \frac{48}{384} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Since \( p_1 < \frac{1}{6} \), we have \( p_1 = \frac{1}{8} \). Therefore, \( p_6 = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{8}{24} - \frac{3}{24} = \frac{5}{24} \).

The probability of rolling a face \( F \) is \( p_6 = \frac{5}{24} \). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[ m + n = 5 + 24 = 29 \]

Thus, the answer is:

"To determine how many feet Jim goes fewer than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes directly from one corner of the rectangular field to the opposite corner, which is the length of the diagonal. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and then along the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[ \text{Distance} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]
So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet} \]
Therefore, Jim goes fewer than Martha by \(\boxed{200}\) feet.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To determine how many different values \( B \) can take, we need to find all possible values of \( B \) such that the number \( B6 \) is a perfect square. The number \( B6 \) can be expressed as \( 10B + 6 \), where \( B \) is a digit from 1 to 9 (since \( B \) is the tens digit of a two-digit number).

We need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 10B + 6 \). This implies that \( n^2 \equiv 6 \pmod{10} \). We will check the squares of all possible residues modulo 10 to see which ones satisfy this congruence.

The possible residues modulo 10 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We calculate their squares:
\[
\begin{aligned}
0^2 &\equiv 0 \pmod{10}, \\
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{10}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{10}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{10}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 6 \pmod{10}, \\
5^2 &\equiv 5 \pmod{10}, \\
6^2 &\equiv 6 \pmod{10}, \\
7^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{10}, \\
8^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{10}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{10}.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the above, we see that the only residues whose squares are congruent to 6 modulo 10 are 4 and 6. Therefore, \( n \) must be of the form \( 10k + 4 \) or \( 10k + 6 \) for some integer \( k \).

Next, we need to find the corresponding values of \( B \) for these values of \( n \). We start with \( n = 4 \):
\[
n^2 = 16 \implies 10B + 6 = 16 \implies 10B = 10 \implies B = 1.
\]
Now, we try \( n = 6 \):
\[
n^2 = 36 \implies 10B + 6 = 36 \implies 10B = 30 \implies B = 3.
\]
Next, we try \( n = 14 \):
\[
n^2 = 196 \implies 10B + 6 = 196 \implies 10B = 190 \implies B = 19.
\]
Since \( B \) must be a single digit, \( B = 19 \) is not a valid solution. Similarly, for \( n = 16 \):
\[
n^2 = 256 \implies 10B + 6 = 256 \implies 10B = 250 \implies B = 25,
\]
which is also not a valid solution. We can see that for \( n = 10k + 4 \) or \( n = 10k + 6 \) with \( k \geq 2 \), \( B \) will be greater than 9, so these values are not valid.

Therefore, the only valid values for \( B \) are 1 and 3. There are 2 different values that \( B \) can take.

"To find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation

\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,
\]

we start by rewriting the left-hand side of the equation. Notice that each term can be expressed as a partial fraction decomposition. Specifically, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{1/2}{x-1} - \frac{1/2}{x+1},
\]
\[
\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \frac{2}{(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})} = \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{x-\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{x+\sqrt{2}},

\[
\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} = \frac{3}{(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})} = \frac{3/2}{x-\sqrt{3}} - \frac{3/2}{x+\sqrt{3}},
\]
\[
\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{4}{(x-2)(x+2)} = \frac{1}{x-2} - \frac{1}{x+2}.

Adding these decompositions together, we get:

\[

\]

Now, let's denote the left-hand side by \( f(x) \). The equation becomes:

\[
f(x) = 2010x - 4.
\]

To find the sum of all complex solutions, we need to consider the degree of the polynomial equation obtained after eliminating the denominators. The function \( f(x) \) has vertical asymptotes at \( x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2 \), so the polynomial equation will have a degree of 8 (since there are 8 such asymptotes).

The polynomial equation can be written as:

\[
P(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)(2010x - 4) - \left( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + \frac{3}{2}(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \right) = 0.
\]

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \). In our case, the polynomial \( P(x) \) is of degree 8, and the coefficient of \( x^7 \) will be the sum of the coefficients of \( x^7 \) from each term in the expansion. However, we can use a simpler approach by noting that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \) is 0 (since it is an even function), and the term \( 2010x - 4 \) does not affect the sum of the roots of the polynomial when multiplied by \( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \).

"To determine the sum of all prime numbers \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has no solution, we need to analyze the conditions under which this congruence has a solution.

A congruence \( ax \equiv b \pmod{p} \) has a solution if and only if \( \gcd(a, p) \) divides \( b \). In our case, \( a = 8 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( p \) is a prime number. Therefore, the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution if and only if \( \gcd(8, p) \) divides 1.

The greatest common divisor \( \gcd(8, p) \) can only be 1 or 2 or 4 or 8. For the congruence to have no solution, \( \gcd(8, p) \) must be greater than 1. This means \( p \) must be a divisor of 8. The prime divisors of 8 are 2.

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

First, we simplify the expression \((2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\):
\[
(2k)^4 = 16k^4,
\]
so
\[
(2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = 16k^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{64k^4 + 1}{4}.

Next, we simplify the expression \((2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\):
\[
(2k-1)^4 = (4k^2 - 4k + 1)^2 = 16k^4 - 32k^3 + 24k^2 - 8k + 1,

so
\[
(2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = 16k^4 - 32k^3 + 24k^2 - 8k + 1 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{64k^4 - 128k^3 + 96k^2 - 32k + 5}{4}.

To further simplify, we use the identity for the sum of fourth powers:
\[

Similarly, we can factorize \((2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\):
\[
(2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \left(4k^2 - 4k + 1 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 4k + 1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(4k^2 - 4k + \frac{3}{2}\right)\left(4k^2 - 4k + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{(8k^2 - 8k + 3)(8k^2 - 4k + 1)}{4}.

"To determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly chosen positive odd integer is less than 2010 and results in a finite decimal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the condition for a finite decimal:**
   A fraction \(\frac{1}{n}\) has a finite decimal representation if and only if the denominator \(n\) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Since \(n\) is an odd integer, the only possible prime factor of \(n\) is 5. Therefore, \(n\) must be of the form \(5^k\) for some non-negative integer \(k\).

2. **Find the largest power of 5 less than 2010:**
   We need to find the largest integer \(k\) such that \(5^k < 2010\).
   \[
   5^0 = 1, \quad 5^1 = 5, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad 5^3 = 125, \quad 5^4 = 625, \quad 5^5 = 3125
   \]
   Since \(5^5 = 3125 > 2010\) and \(5^4 = 625 < 2010\), the largest power of 5 less than 2010 is \(5^4 = 625\).

3. **List all odd integers of the form \(5^k\) less than 2010:**
   The odd integers of the form \(5^k\) less than 2010 are \(5^0, 5^1, 5^2, 5^3,\) and \(5^4\), which are \(1, 5, 25, 125,\) and \(625\).

4. **Count the number of positive odd integers less than 2010:**
   The positive odd integers less than 2010 are \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, 2009\). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a = 1\), the common difference \(d = 2\), and the last term \(l = 2009\). The number of terms \(n\) in this sequence is given by:
   \[
   l = a + (n-1)d \implies 2009 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies 2008 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n-1 = 1004 \implies n = 1005
   \]
   So, there are 1005 positive odd integers less than 2010.

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the reciprocal of a randomly chosen positive odd integer less than 2010 is less than 2010 and results in a finite decimal is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. There are 5 favorable outcomes (1, 5, 25, 125, 625) and 1005 total outcomes.

\]
According to the problem, the area is also given by:
\[
\text{Area} = a^2 - (b - c)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
a^2 - (b - c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2.
\]
Next, we use the Law of Cosines, which states:
\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = 2bc - 2bc \cos A.

Factoring out \(2bc\) on the right-hand side, we have:
\[

Dividing both sides by \(bc\) (assuming \(bc \neq 0\)), we get:

This is a quadratic equation in \(\cos A\). We solve it using the quadratic formula \(\cos A = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 17\), \(b = -32\), and \(c = 15\):
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15}}{2 \cdot 17},
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34},
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{4}}{34},
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm 2}{34}.
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
\cos A = \frac{34}{34} = 1 \quad \text{(not possible since \(\sin A \neq 0\))},
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{30}{34} = \frac{15}{17}.
\]
Thus, \(\cos A = \frac{15}{17}\). Substituting this back into \(\sin A = 4 (1 - \cos A)\), we get:
\[
\sin A = 4 \left(1 - \frac{15}{17}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{2}{17}\right) = \frac{8}{17}.
\]
Finally, we find \(\tan A\):
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{\frac{8}{17}}{\frac{15}{17}} = \frac{8}{15}.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(\tan A\) is:

"To determine the volume of the cube, we first need to find the side length of the cube. The problem states that a sphere with a radius of 3 inches is created by removing metal from the corners of a cube with the shortest possible edge length. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube because the sphere is inscribed in the cube.

The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so:
\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ inches}
\]
Therefore, the edge length of the cube is 6 inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of the cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, \(V = s^3\), where \(s\) is the edge length of the cube:
\[
V = 6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216 \text{ cubic inches}

The quotient is 19, and the remainder can be found by multiplying the quotient by 4 and subtracting the result from 78:

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15| \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function within this interval. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we rewrite the function \( f(x) \) by considering the absolute value expressions:
\[ f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15|. \]

Since \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we know the following:
1. \( x - p \geq 0 \), so \( |x-p| = x-p \).
2. \( x - 15 \leq 0 \), so \( |x-15| = 15-x \).
3. \( x - p - 15 \leq 0 \), so \( |x-p-15| = 15 + p - x \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (15+p-x) = x - p + 15 - x + 15 + p - x = 30 - x. \]

Now, we need to find the minimum value of \( f(x) = 30 - x \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \). Since \( 30 - x \) is a linear function that decreases as \( x \) increases, the minimum value will occur at the maximum value of \( x \) within the interval, which is \( x = 15 \).

Substituting \( x = 15 \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(15) = 30 - 15 = 15. \]

Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) when \( x \) lies in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \) is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",15,"[15, '15']",True

"To determine the set of vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) such that the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is the zero vector, we start with the formula for the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\):

\[
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then, the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2x + y
\]

Substituting these into the projection formula, we get:

\[

We are given that this projection is the zero vector:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{4x + 2y}{5} \\ \frac{2x + y}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}

"To find the value of \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3\) in the form \(a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{6}\), we start by expanding the expression using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3
\]

Here, \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(y = \sqrt{3}\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3 = (\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\sqrt{2})^2(\sqrt{3}) + 3(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{3})^3
\]

Next, we simplify each term individually:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^3 = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
3(\sqrt{2})^2(\sqrt{3}) = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}

\[
3(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 = 9\sqrt{2}

\[

"To determine the area of the set \( S \) of points \((a, b)\) such that the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) has at least one real root, we start by analyzing the polynomial and its properties.

First, note that if \( x = 0 \) is a root, then the constant term of the polynomial must be zero, which is not the case here since the constant term is 1. Therefore, \( x = 0 \) is not a root.

Next, consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 \). If \( x = r \) is a real root, then \( P(r) = 0 \). We can rewrite the polynomial in a form that might help us find conditions on \( a \) and \( b \).

Notice that if we divide \( P(x) \) by \( x^2 \), we get:
\[ x^2 + ax - b + \frac{a}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0. \]
Let \( y = x + \frac{1}{x} \). Then \( y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \), so \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2 \). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ y^2 - 2 + ay - b = 0, \]
or
\[ y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). For \( y \) to be real, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative:
\[ a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge 0, \]
or
\[ a^2 + 4b + 8 \ge 0. \]
This inequality is always true since \( a^2 \ge 0 \) and \( 4b + 8 \ge 8 \) for \( 0 \le b \le 1 \).

However, we also need to ensure that \( y = x + \frac{1}{x} \) is real and within the range of possible values for \( x + \frac{1}{x} \). For \( x > 0 \), \( x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2 \) by the AM-GM inequality, and for \( x < 0 \), \( x + \frac{1}{x} \le -2 \). Therefore, \( y \) must satisfy \( |y| \ge 2 \).

We now solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0 \) for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}. \]
For \( y \ge 2 \), we need:
\[ \frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 2, \]
or
\[ -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4, \]
or
\[ \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge a + 4. \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge a^2 + 8a + 16, \]
or
\[ 4b + 8 \ge 8a + 16, \]
or
\[ b \ge 2a + 2. \]
Since \( 0 \le b \le 1 \), this inequality is impossible for any \( a \ge 0 \).

For \( y \le -2 \), we need:
\[ \frac{-a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \le -2, \]
or
\[ -a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \le -4, \]
or
\[ \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 - a. \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge a^2 - 8a + 16, \]
or
\[ 4b + 8 \ge -8a + 16, \]
or
\[ b \ge -2a + 2. \]
Since \( 0 \le b \le 1 \), this inequality is always true for \( 0 \le a \le 1 \).

Therefore, the set \( S \) is the region below the line \( b = -2a + 2 \) in the unit square \( 0 \le a \le 1 \) and \( 0 \le b \le 1 \). This region is a right triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((1, 1)\). The area of this triangle is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the function is defined and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the constraints on the inner expression \( \log(x-2) \):**
   - The argument of the logarithm must be positive, so \( x-2 > 0 \). This simplifies to \( x > 2 \).

2. **Identify the constraints on the expression inside the outer logarithm \( 2 - \log(x-2) \):**
   - The argument of the outer logarithm must also be positive, so \( 2 - \log(x-2) > 0 \). This simplifies to \( \log(x-2) < 2 \).
   - Since the base of the logarithm is 10, we can rewrite this inequality as \( x-2 < 10^2 \), which simplifies to \( x-2 < 100 \) or \( x < 102 \).

3. **Combine the constraints from steps 1 and 2:**
   - From step 1, we have \( x > 2 \).
   - From step 2, we have \( x < 102 \).
   - Therefore, combining these, we get \( 2 < x < 102 \).

4. **Ensure the denominator is not zero:**
   - The denominator is \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \). We need to ensure that \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \neq 0 \).
   - This means \( 2 - \log(x-2) \neq 10^0 \), which simplifies to \( 2 - \log(x-2) \neq 1 \) or \( \log(x-2) \neq 1 \).
   - Since the base of the logarithm is 10, we can rewrite this inequality as \( x-2 \neq 10^1 \), which simplifies to \( x-2 \neq 10 \) or \( x \neq 12 \).

"To find the magnitude \( |w| \) of the complex number \( w = \frac{3z+1}{5z+7} \) where \( z = 1+i \), we will follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( z = 1+i \) into the expression for \( w \).
2. Simplify the expression by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.
3. Calculate the magnitudes of the resulting numerator and denominator.
4. Divide the magnitude of the numerator by the magnitude of the denominator to get \( |w| \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ w = \frac{3(1+i) + 1}{5(1+i) + 7} = \frac{3 + 3i + 1}{5 + 5i + 7} = \frac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i} \]

Next, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is \( 12 - 5i \):

\[ w = \frac{(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)}{(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)} \]

The denominator simplifies as follows:

\[ (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169 \]

Now, we expand the numerator:

\[ (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) = 4 \cdot 12 + 4 \cdot (-5i) + 3i \cdot 12 + 3i \cdot (-5i) = 48 - 20i + 36i - 15i^2 \]
\[ = 48 + 16i - 15(-1) = 48 + 16i + 15 = 63 + 16i \]

So, we have:

\[ w = \frac{63 + 16i}{169} = \frac{63}{169} + \frac{16}{169}i \]

The magnitude \( |w| \) of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Therefore, the magnitude of \( w \) is:

\[ |w| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{63}{169} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{16}{169} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{63^2}{169^2} + \frac{16^2}{169^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3969 + 256}{169^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4225}{169^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{4225}}{169} = \frac{65}{169} = \frac{5}{13} \]

Specifically, we can divide the octagon into a square and four right triangles.

First, let's visualize the octagon. The four sides of length \(1\) form the sides of a square, and the four sides of length \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) form the legs of four right triangles that are attached to the sides of the square.

The side length of the square is equal to the length of the longer sides of the octagon, which is \(1\). Therefore, the area of the square is:

Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the four triangles is:

\[ a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} \]
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1} = 1 - \frac{1}{a_1} \]

Since \( a_3 = a_1 \), we have:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{a_1} = a_1 \]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ 1 = a_1 + \frac{1}{a_1} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( a_1 \), we obtain:
\[ a_1^2 = a_1^2 + 1 \]
Subtracting \( a_1^2 \) from both sides, we get:
\[ 0 = 1 \]
This is a contradiction, so we must re-evaluate our approach. Instead, let's consider the periodicity of the sequence. We know that \( a_3 = a_1 \), so the sequence is periodic with a period of 2. Therefore, \( a_4 = a_2 \), \( a_5 = a_3 = a_1 \), \( a_6 = a_2 \), and so on.

To find \( a_9 \), we note that \( 9 \) is an odd number, so \( a_9 = a_1 \). We need to find \( (a_9)^9 = a_1^9 \).

From the equation \( a_1 + \frac{1}{a_1} = 1 \), we can solve for \( a_1 \). Let \( a_1 = x \). Then:
\[ x + \frac{1}{x} = 1 \]
Multiplying both sides by \( x \), we get:
\[ x^2 + 1 = x \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = 1 \):
\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

We need to find \( x^9 \). Let's use the polar form of the complex number. The magnitude of \( x \) is:
\[ |x| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1 \]
The argument of \( x \) is:
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} \right) = \tan^{-1} (\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \]
So, in polar form, \( x = e^{i\pi/3} \) or \( x = e^{-i\pi/3} \).

Using De Moivre's theorem, we have:
\[ x^9 = \left( e^{i\pi/3} \right)^9 = e^{i3\pi} = \cos 3\pi + i \sin 3\pi = -1 \]
or
\[ x^9 = \left( e^{-i\pi/3} \right)^9 = e^{-i3\pi} = \cos (-3\pi) + i \sin (-3\pi) = -1 \]

Therefore, \( a_1^9 = -1 \), and the value of \( (a_9)^9 \) is:

"To find the measure of \(\angle AHB\) in \(\triangle ABC\) where \(\overline{AD}\) and \(\overline{BE}\) are the altitudes intersecting at the orthocenter \(H\), and given \(\angle BAC = 54^\circ\) and \(\angle ABC = 52^\circ\), we can use properties of the orthocenter and the angles in a triangle.

First, we calculate \(\angle ACB\):
\[
\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 54^\circ - 52^\circ = 74^\circ.
\]

The orthocenter \(H\) of a triangle has a useful property: the measure of \(\angle AHB\) is related to the measure of \(\angle ACB\) by the formula:
\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - \angle ACB.
\]
Substituting the value of \(\angle ACB\) we found:
\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - 74^\circ = 106^\circ.
\]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle AHB\) is \(\boxed{106}\).","[106, '106']",106^\circ,"[106, '106']",True
