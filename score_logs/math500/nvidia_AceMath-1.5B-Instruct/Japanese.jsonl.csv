"To convert the Cartesian coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the radius \(r\)**:
   The radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to the point \((0, 3)\). It can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate the angle \(\theta\)**:
   The angle \(\theta\) is the angle formed with the positive x-axis. It can be calculated using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
   \]
   Since \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive y-axis. Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

3. **Combine the results**:
   Now we have \(r = 3\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Thus, the polar coordinates are:
   \[
   (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2})
   \]

Finally, we present the answer in the required format:

"To find the value of the sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), we start by interchanging the order of summation. The sum can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Here, \(n = j + k\) and for each fixed \(n\), \(j\) ranges from 1 to \(n-1\). Therefore, the inner sum \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1\) simply counts the number of terms, which is \(n-1\). Thus, the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3}
\]

We can split this sum into two separate sums:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n}{n^3} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

We can express these sums in terms of \(p\) and \(q\):

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1
\]
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q

Therefore, the value of the sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) is \(\boxed{p - q}\).","[p - q, 'p - q']",p - q,[],True
"To find the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} \), we will evaluate \( f(x) \) at each of these points separately and then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f(-2) \):
\[
f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2
\]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(-1) \):
\[
f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(0) \):
\[
f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1

Now, we sum the results of \( f(-2) \), \( f(-1) \), and \( f(0) \):
\[

"To determine how many positive integer divisors the number 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. We can do this by dividing 196 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we divide 196 by 2:
\[ 196 \div 2 = 98 \]
So, 196 is divisible by 2. We divide 98 by 2:
\[ 98 \div 2 = 49 \]
So, 98 is also divisible by 2. Now, we divide 49 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 49 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, which is 5. Since 49 is not divisible by 5, we move to the next prime number, which is 7. We divide 49 by 7:
\[ 49 \div 7 = 7 \]
So, 49 is divisible by 7. We divide 7 by 7:
\[ 7 \div 7 = 1 \]
So, 7 is also divisible by 7.

Thus, the prime factorization of 196 is:
\[ 196 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \]

To find the number of positive integer divisors of a number, we use the formula that involves adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results. For the number 196, the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each of these exponents gives us 3 and 3. Therefore, the number of positive integer divisors is:
\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

The positive integer divisors of 196 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196.

Thus, the number of positive integer divisors of 196 is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To determine which student has the highest average speed, we need to calculate the average speed for each student. The formula for average speed is given by:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

From the graph, we can see that each unit on the distance axis represents 1 unit and each unit on the time axis also represents 1 unit. Therefore, the total distance each student traveled is 6 units (from 0 to 6 on the distance axis), and the total time each student took is 8 units (from 0 to 8 on the time axis).

Using the formula, the average speed for each student is:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{6}{8} = 0.75 \text{ units per unit time}
\]

Since the average speed is the same for all students, we need to look at the individual distances traveled by each student to determine who traveled the farthest. The student who traveled the farthest will have the highest average speed.

From the graph, we can see the following distances traveled by each student:
- Evelyn: 4.5 units
- Briana: 2.2 units
- Carla: 5.2 units
- Debra: 2.8 units
- Angela: 1.4 units

Carla traveled the farthest distance of 5.2 units. Therefore, Carla has the highest average speed.

"To determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon, we start by understanding the relationship between the hexagon and the triangles. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, where each side of the hexagon is equal to the side of one of these equilateral triangles.

Given that the perimeter of one of these equilateral triangles is 21 inches, we can find the length of one side of the triangle. Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we divide the perimeter by 3:
\[
\text{Side length of the triangle} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon, each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches. A regular hexagon has six sides, so the perimeter of the hexagon is:
\[
\text{Perimeter of the hexagon} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ inches}

Therefore, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is \(\boxed{42}\) inches.","[42, '42']",42,"[42, '42']",True
"To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n+2 \). The sum of these three integers is:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect cube. Let's denote the perfect cube by \( k^3 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Therefore, we have:
\[
3(n+1) = k^3
\]
This implies that \( k^3 \) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is a prime number, \( k \) must also be divisible by 3. Let's write \( k \) as \( 3m \), where \( m \) is an integer. Substituting \( k = 3m \) into the equation, we get:
\[
3(n+1) = (3m)^3 = 27m^3
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
\[
n+1 = 9m^3
\]
Therefore, \( n = 9m^3 - 1 \). The three consecutive integers are \( n = 9m^3 - 1 \), \( n+1 = 9m^3 \), and \( n+2 = 9m^3 + 1 \). The sum of these three integers is:
\[
(9m^3 - 1) + 9m^3 + (9m^3 + 1) = 27m^3
\]
To find the smallest positive perfect cube, we take the smallest positive integer value for \( m \), which is 1. Substituting \( m = 1 \) into the expression for the sum, we get:
\[
27 \cdot 1^3 = 27

"To find the angle between the two lines given by the equations \(2x = 3y = -z\) and \(6x = -y = -4z\), we first need to determine the direction vectors of these lines.

For the line \(2x = 3y = -z\), we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\). Let \(2x = 3y = -z = t\). Then, we have:
\[x = \frac{t}{2}, \quad y = \frac{t}{3}, \quad z = -t.\]
The direction vector of this line is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)\).

For the line \(6x = -y = -4z\), we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(s\). Let \(6x = -y = -4z = s\). Then, we have:
\[x = \frac{s}{6}, \quad y = -s, \quad z = -\frac{s}{4}.\]
The direction vector of this line is \(\left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)\).

Next, we use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle \(\theta\) between the two direction vectors. The dot product of the vectors \(\mathbf{v}_1 = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2 = \left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)\) is:

Since the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal, and the angle \(\theta\) between them is \(90^\circ\).

Therefore, the angle between the two lines is \(\boxed{90}\).","[90, '90']",90^\circ,"[90, '90']",True
"To find the distance between the points \((2, -6)\) and \((-4, 3)\), we use the distance formula. The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a plane is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Here, the coordinates of the first point are \((x_1, y_1) = (2, -6)\) and the coordinates of the second point are \((x_2, y_2) = (-4, 3)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{((-4) - 2)^2 + (3 - (-6))^2}
\]

First, we simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:

\[
(-4) - 2 = -6
\]
\[
3 - (-6) = 3 + 6 = 9
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 9^2}

Next, we calculate the squares:

\[
(-6)^2 = 36
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]

Adding these values together, we get:

\[
36 + 81 = 117

So, the distance is:

\[
d = \sqrt{117}

We can simplify \(\sqrt{117}\) by factoring out the largest perfect square from 117:

\[
117 = 9 \times 13
\]
\[
\sqrt{117} = \sqrt{9 \times 13} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{13} = 3\sqrt{13}

"To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 30 and can be written using only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10. 

First, for a number to be a multiple of 10, it must end in 0. So, the number we are looking for must end in 0.

Next, for a number to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 2, the sum of its digits will be a multiple of 2 if the number of 2's is even. Therefore, the number must have an even number of 2's.

"To find the polynomial \( p(x) \) that satisfies \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we start by expressing \( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) in a more convenient form. Notice that:

However, \( q(x) \) is not a polynomial, so we need to find a polynomial \( p(x) \) that approximates \( q(x) \) at the given points. We can use the method of Lagrange interpolation to find such a polynomial. The Lagrange interpolation polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree at most 5 that passes through the points \( (2, \frac{2}{3}), (3, \frac{3}{8}), (4, \frac{4}{15}), (5, \frac{5}{24}), (6, \frac{6}{35}), (7, \frac{7}{48}) \) is given by:

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( p(x) \) can be written as a polynomial of degree 5 that matches the given values. We can use the method of undetermined coefficients or numerical methods to find the coefficients of \( p(x) \). Instead, we can use the fact that the polynomial \( p(x) \) can be written in the form:

\[
p(x) = \frac{a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0}{x^2 - 1}

We can find the coefficients \( a_5, a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \) by solving the system of equations:

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

First, we simplify the right side of the equation. The radius squared is \( 3^2 = 9 \), so the equation becomes:

"To determine the length of \( DE \) in the given right triangle \( \triangle DEF \), we start by noting that \( \angle EDF = 90^\circ \) and \( \sin D = 0.7 \). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to \( \angle D \) is \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DF \). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

We are given that the length of \( EF \) is 7. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \( DF \), we solve for \( DF \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then dividing by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \( DF \) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In \( \triangle DEF \), this gives:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \( DF = 10 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}

Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counter-clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   The translated complex number \( z' \) is given by:
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]
   So, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is \( 4 - 2i \).

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   The original position of \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \), so we add \( c \) to \( z'' \):
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To determine the minimum value of \( c \) for the function \( y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \) given the graph, we need to analyze the graph and identify the phase shift of the sine function.

The general form of the sine function is:
\[ y = a \sin (bx + c) + d \]
where:
- \( a \) is the amplitude,
- \( b \) affects the period,
- \( c \) is the phase shift,
- \( d \) is the vertical shift.

From the graph, we can observe the following:
1. The amplitude \( a \) is 2, as the maximum value of the function is 3 and the minimum value is -1. The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values:
   \[ a = \frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = 2 \]
2. The vertical shift \( d \) is 1, as the midline of the function is at \( y = 1 \):
   \[ d = \frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = 1 \]
3. The period of the function is \( \frac{2\pi}{b} \). From the graph, we can see that the function completes one full cycle (from one peak to the next peak) over an interval of \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \):
   \[ \frac{2\pi}{b} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \implies b = 3 \]
4. The phase shift \( c \) can be determined by looking at the horizontal shift of the sine function. The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) has its maximum value at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \). For the function \( y = 2 \sin (3x + c) + 1 \), the maximum value occurs when \( 3x + c = \frac{\pi}{2} \). From the graph, we can see that the maximum value occurs at \( x = 0 \):
   \[ 3(0) + c = \frac{\pi}{2} \implies c = \frac{\pi}{2} \]

"To solve for the angle \( x \) in the given geometric configuration, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles and the lines involved. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\overline{BC}\) is parallel to the line through point \(A\).
   - \(AB = BC\).
   - The angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\) is \(124^\circ\).

2. **Determine the angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\):**
   Since \(\overline{BC}\) is parallel to the line through point \(A\), the angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\) is the same as the angle formed by \(\overline{BC}\) and the line through \(A\). Therefore, the angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\) is \(124^\circ\).

3. **Find the angle at point \(B\) on the line segment \(\overline{BC}\):**
   Since \(AB = BC\), triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = BC\). The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). Let the angle at point \(B\) on the line segment \(\overline{BC}\) be \(y\). Then the other two angles in triangle \(ABC\) are equal, and each is \(\frac{180^\circ - y}{2}\).

4. **Relate the angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\) to the angle at point \(B\) on the line segment \(\overline{BC}\):**
   The angle at point \(B\) on the line through \(A\) is the exterior angle to the triangle \(ABC\) at point \(B\). The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of the triangle. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   124^\circ = \frac{180^\circ - y}{2} + \frac{180^\circ - y}{2} = 180^\circ - y
   \]
   Solving for \(y\):
   \[
   124^\circ = 180^\circ - y \implies y = 180^\circ - 124^\circ = 56^\circ
   \]

5. **Find the angle \(x\):**
   The angle \(x\) is the angle at point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{BC}\). Since triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = BC\), the angle at point \(C\) is also \(56^\circ\). Therefore, the angle \(x\) is:

"To find the minimum value of \(a\) such that all roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) are real, we start by considering the polynomial and its properties. Let the roots of the polynomial be \(r, s, t\). By Vieta's formulas, we know:

\[
r + s + t = -a,
\]
\[
rs + rt + st = a,
\]
\[
rst = -1.
\]

We need to find the minimum value of \(a\) such that \(r, s, t\) are all real. Let's assume \(r, s, t\) are real and try to express \(a\) in a form that allows us to find its minimum value.

First, we can use the identity for the sum of the roots and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. From the equations above, we have:

\[
a = -(r + s + t) = -(rs + rt + st) = -rst.
\]

Since \(rst = -1\), we have:

\[
a = -(-1) = 1.
\]

To verify that \(a = 1\) is indeed the minimum value, we substitute \(a = 1\) back into the polynomial:

\[
x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as follows:

\[
x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 + 1).
\]

The roots of the polynomial are the roots of the factors \(x + 1 = 0\) and \(x^2 + 1 = 0\). The root of \(x + 1 = 0\) is \(x = -1\), and the roots of \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) are \(x = i\) and \(x = -i\). Since the roots \(i\) and \(-i\) are not real, \(a = 1\) does not satisfy the condition that all roots are real.

Therefore, we need to find a value of \(a\) greater than 1 such that all roots are real. Let's consider the case where the roots are equal. If \(r = s = t\), then from Vieta's formulas, we have:

\[
3r = -a,
\]
\[
3r^2 = a,
\]
\[
r^3 = -1.
\]

From \(r^3 = -1\), we get \(r = -1\). Substituting \(r = -1\) into the other equations, we get:

\[
3(-1) = -a \implies a = 3,
\]
\[
3(-1)^2 = a \implies a = 3.
\]

Thus, \(a = 3\) is a value that satisfies the condition that all roots are real. To confirm that this is the minimum value, we need to check if there is any value of \(a\) less than 3 that can satisfy the condition. Since \(a = 1\) does not work and \(a = 3\) works, the minimum value of \(a\) is:

"To find the largest integer less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\), we start by considering the expression \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\). Since \(\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}\) is a positive number less than 1, \((\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) is a very small positive number. Therefore, \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\) is slightly less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\).

First, we expand \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
and
\[
(a - b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} (-b)^k
\]
Adding these two expansions, the terms with odd powers of \(b\) cancel out, leaving only the terms with even powers of \(b\):
\[
(a + b)^n + (a - b)^n = 2 \sum_{k=0, \text{ even}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
For \(a = \sqrt{7}\), \(b = \sqrt{5}\), and \(n = 6\), we have:
\[
(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6 = 2 \left( \binom{6}{0} (\sqrt{7})^6 + \binom{6}{2} (\sqrt{7})^4 (\sqrt{5})^2 + \binom{6}{4} (\sqrt{7})^2 (\sqrt{5})^4 + \binom{6}{6} (\sqrt{5})^6 \right)
\]
Calculating each term, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{0} (\sqrt{7})^6 = 1 \cdot 7^3 = 343
\]
\[
\binom{6}{2} (\sqrt{7})^4 (\sqrt{5})^2 = 15 \cdot 7^2 \cdot 5 = 15 \cdot 49 \cdot 5 = 3675
\]
\[
\binom{6}{4} (\sqrt{7})^2 (\sqrt{5})^4 = 15 \cdot 7 \cdot 5^2 = 15 \cdot 7 \cdot 25 = 2625
\]
\[
\binom{6}{6} (\sqrt{5})^6 = 1 \cdot 5^3 = 125
\]
Adding these values together, we get:
\[
343 + 3675 + 2625 + 125 = 6768
\]
Therefore,
\[
(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6 + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6 = 2 \cdot 6768 = 13536
\]
Since \((\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^6\) is a very small positive number, \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\) is slightly less than 13536. The largest integer less than 13536 is 13535. Thus, the largest integer less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the ratio of the reports ofデナリ andネイト remains the same after the changes in the number of dogs. Let's start by calculating the initial reports ofデナリ andネイト.

Initial reports:
-デナリ: \( 16 \) dogs
-ネイト: \( 12 \) dogs

The initial ratio of their reports is:
\[
\frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

After the changes:
-デナリ: \( 16 + 4x \) dogs
-ネイト: \( 12 - x \) dogs

We need to find \( x \) such that the new ratio of their reports is equal to the initial ratio:
\[
\frac{16 + 4x}{12 - x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

To solve this equation, we cross-multiply:
\[
3(16 + 4x) = 4(12 - x)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
48 + 12x = 48 - 4x
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by adding \( 4x \) to both sides:
\[
16x = 0
\]

Since \( x \neq 0 \), there is no solution to the equation. Therefore, the problem as stated has no valid solution under the given conditions.

However, if we re-evaluate the problem and consider the possibility that the changes could be in the other direction (i.e., more dogs forデナリ and fewer dogs forネイト), we can try the following:

-デナリ: \( 16 + x \) dogs
-ネイト: \( 12 + x \) dogs

The new ratio of their reports is:
\[
\frac{16 + x}{12 + x}
\]

We need this new ratio to be equal to the initial ratio:
\[
\frac{16 + x}{12 + x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
3(16 + x) = 4(12 + x)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtracting \( 48 \) from both sides:
\[
3x = 4x

Subtracting \( 3x \) from both sides:

     Simplifying inside the square root:

     1 = \sqrt{9} + 4

     Since \(\sqrt{9} = 3\):
     \[
     1 = 3 + 4

"To determine the minimum complex interest rate required for the investment to grow to at least \$66,200 after 3 years, we can use the formula for the future value of a series of payments (annuity):

\[ FV = P \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \]

where:
- \( FV \) is the future value of the investment,
- \( P \) is the annual payment,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

In this problem:
- \( FV = 66,200 \),
- \( P = 20,000 \),
- \( n = 3 \).

We need to find the minimum \( r \) such that:

\[ 66,200 = 20,000 \left( \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \right) \]

First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 20,000:

\[ \frac{66,200}{20,000} = \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \]

\[ 3.31 = \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \]

Next, we multiply both sides by \( r \):

\[ 3.31r = (1 + r)^3 - 1 \]

Now, we expand \( (1 + r)^3 \):

\[ (1 + r)^3 = 1 + 3r + 3r^2 + r^3 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 3.31r = 1 + 3r + 3r^2 + r^3 - 1 \]

\[ 3.31r = 3r + 3r^2 + r^3 \]

Rearranging terms to form a polynomial equation:

\[ r^3 + 3r^2 + 3r - 3.31r = 0 \]

\[ r^3 + 3r^2 - 0.31r = 0 \]

Factoring out \( r \):

\[ r(r^2 + 3r - 0.31) = 0 \]

This gives us one solution \( r = 0 \), which is not practical for an interest rate. We need to solve the quadratic equation:

\[ r^2 + 3r - 0.31 = 0 \]

We use the quadratic formula \( r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -0.31 \):

\[ r = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-0.31)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]

\[ r = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 1.24}}{2} \]

\[ r = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{10.24}}{2} \]

\[ r = \frac{-3 \pm 3.2}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ r = \frac{-3 + 3.2}{2} = \frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \]

\[ r = \frac{-3 - 3.2}{2} = \frac{-6.2}{2} = -3.1 \]

Since a negative interest rate is not practical, we discard \( r = -3.1 \). Therefore, the minimum complex interest rate is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of circular arrangements of 7 people:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). For 7 people, this is:
   \[
   (7-1)! = 6! = 720
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of circular arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:**
   Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 5 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 4 individuals) in a circle. The number of ways to arrange 5 blocks in a circle is:
   \[

"To determine the profit of the math club, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the items and then subtract the cost of rendering the items.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling each type of item:
- The revenue from selling the quiches is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Revenue from quiches} = \left(\frac{54}{3}\right) \times 1 = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ dollars}

- The revenue from selling the lapelels is calculated as follows:

Next, we sum these revenues to find the total revenue:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 18 + 40 + 35 = 93 \text{ dollars}

The cost of rendering the items is given as $15. Therefore, the profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the total revenue:

"To find the complex number obtained by rotating the complex number \(7 + 2i\) by \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin, we can use the properties of complex numbers. A complex number \(z = a + bi\) can be represented in the complex plane as a vector from the origin to the point \((a, b)\). Rotating this vector by \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying the complex number by \(i\).

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the complex number \(z = 7 + 2i\).
2. Multiply \(z\) by \(i\):
   \[
   z \cdot i = (7 + 2i) \cdot i

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 4 upper-level soldiers from 5. This is denoted as \( \binom{5}{4} \) and is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 8 lower-level soldiers from 10. This is denoted as \( \binom{10}{8} \) and is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{10}{8} = \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \frac{10!}{8!2!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2 \cdot 1} = 45

Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose the upper-level soldiers by the number of ways to choose the lower-level soldiers to get the total number of different teams:
\[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11

   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that three specific people (PIE, RO, TO) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat PIE, RO, and TO as a single block**: Since PIE, RO, and TO must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the PIO block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""people"" around a circular table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

"To find the 8th term of the geometric sequence \(\frac{125}{9}, \frac{25}{3}, 5, 3, \ldots\), we first need to identify the first term \(a\) and the common ratio \(r\).

The first term \(a\) is \(\frac{125}{9}\).

The common ratio \(r\) is the ratio of the second term to the first term:
\[
r = \frac{\frac{25}{3}}{\frac{125}{9}} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{125} = \frac{25 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 125} = \frac{225}{375} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}.
\]

For the 8th term (\(a_8\)), we substitute \(a = \frac{125}{9}\), \(r = \frac{3}{5}\), and \(n = 8\):
\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{7}.
\]

First, we calculate \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7\):
\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7 = \frac{3^7}{5^7} = \frac{2187}{78125}.
\]

Now, we substitute this back into the formula for \(a_8\):
\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{2187}{78125} = \frac{125 \cdot 2187}{9 \cdot 78125}.
\]

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(125 = 5^3\) and \(78125 = 5^7\), so:
\[
\frac{125}{78125} = \frac{5^3}{5^7} = \frac{1}{5^4} = \frac{1}{625}.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

Next, we simplify \(\frac{2187}{9}\):
\[
\frac{2187}{9} = 243.

So, we have:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To solve the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we will start by simplifying and expanding both sides of the equation.

First, let's expand each term:
\[

\]
\[
(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343,
\]
\[
(2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.
\]

Now, substitute these expansions into the original equation:
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.
\]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.
\]

Next, move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero:
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0,
\]
\[
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0.
\]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by -6:
\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0.
\]

To find the roots of this polynomial, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial is a factor of the constant term (-105) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 5, \pm 7, \pm 15, \pm 21, \pm 35, \pm 105 \).

Let's test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial. Start with \( x = 3 \):
\[
3^3 - 15 \cdot 3^2 + 71 \cdot 3 - 105 = 27 - 135 + 213 - 105 = 0.
\]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root.

We can now factor \( x - 3 \) out of the polynomial \( x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 \) using synthetic division or polynomial division. Using synthetic division:
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
  3 & 1 & -15 & 71 & -105 \\
    &   & 3  & -36 & 105 \\
  \hline
    & 1 & -12 & 35 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
The quotient is \( x^2 - 12x + 35 \). So, we can write:
\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35).
\]

Next, we factor \( x^2 - 12x + 35 \):
\[
x^2 - 12x + 35 = (x - 5)(x - 7).
\]

Therefore, the polynomial \( x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 \) can be factored as:
\[
(x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the roots:
\[

\]
\[
x - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 5,
\]
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7.

     So, we have:

   - Now, divide 132 by 96:

   - Finally, divide 36 by 24:
     \[
     36 \div 24 = 1 \quad \text{(quotient)}, \quad \text{remainder} = 36 - 1 \times 24 = 36 - 24 = 12

\[
\frac{96}{8} = 12 \text{ cm}

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct x-coordinate should be:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

But since \(x > 7\), we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or the problem itself. If the problem constraints are correct, then the correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7, which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Thus, the correct interpretation should be that the problem constraints are incorrect or the problem itself is incorrect. However, if we assume the problem constraints are correct, then the correct x-coordinate should be:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

But since \(x > 7\), the correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7, which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8\) and express the solution in the form \(a < x < b\), we will follow these steps:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}\), we start by rewriting the expression in a more convenient form.

First, note that:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + y^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 400}
\]
\[
\sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + x^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 900}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2 + 4100 - 1600 - 2500} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2 + 0} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}
\]

This can be interpreted geometrically. The terms \(\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 400}\), \(\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 900}\), and \(\sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}\) represent the distances from the point \((x, y)\) to the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((40, 50)\) respectively, plus 20, 30, and 0 respectively.

To minimize the expression, we need to find the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of these distances. The point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of the distances to the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((40, 50)\) is the Fermat point of the triangle formed by these points. However, since the points \((0, 0)\) and \((0, 0)\) are the same, the problem reduces to finding the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of the distances to the points \((0, 0)\) and \((40, 50)\).

The point that minimizes the sum of the distances to two points is the point on the line segment connecting the two points. Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the expression is the point on the line segment connecting \((0, 0)\) and \((40, 50)\).

The equation of the line segment connecting \((0, 0)\) and \((40, 50)\) is:
\[
y = \frac{5}{4}x
\]

We need to find the point \((x, y)\) on this line segment that minimizes the expression. Substituting \(y = \frac{5}{4}x\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{5}{4}x\right)^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{4}x - 50\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{25}{16}x^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{4}x - 50\right)^2}
\]
\[

\]

To find the minimum value, we can use calculus or numerical methods. However, we can also use the fact that the minimum value of the expression occurs when \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\sqrt{0^2 + 400} + \sqrt{0^2 + 900} + \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2} = 20 + 30 + 0 = 50

"To determine how far the boy is from the starting point after his walk, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the north-south direction and the east-west direction separately, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from the starting point.

1. **Calculate the net distance in the north-south direction:**
   - The boy walks south by \(\frac{1}{2}\) mile.
   - The boy then walks south by another \(\frac{1}{2}\) mile.
   - The total distance walked south is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\) mile.
   - Therefore, the net distance in the north-south direction is \(-1\) mile (since south is the negative direction).

2. **Calculate the net distance in the east-west direction:**

"To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots of the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are \( n \)-th roots of unity, we start by solving the equation. Let \( w = z^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \):

\[ w^2 + w + 1 = 0. \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \):

\[ w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

So, the solutions for \( w \) are:

\[ w = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Next, we need to find the corresponding values of \( z \). Since \( w = z^2 \), we have:

\[ z^2 = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad z^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

We recognize that \( \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the complex numbers \( e^{2\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{-2\pi i / 3} \), respectively. Therefore, the solutions for \( z \) are:

\[ z = e^{\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{2\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-\pi i / 3}, \quad z = e^{-2\pi i / 3}. \]

These are the 6th roots of unity, specifically \( e^{\pi i / 3}, e^{2\pi i / 3}, e^{4\pi i / 3}, e^{5\pi i / 3} \). To verify, we note that \( e^{4\pi i / 3} = e^{-2\pi i / 3} \) and \( e^{5\pi i / 3} = e^{-\pi i / 3} \).

Thus, the roots of the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are indeed 6th roots of unity. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots are \( n \)-th roots of unity is:

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and the sum \(a + b + c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\).
   We can factor the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0 \implies x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials.
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is less than the degree of \(Q(x)\), the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\).
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is equal to the degree of \(Q(x)\), the horizontal asymptote is \(y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)}\).
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is greater than the degree of \(Q(x)\), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   For the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), the degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

3. **Find the sum \(a + b + c\):**
   Now that we have \(a = 7\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 0\), we can find the sum:

2. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

After finding a bag with 53 coins, the total number of coins becomes \( 7x + 53 \). We need to re distribute the coins from the other 7 bags so that each bag has the same number of coins, and the total number of coins is at least 200.

First, let's find the number of coins in each of the 7 bags after re distribution. If we re distribute the coins, the number of coins in each bag will be \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \). Since the number of coins in each bag must be an integer, \( 7x + 53 \) must be divisible by 8.

We can express this condition as:
\[ 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \]
\[ 7x \equiv -53 \pmod{8} \]
\[ 7x \equiv -5 \pmod{8} \]
\[ 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \]

To solve for \( x \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8. The inverse of 7 modulo 8 is a number \( y \) such that:
\[ 7y \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \]

By testing values, we find that:
\[ 7 \cdot 7 = 49 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \]

So, the inverse of 7 modulo 8 is 7. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the congruence \( 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \) by 7:
\[ x \equiv 3 \cdot 7 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 21 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form:
\[ x = 8k + 5 \]

The smallest positive value for \( x \) is 5. Therefore, the smallest number of coins in each of the original 7 bags is 5. The total number of coins in the original 7 bags is:
\[ 7x = 7 \cdot 5 = 35 \]

The total number of coins after finding the bag with 53 coins is:
\[ 7x + 53 = 35 + 53 = 88 \]

After re distribution, the number of coins in each bag is:
\[ \frac{88}{8} = 11 \]

Since 11 is greater than 200/8, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the smallest number of coins in each of the original 7 bags is:

"To find the quotient when \(x^6 - 3\) is divided by \(x + 1\), we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Here, we will use synthetic division.

First, identify the root corresponding to the divisor \(x + 1\). The root is \(x = -1\).

Next, write down the coefficients of the polynomial \(x^6 - 3\). Since there are no \(x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2,\) or \(x\) terms, we include zeros for these coefficients. The coefficients are \(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3\).

Now, set up the synthetic division with \(x = -1\):

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the value inside the square root:

   \[

First, let's recall the values of the sine function for some common angles:
\[

Since we are looking for \(\sin(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}\), we consider the negative angle corresponding to \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), which is \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\). This angle lies within the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\).

(x-1) \cdot f(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17.
\]

First, let's denote the degree of \( f(x) \) by \( n \). The degree of the polynomial on the left-hand side of the equation is the sum of the degrees of \( (x-1) \) and \( f(x) \). Since the degree of \( (x-1) \) is 1, the degree of \( (x-1) \cdot f(x) \) is \( n + 1 \).

The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side of the equation is 4, because the highest degree term in \( 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 \) is \( 3x^4 \).

Since the degrees of the polynomials on both sides of the equation must be equal, we have:

Given that the sum of the first \( N \) positive odd numbers is 121, we can set up the equation:

First, let's find the magnitude of the complex number \(1-i\):

"To determine the number of students who participated in both MATHCOUNTS and Science Bowl, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( |A| \) be the number of students who participated in MATHCOUNTS.
- Let \( |B| \) be the number of students who participated in Science Bowl.
- Let \( |A \cup B| \) be the number of students who participated in either MATHCOUNTS or Science Bowl or both.
- Let \( |A \cap B| \) be the number of students who participated in both MATHCOUNTS and Science Bowl.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of students is 50.
- The number of students who participated in MATHCOUNTS is \( |A| = 28 \).
- The number of students who participated in Science Bowl is \( |B| = 21 \).
- The number of students who did not participate in either program is 6.

First, we calculate the number of students who participated in either MATHCOUNTS or Science Bowl or both. Since 6 students did not participate in either program, the number of students who participated in at least one program is:
\[ |A \cup B| = 50 - 6 = 44. \]

According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students who participated in either MATHCOUNTS or Science Bowl or both is given by:

Solving for \( |A \cap B| \):
\[ 44 = 49 - |A \cap B|, \]

"To determine the coefficients \( p, q, r \) such that the polynomial \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) is divisible by \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \), we start by finding the roots of the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \).

First, we use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term \(-1\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \(1\), which are \( \pm 1 \).

Testing \( x = 1 \):
\[
1^3 - 3 \cdot 1^2 + 4 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 - 3 + 4 - 1 = 1 \neq 0
\]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root.

Testing \( x = -1 \):
\[
(-1)^3 - 3 \cdot (-1)^2 + 4 \cdot (-1) - 1 = -1 - 3 - 4 - 1 = -9 \neq 0
\]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root.

Since neither \( x = 1 \) nor \( x = -1 \) is a root, we conclude that the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) has no rational roots. However, it must have three roots (which could be real or complex) that are the cube roots of unity shifted by some constant.

We can use polynomial division or synthetic division to find the roots, but a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the roots of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) are the cube roots of unity shifted by some constant. Let's denote the roots by \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Then, the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - \alpha)(x - \beta)(x - \gamma) \).

The polynomial \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) can be factored as \( (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)^3 \). Expanding this, we get:

Thus, the coefficients \( p, q, r \) are:

"To solve for the value of \(a\) given the polynomial equation \(8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\) with three distinct positive roots and the sum of the logarithms of the roots base 2 equal to 5, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the roots and their properties:**
   Let the roots of the polynomial be \(r_1, r_2,\) and \(r_3\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\), the sum of the roots taken one at a time (i.e., the sum of the roots) is given by:
   \[

   \[
   r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = \frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4}.
   \]
   The product of the roots is given by:
   \[
   r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.
   \]

2. **Use the given condition about the sum of the logarithms:**
   The sum of the logarithms of the roots base 2 is given by:
   \[
   \log_2 r_1 + \log_2 r_2 + \log_2 r_3 = 5.
   \]
   Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (xy) = \log_b x + \log_b y\), we can rewrite this as:
   \[
   \log_2 (r_1 r_2 r_3) = 5.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   r_1 r_2 r_3 = 2^5 = 32.
   \]
   From Vieta's formulas, we know that:
   \[
   r_1 r_2 r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To solve the problem, we start by factoring the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). We can use a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^4\). Then the polynomial becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):

\[y^2 + 3y - 4.\]

We can factor this quadratic polynomial as follows:

\[y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1).\]

Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we get:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1).\]

Next, we factor \(x^4 - 1\). Notice that \(x^4 - 1\) is a difference of squares:

\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1).\]

We can further factor \(x^2 - 1\) as another difference of squares:

\[x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1).\]

So, the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) can be written as:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\]

We need to check if these factors can be factored further over the integers. The polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over the integers because it has no real roots. The polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) can be factored as follows:

\[x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]

Both \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) and \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) are irreducible over the integers because their discriminants are negative:

\[\Delta = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4.\]

Thus, the factorization of \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible polynomials over the integers is:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1).\]

Now, we need to evaluate \(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_k(1)\), where \(p_i(1)\) is the value of the \(i\)-th irreducible polynomial at \(x = 1\). We calculate each value:

\[p_1(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2,\]
\[p_2(1) = 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5,\]
\[p_3(1) = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1,\]
\[p_4(1) = 1 + 1 = 2,\]
\[p_5(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

\[p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1) + p_5(1) = 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 10.\]

First, recall the identity for \(\sin 7x\):
\[
\sin 7x = 7 \sin x - 56 \sin^3 x + 112 \sin^5 x - 64 \sin^7 x.
\]
We can rearrange this to express \(\sin^7 x\) in terms of \(\sin x\) and higher odd powers of \(\sin x\):
\[
64 \sin^7 x = 7 \sin x - 56 \sin^3 x + 112 \sin^5 x - \sin 7x.
\]
Solving for \(\sin^7 x\), we get:
\[
\sin^7 x = \frac{7 \sin x - 56 \sin^3 x + 112 \sin^5 x - \sin 7x}{64}.
\]
Next, we need to express \(\sin^3 x\) and \(\sin^5 x\) in terms of \(\sin\) functions of multiple angles. Using the identity for \(\sin 3x\):
\[
\sin 3x = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x,
\]
we can solve for \(\sin^3 x\):
\[
4 \sin^3 x = 3 \sin x - \sin 3x \implies \sin^3 x = \frac{3 \sin x - \sin 3x}{4}.
\]
Using the identity for \(\sin 5x\):
\[
\sin 5x = 5 \sin x - 20 \sin^3 x + 16 \sin^5 x,
\]
we can solve for \(\sin^5 x\):
\[
16 \sin^5 x = 5 \sin x - 20 \sin^3 x - \sin 5x \implies \sin^5 x = \frac{5 \sin x - 20 \sin^3 x - \sin 5x}{16}.
\]
Substituting these expressions into the equation for \(\sin^7 x\), we get:
\[
\sin^7 x = \frac{7 \sin x - 56 \left( \frac{3 \sin x - \sin 3x}{4} \right) + 112 \left( \frac{5 \sin x - 20 \sin^3 x - \sin 5x}{16} \right) - \sin 7x}{64}.
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the numerator:
\[
\sin^7 x = \frac{7 \sin x - 14 (3 \sin x - \sin 3x) + 7 (5 \sin x - 20 \sin^3 x - \sin 5x) - \sin 7x}{64} = \frac{7 \sin x - 42 \sin x + 14 \sin 3x + 35 \sin x - 140 \sin^3 x - 7 \sin 5x - \sin 7x}{64} = \frac{-140 \sin^3 x + 14 \sin 3x - 7 \sin 5x - \sin 7x}{64}.
\]
Since we are only interested in the coefficient of \(\sin x\), we see that the term \(-140 \sin^3 x\) does not contribute to the coefficient of \(\sin x\). Therefore, the coefficient \(d\) of \(\sin x\) in the original equation is:
\[
d = \frac{-1}{64} \cdot (-140) = \frac{140}{64} = \frac{35}{16}.

1. **Define the original side length of the square:**
   Let the original side length of the square be \( s \).

2. **Calculate the original area of the square:**
   The area of the original square is:
   \[
   A_{\text{original}} = s^2
   \]

3. **Determine the new side lengths after the changes:**
   - The two opposite sides decrease by \( 40\% \). Therefore, the new length of these sides is:
     \[
     s_{\text{new}} = s \times (1 - 0.4) = 0.6s
     \]
   - The other two opposite sides increase by \( 50\% \). Therefore, the new length of these sides is:
     \[
     s_{\text{new}} = s \times (1 + 0.5) = 1.5s

4. **Calculate the area of the new rectangle:**
   The area of the new rectangle is the product of the new side lengths:
   \[
   A_{\text{new}} = (0.6s) \times (1.5s) = 0.9s^2

5. **Determine the decrease in area:**
   The decrease in area is the difference between the original area and the new area:
   \[

"To solve the equation \(\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan x^\circ\), we start by using the tangent addition formula for three angles. The formula states that for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + B + C = 180^\circ\), the following identity holds:

\[
\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C.
\]

In our problem, we can identify \(A = 53^\circ\), \(B = 81^\circ\), and \(C = x^\circ\). Since \(53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ\), it follows that \(x = 46^\circ\). Therefore, we can substitute \(A = 53^\circ\), \(B = 81^\circ\), and \(C = 46^\circ\) into the identity:

\[
\tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan 46^\circ = \tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan 46^\circ.

This matches the given equation \(\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan x^\circ\). Therefore, the value of \(x\) is

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:

"To find the radius of a sphere where the volume and surface area are numerically equal, we start by using the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ A = 4 \pi r^2 \]

We are given that the volume and surface area are numerically equal, so we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = 4 \pi r^2 \]

To solve for \( r \), we first eliminate the common factors on both sides of the equation. We can divide both sides by \( 4 \pi \):

\[ \frac{1}{3} r^3 = r^2 \]

Next, we eliminate \( r^2 \) from both sides by dividing both sides by \( r^2 \) (assuming \( r \neq 0 \)):

\[
9 \& 2 = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2 + 9}}{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2 - 2}}

First, we calculate the numerator:

\[
9 \cdot 2 + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27

So, the numerator is \(\sqrt{27}\). We can simplify \(\sqrt{27}\) as follows:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

First, let's list the numbers on each die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The product of the numbers on the two dice will be a multiple of 5 if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 5. Since the only multiple of 5 on a six-sided die is 5 itself, we need to find the probability that at least one of the dice shows a 5.

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is:
\[6 \times 6 = 36.\]

Next, we count the number of outcomes where the product is not a multiple of 5. This happens if neither die shows a 5. The possible outcomes for each die in this case are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5 is:
\[5 \times 5 = 25.\]

The number of outcomes where the product is a multiple of 5 is the total number of outcomes minus the number of outcomes where the product is not a multiple of 5:
\[36 - 25 = 11.\]

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) for which the function \(\log x^2\) has a domain of \(x < a\) or \(x > b\), we need to analyze the expression inside the logarithm and the properties of the logarithmic function.

The function \(\log x^2\) is defined if and only if the argument of the logarithm, \(x^2\), is positive. This is because the logarithm function is only defined for positive real numbers. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality \(x^2 > 0\).

The inequality \(x^2 > 0\) holds for all real numbers except \(x = 0\). In other words, \(x\) can be any real number except 0. This means the domain of the function \(\log x^2\) is all real numbers except 0.

We are given that the domain of \(\log x^2\) is \(x < a\) or \(x > b\). This implies that the values of \(a\) and \(b\) must be such that the set of all real numbers except 0 is equivalent to the union of the intervals \((-\infty, a)\) and \((b, \infty)\).

The only way to achieve this is if \(a\) and \(b\) are the endpoints of the interval that is not included in the domain, which is the point \(x = 0\). Therefore, \(a\) and \(b\) must be such that one of them is less than 0 and the other is greater than 0. Without loss of generality, we can choose \(a = -\infty\) and \(b = \infty\), but since we are asked to find a finite sum \(a + b\), we need to consider the next logical choice, which is \(a = -1\) and \(b = 1\).

First, we compute \(f(a)\):

\[ f(a) = a^3 + 3a^2 + 1. \]

Next, we substitute \(f(x)\) and \(f(a)\) into the given equation:

\[ x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 1) = (x - a)^2 (x - b). \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2 = (x - a)^2 (x - b). \]

We expand the right side:

\[ (x - a)^2 (x - b) = (x^2 - 2ax + a^2)(x - b) = x^3 - bx^2 - 2ax^2 + 2abx + a^2x - a^2b = x^3 + (-b - 2a)x^2 + (2ab + a^2)x - a^2b. \]

"To solve the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\) for exactly one real solution in the interval \([-500, 500]\), we start by simplifying the equation using the properties of logarithms. The equation can be rewritten as:

\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2)

Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:

\[

Rearranging terms to form a quadratic equation, we have:

\[

For this quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = 4-k\), and \(c = 4\), so the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16

Setting the discriminant equal to zero, we get:

\[
(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0

This can be factored as:

So, the solutions are:

\[
k = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad k = 8

However, \(k = 0\) is not a valid solution because it would make the original equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\) undefined. Therefore, the only valid solution is \(k = 8\).

Next, we need to check if \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution in the interval \([-500, 500]\). Substituting \(k = 8\) into the quadratic equation, we get:

The solution to this equation is:

\[

Since \(x = 2\) is within the interval \([-500, 500]\), \(k = 8\) indeed gives exactly one real solution in the interval.

(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

The answer is:

"To determine the radius of the circular base of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which water is entering the tank and the rate at which the water level is rising.

First, let's denote the radius of the circular base of the tank by \( r \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the tank at any given time is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h, \]
where \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank.

We are given that water is entering the tank at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

To find the relationship between these rates, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}. \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4. \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2. \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5. \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5}. \]

Therefore, the radius of the circular base of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the number of different combinations of 1 coin, 1 coin, and 1 coin that can be formed, we need to consider the number of choices available for each type of coin. Since we are forming a combination of 1 coin, 1 coin, and 1 coin, we need to count the number of ways to choose 3 coins from the total number of coins available.

First, let's identify the number of choices for each type of coin:
- There are 5 types of coins.
- There are 6 types of coins.
- There are 8 types of coins.

Since we are forming a combination of 1 coin, 1 coin, and 1 coin, we need to count the number of ways to choose 3 coins from the total number of coins available. This is given by the product of the number of choices for each type of coin.

The number of different combinations is calculated as follows:
\[
5 \times 6 \times 8
\]

First, we multiply 5 and 6:
\[
5 \times 6 = 30
\]

Next, we multiply the result by 8:
\[
30 \times 8 = 240
\]

Therefore, the number of different combinations of 1 coin, 1 coin, and 1 coin that can be formed is \(\boxed{240}\).","[240, '240']",240,"[240, '240']",True
"To solve the equation \( |5x-1| = x+3 \) and find the maximum value of \( x \), we need to consider the definition of the absolute value function. The equation \( |5x-1| = x+3 \) can be broken down into two separate cases:

1. \( 5x - 1 = x + 3 \)
2. \( -(5x - 1) = x + 3 \)

Let's solve each case separately.

**Case 1: \( 5x - 1 = x + 3 \)**

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 4x - 1 = 3 \]

Add 1 to both sides:
\[ 4x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 1 \]

**Case 2: \( -(5x - 1) = x + 3 \)**

Simplify the left side:
\[ -5x + 1 = x + 3 \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ -6x + 1 = 3 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ -6x = 2 \]

Divide both sides by -6:
\[ x = -\frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we have two potential solutions: \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \). However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation \( |5x-1| = x+3 \).

For \( x = 1 \):
\[ |5(1) - 1| = |4| = 4 \]
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is a valid solution.

For \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \):
\[ \left| 5\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - 1 \right| = \left| -\frac{5}{3} - 1 \right| = \left| -\frac{8}{3} \right| = \frac{8}{3} \]
\[ -\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{-1 + 9}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \]
So, \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is also a valid solution.

The maximum value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is \( x = 1 \).

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and ensure that there are no gaps in the range of \(f(x)\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

First, let's consider the behavior of \(f(x)\) on each interval.

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
So, the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). The range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) depends on the sign of \(a\):
- If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing, and the range is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing, and the range is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) on both intervals must cover all real numbers. This means that the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) must be a subset of the range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) or vice versa.

Let's consider the two cases:

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) and the range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
  \[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
  Factoring out \(a\), we have:
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
  Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \leq -1\) or \(a \geq 2\). Since \(a > 0\), we have:
  \[ a \geq 2. \]

- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\) and the range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
  \[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
  Factoring out \(a\), we have:
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
  Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(-1 \leq a \leq 2\). Since \(a < 0\), we have:
  \[ -1 \leq a < 0. \]

Combining the results from both cases, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers \(3339\), \(2961\), and \(1491\), we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

First, let's find the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\).

1. Divide \(3339\) by \(2961\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   3339 \div 2961 \approx 1.126 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   3339 - 1 \cdot 2961 = 3339 - 2961 = 378
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(378\).

2. Now, we need to find the GCD of \(2961\) and \(378\).
   \[
   2961 \div 378 \approx 7.85 \quad \text{(integer part is 7)}
   \]
   \[
   2961 - 7 \cdot 378 = 2961 - 2646 = 315
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(315\).

3. Next, we find the GCD of \(378\) and \(315\).
   \[
   378 \div 315 \approx 1.2 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   378 - 1 \cdot 315 = 378 - 315 = 63
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(63\).

4. Now, we find the GCD of \(315\) and \(63\).
   \[
   315 \div 63 = 5 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
   \]
   \[
   315 - 5 \cdot 63 = 315 - 315 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\) is \(63\).

Next, we need to find the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\).

1. Divide \(1491\) by \(63\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   1491 \div 63 \approx 23.5714 \quad \text{(integer part is 23)}
   \]
   \[
   1491 - 23 \cdot 63 = 1491 - 1449 = 42
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(42\).

2. Now, we find the GCD of \(63\) and \(42\).
   \[
   63 \div 42 \approx 1.5 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   63 - 1 \cdot 42 = 63 - 42 = 21
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(21\).

3. Next, we find the GCD of \(42\) and \(21\).
   \[
   42 \div 21 = 2 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
   \]
   \[
   42 - 2 \cdot 21 = 42 - 42 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\) is \(21\).

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of \(3339\), \(2961\), and \(1491\) is \(\boxed{21}\).","[21, '21']",21,"[21, '21']",True

2. The denominator must not be zero.

Let's analyze these conditions step by step.

### Condition 1: The expression inside the square root must be non-negative
The expression inside the square root is \( x - 1 \). For the square root to be defined and real, we need:
\[ x - 1 \geq 0 \]
\[ x \geq 1 \]

### Condition 2: The denominator must not be zero
The denominator of the function is \( x - 2 \). For the function to be defined, we need:
\[ x - 2 \neq 0 \]
\[ x \neq 2 \]

### Combining the conditions
Combining these two conditions, we get:
\[ x \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 2 \]

"To determine the probability that exactly 4 out of 7 islands have a treasure, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of trials (islands),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (islands with treasure),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on an individual trial,
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

In this problem, \( n = 7 \), \( k = 4 \), and \( p = \frac{1}{5} \). The probability of failure (an island not having treasure) is \( 1 - p = \frac{4}{5} \).

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{7}{4} \):

\[ \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{4! \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate \( p^k \) and \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):

\[ p^4 = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625} \]
\[ (1-p)^{7-4} = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125} \]

Now, we substitute these values into the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = 35 \times \frac{1}{625} \times \frac{64}{125} = 35 \times \frac{64}{78125} = \frac{2240}{78125} \]

"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle.

Given that the radius \( r \) is 1, the standard form of the equation becomes \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1\).

Let's start by completing the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the given equation.

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
   \]

2. Move the constant term \( c \) to the other side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]

3. Complete the square for the \( x \)-terms. To do this, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). Add and subtract this square inside the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]

4. Complete the square for the \( y \)-terms. To do this, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). Add and subtract this square inside the equation:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = -c
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 = -c
   \]

5. Combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 = -c
   \]

6. Move the constant term \(-34\) to the other side of the equation:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]

Now, the equation is in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((h, k) = (5, -3)\) and the radius \( r = \sqrt{34 - c} \). Since we know the radius is 1, we can set up the equation:
\[
\sqrt{34 - c} = 1
\]

7. Square both sides to solve for \( c \):
   \[
   34 - c = 1
   \]

8. Subtract 34 from both sides:
   \[
   -c = 1 - 34
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   -c = -33

9. Multiply both sides by \(-1\):

"To determine the measure of angle \(AFD\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

First, we know that angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are each divided into three equal parts. Let's denote the measure of angle \(BAD\) as \(3x\) and the measure of angle \(CDA\) as \(3y\). From the problem, we know that:
\[3x = 110^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad 3y = 100^\circ.\]
Solving for \(x\) and \(y\), we get:
\[x = \frac{110^\circ}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{100^\circ}{3}.\]

Next, we need to find the measure of angle \(AFD\). Notice that angle \(AFD\) is the sum of angles \(AEF\) and \(EDF\). Since \(E\) is the point where the angle bisectors of \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) intersect, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \(E\) is \(360^\circ\).

The angles around point \(E\) can be broken down as follows:
\[ \angle AEB + \angle BEC + \angle CED + \angle DEA = 360^\circ. \]
Since \(E\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors, we have:
\[ \angle AEB = 180^\circ - \frac{3x}{2} - \frac{3y}{2} = 180^\circ - \frac{3(110^\circ + 100^\circ)}{6} = 180^\circ - 105^\circ = 75^\circ. \]
Thus, the measure of angle \(AFD\) is:
\[ \angle AFD = 180^\circ - \angle AEB = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ. \]

Therefore, the measure of angle \(AFD\) is:

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

First, we compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
\]

Next, we compute \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2 \cdot 1 + y \cdot (-2) + (-5) \cdot 1 = 2 - 2y - 5 = -3 - 2y
\]

Using the projection formula, we get:

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \mathbf{u} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{-2(-3 - 2y)}{6} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{6 + 4y}{6} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{3 + 2y}{3} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix}
\]

We are given that this projection is equal to \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{5}{6} \\ -\frac{10}{6} \\ \frac{5}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{5}{6} \\ -\frac{5}{3} \\ \frac{5}{6} \end{pmatrix}
\]

By comparing the corresponding components of the two vectors, we get:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}, \quad \frac{3 + 2y}{3} = -\frac{5}{3}, \quad \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}

We can solve any of these equations for \( y \). Let's solve the first equation:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:

\[
-3 - 2y = 5
\]

Add 3 to both sides:

\[
-2y = 8

Divide both sides by -2:

\[

To verify, we can substitute \( y = -4 \) into the other equations:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}\), we will first simplify each term and then find a common denominator to combine them.

First, let's rewrite each term in a more convenient form:
\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)},
\]
\[
\frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 15}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)},
\]
\[
\frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{2(x^2 - 2x - 35)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{2x^2 - 4x - 70}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)}.
\]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The common denominator is \(5 \cdot 9 \cdot 13 \cdot (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) = 585(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)\).

However, instead of expanding the common denominator, we can use a substitution to simplify the equation. Let \(y = x^2 - 2x\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{y - 3}{5(y - 8)} + \frac{y - 15}{9(y - 24)} - \frac{2(y - 35)}{13(y - 48)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

We can further simplify this by finding a common denominator for the fractions on the left-hand side. The common denominator is \(5 \cdot 9 \cdot 13 \cdot (y-8)(y-24)(y-48) = 585(y-8)(y-24)(y-48)\).

However, a simpler approach is to test some possible values of \(x\) that might simplify the equation. Let's test \(x = 1\):

"To determine the direction in which Fibonacci scales are facing after a 2250-degree rotation, we need to understand how rotations affect the direction of the scales. A full rotation is 360 degrees, so we can find the equivalent rotation within one full circle by taking the remainder of 2250 divided by 360.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 2250 \div 360 = 6.25 \]
The integer part of the quotient is 6, which means that 2250 degrees is equivalent to:
\[ 2250 - 6 \times 360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]
So, a 2250-degree rotation is the same as a 90-degree rotation.

Next, we need to determine the direction of the scales after a 90-degree rotation. We start with the scales facing north. A 90-degree counterclockwise rotation from north will bring the scales to face west. A 90-degree clockwise rotation from north will bring the scales to face east. A 180-degree rotation from north will bring the scales to face south.

Since a 90-degree rotation is a quarter turn, it will bring the scales to face west.

Therefore, the direction in which the Fibonacci scales are facing after a 2250-degree rotation is \(\boxed{\text{west}}\).","[west, '\\text{west}']",\text{east},[],False

First, let's denote \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\).

### Step 1: Use the dot product condition
The dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y + 1 \cdot z = x + y + z
\]
We know that \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2\), so:
\[
x + y + z = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Step 2: Use the cross product condition
The cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot y) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot x) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot y - 1 \cdot x) = \begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix}
\]
We know that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), so:
\[
z - y = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]
\[
x - z = -2 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
y - x = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

### Step 3: Solve the system of equations
We have the following system of linear equations:
1. \(x + y + z = 2\)
2. \(z - y = 1\)
3. \(x - z = -2\)
4. \(y - x = 1\)

From Equation 4, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
y = x + 1
\]

From Equation 3, we can express \(z\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
z = x + 2
\]

Substitute \(y = x + 1\) and \(z = x + 2\) into Equation 1:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 2
\]
\[
3x + 3 = 2
\]
\[
3x = -1
\]
\[
x = -\frac{1}{3}
\]

Now substitute \(x = -\frac{1}{3}\) back into the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\):
\[
y = -\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
z = -\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Therefore, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{2}{3} \\ \frac{5}{3} \end{pmatrix}

"To determine the measure of \(\alpha\) in the given hexagon that is inscribed in a circle, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is \(720^\circ\). Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, it is a cyclic hexagon, and the opposite angles of a cyclic hexagon sum to \(180^\circ\).

Given the angles:
- \(\angle pF = 105^\circ\)
- \(\angle pB = 110^\circ\)

We need to find the measure of \(\alpha\). Let's denote the other angles of the hexagon as follows:
- \(\angle pC = x\)
- \(\angle pD = y\)
- \(\angle pE = z\)

Since the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is \(720^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle pA + \angle pB + \angle pC + \angle pD + \angle pE + \angle pF = 720^\circ
\]

We know \(\angle pB = 110^\circ\) and \(\angle pF = 105^\circ\), so:
\[
\angle pA + x + y + z + 110^\circ + 105^\circ = 720^\circ
\]
\[
\angle pA + x + y + z + 215^\circ = 720^\circ
\]
\[
\angle pA + x + y + z = 505^\circ
\]

Since the hexagon is cyclic, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle pA + \angle pD = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle pB + \angle pE = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle pC + \angle pF = 180^\circ
\]

We already know \(\angle pB = 110^\circ\), so:
\[
\angle pE = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

We also know \(\angle pF = 105^\circ\), so:
\[
\angle pC = 180^\circ - 105^\circ = 75^\circ
\]

Now, we substitute \(\angle pC = 75^\circ\) into the equation \(\angle pA + x + y + z = 505^\circ\):
\[
\angle pA + 75^\circ + y + z = 505^\circ
\]
\[
\angle pA + y + z = 430^\circ
\]

Since \(\angle pA + \angle pD = 180^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle pD = 180^\circ - \angle pA
\]

And since \(\angle pE = 70^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle pD = y + 70^\circ
\]

Therefore:
\[
180^\circ - \angle pA = y + 70^\circ
\]
\[
y = 110^\circ - \angle pA
\]

Substituting \(y = 110^\circ - \angle pA\) into the equation \(\angle pA + y + z = 430^\circ\):
\[
\angle pA + (110^\circ - \angle pA) + z = 430^\circ
\]
\[
110^\circ + z = 430^\circ
\]
\[
z = 320^\circ
\]

Since \(\angle pE = 70^\circ\), we have:
\[
\alpha = \angle pE = 70^\circ

Thus, the measure of \(\alpha\) is \(\boxed{70}\).","[70, '70']",145^\circ,"[145, '145']",False
"To solve the given equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), we start by rewriting it as:
\[
x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}.
\]
Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get:
\[
x = \omega (13x - 1),
\]
where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). This can be rearranged to:
\[
x - \omega (13x - 1) = 0 \implies x (1 - 13\omega) = \omega \implies x = \frac{\omega}{1 - 13\omega}.
\]
The 10th roots of \(-1\) are given by \(\omega = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\). Therefore, the roots of the equation are:
\[
x_k = \frac{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}.
\]
We need to find the sum:
\[
\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3\overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4\overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}.
\]
First, note that for any complex number \(r\), \(r\overline{r} = |r|^2\). Therefore, we need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of the roots. The magnitude squared of \(x_k\) is:
\[
|x_k|^2 = \left| \frac{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{|1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}|^2}.
\]
Thus, the sum we need to find is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{|1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}|^2}{1}.
\]
We can simplify \(|1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}|^2\):
\[
|1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}|^2 = (1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10})(1 - 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}) = 1 - 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10} - 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10} + 169 = 170 - 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right).
\]
Therefore, the sum becomes:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4} \left( 170 - 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right) \right) = \sum_{k=0}^{4} 170 - 26 \sum_{k=0}^{4} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right).
\]
The first sum is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4} 170 = 170 \times 5 = 850.
\]
The second sum is the sum of cosines of 5 equally spaced angles around the unit circle, which is zero:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right) = 0.

Therefore, the sum is:
\[
850 - 26 \times 0 = 850.
\]
Thus, the value is:

"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is also satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) exists for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(x_0\) be such an \(x\). Then \(f(x_0) \neq x_0\) and \(f(f(x_0)) = x_0\). Let \(y_0 = f(x_0)\). Then \(f(y_0) = x_0\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
y_0 = \lambda x_0 (1 - x_0) \quad \text{and} \quad x_0 = \lambda y_0 (1 - y_0).
\]
Substituting \(y_0\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x_0 = \lambda (\lambda x_0 (1 - x_0))(1 - \lambda x_0 (1 - x_0)) = \lambda^2 x_0 (1 - x_0)(1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2).
\]
Since \(x_0 \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x_0\):
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - x_0)(1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2 - x_0 + \lambda x_0^2 - \lambda^2 x_0^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x_0 + \lambda (2x_0^2 - \lambda x_0^3)).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x_0 + \lambda^3 (2x_0^2 - \lambda x_0^3).
\]
Since \(x_0 = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we substitute \(x_0\) into the equation:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3\right).
\]
Simplifying the terms, we get:

1 = \lambda^2 - (\lambda + 1)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3}\right) = \lambda^2 - (\lambda^2 - 1) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^2}\right).
\]
\[
1 = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{2(\lambda - 1)^2 - (\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^2}\right) = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (2 - (\lambda - 1))}{\lambda^2}\right) = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (3 - \lambda)}{\lambda^2}\right).

"To find the points of intersection of the two circles given by the equations \(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0\) and \(x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0\), we start by rewriting each equation in standard form.

First, we complete the square for the first equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0
\]
\[
(x^2 + 6x + 9) + (y^2 - 24y + 144) = -72 + 9 + 144
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81
\]
This is a circle with center \((-3, 12)\) and radius \(9\).

Next, we complete the square for the second equation:
\[
x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0
\]
\[
(x^2 + 6x + 9) - (y^2 - 16y + 64) = -46 + 9 - 64
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -101
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 101
\]
This is a circle with center \((-3, 8)\) and radius \(\sqrt{101}\).

Now, we need to find the points of intersection of these two circles. We subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46) - (x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72) = 0
\]
\[
-2y^2 + 40y - 118 = 0
\]
\[
y^2 - 20y + 59 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
y = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 236}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{164}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{20 \pm 2\sqrt{41}}{2}
\]
\[
y = 10 \pm \sqrt{41}
\]
So, the \(y\)-coordinates of the intersection points are \(y_1 = 10 + \sqrt{41}\) and \(y_2 = 10 - \sqrt{41}\).

We substitute these \(y\)-values back into the equation of the first circle to find the corresponding \(x\)-coordinates. Using the first circle's equation:
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81
\]
For \(y_1 = 10 + \sqrt{41}\):
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41} - 12)^2 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (-2 + \sqrt{41})^2 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + 4 - 4\sqrt{41} + 41 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + 45 - 4\sqrt{41} = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 = 36 + 4\sqrt{41}
\]
\[
x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41}}
\]
\[
x = -3 \pm \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41}}
\]
So, the intersection points are:
\[
\left(-3 + \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left(-3 - \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right)
\]

For \(y_2 = 10 - \sqrt{41}\):
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 12)^2 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (-2 - \sqrt{41})^2 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + 4 + 4\sqrt{41} + 41 = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 + 45 + 4\sqrt{41} = 81
\]
\[
(x + 3)^2 = 36 - 4\sqrt{41}
\]
\[
x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}
\]
\[
x = -3 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}
\]
So, the intersection points are:
\[
\left(-3 + \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left(-3 - \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right)

For the point \(\left(-3 - \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right)\):
\[
d = \sqrt{\left(-3 - \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}} + 3\right)^2 + \left(10 - \sqrt{41} - 2\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(-\sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}}\right)^2 + \left(8 - \sqrt{41}\right)^2} = \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41} + 64 - 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{141 - 20\sqrt{41}}

   - The degree of the denominator \( 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \) is 3.

2. Compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers that are at least 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than 0, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the set of all prime numbers that are at least 30.
2. Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than 0.
3. Find the intersection of these two sets.

First, let's list the prime numbers that are at least 30. The smallest prime number greater than or equal to 30 is 31. The next prime number is 37, followed by 41, 43, 47, and so on. Therefore, the set of all prime numbers that are at least 30 is:

Next, let's list the set of all odd numbers greater than 0. This set includes all positive integers that are not divisible by 2:
\[ \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, \ldots\} \]

"To find the value of \( k \) for which the ellipse \( kx^2 + y^2 = 1 \) has two points of tangency with the \( x \)-axis, we start by analyzing the given ellipse and its properties.

The standard form of the ellipse is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where \( a^2 = \frac{1}{k} \) and \( b^2 = 1 \). Therefore, the ellipse is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{\frac{1}{k}} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad kx^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

The foci of the ellipse are located at \( (\pm c, 0) \), where \( c = \sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} \). Thus, the foci are \( F_1 = \left( -\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}}, 0 \right) \) and \( F_2 = \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}}, 0 \right) \).

We need to find the value of \( k \) such that there are two points of tangency with the \( x \)-axis. These points of tangency will be symmetric about the \( y \)-axis and will have coordinates \( (x_0, 0) \) and \( (-x_0, 0) \).

The distance from the center of the ellipse to each point of tangency is \( x_0 \). The distance from each point of tangency to each focus is \( \sqrt{x_0^2 + c^2} = \sqrt{x_0^2 + 1 - \frac{1}{k}} \).

Since the points of tangency are points of tangency, the distance from each point of tangency to each focus is equal to the distance from the center of the ellipse to each focus plus the distance from the center of the ellipse to the point of tangency. Therefore, we have:
\[
\sqrt{x_0^2 + 1 - \frac{1}{k}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} + x_0
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x_0^2 + 1 - \frac{1}{k} = 1 - \frac{1}{k} + 2x_0\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} + x_0^2
\]

Subtracting \( x_0^2 + 1 - \frac{1}{k} \) from both sides, we obtain:
\[
0 = 2x_0\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}}
\]

Since \( x_0 \neq 0 \) (the points of tangency are not at the center), we have:
\[
2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} = 0
\]

This equation is not possible unless \( k = 1 \), but \( k > 1 \) by the problem statement. Therefore, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation is that the distance from the center of the ellipse to each point of tangency is equal to the distance from the center of the ellipse to each focus, which is \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} \).

Thus, the correct value of \( k \) is:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) to rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 5^\circ}{-2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 5^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 5^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ} = -\cot 5^\circ = -\tan 85^\circ.

"Given the sequence \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\) with the properties that for any positive integer \(k\), the subsequence \(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\) is an equilateral sequence and the subsequence \(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\) is an arithmetic sequence, we need to find \(a_1\) given that \(a_{13} = 2016\).

First, let's express the terms of the sequence in terms of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\). Since \(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\) is an equilateral sequence, we have:
\[a_{2k+1} = 2a_{2k} - a_{2k-1}.\]
And since \(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\) is an arithmetic sequence, we have:
\[a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}.\]

Let's start with the first few terms:
\[a_1 = a_1,\]
\[a_2 = a_2,\]
\[a_3 = 2a_2 - a_1,\]
\[a_4 = 2(2a_2 - a_1) - a_2 = 3a_2 - 2a_1,\]
\[a_5 = 2(3a_2 - 2a_1) - (2a_2 - a_1) = 4a_2 - 3a_1,\]
\[a_6 = 2(4a_2 - 3a_1) - (3a_2 - 2a_1) = 5a_2 - 4a_1.\]

We observe a pattern:
\[a_{2k-1} = ka_2 - (k-1)a_1,\]
\[a_{2k} = (k+1)a_2 - ka_1.\]

To find \(a_{13}\), we note that \(13\) is odd, so \(a_{13} = a_7\). Using the pattern, we have:
\[a_7 = 7a_2 - 6a_1.\]
We are given that \(a_{13} = 2016\), so:
\[7a_2 - 6a_1 = 2016.\]

To find \(a_1\), we need another equation involving \(a_1\) and \(a_2\). We can use the fact that \(a_6 = 5a_2 - 4a_1\) and \(a_8 = 8a_2 - 7a_1\). However, we only need the first equation to solve for \(a_1\) in terms of \(a_2\):
\[a_2 = \frac{2016 + 6a_1}{7}.\]

Since \(a_2\) must be an integer, \(2016 + 6a_1\) must be divisible by 7. We know that \(2016 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), so:
\[6a_1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}.\]
Since 6 and 7 are coprime, \(a_1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, \(a_1 = 7k\) for some integer \(k\).

Substituting \(a_1 = 7k\) into the equation \(7a_2 - 6a_1 = 2016\), we get:
\[7a_2 - 6(7k) = 2016,\]
\[7a_2 - 42k = 2016,\]
\[a_2 - 6k = 288,\]
\[a_2 = 288 + 6k.\]

Since \(a_2\) must be an integer, \(k\) can be any integer. To find the smallest positive \(a_1\), we choose \(k = 1\):
\[a_1 = 7 \cdot 1 = 7.\]

Thus, the value of \(a_1\) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",504,"[504, '504']",False
"To determine the number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls from a group of 7 boys and 4 girls, we need to use combinations. The order in which the students are selected does not matter, so we use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( r \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection.

The combination formula is given by:
\[ \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 boys. This is denoted as \( \binom{7}{3} \):
\[ \binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35 \]

To find the total number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls:

First, we simplify the denominator. The denominator is a difference of squares:

\[
(2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1

So the expression simplifies to:

(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-\sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{2} \cdot 2 + \sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}
\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[
2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6}
\]

We need to express this in the form \(A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})\). We can see that \(A = 2\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 3\), and \(D = 6\). Therefore, we have:

\[
2(1+\sqrt{2})-(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{6})
\]

Finally, we calculate \(A + B + C + D\):

\[
A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13
\]

"To find the value of the expression \((26^2 - 24^2 - 10)^2 - 10^2\), we will break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses. We start with the expression \(26^2 - 24^2\). Using the difference of squares formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\), we get:
\[
26^2 - 24^2 = (26 - 24)(26 + 24) = 2 \cdot 50 = 100.
\]
So the expression inside the parentheses becomes:
\[
26^2 - 24^2 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90.
\]
Now the original expression simplifies to:
\[
90^2 - 10^2.
\]
Next, we calculate \(90^2\) and \(10^2\):
\[
90^2 = 8100 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^2 = 100.
\]
So the expression further simplifies to:
\[
8100 - 100 = 8000.

"To find the integer \( C \) and \( D \) such that the equation

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}
\]

holds for all real \( x \) except \( x = -8 \) and \( x = 3 \), we start by factoring the denominator on the right-hand side. The quadratic \( x^2 + 5x - 24 \) can be factored as \( (x-3)(x+8) \). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.
\]

To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is \( (x-3)(x+8) \). This gives us

\[
\frac{C(x+8) + D(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:

\[
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23.
\]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get

\[
Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23.
\]

Combining like terms, we have

\[
(C+D)x + (8C-3D) = 4x - 23.
\]

For the equation to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:

\[
C + D = 4,
\]
\[
8C - 3D = -23.
\]

We can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 3:

\[
3C + 3D = 12.
\]

Next, we add this equation to the second equation:

\[
(3C + 3D) + (8C - 3D) = 12 + (-23),
\]
\[
11C = -11,
\]
\[
C = -1.
\]

Now that we have \( C = -1 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation:

\[
-1 + D = 4,
\]
\[
D = 5.
\]

Thus, the values of \( C \) and \( D \) are \( C = -1 \) and \( D = 5 \). The product \( CD \) is

\[
CD = (-1)(5) = -5.
\]

Therefore, the answer is

"To solve the equation \(2^{2x} = 256^{\frac{1}{2}}\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Let's start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation.

First, we know that \(256\) can be written as a power of 2. Specifically, \(256 = 2^8\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right-hand side as follows:
\[
256^{\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the right-hand side:
\[
(2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^4
\]
Now our equation looks like this:
\[
2^{2x} = 2^4
\]
Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[
2x = 4
\]
To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[

1. Start with the given equation:

   \]

2. Square both sides to remove the square root:
   \[
   (\sqrt{3x-5})^2=2^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x-5=4
   \]

3. Next, isolate the term with \(x\) by adding 5 to both sides:
   \[
   3x-5+5=4+5
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3x=9

4. Finally, solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   x=\frac{9}{3}

   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x=3

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(x=3\) back into the original equation and check if it holds true:
\[
\sqrt{3(3)-5}=\sqrt{9-5}=\sqrt{4}=2

"To find the number of integer pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(|a + bi| \le 5\), we start by recalling the definition of the magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \(a + bi\). The magnitude is given by:

\[
|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

We need to find all integer pairs \((a, b)\) such that:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \le 5
\]

Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get:

\[
a^2 + b^2 \le 25
\]

This inequality describes a disk centered at the origin with a radius of 5 in the coordinate plane. We need to count all integer points \((a, b)\) that lie within or on the boundary of this disk.

We will consider all possible integer values for \(a\) from \(-5\) to \(5\) and for each value of \(a\), determine the corresponding integer values of \(b\) that satisfy the inequality \(a^2 + b^2 \le 25\).

1. If \(a = 5\) or \(a = -5\), then \(b^2 \le 0\), so \(b = 0\). This gives us the points \((5, 0)\) and \((-5, 0)\).
2. If \(a = 4\) or \(a = -4\), then \(b^2 \le 9\), so \(b\) can be \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us the points \((4, -3)\), \((4, -2)\), \((4, -1)\), \((4, 0)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), \((4, 3)\), \((-4, -3)\), \((-4, -2)\), \((-4, -1)\), \((-4, 0)\), \((-4, 1)\), \((-4, 2)\), \((-4, 3)\).

5. If \(a = 1\) or \(a = -1\), then \(b^2 \le 24\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us the points \((1, -4)\), \((1, -3)\), \((1, -2)\), \((1, -1)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((1, 4)\), \((-1, -4)\), \((-1, -3)\), \((-1, -2)\), \((-1, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((-1, 1)\), \((-1, 2)\), \((-1, 3)\), \((-1, 4)\).
6. If \(a = 0\), then \(b^2 \le 25\), so \(b\) can be \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\). This gives us the points \((0, -5)\), \((0, -4)\), \((0, -3)\), \((0, -2)\), \((0, -1)\), \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, 2)\), \((0, 3)\), \((0, 4)\), \((0, 5)\).

Now, we count the number of points in each case:
- There are 2 points for \(a = 5\) or \(a = -5\).
- There are \(2 \times 7 = 14\) points for \(a = 4\) or \(a = -4\).
- There are \(2 \times 9 = 18\) points for \(a = 3\) or \(a = -3\).
- There are \(2 \times 9 = 18\) points for \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\).
- There are \(2 \times 9 = 18\) points for \(a = 1\) or \(a = -1\).
- There are \(2 \times 11 = 22\) points for \(a = 0\).

Adding these together, we get:

\[
2 + 14 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 22 = 90

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses, we need to consider different ways to group the terms to minimize the overall sum. Let's analyze the expression step by step.

The original expression is:
\[1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\]

First, let's calculate the sum without any parentheses:
\[1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\]

Now, let's try different groupings to see if we can get a smaller value.

1. Grouping the terms as \((1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6\):
\[(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3\]

2. Grouping the terms as \(1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + (5 + 6)\):
\[1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + (5 + 6) = 1 + 1 + 11 = 13\]

3. Grouping the terms as \(1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6\):
\[1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13\]

4. Grouping the terms as \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\):
\[1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 1 + 2 + 3 - 15 = -9\]

From the above groupings, the minimum value we have obtained is \(-9\). Let's verify that this is indeed the minimum by considering other possible groupings. Any other grouping will either keep the value at 13 or increase it.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses is:

"To determine whether the function \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is odd, even, or neither, we need to analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \( x \to -x \). Specifically, we need to evaluate \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \) and compare it to \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).

Given that \( f(x) \) is an odd function and \( g(x) \) is an even function, we know the following properties:
- For an odd function, \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).
- For an even function, \( g(-x) = g(x) \).

Let's start by evaluating \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \):
1. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). Therefore, \( f(g(f(g(f(-x)))) = f(g(f(g(-f(x)))) \).
2. Since \( g \) is even, \( g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)) \). Therefore, \( f(g(f(g(f(-x)))) = f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \).
3. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(g(f(g(f(x)))) = -f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \).
4. Since \( g \) is even, \( g(f(g(f(x))))) = g(f(g(f(x))))) \). Therefore, \( f(g(f(g(f(-x)))) = -f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \).
5. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(g(f(g(f(x)))) = -f(g(f(g(f(x)))) \). Therefore, \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) = f(-f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).
6. Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(-f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) = -f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).

"To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5\), we need to combine the fractions on the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x}{3}\).

The denominators are 2 and 3, and their least common multiple is 6. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6.

First, we rewrite \(\frac{x}{2}\) as \(\frac{x \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{3x}{6}\).

Next, we rewrite \(\frac{x}{3}\) as \(\frac{x \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{2x}{6}\).

Now, we can add the fractions together:
\[
\frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{3x + 2x}{6} = \frac{5x}{6}.
\]

So, the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5\) becomes \(\frac{5x}{6} = 5\).

To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate \(x\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{5}{6}\), which is \(\frac{6}{5}\):
\[
x = 5 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = 6.

Therefore, the solution is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of inverse proportionality. If the sales price of a television is inversely proportional to the number of customers who purchase it, then the product of the sales price and the number of customers is a constant.

Given:
- The sales price of the first television is \$1500.
- The number of customers who purchased this television is 15.

First, we calculate the constant of proportionality:
\[
\text{Constant} = \text{Sales Price} \times \text{Number of Customers} = 1500 \times 15 = 22500
\]

Now, we need to find the number of customers who purchased the second television, which has a sales price of \$2500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers who purchased the second television. According to the inverse proportionality, the product of the sales price and the number of customers must still equal the constant:
\[
2500 \times x = 22500
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
x = \frac{22500}{2500} = 9

Therefore, the number of customers who purchased the \$2500 television is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the area of quadrilateral \(DBEF\), we start by determining the coordinates of points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).

1. **Find the coordinates of \(D\):**
   Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), and \(A = (0, 6)\) and \(B = (0, 0)\), the coordinates of \(D\) are:
   \[
   D = \left( \frac{0+0}{2}, \frac{6+0}{2} \right) = (0, 3)
   \]

2. **Find the coordinates of \(E\):**
   Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\), and \(B = (0, 0)\) and \(C = (8, 0)\), the coordinates of \(E\) are:
   \[
   E = \left( \frac{0+8}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2} \right) = (4, 0)
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of \(F\):**
   Since \(F\) is the intersection of \(\overline{AE}\) and \(\overline{CD}\), we first find the equations of these lines.
   - The slope of \(\overline{AE}\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } AE = \frac{6-0}{0-4} = -\frac{3}{2}
     \]
     The equation of \(\overline{AE}\) in point-slope form is:
     \[
     y - 0 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 4) \implies y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6
     \]
   - The slope of \(\overline{CD}\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } CD = \frac{3-0}{0-8} = -\frac{3}{8}
     \]
     The equation of \(\overline{CD}\) in point-slope form is:
     \[
     y - 0 = -\frac{3}{8}(x - 8) \implies y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
     \]
   To find the intersection \(F\), we set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   6 - 3 = -\frac{3}{8}x + \frac{3}{2}x \implies 3 = \frac{9}{8}x \implies x = \frac{3 \cdot 8}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   Substituting \(x = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6\):
   \[
   y = -\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) + 6 = -4 + 6 = 2

   Therefore, the coordinates of \(F\) are:

   The area of a quadrilateral with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4)\) can be found using the Shoelace Theorem:

   Substituting the coordinates of \(D\), \(B\), \(E\), and \(F\):

"To solve the equation \( |x+5| - |3x-6| = 0 \), we need to consider the different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. These critical points are \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 2 \). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \). We will analyze the equation in each of these intervals.

**Case 1: \( x < -5 \)**

In this interval, both \( x+5 < 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the absolute values can be written as:
\[ |x+5| = -(x+5) = -x-5 \]
\[ |3x-6| = -(3x-6) = -3x+6 \]
The equation becomes:
\[ -x-5 - (-3x+6) = 0 \]
\[ -x-5 + 3x-6 = 0 \]
\[ 2x-11 = 0 \]
\[ 2x = 11 \]
\[ x = \frac{11}{2} \]
However, \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) is not in the interval \( (-\infty, -5) \). Therefore, there is no solution in this interval.

**Case 2: \( -5 \le x < 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the absolute values can be written as:
\[ |x+5| = x+5 \]
\[ |3x-6| = -(3x-6) = -3x+6 \]
The equation becomes:
\[ x+5 - (-3x+6) = 0 \]
\[ x+5 + 3x-6 = 0 \]
\[ 4x-1 = 0 \]
\[ 4x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{4} \]
Since \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) is in the interval \( [-5, 2) \), it is a valid solution.

**Case 3: \( x \ge 2 \)**

In this interval, both \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 \ge 0 \). Therefore, the absolute values can be written as:
\[ |x+5| = x+5 \]
\[ |3x-6| = 3x-6 \]
The equation becomes:
\[ x+5 - (3x-6) = 0 \]
\[ x+5 - 3x+6 = 0 \]
\[ -2x+11 = 0 \]
\[ -2x = -11 \]
\[ x = \frac{11}{2} \]
Since \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) is in the interval \( [2, \infty) \), it is a valid solution.

The solutions to the equation are \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = \frac{11}{2} \). The maximum of these solutions is \( \frac{11}{2} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( x \) is \(\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}\).","[11/2, '\\frac{11}{2}']",\frac{11}{2},"[11/2, '\\frac{11}{2}']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\lceil (3.6)^2 \rceil - ( \lceil 3.6 \rceil ) ^2\), we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we calculate \((3.6)^2\):
\[

\]
Next, we apply the ceiling function to 12.96. The ceiling function, denoted by \(\lceil x \rceil\), is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\). Therefore,
\[
\lceil 12.96 \rceil = 13

So, the first part of the expression \(\lceil (3.6)^2 \rceil\) is 13.

Now, we calculate \(\lceil 3.6 \rceil\). Applying the ceiling function to 3.6, we get
\[

Next, we square this value:

Now, we can substitute these values back into the original expression:

First, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns.

1. **Compute \( z_1 \):**
   \[
   z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + i + i}{\frac{1}{137} + i - i} = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 274i
   \]

2. **Compute \( z_2 \):**
   \[
   z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{1 + 274i + i}{1 + 274i - i} = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i}
   \]
   To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
   \[
   z_2 = \frac{(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 275 \cdot 273i^2}{1 - 273^2i^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 275 \cdot 273}{1 + 273^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 74625}{1 + 74529} = \frac{74626 + 2i}{74530} = \frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265}

3. **Compute \( z_3 \):**
   \[
   z_3 = F(z_2) = \frac{\frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265} + i}{\frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265} - i} = \frac{\frac{37313 + 37266i}{37265}}{\frac{37313 - 37264i}{37265}} = \frac{37313 + 37266i}{37313 - 37264i}
   \]
   Again, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
   \[
   z_3 = \frac{(37313 + 37266i)(37313 - 37264i)}{(37313 - 37264i)(37313 - 37264i)} = \frac{37313^2 - 37313 \cdot 37264i + 37266i \cdot 37313 - 37266i \cdot 37264i^2}{37313^2 - 2 \cdot 37313 \cdot 37264i + 37264^2i^2} = \frac{37313^2 + 37266^2}{37313^2 + 37264^2} + \frac{(37313^2 - 37266^2) - 2 \cdot 37313 \cdot 37264i}{37313^2 + 37264^2}i
   \]
   Notice that the real part of \( z_3 \) is 1 and the imaginary part is 0. Therefore, \( z_3 = 1 \).

4. **Compute \( z_4 \):**
   \[
   z_4 = F(z_3) = F(1) = \frac{1 + i}{1 - i}
   \]
   To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
   \[
   z_4 = \frac{(1 + i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{1 + 2i + i^2}{1 - i^2} = \frac{1 + 2i - 1}{1 + 1} = \frac{2i}{2} = i
   \]

5. **Compute \( z_5 \):**
   \[
   z_5 = F(z_4) = F(i) = \frac{i + i}{i - i} = \frac{2i}{0}

   This is undefined, but we can see that the sequence will repeat every 4 terms starting from \( z_3 \).

Since the sequence is periodic with a period of 4 starting from \( z_3 \), we can find \( z_{2002} \) by determining the position of 2002 in the cycle. The position is given by the remainder when 2002 is divided by 4:

1. Divide 555 by 5.
   \[
   555 \div 5 = 111 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0

   So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 0.

2. Divide 111 by 5.
   \[
   111 \div 5 = 22 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 1

"To determine the minimum number of miles the son must walk in 2 months to ensure that his mother can walk at least one mile per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in 2 months.
2. Determine the total number of miles the son must walk in those 2 months.
3. Ensure that the son's total walking distance is at least equal to the number of days in 2 months, since his mother needs to walk at least one mile per day.

First, let's assume that each month has approximately 30 days. Therefore, the total number of days in 2 months is:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 60 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that the son walks 4 miles every 3 days. To find out how many miles he walks per day, we divide the distance by the number of days:

Now, to find out how many miles the son must walk in 60 days, we multiply the number of days by the number of miles he walks per day:
\[ \text{Total miles} = 60 \text{ days} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ miles/day} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \text{ miles} \]

"To find the area of triangle \(ACD\), we first need to determine the height from vertex \(C\) to side \(AB\). Let's denote this height by \(h\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) can be calculated using Heron's formula. First, we find the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{17 + 8 + 15}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{20(20-17)(20-8)(20-15)} = \sqrt{20 \cdot 3 \cdot 12 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{3600} = 60
\]

The area of triangle \(ABC\) can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times h

Setting the two expressions for the area equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times h = 60 \implies 17h = 120 \implies h = \frac{120}{17}
\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(AD\). Since \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(C\) to \(AB\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \(ACD\) and \(BCD\).

First, consider triangle \(ACD\):
\[
AC^2 = AD^2 + h^2 \implies 8^2 = AD^2 + \left(\frac{120}{17}\right)^2 \implies 64 = AD^2 + \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = 64 - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{18496}{289} - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{4096}{289} \implies AD = \frac{64}{17}

This can be done by first finding the remainder when 11213141 is divided by 18 and then using the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, we perform the division of 11213141 by 18:
\[ 11213141 \div 18 = 622952.2777\ldots \]
The integer part of the quotient is 622952. Now, we multiply this integer by 18 to find the product:

Next, we subtract this product from 11213141 to find the remainder:

This means:

Let's start with step 1. Substitute \( x = -3 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(-3) = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 2
\]

We know that \( f(-3) = 2 \), so we can set up the equation:

\[
81a - 9b + 2 = 2
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
81a - 9b = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 9 \) on the left side:

\[
9(9a - b) = 0
\]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[
9a - b = 0

This simplifies to:

\[
b = 9a

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9b + 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 8

Substitute \( b = 9a \) into the expression:

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9(9a) + 8 = 81a - 81a + 8 = 8

   A + 90^\circ + C + 90^\circ = 360^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   A + C + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
   \]
   Subtracting \( 180^\circ \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   A + C = 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the maximum angle:**
   Since \( A \) is the maximum angle and \( C \) is the other angle, and given that \( A = 2C \) (because the maximum angle is twice the minimum angle), we substitute \( A = 2C \) into the equation \( A + C = 180^\circ \):
   \[
   2C + C = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   3C = 180^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
   \[
   C = 60^\circ
   \]
   Since \( A = 2C \), we substitute \( C = 60^\circ \) into this equation:
   \[
   A = 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the maximum angle is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"To find the equation of the hyperbola and the value of \( h + k + a + b \), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the hyperbola.

The foci of the hyperbola are \( F_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( F_2 = (-16, 2) \). The distance between the foci is:
\[
2c = \sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{26^2} = 26.
\]
Thus, \( c = 13 \).

The condition given is \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \). For a hyperbola, this is equal to \( 2a \), so:
\[
2a = 24 \implies a = 12.
\]

The relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) for a hyperbola is given by:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
\]
Substituting the known values of \( a \) and \( c \):
\[
13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5.
\]

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment joining the foci. The coordinates of the center are:
\[
\left( \frac{10 + (-16)}{2}, \frac{2 + 2}{2} \right) = (-3, 2).
\]
Thus, \( h = -3 \) and \( k = 2 \).

The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis is:
\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.
\]
Substituting the values of \( h \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \):
\[
\frac{(x + 3)^2}{144} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{25} = 1.
\]

Now, we need to find \( h + k + a + b \):
\[
h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the first 42 positive integers. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Summing these values gives:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9

"To solve for the possible values of \( n \) given the conditions on the sums of the sequence \( (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) \), we start by analyzing the given equations:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216.
\]

First, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \),

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \right)^2.
\]

Applying this to the sequences \( (a_i) \) and \( (1) \), we get

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n 1^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \right)^2,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
n \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \right)^2.
\]

Substituting the given values, we have

\[
n \cdot 144 \geq 96^2,
\]

or

\[
144n \geq 9216,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
n \geq 64.
\]

Next, we use the Power Mean Inequality, which states that for any positive real numbers \( a_i \),

\[
\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n}.
\]

Applying this to the given values, we get

\[
\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{96}{n}.
\]

First, we consider the inequality

\[
\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \frac{96}{n}.
\]

Cubing both sides, we obtain

\[
\frac{216}{n} \geq \frac{96^3}{n^3},
\]

or

\[
216n^2 \geq 96^3,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
216n^2 \geq 884736,
\]

or

\[
n^2 \geq 4116,
\]

which further simplifies to

\[
n \geq \sqrt{4116} \approx 64.16.
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have

\[
n \geq 65.
\]

Next, we consider the inequality

\[
\left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{96}{n}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain

\[
\frac{144}{n} \geq \frac{96^2}{n^2},

\[

\]

which simplifies to

\[

or

\[

\]

This inequality is consistent with the previous result \( n \geq 65 \). Therefore, the only possible value for \( n \) is 65. We verify this by checking if the sequence \( a_i = 64 \) satisfies all the given conditions:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{65} a_i = 65 \cdot 64 = 4160 \neq 96,
\]

so \( n = 65 \) is not a valid solution. We need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the possibility of a different sequence. Let's assume \( a_1 = 64 \) and \( a_2 = 32 \) and \( a_3 = 0 \) and so on. This sequence satisfies all the given conditions:

"To find the quotient of \(413_5 \div 2_5\) in base 5, we first need to convert the base 5 numbers to base 10, perform the division in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 5.

### Step 1: Convert \(413_5\) to base 10
The base 5 number \(413_5\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0
\]
Calculating each term, we get:
\[
4 \cdot 25 = 100, \quad 1 \cdot 5 = 5, \quad 3 \cdot 1 = 3
\]
Adding these values together, we get:
\[
100 + 5 + 3 = 108
\]
So, \(413_5\) in base 10 is \(108\).

### Step 2: Convert \(2_5\) to base 10
The base 5 number \(2_5\) is already a base 10 number, which is \(2\).

### Step 3: Perform the division in base 10
Now, we divide \(108\) by \(2\):
\[
108 \div 2 = 54
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(54\) back to base 5
To convert \(54\) from base 10 to base 5, we repeatedly divide by 5 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
54 \div 5 = 10 \text{ remainder } 4
\]
\[
10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ remainder } 0
\]
\[
2 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 2

"To determine the probability that after the two-step process, the two bags contain the same color ball, we need to consider all possible outcomes of the process and count the favorable ones.

First, let's define the bags:
- Bob's bag: \( B = \{ \text{blue} \} \)
- Alice's bag: \( A = \{ \text{red}, \text{green}, \text{orange}, \text{yellow}, \text{purple} \} \)

The process consists of two steps:
1. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and places it in Bob's bag.
2. Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag and places it in Alice's bag.

We need to find the probability that after these two steps, the color of the ball in Bob's bag is the same as the color of the ball in Alice's bag.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Alice's Selection
Alice has 5 possible balls to choose from:
- Blue

#### Step 2: Bob's Selection
After Alice places her ball in Bob's bag, Bob's bag will contain:
- Blue

Now, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag. The possible outcomes are:
- Blue

### Step 3: Determine Favorable Outcomes
For the two bags to contain the same color ball after the process, Bob must select the blue ball from his bag. There is only one favorable outcome:
- Bob selects the blue ball.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes
- Alice has 5 possible choices.
- Bob has 1 possible choice (the blue ball).

Thus, the total number of outcomes is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Probability
The probability that the two bags contain the same color ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Therefore, the probability that after the two-step process, the two bags contain the same color ball is:

First, let's use the trigonometric substitutions:
\[ x = \sin \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = \sin \phi \]
where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\). This substitution ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are within the range \([-1, 1]\).

The function \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) achieves its maximum value of 1 when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). Since \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are in the range \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\), the maximum value of \(\theta + \phi\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

\[
2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 2n + 14 - 2n - 1 = 13
\]

Since \(d\) divides 13, and 13 is a prime number, the possible values for \(d\) are 1 and 13. To determine if \(d\) can actually be 13, we need to check if there exists an integer \(n\) such that both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\) are divisible by 13. If we set \(n = 13k - 7\) for some integer \(k\), then:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 11 members (5 Democrat, 5 Republican, and 1 Independent) in a circle such that each member sits next to members from the other two parties, we need to consider the constraints and use combinatorial methods.

First, let's denote the members as follows:
- \(D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_5\) for the Democrat members
- \(R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5\) for the Republican members
- \(I\) for the Independent member

Since each member must sit next to members from the other two parties, the Independent member \(I\) must be placed in a position such that it is not adjacent to any other member. This means that the Independent member must be placed in a "" gap"" between the Democrat and Republican members.

We can start by arranging the 10 members (5 Democrats and 5 Republicans) in a circle. The number of ways to arrange \(n\) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 10 members in a circle is:
\[
(10-1)! = 9!
\]

Next, we need to place the Independent member \(I\) in a gap between the Democrat and Republican members. There are 10 gaps between the 10 members (since the arrangement is circular). However, since the Independent member must be placed in a gap that is not adjacent to any other member, there are only 5 possible gaps to choose from.

Thus, the number of ways to place the Independent member \(I\) is:

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{z} = \overline{z} \), the complex conjugate of \( z \). The given equation can be rewritten as:

\[ z + \overline{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This implies that the real part of \( z \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \overline{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \) (since \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \)). However, the value of \( \cos(85\theta) \) will be the same for both \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) and \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \) due to the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function.

For \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \),

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi, \]

and

\[ \cos(34\pi) = \cos(0) = 1. \]

For \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \),

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{5} = 68\pi, \]

and

\[ \cos(68\pi) = \cos(0) = 1. \]

Therefore,

\[ \cos(85\theta) = 1, \]

and

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{27}}\), we need to simplify the square root in the denominator. Let's start by finding the square root of 27.

We know that:
\[27 = 9 \times 3\]
and since \(9\) is a perfect square, we can simplify \(\sqrt{27}\) as follows:
\[\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \times 3} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}\]

Now, substitute this back into the original expression:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given that \(xyz = 2\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

First, we rewrite the expression as:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]

We will apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), and \(2y^2\), and \(z^4\). The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \(a, b, c, d\),
\[\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{abcd},\]
with equality if and only if \(a = b = c = d\).

Applying the AM-GM inequality to \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), \(2y^2\), and \(z^4\), we get:
\[\frac{x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + z^4}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{x^4 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot 2y^2 \cdot z^4} = \sqrt[4]{4x^4y^4z^4} = \sqrt[4]{4(xyz)^4} = \sqrt[4]{4 \cdot 2^4} = \sqrt[4]{64} = 2\sqrt{2}.\]

Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 8\sqrt{2}.\]

Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds if and only if \(x^4 = 2y^2 = z^4\). Let \(x^4 = k\), \(2y^2 = k\), and \(z^4 = k\). Then \(y^2 = \frac{k}{2}\) and \(z^4 = k\). From \(xyz = 2\), we have:
\[x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}} \cdot k^{1/4} = 2.\]

Since \(x^4 = k\), we have \(x = k^{1/4}\). Substituting \(x = k^{1/4}\) into the equation, we get:
\[k^{1/4} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}} \cdot k^{1/4} = 2,\]
\[k^{1/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}} = 2,\]
\[k^{3/2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2,\]
\[k^{3/2} = 2\sqrt{2},\]
\[k^{3/2} = 2^{3/2},\]
\[k = 2.\]

Thus, \(x^4 = 2\), \(y^2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1\), and \(z^4 = 2\). Therefore, \(x = 2^{1/4}\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 2^{1/4}\). Substituting these values back into the original expression, we get:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2 + 4 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.\]

"To solve the equation \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{x-5}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the denominators** by cross-multiplying. This means we multiply the numerator of the left fraction by the denominator of the right fraction and set it equal to the product of the numerator of the right fraction and the denominator of the left fraction.
   \[
   2 \cdot (x-5) = 4 \cdot 3

2. **Simplify both sides** of the equation. On the left side, distribute the 2; on the right side, multiply 4 by 3.
   \[
   2x - 10 = 12
   \]

3. **Isolate the term with \(x\)** by adding 10 to both sides of the equation.

"To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( x \) that satisfies the following conditions:
1. When \( x \) is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1.
2. When \( x \) is divided by 7, the remainder is 0.
3. \( x \) is greater than 75.

First, let's express the first condition mathematically. If \( x \) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, then \( x - 1 \) must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. Therefore, \( x - 1 \) must be a multiple of 12. We can write this as:
\[ x - 1 = 12k \]
for some integer \( k \). This implies:
\[ x = 12k + 1 \]

Next, we use the second condition, which states that \( x \) is divisible by 7. Substituting \( x = 12k + 1 \) into this condition, we get:
\[ 12k + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 12k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ 5k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
To solve for \( k \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is a number \( y \) such that:
\[ 5y \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
We can test the values of \( y \) from 1 to 6:
\[ 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
So, the inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3. Multiplying both sides of the congruence \( 5k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) by 3, we get:
\[ k \equiv 18 \pmod{7} \]
\[ k \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
This means that \( k \) can be written as:
\[ k = 7m + 4 \]
for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 7m + 4 \) back into the expression for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 12(7m + 4) + 1 \]
\[ x = 84m + 49 \]
So, \( x \) must be of the form \( 84m + 49 \). Finally, we use the third condition, which states that \( x \) is greater than 75. Therefore, we need:
\[ 84m + 49 > 75 \]
\[ 84m > 26 \]
\[ m > \frac{26}{84} \]
\[ m > \frac{13}{42} \]
Since \( m \) is an integer, the smallest possible value for \( m \) is 1. Substituting \( m = 1 \) into the expression for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 84 \cdot 1 + 49 \]
\[ x = 133 \]

"To find \( f(2015, 2) \), we need to understand the recursive definition of the function \( f \):

f(i-1, f(i, j-1)) & \text{ if } i \ge 1 \text{ and } 1 \le j \le 4. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's compute the base case for \( i = 0 \):
\[ f(0, j) = \text{mod}_5 (j+1). \]
This means:
\[ f(0, 0) = \text{mod}_5 (0+1) = 1, \]
\[ f(0, 1) = \text{mod}_5 (1+1) = 2, \]
\[ f(0, 2) = \text{mod}_5 (2+1) = 3, \]
\[ f(0, 3) = \text{mod}_5 (3+1) = 4, \]
\[ f(0, 4) = \text{mod}_5 (4+1) = 0. \]

Now, let's use the recursive definition to find \( f(1, j) \):
\[ f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2, \]
\[ f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 3, \]
\[ f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0, 4) = 0, \]
\[ f(1, 4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0, 0) = 1. \]

Next, let's find \( f(2, j) \):
\[ f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3, \]
\[ f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) = f(1, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(2, 2) = f(1, f(2, 1)) = f(1, 4) = 0, \]
\[ f(2, 3) = f(1, f(2, 2)) = f(1, 0) = 2, \]
\[ f(2, 4) = f(1, f(2, 3)) = f(1, 2) = 3. \]

We observe a pattern. Let's generalize this pattern. For \( i = 2 \), the function \( f(2, j) \) cycles through the values 3, 4, 0, 2, 3. This pattern will repeat every 4 values of \( j \).

To find \( f(2015, 2) \), we need to determine the position of 2015 in the cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 2015 is divided by 4:
\[ 2015 \div 4 = 503 \text{ remainder } 3. \]
So, \( 2015 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

This means that \( f(2015, 2) \) is the same as \( f(2, 2) \), which is 0.

"To find the value of \(\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2\), we start by defining the determinant of the matrix as follows:

The determinant \(D\) can be expressed in terms of the squared distances between the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\). The squared distance between two points \((x_i, y_i)\) and \((x_j, y_j)\) is given by:
\[
(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2.
\]

\[
(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2 = 16,

\[

These distances correspond to the sides of a triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5. The area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be found using Heron's formula. First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6.
\]
Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(A\):
\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6.

The area of a triangle can also be expressed as:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|.
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
6 = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|.
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:
\[
12 = \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|.
\]
The expression inside the absolute value is exactly the determinant \(D\) times 2:
\[
\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right| = 2 \left| D \right|.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
12 = 2 \left| D \right| \implies \left| D \right| = 6.

The square of the determinant is:
\[
D^2 = \left( \left| D \right| \right)^2 = 6^2 = 36.

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the median. In this case, the ratio is \(AG:AD = 2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

3v^2t^2 + d^2 = \sqrt{(v^2t^2 + d^2)(9v^2t^2 + d^2)} \cos \angle APB

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(3v^2t^2 + d^2)^2 = (v^2t^2 + d^2)(9v^2t^2 + d^2) \cos^2 \angle APB
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
9v^4t^4 + 6v^2t^2d^2 + d^4 = (9v^4t^4 + 10v^2t^2d^2 + d^4) \cos^2 \angle APB
\]
Dividing both sides by \(9v^4t^4 + 10v^2t^2d^2 + d^4\), we get:
\[
\cos^2 \angle APB = \frac{9v^4t^4 + 6v^2t^2d^2 + d^4}{9v^4t^4 + 10v^2t^2d^2 + d^4}
\]
To maximize \(\angle APB\), we need to minimize \(\cos^2 \angle APB\). The minimum value of \(\cos^2 \angle APB\) occurs when the numerator is minimized relative to the denominator. This happens when \(t = 0\), but since \(t\) is the time and cannot be zero, we consider the behavior as \(t\) approaches zero. As \(t\) approaches zero, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\cos^2 \angle APB = \frac{d^4}{d^4} = 1
\]
However, this is not the correct approach to find the maximum angle. Instead, we use the fact that the maximum angle occurs when the derivative of \(\cos^2 \angle APB\) with respect to \(t\) is zero. This is a more complex calculation, but it can be shown that the maximum angle occurs when the runners are at a specific relative position.

Using geometric properties and symmetry, it can be shown that the maximum angle \(\angle APB\) is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(\angle APB\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24\) and find the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\), we will first rewrite the equation in standard polynomial form.

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24.
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by \(x\):
   \[
   x \left( \frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 \right) = x (6x - 24).
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x.
   \]

3. Rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:
   \[
   5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0.

Now, the equation is a cubic polynomial in the standard form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), where \(a = 5\), \(b = -6\), \(c = 24\), and \(d = 1\).

"To find the sum of the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200, we first need to identify the smallest and largest multiples of 7 within this range.

1. **Find the smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100:**
   \[
   \frac{100}{7} \approx 14.2857
   \]
   Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 15.
   \[
   15 \times 7 = 105
   \]
   So, the smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100 is 105.

2. **Find the largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200:**
   \[
   \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.5714
   \]
   Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we get 28.
   \[
   28 \times 7 = 196
   \]
   So, the largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200 is 196.

3. **List the multiples of 7 from 105 to 196:**
   The multiples of 7 form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 105, the common difference \(d\) is 7, and the last term \(a_n\) is 196. The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   196 = 105 + (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   196 - 105 = (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   \[
   91 = (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   \[
   n-1 = \frac{91}{7}

   \[
   n-1 = 13

"To express the quadratic \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\) in the form \((x + b)^2 + c\), we need to complete the square. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the quadratic expression: \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\).
2. Identify the coefficient of \(x\), which is 2.6. To complete the square, we take half of this coefficient, square it, and add and subtract this value inside the expression. Half of 2.6 is 1.3, and squaring it gives \(1.3^2 = 1.69\).
3. Rewrite the expression as: \(x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 - 1.69 + 3.6\).
4. Group the perfect square trinomial and the constants: \((x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + (3.6 - 1.69)\).
5. The expression \(x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69\) is a perfect square trinomial and can be written as \((x + 1.3)^2\). So, the expression becomes: \((x + 1.3)^2 + (3.6 - 1.69)\).
6. Simplify the constant term: \(3.6 - 1.69 = 1.91\).

Thus, the quadratic expression \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\) can be written as \((x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91\). Here, \(b = 1.3\) and \(c = 1.91\).

To find \(b + c\), we add these values together: \(1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21\).

"To find the two consecutive even numbers whose product is 288, we can let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( x+2 \). According to the problem, their product is 288, so we can write the equation:

\[ x(x+2) = 288 \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ x^2 + 2x = 288 \]

To form a standard quadratic equation, we need to move 288 to the left side:

\[ x^2 + 2x - 288 = 0 \]

Next, we need to factor this quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-288\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(18\) and \(-16\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[ (x + 18)(x - 16) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for \( x \):

\[ x + 18 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 16 = 0 \]
\[ x = -18 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 16 \]

Since we are looking for positive even numbers, we discard \( x = -18 \) and take \( x = 16 \). The next consecutive even number is \( x + 2 = 18 \). Therefore, the two consecutive even numbers are \( 16 \) and \( 18 \).

1. **Count the total number of integers in the set:**
   The set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) contains 100 integers.

2. **Count the number of integers divisible by 2:**
   An integer \(n\) is divisible by 2 if \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). The largest integer \(k\) such that \(2k \leq 100\) is 50. Therefore, there are 50 integers in the set that are divisible by 2.

3. **Count the number of integers divisible by 6:**
   An integer \(n\) is divisible by 6 if \(n = 6k\) for some integer \(k\). The largest integer \(k\) such that \(6k \leq 100\) is 16. Therefore, there are 16 integers in the set that are divisible by 6.

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\), we start by simplifying it. Let \(x = a + \frac{1}{b}\) and \(y = \frac{1}{b} - a\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
xy = \left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2 = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2
\]

We need to maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) given the constraints \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\).

First, consider the term \(\frac{1}{b^2}\). Since \(b\) ranges from 3 to 5, the minimum value of \(b^2\) is \(3^2 = 9\) and the maximum value of \(b^2\) is \(5^2 = 25\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is \(\frac{1}{25}\) and the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is \(\frac{1}{9}\).

Next, consider the term \(-a^2\). Since \(a\) ranges from \(-6\) to \(-2\), the maximum value of \(a^2\) is \(6^2 = 36\) and the minimum value of \(a^2\) is \(2^2 = 4\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(-a^2\) is \(-4\) and the maximum value of \(-a^2\) is \(-36\).

To find the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\), we need to choose the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) and the minimum value of \(-a^2\). This gives us:

\[
\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ
\]

We can factor out \(\sin 100^\circ\) from the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \sin 100^\circ \left( \frac{1}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \right)
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\sin 100^\circ\) and \(\cos 100^\circ\). Since \(100^\circ\) is in the second quadrant, \(\sin 100^\circ\) is positive and \(\cos 100^\circ\) is negative. We know that:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 100^\circ = -\cos (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = -\cos 80^\circ
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ \left( \frac{1}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( \frac{1}{-\cos 80^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( -\frac{1}{\cos 80^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( \frac{-1 + 4 \cos 80^\circ}{\cos 80^\circ} \right) = \frac{\sin 80^\circ (-1 + 4 \cos 80^\circ)}{\cos 80^\circ}

So, each interior angle of the heptagon is \( \frac{900^\circ}{7} \).

Next, let's consider the square. The interior angle of a square is \( 90^\circ \).

Now, let's place the heptagon and the square such that they share the common edge \( \overline{AD} \). The vertex \( A \) is a common vertex for both the heptagon and the square.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the total number of 3x3 squares in a \( 3 \times n \) grid is 70. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, consider a \( 3 \times n \) grid. A 3x3 square can be formed by choosing any 3 consecutive rows and any 3 consecutive columns. The number of ways to choose 3 consecutive rows from \( n \) rows is \( n-2 \) (since the first row of the square can be in any row from 1 to \( n-2 \)). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive columns from \( n \) columns is also \( n-2 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3x3 squares in a \( 3 \times n \) grid is:
\[
(n-2) \times (n-2) = (n-2)^2
\]
We are given that this total number is 70, so we can set up the equation:
\[
(n-2)^2 = 70
\]
To solve for \( n \), we take the square root of both sides:
\[
n-2 = \sqrt{70}
\]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, we need to check if \( \sqrt{70} \) is an integer. Calculating the square root of 70, we get:
\[
\sqrt{70} \approx 8.37
\]
Since 8.37 is not an integer, there is no integer \( n \) that satisfies the equation \( (n-2)^2 = 70 \).

Therefore, the problem as stated has no solution. However, if we assume there was a typo and the correct number of squares is 64 (since \( 8^2 = 64 \)), then we would have:

"To find the area of a triangle with sides of lengths 5, 5, and 6 units, we can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}

For our triangle, the sides are \(a = 5\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 6\). First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Next, we substitute \(s\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into Heron's formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{8(8-5)(8-5)(8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12

Therefore, the area of the triangle is \(\boxed{12}\) square units.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its base and height. Since the triangle is isosceles with two sides of length 5 and a base of length 6, we can drop a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the base, dividing the triangle into two right triangles. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of 5 and a base of 3 (half of the original base). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height \(h\):

\[

The area of the original triangle is then:

\[

Here, \( a_n = 1 \) and \( a_0 = 20 \), and \( n = 4 \), so the product of the roots is:
\[
(-1)^4 \frac{20}{1} = 20
\]

The roots \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \) correspond to the \( x \)-coordinates of the solutions to the system of equations. For each root \( x_i \), the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate is \( y_i = x_i^2 - 8 \). We need to find the product of the \( y \)-coordinates:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8)

To simplify this, we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \( x_1^2, x_2^2, x_3^2, x_4^2 \) can be obtained by substituting \( x = \sqrt{y + 8} \) into the original polynomial and eliminating the square root. However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the product of the roots of a polynomial and the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \) is zero (since the coefficient of \( x^3 \) is zero).

t^4 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)t^2 + (x_1^2 x_2^2 + x_1^2 x_3^2 + x_1^2 x_4^2 + x_2^2 x_3^2 + x_2^2 x_4^2 + x_3^2 x_4^2)t - (x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 + x_1^2 x_2^2 x_4^2 + x_1^2 x_3^2 x_4^2 + x_2^2 x_3^2 x_4^2) = 0
\]

The product of the roots of this polynomial is:
\[
(x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 x_4^2) = (x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4)^2 = 20^2 = 400
\]

Now, we need to find the product of the \( y \)-coordinates:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8)
\]

Using the identity for the product of the roots of a polynomial, we can expand this expression:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 x_4^2 - 8(x_1^2 x_2^2 + x_1^2 x_3^2 + x_1^2 x_4^2 + x_2^2 x_3^2 + x_2^2 x_4^2 + x_3^2 x_4^2) + 64(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2) - 512
\]

Since \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 0 \), we have \( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)^2 - 2(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4) = -2(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4) \). However, we do not need the exact value of \( x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4 \) to find the product of the \( y \)-coordinates, as it will cancel out in the expansion.

Thus, the product of the \( y \)-coordinates is:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = 400 - 512 = -112

"To determine how much of the pie (piy) was eaten by Ruil and Jack together, we need to add the fractions of the pie that each of them ate. Ruil ate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the pie, and Jack ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the pie. To add these fractions, we first need a common denominator.

The denominators are 5 and 3. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 15.

First, we convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{3}{15}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{10}{15}
\]

Now that we have a common denominator, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{3}{15} + \frac{10}{15} = \frac{3 + 10}{15} = \frac{13}{15}

Therefore, the total fraction of the pie that was eaten by Ruil and Jack together is \(\boxed{\frac{13}{15}}\).","[13/15, '\\frac{13}{15}']",\frac{13}{15},"[13/15, '\\frac{13}{15}']",True
"To find the 6th term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The 4th term \(a_4 = 200\),
2. The 8th term \(a_8 = 500\).

Using the general formula, we can write the following equations based on the given information:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the 4th term to find the first term \(a_1\):
\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the 6th term \(a_6\) using the general formula:
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]

"To find the smallest positive integer \(a\) such that the sum of the infinite geometric series \(4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots\) is a perfect square, we start by determining the sum of the series. The first term \(a_1\) of the series is 4, and the common ratio \(r\) is \(\frac{\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \frac{3}{a}\).

The sum \(S\) of an infinite geometric series with \(|r| < 1\) is given by:
\[
S = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}
\]
Substituting the values of \(a_1\) and \(r\), we get:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4}{\frac{a - 3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a - 3}
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect square. Let \(S = k^2\) for some integer \(k\). Then:
\[
\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
4a = k^2(a - 3) \implies 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \implies 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \implies a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \implies a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}
\]
Since \(a\) must be a positive integer, \(k^2 - 4\) must be a positive divisor of \(3k^2\). Therefore, \(k^2 > 4\) or \(k > 2\). We will test the smallest integer values of \(k\) greater than 2.

For \(k = 3\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 3^2}{3^2 - 4} = \frac{27}{9 - 4} = \frac{27}{5}

This is not an integer.

For \(k = 4\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{4^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{16 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4

This is an integer. We check if the sum of the series is a perfect square:
\[

"To determine how many \( y \)-cut slices the parabola \( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \) has, we need to analyze the given equation and understand the nature of the parabola.

The equation \( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \) is a quadratic equation in terms of \( y \). To better understand the shape of the parabola, we can rewrite it in vertex form by completing the square.

Starting with the equation:
\[ x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \]

First, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 - 4y \]

To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(-4\), divide it by 2 to get \(-2\), and then square it to get \(4\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x = (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 - 1 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = (y - 2)^2 - 5 \]

Now, the equation is in vertex form:
\[ x = (y - 2)^2 - 5 \]

From this form, we can see that the parabola opens to the right because the coefficient of \((y - 2)^2\) is positive. The vertex of the parabola is at \((-5, 2)\).

To find the \( y \)-intercepts, we set \( x = 0 \) and solve for \( y \):
\[ 0 = (y - 2)^2 - 5 \]
\[ (y - 2)^2 = 5 \]
\[ y - 2 = \pm \sqrt{5} \]
\[ y = 2 \pm \sqrt{5} \]

So, the \( y \)-intercepts are \( y = 2 + \sqrt{5} \) and \( y = 2 - \sqrt{5} \).

To find the \( x \)-intercepts, we set \( y = 0 \) and solve for \( x \):
\[ x = (0 - 2)^2 - 5 \]
\[ x = 4 - 5 \]
\[ x = -1 \]

So, the \( x \)-intercept is \( x = -1 \).

The parabola \( x = (y - 2)^2 - 5 \) is a continuous curve that extends infinitely in the \( y \)-direction. Therefore, there are infinitely many \( y \)-cut slices.

"To find the minimum value of \( \left| m - n \right| \) given the equation \( 3m + 4n = 100 \), we start by expressing \( m \) in terms of \( n \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4n}{3} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 100 - 4n \) must be divisible by 3. We can check the divisibility by finding the remainder when 100 and \( 4n \) are divided by 3:

\[ 100 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 4n \equiv n \pmod{3} \]

Thus, \( 100 - 4n \equiv 1 - n \pmod{3} \). For \( 100 - 4n \) to be divisible by 3, we need:

\[ 1 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]

This means \( n \) can be written as \( n = 3k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k + 1 \) into the expression for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4(3k + 1)}{3} = \frac{100 - 12k - 4}{3} = \frac{96 - 12k}{3} = 32 - 4k \]

Now, we need to minimize \( \left| m - n \right| \):

\[ \left| m - n \right| = \left| (32 - 4k) - (3k + 1) \right| = \left| 31 - 7k \right| \]

To find the minimum value of \( \left| 31 - 7k \right| \), we need to find the integer \( k \) that makes \( 31 - 7k \) as close to 0 as possible. We solve:

\[ 31 - 7k \approx 0 \]
\[ 7k \approx 31 \]
\[ k \approx \frac{31}{7} \approx 4.4286 \]

The closest integers to 4.4286 are 4 and 5. We check both values:

"To determine whether the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) can be expressed as a finite decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction has a finite decimal representation. A fraction in its simplest form \(\frac{a}{b}\) has a finite decimal representation if and only if the denominator \(b\) (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.

Let's analyze the given fraction:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}
\]
The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). The prime factors of the denominator are 2 and 5. Since the only prime factors of the denominator are 2 and 5, the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) can be expressed as a finite decimal.

"To determine the smallest angle in triangle \(PQS\), we first need to find the coordinates of the centers \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\) of the circles. Given that the circles are all of radius 1 and are mutually tangent, the distance between any two centers is 2. The centers \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\) form an equilateral triangle with side length 2.

The coordinates of the centers are:
- \(P = (1, \sqrt{3})\)
- \(Q = (-1, \sqrt{3})\)
- \(R = (0, 0)\)

Next, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(S\). Since \(S\) is also 2 units away from \(P\) and \(Q\), and lies on the line \(y = \sqrt{3}\), we can solve the system of equations:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - \sqrt{3})^2 = 4
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y - \sqrt{3})^2 = 4
\]

Expanding and simplifying these equations, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y\sqrt{3} + 3 = 4
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y\sqrt{3} + 3 = 4
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[
4x = 0 \implies x = 0
\]

Substituting \(x = 0\) back into the first equation, we get:
\[
1 + y^2 - 2y\sqrt{3} + 3 = 4 \implies y^2 - 2y\sqrt{3} = 0 \implies y(y - 2\sqrt{3}) = 0
\]

Thus, \(y = 0\) or \(y = 2\sqrt{3}\). Since \(S\) is not at the same height as \(P\) and \(Q\), we have \(S = (0, 2\sqrt{3})\).

Now, we have the coordinates of \(P\), \(Q\), and \(S\):
- \(P = (1, \sqrt{3})\)
- \(Q = (-1, \sqrt{3})\)
- \(S = (0, 2\sqrt{3})\)

We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of triangle \(PQS\):
\[
PQ = \sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]
\[
PS = \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = 2
\]
\[
QS = \sqrt{((-1) - 0)^2 + (\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = 2
\]

Since all three sides of triangle \(PQS\) are equal, triangle \(PQS\) is equilateral. Therefore, each angle in triangle \(PQS\) is:
\[
\frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ

Thus, the smallest angle in triangle \(PQS\) is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",False

We need to determine the coefficients \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). First, we can use the determinant method to find the coefficients. The equation of the plane can be written as the determinant of a matrix formed by the coordinates of the points:

Next, the second determinant:

\[

Next, the third determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & -1 & 1 \\

Finally, the fourth determinant:

\[

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we start by rationalizing the denominators of the fractions. This gives us:

\[
\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

\[
\sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Now, we combine these two results into a single expression:

\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6}
\]

\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3} \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[
\frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6} + \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}

In this form, the expression is \(\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\) where \(a = 9\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 6\). Since \(c\) is as small as possible, we have:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}\), we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers and some inequalities. Let's start by analyzing the expression and applying some known inequalities.

First, we use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \(x, y, z\),

\[
\frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}.
\]

Applying this to our expression, we get

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}}.
\]

Since \(\frac{b}{b+c} < 1\), it follows that \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}} < 1\). Therefore,

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} > 3.
\]

However, we need to find the exact minimum value. Let's test some specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if we can achieve a value close to 3.

Consider the case when \(a = b = c\). Substituting \(a = b = c\) into the expression, we get

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a+a} + \frac{a}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{5}{2}.
\]

So, the value \(\frac{5}{2}\) is achieved when \(a = b = c\). Now, we need to check if this is the minimum value. We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers or other inequalities to confirm that \(\frac{5}{2}\) is indeed the minimum.

Using the Nesbitt's inequality, which states that for positive real numbers \(x, y, z\),

\[
\frac{x}{y+z} + \frac{y}{z+x} + \frac{z}{x+y} \geq \frac{3}{2},
\]

we can rewrite our expression as

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} \geq \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} \geq \frac{5}{2}.

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) in the form \( k^n \) where \( k \) is a positive integer. This means that \( 2^{24} = k^n \).

Since the left side of the equation is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some non-negative integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get:
\[

\]
Using the property of exponents \((a^b)^c = a^{bc}\), we can rewrite the right side as:
\[
2^{24} = 2^{mn}
\]
For the equation \( 2^{24} = 2^{mn} \) to hold, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
24 = mn
\]
We need to find all pairs \((m, n)\) of positive integers such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). The possible values for \( m \) are the divisors of 24, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since \( n > 1 \), \( m \) cannot be 24. Therefore, the possible values for \( m \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.

For each value of \( m \), the corresponding value of \( n \) is:
- If \( m = 1 \), then \( n = 24 \)
- If \( m = 2 \), then \( n = 12 \)
- If \( m = 3 \), then \( n = 8 \)

- If \( m = 6 \), then \( n = 4 \)
- If \( m = 8 \), then \( n = 3 \)
- If \( m = 12 \), then \( n = 2 \)

Thus, the possible values for \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. There are 7 such values.

"To determine how many 5-segment coins Hiroly has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of 10-segment coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of 5-segment coins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 segments.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \) (since each 10-segment coin is worth 10 segments and each 5-segment coin is worth 5 segments)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):
\[ 4 + y = 11 \]
\[ y = 11 - 4 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

"To find the maximum \( x \) value at which the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect, we start by analyzing the given functions:

First, we observe that the terms \( e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} \), \( \binom{22 + 735235 |\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356} \), and \( \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) \) are identical in both functions. Therefore, the difference between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) simplifies to:

\[ f(x) - g(x) = (3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1) - (4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13) = -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12 \]

We need to find the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = g(x) \), which is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial:

\[ -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12 = 0 \]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term \(-12\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \(-1\), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

Let's test these possible roots:

For \( x = 1 \):
\[ -1^3 + 5(1)^2 + 8(1) - 12 = -1 + 5 + 8 - 12 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is a root.

We can factor \( -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12 \) as \( (x - 1)(-x^2 + 4x + 12) \). We can further factor \( -x^2 + 4x + 12 \) as \( -(x - 6)(x + 2) \). Therefore, the polynomial factors completely as:
\[ -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12 = -(x - 1)(x - 6)(x + 2) \]

The roots of the polynomial are \( x = 1 \), \( x = 6 \), and \( x = -2 \). The maximum of these roots is \( x = 6 \).

To ensure that these roots correspond to points where the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect, we need to check the behavior of the functions at these points. Since the functions are continuous and the polynomial changes sign at these roots, the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) do indeed intersect at \( x = 6 \).

Thus, the maximum \( x \) value at which the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum reduction in the total length of the loops after replacing the loops \(HC\) and \(HD\) with the loop \(HP\). The total length of the loops before the replacement is the sum of the lengths of \(HA\), \(HB\), \(HC\), and \(HD\). After the replacement, the total length is the sum of the lengths of \(HA\), \(HB\), and \(HP\).

First, we need to determine the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(O\). Since \(O\) is the origin \((0,0)\), we have:
- \(A = (1, 1)\)
- \(B = (-1.5, 0.3)\)
- \(C = (-1, -1)\)
- \(D = (1.5, -0.3)\)

Next, we calculate the lengths of the loops \(HC\), \(HD\), and \(HP\). The length of \(HC\) is given as 150 meters, and the length of \(HD\) is given as 130 meters. The length of \(HP\) is the distance from \(H\) to \(P\), which lies on the line segment \(CD\).

The coordinates of \(H\) are \((0, 2.5)\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \((-1, -1)\) and the coordinates of \(D\) are \((1.5, -0.3)\). The equation of the line \(CD\) can be found using the two-point form of the equation of a line:
\[
y + 1 = \frac{-0.3 - (-1)}{1.5 - (-1)}(x + 1) \implies y + 1 = \frac{0.7}{2.5}(x + 1) \implies y + 1 = \frac{7}{25}(x + 1) \implies y = \frac{7}{25}x + \frac{32}{25}
\]

Let the coordinates of \(P\) be \((x, y)\). Since \(P\) lies on the line \(CD\), we have:
\[
y = \frac{7}{25}x + \frac{32}{25}

The length of \(HP\) is:
\[
HP = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{7}{25}x + \frac{32}{25} - 2.5\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{7}{25}x + \frac{32}{25} - \frac{62.5}{25}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{7}{25}x - \frac{30.5}{25}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{7x - 30.5}{25}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{(7x - 30.5)^2}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{625x^2 + (7x - 30.5)^2}}{25} = \frac{\sqrt{625x^2 + 49x^2 - 427x + 930.25}}{25} = \frac{\sqrt{674x^2 - 427x + 930.25}}{25}
\]

To minimize \(HP\), we need to find the value of \(x\) that minimizes the expression inside the square root. The minimum value of a quadratic function \(ax^2 + bx + c\) occurs at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Here, \(a = 674\), \(b = -427\), and \(c = 930.25\), so:
\[
x = \frac{427}{2 \cdot 674} = \frac{427}{1348} = \frac{7}{22}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{7}{22}\) back into the equation of the line \(CD\):
\[
y = \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{7}{22} + \frac{32}{25} = \frac{49}{550} + \frac{32}{25} = \frac{49}{550} + \frac{704}{550} = \frac{753}{550}
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \(P\) are \(\left(\frac{7}{22}, \frac{753}{550}\right)\). The length of \(HP\) is:
\[
HP = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{22}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{753}{550} - 2.5\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{22}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{753}{550} - \frac{1375}{550}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{22}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{622}{550}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{22}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{311}{275}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{484} + \frac{96721}{75625}} = \sqrt{\frac{49 \cdot 75625 + 96721 \cdot 484}{484 \cdot 75625}} = \sqrt{\frac{3672625 + 46726244}{36625000}} = \sqrt{\frac{50408869}{36625000}} = \frac{\sqrt{50408869}}{6050} \approx 140

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Poool and Jeness is even, we first need to identify the parity (odd or even nature) of the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, only one number is even (2), and the rest are odd (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

Pool and Jeness each select one of these six prime numbers randomly. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Therefore, we need to consider the following two scenarios:

1. Both Poool and Jeness select odd numbers.
2. Both Poool and Jeness select the even number.

First, let's calculate the probability of each scenario.

**Scenario 1: Both Poool and Jeness select odd numbers.**

There are 5 odd numbers out of the 6 prime numbers. The probability that Poool selects an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jeness selects an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Poool and Jeness select odd numbers is:

**Scenario 2: Both Poool and Jeness select the even number.**

There is only 1 even number out of the 6 prime numbers. The probability that Poool selects the even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and the probability that Jeness selects the even number is also \(\frac{1}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Poool and Jeness select the even number is:

\[ PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2PM^2 + 2QM^2 \]

"To find the distinct rational roots of the polynomial \(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (here, 1) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (here, 2).

The constant term is 1, so the possible values for \( p \) are \( \pm 1 \).
The leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values for \( q \) are \( \pm 1, \pm 2 \).

Therefore, the possible rational roots are:
\[ \frac{p}{q} = \frac{\pm 1}{\pm 1} = \pm 1 \]
\[ \frac{p}{q} = \frac{\pm 1}{\pm 2} = \pm \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\), we start by considering the function \(f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\).

First, we will analyze the behavior of the function by considering specific values of \(x\) and \(y\). Let's start with \(y = 0\):
\[ f(x, 0) = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}. \]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \(g(x) = \frac{x}{x^4 + 6}\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(g(x)\) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = \frac{(x^4 + 6) - x(4x^3)}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{x^4 + 6 - 4x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{6 - 3x^4}{(x^4 + 6)^2}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ 6 - 3x^4 = 0 \implies x^4 = 2 \implies x = \sqrt[4]{2}. \]
We now evaluate \(g(x)\) at \(x = \sqrt[4]{2}\):
\[ g(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{(\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}. \]
To confirm that this is a maximum, we can check the second derivative or the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches \(\pm \infty\). As \(x \to \infty\) or \(x \to -\infty\), \(g(x) \to 0\), so the critical point at \(x = \sqrt[4]{2}\) is indeed a maximum.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(\frac{x}{x^4 + 6}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\).

Next, we need to check if this maximum value can be exceeded by considering other values of \(y\). Let's consider the case when \(x = 0\):
\[ f(0, y) = \frac{-y}{y^4 + 6}. \]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \(h(y) = \frac{-y}{y^4 + 6}\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(h(y)\) and set it to zero:
\[ h'(y) = \frac{-(y^4 + 6) + y(4y^3)}{(y^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{-y^4 - 6 + 4y^4}{(y^4 + 6)^2} = \frac{3y^4 - 6}{(y^4 + 6)^2}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ 3y^4 - 6 = 0 \implies y^4 = 2 \implies y = \sqrt[4]{2}. \]
We now evaluate \(h(y)\) at \(y = \sqrt[4]{2}\):
\[ h(\sqrt[4]{2}) = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{(\sqrt[4]{2})^4 + 6} = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{2 + 6} = \frac{-\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}. \]

"To find \( p(0) + p(4) \) for the polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 4 with roots 1, 2, and 3, we can express \( p(x) \) in the form:

\[ p(x) = a(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-r) \]

where \( a \) is a constant and \( r \) is the fourth root of the polynomial. We need to determine the value of \( a \) and \( r \), but since the problem does not provide enough information to find \( r \), we can use the fact that the polynomial is of degree 4 and has the given roots to simplify our calculation.

First, let's expand the polynomial \( (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-r) \). We can start by expanding \( (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \):

\[ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) = (x-1)(x^2-5x+6) = x^3-5x^2+6x-x^2+5x-6 = x^3-6x^2+11x-6 \]

Now, we multiply this result by \( (x-r) \):

\[ p(x) = a(x^3-6x^2+11x-6)(x-r) = a(x^4-rx^3-6x^3+6rx^2+11x^2-11rx-6x+6r) = a(x^4-(r+6)x^3+(6r+11)x^2-(11r+6)x+6r) \]

We are interested in finding \( p(0) + p(4) \). First, we evaluate \( p(0) \):

\[ p(0) = a(0^4-(r+6)0^3+(6r+11)0^2-(11r+6)0+6r) = 6ar \]

Next, we evaluate \( p(4) \):

\[ p(4) = a(4^4-(r+6)4^3+(6r+11)4^2-(11r+6)4+6r) = a(256-256r-384+96r+176-44r-24+6r) = a(16-100r) \]

Now, we add \( p(0) \) and \( p(4) \):

\[ p(0) + p(4) = 6ar + a(16-100r) = a(16-94r) \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( r \), we cannot determine the exact value of \( p(0) + p(4) \). However, if we assume that the polynomial is monic (i.e., \( a = 1 \)), then the answer is:

\[ p(0) + p(4) = 16 - 94r \]

But without the value of \( r \), the problem is not solvable in the general form. If we assume the polynomial is monic and the fourth root is not specified, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \] (if \( r = 0 \)) or \( \boxed{16 - 94r} \) (if \( r \) is not specified). However, the most likely answer based on the problem's context is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",24,"[24, '24']",False
"To solve the equation \(441 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = x\), we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the product \(2(21)(19)\).
2. Add the results of \(441\), \(2(21)(19)\), and \(361\) together.

First, let's calculate the product \(2(21)(19)\):
\[
2(21) = 42
\]
\[
42(19) = 42 \times 19
\]
To find \(42 \times 19\), we can use the distributive property:
\[
42 \times 19 = 42 \times (20 - 1) = 42 \times 20 - 42 \times 1 = 840 - 42 = 798
\]
So, \(2(21)(19) = 798\).

Now, we add \(441\), \(798\), and \(361\) together:
\[
441 + 798 = 1239
\]
\[
1239 + 361 = 1600

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{1600}\).

\[
441 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = (21 + 19)^2 = 40^2 = 1600

"To determine the number of possible integer values of \( x \) such that \( x^3 \) is a positive factor of \( 10! \), we start by finding the prime factorization of \( 10! \). The factorial of 10 is calculated as follows:
\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800.
\]
Next, we find the prime factorization of 3628800:
\[
10! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7.
\]
For \( x^3 \) to be a factor of \( 10! \), the prime factorization of \( x^3 \) must be a subset of the prime factorization of \( 10! \). If \( x \) has the prime factorization \( x = 2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c \times 7^d \times \cdots \), then \( x^3 = 2^{3a} \times 3^{3b} \times 5^{3c} \times 7^{3d} \times \cdots \). For \( x^3 \) to be a factor of \( 10! \), we must have:
\[
3a \leq 8, \quad 3b \leq 4, \quad 3c \leq 2, \quad 3d \leq 1, \quad \text{and so on}.

This gives us the following constraints on \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):
\[

Therefore, \( a \) can be 0, 1, or 2 (3 choices), \( b \) can be 0 or 1 (2 choices), \( c \) can be 0 (1 choice), and \( d \) can be 0 (1 choice). The total number of possible integer values for \( x \) is the product of the number of choices for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 6 girls and 2 boys in a single row such that the two boys are seated next to each other, we can treat the two boys as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 7 units (the block of two boys and the 6 girls) in a row.

Step 1: Arrange the 7 units.
The number of ways to arrange 7 units in a row is given by the factorial of 7, which is \(7!\):
\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

Step 2: Arrange the two boys within their block.
Within their block, the two boys can switch places, so there are \(2!\) ways to arrange the two boys:
\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2

Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 7 units by the number of ways to arrange the two boys within their block.
\[

"To find the value of \( x \) such that the arithmetic mean of the numbers 7, 2, \( x \), and 10 is 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the arithmetic mean**: The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we have four numbers, so the arithmetic mean is given by:
   \[
   \text{Arithmetic Mean} = \frac{7 + 2 + x + 10}{4}
   \]
2. **Set up the equation**: We know that the arithmetic mean is 9, so we can write:

3. **Eliminate the denominator**: To clear the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the conversion rates between the different types of units and then use these rates to find out how many daupps correspond to 42バups.

First, let's find the conversion rate from daupps to yapups. We know that:
\[ 4 \text{ daupps} = 7 \text{ yapups} \]
So, the conversion rate from daupps to yapups is:
\[ \text{Conversion rate from daupps to yapups} = \frac{7}{4} \text{ yapups per dauppp} \]

Next, let's find the conversion rate from yapups toバups. We know that:
\[ 5 \text{ yapups} = 3 \text{バups} \]
So, the conversion rate from yapups toバups is:
\[ \text{Conversion rate from yapups toバups} = \frac{3}{5} \text{バups per yapup} \]

Now, we can find the conversion rate from daupps toバups by multiplying the two conversion rates together:
\[ \text{Conversion rate from daupps toバups} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \text{ yapups per dauppp} \right) \times \left( \frac{3}{5} \text{バups per yapup} \right) = \frac{7 \times 3}{4 \times 5} \text{バups per dauppp} = \frac{21}{20} \text{バups per dauppp} \]

Now, we need to find out how many daupps correspond to 42バups. We can do this by dividing 42バups by the conversion rate from daupps toバups:
\[ \text{Number of daupps} = \frac{42 \text{バups}}{\frac{21}{20} \text{バups per dauppp}} = 42 \times \frac{20}{21} \text{ daupps} = 40 \text{ daupps} \]

"To solve for \( N \) given the conditions, we start by expressing the problem mathematically. We know that when \( N \) students are divided into groups of 8, there are 5 students left over. This can be written as:
\[ N \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]
This means that \( N \) can be expressed in the form:
\[ N = 8k + 5 \]
for some integer \( k \).

We also know that when \( N \) students are divided into groups of 6, there are 3 students left over. This can be written as:
\[ N \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]
This means that \( N \) can be expressed in the form:
\[ N = 6m + 3 \]
for some integer \( m \).

Since both expressions represent \( N \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 8k + 5 = 6m + 3 \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 8k - 6m = -2 \]
or
\[ 4k - 3m = -1 \]

We need to find integer solutions to this equation. Let's try different values for \( k \) and see if we can find a corresponding integer \( m \).

If \( k = 2 \):
\[ 4(2) - 3m = -1 \]
\[ 8 - 3m = -1 \]
\[ 9 = 3m \]
\[ m = 3 \]

So, \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 3 \) is a solution. Substituting \( k = 2 \) back into the expression for \( N \):
\[ N = 8(2) + 5 = 16 + 5 = 21 \]

To verify, we check the conditions:
- When \( N = 21 \), dividing by 8 gives \( 2 \) groups of 8 and a remainder of \( 5 \), so \( 21 \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \).
- When \( N = 21 \), dividing by 6 gives \( 3 \) groups of 6 and a remainder of \( 3 \), so \( 21 \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \).

Since both conditions are satisfied, \( N = 21 \) is a valid solution. To find all possible values of \( N \) less than 50, we note that the general solution to the equation \( 4k - 3m = -1 \) is given by:
\[ k = 2 + 3t \]
\[ m = 3 + 4t \]
for any integer \( t \). Substituting \( k = 2 + 3t \) into the expression for \( N \):
\[ N = 8(2 + 3t) + 5 = 16 + 24t + 5 = 21 + 24t \]

We need \( N < 50 \):
\[ 21 + 24t < 50 \]
\[ 24t < 29 \]
\[ t < \frac{29}{24} \]
\[ t < 1.2083 \]

Since \( t \) is an integer, the possible values for \( t \) are \( t = 0 \) and \( t = 1 \). Therefore, the possible values for \( N \) are:
\[ N = 21 + 24(0) = 21 \]
\[ N = 21 + 24(1) = 45 \]

"To determine the probability that Arithmetic wins the game, we need to analyze the sequence of coin tosses and the conditions under which Arithmetic wins. Let's denote the probability that Arithmetic wins the game as \( P \).

Arithmetic starts the game. There are two possible outcomes for the first coin toss:
1. Arithmetic wins the first coin toss (with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \)). In this case, Arithmetic wins the game immediately.
2. Arithmetic loses the first coin toss (with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \)). In this case, the game continues with Bob's turn. Bob wins the game if he wins the next coin toss (with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \)), or if he loses the next coin toss but Arithmetic wins the subsequent coin toss (with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \)). Therefore, the probability that Arithmetic wins the game after Bob's turn is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).

Since Arithmetic's turn follows Bob's turn, the probability that Arithmetic wins the game after Bob's turn is the same as the probability that Arithmetic wins the game, which is \( P \). Therefore, we can write the equation for \( P \) as:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} \times P \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{8} P \]
To isolate \( P \), we subtract \( \frac{3}{8} P \) from both sides:
\[ P - \frac{3}{8} P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{5}{8} P = \frac{1}{2} \]
To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{8}{5} \):
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \]

"To find the remainder when the polynomial \( P(x) = (5x + 9)^{611} + (x + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1 \) is divided by \( x + 2 \), we can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \( P(x) \) by \( x - c \) is \( P(c) \). In this case, we need to find \( P(-2) \).

Let's substitute \( x = -2 \) into the polynomial \( P(x) \):

\[
P(-2) = (5(-2) + 9)^{611} + ((-2) + 5)^{11} + ((-2) - 1)^{11} + 3(-2)^2 + 1
\]

First, we simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
5(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1
\]
\[
(-2) + 5 = 3
\]
\[
(-2) - 1 = -3
\]
\[
3(-2)^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( P(-2) \):

\[
P(-2) = (-1)^{611} + 3^{11} + (-3)^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

Next, we evaluate each term:

\[
(-1)^{611} = -1 \quad \text{(since 611 is odd)}
\]
\[
(-3)^{11} = -3^{11} \quad \text{(since 11 is odd)}

So the expression becomes:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 3^{11} - 3^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

The \( 3^{11} \) terms cancel each other out:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 12 + 1 = 12

"Given that \(a, b, c, d\) are distinct complex numbers with \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 0\), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\).

First, note that since \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\), each of these complex numbers lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. The condition \(a + b + c + d = 0\) implies that the sum of these four points is at the origin.

We start by considering the geometric interpretation of the sum of these complex numbers. If \(a, b, c, d\) are the vertices of a quadrilateral inscribed in the unit circle and their sum is zero, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. This is because the centroid of the quadrilateral (which is the average of the vertices) is at the origin.

For a parallelogram inscribed in the unit circle, the vertices can be written as \(a, b, -a, -b\) (or any permutation thereof). Without loss of generality, we can assume \(a = e^{i\theta}\), \(b = e^{i\phi}\), \(c = e^{-i\theta}\), and \(d = e^{-i\phi}\).

Now, we need to evaluate the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\). Substituting the values of \(a, b, c, d\), we get:
\[
a + b = e^{i\theta} + e^{i\phi}, \quad a + c = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta, \quad a + d = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\phi} = 2\cos(\theta - \phi),
\]
\[
b + c = e^{i\phi} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos(\phi - \theta), \quad b + d = e^{i\phi} + e^{-i\phi} = 2\cos\phi, \quad c + d = e^{-i\theta} + e^{-i\phi} = 2\cos(\theta + \phi).
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |(e^{i\theta} + e^{i\phi})(2\cos\theta)(2\cos(\theta - \phi))(2\cos(\phi - \theta))(2\cos\phi)(2\cos(\theta + \phi))|.
\]

Since \(|e^{i\theta} + e^{i\phi}| = |e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\phi}| = 2|\cos\left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)|\), we have:
\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |(2\cos\left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right))^2 (2\cos(\theta - \phi))(2\cos\phi)(2\cos(\theta + \phi))|.
\]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = 16 |\cos\left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)|^2 |\cos(\theta - \phi)| |\cos\phi| |\cos(\theta + \phi)|.
\]

The maximum value of \(|\cos\left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)|^2\) is 1, and the maximum value of \(|\cos(\theta - \phi)|\) is 1. The maximum value of \(|\cos\phi|\) is 1, and the maximum value of \(|\cos(\theta + \phi)|\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is:
\[
16 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 16.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",0,"[0, '0']",False

Let's denote these vectors as \(\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). We need to find scalars \(a\) and \(b\) such that:
\[

From the third equation, we immediately get \(b = 2\). Substituting \(b = 2\) into the second equation, we get:

So, the solution is \(a = -1\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, we can write:

We know from the problem statement that:
\[

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\]

This can be separated into two equations:

\[
x = 8 + 2t,

\[
y = -1 + 3t.

We need to eliminate the parameter \( t \) to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \). First, solve the equation for \( x \) in terms of \( t \):

\[
x - 8 = 2t,

\[
t = \frac{x - 8}{2}.
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( t \) into the equation for \( y \):

\[
y = -1 + 3\left(\frac{x - 8}{2}\right).

Now, simplify the right-hand side:

"To determine how many of the first 100 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, or 5, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. This principle is useful for counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets, while avoiding the problem of double-counting.

Let's define the sets:
- Let \( A \) be the set of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3.
- Let \( B \) be the set of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 4.
- Let \( C \) be the set of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 5.

We want to find the number of integers in the union of these sets, \( |A \cup B \cup C| \). According to the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]

First, we calculate the number of elements in each set:
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{3} \right\rfloor = 33 \). So, \( |A| = 33 \).
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 4 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{4} \right\rfloor = 25 \). So, \( |B| = 25 \).
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 5 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor = 20 \). So, \( |C| = 20 \).

Next, we calculate the number of elements in the intersections of the sets:
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 4 (i.e., by 12) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{12} \right\rfloor = 8 \). So, \( |A \cap B| = 8 \).
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., by 15) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{15} \right\rfloor = 6 \). So, \( |A \cap C| = 6 \).
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by both 4 and 5 (i.e., by 20) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{20} \right\rfloor = 5 \). So, \( |B \cap C| = 5 \).
- The number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5 (i.e., by 60) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{60} \right\rfloor = 1 \). So, \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 1 \).

Now, we substitute these values into the Inclusion-Exclusion formula:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = 33 + 25 + 20 - 8 - 6 - 5 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3, 4, or 5 is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",1,"[1, '1']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) such that when it is cubed, the result is \( 912,673 \). Let's start by finding the cube root of \( 912,673 \).

First, we estimate the cube root of \( 912,673 \). Since \( 912,673 \) is a six-digit number, its cube root will be a two-digit number. We know that:

\[ 10^3 = 1000 \]
\[ 100^3 = 1,000,000 \]

So, the cube root of \( 912,673 \) must be between 10 and 100. Let's try to narrow it down by testing some values.

First, let's try \( 90 \):

\[ 90^3 = 90 \times 90 \times 90 = 729,000 \]

Since \( 729,000 \) is less than \( 912,673 \), let's try \( 95 \):

\[ 95^3 = 95 \times 95 \times 95 = 857,375 \]

Since \( 857,375 \) is still less than \( 912,673 \), let's try \( 96 \):

\[ 96^3 = 96 \times 96 \times 96 = 884,736 \]

Since \( 884,736 \) is still less than \( 912,673 \), let's try \( 97 \):

\[ 97^3 = 97 \times 97 \times 97 = 912,673 \]

Since \( 912,673 \) is equal to \( 912,673 \), the cube root of \( 912,673 \) is \( 97 \). Therefore, the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is \( 97 \).

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits \( A \) and \( B \). Here, \( A = 9 \) and \( B = 7 \), so:

\[ A + B = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Thus, the value of \( A + B \) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",16,"[16, '16']",True
"To determine the total area of the regions where the grid lines intersect (the ""filling"" parts), we need to analyze the given figure and count the number of intersection points.

First, let's identify the grid lines and their intersections:
- There are 3 vertical grid lines (from \(x=0\) to \(x=3\)).
- There are 4 horizontal grid lines (from \(y=0\) to \(y=3\)).

The intersection points of these grid lines form a grid of smaller squares. Each intersection point is the intersection of one vertical line and one horizontal line. Since there are 3 vertical lines and 4 horizontal lines, the number of intersection points is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Each intersection point is a vertex of a small square, and each small square has an area of \(1 \times 1 = 1\). Therefore, the total area of the regions where the grid lines intersect is the number of intersection points, which is 12.

"To determine how many questions Fourier answered correctly, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of questions Fourier answered correctly.
- Let \( y \) be the number of questions Fourier answered incorrectly.
- Let \( z \) be the number of questions Fourier did not answer.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Fourier answered a total of 80 questions, so \( x + y + z = 80 \).
2. Fourier received a total of 232 points, and each correct answer gives 5 points while each incorrect answer deducts 2 points. Therefore, \( 5x - 2y = 232 \).

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 80 \)
2. \( 5x - 2y = 232 \)

Since \( z \) is not needed to find \( x \) and \( y \), we can focus on the first two equations. We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) from the second equation:
\[ 5x - 2y = 232 \]
\[ -2y = 232 - 5x \]
\[ y = \frac{5x - 232}{2} \]

Next, we substitute \( y \) into the first equation:
\[ x + \frac{5x - 232}{2} + z = 80 \]

Since \( z \) is not necessary to find \( x \), we can simplify the equation by eliminating \( z \):
\[ x + \frac{5x - 232}{2} = 80 \]

To clear the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2x + 5x - 232 = 160 \]
\[ 7x - 232 = 160 \]
\[ 7x = 392 \]
\[ x = 56 \]

So, Fourier answered \( x = 56 \) questions correctly. To verify, we can find \( y \) and \( z \):
\[ y = \frac{5(56) - 232}{2} = \frac{280 - 232}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
\[ z = 80 - x - y = 80 - 56 - 24 = 0 \]

The calculations confirm that Fourier answered 56 questions correctly, 24 questions incorrectly, and 0 questions without answering. Therefore, the number of questions Fourier answered correctly is \(\boxed{56}\).","[56, '56']",56,"[56, '56']",True
"To evaluate the sum \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\), where \(F_n\) is the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number with \(F_0 = 0\) and \(F_1 = 1\), we start by using the identity for Fibonacci numbers that relates \(F_{n+2}\) to \(F_{n+1}\) and \(F_n\):
\[F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\]
We can rewrite the general term of the sum as:
\[\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)}.\]
We can decompose this fraction using partial fractions:
\[\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{A}{F_n} + \frac{B}{F_{n+1} + F_n}.\]
To find \(A\) and \(B\), we solve the equation:
\[F_{n+1} = A (F_{n+1} + F_n) + B F_n.\]
By comparing coefficients, we get:
\[A = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad A + B = 0 \implies B = -1.\]
Thus, we have:
\[\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+1} + F_n} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}}.\]
Therefore, the sum becomes a telescoping series:
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}} \right).\]
In a telescoping series, most terms cancel out. Writing out the first few terms, we get:
\[\left( \frac{1}{F_1} - \frac{1}{F_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_2} - \frac{1}{F_4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_3} - \frac{1}{F_5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_4} - \frac{1}{F_6} \right) + \cdots.\]
All intermediate terms cancel, leaving:
\[\frac{1}{F_1} + \frac{1}{F_2} = 1 + \frac{1}{1} = 2.\]

"To determine the number of students who are physics students, we will use the information given and set up a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( P \) be the number of students who are physics students.
- Let \( C \) be the number of students who are chemistry students.
- Let \( D \) be the number of students who are differential calculus students.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The total number of students is 360.
2. 15 students are taking all three subjects.
3. 15 students are taking none of the subjects.
4. 180 students are taking differential calculus.
5. The number of students taking chemistry is twice the number of students taking physics.
6. 75 students are taking both differential calculus and chemistry.
7. 75 students are taking both differential calculus and physics.
8. 30 students are taking both differential calculus and physics.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:

1. \( D + C + P - (D \cap C) - (D \cap P) - (C \cap P) + (D \cap C \cap P) = 345 \) (since 15 students are taking none of the subjects, 360 - 15 = 345 students are taking at least one subject)
2. \( D = 180 \)
3. \( C = 2P \)
4. \( (D \cap C) = 75 \)
5. \( (D \cap P) = 75 \)
6. \( (D \cap C \cap P) = 15 \)

Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:

\[ 180 + C + P - 75 - 75 - (C \cap P) + 15 = 345 \]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[ 150 + C + P - (C \cap P) = 345 \]

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get:

\[ C + P - (C \cap P) = 195 \]

Since \( C = 2P \), we substitute \( C \) with \( 2P \):

\[ 2P + P - (C \cap P) = 195 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3P - (C \cap P) = 195 \]

We also know that \( (C \cap P) = (C \cap P) \), so we need to find \( (C \cap P) \). We can use the fact that the number of students taking both differential calculus and chemistry is 75, and the number of students taking both differential calculus and physics is 75. The number of students taking both differential calculus and physics and chemistry is \( (C \cap P) \).

Since the number of students taking both differential calculus and chemistry is 75, and the number of students taking both differential calculus and physics is 75, the number of students taking both differential calculus and physics and chemistry is 75.

Therefore, we have:

\[ 3P - 75 = 195 \]

Adding 75 to both sides, we get:

\[ 3P = 270 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ P = 90 \]

So, the number of students who are physics students is \(\boxed{90}\).","[90, '90']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"To find the value of \(x^3 - 2x + 1\) given that \(x\) satisfies the equation \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\), we can use the given equation to express higher powers of \(x\) in terms of lower powers.

First, we start with the given equation:
\[x^2 = x + 1.\]

Next, we need to express \(x^3\) in terms of \(x\) and \(x^2\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation \(x^2 = x + 1\) by \(x\):

Now, we substitute \(x^2\) with \(x + 1\) in the expression for \(x^3\):
\[x^3 = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1.\]

We are asked to find the value of \(x^3 - 2x + 1\). Substituting the expression for \(x^3\) that we just found, we get:

- 1 tolinull is equivalent to 4 binull.
- 3 binull is equivalent to 7 degrees.

First, we need to find out how many binull are equivalent to 56 degrees. We know that 3 binull is equivalent to 7 degrees, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of binull equivalent to 56 degrees.

\[
\frac{3 \text{ binull}}{7 \text{ degrees}} = \frac{x \text{ binull}}{56 \text{ degrees}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{3 \text{ binull} \times 56 \text{ degrees}}{7 \text{ degrees}} = \frac{168 \text{ binull} \cdot \text{degrees}}{7 \text{ degrees}} = 24 \text{ binull}
\]

Now that we know that 56 degrees is equivalent to 24 binull, we need to convert binull to tolinull. We know that 1 tolinull is equivalent to 4 binull, so we can set up another proportion to find the number of tolinulls equivalent to 24 binull.

\[
\frac{1 \text{ tolinull}}{4 \text{ binull}} = \frac{y \text{ tolinulls}}{24 \text{ binull}}
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{1 \text{ tolinull} \times 24 \text{ binull}}{4 \text{ binull}} = \frac{24 \text{ tolinulls} \cdot \text{binull}}{4 \text{ binull}} = 6 \text{ tolinulls}

Therefore, any multiple of 450 must be even and end in 00, 50, or 75. Since the digits must be either 0 or 1, the multiple must end in 00.

We need to find the smallest \(n\) such that \(100 \times \frac{10^n - 1}{9}\) is divisible by 450.

Since \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\) and \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\), \(\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\) must be divisible by 3^2 = 9.

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

The finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of this decimal number. The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,

\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), but a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

3. Calculate the result.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
(3x-2)(4x+1)-(3x-2)4x+1
\]

First, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms. Notice that \(-(3x-2)4x\) can be rewritten as \(-12x^2 + 8x\). So the expression becomes:
\[
(3x-2)(4x+1) - 12x^2 + 8x + 1
\]

Next, we expand \((3x-2)(4x+1)\):
\[
(3x-2)(4x+1) = 3x \cdot 4x + 3x \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 4x - 2 \cdot 1 = 12x^2 + 3x - 8x - 2 = 12x^2 - 5x - 2

Now substitute this back into the expression:

Combine like terms:
\[

1. Each ball has 2 choices (it can go into either of the two boxes).
2. There are 5 balls, and each ball has 2 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is \(2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^5\).

"To find the volume of the region \( S \) defined by the condition \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 36 \), we first need to determine the distances \( d_1, d_2, \) and \( d_3 \) from a point \( P = (x, y, z) \) to the planes \( x - z = 0 \), \( x - 2y + z = 0 \), and \( x + y + z = 0 \), respectively.

The distance from a point \( (x, y, z) \) to a plane \( ax + by + cz + d = 0 \) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|ax + by + cz + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}.
\]

For the plane \( x - z = 0 \), the distance \( d_1 \) is:
\[
d_1 = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

For the plane \( x - 2y + z = 0 \), the distance \( d_2 \) is:
\[
d_2 = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

For the plane \( x + y + z = 0 \), the distance \( d_3 \) is:
\[
d_3 = \frac{|x + y + z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|x + y + z|}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The condition \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 36 \) becomes:
\[
\left( \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{6}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{|x + y + z|}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = 36.
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{(x - z)^2}{2} + \frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6} + \frac{(x + y + z)^2}{3} = 36.
\]

To eliminate the absolute values, we consider the case where \( x - z \geq 0 \), \( x - 2y + z \geq 0 \), and \( x + y + z \geq 0 \). The equation then becomes:
\[
\frac{(x - z)^2}{2} + \frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6} + \frac{(x + y + z)^2}{3} = 36.

To find the semi-axes \( a, b, \) and \( c \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form.

"To find the maximum value of \( e \) given the conditions \( a + b + c + d + e = 8 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 16 \), we can start by expressing \( a + b + c + d \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) in terms of \( e \).

From the first condition, we have:
\[ a + b + c + d = 8 - e. \]

From the second condition, we have:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 16 - e^2. \]

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the sum of the variables to the sum of their squares. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:
\[ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \geq (a + b + c + d)^2. \]

Substituting the expressions we have, we get:
\[ (16 - e^2) \cdot 4 \geq (8 - e)^2. \]

Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 64 - 4e^2. \]

So the inequality becomes:
\[ 64 - 4e^2 \geq (8 - e)^2. \]

Expanding the right side, we get:
\[ 64 - 4e^2 \geq 64 - 16e + e^2. \]

Subtracting 64 from both sides, we get:
\[ -4e^2 \geq -16e + e^2. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

Factoring out \( e \), we get:
\[ e(16 - 5e) \geq 0. \]

"To determine the current age of Creus, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( E \) be the current age of Emily.
- Let \( B \) be the current age of Ben.
- Let \( C \) be the current age of Creus.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The average age of Emily, Ben, and Creus is 6 years.
2. Four years ago, Creus was the same age as Emily is now.
3. Four years from now, Ben's age will be \(\frac{3}{5}\) of Emily's age at that time.

We can translate these statements into equations:

1. \(\frac{E + B + C}{3} = 6\)
2. \(C - 4 = E\)
3. \(B + 4 = \frac{3}{5}(E + 4)\)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[
E + B + C = 18
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(E + B + C = 18\)
2. \(C = E + 4\)
3. \(B + 4 = \frac{3}{5}(E + 4)\)

We can substitute the expression for \(C\) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
E + B + (E + 4) = 18
\]
\[
2E + B + 4 = 18
\]
\[
2E + B = 14
\]

Next, we substitute the expression for \(B\) from the third equation:
\[
B = \frac{3}{5}(E + 4) - 4
\]
\[
B = \frac{3}{5}E + \frac{12}{5} - 4
\]
\[
B = \frac{3}{5}E + \frac{12}{5} - \frac{20}{5}
\]
\[
B = \frac{3}{5}E - \frac{8}{5}
\]

Now substitute this expression for \(B\) into the equation \(2E + B = 14\):
\[
2E + \left(\frac{3}{5}E - \frac{8}{5}\right) = 14
\]
\[
2E + \frac{3}{5}E - \frac{8}{5} = 14
\]
\[
\frac{10}{5}E + \frac{3}{5}E - \frac{8}{5} = 14
\]
\[
\frac{13}{5}E - \frac{8}{5} = 14
\]
\[
\frac{13}{5}E = 14 + \frac{8}{5}
\]
\[
\frac{13}{5}E = \frac{70}{5} + \frac{8}{5}
\]
\[
\frac{13}{5}E = \frac{78}{5}
\]
\[
13E = 78

\[
E = 6

Now that we have Emily's age, we can find Ben's and Creus's ages. Using \(C = E + 4\):
\[
C = 6 + 4 = 10

And using \(B = \frac{3}{5}E - \frac{8}{5}\):
\[
B = \frac{3}{5}(6) - \frac{8}{5} = \frac{18}{5} - \frac{8}{5} = \frac{10}{5} = 2

"Given that \(\omega\) is a 1998th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{1998} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The 1998th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{1998} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{1997} + x^{1996} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the non-1 roots of unity, including \(\omega\), satisfy the equation \(x^{1997} + x^{1996} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the sum:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.
\]

First, consider the general term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1 + \omega^{1998-k}}{1 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k} + \omega^{1997}} = \frac{1 + \omega^{1998-k}}{1 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k} + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^{1998-k}}{2 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k}}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of linear expressions involving roots of unity. We know that:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1998-k}} = \frac{(1 + \omega^{1998-k}) + (1 + \omega^k)}{(1 + \omega^k)(1 + \omega^{1998-k})} = \frac{2 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k}}{1 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k} + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k}}{2 + \omega^k + \omega^{1998-k}} = 1.
\]

Thus, the sum can be paired as:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}} \right) + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1000}} \right).
\]

Since there are 1997 terms in the sum, and each pair sums to 1, we have 998 pairs plus the middle term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{999}}\). However, \(\omega^{999}\) is also a 1998th root of unity, and the sum of all 1998th roots of unity except 1 is \(-1\). Therefore, the middle term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{999}}\) is not included in the sum of the pairs, and the sum of all pairs is 998.

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( c \) units results in the function \( f(x+c) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \).

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

So, \(0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(0.\overline{4}\) to a fraction
Let \(y = 0.\overline{4}\). Then, \(10y = 4.\overline{4}\). Subtracting the original \(y\) from this equation, we get:
\[10y - y = 4.\overline{4} - 0.\overline{4} \implies 9y = 4 \implies y = \frac{4}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{9}\).

### Step 3: Convert \(0.\overline{2}\) to a fraction

\[

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[

So, we have:

\[
(xyz)^2 = 82944
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = \sqrt{82944} = 288
\]

Now that we have the value of \(xyz\), we can find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) by dividing \(xyz\) by each of the original equations. First, we find \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{xyz}{yz} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Next, we find \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{xyz}{xz} = \frac{288}{48} = 6
\]

Finally, we find \(z\):

\[
z = \frac{xyz}{xy} = \frac{288}{24} = 12
\]

Now that we have \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), and \(z = 12\), we can find \(x + y + z\):

\[
x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

Therefore, the value of \(x + y + z\) is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True
"To determine the values of \( x \) that are not in the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) for which the denominator is zero. The denominator is \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \). We need to solve the equation \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| = 0 \).

First, let's factor the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values:
\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = (x+4)(x-1) \]
\[ x^2 + 9x + 20 = (x+4)(x+5) \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ |(x+4)(x-1)| + |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \]

Since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, the sum of two absolute values is zero if and only if each absolute value is zero. Therefore, we need:
\[ |(x+4)(x-1)| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \]

This implies:
\[ (x+4)(x-1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (x+4)(x+5) = 0 \]

The solutions to these equations are:
\[ x = -4, \quad x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -5 \]

However, \( x = -4 \) is a common solution to both equations. Therefore, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( |(x+4)(x-1)| + |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \) are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Thus, the values of \( x \) that are not in the domain of the function \( f(x) \) are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 1 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the parallelograms formed by the given lines and then use the given areas to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).

First, consider the parallelogram formed by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax + d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx + d\). The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax + d\) is the same as the distance between the parallel lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx + d\). This distance is given by:
\[
\frac{|d - c|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} = \frac{|d - c|}{\sqrt{1 + b^2}}
\]
The distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = bx + c\) is:
\[
\frac{|b - a|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}
\]
The area of the parallelogram is the product of these two distances:
\[
\text{Area} = \left(\frac{|d - c|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}\right) \left(\frac{|b - a|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}\right) = \frac{|d - c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2}
\]
We are given that this area is 18:
\[
\frac{|d - c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 18
\]

Next, consider the parallelogram formed by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax - d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx - d\). The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax - d\) is the same as the distance between the parallel lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx - d\). This distance is given by:
\[
\frac{|-d - c|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}} = \frac{|d + c|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}
\]
The distance between the lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = bx + c\) is:
\[
\frac{|b - a|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}
\]
The area of the parallelogram is the product of these two distances:
\[
\text{Area} = \left(\frac{|d + c|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}\right) \left(\frac{|b - a|}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}\right) = \frac{|d + c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2}
\]
We are given that this area is 72:
\[
\frac{|d + c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 72
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(\frac{|d - c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 18\)
2. \(\frac{|d + c| |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 72\)

By dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:
\[
\frac{|d + c|}{|d - c|} = 4
\]
This implies that \(|d + c| = 4|d - c|\). Without loss of generality, we can assume \(d + c = 4(d - c)\), which simplifies to:
\[
d + c = 4d - 4c \implies 5c = 3d \implies d = \frac{5c}{3}
\]
Since \(d\) and \(c\) are positive integers, \(c\) must be a multiple of 3. Let \(c = 3k\), then \(d = 5k\). Substituting \(d = 5k\) and \(c = 3k\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
\frac{|5k - 3k| |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 18 \implies \frac{2k |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 18 \implies \frac{k |b - a|}{1 + a^2} = 9
\]
To minimize \(a + b + c + d\), we should choose the smallest possible values for \(a\) and \(b\). Let \(a = 2\), then:
\[
\frac{k |b - 2|}{1 + 2^2} = 9 \implies \frac{k |b - 2|}{5} = 9 \implies k |b - 2| = 45
\]
The smallest possible value for \(k\) is 1, so:
\[
|b - 2| = 45 \implies b = 47 \quad \text{(since \(b\) is positive)}
\]
Thus, \(a = 2\), \(b = 47\), \(c = 3\), and \(d = 5\). The minimum value of \(a + b + c + d\) is:

"To determine the measure of \(\angle PQR\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), and we are given the angles \(x^\circ\), \(2x^\circ\), and \(128^\circ\).

First, let's identify the relationship between the angles. Since \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), the angle \(x^\circ\) is an alternate interior angle to the angle formed by the line segment \(PR\) and the line \(QR\). Similarly, the angle \(2x^\circ\) is an alternate interior angle to the angle formed by the line segment \(PQ\) and the line \(QR\).

The angle \(128^\circ\) is an exterior angle to the triangle \(PQR\). The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, we can write:
\[
128^\circ = x^\circ + 2x^\circ
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
128^\circ = 3x^\circ
\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
x = \frac{128^\circ}{3}
\]

Now, we need to find the measure of \(\angle PQR\). The measure of \(\angle PQR\) is the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles \(x^\circ\) and \(2x^\circ\):
\[
\angle PQR = x^\circ + 2x^\circ = 3x^\circ = 128^\circ

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PQR\) is \(\boxed{128}\).","[128, '128']",116,"[116, '116']",False
"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(D\) from the origin to this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2}
\]
To minimize \(D\), it is equivalent to minimize \(D^2\):
\[
D^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\right)^2
\]
Expanding the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
D^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 9x^2 + 81\right)
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 8x^2 + 81
\]
Let \(u = x^2\). Then the expression becomes a quadratic function in terms of \(u\):
\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81
\]
To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we take the derivative with respect to \(u\) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{du}\left(\frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81\right) = \frac{1}{2}u - 8
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}u - 8 = 0 \implies u = 16
\]
Since \(u = x^2\), we have:
\[
x^2 = 16 \implies x = \pm 4
\]
We substitute \(x = 4\) (or \(x = -4\)) back into the original function to find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate:
\[
y = \frac{1}{2}(4)^2 - 9 = \frac{1}{2}(16) - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1
\]
Thus, the points on the graph closest to the origin are \((4, -1)\) and \((-4, -1)\). The distance from the origin to either of these points is:
\[
D = \sqrt{4^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}

"To determine the total amount of the investment after 5 years, we need to calculate the compound growth of the investment due to the interest added every 2 months. The investment grows by 1% every 2 months, and there are 5 years in total. Since there are 12 months in a year, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months in 5 years. Therefore, the number of times the investment grows by 1% is \(60 / 2 = 30\).

The formula for compound growth is given by:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \(P\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \(r\) is the interest rate per period.
- \(n\) is the number of periods.

In this problem:
- \(P = 24000\)
- \(r = 0.01\)
- \(n = 30\)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 24000 (1 + 0.01)^{30} \]
\[ A = 24000 (1.01)^{30} \]

Next, we need to calculate \((1.01)^{30}\). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.01)^{30} \approx 1.347848915 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount \(A\):
\[ A \approx 24000 \times 1.347848915 \]
\[ A \approx 32348.374 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

"To determine the length of the third side of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Let's denote the length of the third side by \( x \).

Given the lengths of the other two sides are 1 unit and 3 units, we can write the following inequalities based on the triangle inequality theorem:

1. \( 1 + 3 > x \)
2. \( 1 + x > 3 \)
3. \( 3 + x > 1 \)

Let's solve each inequality step by step:

1. \( 1 + 3 > x \)
   \[
   4 > x \quad \text{or} \quad x < 4
   \]

2. \( 1 + x > 3 \)

   \]

3. \( 3 + x > 1 \)
   \[
   x > 1 - 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x > -2
   \]
   Since \( x \) is a length, it must be positive, so this inequality is always true for any positive \( x \).

Combining the valid inequalities from above, we get:

2 < x < 4

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the only possible value for \( x \) is 3. Therefore, the length of the third side is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of the interior angles, excluding one angle, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles excluding one angle:**
   If we exclude one angle, the sum of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)}
   \]
   We know this sum is \(1070^\circ\), so we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the range for the excluded angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the excluded angle must be greater than \(0^\circ\) and less than \(180^\circ\).

4. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)} < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Since the excluded angle is less than \(180^\circ\), we can approximate:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the left inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-3) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-3
   \]
   \[
   5.9444 < n-3
   \]
   \[
   8.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 9
   \]

   Simplifying the right inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   This inequality is always true for any \(n\).

5. **Verify the solution:**
   We need to check if \(n = 9\) satisfies the original condition. If \(n = 9\), the total sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
   \]
   The sum of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   1260^\circ - \text{(one angle)} = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the excluded angle is:
   \[
   1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ
   \]
   Since \(190^\circ\) is less than \(180^\circ\), it is a valid angle for a convex polygon.

Therefore, we can write:

\[ f(x) = (x^2 - 1)q(x) + ax + b \]

\[ f(1) = -10 \]

\[ f(-1) = 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 10 \]

Since \( f(1) = a \cdot 1 + b = a + b \) and \( f(-1) = a \cdot (-1) + b = -a + b \), we have the system of equations:

p(x) = a(x - (4 - \sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \sqrt{11}))

We can simplify this expression by expanding the product:

\[
p(x) = a((x - 4) + \sqrt{11})((x - 4) - \sqrt{11}) = a((x - 4)^2 - (\sqrt{11})^2) = a(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11) = a(x^2 - 8x + 5)

\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 7 \\ -1 & -2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) - (-1)(7) = \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1.
\]

The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvalues of \(\mathbf{A}\). Solving \(\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Let \(\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). These eigenvalues are complex and satisfy \(\lambda_1 \lambda_2 = 1\).

Next, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\). For \(\lambda_1\), we solve \((\mathbf{A} - \lambda_1 \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = 0\):

\]

From the first row, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{5 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)x + 7y = 0 \implies x = \frac{-14y}{5 - i\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-14y(5 + i\sqrt{3})}{(5 - i\sqrt{3})(5 + i\sqrt{3})} = \frac{-14y(5 + i\sqrt{3})}{25 + 3} = \frac{-14y(5 + i\sqrt{3})}{28} = \frac{-y(5 + i\sqrt{3})}{2}.

So, an eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda_1\) is \(\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-5 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Similarly, for \(\lambda_2\), we solve \((\mathbf{A} - \lambda_2 \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = 0\):

So, an eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda_2\) is \(\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-5 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Since \(\mathbf{A}\) is diagonalizable, we can write \(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{P}^{-1}\), where \(\mathbf{D}\) is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\):

Then, \(\mathbf{A}^n = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D}^n \mathbf{P}^{-1}\). Since \(\lambda_1 \lambda_2 = 1\), we have \(\lambda_1^n = \frac{1}{\lambda_2^n}\). Therefore, \(\mathbf{D}^n = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1^n & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\lambda_2^n} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^n \end{pmatrix}\).

Thus,

\[
\mathbf{A}^n = \mathbf{P} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\lambda_2^n} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^n \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{P}^{-1}.
\]

We need to find \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\):

\[

\[
\mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{P} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\lambda_2^{40}} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2^{40} \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{P}^{-1}.

Since \(\lambda_2^{60} = 1\), we have \(\lambda_2^{27} = \lambda_2^{27}\), \(\lambda_2^{31} = \lambda_2^{31}\), and \(\lambda_2^{40} = \lambda_2^{40}\). Therefore,

\[

"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by understanding the condition given. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

According to the problem, \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \), so we have:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. To do this, we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x = -x \) modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for odd integer solutions, both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are valid. However, the problem asks for the odd integer solution, and both are odd, so we can choose either. The problem does not specify which one to choose, so we can choose the smaller one.

Thus, the odd integer solution is:

"To find the value of \(a + b + m\), we need to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) from the given information and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the \(x\)-intercept \(a\):**
   The \(x\)-intercept of a line is the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\). The equation of the line is given by:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1
   \]
   Substituting \(y = 0\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{x}{4} = 1 \implies x = 4
   \]
   Therefore, the \(x\)-intercept \(a\) is 4.

2. **Identify the \(y\)-intercept \(b\):**
   The \(y\)-intercept of a line is the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   \frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies y = 12
   \]
   Therefore, the \(y\)-intercept \(b\) is 12.

3. **Identify the slope \(m\):**
   The slope \(m\) of a line in the form \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\) is given by \(-\frac{b}{a}\). From the equation \(\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1\), we have \(a = 4\) and \(b = 12\). Therefore, the slope \(m\) is:
   \[
   m = -\frac{12}{4} = -3

4. **Calculate \(a + b + m\):**
   Now that we have \(a = 4\), \(b = 12\), and \(m = -3\), we can find \(a + b + m\):

   - There are 3 tracks: left fold, straight, and right fold.
   - Each track must have exactly one car.
   - The first car must be a left fold, and the second car must be a straight.

2. **Determine the possible arrangements**:
   - The first car is fixed as a left fold.
   - The second car is fixed as a straight.

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(4(x + 7)(2 - x)\), we start by expanding and rewriting the expression in a more convenient form. First, we expand the product \((x + 7)(2 - x)\):

\[
(x + 7)(2 - x) = 2x - x^2 + 14 - 7x = -x^2 - 5x + 14
\]

Next, we multiply this result by 4:

\[
4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56
\]

Now, we have a quadratic function in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a = -4\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 56\). Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative (\(a = -4\)), the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is found using the formula \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\):

\[
x = -\frac{-20}{2(-4)} = -\frac{20}{8} = -\frac{5}{2}

Next, we substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) back into the original expression to find the maximum value:

\[
4\left(-\frac{5}{2} + 7\right)\left(2 - \left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)\right) = 4\left(-\frac{5}{2} + \frac{14}{2}\right)\left(2 + \frac{5}{2}\right) = 4\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)\left(\frac{9}{2}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{81}{4} = 81

"To determine what fraction of 2 feet is 3 inches, we first need to convert 2 feet into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the number of inches in 2 feet as follows:

Now, we need to find what fraction of 24 inches is 3 inches. This can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ inches}}{24 \text{ inches}} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

\[ \frac{3 \div 3}{24 \div 3} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Therefore, 3 inches is \(\frac{1}{8}\) of 2 feet. The final answer is:

"To determine the number of different ways to choose 6 packs of quiche from three types of quiche (chocolate chip, automated milk, and piñata cookie dough) with at least 6 packs of each type available, we can use the ""stars and bars"" theorem. This theorem is useful for solving problems involving the distribution of indistinguishable objects into distinct groups.

The problem can be translated into finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6\), where \(x_1\) is the number of chocolate chip packs, \(x_2\) is the number of automated milk packs, and \(x_3\) is the number of piñata cookie dough packs.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n\) is given by \(\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\). In our case, \(n = 6\) and \(k = 3\), so we have:

\[
\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2}
\]

Now, we calculate \(\binom{8}{2}\):

\[
\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8!}{2!6!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6!}{2 \times 1 \times 6!} = \frac{8 \times 7}{2 \times 1} = 28

"To determine the type of curve defined by the equation \( r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4 \), we will convert this equation from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. Recall that in polar coordinates, \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \). Also, \( \cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} \) and \( \sin \theta = \frac{y}{r} \). Therefore, we have:

\[
\cos 2\theta = \left( \frac{x}{r} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{y}{r} \right)^2 = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the division by a fraction by multiplying by its reciprocal.
2. Multiply the fractions together.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}
\]

First, simplify \(\frac{12}{20}\). The greatest common divisor of 12 and 20 is 4, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
\[
\frac{12}{20} = \frac{12 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{3}{5}
\]

Next, convert the division by \(\frac{3}{5}\) into multiplication by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{5}\) is \(\frac{5}{3}\), so the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{3}

Now, multiply the fractions together. To do this, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[

\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{40}{105}\). The greatest common divisor of 40 and 105 is 5, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{40}{105} = \frac{40 \div 5}{105 \div 5} = \frac{8}{21}

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:

   V = s^3
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by the formula:

"Let's denote the number of yellow balls as \( y \) and the number of blue balls as \( b \). According to the problem, the initial ratio of blue balls to yellow balls is 4:3. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{b}{y} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

From this equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
b = \frac{4}{3}y
\]

Next, we are told that if we add 5 blue balls and remove 3 yellow balls, the new ratio of blue balls to yellow balls becomes 7:3. Therefore, the new number of blue balls is \( b + 5 \) and the new number of yellow balls is \( y - 3 \). The new ratio can be written as:

\[
\frac{b + 5}{y - 3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

Substituting \( b = \frac{4}{3}y \) into the new ratio equation, we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{4}{3}y + 5}{y - 3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

To eliminate the fraction in the numerator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{4y + 15}{y - 3} = 7
\]

Next, we eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( y - 3 \):

\[
4y + 15 = 7(y - 3)
\]

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

\[
4y + 15 = 7y - 21
\]

To isolate \( y \), we subtract \( 4y \) from both sides:

\[
15 = 3y - 21
\]

Then, we add 21 to both sides:

\[
36 = 3y
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

\[
y = 12

So, the number of yellow balls initially in the bag is \(\boxed{12}\).

To verify, we calculate the initial number of blue balls:

\[
b = \frac{4}{3} \times 12 = 16

After adding 5 blue balls and removing 3 yellow balls, the new number of blue balls is \( 16 + 5 = 21 \) and the new number of yellow balls is \( 12 - 3 = 9 \). The new ratio is:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)

Next, we calculate the dot product \(\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27
\]

Now, we find the magnitudes of \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\|\overrightarrow{BA}\| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

\[
\|\overrightarrow{BC}\| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

First, recall that if a triangle is inscribed in a circle and one of its sides is the diameter of the circle, then the angle opposite to that side is a right angle. This is a well-known property of a semicircle.

In this problem, since \(AB\) is the diameter, \(\angle C\) must be a right angle. Therefore, \(\angle C = 90^\circ\).

Next, we know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\). So, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in \(\triangle ABC\) as:
\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ

Substituting the known values of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle C\), we get:

"To solve for the length of \( BH \) in the given geometric configuration, we need to analyze the relationships between the sides and the angles in the shapes involved.

First, let's identify the given information:
- \( CDEG \) is a square with side length \( CD = 3 \).
- \( BEFH \) is a rectangle with \( BE = 5 \).

Since \( CDEG \) is a square, all its sides are equal, so \( DE = EC = CG = GD = 3 \).

Next, we need to determine the coordinates of the points in the coordinate plane. Let's place point \( A \) at the origin, \( A = (0, 0) \). Then:
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (6, 0) \)
- \( D = (9, 0) \)
- \( E = (9, 3) \)
- \( G = (6, 3) \)

Now, we need to find the coordinates of points \( F \) and \( H \). Since \( BEFH \) is a rectangle with \( BE = 5 \), the length of \( BF \) must be 5. Therefore, \( F \) is either \( (9, 8) \) or \( (9, -2) \). However, since \( F \) is above \( B \), we have \( F = (9, 8) \).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of \( H \). \( H \) is the intersection of the line \( AF \) and the line \( AG \). The line \( AF \) passes through points \( A = (0, 0) \) and \( F = (9, 8) \), so its equation is:
\[ y = \frac{8}{9}x \]

The line \( AG \) passes through points \( A = (0, 0) \) and \( G = (6, 3) \), so its equation is:
\[ y = \frac{1}{2}x \]

To find the coordinates of \( H \), we solve the system of equations:
\[ y = \frac{8}{9}x \]
\[ y = \frac{1}{2}x \]

Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[ \frac{8}{9}x = \frac{1}{2}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 18:
\[ 16x = 9x \]
\[ 7x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) back into either equation, we get:
\[ y = 0 \]

Therefore, the coordinates of \( H \) are \( (0, 0) \), which is the same as point \( A \). However, this result seems incorrect because it implies that \( H \) is at the same point as \( A \), which is not possible given the configuration of the rectangle \( BEFH \).

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the correct intersection of the lines \( AF \) and \( AG \) in the correct quadrant. The correct coordinates of \( H \) should be found by considering the correct intersection of the lines in the correct quadrant.

The correct intersection of the lines \( AF \) and \( AG \) in the correct quadrant is:
\[ H = \left( \frac{18}{7}, \frac{9}{7} \right) \]

The length of \( BH \) is the distance between \( B = (3, 0) \) and \( H = \left( \frac{18}{7}, \frac{9}{7} \right) \):
\[ BH = \sqrt{\left( \frac{18}{7} - 3 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{9}{7} - 0 \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{18}{7} - \frac{21}{7} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{9}{7} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( -\frac{3}{7} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{9}{7} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{49} + \frac{81}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{90}{49}} = \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{7} \]

Therefore, the length of \( BH \) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 100 is a multiple of 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   The numbers from 1 to 100 are the possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 100.

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   A favorable outcome is a number that is a multiple of 3. We need to find how many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 100. The smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 3, and the largest is 99. The multiples of 3 form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 3, the common difference \(d\) is 3, and the last term \(a_n\) is 99. The number of terms \(n\) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   Substituting the known values, we get:
   \[
   99 = 3 + (n-1) \cdot 3

   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   99 = 3 + 3(n-1)

   \[

   \[

   So, there are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 100.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability \(P\) of selecting a multiple of 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the given circle and the points of tangency. Let's start by identifying the key elements and their relationships.

1. **Identify the given elements:**

   - Points \( H \) and \( N \) are points of tangency of the line segment \( HN \) with the circle \( J \).
   - Point \( H \) is on the circle, and point \( N \) is also on the circle.
   - \( O \) is the center of the circle, and \( HN \) is a chord of the circle.

2. **Understand the tangency condition:**
   - Since \( HN \) is tangent to the circle at point \( N \), the radius \( ON \) is perpendicular to the tangent \( HN \). Therefore, \( \angle ONH = 90^\circ \).

3. **Identify the angle \( \angle J \):**
   - The angle \( \angle J \) is the central angle subtended by the arc \( HN \). The measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.

4. **Identify the angle \( \angle H \):**
   - The angle \( \angle H \) is the inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( HN \). The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

5. **Relate the angles \( \angle J \) and \( \angle H \):**
   - Since \( \angle H \) is the inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( HN \), and \( \angle J \) is the central angle subtended by the same arc \( HN \), we have:

For \( n = 10 \), the sum \( S \) is:

\[ S = \frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \]

\[ 55 \div 9 = 6 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

This means that 55 can be written as:

The remainder is the part left over after subtracting the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 55. In this case, the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 55 is \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \), and the remainder is:

- The total cost before the discount is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.
- Smith receives a 25% discount. To find the amount of the discount, we calculate \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost after the discount is \(80 - 20 = 60\) dollars.

"To find the remainder when \(997^{-1}\) is divided by 1000, we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[997x = 1000k + 1\]

for some integer \(k\). Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[997x - 1000k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 997 and 1000.

\[1000 = 1 \cdot 997 + 3\]
\[997 = 332 \cdot 3 + 1\]
\[3 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is 1, and since 1 is the gcd, 997 and 1000 are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express 1 as a combination of 997 and 1000.

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 3\]

Substitute the expression for 3 from the first equation:

\[3 = 1000 - 1 \cdot 997\]

So,

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot (1000 - 1 \cdot 997)\]
\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 1000 + 332 \cdot 997\]
\[1 = 997 + 332 \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]
\[1 = (1 + 332) \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by \(10000\) to shift the decimal point four places to the right:
\[10000x = 1331.133113311331\ldots\]

Now, we subtract the original equation \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\) from this new equation:
\[10000x - x = 1331.133113311331\ldots - 0.133113311331\ldots\]
\[9999x = 1331\]
\[x = \frac{1331}{9999}\]

Next, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{1331}{9999}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1331 and 9999. First, we factorize both numbers:
\[1331 = 11^3\]
\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101\]

The only common factor between 1331 and 9999 is 11. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by 11:

\[909 = 3^2 \times 101\]

Since 121 and 909 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \(\frac{121}{909}\) is in its simplest form.

First, we know that in Italy, 1200 liters ofジェラート cost 1,000,000 liters. The cost per liter in Italy is:
\[
\text{Cost per liter in Italy} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ liters}}{1200 \text{ liters}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1200} = \frac{1000}{1.2} = \frac{10000}{12} = \frac{5000}{6} = 833.33 \text{ dollars per liter}

Next, we need to consider the points within a distance of 1 unit from the perimeter of the nonagon. These points form a region that extends 1 unit outward from the nonagon. This region can be visualized as a ""thickened"" nonagon, where each side is extended by 1 unit on both sides, and the vertices are rounded out by a quarter circle of radius 1 unit.

The additional length contributed by the extensions of the sides is:

This inequality simplifies to

\[
a(2a+b) - 2a^2 + ab = 2a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + ab = 2ab.

So, the expression simplifies to \(2ab\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct prime numbers greater than 2, both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd primes. Therefore, \(2ab\) is an even number and is divisible by 2, \(a\), \(b\), and \(ab\).

The prime factorization of \(2ab\) is \(2 \times a \times b\). To find the number of divisors of \(2ab\), we use the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization. If a number \(n\) has a prime factorization of \(p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\), then the number of divisors of \(n\) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\).

"To determine the measure of angle \( A \) in the given configuration, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the regular pentagon and the star shape formed by extending its sides.

First, recall that the interior angle of a regular pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ.
\]
Thus, each interior angle of the pentagon \( FGHIJ \) is \( 108^\circ \).

Next, consider the star shape formed by extending the sides of the pentagon. The star shape consists of five isosceles triangles, each with a vertex angle at the center of the pentagon and base angles at the vertices of the pentagon. The vertex angle of each isosceles triangle is the same as the interior angle of the pentagon, which is \( 108^\circ \).

The base angles of each isosceles triangle are equal, and their sum with the vertex angle must be \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, each base angle is:
\[
\frac{180^\circ - 108^\circ}{2} = \frac{72^\circ}{2} = 36^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the angle \( A \) in the star shape. Angle \( A \) is formed by two of these base angles of the isosceles triangles, specifically the base angles at the vertices \( H \) and \( I \) of the pentagon. Therefore, angle \( A \) is:
\[
36^\circ + 36^\circ = 72^\circ.

"To determine the next term in the sequence \(0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, \ldots\), we need to understand the pattern of generation. The sequence starts with \(a_1 = 0\). The subsequent terms are generated as follows:
- \(a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\)
- \(a_3 = a_2 \times 1 = 1 \times 1 = 1\)

- \(a_{13} = a_{12} \times 13 = 8636 \times 13 = 112268\)

"To solve the expression \(\left(4\dfrac{5}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}\), we can start by simplifying the expression using the properties of exponents. Specifically, we can combine the two terms into a single term with a single exponent.

First, let's convert the mixed number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) into an improper fraction. The number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) can be written as:
\[4\dfrac{5}{8} = 4 + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{32}{8} + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{37}{8}.\]

Now, substitute \(\dfrac{37}{8}\) for \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) in the original expression:
\[\left(4\dfrac{5}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55} = \left(\dfrac{37}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}.\]

Next, we use the property of exponents that states \(a^m \cdot b^m = (a \cdot b)^m\). Applying this property, we get:
\[\left(\dfrac{37}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55} = \left(\dfrac{37}{8} \cdot \dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}.\]

Now, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[\dfrac{37}{8} \cdot \dfrac{8}{37} = \dfrac{37 \cdot 8}{8 \cdot 37} = \dfrac{296}{296} = 1.\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[\left(1\right)^{55}.\]

Since any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1, we have:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta.
\]
Thus, the expression inside the sine function becomes:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta + \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
Therefore, the original equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\), so the equation becomes:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start with the polynomial \( P(x) = 2x^3 - 2ax^2 + (a^2 - 81)x - c \). Since all the roots of the polynomial are positive integers, we can express \( P(x) \) as \( P(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) \), where \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) are the positive integer roots.

Expanding \( P(x) \), we get:

By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \( P(x) = 2x^3 - 2ax^2 + (a^2 - 81)x - c \), we obtain:

"To solve the problem, we need to consider all possible sets of side lengths \((a, b, c)\) that form a triangle with integer side lengths. The triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, for any set \((a, b, c)\) where \(a \leq b \leq c\), the following conditions must hold:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

Since \(a \leq b \leq c\), the third condition \(b + c > a\) is always true. Therefore, the only conditions we need to consider are:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)

Given that \(a \leq b \leq c\), the second condition \(a + c > b\) is also always true. Therefore, the only condition we need to consider is:
\[a + b > c\]

We will now sum the expression \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) over all such sets \((a, b, c)\). We will consider all possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a + b > c\), \(a \leq b \leq c\), and \(a + b + c\) is the perimeter of a triangle.

First, let's consider the case when \(a = 1\):
- If \(b = 1\), then \(c > 2\) (since \(1 + 1 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 3, 4, 5, \ldots.
- If \(b = 2\), then \(c > 3\) (since \(1 + 2 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 4, 5, 6, \ldots.
- If \(b = 3\), then \(c > 4\) (since \(1 + 3 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 5, 6, 7, \ldots.
- And so on.

Next, let's consider the case when \(a = 2\):
- If \(b = 2\), then \(c > 4\) (since \(2 + 2 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 5, 6, 7, \ldots.
- If \(b = 3\), then \(c > 5\) (since \(2 + 3 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 6, 7, 8, \ldots.
- If \(b = 4\), then \(c > 6\) (since \(2 + 4 > c\) is not possible for \(c \leq b\)). Therefore, \(c\) can be 7, 8, 9, \ldots.
- And so on.

We can see that the number of valid sets \((a, b, c)\) is infinite, but the sum of the expression \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) converges. To find the sum, we can use the fact that the sum of a geometric series is given by:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} \quad \text{for} \quad |x| < 1

where \(\mathbf{1}_{a+b > c}\) is the indicator function that is 1 if \(a + b > c\) and 0 otherwise.

We can simplify this sum by considering the sum over all possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and then subtracting the sum of the terms where \(a + b \leq c\).

The sum of the terms where \(a + b \leq c\) is:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}

We can rewrite this sum as:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c}
\]

The inner sum \(\sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c}\) is a geometric series with the first term \(\frac{1}{5^{a+b}}\) and common ratio \(\frac{1}{5}\), so it sums to:
\[
\sum_{c=a+b}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5^c} = \frac{\frac{1}{5^{a+b}}}{1 - \frac{1}{5}} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 5^{a+b}}

Therefore, the sum becomes:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{1}{4 \cdot 5^{a+b}} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^{a+b}} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{5^a} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(3 \cdot 5)^b}

\sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(15)^b} = \frac{\frac{1}{15^a}}{1 - \frac{1}{15}} = \frac{1}{14 \cdot 15^a}

Therefore, the sum becomes:

The sum \(\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2}{75}\right)^a\) is a geometric series with the first term \(\frac{2}{75}\) and common ratio \(\frac{2}{75}\), so it sums to:

First, we convert these times into fractions with a common denominator:

\[ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{15}{12} \]

The LCM of \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{15}{12} \) is the LCM of 16 and 15 divided by 12. Since 16 and 15 are coprime, their LCM is \( 16 \times 15 = 240 \). Therefore, the LCM of \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{15}{12} \) is \( \frac{240}{12} = 20 \).

Thus, the least common multiple of the time intervals is 20 minutes. To convert this into seconds, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Now, we find the magnitude of the cross product:

\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.
\]

Rearranging this inequality, we obtain

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) \geq 16.
\]

To check if this minimum value is achievable, we consider the equality condition of the AM-HM inequality, which occurs when \(a = b = c = d\). Let \(a = b = c = d = k\). Then,

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) = (k + k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) = 4k \cdot \frac{4}{k} = 16.

"To solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(2r - 7\):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7)
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
(4r - 3)(2r - 7) = 4r \cdot 2r + 4r \cdot (-7) + (-3) \cdot 2r + (-3) \cdot (-7) = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

To simplify, we move all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0
\]

We can multiply the entire equation by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0
\]

Next, we factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \cdot 28 = 56\) and add up to \(-15\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(-8\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r - 4 = 0
\]

Solving these equations, we get:

\[
r = \frac{7}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4
\]

However, we must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they do not make the denominator zero. The original equation is:

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3
\]

If \(r = \frac{7}{2}\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is:

\[
2 \left(\frac{7}{2}\right) - 7 = 7 - 7 = 0
\]

So, \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is not a valid solution. If \(r = 4\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is:

\[
2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1
\]

So, \(r = 4\) is a valid solution. Therefore, the only solution to the equation is:

"To determine how many integer coordinate points lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the region where the \(x\)-coordinates and \(y\)-coordinates of the points satisfy the inequalities:

\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4.
\]

This means that \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

First, let's count the number of possible values for \(x\). The integers from \(-4\) to \(4\) are:

There are \(7\) such integers.

To find the total number of integer coordinate points that lie strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To solve for \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \) given the recurrence relation \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \) for \( n \geq 5 \) and the initial conditions \( x_1 = 211 \), \( x_2 = 375 \), \( x_3 = 420 \), \( x_4 = 523 \), we first need to determine the periodicity of the sequence.

Let's compute the first few terms of the sequence:
\[
x_5 = x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267
\]
\[
x_6 = x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211
\]
\[
x_7 = x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375
\]
\[
x_8 = x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420
\]
\[
x_9 = x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523
\]
\[
x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -207
\]
\[
x_{11} = x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -207 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 271
\]
\[
x_{12} = x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 271 - (-207) + (-523) - (-420) = 375
\]

Notice that \( x_{12} = x_2 \). Let's compute a few more terms to check for periodicity:
\[
x_{13} = x_{12} - x_{11} + x_{10} - x_9 = 375 - 271 + (-207) - (-523) = 420
\]
\[
x_{14} = x_{13} - x_{12} + x_{11} - x_{10} = 420 - 375 + 271 - (-207) = 523
\]
\[
x_{15} = x_{14} - x_{13} + x_{12} - x_{11} = 523 - 420 + 375 - 271 = 211
\]
\[
x_{16} = x_{15} - x_{14} + x_{13} - x_{12} = 211 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -267
\]

We observe that \( x_{16} = -x_5 \). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, we can write:
\[
x_n = x_{n \mod 12}
\]

Now, we need to find \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \):
\[
531 \mod 12 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{531} = x_3 = 420
\]
\[
753 \mod 12 = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{753} = x_9 = 271
\]
\[
975 \mod 12 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{975} = x_3 = 420
\]

Thus,
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + 271 + 420 = 1111

"To solve the system of inequalities \(0 \ge 54p - 144\) and \(0 > 12 - 20p\), we will solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solution sets.

First, let's solve the inequality \(0 \ge 54p - 144\):
\[
0 \ge 54p - 144
\]
Add 144 to both sides:
\[
144 \ge 54p
\]
Divide both sides by 54:
\[
\frac{144}{54} \ge p
\]
Simplify the fraction \(\frac{144}{54}\):
\[
\frac{144 \div 18}{54 \div 18} = \frac{8}{3}
\]
So, the solution to the first inequality is:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(0 > 12 - 20p\):
\[
0 > 12 - 20p
\]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
-12 > -20p
\]
Divide both sides by -20 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[
\frac{-12}{-20} < p
\]
Simplify the fraction \(\frac{-12}{-20}\):
\[
\frac{12 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{3}{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive positive integers whose sum is a three-digit palindrome and is less than 220. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n+2 \). The sum of these integers is:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)
\]
We need this sum to be a three-digit palindrome and less than 220. Therefore, we have:
\[
3(n+1) < 220
\]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
n+1 < \frac{220}{3} \approx 73.33

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:
\[
n \leq 72

Next, we need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( 3(n+1) \) is a three-digit palindrome. The largest three-digit palindrome is 999. We set up the inequality:

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
n+1 \leq \frac{999}{3} = 333

\[

"To solve the equation \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \), we start by recognizing that it can be rewritten in a form that suggests a binomial expansion. Notice that:

\[ z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + i = (z + 1)^4 - 1. \]

Setting this equal to zero, we get:

\[ (z + 1)^4 - 1 = 0, \]
\[ (z + 1)^4 = 1. \]

The fourth roots of unity are \( 1, -1, i, -i \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + 1 = 1, \quad z + 1 = -1, \quad z + 1 = i, \quad z + 1 = -i. \]

Solving these equations for \( z \), we get:

\[ z = 0, \quad z = -2, \quad z = i - 1, \quad z = -i - 1. \]

These are the solutions to the equation. In the complex plane, these points are:

\[ 0, \quad -2, \quad -1 + i, \quad -1 - i. \]

These points form a convex quadrilateral. To find the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the Shoelace Theorem. The vertices in order are \( 0, -2, -1+i, -1-i \). We can represent these points as coordinates in the complex plane: \( (0,0), (-2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1) \).

Using the Shoelace Theorem, the area \( A \) is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 1) + (-2)(1 - (-1)) + (-1)(-1 - 0) + (-1)(0 - 0) \right|, \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + (-2)(2) + (-1)(-1) + 0 \right|, \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 4 + 1 + 0 \right|, \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3 \right|, \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3, \]
\[ A = \frac{3}{2}. \]

The area of the quadrilateral is \( \frac{3}{2} \). In the form \( p^{a/b} \), we have \( p = 3 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( b = 1 \). Therefore, \( a + b + p = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 \).

   \[
   x = \frac{\log \left( \frac{7}{3} \right)}{\log \left( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \right)}

To compare these values, we need to compare the denominators \( \log (1 + r) \), \( \log \left( 1 + \frac{r}{10} \right) \), \( \log (1 + 2r) \), \( \log (1 + \sqrt{r}) \), and \( \log \left( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \right) \).

Since \( 0 < r < 3 \), we have:

\[

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[

Combining these results, we have

Next, we calculate the total price of the stamps collected from each country:

- Total price for Peru: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) cents

From the division, we observe that the decimal representation is \(0.0027\overline{9}\). This means that after the first four digits (0.0027), the digit 9 repeats indefinitely.

To confirm this, we can express the decimal as a sum of a non-repeating part and a repeating part. Let \(x = 0.0027999999999999998\ldots\). Then, \(10000x = 27.999999999999998\ldots\). Subtracting the original \(x\) from this equation, we get:

\[
10000x - x = 27.999999999999998\ldots - 0.0027999999999999998\ldots
\]
\[
9999x = 27.9972
\]
\[
x = \frac{27.9972}{9999}
\]

Since \(27.9972\) is very close to \(28\) and \(9999\) is exactly \(10000 - 1\), we can approximate:

\[
x \approx \frac{28}{10000} = 0.0028
\]

However, the exact value is \(0.0027999999999999998\ldots\), which confirms that the repeating part is indeed \(9\).

Thus, the repeating cycle is \(9\), and the length of the repeating cycle is \(1\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} (a + b) h = 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of the legs. Let \(AC = c\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} c \cdot CD.
\]

Because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}.
\]

Let \(AB = k \cdot a\) and \(CD = k \cdot b\). The area of \(\triangle ABD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot k \cdot a \cdot h.
\]

The area of \(\triangle BCD\) is:
\[
[\triangle BCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h.
\]

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABD] + [\triangle BCD] = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot a \cdot h + \frac{1}{2} b \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} h (k \cdot a + b).
\]

Since \(k = \frac{b}{a}\), we substitute \(k\) into the equation:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} h \left( \frac{b}{a} \cdot a + b \right) = \frac{1}{2} h (b + b) = h \cdot b.
\]

We know that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
h \cdot b = 42.
\]

Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} c \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} c \cdot b.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + h^2}\). However, we can use the fact that \(c = \frac{a}{b} \cdot b = a\). Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{42}{h} \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\), we start by simplifying the expression. First, we expand the numerator:

\[
(x + 5)(x + 2) = x^2 + 7x + 10
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1}
\]

Next, we perform polynomial long division to simplify this fraction. We divide \(x^2 + 7x + 10\) by \(x + 1\):

1. Divide the leading term \(x^2\) by \(x\) to get \(x\).
2. Multiply \(x\) by \(x + 1\) to get \(x^2 + x\).
3. Subtract \(x^2 + x\) from \(x^2 + 7x + 10\) to get \(6x + 10\).
4. Divide the leading term \(6x\) by \(x\) to get \(6\).
5. Multiply \(6\) by \(x + 1\) to get \(6x + 6\).
6. Subtract \(6x + 6\) from \(6x + 10\) to get \(4\).

So, the result of the division is:

\[
\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1} = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}
\]

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the function \(f(x) = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\). To do this, we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[
1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 0 \implies \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 1 \implies (x + 1)^2 = 4 \implies x + 1 = 2 \implies x = 1
\]

Since \(x = 1\) is in the domain \(x > 0\), we substitute \(x = 1\) back into the function \(f(x)\):

\[
f(1) = 1 + 6 + \frac{4}{1 + 1} = 1 + 6 + 2 = 9
\]

To confirm that this is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of \(f(x)\) is:

\[
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}\right) = \frac{8}{(x + 1)^3}
\]

Since \(f''(x) > 0\) for \(x > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) has a local minimum at \(x = 1\).

Therefore, the minimum value of \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**

3. **Isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**

"To solve the problem, we start with the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) and the condition that if \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root. Let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation by \(c\) and \(d\). According to the problem, if \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root. Therefore, \(d\) must be either \(c\) or \(c^2 - 2\).

### Case 1: \(d = c\)
If \(d = c\), then \(c\) is a double root. The quadratic equation can be written as:
\[
(x - c)^2 = 0
\]
Expanding this, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2cx + c^2 = 0
\]
By comparing coefficients with the original quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\), we find:
\[
a = -2c \quad \text{and} \quad b = c^2
\]
Thus, the quadratic equation is:
\[
x^2 - 2cx + c^2 = 0
\]
The roots are both \(c\), and the condition \(d = c^2 - 2\) is satisfied if \(c = c^2 - 2\). Solving this equation:
\[
c^2 - c - 2 = 0
\]
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
\[
(c - 2)(c + 1) = 0
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
c = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad c = -1
\]
For \(c = 2\), the quadratic equation is:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
\]
For \(c = -1\), the quadratic equation is:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
\]
Thus, the quadratic equations in this case are:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
\]

### Case 2: \(d = c^2 - 2\)
If \(d = c^2 - 2\), then \(c\) and \(c^2 - 2\) are the roots. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) is \(-a\) and the product of the roots is \(b\). Therefore, we have:
\[
c + (c^2 - 2) = -a \quad \text{and} \quad c(c^2 - 2) = b
\]
Simplifying the sum of the roots:
\[
c^2 + c - 2 = -a \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = -c^2 - c + 2
\]
Simplifying the product of the roots:
\[
c^3 - 2c = b
\]
Thus, the quadratic equation is:
\[
x^2 + (-c^2 - c + 2)x + (c^3 - 2c) = 0
\]
The roots are \(c\) and \(c^2 - 2\), and the condition \(d = c^2 - 2\) is satisfied. However, we need to check if there are any specific values of \(c\) that satisfy the original condition. Let's substitute \(c = 2\) and \(c = -1\) again:
- For \(c = 2\):
  \[
  a = -2^2 - 2 + 2 = -4 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 2^3 - 2 \cdot 2 = 8 - 4 = 4
  \]
  The quadratic equation is:
  \[
  x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
  \]
  This is the same as the quadratic equation found in Case 1.
- For \(c = -1\):
  \[
  a = -(-1)^2 - (-1) + 2 = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad b = (-1)^3 - 2 \cdot (-1) = -1 + 2 = 1
  \]
  The quadratic equation is:
  \[
  x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
  \]
  This is the same as the quadratic equation found in Case 1.

Therefore, the only distinct quadratic equations that satisfy the given condition are:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0

"To determine the range of the function \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the logarithm and then apply the properties of the logarithmic function.

1. **Identify the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\):**
   - The sine function, \(\sin x\), is positive in the interval \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\).
   - The minimum value of \(\sin x\) in this interval is \(\sin 0^\circ = 0\) ( approached as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\)), and the maximum value is \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\).
   - Therefore, the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\) is \(0 < \sin x \leq 1\).

2. **Determine the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\):**
   - Since the square root function is increasing and defined for positive inputs, the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\) will be \(\sqrt{0} < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq \sqrt{1}\), which simplifies to \(0 < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq 1\).

3. **Find the range of \(y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})\):**
   - The logarithm function \(\log_2 t\) is defined for \(t > 0\) and is increasing. As \(t\) approaches 0 from the right, \(\log_2 t\) approaches \(-\infty\), and \(\log_2 1 = 0\).
   - Therefore, the range of \(y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})\) is \((-\infty, 0]\).

Thus, the value range of the function \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \) is \(\boxed{(-\infty, 0]}\).","[Interval(-oo, 0), '(-\\infty, 0]']","(-\infty, 0]","[0, '0']",True
"To find the surface area of one of the two parts of the regular tetrahedron \(ABCD\) divided by the plane parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the tetrahedron and the plane.

First, we note that a regular tetrahedron with edge length \(a = 2\) has a surface area given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 4 \times \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = 4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2^2 = 4\sqrt{3}
\]

The plane that is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and passes through the midpoint of the edge \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) will divide the tetrahedron into two congruent parts. Each part will have a surface area consisting of:
1. One equilateral triangle (the cross-section of the plane with the tetrahedron).
2. Three isosceles triangles (the parts of the original tetrahedron's faces that are not part of the cross-section).

The cross-section is an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\). Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel and the plane is parallel to them, the cross-section is an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the edge length of the tetrahedron, which is 2.

The area of this equilateral triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of the cross-section} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2^2 = \sqrt{3}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the three isosceles triangles. Each of these triangles has a base of 2 (the edge length of the tetrahedron) and a height equal to the height of the tetrahedron minus the height of the smaller tetrahedron formed by the plane and the vertex \(D\). The height of the original tetrahedron is:
\[
h = \sqrt{2^2 - \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

The height of the smaller tetrahedron is half of the height of the original tetrahedron:
\[
h_{\text{small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

The height of each isosceles triangle is:
\[
h_{\text{isosceles}} = h - h_{\text{small}} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

The area of one isosceles triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of one isosceles triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

Since there are three such isosceles triangles, the total area of the three isosceles triangles is:
\[
\text{Total area of the three isosceles triangles} = 3 \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \sqrt{6}
\]

Finally, the surface area of one of the two parts of the tetrahedron is the sum of the area of the cross-section and the total area of the three isosceles triangles:
\[

First, the circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[ C = 2 \pi r \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Here, the radius \( r \) is 9 inches. So, the circumference is:
\[ C = 2 \pi \times 9 = 18 \pi \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the wheel makes 2 rotations every 3 seconds. Therefore, the number of rotations per second is:

Since each rotation covers a distance equal to the circumference of the wheel, the distance traveled per second is:

### Step 2: Reflect the point \((2,0)\) off the line \(y=2\)
The line \(y=2\) is a horizontal line. When a point \((x,y)\) is reflected off a horizontal line \(y=b\), the image of the point is \((x,2b-y)\). Here, \(b=2\), so the image of the point \((2,0)\) is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(a\), \(b\), and \(2009\) form a geometric sequence. This means that the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{2009}{b}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
b^2 = 2009a
\]

This equation tells us that \(2009a\) must be a perfect square. First, we factorize \(2009\):

\[
2009 = 7^2 \times 41
\]

For \(2009a\) to be a perfect square, \(a\) must include the factor \(41\) to make the product a perfect square. Therefore, we can write \(a\) as:

\[
a = 41k^2
\]

for some integer \(k\). Substituting \(a = 41k^2\) into the equation \(b^2 = 2009a\) gives:

\[
b^2 = 2009 \times 41k^2 = 82369k^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
b = 287k
\]

We are given that \(a < b < 2009\). Substituting the expressions for \(a\) and \(b\) into this inequality, we get:

\[
41k^2 < 287k < 2009
\]

First, we solve the inequality \(41k^2 < 287k\):

\[
41k < 287 \implies k < \frac{287}{41} \implies k < 7
\]

Since \(k\) is a positive integer, the possible values for \(k\) are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\). Next, we solve the inequality \(287k < 2009\):

\[
k < \frac{2009}{287} \implies k < 7
\]

This inequality is the same as the previous one, so the possible values for \(k\) remain \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\). To find the largest possible value for \(k\) that satisfies both inequalities, we choose the largest value in the set, which is \(6\). Substituting \(k = 6\) into the expression for \(a\), we get:

a = 41 \times 6^2 = 41 \times 36 = 1476

"To solve the problem, we start by factoring the quadratic expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) into the form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). We need to find integers \(A\) and \(B\) such that the expanded form matches the original quadratic expression.

First, we expand \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\):
\[
(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24 = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24.
\]
We need this to be equal to \(10x^2 - x - 24\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:
\[
AB = 10,
\]
\[
3A - 8B = -1.
\]

We will solve this system step by step. First, we list the possible pairs \((A, B)\) that satisfy \(AB = 10\):
\[
(1, 10), (-1, -10), (2, 5), (-2, -5), (10, 1), (-10, -1), (5, 2), (-5, -2).
\]

Next, we substitute these pairs into the equation \(3A - 8B = -1\) and check which pair satisfies it.

1. For \((A, B) = (1, 10)\):
\[
3(1) - 8(10) = 3 - 80 = -77 \quad \text{(not equal to -1)}.

2. For \((A, B) = (-1, -10)\):
\[
3(-1) - 8(-10) = -3 + 80 = 77 \quad \text{(not equal to -1)}.

3. For \((A, B) = (2, 5)\):
\[

\]

4. For \((A, B) = (-2, -5)\):
\[
3(-2) - 8(-5) = -6 + 40 = 34 \quad \text{(not equal to -1)}.

5. For \((A, B) = (10, 1)\):
\[
3(10) - 8(1) = 30 - 8 = 22 \quad \text{(not equal to -1)}.

6. For \((A, B) = (-10, -1)\):
\[
3(-10) - 8(-1) = -30 + 8 = -22 \quad \text{(not equal to -1)}.

\[

The only pair that satisfies both equations is \((A, B) = (5, 2)\). Now, we need to find the value of \(AB + B\):

First, let's rewrite the polynomial \( p(x) \):
\[ p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}. \]

Notice that each term in the sum is a quadratic polynomial in \( x \). Therefore, the sum of these three quadratic polynomials is also a quadratic polynomial. To confirm this, we can check the value of \( p(x) \) at specific points.

Let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = a \):
\[ p(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. \]

\[ p(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = c \):
\[ p(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. \]

We see that \( p(a) = 1 \), \( p(b) = 1 \), and \( p(c) = 1 \). Since \( p(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial and it takes the value 1 at three distinct points \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), it must be the constant polynomial 1. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \) is 0.

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{4+6a}{5} - \frac{1+3a}{4}\), we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 5 and 4, and their least common multiple is 20. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 20.

First, we rewrite \(\frac{4+6a}{5}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[
\frac{4+6a}{5} = \frac{(4+6a) \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} = \frac{16 + 24a}{20}

Next, we rewrite \(\frac{1+3a}{4}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[

"To solve the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \), we first isolate the absolute value expression. Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ |x-4| = 12 \]

The absolute value equation \( |x-4| = 12 \) means that \( x-4 \) can be either 12 or -12. Therefore, we can write two separate equations:

1. \( x-4 = 12 \)
2. \( x-4 = -12 \)

We solve each equation separately.

For the first equation:

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

"To find \(\cos \angle RPS\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\). Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are supplementary angles (they add up to \(180^\circ\)), we can use the identity for the cosine of a supplementary angle, which states that \(\cos(180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta\). Therefore, \(\cos \angle RPS = -\cos \angle RPQ\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPQ\). We use the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine, which states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\). Substituting \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\) into the identity, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1

\[
\frac{49}{625} + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1

\[

\[

\[

Taking the positive square root (since \(\angle RPQ\) is an acute angle in a right triangle), we get:

"To determine the length of the corridor, we first need to find the speed of the robot. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer, we can convert the distance to meters:

\[ 1 \text{ kilometer} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

The speed of the robot is the distance traveled divided by the time taken:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{2.5 \text{ hours}} \]

To simplify this, we can convert 2.5 hours to a fraction:

\[ 2.5 = \frac{5}{2} \]

So the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{\frac{5}{2} \text{ hours}} = 1000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 400 \text{ meters per hour} \]

Now that we know the speed of the robot, we can find the length of the corridor. The robot travels at a speed of 400 meters per hour and takes 90 seconds to move through the corridor. First, we convert 90 seconds to hours:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are randomly and independently selected on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) ways to assign the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) to the vertices of a quadrilateral. However, since the order in which we choose the points does not matter, we only need to consider the distinct quadrilaterals, which is given by the number of ways to choose 4 points out of 4, which is 1.

2. **Determine the number of ways the line segments intersect:**
   For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

   There are 2 such arrangements out of the 24 possible permutations of the points. Therefore, the number of ways the line segments intersect is 2.

3. **Calculate the probability:**

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi

The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

The shaded region consists of the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle and the area of the sector of the larger circle that is not part of the shaded region. The area of the smaller circle is:

So, the area of the sector of the larger circle that is part of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi

The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2

where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius of the circle. For the larger circle, the radius \(r = 2\), so:

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical bucket. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For one cylindrical bucket, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). This means that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

First, we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Since \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
Similarly,
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

\[ R(x) = ax + b. \]
Thus, we have:
\[ P(x) = (x-1)(x-4)Q(x) + ax + b. \]
We are also given that when \( P(x) \) is divided by \( (x-2)(x-3) \), the remainder is \( 2R(x) \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ P(x) = (x-2)(x-3)S(x) + 2ax + 2b, \]
for some polynomial \( S(x) \). Since \( P(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 3, we can use the given condition \( P(0) = 5 \) to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). First, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the first expression for \( P(x) \):
\[ P(0) = (0-1)(0-4)Q(0) + a \cdot 0 + b = 4Q(0) + b. \]
Given that \( P(0) = 5 \), we have:

\[ P(3) = (3-2)(3-3)S(3) + 2a \cdot 3 + 2b = 6a + 2b. \]
We also substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \) into the first expression for \( P(x) \):
\[ P(1) = (1-1)(1-4)Q(1) + a \cdot 1 + b = a + b, \]
\[ P(4) = (4-1)(4-4)Q(4) + a \cdot 4 + b = 4a + b. \]
Since \( P(1) = P(4) \) and \( P(2) = P(3) \), we have:
\[ a + b = 4a + b \implies a = 0, \]
\[ 4a + 2b = 6a + 2b \implies 4a = 6a \implies a = 0. \]
Thus, \( a = 0 \). Substituting \( a = 0 \) into equation (1), we get:
\[ b = 5. \]
Therefore, the remainder \( R(x) \) is:
\[ R(x) = 5. \]
So, we have:
\[ P(x) = (x-1)(x-4)Q(x) + 5. \]
To find \( P(5) \), we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the expression for \( P(x) \):
\[ P(5) = (5-1)(5-4)Q(5) + 5 = 4Q(5) + 5. \]
Since \( Q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 1, we can write \( Q(x) = cx + d \). However, we do not need the exact form of \( Q(x) \) to find \( P(5) \). The term \( 4Q(5) \) is a constant, and it does not affect the remainder when \( P(x) \) is divided by \( (x-1)(x-4) \). Therefore, the value of \( P(5) \) is:
\[ P(5) = 5. \]
Thus, the answer is:

"To determine the number of distinct values in the range of the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for \( x \in [0, \infty) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the floor function as \( x \) varies.

First, consider the expression \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \). For \( x = 0 \), we have:
\[
\left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^0 = 1.
\]
For \( x > 0 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is a negative number because the exponent is positive and the base is negative. As \( x \) increases, the magnitude of \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) decreases, approaching 0 but never reaching it. Therefore, for \( x > 0 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) takes on all values in the interval \( (-1, 0) \).

Now, we need to determine the values of the floor function \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for these intervals. For \( x = 0 \), we have:
\[
\left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^0 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1.
\]
For \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is a negative number between -1 and 0, so:
\[
\left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \text{negative number between -1 and 0} \right\rfloor = -1.
\]
For \( x \geq 1 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is a negative number between -1 and 0, and as \( x \) increases, the magnitude decreases, approaching 0. Therefore, for \( x \geq 1 \), \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor = -1 \).

Combining these results, we see that the function \( f(x) \) takes on only two distinct values: 1 and -1. Therefore, the number of distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) is:

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member committee from a group of 14 members (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats) with the condition that the committee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from 14 members:**
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member committee that consists entirely of Republicans:**

"To simplify the given expression \(\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}+\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}+\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{5}}}\), we will break it down step by step.

First, simplify each term in the numerator:
1. Simplify \(\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{16 \cdot 5}} = \dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5\sqrt{5}}{20} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.
   \]
2. Simplify \(\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{845} = \sqrt{169 \cdot 5} = 13\sqrt{5},
   \]
   so
   \[
   \dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9} = \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9}.
   \]
3. Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
   \]

Now substitute these simplified terms back into the numerator:
\[
\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} + \dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9} + \sqrt{45} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\sqrt{5}.
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Convert each term to have this common denominator:
\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} = \dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} = \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
3\sqrt{5} = \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{(9 + 52 + 108)\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

So the expression inside the square root becomes:
\[
\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169}{36}.
\]

Now take the square root of the simplified fraction:
\[
\sqrt{\dfrac{169}{36}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{169}}{\sqrt{36}} = \dfrac{13}{6}.

Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \((x + y)(y + z)\) given that \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\) and \(x, y, z\) are positive real numbers, we start by using the method of Lagrange multipliers or by making a strategic substitution. Here, we will use a substitution to simplify the problem.

First, let's assume \(x = a\), \(y = b\), and \(z = c\) such that \(abc(a + b + c) = 1\). We need to minimize \((a + b)(b + c)\).

To simplify, let's consider the case when \(x = y = z\). If \(x = y = z\), then the condition \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\) becomes \(x^3 \cdot 3x = 1\), which simplifies to \(3x^4 = 1\). Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\).

Now, we substitute \(x = y = z = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\) into the expression \((x + y)(y + z)\):
\[
(x + y)(y + z) = \left(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4} + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\right)\left(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4} + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\right) = 2\left(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\right) \cdot 2\left(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/4}\right) = 4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1/2} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

To confirm that this is indeed the minimum value, we can use the AM-GM inequality or other optimization techniques, but the symmetry and the fact that the function is convex in this context suggest that the minimum occurs at the symmetric point \(x = y = z\).

Therefore, the minimum value of \((x + y)(y + z)\) is \(\boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}}\).","[(4*sqrt(3))/3, '\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) in the continued fraction representation of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \), we start with the equation:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

First, we determine the integer part \( a \) of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \). Since \( 1^3 = 1 \) and \( 2^3 = 8 \), it follows that \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \). Therefore, \( a = 1 \). This gives us:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

Next, we isolate the fractional part by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} - 1 = \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find \( b \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \) (since \( (\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3 = (\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)(\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1) \)):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{2 - 1} = \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 = b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}
\]

Since \( b \) is the integer part of \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \), we need to find the value of \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \). We know that:

\[
1^3 = 1, \quad 2^3 = 8, \quad 3^3 = 27
\]

Therefore, \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \) and \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{4} < 2 \). Adding these inequalities, we get:

\[
2 < \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4} < 4
\]

Adding 1 to each part of the inequality, we obtain:

\[
3 < \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4} + 1 < 5
\]

Since \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \) is between 3 and 5, the integer part \( b \) is 3. Therefore, the value of \( b \) is:

"To find the value of the product \(abc\) given the equations \(a + b = 8\), \(b + c = -3\), and \(a + c = -5\), we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) step by step.

First, let's add all three equations together:
\[
(a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2a + 2b + 2c = 0
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 0
\]

Now we can use this equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's start by finding \(c\):
\[
c = -a - b
\]

Next, substitute \(c = -a - b\) into the equation \(b + c = -3\):
\[
b + (-a - b) = -3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-a = -3
\]
So, we have:
\[
a = 3
\]

Now substitute \(a = 3\) into the equation \(a + b = 8\):
\[
3 + b = 8
\]
So, we have:
\[
b = 5
\]

Finally, substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 5\) into the equation \(c = -a - b\):
\[
c = -3 - 5
\]
So, we have:
\[
c = -8

\[
3 \cdot 5 = 15

"To find the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we first need to understand the pattern in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \(F_1 = 1\), \(F_2 = 1\), and \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\) for \(n \geq 3\).

Let's compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_3 &\equiv F_2 + F_1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}, \\
F_4 &\equiv F_3 + F_2 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \\
F_5 &\equiv F_4 + F_3 \equiv 3 + 2 \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_6 &\equiv F_5 + F_4 \equiv 1 + 3 \equiv 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \\
F_7 &\equiv F_6 + F_5 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_8 &\equiv F_7 + F_6 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}.
\end{aligned}
\]

We observe that \(F_7 \equiv F_1 \pmod{4}\) and \(F_8 \equiv F_2 \pmod{4}\). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6. To confirm, let's compute a few more terms:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_9 &\equiv F_8 + F_7 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{10} &\equiv F_9 + F_8 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{11} &\equiv F_{10} + F_9 \equiv 3 + 2 \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{12} &\equiv F_{11} + F_{10} \equiv 1 + 3 \equiv 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
\end{aligned}
\]

 indeed, \(F_9 \equiv F_3 \pmod{4}\), \(F_{10} \equiv F_4 \pmod{4}\), \(F_{11} \equiv F_5 \pmod{4}\), and \(F_{12} \equiv F_6 \pmod{4}\). Therefore, the sequence is periodic with a period of 6.

To find the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to determine the position of 100 within the period. We do this by computing \(100 \mod 6\):

\[
100 \div 6 = 16 \text{ remainder } 4.
\]

So, \(100 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\). This means that \(F_{100} \equiv F_4 \pmod{4}\). From our earlier computation, we know that \(F_4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\).

Therefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To convert the decimal number \(999_{10}\) to its base-6 (hexadecimal) representation, we need to repeatedly divide the number by 6 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will form the digits of the base-6 number, read from bottom to top.

Here are the steps:

1. Divide 999 by 6:
   \[
   999 \div 6 = 166 \text{ remainder } 3
   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 3.

2. Divide 166 by 6:
   \[
   166 \div 6 = 27 \text{ remainder } 4

   So, the next digit is 4.

3. Divide 27 by 6:
   \[

4. Divide 4 by 6:

Since the quotient is now 0, we stop the division process. Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-6 number \(4343_6\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the reflected parabola and then find the sum of the coefficients of the new equation in terms of \( k \).

1. **Identify the vertex of the original parabola:**
   The vertex of the parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( \left( -\frac{b}{2a}, c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \right) \). Since the vertex is \( (h, k) \), we have:
   \[
   h = -\frac{b}{2a} \quad \text{and} \quad k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a}
   \]

2. **Equation of the reflected parabola:**
   When a parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is reflected over the line \( y = k \), the new equation becomes \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \). Substituting \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \), we get:
   \[
   y = a\left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 + k
   \]
   Expanding this, we have:
   \[
   y = a\left( x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} \right) + k = ax^2 + bx + \frac{b^2}{4a} + k
   \]
   Therefore, the coefficients \( d, e, \) and \( f \) of the new parabola \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \) are:
   \[
   d = a, \quad e = b, \quad f = \frac{b^2}{4a} + k
   \]

3. **Sum of the coefficients:**
   The sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f \) is:
   \[
   a + b + c + a + b + \frac{b^2}{4a} + k = 2a + 2b + c + \frac{b^2}{4a} + k
   \]
   Using the vertex equation \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \), we substitute \( c = k + \frac{b^2}{4a} \) into the sum:
   \[
   2a + 2b + \left( k + \frac{b^2}{4a} \right) + \frac{b^2}{4a} + k = 2a + 2b + 2k + \frac{b^2}{2a}

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2a + 2b + 2k + \frac{b^2}{2a}

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\), we can use the properties of the dot product and the given angles. Let's denote the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) by \(\theta\).

First, we know the following:
1. The angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\).
2. The angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\).

We can use the dot product formula \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\| \cos \phi\), where \(\phi\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express the dot products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]
\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos 84^\circ
\]
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

We can also express \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\) in terms of \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\), we get:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

We can divide both sides by \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in the triangle formed by \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]

We can substitute \(\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2\) from the Law of Cosines into the equation:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = \sqrt{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ} \cos \theta
\]

To find \(\cos \theta\), we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). The angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\). Therefore, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 29^\circ - 84^\circ = 67^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{67^\circ}\).","[67, '67^\\circ']",55^\circ,"[55, '55']",False
"To find the smallest number that satisfies the given condition, let's denote the number by \( x \). According to the problem, the expression ""その数の inverse数の2倍から1を引いた値"" can be written mathematically as:

\[
\frac{2}{x} - 1
\]

We need to find the smallest \( x \) such that this expression is equal to the number itself, i.e.,

\[
\frac{2}{x} - 1 = x
\]

To solve this equation, we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by \( x \):

\[
2 - x = x^2
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + x - 2 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-2\) and add up to \(1\). These numbers are \(2\) and \(-1\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[
(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 = 0
\]
\[
x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1

"To determine which integer \( x \) satisfies the inequality \(\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7} < \frac{1}{3}\), we will solve the inequality step by step.

First, let's solve the left part of the inequality:
\[
\frac{1}{4} < \frac{x}{7}
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7):
\[
7 < 4x
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[
\frac{7}{4} < x
\]
\[
1.75 < x
\]
Since \( x \) is an integer, we have:
\[
x > 1.75 \implies x \geq 2
\]

Now, let's solve the right part of the inequality:
\[
\frac{x}{7} < \frac{1}{3}
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides by 21 (the least common multiple of 7 and 3):
\[
3x < 7
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[
x < \frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
x < 2.3333
\]
Since \( x \) is an integer, we have:
\[
x \leq 2
\]

Combining both parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
2 \leq x \leq 2

This means that the only integer \( x \) that satisfies the inequality is:

"To determine the number of different 4-digit palindrome numbers that can be formed using two distinct letters from A to Z and two distinct digits from 0 to 9, we need to consider the structure of a 4-digit palindrome. A 4-digit palindrome has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. The letter part of the palindrome is not relevant to the problem since we are only focusing on the digit part.

Here are the steps to find the number of such palindromes:

1. **Choose the digit \( a \)**: There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9) to choose from for the first digit \( a \).
2. **Choose the digit \( b \)**: Since the digits must be distinct, there are 9 remaining choices for the digit \( b \) after choosing \( a \).

The total number of different 4-digit palindromes is the product of the number of choices for \( a \) and the number of choices for \( b \):

"To determine the value of \(a\) that makes the function \(f(n)\) continuous, we need to ensure that the left-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\) is equal to the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\), and both are equal to \(f(a)\).

The function \(f(n)\) is defined as:
\[ f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n+3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n-12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^-} f(n) = 4a + 3. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^+} f(n) = 7a - 12. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(n = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12. \]

Now, we solve this equation for \(a\):
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12, \]
\[ 3 + 12 = 7a - 4a, \]
\[ 15 = 3a, \]
\[ a = 5. \]

To verify, we substitute \(a = 5\) back into the function and check the limits:
\[ \lim_{n \to 5^-} f(n) = 4(5) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23, \]
\[ \lim_{n \to 5^+} f(n) = 7(5) - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23. \]

"To find \( t(g(16)) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine the value of \( g(16) \).
2. Then, use the value obtained from step 1 to find \( t \) of that value.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = \sqrt{x} \]
So, we substitute \( x = 16 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

Now that we have \( g(16) = 4 \), we move to step 2. We need to find \( t(4) \). The function \( t(x) \) is given by:
\[ t(x) = 3 - g(x) \]
Since \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
So, we substitute \( g(4) = 2 \) into the function \( t(x) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

1. Distribute the constants 4 and -6 through their respective parentheses.
2. Combine like terms.

Let's start with the first step:

Distribute the 4 through the first set of parentheses:
\[4(3r^3 + 5r - 6) = 4 \cdot 3r^3 + 4 \cdot 5r + 4 \cdot (-6) = 12r^3 + 20r - 24.\]

Distribute the -6 through the second set of parentheses:

Now, combine the results from the two distributions:
\[12r^3 + 20r - 24 - 12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r.\]

Next, combine the like terms. The \(r^3\) terms cancel each other out:

"To calculate \(\dbinom{31}{28}\), we can use the property of binomial coefficients that \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}\). This property tells us that the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from \(n\) elements is the same as the number of ways to choose \(n-k\) elements from \(n\) elements. Therefore, we can rewrite \(\dbinom{31}{28}\) as \(\dbinom{31}{3}\).

Now, we need to calculate \(\dbinom{31}{3}\). The binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\) is given by the formula:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

For \(\dbinom{31}{3}\), we substitute \(n = 31\) and \(k = 3\):

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31!}{3!(31-3)!} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot 28!}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the \(28!\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29 \times 28!}{3! \times 28!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{3!}

"To find the last digit of \(18^6\), we only need to consider the last digit of the base number, which is 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the last digit of \(8^6\).

Let's examine the pattern in the last digits of the powers of 8:
\[
8^1 = 8 \quad \text{(last digit is 8)}
\]
\[
8^2 = 64 \quad \text{(last digit is 4)}
\]
\[
8^3 = 512 \quad \text{(last digit is 2)}
\]
\[
8^4 = 4096 \quad \text{(last digit is 6)}
\]
\[
8^5 = 32768 \quad \text{(last digit is 8)}
\]
\[
8^6 = 262144 \quad \text{(last digit is 4)}
\]

From the above, we can see that the last digits repeat every 4 numbers: 8, 4, 2, 6. To find the last digit of \(8^6\), we need to determine the position of 6 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 6 is divided by 4:
\[
6 \div 4 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2
\]
The remainder is 2, so \(8^6\) has the same last digit as \(8^2\). From our pattern, we know that the last digit of \(8^2\) is 4.

Therefore, the last digit of \(18^6\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(16x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle. We know that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \). Point \( D \) lies on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then, \( BC = 2x \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \), we get:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + x^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we also have \( AC^2 = 121 + x^2 \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle DBC + \angle DCB + \angle BDC = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC + \angle DCB + 3\theta = 180^\circ.
\]
Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), we have \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} + \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} + 3\theta = 180^\circ \implies 180^\circ - \theta + 3\theta = 180^\circ \implies 2\theta = 0 \implies \theta = 30^\circ.
\]
Thus, \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

Now, we can find \( x \) using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \), \( \angle DBC = 30^\circ \), and \( \angle DCB = 60^\circ \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \) and \( BD = x \) (since \( \angle DBC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle DCB = 60^\circ \)).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \), we get:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 \implies (2x)^2 = x^2 + DC^2 \implies 4x^2 = x^2 + DC^2 \implies DC^2 = 3x^2 \implies DC = x\sqrt{3}.
\]

Now, we can find \( x \) using the fact that \( \triangle ABM \) is a right triangle:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \), \( \angle ABC = 75^\circ \), and \( \angle ACB = 75^\circ \), we have:
\[
\sin 30^\circ = \frac{AM}{AB} \implies \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{AB} \implies AB = 22.
\]
Substituting \( AB = 22 \) into the equation \( AB^2 = 121 + x^2 \), we get:
\[
22^2 = 121 + x^2 \implies 484 = 121 + x^2 \implies x^2 = 363 \implies x = \sqrt{363} = 11\sqrt{3}.
\]
Therefore, \( BC = 2x = 22\sqrt{3} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 22 + 22 + 22\sqrt{3} = 44 + 22\sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 6 distinct books such that the two math books are adjacent, we can treat the two math books as a single ""block"" or ""super book"". This reduces the problem to arranging 5 ""books"" (the math block and the other 4 individual books) in a line.

The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct ""books"" is given by the factorial of 5, which is \(5!\). Therefore, we have:

"To find the central value of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}\), we start by introducing new variables to simplify the expression. Let \(x = a + b\) and \(y = c\). Then the expression becomes

\[
\frac{(x + y)[x^2 + (x + 4y)^2]}{ab}.
\]

Since \(a + b = x\), we can express \(ab\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\) using the AM-GM inequality, but it is more straightforward to use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry to find the critical points. Let's assume \(a = b\) for simplicity and symmetry. Then \(x = 2a\) and the expression becomes

\[
\frac{(2a + y)[(2a)^2 + (2a + 4y)^2]}{a^2}.
\]

Simplifying inside the brackets, we get

\[
(2a)^2 = 4a^2 \quad \text{and} \quad (2a + 4y)^2 = 4a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2.
\]

So the expression becomes

\[
\frac{(2a + y)(4a^2 + 4a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2)}{a^2} = \frac{(2a + y)(8a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2)}{a^2}.
\]

Expanding the numerator, we get

\[
(2a + y)(8a^2 + 16ay + 16y^2) = 16a^3 + 32a^2y + 32ay^2 + 8a^2y + 16ay^2 + 16y^3 = 16a^3 + 40a^2y + 48ay^2 + 16y^3.
\]

So the expression becomes

\[
\frac{16a^3 + 40a^2y + 48ay^2 + 16y^3}{a^2} = 16a + 40y + 48\frac{y}{a} + 16\frac{y^3}{a^2}.
\]

To find the minimum value, we take the derivative with respect to \(y\) and set it to zero. Let \(f(a, y) = 16a + 40y + 48\frac{y}{a} + 16\frac{y^3}{a^2}\). Then

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 40 + 48\frac{1}{a} + 48\frac{y^2}{a^2}.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get

\[
40 + 48\frac{1}{a} + 48\frac{y^2}{a^2} = 0.
\]

Since \(a\) and \(y\) are positive, the term \(48\frac{y^2}{a^2}\) is positive, and the equation \(40 + 48\frac{1}{a} + 48\frac{y^2}{a^2} = 0\) has no real solutions. Therefore, we need to consider the case when \(a = b = c\). Let \(a = b = c\). Then the expression becomes

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To determine the number of possible values for \( x \), we need to ensure that the total number of cards distributed is exactly 54, and that each player receives at least 5 cards. Let's start by setting up the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).

The total number of cards distributed is given by:
\[ x \cdot y = 54 \]

We are also given that each player receives at least 5 cards, so:
\[ y \geq 5 \]

Substituting \( y \) from the first equation, we get:

To find the maximum value of \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 54 \geq 5x \]
\[ x \leq \frac{54}{5} \]
\[ x \leq 10.8 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum value of \( x \) is 10. Therefore, \( x \) can take any integer value from 2 to 10, inclusive. Let's list these values:
\[ x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \]

To verify, we can check the corresponding values of \( y \) for each \( x \):
- If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \)
- If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = \frac{54}{3} = 18 \)
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = \frac{54}{4} = 13.5 \) (not an integer)
- If \( x = 5 \), then \( y = \frac{54}{5} = 10.8 \) (not an integer)
- If \( x = 6 \), then \( y = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \)

Substituting this into the equation, we have:

The direction vector of the line can be found by subtracting the coordinates of point \( A \) from the coordinates of point \( B \):

Next, we need to find a scalar \( k \) such that the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \) is a scalar multiple of the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). That is, we need to find \( k \) such that:

"To find the length of the side of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the parabola \(x^2 = 8y\) with one vertex at the vertex of the parabola, we start by identifying the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of the parabola \(x^2 = 8y\) is at \((0, 0)\).

Let the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\). Since these points lie on the parabola, we have:
\[x_1^2 = 8y_1 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2^2 = 8y_2.\]

The distance from the vertex \((0, 0)\) to \((x_1, y_1)\) is:

Similarly, the distance from the vertex \((0, 0)\) to \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{8y_2 + y_2^2}.\]
Since the triangle is equilateral, these distances are equal, so:
\[\sqrt{8y_1 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{8y_2 + y_2^2}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[8y_1 + y_1^2 = 8y_2 + y_2^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[y_1^2 - y_2^2 = 8(y_2 - y_1).\]
Factoring both sides, we get:
\[(y_1 - y_2)(y_1 + y_2) = 8(y_2 - y_1).\]
Since \(y_1 \neq y_2\), we can divide both sides by \(y_1 - y_2\):
\[y_1 + y_2 = -8.\]

Next, we use the fact that the distance between \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is the side length of the equilateral triangle. This distance is:
\[\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}.\]
Since \(x_1^2 = 8y_1\) and \(x_2^2 = 8y_2\), we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 8(y_1 - y_2) + 8(y_2 - y_1) = 8(y_1 - y_2).\]
Thus, the distance is:
\[\sqrt{8(y_1 - y_2) + (y_1 - y_2)^2} = \sqrt{(y_1 - y_2)^2 + 8(y_1 - y_2)}.\]
Let \(y_1 - y_2 = -8 - y_2\). Then:
\[\sqrt{(-8 - y_2)^2 + 8(-8 - y_2)} = \sqrt{64 + 16y_2 + y_2^2 - 64 - 8y_2} = \sqrt{y_2^2 + 8y_2}.\]
The side length of the equilateral triangle is:
\[\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{8y_1 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{8(-8 - y_2) + (-8 - y_2)^2} = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{64 + 16y_2 + y_2^2 - 64 - 8y_2} = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{y_2^2 + 8y_2}.\]
Since \(y_1 + y_2 = -8\), we have:

"To determine the probability that bothダン and Fle redis will be selected as the vice president, we need to consider the selection process for both the president and the vice president separately, and then find the combined probability of both selections being successful.

1. **Calculate the probability thatダン is selected as the president:**
   - There are 2 candidates for president:ダン and Fle redis.
   - Each candidate has a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) of being selected.
   - Therefore, the probability thatダン is selected as the president is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the probability that Fle redis is selected as the vice president given thatダン is selected as the president:**
   - There are 2 candidates for vice president: Fle redis andバーニー.
   - Each candidate has a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) of being selected.
   - Therefore, the probability that Fle redis is selected as the vice president is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the probability that Fle redis is selected as the president:**
   - There are 2 candidates for president:ダン and Fle redis.
   - Each candidate has a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) of being selected.
   - Therefore, the probability that Fle redis is selected as the president is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

   - Therefore, the probability thatダン is selected as the vice president is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

5. **Calculate the combined probability that bothダン and Fle redis will be selected as the vice president:**
   - There are two scenarios to consider: roman as president and Fle redis as vice president, or Fle redis as president and roman as vice president.
   - The probability of the first scenario (roman as president and Fle redis as vice president) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - The probability of the second scenario (Fle redis as president and roman as vice president) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - Therefore, the total probability that both roman and Fle redis will be selected as the vice president is \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the unknown number by \( x \).

According to the problem, when we add the inverse of the number to 3, the result is equal to the number divided by 7. The inverse of the number \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \). Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 3 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x}{7} \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term in the equation by \( x \):

\[ x \left( 3 + \frac{1}{x} \right) = x \left( \frac{x}{7} \right) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x + 1 = \frac{x^2}{7} \]

Next, we need to get rid of the fraction by multiplying every term by 7:

\[ 7(3x + 1) = x^2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 21x + 7 = x^2 \]

Rearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation, we get:

\[ x^2 - 21x - 7 = 0 \]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -21 \), and \( c = -7 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ x = \frac{-(-21) \pm \sqrt{(-21)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-7)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{441 + 28}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{469}}{2} \]

Since \( \sqrt{469} \) is not a perfect square, we can approximate the value, but for the purpose of this problem, we can leave it in its exact form. However, we need to check which of these solutions is a reasonable number in the context of the problem. Since the problem does not specify that the number must be an integer, we can conclude that the number is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{21 \pm \sqrt{469}}{2}} \]

However, if we are looking for an integer solution, we can check the possible integer values by trial and error or by using the quadratic formula again with approximate values. The integer solution that satisfies the equation is:

"To find the equation of the set of points that are the reflections of the points on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) across the point \((4,1)\), we start by considering a general point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the circle. The reflection of this point across \((4,1)\) is given by the point \((x_2, y_2)\) such that \((4,1)\) is the midpoint of the segment joining \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\). This means that:

\[
4 = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}
\]

Solving these equations for \(x_2\) and \(y_2\), we get:

\[
x_2 = 8 - x_1 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = 2 - y_1
\]

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), we substitute \(x_1 = 8 - x_2\) and \(y_1 = 2 - y_2\) into this equation:

\[
(8 - x_2)^2 + (2 - y_2)^2 = 25
\]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[
64 - 16x_2 + x_2^2 + 4 - 4y_2 + y_2^2 = 25
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 - 16x_2 - 4y_2 + 68 = 25
\]

Subtracting 25 from both sides, we obtain:

\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 - 16x_2 - 4y_2 + 43 = 0
\]

Thus, the equation of the set of points that are the reflections of the points on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) across the point \((4,1)\) is:

\[
x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 4y + 43 = 0

Comparing this with the general form \(x^2 + ay^2 + bx + cy + d = 0\), we identify the coefficients as \(a = 1\), \(b = -16\), \(c = -4\), and \(d = 43\). Therefore, the ordered quadruple \((a, b, c, d)\) is:

"To solve the problem, we start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers. For any two integers \(a\) and \(b\), the following equation holds:

\[
a \cdot b = \gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b]
\]

Given that \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
a \cdot b = 210 \cdot 210^3 = 210^4
\]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of 210, we can write \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers (i.e., \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\)). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
(210m) \cdot (210n) = 210^4
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
210^2 \cdot m \cdot n = 210^4 \implies m \cdot n = 210^2
\]

Next, we factorize 210:

\[
210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \implies 210^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2
\]

We need to find the number of pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(m \cdot n = 210^2\) and \(a < b\). Since \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\), the condition \(a < b\) translates to \(m < n\).

The number of factors of \(210^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2\) is given by:

\[
(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 81
\]

Each factor \(m\) of \(210^2\) corresponds to a unique factor \(n = \frac{210^2}{m}\). Since \(m < n\), we only count the pairs where \(m\) is less than the corresponding \(n\). Therefore, the number of such pairs is half of the total number of factor pairs, which is:

\[
\frac{81}{2} = 40.5
\]

Since the number of pairs must be an integer, we conclude that there are 40 pairs where \(m < n\).

Thus, the number of possible values for \(a\) is:

"To find the sum of the series \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \dots + 195 + 197 + 199\) and then determine the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the series as an arithmetic series:**
   The given series is an arithmetic series of odd numbers where the first term \(a = 1\), the common difference \(d = 2\), and the last term \(l = 199\).

2. **Find the number of terms in the series:**
   The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = a + (n-1)d
   \]
   Setting \(a_n = 199\), we get:
   \[
   199 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   199 = 1 + 2(n-1) \implies 198 = 2(n-1) \implies 99 = n-1 \implies n = 100
   \]
   So, there are 100 terms in the series.

3. **Find the sum of the series:**
   The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   S = \frac{100}{2} (1 + 199) = 50 \cdot 200 = 10000
   \]

4. **Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 7:**
   To find the remainder when 10000 is divided by 7, we first find the quotient:
   \[
   10000 \div 7 = 1428.5714
   \]
   The integer part of the quotient is 1428. Now, we multiply 1428 by 7 to find the product:
   \[
   1428 \cdot 7 = 9996
   \]
   The remainder is the difference between 10000 and 9996:
   \[
   10000 - 9996 = 4

"To determine the maximum perimeter of a triangle with two sides of length 8 and a third side of integer length, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Let's denote the length of the third side by \( x \). According to the triangle inequality theorem, we have the following three conditions:

1. \( 8 + 8 > x \)
2. \( 8 + x > 8 \)
3. \( 8 + x > 8 \)

The second and third inequalities simplify to \( x > 0 \), which is always true for a positive length. Therefore, the only relevant inequality is the first one:

\[ 8 + 8 > x \]
\[ 16 > x \]
\[ x < 16 \]

Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, the possible values for \( x \) are \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 15 \). To maximize the perimeter of the triangle, we should choose the largest possible value for \( x \), which is 15.

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the triangle with sides 8, 8, and 15:

where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height.

From the given diagram, we can identify the following:
- The length of the top base \( b_1 \) is 3 cm.
- The length of the bottom base \( b_2 \) is 9 cm.
- The height \( h \) is 5 cm.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

First, we add the lengths of the two bases:

\[

"To find the maximum value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) given that \( |ax^2 + bx + c| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), we start by considering the values of the quadratic polynomial at the endpoints and the vertex within the interval \([0, 1]\).

First, evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 0 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
P(0) = c, \quad P(1) = a + b + c, \quad P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c.
\]
Since \( |P(x)| \le 1 \) for \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), we have:
\[
|c| \le 1, \quad |a + b + c| \le 1, \quad \left| \frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2} + c \right| \le 1.
\]

Next, we express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of \( P(0) \), \( P(1) \), and \( P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \):
\[
a = 4P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 4P(1) + 4P(0), \quad b = -4P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2P(1) - 2P(0).
\]
Substituting these into \( |a| + |b| + |c| \), we get:
\[
|a| + |b| + |c| = \left| 4P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 4P(1) + 4P(0) \right| + \left| -4P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2P(1) - 2P(0) \right| + |P(0)|.
\]

To maximize \( |a| + |b| + |c| \), we consider the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \). This polynomial satisfies:
\[
P(0) = 1, \quad P(1) = 1, \quad P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{4}.

However, this polynomial does not satisfy \( |P(x)| \le 1 \) for all \( 0 \le x \le 1 \). Instead, we consider the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \) and its properties.

The correct polynomial that maximizes \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) is \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \), which gives:
\[

"To find the correct value of the expression \(\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\), we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of \(1+2i\) is \(1-2i\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{(-3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}
\]

First, we calculate the denominator:

\[
(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 1 + 4 = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the numerator:

\[
(-3+4i)(1-2i) = -3 \cdot 1 + (-3) \cdot (-2i) + 4i \cdot 1 + 4i \cdot (-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2 = -3 + 10i - 8(-1) = -3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i

So, the expression becomes:

\[

"To find the difference between the positive square root and the positive cube root of 64, we need to calculate each root separately and then find the difference between them.

First, let's find the positive square root of 64. The positive square root of a number \( x \) is the number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \). For \( x = 64 \), we have:
\[
y^2 = 64 \implies y = \sqrt{64} = 8
\]
So, the positive square root of 64 is 8.

Next, let's find the positive cube root of 64. The positive cube root of a number \( x \) is the number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \). For \( x = 64 \), we have:
\[
y^3 = 64 \implies y = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4
\]
So, the positive cube root of 64 is 4.

Now, we need to find the difference between the positive square root and the positive cube root of 64:

"To determine the number of distinct prime factors of \( A \) given that \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we start by finding the prime factorization of 500. We have:
\[ 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3. \]
The sum of the divisors function for a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is given by:
\[ (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \cdots + p_k^{e_k}). \]
Applying this to \( 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \), we get:
\[ (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 \times 156 = 1092. \]
So, \( A = 1092 \). Next, we need to find the prime factorization of 1092. We start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2:
\[ 1092 \div 2 = 546, \]
\[ 546 \div 2 = 273. \]
Since 273 is odd, we move to the next smallest prime number, 3:
\[ 273 \div 3 = 91. \]
Next, we check if 91 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 91 is \( 9 + 1 = 10 \), which is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3. We move to the next smallest prime number, 5. Since 91 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We move to the next smallest prime number, 7:
\[ 91 \div 7 = 13. \]
Finally, 13 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1092 is:
\[ 1092 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13. \]
The distinct prime factors of 1092 are 2, 3, 7, and 13. The sum of these distinct prime factors is:

"To find the coordinates of point \( P \) on the line \( y = -x + 6 \) such that \( PA = PO \), where \( A = (10, -10) \) and \( O = (0, 0) \), we start by letting the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y) \). Since \( P \) lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) as \( y = -x + 6 \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (x, -x + 6) \).

Next, we use the distance formula to express the distances \( PA \) and \( PO \). The distance formula between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

First, we calculate the distance \( PA \):
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + ((-x + 6) - (-10))^2} = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 20x + 100 + x^2 - 32x + 256} = \sqrt{2x^2 - 52x + 356}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance \( PO \):
\[
PO = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + ((-x + 6) - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2 - 12x + 36} = \sqrt{2x^2 - 12x + 36}
\]

Since \( PA = PO \), we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
\sqrt{2x^2 - 52x + 356} = \sqrt{2x^2 - 12x + 36}
\]

We can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:
\[
2x^2 - 52x + 356 = 2x^2 - 12x + 36
\]

Next, we simplify by subtracting \( 2x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
-52x + 356 = -12x + 36
\]

Then, we add \( 52x \) to both sides:
\[
356 = 40x + 36
\]

Next, we subtract 36 from both sides:
\[
320 = 40x
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 40:
\[
x = 8
\]

Now that we have \( x = 8 \), we substitute this value back into the equation of the line \( y = -x + 6 \) to find \( y \):
\[
y = -8 + 6 = -2

"To determine the one's digit of \(4\), we start by understanding the definition of the function \(n\). The function is defined as \(n = \underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\). For \(n = 4\), we have:

\[4 = \underbrace{ 4!^{{4!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4!}}}}}}_{4!}.\]

First, we calculate \(4!\):

\[4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24.\]

So, \(4\) becomes:

\[4 = \underbrace{ 24^{{24}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{24}}}}}}_{24}.\]

To find the one's digit of this expression, we need to focus on the one's digit of the base and the exponent. The one's digit of \(24\) is \(4\), so we need to find the one's digit of the expression:

\[4 = \underbrace{ 4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4}}}}}}_{24}.\]

Next, we observe the pattern in the one's digits of the powers of \(4\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
4^1 & = 4 \quad \text{(one's digit is 4)}, \\
4^2 & = 16 \quad \text{(one's digit is 6)}, \\
4^3 & = 64 \quad \text{(one's digit is 4)}, \\
4^4 & = 256 \quad \text{(one's digit is 6)}.
\end{aligned}

We see that the one's digits repeat every 2 numbers: \(4, 6, 4, 6, \ldots\). To determine the one's digit of \(4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4}}}}}\) with a base exponent of \(24\), we need to find the parity (odd or even) of the exponent \(4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4}}}}}\). Since the exponent is a power of \(4\) and any power of \(4\) is even, the exponent is even.

Therefore, the one's digit of \(4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4}}}}}\) is the same as the one's digit of \(4^2\), which is \(6\).

Thus, the one's digit of \(4\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Identify the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
- The zeros of the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\):
  \[
  x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x^2 = 81 \implies x = \pm 9
  \]
- The zeros of the denominator \(x(x - 36)\):
  \[
  x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 36
  \]

So, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

### Step 3: Determine the sign of the expression in each interval
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-\infty, -9)\).

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-9, 0)\).

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((0, 9)\).

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((9, 36)\).

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((36, \infty)\).

### Step 4: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 5: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"To determine the probability that two randomly selected numbers \( x \) and \( y \) from the interval \((0, 3)\) can form the sides of a triangle with a third side of length 1, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of a triangle, the following must hold:

1. \( a + b > c \)
2. \( a + c > b \)
3. \( b + c > a \)

In our case, let the sides of the triangle be \( x \), \( y \), and 1. The inequalities become:

1. \( x + y > 1 \)
2. \( x + 1 > y \) or \( x > y - 1 \)
3. \( y + 1 > x \) or \( y > x - 1 \)

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are both in the interval \((0, 3)\), the inequalities \( x > y - 1 \) and \( y > x - 1 \) are always true because the minimum value of \( y - 1 \) and \( x - 1 \) is \(-2\), which is less than 0. Therefore, the only relevant inequality is \( x + y > 1 \).

We need to find the area of the region in the \( xy \)-plane where \( x + y > 1 \) and \( 0 < x < 3 \) and \( 0 < y < 3 \). This region is a triangle with vertices at \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((3, 3)\).

"To find the maximum area of the football field, we need to consider the structure of the track, which consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on each end. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the two semicircles together form a full circle, the total length of the track is given by:

\[ L + \pi W = 400 \]

We want to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:

\[ A = L \times W \]

From the equation \( L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ L = 400 - \pi W \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = (400 - \pi W) W = 400W - \pi W^2 \]

This is a quadratic function in terms of \( W \), and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( W^2 \) is negative). The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 400 \), so the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:

\[ W = -\frac{400}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{400}{2\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[ L = 400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 400 - 200 = 200 \]

The area \( A \) is then:

\[ A = L \times W = 200 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi} \]

2. For the interval \((-2, 7)\), we choose \(x = 0\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 < 0\]
   So, the product is negative in this interval.

3. For the interval \((7, \infty)\), we choose \(x = 8\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0\]
   So, the product is positive in this interval.

We also need to check the values at the roots \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\):
\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\]
So, the product is zero at these points.

Therefore, the product \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) is less than or equal to zero in the interval \([-2, 7]\).

"To determine how much more money Kayser will hold in Euromoney compared to Pounds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Kayser will withdraw in Pounds.
2. Calculate the amount of money Kayser will withdraw in Euromoney.
3. Find the difference between the amount in Pounds and the amount in Euromoney.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Kayser will withdraw in Pounds. She has 300 meters of money and plans to withdraw half of it in Pounds. Since 1 Pounds is equal to 1.64 USD, we can convert the amount in meters to Pounds as follows:
\[

Next, let's calculate the amount of money Kayser will withdraw in Euromoney. She plans to withdraw the other half of the money in Euromoney. Since 1 Euromoney is equal to 1.32 USD, we can convert the amount in meters to Euromoney as follows:

1. **Understand the absolute value inequality**: The inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \) means that the distance between \( x \) and 2 on the number line is at most 5.6. This can be rewritten as a compound inequality:
   \[
   -5.6 \leq x-2 \leq 5.6
   \]

2. **Isolate \( x \) in the compound inequality**: To isolate \( x \), we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   -5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2
   \]
   Simplifying the left and right sides, we get:
   \[
   -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6

3. **Identify the integer solutions**: The integers that satisfy the inequality \( -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \) are:

"To find the value of the function \( f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4 \) at \( x = -2 \), we need to substitute \( -2 \) for \( x \) in the function and then simplify step by step.

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the function:
   \[
   f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4
   \]

2. Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4
   \]

3. Calculate \( (-2)^2 \):
   \[
   (-2)^2 = 4
   \]
   So the expression becomes:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(4) + 3(-2) + 4
   \]

4. Multiply \( 5 \) by \( 4 \):
   \[
   5(4) = 20
   \]
   So the expression now is:
   \[
   f(-2) = 20 + 3(-2) + 4

5. Multiply \( 3 \) by \( -2 \):
   \[
   3(-2) = -6

   So the expression now is:
   \[
   f(-2) = 20 - 6 + 4
   \]

6. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   \[
   20 - 6 = 14

   So the expression now is:
   \[
   f(-2) = 14 + 4

"To determine the minimum real number \( x \) in the domain of the function \( g(x) = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \), we first need to find the domain of the function. The expression inside the square root must be non-negative, so we start by solving the inequality:

\[
(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \geq 0
\]

We can simplify the left-hand side by expanding both squares:

\[
(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
\[
(x-8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64
\]

Subtracting these two expressions, we get:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 = 10x - 55
\]

So the inequality becomes:

\[
10x - 55 \geq 0
\]

Solving for \( x \), we add 55 to both sides:

\[
10x \geq 55
\]

Then we divide both sides by 10:

\[
x \geq \frac{55}{10} = 5.5

Therefore, the domain of the function \( g(x) \) is \( x \geq 5.5 \). The minimum real number in this domain is \( 5.5 \).

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(ST = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sides of the triangle:**
   - Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.
   - Let the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):
     \[
     x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2 \implies x^2 + 4 = 25 \implies x^2 = 21 \implies x = \sqrt{21}
     \]

2. **Determine the sides relative to angle \(T\):**
   - In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle T\) is the other non-right angle, \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\).
   - The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

3. **Find \(\cos{R}\):**
   - The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. So, \(\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have \(\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the graph \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance between a point \((x, y)\) on the graph and the origin. The distance \(D\) is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

So, the critical points are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\).

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

We express this distance in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), where \(a\) is a positive integer and \(b\) is a positive integer. Here, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is 1 more than a perfect square (9), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron.

Let's denote the vertices as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) is opposite to \( B \), \( C \) is opposite to \( D \), and \( E \) is opposite to \( F \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Since the octahedron is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices must be equal.

Since the force applied by Jenna to the soft ball is the same as the force applied by the baseball, we can write:

\[ F_{\text{Jenna}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using the force formula, we can express the accelerations of the soft ball and the baseball as:

\[ a_{\text{Jenna}} = \frac{F_{\text{Jenna}}}{m_{\text{Jenna}}} \]
\[ a_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{F_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{baseball}}} \]

Since \( F_{\text{Jenna}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \), we can substitute \( F_{\text{baseball}} \) for \( F_{\text{Jenna}} \) in the equation for \( a_{\text{Jenna}} \):

\[ a_{\text{Jenna}} = \frac{F_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{Jenna}}} \]

Now, we can find the ratio of the accelerations of the soft ball to the baseball:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jenna}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{\frac{F_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{Jenna}}}}{\frac{F_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{baseball}}}} = \frac{F_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{Jenna}}} \cdot \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{F_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{Jenna}}} \]

Given that the mass of the soft ball is \( 200 \) g and the mass of the baseball is \( 150 \) g, we substitute these values into the equation:

First, let's express \( z \) as a function of \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y. \]

Brav maqta will choose \( y \) to minimize the maximum value of \( z \) for a given \( x \). To do this, we first find the critical points of \( z \) with respect to \( y \) by taking the partial derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( y \) and setting it to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -2(2x - y) - 4y - 3 = -4x + 2y - 4y - 3 = -4x - 2y - 3. \]
Setting the partial derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ -4x - 2y - 3 = 0 \implies y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}. \]

Next, we substitute \( y = -2x - \frac{3}{2} \) back into the function \( z \) to find the value of \( z \) at this critical point:
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = (2x - (-2x - \frac{3}{2}))^2 - 2\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 3\left(-2x - \frac{3}{2}\right). \]
Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = (4x + \frac{3}{2})^2 - 2\left(4x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}\right) + 6x + \frac{9}{2}. \]
Expanding and simplifying further, we have:
\[ z\left(x, -2x - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 16x^2 + 12x + \frac{9}{4} - 8x^2 - 12x - \frac{9}{2} + 6x + \frac{9}{2} = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}. \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes the maximum value of \( 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4} \).

The quadrilateral is divided into several triangles, with one of them being the smaller square \(e\). The triangles are all isosceles, and the pie slice is one of these triangles. The pie slice is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as one of the sides of the square \(e\).

First, we need to find the area of the square \(e\). Since the pie slice is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the side of the square \(e\), and the other two sides of the triangle are equal (because the triangles are isosceles), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square \(e\).

Let the side length of the square \(e\) be \(s\). The hypotenuse of the right triangle is \(s\sqrt{2}\) (since the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle with legs of length \(a\) is \(a\sqrt{2}\)). This hypotenuse is also a side of the square \(e\), so:

The larger semicircle has a radius of 14 inches. The center of the larger semicircle is \(Q\), and the points \(A\) and \(B\) are such that \(AQ\) and \(BQ\) are perpendicular to each other. The smaller semicircle is tangent to the larger semicircle at a point on the arc \(AB\) and is also tangent to the lines \(AQ\) and \(BQ\).

The distance from the center of the smaller semicircle to the center \(Q\) of the larger semicircle is \(14 - r\).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 28\), and \(c = -196\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
r = \frac{-28 \pm \sqrt{28^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-196)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-28 \pm \sqrt{784 + 784}}{2} = \frac{-28 \pm \sqrt{1568}}{2} = \frac{-28 \pm 2\sqrt{392}}{2} = \frac{-28 \pm 2 \cdot 14\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{-28 \pm 28\sqrt{2}}{2} = -14 \pm 14\sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(r\) must be a positive value, we take the positive root:
\[
r = -14 + 14\sqrt{2} = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( |z| = 1 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 1 \), we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). Then, we have:
\[ 1 + z = 1 + e^{i\theta} = 1 + \cos \theta + i \sin \theta, \]
and
\[ 1 - z + z^2 = 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{2i\theta} = 1 - \cos \theta + i \sin \theta + \cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta. \]
Using the double-angle identities \( \cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - 1 \) and \( \sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ 1 - z + z^2 = 1 - \cos \theta + i \sin \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta - 1 + 2i \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta + i (2 \sin \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta). \]

Next, we calculate the magnitudes \( |1 + z| \) and \( |1 - z + z^2| \):
\[ |1 + z| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 + 2\cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos \theta} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos \theta)} = \sqrt{4 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} = 2 \left| \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right| = 2 \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \quad \text{(since \( \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \geq 0 \) for the maximum value)} \]
and
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta)^2 + (2 \sin \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta)^2} = \sqrt{(2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta (2 \cos \theta + 1)^2} = \sqrt{(2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta + \sin \theta (2 \cos \theta + 1))^2} = |2\cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta + \sin \theta (2 \cos \theta + 1)|. \]

To find the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \), we can test some specific values of \( \theta \). Let's try \( \theta = 0 \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 + 1| = 2, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 - 1 + 1| = 1, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 2 + 1 = 3. \]

Now, let's try \( \theta = \pi \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 - 1| = 0, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 0 + 3 = 3. \]

Finally, let's try \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 + i| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 - i - 1| = |-i| = 1, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{2} + 1. \]

Since \( \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.414 \) is less than 3, the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) is indeed 3. Therefore, the maximum value is:

"To solve the problem, we need to rotate the complex number \( -4 - 5i \) by \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise around the origin and then multiply the result by 3. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Rotate the complex number by \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise
A complex number \( z = a + bi \) can be represented in the complex plane as a vector from the origin to the point \( (a, b) \). Rotating this vector by \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying the complex number by \( i \). This is because multiplying by \( i \) corresponds to a rotation by \( 90^\circ \) in the complex plane.

So, we need to compute \( i(-4 - 5i) \).

First, distribute \( i \):
\[
i(-4 - 5i) = -4i - 5i^2
\]

Recall that \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
\[
-4i - 5(-1) = -4i + 5 = 5 - 4i
\]

Thus, the complex number after a \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise rotation is \( 5 - 4i \).

### Step 2: Multiply the result by 3
Now, we need to multiply the complex number \( 5 - 4i \) by 3:
\[
3(5 - 4i) = 3 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 4i = 15 - 12i
\]

Therefore, the result of the operation is:

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We now compare the digits in the same positions:

- The first digit (from the right) is 6 in base 7 and 5 in base 8. They are different.
- The second digit is 5 in base 7 and 6 in base 8. They are different.
- The third digit is 5 in base 7 and 1 in base 8. They are different.
- The fourth digit is 1 in base 7 and 1 in base 8. They are the same.

There is only one digit that is the same in the same position in both representations.

"To determine how many boxes do not contain either a pencil or a pen, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of boxes containing pencils.
- Let \( B \) be the set of boxes containing pens.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of boxes is \( |U| = 10 \).
- The number of boxes containing pencils is \( |A| = 5 \).
- The number of boxes containing pens is \( |B| = 4 \).
- The number of boxes containing both pencils and pens is \( |A \cap B| = 2 \).

We need to find the number of boxes that contain either a pencil or a pen or both. This is given by the union of sets \( A \) and \( B \), denoted as \( |A \cup B| \). According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the given values, we get:

\[
|A \cup B| = 5 + 4 - 2 = 7
\]

So, there are 7 boxes that contain either a pencil or a pen or both. To find the number of boxes that do not contain either a pencil or a pen, we subtract the number of boxes that contain either a pencil or a pen or both from the total number of boxes:

\[
|U| - |A \cup B| = 10 - 7 = 3

Therefore, the number of boxes that do not contain either a pencil or a pen is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

The number of such functions is given by the formula \(5^3\), because each of the 3 people has 5 choices of offices.

Let's calculate this step by step:

"To find the remainder when 2004 is divided by 12, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 2004\) and \(b = 12\). First, we need to find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{2004}{12} \right\rfloor
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{2004}{12} = 167

So, the quotient \(q\) is 167. Now, we can find the remainder \(r\) using the formula \(r = a - bq\):

\[
r = 2004 - 12 \times 167
\]

First, calculate \(12 \times 167\):

\[
12 \times 167 = 2004
\]

Now, substitute this back into the formula for the remainder:

\[

We set \( f(x) \) equal to \( \frac{1}{5} \) and solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2}{x+1} = \frac{1}{5} \]

To eliminate the denominators, we cross-multiply:

\[ 2 \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot (x+1) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 10 = x + 1 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 - 1 \]

The vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) is along the x-axis, so the line of reflection is the y-axis. The normal vector to the y-axis is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

The reflection matrix across the y-axis is given by:
\[

"To find the equation of the hyperbola and the distance between its foci, we start by noting that the asymptotes of a hyperbola are given by the equations \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 17 - 2x\). These lines can be rewritten as \(y - 2x + 3 = 0\) and \(y + 2x - 17 = 0\). The equations of the asymptotes for a hyperbola of the form \(\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1\) are given by \(y - k = \pm \frac{a}{b}(x - h)\). From the given asymptotes, we can see that \(\frac{a}{b} = 2\), so \(a = 2b\).

The center \((h, k)\) of the hyperbola is the intersection of the asymptotes. To find the center, we solve the system of equations:
\[
y - 2x + 3 = 0
\]
\[
y + 2x - 17 = 0
\]
Adding these two equations, we get:
\[
2y - 14 = 0 \implies y = 7
\]
Substituting \(y = 7\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
7 - 2x + 3 = 0 \implies 10 - 2x = 0 \implies x = 5
\]
So, the center of the hyperbola is \((5, 7)\).

The equation of the hyperbola can now be written as:
\[
\frac{(y - 7)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - 5)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
Since \(a = 2b\), we substitute \(a^2 = 4b^2\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4b^2} - \frac{(x - 5)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
We know that the hyperbola passes through the point \((4, 7)\). Substituting \(x = 4\) and \(y = 7\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{(7 - 7)^2}{4b^2} - \frac{(4 - 5)^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies 0 - \frac{1}{b^2} = 1 \implies -\frac{1}{b^2} = 1 \implies b^2 = -1
\]
This step seems incorrect, so let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the correct form of the hyperbola equation and recheck the calculations. The correct form should be:

"To determine the non-zero value of \( N \) such that the number \( 21420N \) is divisible by 6, we need to check the divisibility rules for both 2 and 3, since a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

### Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Therefore, \( N \) must be an even number.

### Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The number \( 21420N \) has digits 2, 1, 4, 2, 0, and \( N \). The sum of the known digits is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9 \]
So, the sum of the digits of \( 21420N \) is:
\[ 9 + N \]
For \( 21420N \) to be divisible by 3, \( 9 + N \) must be divisible by 3. Since 9 is already divisible by 3, \( N \) must also be divisible by 3.

### Step 3: Combine the conditions
From the above steps, \( N \) must be both even and divisible by 3. The smallest non-zero even number divisible by 3 is 6. Therefore, \( N = 6 \) is the smallest non-zero value that satisfies both conditions.

To verify, we substitute \( N = 6 \) into the number \( 21420N \):
\[ 214206 \]
The last digit is 6, so it is divisible by 2. The sum of the digits is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 6 = 15 \]
Since 15 is divisible by 3, \( 214206 \) is divisible by 3. Therefore, \( 214206 \) is divisible by both 2 and 3, and hence by 6.

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of hand shakes that took place during the magic show is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",60,"[60, '60']",True
"To find \( P(16) \), we start by analyzing the given conditions for the polynomial \( P(x) \). We know that \( P(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial, so we can write it in the form:
\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. \]
We are given the inequalities:
\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3. \]
First, let's evaluate these inequalities at \( x = 1 \):
\[ 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1 \le P(1) \le 2 \cdot 1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 + 3 = 1. \]
This implies that:
\[ P(1) = 1. \]
Next, let's evaluate these inequalities at \( x = 2 \):
\[ 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 2 \le P(2) \le 2 \cdot 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 + 3 = 3. \]
This implies that:
\[ 2 \le P(2) \le 3. \]
Now, let's evaluate these inequalities at \( x = 11 \):
\[ 11^2 - 2 \cdot 11 + 2 = 101 \le P(11) \le 2 \cdot 11^2 - 4 \cdot 11 + 3 = 211. \]
We are given that \( P(11) = 181 \), so:
\[ 101 \le 181 \le 211. \]
This is consistent with the given condition. Now, let's evaluate these inequalities at \( x = 16 \):
\[ 16^2 - 2 \cdot 16 + 2 = 226 \le P(16) \le 2 \cdot 16^2 - 4 \cdot 16 + 3 = 443. \]
To find the exact value of \( P(16) \), we need to consider the form of \( P(x) \). Since \( P(x) \) must satisfy the given inequalities for all real \( x \), and given the specific values at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 11 \), we can assume that \( P(x) \) is the average of the lower and upper bounds at \( x = 11 \) when \( x = 16 \). However, a simpler approach is to assume that \( P(x) \) is a linear combination of the lower and upper bounds that fits the given conditions. By inspection or by solving a system of equations, we can find that:
\[ P(x) = x^2 - x + 2. \]
This polynomial satisfies:
\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \le x^2 - x + 2 \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3. \]
And it also satisfies \( P(11) = 181 \):
\[ P(11) = 11^2 - 11 + 2 = 121 - 11 + 2 = 112. \]
However, this is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the polynomial. The correct polynomial is:
\[ P(x) = x^2 - x + 2. \]
This polynomial satisfies:
\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \le x^2 - x + 2 \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3. \]
And it also satisfies \( P(11) = 181 \):
\[ P(11) = 11^2 - 11 + 2 = 121 - 11 + 2 = 112. \]
Therefore, the correct value of \( P(16) \) is:
\[ P(16) = 16^2 - 16 + 2 = 256 - 16 + 2 = 242. \]
Thus, the value of \( P(16) \) is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Multiply the coefficients in the numerator:**
   The coefficients are 10 and 4. So, we have:
   \[
   10 \times 4 = 40
   \]

2. **Combine the \(r\) terms in the numerator:**
   The \(r\) terms are \(r^3\) and \(r^6\). When multiplying powers with the same base, we add the exponents:
   \[
   r^3 \times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9
   \]
   So, the numerator becomes:
   \[

3. **Write the expression with the simplified numerator:**
   Now, the expression is:

"To solve the equation \((3)5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Isolate the term involving \(a\).
3. Solve for \(a\).
4. Find the sum of the solutions for \(a\).

Let's start with the equation:
\[
(3)5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

First, calculate \(5^2\):
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
3 \cdot 25 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]
Simplify \(3 \cdot 25\):
\[
3 \cdot 25 = 75
\]
So the equation is now:
\[
75 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

Next, isolate the term involving \(a\) by subtracting 75 from both sides:
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63 - 75
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
63 - 75 = -12
\]
So the equation is:
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = -12
\]

To eliminate the negative sign, multiply both sides by -1:
\[
4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 12
\]

Next, eliminate the division by 3 by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
4(5-a)^2 = 36
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[
(5-a)^2 = 9
\]

To solve for \(5-a\), take the square root of both sides:
\[
5-a = \pm 3
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
5-a = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 5-a = -3
\]

Solve the first equation:
\[
5-a = 3 \implies -a = 3-5 \implies -a = -2 \implies a = 2
\]

Solve the second equation:
\[
5-a = -3 \implies -a = -3-5 \implies -a = -8 \implies a = 8
\]

The solutions for \(a\) are \(a = 2\) and \(a = 8\). To find the sum of the solutions, add them together:
\[
2 + 8 = 10

Therefore, the sum of the values of \(a\) that satisfy the equation is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we first reduce the bases modulo 11.

First, we reduce 129 modulo 11:
\[129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[129 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Next, we reduce 96 modulo 11:
\[96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[96 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, the expression \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) becomes \(8^{34} + 8^{38}\) modulo 11. We can factor out \(8^{34}\):
\[8^{34} + 8^{38} = 8^{34}(1 + 8^4).\]

Next, we need to find \(8^4 \mod 11\):
\[8^2 = 64 \equiv 9 \pmod{11},\]
\[8^4 = (8^2)^2 \equiv 9^2 = 81 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

So, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:
\[1 + 8^4 \equiv 1 + 4 = 5 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, the expression is:
\[8^{34}(1 + 8^4) \equiv 8^{34} \cdot 5 \pmod{11}.\]

To simplify \(8^{34} \mod 11\), we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\) for a prime \(p\) and an integer \(a\) not divisible by \(p\). Here, \(a = 8\) and \(p = 11\), so:
\[8^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}.\]

We can write \(8^{34}\) as:
\[8^{34} = 8^{3 \cdot 10 + 4} = (8^{10})^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 8^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[8^{34} \cdot 5 \equiv 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}.\]

First, we calculate \(\sin^2 18^\circ\):
\[
\sin^2 18^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{(\sqrt{5} - 1)^2}{16} = \frac{5 - 2\sqrt{5} + 1}{16} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{8}.
\]

Next, we calculate \(\sin^3 18^\circ\):
\[
\sin^3 18^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right)^3 = \frac{(\sqrt{5} - 1)^3}{64} = \frac{5\sqrt{5} - 15 + 3\sqrt{5} - 1}{64} = \frac{8\sqrt{5} - 16}{64} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 2}{8}.
\]

Now, we add \(\sin^3 18^\circ\) and \(\sin^2 18^\circ\):
\[
\sin^3 18^\circ + \sin^2 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 2}{8} + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 2 + 3 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{1}{8}.

Thus, the value of \(\sin^3 18^\circ + \sin^2 18^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}\).","[1/8, '\\frac{1}{8}']",\frac{1}{8},"[1/8, '\\frac{1}{8}']",True

首先，将直線 \(y = 2x - 2\) 转化为 \(Ax + By + C = 0\) 的形式。将 \(y\) 换成 \(2x - 2\)，我们有：

\[

计算 \(2(6) = 12\)，\(0\) 与 \(-2\) 的和是 \(-2\)，所以：

The cross product \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

We set this equal to \(\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}\), giving us the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
2z + 5y = 90, \\
-5x - z = 30, \\
y - 2x = 30.
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the third equation for \(y\):

\[
y = 2x + 30.
\]

Next, substitute \(y = 2x + 30\) into the first equation:

\[
2z + 5(2x + 30) = 90 \implies 2z + 10x + 150 = 90 \implies 2z + 10x = -60 \implies z + 5x = -30 \implies z = -5x - 30.
\]

Now substitute \(y = 2x + 30\) and \(z = -5x - 30\) into the second equation:

\[
-5x - (-5x - 30) = 30 \implies -5x + 5x + 30 = 30 \implies 30 = 30.
\]

This equation is true for all \(x\), so it does not provide any new information. Therefore, the general solution to the system is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x + 30 \\ -5x - 30 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude, we minimize the expression:

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + (2x + 30)^2 + (-5x - 30)^2}.
\]

First, expand the expression inside the square root:

\[
x^2 + (2x + 30)^2 + (-5x - 30)^2 = x^2 + (4x^2 + 120x + 900) + (25x^2 + 300x + 900) = 30x^2 + 420x + 1800.

To minimize this quadratic function, we find the vertex of the parabola, which occurs at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\) where \(a = 30\) and \(b = 420\):

\[
x = -\frac{420}{2 \cdot 30} = -\frac{420}{60} = -7.

Substitute \(x = -7\) back into the expression for \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[

\[

First, we need to compute \(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 36 + 9 = 49

"To solve the equation \(\arccos x + \arccos 2x + \arccos 3x = \pi\), we start by letting \(\theta = \arccos x\), \(\phi = \arccos 2x\), and \(\psi = \arccos 3x\). This gives us the equation \(\theta + \phi + \psi = \pi\), which implies \(\psi = \pi - \theta - \phi\). Taking the cosine of both sides, we get:

\[
\cos \psi = \cos (\pi - \theta - \phi) = -\cos (\theta + \phi).
\]

Since \(\psi = \arccos 3x\), we have \(\cos \psi = 3x\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
3x = -\cos (\theta + \phi).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we have:

\[
\cos (\theta + \phi) = \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi.
\]

Since \(\theta = \arccos x\) and \(\phi = \arccos 2x\), we have \(\cos \theta = x\) and \(\cos \phi = 2x\). The sine values are given by \(\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) and \(\sin \phi = \sqrt{1 - (2x)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}\). Substituting these into the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos (\theta + \phi) = x \cdot 2x - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 4x^2} = 2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.

Thus, we have:

\[
3x = -\left(2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}\right) = -2x^2 + \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)} = 2x^2 + 3x.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2) = (2x^2 + 3x)^2.
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:

\[
1 - 5x^2 + 4x^4 = 4x^4 + 12x^3 + 9x^2.
\]

Subtracting \(4x^4\) from both sides, we have:

\[
1 - 5x^2 = 12x^3 + 9x^2.

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[

Thus, the polynomial equation is:

\]
Using \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we get:

Simplifying further, we get:
\[

"To find the largest integer less than 2010 that satisfies the given conditions, we need to solve the following system of congruences:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}
\end{cases}
\]

First, observe that the second and third congruences are identical:
\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \quad \text{and} \quad x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}
\]

Since 11 and 13 are coprime, we can combine these congruences into a single congruence:
\[
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\]

Now, we have the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\end{cases}
\]

We can express \(x\) in terms of the second congruence:
\[
x = 143k + 10 \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]

Substitute this expression into the first congruence:
\[
143k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

First, reduce 143 modulo 7:
\[
143 \div 7 = 20 \quad \text{remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 143 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Substitute this back into the congruence:
\[
3k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
3k \equiv -5 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(-5 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we have:
\[
3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]

To solve for \(k\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7. The inverse \(y\) satisfies:
\[
3y \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

We can test values for \(y\):
\[
3 \cdot 1 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 2 = 6 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 3 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 5 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5. Multiply both sides of the congruence \(3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) by 5:
\[
k \equiv 10 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
k \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, \(k\) can be written as:
\[
k = 7m + 3 \quad \text{for some integer } m
\]

Substitute this back into the expression for \(x\):
\[
x = 143(7m + 3) + 10 = 1001m + 429 + 10 = 1001m + 439
\]

The largest integer \(x\) less than 2010 occurs when \(m\) is the largest integer such that:
\[
1001m + 439 < 2010
\]

Subtract 439 from both sides:
\[
1001m < 1571
\]

Divide by 1001:
\[
m < \frac{1571}{1001} \approx 1.5694
\]

The largest integer \(m\) is 1. Substitute \(m = 1\) back into the expression for \(x\):
\[
x = 1001 \cdot 1 + 439 = 1440
\]

Therefore, the largest integer less than 2010 that satisfies all the given conditions is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationship between \( y \) and \( x \). The problem states that \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{x} \). This means that the product of \( y \) and \( \sqrt{x} \) is a constant. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ y \sqrt{x} = k \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

We are given that when \( x = 24 \), \( y = 15 \). We can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 15 \sqrt{24} = k \]

First, we need to calculate \( \sqrt{24} \):

\[ \sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = 2 \sqrt{6} \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 \cdot 2 \sqrt{6} = k \]
\[ k = 30 \sqrt{6} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 3 \). We substitute \( y = 3 \) and \( k = 30 \sqrt{6} \) into the equation \( y \sqrt{x} = k \):

\[ 3 \sqrt{x} = 30 \sqrt{6} \]

To solve for \( \sqrt{x} \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \sqrt{x} = 10 \sqrt{6} \]

To find \( x \), we square both sides of the equation:

\[ x = (10 \sqrt{6})^2 \]
\[ x = 100 \cdot 6 \]
\[ x = 600 \]

"To find the expression for \(AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2\) where \(F\) is the midpoint of the line segment joining the centroid \(G\) and the orthocenter \(H\) of triangle \(ABC\), we start by using some known properties of the centroid and the orthocenter.

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides the line segment joining the orthocenter \(H\) and the circumcenter \(O\) in the ratio 2:1. That is, \(HG = 2GO\). Since \(F\) is the midpoint of \(GH\), we have \(GF = FH = \frac{1}{2}GH = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2GO = GO\).

Next, we use the fact that the distance from the centroid \(G\) to a vertex of the triangle is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from the orthocenter \(H\) to the opposite side.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the diagonal of the square given that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the equilateral triangle and the area of the equilateral triangle is \(16\sqrt{3}\) square centimeters.

First, let's find the side length of the equilateral triangle. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is given by \(3s\), where \(s\) is the side length. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
We know the area is \(16\sqrt{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 16\sqrt{3}
\]
To solve for \(s^2\), we divide both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{1}{4} s^2 = 16
\]
Next, we multiply both sides by 4:
\[
s^2 = 64
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 8
\]
So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 8 centimeters. The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is:
\[
3s = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ centimeters}
\]
Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the square is also 24 centimeters. The perimeter of a square is given by \(4a\), where \(a\) is the side length of the square. So, we can set up the equation:
\[

Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 4:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given that \(a + b + c + d = 1\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-HM (Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean) inequality in a strategic way. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, define the function \(f(a, b, c, d) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) and the constraint \(g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 1 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to solve the system of equations given by \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\) and \(g(a, b, c, d) = 0\).

First, compute the gradients:
\[
\nabla f = \left( -\frac{1}{a^2}, -\frac{1}{b^2}, -\frac{4}{c^2}, -\frac{16}{d^2} \right)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (1, 1, 1, 1)
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get:
\[
-\frac{1}{a^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{1}{b^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{4}{c^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{16}{d^2} = \lambda
\]

From these equations, we can express \(\lambda\) in terms of \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\):
\[
\lambda = -\frac{1}{a^2} = -\frac{1}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{c^2} = -\frac{16}{d^2}
\]

This gives us the following relationships:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{1}{b^2} \implies a = b
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{4}{c^2} \implies c = 2a
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{16}{d^2} \implies d = 4a
\]

Substitute \(b = a\), \(c = 2a\), and \(d = 4a\) into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):
\[
a + a + 2a + 4a = 1 \implies 8a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Then, \(b = \frac{1}{8}\), \(c = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(d = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2}\).

Now, substitute these values back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{4}{\frac{1}{4}} + \frac{16}{\frac{1}{2}} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64

"To find the minimum value of \(a^4 + b^8\) given that \(ab^2 = 5\), we start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\). From the constraint \(ab^2 = 5\), we can solve for \(a\):

\[a = \frac{5}{b^2}.\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(a\) into the function \(a^4 + b^8\):

\[a^4 + b^8 = \left(\frac{5}{b^2}\right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.\]

Let \(x = b^8\). Then the expression becomes a function of \(x\):

\[f(x) = \frac{625}{x} + x.\]

To find the minimum value of \(f(x)\), we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

\[f'(x) = -\frac{625}{x^2} + 1.\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[-\frac{625}{x^2} + 1 = 0 \implies \frac{625}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 625 \implies x = 25.\]

Since \(x = b^8\) and \(b\) is a positive real number, \(x\) must be positive, so we have \(x = 25\).

To confirm that this critical point is a minimum, we check the second derivative of \(f(x)\):

\[f''(x) = \frac{1250}{x^3}.\]

Since \(f''(x) > 0\) for \(x > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) has a local minimum at \(x = 25\).

Now, we substitute \(x = 25\) back into the function \(f(x)\):

\[f(25) = \frac{625}{25} + 25 = 25 + 25 = 50.\]

3. Subtract 8 from 9 to get a remainder of 1.

"To find the range of the function \( f(x) = (\arccos x)^2 + (\arcsin x)^2 \), we start by using the identity that relates the inverse trigonometric functions \(\arccos x\) and \(\arcsin x\):
\[
\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
From this identity, we can express \(\arccos x\) in terms of \(\arcsin x\):
\[
\arccos x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x.
\]
Substituting this into the function \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(x) = \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \right)^2 + (\arcsin x)^2.
\]
Expanding the square, we have:
\[
f(x) = \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \arcsin x + (\arcsin x)^2 + (\arcsin x)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \arcsin x + 2 (\arcsin x)^2.
\]
Let \( y = \arcsin x \). Since \( x \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( y \) ranges from \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) can be rewritten as:
\[
g(y) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi y + 2 y^2,
\]
where \( y \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \).

Next, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the quadratic function \( g(y) \) on the interval \(\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]\). The vertex of a parabola given by \( ay^2 + by + c \) occurs at \( y = -\frac{b}{2a} \). For the function \( g(y) = 2y^2 - \pi y + \frac{\pi^2}{4} \), we have \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -\pi \), so the vertex is at:
\[
y = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]
Since the coefficient of \( y^2 \) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \( g(y) \) on the interval \(\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]\) occurs at \( y = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Substituting \( y = \frac{\pi}{4} \) into \( g(y) \), we get:
\[
g\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} + 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{4} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{16} = \frac{\pi^2}{8}.
\]
Next, we evaluate \( g(y) \) at the endpoints of the interval, \( y = -\frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\pi}{2} \):
\[
g\left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) + 2 \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} = \frac{5\pi^2}{4},
\]
\[
g\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \pi \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) + 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{4} - \frac{\pi^2}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{2} = \frac{\pi^2}{4}.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of \( g(y) \) is \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\) and the maximum value is \(\frac{5\pi^2}{4}\). Hence, the range of the function \( f(x) \) is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the recurrence relation given by \( f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) \) for \( n \ge 1 \) and the initial condition \( f(1) = f(1986) \).

First, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns:
\[
f(2) = (-1)^2 \cdot 1 - 2f(1) = 1 - 2f(1)
\]
\[
f(3) = (-1)^3 \cdot 2 - 2f(2) = -2 - 2(1 - 2f(1)) = -2 - 2 + 4f(1) = -4 + 4f(1)
\]
\[
f(4) = (-1)^4 \cdot 3 - 2f(3) = 3 - 2(-4 + 4f(1)) = 3 + 8 - 8f(1) = 11 - 8f(1)
\]

Next, we need to find a general form for \( f(n) \). To do this, we will look at the sequence modulo 2. Notice that the recurrence relation changes depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd:
- If \( n \) is odd, then \( (-1)^{n+1} = 1 \), so \( f(n+1) = n - 2f(n) \).
- If \( n \) is even, then \( (-1)^{n+1} = -1 \), so \( f(n+1) = -n - 2f(n) \).

Let's consider the sequence modulo 2:
- If \( n \) is odd, then \( f(n+1) \equiv n \pmod{2} \).
- If \( n \) is even, then \( f(n+1) \equiv -n \equiv n \pmod{2} \).

This means that \( f(n) \equiv n \pmod{2} \) for all \( n \). Therefore, \( f(1986) \equiv 1986 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \), and since \( f(1) = f(1986) \), we have \( f(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \).

Now, let's sum the first 1985 terms of the sequence. We can pair the terms as follows:
\[
(f(1) + f(2)) + (f(3) + f(4)) + \cdots + (f(1985) + f(1986))
\]

Using the recurrence relation, we can express \( f(2) \) in terms of \( f(1) \), \( f(4) \) in terms of \( f(3) \), and so on. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the sequence can be found by summing the first 1985 terms directly.

Notice that the sequence is periodic with a period of 4 in terms of the sum of pairs:
\[
f(1) + f(2) = f(1) + (1 - 2f(1)) = 1 - f(1)
\]
\[
f(3) + f(4) = (-4 + 4f(1)) + (11 - 8f(1)) = 7 - 4f(1)
\]
\[
f(5) + f(6) = (16 - 8f(1)) + (-27 + 16f(1)) = -11 + 8f(1)
\]
\[
f(7) + f(8) = (36 - 16f(1)) + (73 - 32f(1)) = 109 - 48f(1)
\]

The sum of the first 1985 terms is the sum of 496 complete pairs plus the first term:
\[
496 \left( \frac{(1 - f(1)) + (7 - 4f(1)) + (-11 + 8f(1)) + (109 - 48f(1))}{4} \right) + f(1)
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
(1 - f(1)) + (7 - 4f(1)) + (-11 + 8f(1)) + (109 - 48f(1)) = 106 - 53f(1)
\]

Since \( f(1) = f(1986) \) and \( f(1986) \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \), we have \( f(1) = 0 \). Therefore, the sum of the first 1985 terms is:
\[
496 \left( \frac{106}{4} \right) + 0 = 496 \times 26.5 = 13040

Thus, the sum of the first 1985 terms is:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{57}{160}\) into a finite decimal, we can perform long division of 57 by 160. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(57 \div 160\).
2. Since 160 is greater than 57, the integer part of the quotient is 0. So, we write 0. and then a decimal point.
3. Now, we need to divide 57 by 160, which is the same as dividing 57.000000... by 160.
4. 160 goes into 570 three times (since \(160 \times 3 = 480\)). So, we write 3 after the decimal point.
5. Subtract 480 from 570 to get a remainder of 90.
6. Bring down the next 0 to make it 900. Now, we need to divide 900 by 160.
7. 160 goes into 900 five times (since \(160 \times 5 = 800\)). So, we write 5 after the 3.
8. Subtract 800 from 900 to get a remainder of 100.
9. Bring down the next 0 to make it 1000. Now, we need to divide 1000 by 160.
10. 160 goes into 1000 six times (since \(160 \times 6 = 960\)). So, we write 6 after the 5.
11. Subtract 960 from 1000 to get a remainder of 40.
12. Bring down the next 0 to make it 400. Now, we need to divide 400 by 160.
13. 160 goes into 400 two times (since \(160 \times 2 = 320\)). So, we write 2 after the 6.
14. Subtract 320 from 400 to get a remainder of 80.
15. Bring down the next 0 to make it 800. Now, we need to divide 800 by 160.

"To find the area of a right isosceles triangle where the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse is given as \(4\sqrt{2}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the height and the hypotenuse:**
   In a right isosceles triangle, the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the triangle into two smaller right isosceles triangles, each of which is similar to the original triangle. The height \(h\) from the right angle to the hypotenuse can be expressed in terms of the hypotenuse \(c\) as:
   \[
   h = \frac{c}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   This is because the height \(h\) is the altitude of the original right isosceles triangle, and in a right isosceles triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is equal to the hypotenuse divided by \(\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Given the height, solve for the hypotenuse:**
   We are given that the height \(h\) is \(4\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4\sqrt{2} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   To solve for \(c\), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\sqrt{2}\):
   \[
   4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = c
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2 = c
   \]
   So, the hypotenuse \(c\) is:
   \[
   c = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**
   The area \(A\) of a right isosceles triangle can be expressed as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2
   \]
   In a right isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal. Let each leg be \(a\). The relationship between the leg \(a\) and the hypotenuse \(c\) in a right isosceles triangle is:
   \[
   c = a\sqrt{2}
   \]
   We already found that the hypotenuse \(c\) is 8, so:
   \[
   8 = a\sqrt{2}
   \]
   To solve for \(a\), divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):
   \[
   a = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Rationalize the denominator:
   \[
   a = \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Now, substitute \(a = 4\sqrt{2}\) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is positive because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the square root of zero would make the denominator zero, which is also undefined.

The expression inside the square root is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \). We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3). \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ (x-2)(x-3) > 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \), which are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:
- For \( x \in (-\infty, 2) \), choose \( x = 1 \). Then \( (1-2)(1-3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (-\infty, 2) \).
- For \( x \in (2, 3) \), choose \( x = 2.5 \). Then \( (2.5-2)(2.5-3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0 \). So, the inequality does not hold in \( (2, 3) \).
- For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \). Then \( (4-2)(4-3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( (x-2)(x-3) > 0 \) is \( (-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \).

"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the probability of exactly 2 out of \( n \) fair 6-faced dice showing a number other than 1 is \(\frac{25}{216}\), we start by defining the probability of a single die showing a number other than 1. Since a fair 6-faced die has 5 faces that are not 1, the probability of rolling a number other than 1 is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability of rolling a 1 is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

We are interested in the probability that exactly 2 out of \( n \) dice show a number other than 1. This is a binomial probability problem where the number of trials is \( n \), the number of successes (rolling a number other than 1) is 2, the probability of success on each trial is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability of failure (rolling a 1) on each trial is \(\frac{1}{6}\). The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Here, \( k = 2 \), \( p = \frac{5}{6} \), and \( 1-p = \frac{1}{6} \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
P(X = 2) = \binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2}
\]

We know that this probability is equal to \(\frac{25}{216}\), so we can write:

\[
\binom{n}{2} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

First, we simplify the left side of the equation. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2}\) is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{36} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{25}{216}
\]

We can cancel the 25 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{1}{216}
\]

Next, we combine the fractions on the left side:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{72} \cdot \frac{1}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{1}{216}
\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by 72:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{72}{216}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{6^{n-2}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, we multiply both sides by \( 6^{n-2} \):

\[
n(n-1) = \frac{6^{n-2}}{3}
\]

We need to find an integer \( n \) that satisfies this equation. Let's test some values of \( n \):

For \( n = 3 \):

\[
3(3-1) = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{6^{3-2}}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

So, \( n = 3 \) does not satisfy the equation.

For \( n = 4 \):

\[
4(4-1) = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{6^{4-2}}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12

So, \( n = 4 \) satisfies the equation.

3. \(\triangle + \triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond\)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
2\triangle = 5\diamond
\]
This tells us that \(2\triangle\) is a multiple of 5. Since \(\triangle\) is an integer between 1 and 9, the only value that satisfies this condition is \(\triangle = 5\). Substituting \(\triangle = 5\) into the equation, we get:

- The SUV has a fuel efficiency of 15 miles per gallon.
- The total distance traveled is 12,000 miles.
- The amount of gas used by the SUV is:

"To find the integer value of \( x \) in the arithmetic sequence \( 3^2, x, 3^4 \), we start by calculating the values of the given terms. We know that \( 3^2 = 9 \) and \( 3^4 = 81 \). Therefore, the sequence can be written as \( 9, x, 81 \).

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by \( d \). The second term \( x \) can be expressed as \( 9 + d \) and the third term \( 81 \) can be expressed as \( x + d = 9 + 2d \). Since we know the third term is 81, we can set up the following equation:
\[

\]
To find \( d \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
\[

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The rectangle is symmetric about \(O\), and the vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). These perpendicular bisectors are the lines that pass through \(O\) and are equidistant from the corresponding vertex and the center \(O\).

These lines form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the sides of \(ABCD\). The length of each side of this smaller rectangle is half the length of the corresponding side of \(ABCD\).

Since the original rectangle \(ABCD\) has dimensions \(AB = k \cdot AD\), the smaller rectangle has dimensions \(\frac{AB}{2} = \frac{k \cdot AD}{2}\) and \(\frac{AD}{2}\).

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
AB \cdot AD = k \cdot AD \cdot AD = k \cdot AD^2

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\frac{AB}{2} \cdot \frac{AD}{2} = \frac{k \cdot AD}{2} \cdot \frac{AD}{2} = \frac{k \cdot AD^2}{4}
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of the smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of the original rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{k \cdot AD^2}{4}}{k \cdot AD^2} = \frac{1}{4}

"To find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points of tangency of the common tangents to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) and the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\), we first need to determine the equations of the common tangents and then find the points of tangency.

### Step 1: Find the equations of the common tangents
The general equation of a tangent to the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\) is given by:
\[ y = mx + \frac{2}{m} \]
where \(m\) is the slope of the tangent.

Since this tangent is also a tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\), the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle (0,0) to the tangent must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is \(\sqrt{2}\). The perpendicular distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:
\[ \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]
For the tangent \(y = mx + \frac{2}{m}\), we can rewrite it as:
\[ mx - y + \frac{2}{m} = 0 \]
The perpendicular distance from the origin (0,0) to this line is:
\[ \frac{\left| m \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 0 + \frac{2}{m} \right|}{\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \frac{\left| \frac{2}{m} \right|}{\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \frac{2}{|m| \sqrt{m^2 + 1}} \]
Setting this equal to the radius \(\sqrt{2}\), we get:
\[ \frac{2}{|m| \sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \sqrt{2} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ \frac{4}{m^2 (m^2 + 1)} = 2 \]
\[ \frac{2}{m^2 (m^2 + 1)} = 1 \]
\[ 2 = m^2 (m^2 + 1) \]
\[ m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0 \]
Let \(u = m^2\). Then the equation becomes:
\[ u^2 + u - 2 = 0 \]
Factoring, we get:
\[ (u + 2)(u - 1) = 0 \]
So, \(u = -2\) (which is not possible since \(u = m^2 \geq 0\)) or \(u = 1\). Therefore, \(m^2 = 1\) and \(m = \pm 1\).

### Step 2: Find the points of tangency
For \(m = 1\), the tangent is:
\[ y = x + 2 \]
Substituting \(y = x + 2\) into the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\), we get:
\[ (x + 2)^2 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 + 4x + 4 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 0 \]
So, \(x = 2\). Substituting \(x = 2\) back into the tangent equation, we get:
\[ y = 2 + 2 = 4 \]
Thus, the point of tangency is \((2, 4)\).

For \(m = -1\), the tangent is:
\[ y = -x + 2 \]
Substituting \(y = -x + 2\) into the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\), we get:
\[ (-x + 2)^2 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 8x \]
\[ x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \]
Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[ x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 16}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{128}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm 8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6 \pm 4\sqrt{2} \]
So, the points of tangency are \((6 + 4\sqrt{2}, -4 - 4\sqrt{2})\) and \((6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2})\).

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the quadrilateral
The quadrilateral is a kite with vertices \((2, 4)\), \((6 + 4\sqrt{2}, -4 - 4\sqrt{2})\), \((2, -4)\), and \((6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2})\). The diagonals of the kite are the vertical distance between the points \((2, 4)\) and \((2, -4)\), which is \(8\), and the distance between the points \((6 + 4\sqrt{2}, -4 - 4\sqrt{2})\) and \((6 - 4\sqrt{2}, -4 + 4\sqrt{2})\), which is:
\[ \sqrt{(6 + 4\sqrt{2} - (6 - 4\sqrt{2}))^2 + (-4 - 4\sqrt{2} - (-4 + 4\sqrt{2}))^2} = \sqrt{(8\sqrt{2})^2 + (-8\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{128 + 128} = \sqrt{256} = 16 \]
The area \(A\) of a kite is given by:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \]
where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals. Substituting the values, we get:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 16 = 64 \]
Thus, the area of the quadrilateral is:

"To find the number of terms \( n \) in the infinite geometric series \(\left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\}\) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \(\frac{255}{512}\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series. The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) is given by:

\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

For the given series, the first term \( a \) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) and the common ratio \( r \) is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ S_n = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) \]

We are given that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \(\frac{255}{512}\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{255}{512} \]

To eliminate the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{510}{512} = \frac{255}{256} \]

Next, we isolate \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\) by subtracting \(\frac{255}{256}\) from 1:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 1 - \frac{255}{256} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Since \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{256}\) and \(\frac{1}{256} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\), we have:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 \]

Therefore, \( n = 8 \). The number of terms \( n \) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To determine the number of boys participating in the math club, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) be the number of boys and \( G \) be the number of girls in the math club. According to the problem, the total number of students is 35, so we have:
\[ B + G = 35. \]

We are also given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so we can write:
\[ G = 13k \]
for some integer \( k \). Additionally, the number of girls is more than the number of boys, so:
\[ G > B. \]

Substituting \( G = 13k \) into the total number of students equation, we get:
\[ B + 13k = 35. \]
Solving for \( B \), we have:
\[ B = 35 - 13k. \]

Since \( B \) must be a positive integer, \( k \) must be an integer such that \( 1 \leq k < \frac{35}{13} \). Calculating the upper bound, we find:
\[ \frac{35}{13} \approx 2.6923, \]
so \( k \) can be 1 or 2.

We now check each value of \( k \):
1. If \( k = 1 \), then \( G = 13 \times 1 = 13 \) and \( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \). Here, \( G < B \), which does not satisfy the condition \( G > B \).
2. If \( k = 2 \), then \( G = 13 \times 2 = 26 \) and \( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \). Here, \( G > B \), which satisfies the condition \( G > B \).

"To find the modular inverse of \(17\) modulo \(83\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[17x = 83k + 1\]

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find such \(x\) and \(k\).

First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(17\) and \(83\):

\[83 = 4 \cdot 17 + 15\]
\[17 = 1 \cdot 15 + 2\]
\[15 = 7 \cdot 2 + 1\]
\[2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(17\) and \(83\) are coprime, and an inverse exists.

Next, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(17\) and \(83\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 2\]

Substitute \(2\) from the previous equation \(2 = 17 - 1 \cdot 15\):

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot (17 - 1 \cdot 15)\]
\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 17 + 7 \cdot 15\]
\[1 = 15 + 7 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]

Substitute \(15\) from the first equation \(15 = 83 - 4 \cdot 17\):

\[1 = 8 \cdot (83 - 4 \cdot 17) - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 32 \cdot 17 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

Thus, we have:

\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

This equation shows that:

\[-39 \cdot 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

Since \(-39\) is not in the range \(0\) to \(82\), we convert it to a positive equivalent by adding \(83\):

\[-39 + 83 = 44\]

"To solve the congruence \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\), we first need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 14 and 100. The gcd of 14 and 100 is 2. Since 2 divides 46, the congruence has solutions.

We start by simplifying the congruence by dividing all terms by 2:
\[
\frac{14u}{2} \equiv \frac{46}{2} \pmod{\frac{100}{2}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}
\]

Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is a number \(x\) such that:
\[
7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of 7 and 50:
\[
50 = 7 \cdot 7 + 1
\]
\[
7 = 7 \cdot 1 + 0
\]
The gcd is 1, and since it is 1, 7 and 50 are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express 1 as a combination of 7 and 50:
\[
1 = 50 - 7 \cdot 7
\]
This equation tells us that \(x = -7\) is a solution to \(7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\). However, we want a positive inverse, so we add 50 to \(-7\):
\[
-7 + 50 = 43
\]
Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is 43.

Now, we multiply both sides of the congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\) by 43:
\[
43 \cdot 7u \equiv 43 \cdot 23 \pmod{50}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
u \equiv 989 \pmod{50}
\]
We reduce 989 modulo 50:
\[
989 \div 50 = 19.78 \quad \text{(integer part is 19)}
\]
\[
989 - 19 \cdot 50 = 989 - 950 = 39

So, we have:

First, we set up a proportion based on the scale. The scale can be written as:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ inches}}{10 \text{ miles}} \]

We want to find the number of inches, \( x \), that correspond to 53.25 miles. We can set up the following proportion:

This simplifies to:
\[ 159.75 = 10x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

\[a + b = 13\]

The number obtained by reversing the digits is \(10b + a\). The difference between the original number and the reversed number is given as 27, so we have:

\[(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

Dividing both sides by 9, we obtain:

First, let's find the total number of students in both 7-year and 8-year classes:

Next, we calculate the proportion of the total student population that is made up of 8-year students:
\[
\text{Proportion of 8-year students} = \frac{650}{1170}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 650 and 1170. The GCD of 650 and 1170 is 130. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 130:
\[
\frac{650 \div 130}{1170 \div 130} = \frac{5}{9}

So, the proportion of the total student population that is made up of 8-year students is \(\frac{5}{9}\).

Since there are 18 representatives in total, the number of representatives that should be allocated to the 8-year students is:

"To find the image of the line \( y = 2x + 1 \) under the transformation defined by the matrix \( \mathbf{M} \), we first need to determine the matrix \( \mathbf{M} \). The matrix \( \mathbf{M} \) transforms the vectors \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \) to \( \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \) to \( \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

We solve these systems of equations step by step. First, solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
2a - b = 9 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
a - 3b = 7 \quad \text{(2)}

Multiply equation (2) by 2:

Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
\[

Substitute \( b = -1 \) back into equation (1):
\[
2a - (-1) = 9 \implies 2a + 1 = 9 \implies 2a = 8 \implies a = 4

So, \( a = 4 \) and \( b = -1 \). Now solve for \( c \) and \( d \):

\[
c - 3d = -1 \quad \text{(5)}

Subtract equation (4) from equation (6):
\[
(2c - 6d) - (2c - d) = -2 - 3 \implies -5d = -5 \implies d = 1
\]

Substitute \( d = 1 \) back into equation (4):
\[
2c - 1 = 3 \implies 2c = 4 \implies c = 2
\]

So, \( c = 2 \) and \( d = 1 \). Therefore, the matrix \( \mathbf{M} \) is:
\[

"To find the integer solutions of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (here, \(-14\)) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (here, \(1\)).

Since the leading coefficient is \(1\), \( q \) must be \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-14\), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14 \).

We will test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial and checking if the result is zero.

1. Test \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   1^4 + 5 \cdot 1^3 + 9 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 1 \) is a root.

2. Since \( x = 1 \) is a root, we can factor \( x - 1 \) out of the polynomial. We can use synthetic division to divide \( x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 \) by \( x - 1 \).

   \[
   \begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
     1 & 1 & 5 & 9 & -1 & -14 \\
       &   & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
     \hline
       & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 & 0 \\
   \end{array}
   \]
   The quotient is \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \). So, we have:
   \[
   x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14)
   \]

3. Next, we need to find the integer roots of the cubic polynomial \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \). Again, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14 \).

4. Test \( x = -1 \):
   \[
   (-1)^3 + 6 \cdot (-1)^2 + 15 \cdot (-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 - 15 + 14 = 4 \neq 0
   \]
   So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root.

5. Test \( x = -2 \):
   \[
   (-2)^3 + 6 \cdot (-2)^2 + 15 \cdot (-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = -2 \) is a root.

6. Since \( x = -2 \) is a root, we can factor \( x + 2 \) out of the cubic polynomial. We can use synthetic division to divide \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \) by \( x + 2 \).

   \[
   \begin{array}{r|rrrr}
     -2 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
        &   & -2 & -8 & -14 \\
     \hline
        & 1 & 4 & 7 & 0 \\
   \end{array}
   \]
   The quotient is \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \). So, we have:
   \[
   x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)
   \]

7. Therefore, the original polynomial can be factored as:
   \[
   x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)
   \]

8. Finally, we need to check if \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) has any real roots. The discriminant of \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) is:
   \[
   4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7 = 16 - 28 = -12
   \]
   Since the discriminant is negative, \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) has no real roots.

Therefore, the integer solutions to the equation \( x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \).

"To determine the number of students who attended the art class this week, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the constraints:**
   - There are 30 to 50 students in total.
   - Traditionally, students are divided into groups of the same size.
   - This week, vector and vectoria cannot divide the students into groups of the same size.

2. **Analyze the constraints:**
   - If vector and vectoria cannot divide the students into groups of the same size, then the number of students must not be a perfect square (since a perfect square can be divided into groups of the same size).
   - Additionally, the number of students must be between 30 and 50.

3. **List the perfect squares between 30 and 50:**
   - The perfect squares in this range are \(6^2 = 36\) and \(7^2 = 49\).

4. **Determine the number of students:**
   - Since the number of students cannot be a perfect square, the number of students must be any number between 30 and 50 except 36 and 49.
   - The problem does not provide any additional constraints to further narrow down the number of students, so we can conclude that the number of students is any number in the range 30 to 50 except 36 and 49.

However, the problem asks for a specific number of students, and since the constraints do not provide a unique solution, we can assume that the problem is designed to have a unique answer based on the context. Given the constraints and the typical nature of such problems, the most logical and consistent answer is the number of students that is not a perfect square and falls within the range.

"To determine the cost of constructing a 3-inch cube of gold, we need to consider the costs of the gold and the gold coating separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the volume of the gold cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[ V = s^3 \]
For a 3-inch cube, the volume is:
\[ V = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the gold. The cost of gold is proportional to its volume. We know the cost of constructing a 1-inch cube is \$1.30, so the cost per cubic inch of gold is \$1.30. Therefore, the cost of 27 cubic inches of gold is:
\[ \text{Cost of gold} = 27 \times 1.30 = 35.10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the gold coating. The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[ A = 6s^2 \]
For a 3-inch cube, the surface area is:
\[ A = 6 \times 3^2 = 6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ square inches} \]

We know the cost of the gold coating is proportional to the surface area. We can find the cost per square inch of the gold coating by using the cost of constructing a 2-inch cube. The volume of a 2-inch cube is:
\[ V = 2^3 = 8 \text{ cubic inches} \]
The cost of 8 cubic inches of gold is:
\[ \text{Cost of gold} = 8 \times 1.30 = 10.40 \text{ dollars} \]
The cost per cubic inch of gold is:
\[ \text{Cost per cubic inch} = \frac{10.40}{8} = 1.30 \text{ dollars per cubic inch} \]
The cost per cubic inch of gold is \$1.30, so the cost per cubic inch of gold is:
\[ \text{Cost per cubic inch} = \frac{10.40}{8} = 1.30 \text{ dollars per cubic inch} \]
The cost of 27 cubic inches of gold is:
\[ \text{Cost of gold} = 27 \times 1.30 = 35.10 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the gold coating is:
\[ \text{Cost of gold coating} = 54 \times 0.50 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total cost of constructing a 3-inch cube of gold is the sum of the cost of the gold and the cost of the gold coating:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 35.10 + 27 = 62.10 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find the measure of \(\angle STR\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram. We know that \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), \(\angle P = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\).

First, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle PRQ\). Since \(\angle P\) and \(\angle PRQ\) are supplementary (they form a straight line), we have:
\[
\angle PRQ = 180^\circ - \angle P = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ.

Next, we use the fact that \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\). This means that \(\angle STR\) is an alternate interior angle to \(\angle PRQ\). Therefore, \(\angle STR\) is equal to \(\angle PRQ\):
\[
\angle STR = \angle PRQ = 140^\circ.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) is undefined, we need to identify the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. The expression is undefined at any point where the denominator is zero because division by zero is not defined in mathematics.

The denominator of the expression is \( x^2 - 9 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 9 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.

First, we recognize that \( x^2 - 9 \) is a difference of squares. The difference of squares formula is \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). Here, \( a = x \) and \( b = 3 \), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3) \]

Next, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

\[ x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3 \]

Therefore, the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \). This means the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) is undefined at \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \).

"To solve the given system of equations:

1. \(\log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = 2\)
2. \(\log_y 5x = 2\)

we will proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first equation
The first equation can be simplified using the properties of logarithms. Specifically, the property \(\log_b a + \log_b c = \log_b (ac)\) allows us to combine the logarithms:

\[
\log_6 ((x-y)(x+y)) = 2
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2
\]

### Step 2: Remove the logarithm
To remove the logarithm, we rewrite the equation in its exponential form. Recall that \(\log_b a = c\) implies \(b^c = a\):

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 6^2
\]

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 36
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the second equation
The second equation is:

\[
\log_y 5x = 2
\]

Rewriting this in its exponential form gives:

\[
y^2 = 5x
\]

### Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We now have a system of two equations:

1. \(x^2 - y^2 = 36\)
2. \(y^2 = 5x\)

Substitute \(y^2 = 5x\) into the first equation:

\[
x^2 - 5x = 36
\]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0
\]

### Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation
We solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -36\):

\[
x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-36)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 144}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm 13}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{5 + 13}{2} = 9
\]
\[
x = \frac{5 - 13}{2} = -4
\]

### Step 6: Check the solutions
We need to check which of these solutions are valid by ensuring they satisfy both original equations.

1. For \(x = 9\):
   - Substitute \(x = 9\) into \(y^2 = 5x\):
     \[
     y^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
     \]
     \[
     y = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
     \]
   - Check the first equation:
     \[
     \log_6 (9 - 3\sqrt{5}) + \log_6 (9 + 3\sqrt{5}) = 2
     \]
     This is valid because both \(9 - 3\sqrt{5}\) and \(9 + 3\sqrt{5}\) are positive.

2. For \(x = -4\):
   - Substitute \(x = -4\) into \(y^2 = 5x\):
     \[
     y^2 = 5 \cdot (-4) = -20
     \]
     This is not valid because \(y^2\) cannot be negative.

### Conclusion
The only valid solution is \(x = 9\).

"To determine the positive integer whose positive divisors are exactly three, we need to consider the properties of such numbers. A number with exactly three positive divisors must be the square of a prime number. This is because the divisors of \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is a prime number) are \( 1, p, \) and \( p^2 \).

Let's list the smallest squares of prime numbers in ascending order:

\sum_{k=0}^{8} (-1)^k z^k
\]

This is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and the common ratio \(r = -z\). The sum of the first \(n+1\) terms of a geometric series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{a(1 - r^{n+1})}{1 - r}
\]

For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = -z\), and \(n = 8\), so the sum is:

\[
S = \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 - (-z)} = \frac{1 + z^9}{1 + z}

Setting this equal to zero, we get:

\frac{1 + z^9}{1 + z} = 0

This equation is satisfied if and only if the numerator is zero (and the denominator is not zero):

\[
\theta_k = \frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{2k\pi}{9} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8

To find the sum of these \(\theta\) values, we sum the arithmetic sequence:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{8} \left(\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{2k\pi}{9}\right) = \sum_{k=0}^{8} \frac{\pi}{9} + \sum_{k=0}^{8} \frac{2k\pi}{9} = \frac{\pi}{9} \sum_{k=0}^{8} 1 + \frac{2\pi}{9} \sum_{k=0}^{8} k

The sum of the first 9 positive integers is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{8} 1 = 9
\]

The sum of the first 8 positive integers is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{8} k = \frac{8(8+1)}{2} = 36

Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
\frac{\pi}{9} \cdot 9 + \frac{2\pi}{9} \cdot 36 = \pi + 8\pi = 9\pi

1. Determine the value of \(\sqrt{20}\).
2. Apply the ceiling function to \(\sqrt{20}\).

"To find the maximum value of the expression \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) given that \( a + b + c + d = 10 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
\]

with equality if and only if \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n \).

We can rewrite the expression \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) in a form that allows us to apply the AM-GM inequality. Consider the terms \( a, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d, d \). The sum of these terms is

\[
a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d = a + 2b + 3c + 4d
\]

We need to adjust this sum to match the given condition \( a + b + c + d = 10 \). To do this, we can multiply the entire sum by a constant factor. Let's multiply by 10:

\[
10(a + b + c + d) = 10a + 10b + 10c + 10d
\]

Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \( 10a, 10b, 10b, 10c, 10c, 10c, 10d, 10d, 10d, 10d \):

\[
\frac{10a + 10b + 10b + 10c + 10c + 10c + 10d + 10d + 10d + 10d}{10} \geq \sqrt[10]{(10a)(10b)^2 (10c)^3 (10d)^4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get

\[
\frac{10(a + b + c + d)}{10} = a + b + c + d = 10
\]

So the inequality becomes

\[
10 \geq \sqrt[10]{10^{10} ab^2 c^3 d^4}
\]

Raising both sides to the 10th power, we get

\[
10^{10} \geq 10^{10} ab^2 c^3 d^4
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 10^{10} \), we get

\[
1 \geq ab^2 c^3 d^4
\]

The maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) is 1, and this maximum value is achieved when \( 10a = 10b = 10c = 10d \), or \( a = b = c = d = 1 \).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",27648,"[27648, '27648']",False

"To determine the distance traveled by a car moving at a speed of 50 miles per hour for \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours, we can use the formula for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we need to convert the time \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours into an improper fraction. The number \(2\frac{3}{4}\) can be written as:

\[ 2\frac{3}{4} = 2 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{4} \]

Now, we can substitute the speed and the time into the distance formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour} \times \frac{11}{4} \, \text{hours} \]

To multiply these, we can write:

\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \times \frac{11}{4} = \frac{50 \times 11}{4} = \frac{550}{4} = \frac{275}{2} \]

Next, we convert the improper fraction \(\frac{275}{2}\) into a mixed number. We do this by dividing 275 by 2:

\[ 275 \div 2 = 137 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

So, \(\frac{275}{2}\) can be written as:

"To determine the value of \( n \) for the given magic square, we need to verify that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The given magic square is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 & n+2 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 & 3 \\
\hline
1 & n-1 & 2 & n \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 + n + 2 = 3n + 3
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + 2 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 + 2 = 3n - 4
\]

Since the square is a magic square, the sums of the numbers in each row must be equal. Therefore, we set the sums equal to each other:
\[
3n + 3 = 3n - 4
\]

Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
3 = -4
\]

This equation is clearly false, which means there must be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the possibility that the square might not be a standard magic square but a modified one where the sums are equal in a different way.

Given the structure of the square, let's assume the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is \( S \). We can use the sum of the numbers in the first row to express \( S \):
\[
S = 3n + 3
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n + (n-1) = 3 + 2n - 9 + n + n - 1 = 4n - 7
\]

Since the sum of the second column must also be \( S \), we set the sums equal to each other:
\[
4n - 7 = 3n + 3
\]

Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
n - 7 = 3
\]

Adding 7 to both sides, we get:
\[
n = 10
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 10 \) back into the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
7 & 3 & 11 & 12 \\
\hline
12 & 11 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
2 & 10 & 9 & 3 \\
\hline
1 & 9 & 2 & 10 \\
\hline

\]

We check the sum of each row:
\[
7 + 3 + 11 + 12 = 33

\[

\]
\[
2 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 24
\]
\[

"To find the value of the expression \(\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8}\), we can use the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula states that \(\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}\). We will use the natural logarithm (base \(e\)) for convenience.

Applying the change of base formula to each term in the expression, we get:
\[
\log_2{3} = \frac{\ln{3}}{\ln{2}}, \quad \log_3{4} = \frac{\ln{4}}{\ln{3}}, \quad \log_4{5} = \frac{\ln{5}}{\ln{4}}, \quad \log_5{6} = \frac{\ln{6}}{\ln{5}}, \quad \log_6{7} = \frac{\ln{7}}{\ln{6}}, \quad \log_7{8} = \frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{7}}
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we have:
\[
\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8} = \left(\frac{\ln{3}}{\ln{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{4}}{\ln{3}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{5}}{\ln{4}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{6}}{\ln{5}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{7}}{\ln{6}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{7}}\right)
\]

Notice that this is a telescoping product, where most terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel out:
\[
\left(\frac{\ln{3}}{\ln{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{4}}{\ln{3}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{5}}{\ln{4}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{6}}{\ln{5}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{7}}{\ln{6}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{7}}\right) = \frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{2}}
\]

Using the change of base formula again, we know that \(\frac{\ln{8}}{\ln{2}} = \log_2{8}\). Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:
\[
\log_2{8} = \log_2{(2^3)} = 3

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of two rolled dice is 7, given the specific conditions of the dice. Let's denote the probability that face \( F \) appears as \( p \) and the probability that the opposite face appears as \( q \). Since the sum of the probabilities for all faces and their opposites must equal 1, we have:

\[ p + q + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 \]
\[ p + q + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \]
\[ p + q = \frac{1}{2} \]

We are given that the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of two dice is 7 is \( \frac{47}{288} \). We need to consider all possible pairs of faces that can sum to 7. These pairs are: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1).

Let's denote the probability that face \( i \) appears as \( P(i) \). Then, the probability that the sum is 7 is the sum of the probabilities of each pair:

\[ P(1)P(6) + P(2)P(5) + P(3)P(4) + P(4)P(3) + P(5)P(2) + P(6)P(1) \]

Given the conditions, we can express \( P(6) \), \( P(5) \), and \( P(4) \) in terms of \( p \) and \( q \):

\[ P(6) = q, \quad P(5) = q, \quad P(4) = q \]
\[ P(1) = p, \quad P(2) = p, \quad P(3) = p \]

Substituting these into the sum, we get:

\[ p^2 q + p^2 q + p^2 q + p^2 q + p^2 q + q^2 p = 6p^2 q + pq^2 = pq(6p + q) \]

We know that \( q = \frac{1}{2} - p \), so substituting this in, we get:

\[ pq(6p + \frac{1}{2} - p) = pq(5p + \frac{1}{2}) \]

We are given that this probability is \( \frac{47}{288} \), so:

\[ pq(5p + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{47}{288} \]

Since \( p + q = \frac{1}{2} \), we can express \( q \) as \( q = \frac{1}{2} - p \). Substituting this in, we get:

\[ p \left( \frac{1}{2} - p \right) \left( 5p + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{47}{288} \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ p \left( \frac{5p}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - 5p^2 - \frac{p}{2} \right) = \frac{47}{288} \]
\[ p \left( \frac{1}{4} - 5p^2 \right) = \frac{47}{288} \]
\[ \frac{p}{4} - 5p^3 = \frac{47}{288} \]
\[ 72p - 1440p^3 = 47 \]
\[ 1440p^3 - 72p + 47 = 0 \]

We need to find the rational roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of 47 divided by the factors of 1440. Testing these, we find that \( p = \frac{1}{3} \) is a root:

\[ 1440 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 - 72 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + 47 = 1440 \cdot \frac{1}{27} - 24 + 47 = \frac{160}{3} - 24 + 47 = \frac{160}{3} - \frac{72}{3} + \frac{141}{3} = \frac{229}{3} - \frac{72}{3} = \frac{157}{3} = 0 \]

Thus, \( p = \frac{1}{3} \) is a root. Therefore, the probability that face \( F \) appears is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability that the opposite face appears is \( q = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} \).

The sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( p \) is:

"To determine how much fartherジム歩aks compared toマーサ, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance thatジム travels. Sinceジム walks along the diagonal of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the rectangle).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Substituting the given values for the length and the width:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, the distance thatジム travels is 500 feet.

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{ma}} = \text{length} + \text{width} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}

So, the distance thatマーサ travels is 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled byマーサ andジム:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{ma}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{ジ}} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}

\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010\sqrt{y} - 4.

The numerator is a polynomial in \(y\), but it is quite complex. Instead, we will analyze the behavior of the equation and look for possible solutions. Notice that the right-hand side, \(2010\sqrt{y} - 4\), is a function that is increasing for \(y \geq 0\).

First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.

\]
Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Therefore, the odd integer must be of the form \(2^a \times 5^b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative integers. This means the odd integer must be a product of only the primes 2 and 5, but since it is odd, it must be a product of only the prime 5. Hence, the odd integer must be of the form \(5^b\).

Next, we need to find all positive odd integers less than 2010 that are of the form \(5^b\). We do this by calculating the powers of 5 until the result is less than 2010:
\[
5^0 = 1, \quad 5^1 = 5, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad 5^3 = 125, \quad 5^4 = 625, \quad 5^5 = 3125
\]
Since \(5^5 = 3125\) is greater than 2010, the largest power of 5 less than 2010 is \(5^4 = 625\). Therefore, the positive odd integers less than 2010 that are of the form \(5^b\) are \(5^0, 5^1, 5^2, 5^3,\) and \(5^4\). There are 5 such integers.

The total number of positive odd integers less than 2010 is the number of odd integers in the arithmetic sequence from 1 to 2009. The number of terms in this sequence is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2009}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1005
\]
Thus, the probability that a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 is of the form \(5^b\) is:
\[
\frac{5}{1005} = \frac{1}{201}
\]
Since 1 and 201 are coprime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 201\), and the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
1 + 201 = 202
\]

"To find \(\tan A\) for the triangle \(ABC\) given that the area of the triangle is equal to \(a^2 - (b - c)^2\), we start by expressing the area of the triangle in two different ways.

First, the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed using the formula:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A
\]

Second, we are given that the area is also equal to \(a^2 - (b - c)^2\). Expanding this expression, we get:
\[
a^2 - (b - c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2
\]

Using the Law of Cosines, we know that:
\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
\]
Substituting this into the expression for the area, we get:
\[
a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = 2bc - 2bc \cos A = 2bc(1 - \cos A)
\]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = 2bc(1 - \cos A)
\]
Since \(bc \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(bc\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin A = 2(1 - \cos A)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
\sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)
\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\) to express \(\sin A\) in terms of \(\cos A\). Substituting \(\sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)\) into the identity, we get:
\[
[4(1 - \cos A)]^2 + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
16(1 - 2\cos A + \cos^2 A) + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
\[
16 - 32\cos A + 16\cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
\[
17\cos^2 A - 32\cos A + 15 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(\cos A = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 17\), \(b = -32\), and \(c = 15\):
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15}}{2 \cdot 17} = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34} = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{4}}{34} = \frac{32 \pm 2}{34}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
\cos A = \frac{34}{34} = 1 \quad \text{(not possible for a triangle)} \quad \text{or} \quad \cos A = \frac{30}{34} = \frac{15}{17}
\]

Since \(\cos A = 1\) is not possible for a triangle, we have \(\cos A = \frac{15}{17}\). Now, we find \(\sin A\) using \(\sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)\):
\[
\sin A = 4\left(1 - \frac{15}{17}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{17} = \frac{8}{17}
\]

Finally, we find \(\tan A\) using the identity \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\):
\[
\tan A = \frac{\frac{8}{17}}{\frac{15}{17}} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}} = 6\), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's denote \(y = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}}\). According to the problem, we have \(y = 6\).

Next, we will square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
\left(\sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}}\right)^2 = 6^2.
\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[
x + \sqrt{3x + 6} + 2\sqrt{(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6})} + x - \sqrt{3x + 6} = 36.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
2x + 2\sqrt{(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6})} = 36.
\]
Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6}) = x^2 - (\sqrt{3x + 6})^2 = x^2 - (3x + 6) = x^2 - 3x - 6.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
2x + 2\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 36.
\]
We can simplify this by dividing every term by 2:
\[
x + \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18.
\]
Next, we isolate the square root term:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18 - x.
\]
We then square both sides again to eliminate the square root:
\[
x^2 - 3x - 6 = (18 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding the right side, we get:
\[
x^2 - 3x - 6 = 324 - 36x + x^2.
\]
We can simplify this by subtracting \(x^2\) from both sides:
\[
-3x - 6 = 324 - 36x.
\]
Next, we add \(36x\) to both sides:
\[
33x - 6 = 324.
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
33x = 330.
\]
Finally, we divide both sides by 33:
\[
x = 10.
\]
To ensure that this solution is valid, we substitute \(x = 10\) back into the original equation:
\[
\sqrt{10 + \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} = \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{30 + 6}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{30 + 6}} = \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{36}} = \sqrt{10 + 6} + \sqrt{10 - 6} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{4} = 4 + 2 = 6.

Since the left side equals the right side, our solution is correct. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:

- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)

We will evaluate the distances for the following permutations:

"To determine the volume of the cube, we need to first find the length of the edge of the cube. The problem states that a steel sphere with a radius of 3 inches is removed from the corner of a cube. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube because the sphere is inscribed in the cube (i.e., it touches all six faces of the cube).

The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so:
\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ inches}

Therefore, the edge length of the cube is 6 inches.

The volume \( V \) of a cube with edge length \( s \) is given by the formula:
\[
V = s^3

"To find the original price of the shoes, we need to understand that the sale price of $14.40 represents 40% of the original price. This is because the shoes were sold at a 60% discount, meaning the customer paid 100% - 60% = 40% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price by \( x \). According to the problem, 40% of the original price is equal to the sale price of $14.40. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 0.4x = 14.40 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:
\[ x = \frac{14.40}{0.4} \]

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15| \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function within this interval. The function \( f(x) \) is a sum of absolute value functions, and the minimum value of such a function often occurs at a critical point or at the endpoints of the interval.

First, let's consider the critical points of \( f(x) \). The critical points are the values of \( x \) where the expression inside each absolute value changes sign. These points are \( x = p \), \( x = 15 \), and \( x = p + 15 \). However, since \( p + 15 \) is outside the interval \( [p, 15] \), we only need to consider \( x = p \) and \( x = 15 \).

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval.

1. Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = p \):
   \[
   f(p) = |p-p| + |p-15| + |p-p-15| = 0 + (15-p) + 15 = 30 - p

Since \( 0 < p < 15 \), we have \( 30 - p > 15 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) in the interval \( [p, 15] \) is \( 15 \).

Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \) is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",15,"[15, '15']",True

First, let's consider the possible values for \( r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \). Since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, the roots must be integers. We can start by considering the smallest possible absolute values for the roots.

If we take \( n = 2 \), the roots could be \( r_1 = 1 \) and \( r_2 = -1 \). Then:

"To determine the area of the region \( S \) in the \((a, b)\)-plane where the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) has at least one real root, we start by analyzing the polynomial and its properties.

First, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 \). If \( r \) is a real root of \( P(x) \), then \( P(r) = 0 \). We can rewrite \( P(x) \) as:
\[ P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1. \]

To find the conditions on \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( P(x) \) has a real root, we can use the fact that the polynomial is symmetric. Let's substitute \( x = \frac{1}{x} \) into \( P(x) \):

Thus, \( P\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 0 \) if and only if \( P(x) = 0 \). This means that if \( r \) is a root, then \( \frac{1}{r} \) is also a root.

Now, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \):
\[ P(1) = 1 + a - b + a + 1 = 2 + 2a - b, \]
\[ P(-1) = 1 - a - b - a + 1 = 2 - 2a - b. \]

For \( P(x) \) to have a real root, at least one of \( P(1) \) or \( P(-1) \) must be non-positive. Therefore, we need:
\[ 2 + 2a - b \le 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2 - 2a - b \le 0. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ b \ge 2 + 2a \quad \text{or} \quad b \le 2 - 2a. \]

Since \( 0 \le a \le 1 \) and \( 0 \le b \le 1 \), the inequality \( b \ge 2 + 2a \) is not possible because \( 2 + 2a > 1 \) for \( 0 \le a \le 1 \). Therefore, the only valid inequality is:
\[ b \le 2 - 2a. \]

This inequality describes a region below the line \( b = 2 - 2a \) in the \((a, b)\)-plane. The line \( b = 2 - 2a \) intersects the line \( b = 1 \) at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and the line \( a = 0 \) at \( b = 2 \), but since \( b \le 1 \), the intersection point is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right) \). Similarly, the line \( b = 2 - 2a \) intersects the line \( a = 1 \) at \( b = 0 \).

Thus, the region \( S \) is a right triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((\frac{1}{2}, 1)\), and \((1, 0)\). The area of this triangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(1 - 0\right) \times \left(1 - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{4}. \]

Therefore, the area of the region \( S \) is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the function is defined and does not lead to any undefined mathematical operations, such as division by zero or taking the logarithm of a non-positive number.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the constraints from the denominator:**
   The denominator of the function is \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \). For the logarithm to be defined, the argument inside the logarithm must be positive:
   \[
   2 - \log(x-2) > 0
   \]
   Solving this inequality:
   \[
   2 > \log(x-2)
   \]
   Converting this to exponential form (base 10):
   \[
   10^2 > x-2
   \]
   \[
   100 > x-2
   \]
   \[
   102 > x
   \]
   \[
   x < 102
   \]

2. **Identify the constraints from the argument of the inner logarithm:**
   The inner logarithm is \( \log(x-2) \). For the logarithm to be defined, the argument inside the logarithm must be positive:
   \[
   x-2 > 0
   \]
   Solving this inequality:
   \[
   x > 2
   \]

3. **Combine the constraints:**
   From the two inequalities, we have:
   \[
   2 < x < 102
   \]

4. **Check for any additional constraints from the numerator:**
   The numerator of the function is \( 2 - x \). This expression is defined for all \( x \) in the interval \( (2, 102) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \) is:

"To find the magnitude \( |w| \) of the complex number \( w = \frac{3z+1}{5z+7} \) where \( z = 1+i \), we will follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( z = 1+i \) into the expression for \( w \).
2. Simplify the expression to get \( w \) in the form \( a+bi \).
3. Calculate the magnitude \( |w| \) using the formula \( |a+bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

Let's start with the first step:

1. Substitute \( z = 1+i \) into the expression for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{3(1+i) + 1}{5(1+i) + 7}
   \]

2. Simplify the numerator and the denominator separately:
   \[
   \text{Numerator: } 3(1+i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator: } 5(1+i) + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   w = \frac{4+3i}{12+5i}
   \]

3. To simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is \( 12-5i \):
   \[
   w = \frac{(4+3i)(12-5i)}{(12+5i)(12-5i)}
   \]

4. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   (12+5i)(12-5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169
   \]

5. Calculate the numerator:
   \[
   (4+3i)(12-5i) = 4 \cdot 12 + 4 \cdot (-5i) + 3i \cdot 12 + 3i \cdot (-5i) = 48 - 20i + 36i - 15i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   48 - 20i + 36i - 15(-1) = 48 - 20i + 36i + 15 = 63 + 16i
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   w = \frac{63 + 16i}{169} = \frac{63}{169} + \frac{16}{169}i
   \]

6. Now, we calculate the magnitude \( |w| \):
   \[
   |w| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{63}{169} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{16}{169} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{63^2}{169^2} + \frac{16^2}{169^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{63^2 + 16^2}{169^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{63^2 + 16^2}}{169}
   \]
   Calculate \( 63^2 \) and \( 16^2 \):
   \[
   63^2 = 3969 \quad \text{and} \quad 16^2 = 256
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   |w| = \frac{\sqrt{3969 + 256}}{169} = \frac{\sqrt{4225}}{169} = \frac{65}{169} = \frac{5}{13}
   \]

Therefore, the magnitude \( |w| \) is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{13}}\).","[5/13, '\\frac{5}{13}']",\frac{5}{13},"[5/13, '\\frac{5}{13}']",True
"To find the area of the given eight-sided polygon (octagon) with alternating side lengths of 1 and \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and ensuring that no two adjacent sides have the same length, we can break the octagon into simpler shapes, specifically squares and right triangles.

First, let's visualize the octagon. We can divide it into four squares and four right triangles. Each square has a side length of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and each right triangle has legs of length \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

The area of one square is:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since there are four squares, the total area of the squares is:
\[
4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2
\]

Next, we consider the right triangles. Each right triangle has legs of length \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), so the area of one right triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the right triangles is:
\[
4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]

Adding the areas of the squares and the right triangles gives us the total area of the octagon:
\[
2 + 1 = 3
\]

Therefore, the area of the octagon is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given recurrence relation and the condition \(a_3 = a_1\). The recurrence relation is:
\[a_{i+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}.\]

First, let's express \(a_2\) in terms of \(a_1\):
\[a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1}.\]

Next, we express \(a_3\) in terms of \(a_2\):
\[a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1} = 1 - \frac{1}{a_1}.\]

We are given that \(a_3 = a_1\), so we can set up the equation:
\[1 - \frac{1}{a_1} = a_1.\]

To solve for \(a_1\), we multiply both sides by \(a_1\):
\[a_1 - 1 = a_1^2.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = 1\):
\[a_1 = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]

Thus, the solutions are:
\[a_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad a_1 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]

We will use the fact that \(a_1\) is a root of the equation \(a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0\). To find the period of the sequence, we compute the next few terms:
\[a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{2}{1 - i\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{1 + i\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{1 + 3} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{4} = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = a_1.\]

Similarly,
\[a_3 = a_1,\]
\[a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = a_2 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},\]
\[a_5 = a_1,\]
\[a_6 = a_2 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},\]
and so on. We observe that the sequence is periodic with a period of 2. Therefore, \(a_9 = a_1\).

We need to find \((a_9)^9\):
\[(a_9)^9 = a_1^9.\]

Since \(a_1\) is a root of the equation \(a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0\), we can use the fact that \(a_1^2 = a_1 - 1\). We compute \(a_1^3\):
\[a_1^3 = a_1 \cdot a_1^2 = a_1(a_1 - 1) = a_1^2 - a_1 = (a_1 - 1) - a_1 = -1.\]

Thus,
\[a_1^9 = (a_1^3)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\]

"To find the measure of \(\angle AHB\) in \(\triangle ABC\) where the heights \(\overline{AD}\) and \(\overline{BE}\) intersect at \(H\), we start by determining the measure of \(\angle ACB\). Given that \(\angle BAC = 54^\circ\) and \(\angle ABC = 52^\circ\), we can find \(\angle ACB\) as follows:

\[
\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 54^\circ - 52^\circ = 74^\circ.
\]

The point \(H\) where the altitudes intersect is the orthocenter of \(\triangle ABC\). A key property of the orthocenter is that the measure of \(\angle AHB\) is related to the measure of \(\angle ACB\) by the formula:

\[
\angle AHB = 180^\circ - \angle ACB.
\]

Substituting the value of \(\angle ACB\) that we found:
