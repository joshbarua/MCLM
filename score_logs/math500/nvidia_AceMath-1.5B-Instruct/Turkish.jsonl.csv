"To convert the Cartesian coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the radius \(r\)**:
   The radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to the point \((0, 3)\). We use the formula for the distance in the Cartesian plane:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate the angle \(\theta\)**:
   The angle \(\theta\) is the angle formed with the positive x-axis. We use the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
   \]
   Since \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive y-axis. Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

3. **Combine the results**:
   Now we have \(r = 3\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Thus, the polar coordinates are:
   \[
   (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2})
   \]

Finally, we present the answer in the required format:

"To find the value of the double sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), we start by interchanging the order of summation. The double sum can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Here, \(n = j + k\) and for each fixed \(n\), \(j\) ranges from 1 to \(n-1\). Therefore, the inner sum \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1\) simply counts the number of terms, which is \(n-1\). Thus, the double sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3}
\]

We can split this sum into two separate sums:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n}{n^3} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

We can express these sums in terms of \(p\) and \(q\):

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1
\]
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1
\]

Therefore, the original double sum is:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q

Thus, the value of the double sum is:

"To find the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} \), we will evaluate each term separately and then sum them up.

First, let's evaluate \( f(-2) \):
\[
f(-2) = \frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2
\]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(-1) \):
\[
f(-1) = \frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(0) \):
\[
f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1
\]

Now, we sum these values:
\[
f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \frac{5}{3} + 1
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2, \(\frac{5}{3}\), and 1 is 3. We convert 2 and 1 to fractions with a denominator of 3:
\[
2 = \frac{6}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 = \frac{3}{3}
\]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \frac{14}{3}

Therefore, the value of \( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \) is \(\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}\).","[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",\frac{14}{3},"[14/3, '\\frac{14}{3}']",True
"To determine how many positive divisors the number 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. We can do this by dividing 196 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide:

\[
196 \div 2 = 98
\]
\[
98 \div 2 = 49
\]
\[
49 \div 7 = 7
\]
\[
7 \div 7 = 1
\]

So, the prime factorization of 196 is:

\[
196 = 2^2 \times 7^2
\]

To find the number of positive divisors of a number, we use the formula that involves adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results. For the number 196, the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each of these exponents gives us 3 and 3. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is:

\[
(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

We can list these divisors to verify: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196. There are indeed 9 positive divisors.

Thus, the number of positive divisors of 196 is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To determine which student has the highest average speed, we need to calculate the average speed for each student. The formula for average speed is given by:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

From the graph, we can see that each unit on the distance axis represents 1 mile and each unit on the time axis represents 1 second. Therefore, the total distance each student traveled is the y-coordinate of their respective dot, and the total time each student took is the x-coordinate of their respective dot.

Let's calculate the average speed for each student:

1. **Evelyn:**
   - Distance: 4.5 miles
   - Time: 1.25 seconds
   - Average speed: \(\frac{4.5 \text{ miles}}{1.25 \text{ seconds}} = 3.6 \text{ miles/second}\)

   - Time: 2.5 seconds
   - Average speed: \(\frac{2.2 \text{ miles}}{2.5 \text{ seconds}} = 0.88 \text{ miles/second}\)

3. **Carla:**
   - Distance: 5.2 miles
   - Time: 4.25 seconds
   - Average speed: \(\frac{5.2 \text{ miles}}{4.25 \text{ seconds}} = 1.22 \text{ miles/second}\)

4. **Debra:**
   - Distance: 2.8 miles
   - Time: 5.6 seconds
   - Average speed: \(\frac{2.8 \text{ miles}}{5.6 \text{ seconds}} = 0.5 \text{ miles/second}\)

5. **Angela:**
   - Distance: 1.4 miles
   - Time: 6.8 seconds
   - Average speed: \(\frac{1.4 \text{ miles}}{6.8 \text{ seconds}} = 0.2 \text{ miles/second}\)

"To determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon, we start by understanding the relationship between the regular hexagon and the equilateral triangle. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each of which has the same side length as the side length of the hexagon.

Given that the perimeter of one of these equilateral triangles is 21 inches, we can find the side length of the equilateral triangle. Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, the side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle is:
\[
s = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is also 7 inches. A regular hexagon has six equal sides, so the perimeter \( P \) of the hexagon is:
\[
P = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ inches}

Therefore, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is \(\boxed{42}\) inches.","[42, '42']",42,"[42, '42']",True
"To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, we start by letting the three consecutive integers be \( n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n+2 \). The sum of these three integers is:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect cube. Let's denote the perfect cube by \( k^3 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Therefore, we have:
\[
3(n+1) = k^3
\]
This implies that \( k^3 \) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is a prime number, \( k \) must also be divisible by 3. Let \( k = 3m \), where \( m \) is an integer. Substituting \( k = 3m \) into the equation, we get:
\[
3(n+1) = (3m)^3 = 27m^3
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
\[
n+1 = 9m^3
\]
Thus, \( n = 9m^3 - 1 \). To find the smallest positive perfect cube, we start with the smallest positive integer value for \( m \), which is 1. Substituting \( m = 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[
n = 9(1)^3 - 1 = 8
\]
Now, we calculate the sum of the three consecutive integers:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 8 + 9 + 10 = 27
\]
We check if 27 is a perfect cube:
\[
27 = 3^3

"To find the angle between the two lines given by the conditions \(2x = 3y = -z\) and \(6x = -y = -4z\), we first need to determine the direction vectors of these lines.

For the line \(2x = 3y = -z\), we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(t\):
\[x = t, \quad y = \frac{2}{3}t, \quad z = -2t.\]
Thus, the direction vector \(\mathbf{d_1}\) of this line is:
\[\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{2}{3} \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]

For the line \(6x = -y = -4z\), we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of a parameter \(s\):
\[x = s, \quad y = -6s, \quad z = \frac{3}{2}s.\]
Thus, the direction vector \(\mathbf{d_2}\) of this line is:
\[\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -6 \\ \frac{3}{2} \end{pmatrix}.\]

The angle \(\theta\) between two vectors \(\mathbf{d_1}\) and \(\mathbf{d_2}\) is given by the formula:
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2}}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\| \|\mathbf{d_2}\|}.\]

First, we calculate the dot product \(\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2}\):
\[\mathbf{d_1} \cdot \mathbf{d_2} = 1 \cdot 1 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot (-6) + (-2) \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 1 - 4 - 3 = -6.\]

Next, we calculate the magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{d_1}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{d_2}\|\):
\[\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{9} + 4} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{9}} = \frac{7}{3},\]
\[\|\mathbf{d_2}\| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-6)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 36 + \frac{9}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{169}{4}} = \frac{13}{2}.\]

Now, we can find \(\cos \theta\):
\[\cos \theta = \frac{-6}{\frac{7}{3} \cdot \frac{13}{2}} = \frac{-6}{\frac{91}{6}} = \frac{-6 \cdot 6}{91} = \frac{-36}{91}.\]

The angle \(\theta\) is then:
\[\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-36}{91}\right).\]

To convert this angle to degrees, we use a calculator:
\[\theta \approx 111.80^\circ.\]

Thus, the angle between the two lines is:

"To determine how many different values can be obtained by placing parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\), we need to consider all possible ways to group the multiplication operations. The expression can be grouped in the following ways:

"To find the smallest positive number that can be formed using only the digits 0 and 2 and is a multiple of 30, we need to consider the divisibility rules for 30. A number is divisible by 30 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 10.

First, for a number to be divisible by 10, its last digit must be 0. So, the number must end in 0.

Next, for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since the number is formed using only the digits 0 and 2, the sum of its digits will be a multiple of 2 (because each digit is 2). We need to find the smallest number of 2's such that their sum is divisible by 3. The smallest such number is 3, because \(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\), and 6 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, the smallest number that meets both criteria is 2220. Let's verify:
- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 10.

"To find the value of \( p(8) \) for the polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 that satisfies \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we start by defining a new polynomial \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). Notice that \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 7 because \( p(x) \) is of degree 5 and \( x^2 - 1 \) is of degree 2. For \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we have:

\[ q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = (n^2 - 1) \cdot \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} - n = n - n = 0. \]

Thus, \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 7, it can be expressed as:

\[ q(x) = c(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(x-r) \]

for some constants \( c \) and \( r \). To find \( c \) and \( r \), we need to consider the leading coefficient of \( q(x) \). The leading term of \( q(x) \) is \( c x^7 \), and the leading term of \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \) is \( c x^7 \) as well (since the leading term of \( p(x) \) is \( c x^5 \) and multiplying by \( x^2 \) gives \( c x^7 \)). Therefore, the leading term of \( q(x) \) is \( c x^7 \), and we can conclude that \( c = 1 \). Thus, we have:

\[ q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(x-r). \]

To find \( r \), we can use the fact that \( q(0) = (0-2)(0-3)(0-4)(0-5)(0-6)(0-7)(0-r) = (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-r) = 5040r \). We also know that \( q(0) = (0^2 - 1)p(0) - 0 = -p(0) \). However, we do not have the value of \( p(0) \) directly, so we will use another approach to find \( r \).

We can use the fact that \( q(8) = (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)(8-r) = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot (8-r) = 720(8-r) \). We also know that \( q(8) = (8^2 - 1)p(8) - 8 = 63p(8) - 8 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 63p(8) - 8 = 720(8-r). \]

To find \( r \), we need to solve this equation. However, we can use the fact that \( r \) must be a root of the polynomial \( q(x) \) that is not among the roots \( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 7, it must have a root \( r \) that is not among the roots \( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Therefore, we can conclude that \( r = 8 \).

Thus, we have:

\[ q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(x-8). \]

Therefore, we have:

\[ q(8) = 0. \]

Thus, we have:

\[ 63p(8) - 8 = 0 \implies 63p(8) = 8 \implies p(8) = \frac{8}{63}. \]

First, we find the proper divisors of 284. A proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. We start by checking if 284 is divisible by small prime numbers.

- 284 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142.

   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

"To find the value of the sum \(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \dots + 99 - 100\), we can break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Notice that the sum can be rewritten as a series of pairs:

"To determine the minimum value of \( c \) for the function \( y = a \sin(bx + c) + d \) given the graph, we need to analyze the graph and identify the key features of the sine function.

1. **Identify the amplitude, period, vertical shift, and phase shift:**
   - The amplitude \( a \) is the maximum value of the function minus the vertical shift \( d \) divided by 2. From the graph, the maximum value is 3 and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the amplitude is:
     \[
     a = \frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = 2
     \]
   - The vertical shift \( d \) is the average of the maximum and minimum values:
     \[
     d = \frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = 1
     \]
   - The period of the sine function is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs. From the graph, the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \). The period of the sine function \( y = a \sin(bx + c) + d \) is given by \( \frac{2\pi}{b} \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{2\pi}{b} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \implies b = 3
     \]
   - The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the sine function. The phase shift can be found by looking at the x-coordinate of the first peak or trough. From the graph, the first peak occurs at \( x = 0 \). For the standard sine function \( y = \sin(x) \), the first peak occurs at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, the phase shift is:
     \[
     \text{Phase shift} = \frac{\pi}{2} - 0 = \frac{\pi}{2}
     \]
     Since the phase shift is positive, the graph is shifted to the left by \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). For the function \( y = a \sin(bx + c) + d \), the phase shift is given by \( -\frac{c}{b} \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     -\frac{c}{3} = \frac{\pi}{2} \implies c = -\frac{3\pi}{2}
     \]

"To determine the value of \( x \) in the given geometric configuration, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles and the sides of the triangle \( ABC \).

Given:
- \( \overline{BC} \) is a line segment.
- A line passes through \( A \) and is parallel to \( \overline{BC} \).
- \( AB = BC \).
- The angle at \( A \) is \( 124^\circ \).

First, let's denote the point where the line through \( A \) intersects \( \overline{BC} \) as \( D \). Since \( AD \) is parallel to \( BC \), the angle \( \angle BAD \) is equal to the angle \( \angle ABC \) because they are corresponding angles. Therefore, \( \angle ABC = 124^\circ \).

Next, we know that \( AB = BC \), so triangle \( ABC \) is isosceles with \( \angle BAC = 124^\circ \). The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Let \( \angle BCA = \angle BAC = 124^\circ \). Then, we can find \( \angle ABC \) as follows:
\[
\angle ABC = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 124^\circ - 124^\circ = -68^\circ
\]
However, this calculation is incorrect because we should have \( \angle BCA = \angle BAC = 124^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 2 \times 124^\circ = 180^\circ - 248^\circ = -68^\circ \). This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to consider the correct angle relationships. Since \( AB = BC \), the correct angle at \( B \) is \( 180^\circ - 124^\circ = 56^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BCA = 56^\circ \).

Now, we need to find \( \angle BAC \). Since \( \angle BAC = 124^\circ \), the correct angle at \( B \) is \( 56^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BCA = 56^\circ \).

The correct value of \( x \) is:

"To determine the minimum value of \(a\) for which the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) has all real roots, we start by assuming that the roots of the polynomial are \(r, s,\) and \(t\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots and the coefficients of the polynomial:

\[
r + s + t = -a,
\]
\[
rs + rt + st = a,
\]
\[
rst = -1.
\]

We need to find the conditions under which these equations hold for real numbers \(r, s,\) and \(t\). Let's consider the polynomial in a different form. Notice that:

\[
x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1).
\]

For the polynomial to have all real roots, the quadratic factor \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1\) must have real roots. The discriminant of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 = 0\) must be non-negative:

\[
(a-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \geq 0,
\]
\[
(a-1)^2 - 4 \geq 0,
\]
\[
(a-1)^2 \geq 4,
\]
\[
|a-1| \geq 2.
\]

This inequality gives us two cases to consider:

1. \(a-1 \geq 2\), which implies \(a \geq 3\),
2. \(a-1 \leq -2\), which implies \(a \leq -1\).

Since \(a\) is a positive real number, we discard the second case. Therefore, the minimum value of \(a\) is 3. We need to verify that \(a = 3\) indeed gives all real roots for the polynomial \(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\):

\[
x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x+1)^3.
\]

The polynomial \((x+1)^3\) has a triple root at \(x = -1\), which is a real root. Thus, \(a = 3\) is the minimum value for which the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) has all real roots.

"To find the value of \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\) and determine the greatest integer less than or equal to this value, we can use the binomial theorem and some approximations. Let's start by approximating \(\sqrt{7}\) and \(\sqrt{5}\).

We know that:
\[
\sqrt{7} \approx 2.64575 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{5} \approx 2.23607
\]
Thus,
\[
\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5} \approx 2.64575 + 2.23607 = 4.88182

Now, we need to compute \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\). Using the approximation, we get:

To find \(4.88182^6\), we can use a calculator:
\[
4.88182^6 \approx 12599.21049

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the ratio of Denali's fee to Nate's fee remains the same under the new conditions. Let's denote the fee per köpek by \( f \).

### Step 1: Calculate the initial fees
- Denali initially has 16 köpek, so his initial fee is \( 16f \).
- Nate initially has 12 köpek, so his initial fee is \( 12f \).

### Step 2: Determine the new fees under the new conditions
#### Condition 1: Denali's fees are \( 4x \) more than Nate's fees, and Nate has 12 köpek.
- Denali's new fee is \( 12f + 4xf \).
- Nate's new fee is \( 12f \).

#### Condition 2: Nate's fees are \( x \) more than Denali's fees, and Denali has 12 köpek.
- Denali's new fee is \( 12f \).
- Nate's new fee is \( 12f + xf \).

### Step 3: Set up the ratio condition
The ratio of Denali's fee to Nate's fee must be the same in both conditions. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{16f + 4xf}{12f} = \frac{12f}{12f + xf}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the left side of the equation
\[
\frac{16f + 4xf}{12f} = \frac{4(4 + x)}{12} = \frac{4 + x}{3}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the right side of the equation
\[
\frac{12f}{12f + xf} = \frac{12}{12 + x}
\]

### Step 6: Set the simplified ratios equal to each other
\[
\frac{4 + x}{3} = \frac{12}{12 + x}
\]

### Step 7: Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \)
\[
(4 + x)(12 + x) = 36
\]

### Step 8: Expand and simplify the equation
\[
48 + 4x + 12x + x^2 = 36
\]
\[
x^2 + 16x + 48 = 36
\]
\[
x^2 + 16x + 12 = 0
\]

### Step 9: Solve the quadratic equation
We can solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 16x + 12 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = 12 \).

"To solve the equation \( x = \sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \), we will follow a step-by-step approach to isolate the square root and then eliminate it by squaring both sides of the equation.

1. **Isolate the square root term:**
   \[
   x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x}
   \]

2. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**
   \[
   (x - 4)^2 = (\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x
   \]

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0

4. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 5 = 0
   \]
   So, the solutions are:
   \[

6. **Verify the solutions in the original equation:**

     Simplifying inside the square root:

     Since \(\sqrt{9} = 3\):
     \[
     1 = 3 + 4

     \[
     1 = 7

     This is not true, so \( x = 1 \) is not a solution.

   - For \( x = 5 \):
     \[

     Since \(\sqrt{1} = 1\):
     \[
     5 = 1 + 4

     \[
     5 = 5

     This is true, so \( x = 5 \) is a solution.

"To determine the asgari bileşik faiz oranı, we need to calculate the total amount of money the person will have after three years and then find the interest earned. The person earns a fixed salary of $20,000 each year and saves the entire amount in a tax-free account. At the end of the third year, the person needs to have at least $66,200 to buy an apartment, so the interest earned must be at least the difference between $66,200 and the total amount saved.

First, let's calculate the total amount saved after three years:
\[
\text{Total amount saved} = 3 \times 20,000 = 60,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much additional money is required to buy the apartment:
\[
\text{Additional amount needed} = 66,200 - 60,000 = 6,200
\]

This additional amount is the interest earned over the three years. To find the annual interest rate, we need to use the formula for simple interest:
\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]
Here, the principal is the total amount saved, the time is 3 years, and the interest is $6,200. Let \( r \) be the annual interest rate. Then:
\[
6,200 = 60,000 \times r \times 3
\]

Solving for \( r \):
\[
6,200 = 180,000r
\]
\[
r = \frac{6,200}{180,000} = \frac{62}{1,800} = \frac{31}{900} \approx 0.034444

"To solve the functional equation \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \) given that \( f(1) = 1 \), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's set \( y = 0 \) in the functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(0) = f(x + 0) - x \cdot 0 - 1 \implies f(x) + f(0) = f(x) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1.
\]

Next, let's set \( y = 1 \) in the functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1 \implies f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2.
\]

We now have a recurrence relation for \( f \):
\[
f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2.
\]

To find a general form for \( f(x) \), we can use the recurrence relation iteratively. Let's compute the first few values of \( f \):
\[

\]
\[
f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8,
\]
\[
f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13.
\]

It seems that \( f(n) = n^2 \) might be a solution. Let's verify this by substituting \( f(x) = x^2 \) into the original functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(y) = x^2 + y^2,
\]
\[
f(x + y) - xy - 1 = (x + y)^2 - xy - 1 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - xy - 1 = x^2 + y^2 + xy - 1.
\]

Since \( x^2 + y^2 \neq x^2 + y^2 + xy - 1 \), \( f(x) = x^2 \) is not a solution. Let's try another approach. We know that \( f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2 \). Let's assume \( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) and substitute it into the recurrence relation:
\[
f(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2 + a(x + 1) + b = x^2 + 2x + 1 + ax + a + b = x^2 + (a + 2)x + (a + b + 1),
\]
\[
f(x) + x + 2 = x^2 + ax + b + x + 2 = x^2 + (a + 1)x + (b + 2).
\]

For these two expressions to be equal, we must have:
\[
a + 2 = a + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad a + b + 1 = b + 2.

The first equation is a contradiction, so \( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) is not the correct form. Let's try \( f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 1 \):

\[
f(x) + x + 2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + x + 2 = x^2 + 3x + 3.

"To determine the profit or loss from the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then compare it to the amount of money received from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The cost of the three items priced at \$1 each is:
  \[
  3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The cost of the one item priced at \$2 is:
  \[
  1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The cost of the one item priced at \$1 is:
  \[
  1 \times 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
  \]
Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[

\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the items:
- The revenue from selling the three items priced at \$1 each is:

- The revenue from selling the one item priced at \$1 is:
  \[

  \]
Adding these revenues together gives the total revenue:
\[

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:

"To solve the problem, we need to rotate the complex number \(7 + 2i\) by \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin. A \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise rotation of a complex number \(a + bi\) is equivalent to multiplying it by \(i\). This is because multiplying by \(i\) corresponds to a rotation by \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise in the complex plane.

Let's start with the complex number \(7 + 2i\). We need to multiply this by \(i\):

"To determine the number of different tables that can be formed, we need to consider the constraints given: there are 5 upper-class askers and 10 lower-class askers in a certain area of Atina, and Termopylae Savaşı requires 4 upper-class askers and 8 lower-class askers.

The problem can be broken down into two parts:
1. Choose 4 upper-class askers out of 5.
2. Choose 8 lower-class askers out of 10.

The number of ways to choose 4 upper-class askers out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{4} \), which is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 5

The number of ways to choose 8 lower-class askers out of 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{8} \), which is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{10}{8} = \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \frac{10!}{8!2!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2 \cdot 1} = 45

"To determine the eighth term of the given geometric sequence \(\frac{125}{9}, \frac{25}{3}, 5, 3, \ldots\), we first need to identify the first term and the common ratio of the sequence.

The first term \(a\) is \(\frac{125}{9}\).

The common ratio \(r\) is the ratio of the second term to the first term:
\[
r = \frac{\frac{25}{3}}{\frac{125}{9}} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{125} = \frac{25 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 125} = \frac{225}{375} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence is:
\[
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}.
\]

For the eighth term (\(a_8\)), we substitute \(a = \frac{125}{9}\), \(r = \frac{3}{5}\), and \(n = 8\):
\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{7}.
\]

First, we calculate \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7\):
\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7 = \frac{3^7}{5^7} = \frac{2187}{78125}.
\]

Now, we substitute this back into the formula for \(a_8\):
\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{2187}{78125} = \frac{125 \cdot 2187}{9 \cdot 78125}.
\]

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(125 = 5^3\) and \(78125 = 5^7\), so:
\[
\frac{125}{78125} = \frac{5^3}{5^7} = \frac{1}{5^4} = \frac{1}{625}.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
a_8 = \frac{2187}{9 \cdot 625} = \frac{2187}{5625}.
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{2187}{5625}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2187 and 5625. The GCD of 2187 and 5625 is 3, so:
\[
\frac{2187 \div 3}{5625 \div 3} = \frac{729}{1875}.
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{729}{1875}\) further by finding the GCD of 729 and 1875. The GCD of 729 and 1875 is 3, so:
\[
\frac{729 \div 3}{1875 \div 3} = \frac{243}{625}.
\]

Therefore, the eighth term of the geometric sequence is:

\boxed{\frac{243}{625}}.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To solve the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we will start by simplifying and expanding both sides of the equation.

First, let's expand each term:
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
\[
(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343
\]
\[
(2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Now, substitute these expansions into the original equation:
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Next, move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero:
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0
\]
\[
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0
\]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by -6:
\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0
\]

Now, we need to find the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, \(p/q\), is a factor of the constant term (-105) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 5, \pm 7, \pm 15, \pm 21, \pm 35, \pm 105 \).

Let's test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:

For \(x = 3\):
\[
3^3 - 15 \cdot 3^2 + 71 \cdot 3 - 105 = 27 - 135 + 213 - 105 = 0
\]
So, \(x = 3\) is a root.

We can now factor \(x - 3\) out of the polynomial \(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105\). Using synthetic division:

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
  3 & 1 & -15 & 71 & -105 \\
    &   & 3  & -36 & 105 \\
  \hline
    & 1 & -12 & 35 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \(x^2 - 12x + 35\). So, we can write:
\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35)
\]

Next, we factor \(x^2 - 12x + 35\):
\[
x^2 - 12x + 35 = (x - 5)(x - 7)
\]

Therefore, the polynomial factors completely as:
\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = (x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7)
\]

The roots of the equation are the solutions to \((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\), which are:
\[
x = 3, \quad x = 5, \quad x = 7
\]

Thus, the roots of the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\) are \(\boxed{3, 5, 7}\).","[{3, 5, 7}, '3, 5, 7']","3, 5, 7","[7, '7']",True

1. **Identify the number of sides of the pentagon:**
   A regular pentagon has 5 sides.

The radius of the circle circumscribing the hexagon can be found using the fact that the side length of a regular hexagon is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle.

Given that the side length of the hexagon is 16 cm, the radius \( R \) of the circumscribed circle is also 16 cm.

Next, we need to find the side length of the regular octagon inscribed in this circle. The side length \( s \) of a regular octagon inscribed in a circle of radius \( R \) can be calculated using the formula:

\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) is not necessarily the one that makes \(x > 7\). However, the problem specifically asks for the value of \(x + y\) under the condition \(x > 7\), which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Given the problem constraints and the correct interpretation, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:

First, note that:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + y^2 + 400} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 400}
\]
\[
\sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + x^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 900}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}
\]

This represents the sum of the distances from the point \((x, y)\) to the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((40, 50)\) with an additional constant term in the first two distances. To minimize this expression, we need to find the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of the distances to these points.

The point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of the distances to three points is the Fermat point of the triangle formed by these points. However, in this case, the points \((0, 0)\) and \((0, 0)\) are the same, so we only need to consider the distance to \((40, 50)\).

The minimum distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((40, 50)\) is the straight line distance, which is:
\[
\sqrt{(40-0)^2 + (50-0)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 2500} = \sqrt{4100}

"To determine the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position, we need to consider the components of Bill's journey in the north-south and east-west directions.

1. **North-South Direction:**
   - Bill first travels \(\frac{1}{2}\) mile north.
   - Then he travels \(\frac{1}{2}\) mile south.
   The net movement in the north-south direction is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \text{ miles}
   \]
   So, Bill's final position is directly east of his starting point.

2. **East-West Direction:**
   - Bill travels \(\frac{3}{4}\) mile east.
   The net movement in the east-west direction is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \text{ miles}
   \]
   So, Bill's final position is \(\frac{3}{4}\) mile east of his starting point.

3. ** Straight-Line Distance:**
   Since Bill's final position is directly east of his starting point, the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position is simply the distance he traveled east, which is \(\frac{3}{4}\) mile.

To convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) mile to a percentage of a mile, we note that 1 mile is 100%, so:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \text{ mile} = \left(\frac{3}{4} \times 100\right)\% = 75\%

"To solve the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) and find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots are \( n \)-th roots of unity, we start by making a substitution. Let \( w = z^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \):

\[ w^2 + w + 1 = 0. \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \):

\[ w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

So, the solutions for \( w \) are:

\[ w = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Next, we need to find the corresponding values of \( z \). Since \( w = z^2 \), we take the square roots of \( w \). The square roots of a complex number \( re^{i\theta} \) are given by \( \sqrt{r} e^{i(\theta/2)} \) and \( \sqrt{r} e^{i(\theta/2 + \pi)} \).

First, we express \( w = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) in polar form. The magnitude \( r \) is:

\[ r = \sqrt{\left( \frac{-1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1. \]

The argument \( \theta \) is:

\[ \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{-1/2} \right) = \tan^{-1} (-\sqrt{3}) = \frac{2\pi}{3}. \]

So, \( w = e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}} \). The square roots of \( w \) are:

\[ z = e^{i \frac{\pi}{3}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \]
\[ z = e^{i \frac{4\pi}{3}} = \cos \frac{4\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{4\pi}{3} = -\frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Next, we express \( w = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) in polar form. The magnitude \( r \) is:

\[ r = \sqrt{\left( \frac{-1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1. \]

The argument \( \theta \) is:

\[ \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{-\sqrt{3}/2}{-1/2} \right) = \tan^{-1} (\sqrt{3}) = \frac{4\pi}{3}. \]

So, \( w = e^{i \frac{4\pi}{3}} \). The square roots of \( w \) are:

\[ z = e^{i \frac{5\pi}{3}} = \cos \frac{5\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \]
\[ z = e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Thus, the roots of the equation \( z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \) are:

\[ z = \frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad z = \frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad z = -\frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad z = -\frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

These roots are the 6th roots of unity, because they can be written as \( e^{i \frac{k\pi}{3}} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that all the roots are \( n \)-th roots of unity is:

"To find the dikey asimptotları, yatay asimptotu, ve their sum for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the dikey asimptotları:**
   The dikey asimptotları occur where the denominator is zero, as these are the values of \( x \) that make the function undefined.

   The denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the dikey asimptotları are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the yatay asimptotu:**
   The yatay asimptotu occurs as \( x \) approaches infinity or negative infinity. To find it, we look at the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

   The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the yatay asimptotu is \( y = 0 \).

   So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

"To determine which power of 4 equals 8, we need to solve the equation \(4^x = 8\). We can express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2. We know that \(4 = 2^2\) and \(8 = 2^3\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the left side of the equation:

First, let's denote the degree of \( f(x) \) by \( n \). The degree of the polynomial on the left-hand side of the equation is the sum of the degrees of \( (x-1) \) and \( f(x) \). Since the degree of \( (x-1) \) is 1, the degree of \( (x-1) \cdot f(x) \) is \( n+1 \).

The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side of the equation is 4, because the highest degree term in \( 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 \) is \( 3x^4 \).

1^3 - 3 \cdot 1^2 + 4 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 - 3 + 4 - 1 = 1 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \( x = -1 \):
\[
(-1)^3 - 3 \cdot (-1)^2 + 4 \cdot (-1) - 1 = -1 - 3 - 4 - 1 = -9 \neq 0.
\]
Since neither \( x = 1 \) nor \( x = -1 \) is a root, we conclude that the roots are not rational. However, we can still use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as \( (x - \alpha)(x - \beta)(x - \gamma) \) where \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are the roots.

Given that \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) is divisible by \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \), it means that the roots of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) are also roots of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r = (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r = x^9 + ax^8 + bx^7 + cx^6 + dx^5 + ex^4 + fx^3 - 3x^8 - 3ax^7 - 3bx^6 - 3cx^5 - 3dx^4 - 3ex^3 - 3fx^2 + 4x^7 + 4ax^6 + 4bx^5 + 4cx^4 + 4dx^3 + 4ex^2 - 4x^6 - 4ax^5 - 4bx^4 - 4cx^3 - 4dx^2 - 4ex + x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c - 3x^2 - 3ax - 3b + 4x - 4a + f.
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r = x^9 + (a-3)x^8 + (b-3a+4)x^7 + (c-3b+4a-4)x^6 + (d-3c+4b-4a)x^5 + (e-3d+4c-4b)x^4 + (f-3e+4d-4c)x^3 + (4e-4d)x^2 + (4f-4e+4)x - 3f.
\]
By comparing coefficients with \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \), we get:
\[
a - 3 = 0, \quad b - 3a + 4 = 0, \quad c - 3b + 4a - 4 = 0, \quad d - 3c + 4b - 4a = 0, \quad e - 3d + 4c - 4b = 0, \quad f - 3e + 4d - 4c = 0, \quad 4e - 4d = 0, \quad 4f - 4e + 4 = 0, \quad -3f = r.
\]
Solving these equations step by step:
1. \( a = 3 \)
2. \( b - 3(3) + 4 = 0 \implies b - 9 + 4 = 0 \implies b = 5 \)
3. \( c - 3(5) + 4(3) - 4 = 0 \implies c - 15 + 12 - 4 = 0 \implies c - 7 = 0 \implies c = 7 \)
4. \( d - 3(7) + 4(5) - 4(3) = 0 \implies d - 21 + 20 - 12 = 0 \implies d - 13 = 0 \implies d = 13 \)
5. \( e - 3(13) + 4(7) - 4(5) = 0 \implies e - 39 + 28 - 20 = 0 \implies e - 31 = 0 \implies e = 31 \)
6. \( f - 3(31) + 4(13) - 4(7) = 0 \implies f - 93 + 52 - 28 = 0 \implies f - 69 = 0 \implies f = 69 \)
7. \( 4e - 4d = 0 \implies 4(31) - 4(13) = 0 \implies 124 - 52 = 0 \implies 72 = 0 \) (This is consistent)
8. \( 4f - 4e + 4 = 0 \implies 4(69) - 4(31) + 4 = 0 \implies 276 - 124 + 4 = 0 \implies 156 = 0 \) (This is consistent)
9. \( -3f = r \implies -3(69) = r \implies r = -207 \)

Thus, the coefficients \( p, q, r \) are \( p = 0 \), \( q = 0 \), and \( r = -207 \). Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the polynomial equation \(8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\) with three distinct positive roots \(x_1, x_2, x_3\), we can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. According to Vieta's formulas, we have:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -\frac{4a}{8} = -\frac{a}{2},
\]
\[
x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_1 = \frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4},
\]
\[
x_1x_2x_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.
\]

We are also given that the sum of the logarithms of the roots taken two at a time is 5. That is,

\[
\log x_1 + \log x_2 + \log x_3 = 5.
\]

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log x_1 + \log x_2 + \log x_3 = \log (x_1 x_2 x_3)\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\log (x_1 x_2 x_3) = 5.
\]

This implies that

\[
x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^5.
\]

From Vieta's formula for the product of the roots, we have

\[
x_1 x_2 x_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(x_1 x_2 x_3\), we get

\[
-\frac{a}{8} = 10^5.

\[

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm (or induced norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To solve the problem, we start by factoring the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). We can use a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^4\). Then the polynomial becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):

\[y^2 + 3y - 4.\]

We can factor this quadratic polynomial as follows:

\[y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1).\]

Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we get:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1).\]

Next, we factor \(x^4 - 1\). Notice that \(x^4 - 1\) is a difference of squares:

\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1).\]

We can further factor \(x^2 - 1\) as another difference of squares:

\[x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1).\]

So, the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) can be written as:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\]

We need to check if these factors are irreducible over the integers. The polynomial \(x + 1\) and \(x - 1\) are linear and therefore irreducible. The polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) is also irreducible over the integers because it has no real roots. Finally, we need to check if \(x^4 + 4\) can be factored further over the integers. We can use the Sophie Germain identity to factor \(x^4 + 4\):

\[x^4 + 4 = (x^4 + 4x^2 + 4) - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]

Both \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) and \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) are irreducible over the integers because their discriminants are negative:

\[2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4,\]
\((-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4.\]

Thus, the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) can be factored into irreducible monic polynomials over the integers as:

\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\]

Now, we need to find the sum \(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1)\). We evaluate each factor at \(x = 1\):

\[p_1(1) = 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5,\]
\[p_2(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2,\]
\[p_3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2,\]
\[p_4(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

\[p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1) = 5 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 9.\]

"To find the value of \(d\) in the equation \((\sin x)^7 = a \sin 7x + b \sin 5x + c \sin 3x + d \sin x\), we need to use the properties of trigonometric functions and their expansions. Specifically, we will use the fact that \(\sin x\) is an odd function and the symmetry of the sine function.

First, let's consider the function \((\sin x)^7\). Since \(\sin x\) is an odd function, \((\sin x)^7\) is also an odd function. This means that the right-hand side of the equation must also be an odd function. The terms \(a \sin 7x\), \(b \sin 5x\), and \(c \sin 3x\) are all odd functions, so the term \(d \sin x\) is also an odd function. Therefore, \(d\) can be any real number, but we need to determine its specific value.

To find \(d\), we can use the fact that the average value of \((\sin x)^7\) over one period (from \(0\) to \(2\pi\)) is the same as the average value of \(d \sin x\) over one period. The average value of \(\sin x\) over one period is zero, so the average value of \(d \sin x\) over one period is also zero. Therefore, the average value of \((\sin x)^7\) over one period must be equal to the average value of the remaining terms.

Let's calculate the average value of \((\sin x)^7\) over one period. We can use the identity \(\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\) to express \((\sin x)^7\) in terms of complex exponentials:
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \left(\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\right)^7 = \frac{1}{(2i)^7} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7.
\]
Expanding \((e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7\) using the binomial theorem, we get:
\[
(e^{ix} - e^{-ix})^7 = e^{7ix} - 7e^{5ix} + 21e^{3ix} - 35e^{ix} + 35e^{-ix} - 21e^{-3ix} + 7e^{-5ix} - e^{-7ix}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{7ix} - 7e^{5ix} + 21e^{3ix} - 35e^{ix} + 35e^{-ix} - 21e^{-3ix} + 7e^{-5ix} - e^{-7ix}) = \frac{1}{-128i} (e^{7ix} - e^{-7ix} - 7(e^{5ix} - e^{-5ix}) + 21(e^{3ix} - e^{-3ix}) - 35(e^{ix} - e^{-ix})).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\), we get:
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \frac{1}{-128i} (-2i \sin 7x - 7(-2i \sin 5x) + 21(-2i \sin 3x) - 35(-2i \sin x)) = \frac{1}{-128i} (-2i \sin 7x + 14i \sin 5x - 42i \sin 3x + 70i \sin x) = \frac{1}{-128} (-2 \sin 7x + 14 \sin 5x - 42 \sin 3x + 70 \sin x) = \frac{1}{64} (42 \sin 3x - 14 \sin 5x + 2 \sin 7x - 70 \sin x).
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
(\sin x)^7 = \frac{42}{64} \sin 3x - \frac{14}{64} \sin 5x + \frac{2}{64} \sin 7x - \frac{70}{64} \sin x = \frac{21}{32} \sin 3x - \frac{7}{32} \sin 5x + \frac{1}{32} \sin 7x - \frac{35}{32} \sin x.
\]
By comparing this with the original equation \((\sin x)^7 = a \sin 7x + b \sin 5x + c \sin 3x + d \sin x\), we see that \(d = -\frac{35}{32}\).

Therefore, the value of \(d\) is \(\boxed{-\frac{35}{32}}\).","[-35/32, '-\\frac{35}{32}']",\frac{35}{64},"[35/64, '\\frac{35}{64}']",False

3. Distribute the \(-3\) through the second set of parentheses.
4. Combine like terms.

Let's start with the expression:
\[ x\left(x(1+x)+2x\right)-3(x^2-x+2) \]

First, expand the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x(1+x) = x + x^2 \]
So the expression becomes:
\[ x(x + x^2 + 2x) - 3(x^2 - x + 2) \]

Next, combine the like terms inside the parentheses:
\[ x + x^2 + 2x = x^2 + 3x \]

\[ x(x^2 + 3x) - 3(x^2 - x + 2) \]

Now, distribute the \( x \) through the parentheses:
\[ x(x^2 + 3x) = x^3 + 3x^2 \]
So the expression now is:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - 3(x^2 - x + 2) \]

Next, distribute the \(-3\) through the second set of parentheses:
\[ -3(x^2 - x + 2) = -3x^2 + 3x - 6 \]
So the expression now is:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x^2 + 3x - 6 \]

Finally, combine the like terms:
\[ 3x^2 - 3x^2 = 0 \]
So the expression simplifies to:

The identity states that if \(A + B + C = 180^\circ\), then \(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C\).

In our problem, we can identify \(A = 53^\circ\), \(B = 81^\circ\), and \(C = x^\circ\). For the identity to hold, we must have \(53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ\). Solving for \(x\), we get:

"To find the value of \(9 \& 2\) using the given definition of the operation \(\&\), we start by substituting \(a = 9\) and \(b = 2\) into the expression \(a \& b = \frac{\sqrt{ab + a}}{\sqrt{ab - b}}\).

First, we calculate the numerator \(\sqrt{ab + a}\):
\[
ab + a = 9 \cdot 2 + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27
\]
So, the numerator is \(\sqrt{27}\). We can simplify \(\sqrt{27}\) as follows:
\[
\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator \(\sqrt{ab - b}\):
\[
ab - b = 9 \cdot 2 - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16
\]
So, the denominator is \(\sqrt{16}\). We know that:
\[
\sqrt{16} = 4
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression for \(9 \& 2\):
\[
9 \& 2 = \frac{\sqrt{27}}{\sqrt{16}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}

Thus, the value of \(9 \& 2\) is \(\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}}\).","[(3*sqrt(3))/4, '\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}']",\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4},[],True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Step 1: Rewrite \(\sec x\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\).
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Step 2: Find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\).
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Step 3: Use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\).
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by canceling out \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator.
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To determine the probability that the product of two numbers rolled on a 6-sided die is a multiple of 5, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each die:**
   Each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6.

2. **Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice:**
   Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

3. **Identify the conditions under which the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5:**
   A number is a multiple of 5 if it contains the digit 5. Therefore, for the product of two numbers to be a multiple of 5, at least one of the numbers must be 5.

4. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - If the first die shows 5, the second die can show any of the 6 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). This gives us 6 outcomes.
   - If the second die shows 5, the first die can show any of the 6 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). This also gives us 6 outcomes.
   - However, we have counted the outcome (5, 5) twice. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.

   The total number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   6 + 6 - 1 = 11

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the domain of the function \(\log x^2\) is \(x < a\) or \(x > b\), we need to analyze the expression inside the logarithm. The logarithm function \(\log y\) is defined for \(y > 0\). Therefore, for the function \(\log x^2\) to be defined, we need \(x^2 > 0\).

Let's solve the inequality \(x^2 > 0\):
- The expression \(x^2\) is a parabola that opens upwards and has its vertex at \(x = 0\).
- The parabola \(x^2\) is positive for all \(x\) except at \(x = 0\), where it is zero.
- Therefore, \(x^2 > 0\) for \(x < 0\) or \(x > 0\).

This means that the domain of the function \(\log x^2\) is \(x < 0\) or \(x > 0\). Comparing this with the given form \(x < a\) or \(x > b\), we can see that \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\).

"To solve the equation \(2^8 = 4^x\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. We know that \(4\) can be written as a power of \(2\), specifically \(4 = 2^2\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right side of the equation as follows:

\[4^x = (2^2)^x\]

Using the property of exponents that \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the right side:

\[(2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\]

Now our equation looks like this:

\[2^8 = 2^{2x}\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[8 = 2x\]

To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given function \( f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 \) and the equation \( f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b) \). We need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy this equation.

First, let's compute \( f(a) \):
\[ f(a) = a^3 + 3a^2 + 1. \]

Now, substitute \( f(x) \) and \( f(a) \) into the given equation:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 1) = (x - a)^2 (x - b). \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2 = (x - a)^2 (x - b). \]

Next, expand the right side:
\[ (x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2, \]
\[ (x - a)^2 (x - b) = (x^2 - 2ax + a^2)(x - b) = x^3 - bx^2 - 2ax^2 + 2abx + a^2x - a^2b = x^3 + (-b - 2a)x^2 + (2ab + a^2)x - a^2b. \]

Now, equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of \( x \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2 = x^3 + (-b - 2a)x^2 + (2ab + a^2)x - a^2b. \]

By comparing the coefficients of \( x^2 \), we get:
\[ 3 = -b - 2a. \]
Rearrange to solve for \( b \):
\[ b = -3 - 2a. \]

By comparing the constant terms, we get:
\[ -a^3 - 3a^2 = -a^2b. \]
Substitute \( b = -3 - 2a \) into the equation:
\[ -a^3 - 3a^2 = -a^2(-3 - 2a) = 3a^2 + 2a^3. \]
Rearrange to combine like terms:
\[ -a^3 - 3a^2 - 2a^3 - 3a^2 = 0, \]
\[ -3a^3 - 6a^2 = 0, \]
\[ -3a^2(a + 2) = 0. \]
Since \( a \neq 0 \), we have:

\[ a = -2. \]

1. Simplify the left side of the equation by calculating \(2^3\).
2. Compare the simplified left side to the right side of the equation to find the value of \(x\).

Let's start with the first step:

\[2^3 = 8\]

So the equation \(2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72\) becomes:

Next, we need to isolate \(3^x\). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

\[3^x = \frac{72}{8}\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

We know that \(9\) can be written as a power of 3:

\[9 = 3^2\]

So the equation \(3^x = 9\) becomes:

"To solve the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\) for a real solution \(x\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\), we start by using the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we use the property that \(a\log(b) = \log(b^a)\). Applying this property, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2)
\]

Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:

\[
kx = (x+2)^2
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
kx = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]

Rearranging all terms to one side of the equation gives us a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
\]

For this quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = 4-k\), and \(c = 4\), so the discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16

We need \(\Delta \geq 0\):

\[
(4-k)^2 - 16 \geq 0

This can be factored as:

\[
((4-k) - 4)((4-k) + 4) \geq 0
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(-k)(8-k) \geq 0

This inequality holds when \(k\) is in the interval \([0, 8]\). However, we also need to ensure that the solutions \(x\) to the quadratic equation are in the interval \([-500, 500]\) and that \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq -2\) (since the original equation involves \(\log(x+2)\), \(x\) must be greater than \(-2\)).

The quadratic equation is:

The product of the roots is given by \(\frac{c}{a}\). Here, the product of the roots is:

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Three squigs and one goolee together weigh as much as three squigs.
2. Two squigs and one goolee together weigh as much as one squig.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( 3S + G = 3S \)
2. \( 2S + G = S \)

Let's solve the first equation:
\[ 3S + G = 3S \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ G = 0 \]

So, the weight of one goolee is 0. Now, let's substitute \( G = 0 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2S + 0 = S \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2S = S \]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ S = 0 \]

So, the weight of one squig is also 0. Since both the weight of one squig and the weight of one goolee are 0, any number of squigs will have a total weight of 0, which is the same as the weight of one squig.

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

First, let's identify the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\). Point \(A\) can be any point inside or on the square with vertices \((0,0)\), \((2,0)\), \((2,2)\), and \((0,2)\). Point \(B\) can be any point inside or on the square with vertices \((4,2)\), \((5,2)\), \((5,3)\), and \((4,3)\).

To maximize the slope, we should choose the point \(A\) with the smallest \(x\)-coordinate and the point \(B\) with the largest \(x\)-coordinate, and the point \(A\) with the largest \(y\)-coordinate and the point \(B\) with the smallest \(y\)-coordinate. This will give us the maximum and minimum possible values for the slope.

1. The point \(A\) with the smallest \(x\)-coordinate is \((0,0)\) and the point \(B\) with the largest \(x\)-coordinate is \((5,3)\). The slope in this case is:

\[9^x + 19 = 10^x.\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving \(x\):

\[9^x - 10^x = -19.\]

To find a solution, we can test some simple values for \(x\). Let's start with \(x = 1\):

\[9^1 - 10^1 = 9 - 10 = -1.\]

Since \(-1\) is not equal to \(-19\), \(x = 1\) is not a solution. Now let's try \(x = 2\):

\[9^2 - 10^2 = 81 - 100 = -19.\]

Since \(-19\) is equal to \(-19\), \(x = 2\) is a solution. To confirm that there are no other solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x) = 9^x - 10^x\). The function \(9^x\) grows slower than \(10^x\) for \(x > 2\) and faster for \(x < 2\), so \(f(x)\) will have only one zero, which is at \(x = 2\).

Therefore, the solution to the equation \(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

1. Solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

2. Substitute \(a = -3\) into the other equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \quad \text{(True)}
\]
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the base of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume and the rate at which the volume is changing. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know that the volume is decreasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second, and the height is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per second. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = -20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We need to find the radius \( r \) when the height \( h \) is such that the volume is decreasing at the given rate. To do this, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} + 2\pi r h \frac{dr}{dt} \]

Since the radius \( r \) is constant, \( \frac{dr}{dt} = 0 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

\[ -20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ -20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{-20}{4} = -5 \]

Since \( r^2 \) cannot be negative, we must have made an error in the interpretation of the problem.

"To solve the equation \( |5x-1| = x+3 \), we need to consider the definition of the absolute value function. The expression \( |5x-1| \) can be broken down into two cases: \( 5x-1 \geq 0 \) and \( 5x-1 < 0 \).

**Case 1: \( 5x-1 \geq 0 \)**
In this case, \( |5x-1| = 5x-1 \). The equation becomes:
\[ 5x-1 = x+3 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 4x-1 = 3 \]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[ 4x = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 1 \]
We need to check if this solution satisfies the condition \( 5x-1 \geq 0 \). Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the condition:
\[ 5(1) - 1 = 4 \geq 0 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( 5x-1 < 0 \)**
In this case, \( |5x-1| = -(5x-1) = -5x+1 \). The equation becomes:
\[ -5x+1 = x+3 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ -6x+1 = 3 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ -6x = 2 \]
Divide both sides by -6:
\[ x = -\frac{1}{3} \]
We need to check if this solution satisfies the condition \( 5x-1 < 0 \). Substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) into the condition:
\[ 5\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - 1 = -\frac{5}{3} - 1 = -\frac{8}{3} < 0 \]
So, \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is a valid solution.

 Between the two solutions \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \), the larger value is \( x = 1 \).

Therefore, the largest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |5x-1| = x+3 \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) has at least one vertical asymptote, we need to analyze the function and its behavior at the point where the piecewise definition changes, which is at \(x = a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

A vertical asymptote occurs where the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches a certain value. In this case, we need to check the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from both the left and the right.

1. **Behavior as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right:**
   When \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). This is a finite value, so there is no vertical asymptote from the right.

2. **Behavior as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left:**
   When \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). This is also a finite value, so there is no vertical asymptote from the left.

Since the function does not approach infinity or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from either side, there is no vertical asymptote at \(x = a\) for any value of \(a\).

However, the problem asks for the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function has at least one vertical asymptote. The only way this can happen is if the function is undefined at \(x = a\), which is not the case here. Therefore, the function does not have any vertical asymptotes for any value of \(a\).

"To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers \(3339\), \(2961\), and \(1491\), we will use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

First, let's find the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\).

1. Divide \(3339\) by \(2961\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   3339 \div 2961 \approx 1.126 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   3339 - 1 \cdot 2961 = 3339 - 2961 = 378
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(378\).

2. Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(2961\) and \(378\):
   \[
   2961 \div 378 \approx 7.844 \quad \text{(integer part is 7)}
   \]
   \[
   2961 - 7 \cdot 378 = 2961 - 2646 = 315
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(315\).

3. Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(378\) and \(315\):
   \[
   378 \div 315 \approx 1.2 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   378 - 1 \cdot 315 = 378 - 315 = 63
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(63\).

4. Finally, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(315\) and \(63\):
   \[
   315 \div 63 = 5 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
   \]
   \[
   315 - 5 \cdot 63 = 315 - 315 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the GCD of \(3339\) and \(2961\) is \(63\).

Next, we need to find the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\).

1. Divide \(1491\) by \(63\) and find the remainder:
   \[
   1491 \div 63 \approx 23.571 \quad \text{(integer part is 23)}
   \]
   \[
   1491 - 23 \cdot 63 = 1491 - 1449 = 42
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(42\).

2. Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to \(63\) and \(42\):
   \[
   63 \div 42 \approx 1.5 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
   \]
   \[
   63 - 1 \cdot 42 = 63 - 42 = 21
   \]
   So, the remainder is \(21\).

   42 \div 21 = 2 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}

   \[
   42 - 2 \cdot 21 = 42 - 42 = 0

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the GCD of \(63\) and \(1491\) is \(21\).

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of trials (adans),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (adans with hazineye),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on an individual trial,
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

In this problem, \( n = 7 \), \( k = 4 \), and \( p = \frac{1}{5} \). The probability of failure, \( 1-p \), is \( \frac{4}{5} \).

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{7}{4} \):

\[ \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{4! \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35 \]

\[ p^4 = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625} \]
\[ (1-p)^{7-4} = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125} \]

Now, we substitute these values into the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = 35 \times \frac{1}{625} \times \frac{64}{125} = 35 \times \frac{64}{78125} = \frac{2240}{78125} \]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the right side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]

"To determine the measure of \(\angle AFD\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is divided into three equal areas by the lines \(AE\) and \(AFD\), and that \(\angle BAD = \angle CDA\). Additionally, we are given the measures of \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ADC\), which are \(110^\circ\) and \(100^\circ\) respectively.

First, we calculate the measure of \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle CDA\). Since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle BAD + \angle ABC + \angle CDA + \angle ADC = 360^\circ.
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
\angle BAD + 110^\circ + \angle CDA + 100^\circ = 360^\circ.
\]
Simplifying, we find:
\[
\angle BAD + \angle CDA = 150^\circ.
\]
Since \(\angle BAD = \angle CDA\), we have:
\[
2 \angle BAD = 150^\circ \implies \angle BAD = 75^\circ.
\]
Thus, \(\angle CDA = 75^\circ\).

Next, we need to find the measure of \(\angle AFD\). Since \(AFD\) is one of the three equal areas of the quadrilateral, the line \(AF\) must divide the quadrilateral into two regions of equal area, and then further divide one of those regions into two equal areas. This implies that \(AF\) is a line of symmetry for the quadrilateral in some sense.

Given that \(\angle ABC = 110^\circ\) and \(\angle ADC = 100^\circ\), and knowing that \(\angle BAD = \angle CDA = 75^\circ\), we can infer that the quadrilateral is not a simple rectangle or square, but it has a specific symmetry that allows us to find \(\angle AFD\).

The key insight is that the line \(AF\) must bisect the angle between the two non-adjacent sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) that are not part of the equal areas. Therefore, \(\angle AFD\) is the angle that completes the straight line with the angle between \(AB\) and \(CD\), which is \(180^\circ\).

Since \(\angle BAD = 75^\circ\) and \(\angle CDA = 75^\circ\), the angle between \(AB\) and \(CD\) is \(180^\circ - 75^\circ - 75^\circ = 30^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle AFD\) is:
\[
\angle AFD = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ.
\]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle AFD\) is \(\boxed{150}\).","[150, '150']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"To find the value of \( y \) such that the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ y \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) is projected onto the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and the projection is \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we start by using the formula for the projection of a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\):

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

First, we calculate \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
\]

Next, we calculate \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2 \cdot 1 + y \cdot (-2) + (-5) \cdot 1 = 2 - 2y - 5 = -3 - 2y
\]

Using the projection formula, we get:

\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \mathbf{u} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{-2(-3 - 2y)}{6} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{6 + 4y}{6} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \\ \frac{3 + 2y}{3} \\ \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} \end{pmatrix}
\]

We are given that this projection is equal to \(\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{5}{6} \\ -\frac{10}{6} \\ \frac{5}{6} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{5}{6} \\ -\frac{5}{3} \\ \frac{5}{6} \end{pmatrix}
\]

By comparing the corresponding components of the two vectors, we get:

\[
\frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

To solve for \( y \), we multiply both sides by 6:

\[
-3 - 2y = 5
\]

Next, we add 3 to both sides:

\[
-2y = 8
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by -2:

\[

First, let's rewrite each term in a more convenient form:
\[
\frac{( x+ 1)(x - 3)}{5(x + 2)(x - 4)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)},
\]
\[
\frac{(x + 3)(x - 5)}{9(x + 4)(x - 6)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 15}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)},
\]
\[
\frac{2(x + 5)(x - 7)}{13(x + 6)(x - 8)} = \frac{2(x^2 - 2x - 35)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{2x^2 - 4x - 70}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)}.
\]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The common denominator is \(5 \cdot 9 \cdot 13 \cdot (x^2 - 2x - 8)(x^2 - 2x - 24)(x^2 - 2x - 48)\). However, this approach is quite complex, so we will use a different method by testing possible rational roots.

Let's test some simple values for \(x\). We can start with \(x = 2\):
\[
\frac{(2+1)(2-3)}{5(2+2)(2-4)} + \frac{(2+3)(2-5)}{9(2+4)(2-6)} - \frac{2(2+5)(2-7)}{13(2+6)(2-8)} = \frac{3(-1)}{5(4)(-2)} + \frac{5(-3)}{9(6)(-4)} - \frac{2(7)(-5)}{13(8)(-6)} = \frac{-3}{-40} + \frac{-15}{-216} + \frac{70}{-624} = \frac{3}{40} + \frac{5}{72} - \frac{35}{312}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40, 72, and 312 is 1248. Converting each fraction:
\[
\frac{3}{40} = \frac{3 \cdot 31.2}{40 \cdot 31.2} = \frac{93.6}{1248},
\]
\[
\frac{5}{72} = \frac{5 \cdot 17.4444}{72 \cdot 17.4444} = \frac{87.2222}{1248},
\]
\[
\frac{35}{312} = \frac{35 \cdot 4.0}{312 \cdot 4.0} = \frac{140}{1248}.
\]

Adding these fractions:
\[
\frac{93.6}{1248} + \frac{87.2222}{1248} - \frac{140}{1248} = \frac{40.8222}{1248} \approx \frac{92}{585}.

"To determine the direction in which the buz patencisi will face after it has turned 2250 degrees to the right, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the full rotation**: A full rotation is 360 degrees. Therefore, we need to find out how many full rotations and additional degrees are involved in the 2250-degree turn.

2. **Calculate the number of full rotations**: Divide 2250 by 360 to find the number of full rotations and the remaining degrees.
   \[
   2250 \div 360 = 6.25

First, let's denote \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\).

### Step 1: Use the dot product condition
The dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y + 1 \cdot z = x + y + z
\]
We know that \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2\), so:
\[
x + y + z = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Step 2: Use the cross product condition
The cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot y) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot z - 1 \cdot x) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot y - 1 \cdot x) = \begin{pmatrix} z - y \\ x - z \\ y - x \end{pmatrix}
\]
We know that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), so:
\[
z - y = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]
\[
x - z = -2 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
y - x = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

### Step 3: Solve the system of equations
We have the following system of linear equations:
1. \(x + y + z = 2\)
2. \(z - y = 1\)
3. \(x - z = -2\)
4. \(y - x = 1\)

From Equation 4, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
y = x + 1
\]

From Equation 3, we can express \(z\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
z = x + 2
\]

Substitute \(y = x + 1\) and \(z = x + 2\) into Equation 1:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 2
\]
\[
3x + 3 = 2
\]
\[
3x = -1
\]
\[
x = -\frac{1}{3}
\]

Now substitute \(x = -\frac{1}{3}\) back into the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\):
\[
y = -\frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
z = -\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Therefore, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is:

"To determine the measure of the angle \(\alpha\) in the given hexagon inscribed in a circle, we start by noting that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a hexagon, \(n = 6\), so the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
(6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
\]

The hexagon is inscribed in a circle, so each of its vertices lies on the circumference of the circle. The given angles are \(105^\circ\), \(110^\circ\), and the other four angles are unknown. Let's denote these unknown angles as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the interior angles as:

\[
105^\circ + 110^\circ + A + B + C + D = 720^\circ
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
215^\circ + A + B + C + D = 720^\circ
\]

Subtracting \(215^\circ\) from both sides, we obtain:

\[
A + B + C + D = 505^\circ
\]

Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, the opposite angles of the quadrilateral formed by any four consecutive vertices of the hexagon sum to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we can pair the angles as follows:

\[
A + C = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad B + D = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting these into the equation \(A + B + C + D = 505^\circ\), we get:

\[
180^\circ + B + 180^\circ = 505^\circ
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
360^\circ + B = 505^\circ
\]

Subtracting \(360^\circ\) from both sides, we find:

\[
B = 145^\circ
\]

Since \(B + D = 180^\circ\), we can find \(D\) as:

\[
D = 180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^\circ
\]

Now, we need to determine the measure of \(\alpha\). The angle \(\alpha\) is the angle subtended by the arc \(BC\) at the circumference of the circle. The central angle subtended by the same arc \(BC\) is \(180^\circ - \angle B - \angle C = 180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^\circ\). The measure of the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half of the measure of the central angle, so:

\[
\alpha = \frac{35^\circ}{2} = 17.5^\circ
\]

Therefore, the measure of \(\alpha\) is:

\[

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). This can be rewritten as:

\[x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}.\]

Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get:

\[x = \omega (1 - 13x),\]

where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). This can be rearranged to:

\[x + 13\omega x = \omega,\]

or

\[x(1 + 13\omega) = \omega.\]

Thus, the solutions are:

\[x = \frac{\omega}{1 + 13\omega}.\]

Since \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\), the 10th roots of \(-1\) are \(\omega = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\). Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

\[x = \frac{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 + 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}.\]

We are asked to find the value of:

\[\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3\overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4\overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]

For each root \(r_k = \frac{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 + 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}\), the complex conjugate \(\overline{r}_k\) is:

\[\overline{r}_k = \frac{e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 + 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}}.\]

The product \(r_k \overline{r}_k\) is:

\[r_k \overline{r}_k = \left( \frac{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 + 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}} \right) \left( \frac{e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}}{1 + 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}} \right) = \frac{1}{(1 + 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10})(1 + 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10})}.\]

Simplifying the denominator, we get:

\[(1 + 13e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10})(1 + 13e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/10}) = 1 + 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right) + 169.\]

Thus,

\[r_k \overline{r}_k = \frac{1}{170 + 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right)}.\]

Therefore,

\[\frac{1}{r_k \overline{r}_k} = 170 + 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right).\]

We need to find the sum:

\[\sum_{k=0}^{4} \left( 170 + 26\cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right) \right) = 5 \cdot 170 + 26 \sum_{k=0}^{4} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right).\]

The sum of cosines of equally spaced angles around a circle is zero, so:

\[\sum_{k=0}^{4} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)}{10}\right) = 0.\]

Thus, the sum is:

\[5 \cdot 170 + 26 \cdot 0 = 850.\]

First, let's find \(f(x)\):
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

Next, we need to find \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We are given that \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we have:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 1 - \lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2. \]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:
\[ x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0. \]

This equation has two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

Since we are looking for a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\), we discard \(x = 0\) and focus on the second case:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

\[ \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = 1. \]
\[ \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = 1. \]
\[ \frac{\lambda^2}{2} - \frac{\lambda^3}{8} = 1. \]
\[ 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8. \]
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0. \]

We need to find the roots of the polynomial \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\). Testing these values, we find:
\[ \lambda = 2 \implies 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0. \]

To confirm that this is the only value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) that satisfies the equation, we can use numerical methods or further analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can conclude that \(\lambda = 2\) is the only solution.

x^2 + 6x - y^2 + 16y - 46 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 - 9 - (y-8)^2 + 64 - 46 = 0 \implies (x+3)^2 - (y-8)^2 = 9.
\]
This is a hyperbola with center \((-3, 8)\), horizontal transverse axis, and \(a = 3\).

To find the points of intersection, we subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72) - (x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46) = 0 \implies 2y^2 - 40y + 118 = 0 \implies y^2 - 20y + 59 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
y = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 236}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{164}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm 2\sqrt{41}}{2} = 10 \pm \sqrt{41}.
\]
So, the \(y\)-coordinates of the intersection points are \(y_1 = 10 + \sqrt{41}\) and \(y_2 = 10 - \sqrt{41}\).

Next, we substitute these \(y\)-values back into the equation of the circle to find the corresponding \(x\)-coordinates. Using the circle equation \((x+3)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 81\):
For \(y_1 = 10 + \sqrt{41}\):
\[
(x+3)^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41} - 12)^2 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + (-2 + \sqrt{41})^2 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + 4 - 4\sqrt{41} + 41 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + 45 - 4\sqrt{41} = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 = 36 + 4\sqrt{41}.
\]
Thus, \(x+3 = \pm \sqrt{36 + 4\sqrt{41}} = \pm 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\), so \(x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}\).

For \(y_2 = 10 - \sqrt{41}\):
\[
(x+3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 12)^2 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + (-2 - \sqrt{41})^2 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + 4 + 4\sqrt{41} + 41 = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 + 45 + 4\sqrt{41} = 81 \implies (x+3)^2 = 36 - 4\sqrt{41}.
\]
Thus, \(x+3 = \pm \sqrt{36 - 4\sqrt{41}} = \pm 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}\), so \(x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}\).

The points of intersection are:
\[
\left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right), \left(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41}\right).
\]

We need to find the sum of the distances from the point \((-3, 2)\) to these points. The distance from \((-3, 2)\) to \((-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41})\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}} + 3)^2 + (10 + \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}})^2 + (8 + \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{4(9 + \sqrt{41}) + 64 + 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{109 + 20\sqrt{41}}.
\]
The distance from \((-3, 2)\) to \((-3 - 2\sqrt{9 + \sqrt{41}}, 10 + \sqrt{41})\) is:
\[

\]
The distance from \((-3, 2)\) to \((-3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41})\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-3 + 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}} + 3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}})^2 + (8 - \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{4(9 - \sqrt{41}) + 64 - 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}}.
\]
The distance from \((-3, 2)\) to \((-3 - 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}}, 10 - \sqrt{41})\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-3 - 2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}} + 3)^2 + (10 - \sqrt{41} - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-2\sqrt{9 - \sqrt{41}})^2 + (8 - \sqrt{41})^2} = \sqrt{4(9 - \sqrt{41}) + 64 - 16\sqrt{41} + 41} = \sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}}.
\]
The sum of these distances is:
\[
\sqrt{109 + 20\sqrt{41}} + \sqrt{109 + 20\sqrt{41}} + \sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}} + \sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}} = 2\sqrt{109 + 20\sqrt{41}} + 2\sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sqrt{a + b} + \sqrt{a - b} = \sqrt{2(a + \sqrt{a^2 - b^2})}\), we get:
\[
2\sqrt{109 + 20\sqrt{41}} + 2\sqrt{109 - 20\sqrt{41}} = 2\sqrt{2(109 + \sqrt{(109)^2 - (20\sqrt{41})^2})} = 2\sqrt{2(109 + \sqrt{11881 - 16400})} = 2\sqrt{2(109 + \sqrt{541})} = 2\sqrt{2(109 + 23)} = 2\sqrt{250} = 2 \cdot 5\sqrt{10} = 10\sqrt{10}.

"To determine the value of \( y \) for which the function \( y = \frac{4x^3 + 2x - 4}{3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1} \) has a horizontal asymptote, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( y = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials.

Here, the polynomial \( P(x) = 4x^3 + 2x - 4 \) has a degree of 3, and the polynomial \( Q(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \) also has a degree of 3.

"To determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than 0, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30.
2. Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than 0.
3. Find the intersection of these two sets.

First, let's list the prime numbers less than 30. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 30 are:
\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\]

Next, let's list the odd numbers greater than 0. An odd number is a natural number that is not divisible by 2. The first few odd numbers greater than 0 are:
\[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, \ldots\]

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of all numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, the odd ones are:
\[3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\]

We can see that these are all the odd prime numbers less than 30. Therefore, the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than 0 is:
\[\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}\]

"To solve for the value of \( k \) given the conditions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the foci of the ellipse:**
   The equation of the ellipse is given by \( kx^2 + y^2 = 1 \). This can be rewritten in the standard form of an ellipse:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{\frac{1}{k}} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1
   \]
   Here, \( a^2 = \frac{1}{k} \) and \( b^2 = 1 \). Since \( k > 1 \), we have \( a^2 < b^2 \), so the major axis is along the \( y \)-axis. The foci of the ellipse are located at \( (0, \pm c) \), where \( c = \sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} \). Therefore, the foci are \( F_1 = \left(0, -\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}}\right) \) and \( F_2 = \left(0, \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}}\right) \).

2. **Equation of the circle:**
   The circle passes through \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) and is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the \( x \)-axis. Since the circle is symmetric about the \( y \)-axis and passes through the foci, its center must be on the \( y \)-axis. Let the center of the circle be \( (0, h) \) and the radius be \( r \). The equation of the circle is:
   \[
   x^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2
   \]
   Since the circle passes through the foci, we have:
   \[
   0^2 + \left(-\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} - h\right)^2 = r^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 0^2 + \left(\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} - h\right)^2 = r^2
   \]
   Simplifying these, we get:
   \[
   \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} + 2h\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} + h^2\right) = r^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} - 2h\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} + h^2\right) = r^2
   \]
   Adding these two equations, we eliminate \( h\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} \):
   \[
   2\left(1 - \frac{1}{k} + h^2\right) = 2r^2 \implies r^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{k} + h^2
   \]
   Subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate \( 1 - \frac{1}{k} + h^2 \):
   \[
   4h\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{k}} = 0 \implies h = 0
   \]
   So, the center of the circle is at \( (0, 0) \) and the radius is:
   \[
   r^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{k}
   \]
   The circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the \( x \)-axis, so the radius \( r \) is equal to the semi-major axis of the ellipse, which is \( b = 1 \). Therefore:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{k} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{k} = 0 \implies k = 2

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression. The given expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we get:

\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ.
\]

So, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) with \(A = 65^\circ\) and \(B = 5^\circ\):

\[
\tan 65^\circ = \frac{\sin 65^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan 5^\circ = \frac{\sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ}.

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\tan 65^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 65^\circ \tan 5^\circ} = \tan 70^\circ.

First, let's express the terms in terms of the initial terms and the common ratios and differences. Let \(a_1 = a\) and \(a_2 = b\).

For the subsequence \(a_1, a_2, a_3\):
- Since \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) is geometric, we have \(a_3 = \frac{b^2}{a}\).

For the subsequence \(a_2, a_3, a_4\):
- Since \(a_2, a_3, a_4\) is arithmetic, we have \(a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2 \cdot \frac{b^2}{a} - b = \frac{2b^2 - ab}{a}\).

For the subsequence \(a_3, a_4, a_5\):
- Since \(a_3, a_4, a_5\) is geometric, we have \(a_5 = \frac{a_4^2}{a_3} = \frac{\left(\frac{2b^2 - ab}{a}\right)^2}{\frac{b^2}{a}} = \frac{(2b^2 - ab)^2}{ab^2}\).

For the subsequence \(a_4, a_5, a_6\):
- Since \(a_4, a_5, a_6\) is arithmetic, we have \(a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 = 2 \cdot \frac{(2b^2 - ab)^2}{ab^2} - \frac{2b^2 - ab}{a}\).

We can observe a pattern in the sequence. To find a general formula, let's consider the even-indexed terms. For the subsequence \(a_2, a_4, a_6\):
- Since \(a_2, a_4, a_6\) is arithmetic, we have \(a_6 = 2a_4 - a_2 = 2 \cdot \frac{2b^2 - ab}{a} - b = \frac{4b^2 - 2ab - ab}{a} = \frac{4b^2 - 3ab}{a}\).

For the subsequence \(a_4, a_6, a_8\):
- Since \(a_4, a_6, a_8\) is arithmetic, we have \(a_8 = 2a_6 - a_4 = 2 \cdot \frac{4b^2 - 3ab}{a} - \frac{2b^2 - ab}{a} = \frac{8b^2 - 6ab - 2b^2 + ab}{a} = \frac{6b^2 - 5ab}{a}\).

We can see that the even-indexed terms form a geometric sequence with the first term \(a_2 = b\) and common ratio \(\frac{2b - a}{a}\). Therefore, the general term for the even-indexed terms is:
\[a_{2n} = b \left(\frac{2b - a}{a}\right)^{n-1}.\]

For the odd-indexed terms, we can use the fact that \(a_{2k+1} = \frac{a_{2k}^2}{a_{2k-1}}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6. Therefore, \(a_{13} = a_1\).

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 erkek from 7 erkek. This is denoted as \( \binom{7}{3} \):

\[

First, we simplify the denominator. The denominator is a difference of squares:

So the expression simplifies to:

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:

\[
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23
\]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[
Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
(C+D)x + (8C-3D) = 4x - 23
\]

For the equation to hold for all \(x\), the coefficients of \(x\) and the constant terms on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:

\[
C + D = 4
\]
\[
8C - 3D = -23
\]

We can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 3:

\[
3C + 3D = 12
\]

Next, we add this equation to the second equation:

\[
(3C + 3D) + (8C - 3D) = 12 + (-23)
\]
\[
11C = -11
\]
\[
C = -1
\]

Now that we have \(C = -1\), we substitute this value back into the first equation:

\[
-1 + D = 4
\]
\[
D = 5
\]

Thus, the values of \(C\) and \(D\) are \(C = -1\) and \(D = 5\). The product \(CD\) is:

\[
CD = (-1)(5) = -5

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""E"" appears twice and the letter ""L"" appears twice.

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 7 letters: E, L, L, E, P, S, E. Here, we have:
- 2 E's
- 2 L's
- 1 P
- 1 S
- 1 S

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 7 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 2 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for P)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for S)
- \( n_5 = 1 \) (for S)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

Now, substitute these values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct permutations of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{1260}\).","[1260, '1260']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True
"To solve the equation \(2^{2x} = 256^{\frac{1}{2}}\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Let's start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation.

First, we know that \(256\) can be written as a power of 2. Specifically, \(256 = 2^8\). Therefore, we can rewrite the right-hand side as follows:
\[
256^{\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can simplify the right-hand side:
\[
(2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^4.
\]
Now our equation looks like this:
\[
2^{2x} = 2^4.
\]
Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[
2x = 4.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{4}{2} = 2.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt{3x-5}=2\) for \(x\), we need to eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[

   \]

2. Square both sides to remove the square root:
   \[
   (\sqrt{3x-5})^2=2^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x-5=4
   \]

3. Next, isolate the term with \(x\) by adding 5 to both sides:
   \[
   3x-5+5=4+5
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3x=9

4. Finally, solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   x=\frac{9}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x=3
   \]

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(x=3\) back into the original equation and check if it holds true:
\[
\sqrt{3(3)-5}=\sqrt{9-5}=\sqrt{4}=2

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

"To solve the problem, we start with the inequality \( |a + bi| \le 5 \). The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by the formula:

So, the inequality becomes:

4. If \(a = 2\), then \(b^2 \le 21\), so \(b\) can be \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us the pairs \((2, -4), (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)\).

"To determine whether the function \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is even, odd, or neither, we need to analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \( x \to -x \). Specifically, we need to evaluate \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \) and compare it to \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \).

Given that \( f(x) \) is an odd function and \( g(x) \) is an even function, we know the following properties:
- For an odd function \( f(x) \), \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).
- For an even function \( g(x) \), \( g(-x) = g(x) \).

Let's start by evaluating \( f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \):
1. Since \( g(x) \) is even, \( g(f(-x)) = g(f(x)) \).
2. Therefore, \( f(g(f(-x))) = f(g(f(x))) \).
3. Since \( f(x) \) is odd, \( f(g(f(x))) = -f(g(f(x))) \).

The denominators are 2 and 3, and their least common multiple is 6. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6.

First, we convert \(\frac{x}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{x \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{3x}{6}

Next, we convert \(\frac{x}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = \frac{x \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{2x}{6}

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

6 \cdot \frac{5x}{6} = 5 \cdot 6

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of inverse proportionality. If the popularity of the televizion (measured by the number of customers) is inversely proportional to the cost, then the product of the number of customers and the cost will be a constant.

Let's denote the number of customers by \( n \) and the cost by \( c \). According to the problem, the cost is inversely proportional to the number of customers, so we can write:
\[ n \cdot c = k \]
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

We are given that if Daniel buys a $1500 televizion, he can buy 15 customers. Therefore, we can find the constant \( k \) as follows:
\[ 15 \cdot 1500 = k \]
\[ k = 22500 \]

Now, we need to find out how many customers Daniel can buy if he buys a $2500 televizion. Let's denote the number of customers in this case by \( n' \). Using the same constant \( k \), we can write:
\[ n' \cdot 2500 = 22500 \]
To find \( n' \), we solve for \( n' \):
\[ n' = \frac{22500}{2500} \]
\[ n' = 9 \]

Therefore, if Daniel buys a $2500 televizion, he can buy \(\boxed{9}\) customers.","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the area of the quadrilateral \(DBEF\), we first need to determine the coordinates of points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).

1. **Find the coordinates of point \(D\):**
   Point \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\). Since \(A = (0, 6)\) and \(B = (0, 0)\), the coordinates of \(D\) are:
   \[
   D = \left( \frac{0+0}{2}, \frac{6+0}{2} \right) = (0, 3)
   \]

2. **Find the coordinates of point \(E\):**
   Point \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\). Since \(B = (0, 0)\) and \(C = (8, 0)\), the coordinates of \(E\) are:
   \[
   E = \left( \frac{0+8}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2} \right) = (4, 0)
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of point \(F\):**
   Point \(F\) is the intersection of the lines \(AE\) and \(CD\). First, we find the equations of lines \(AE\) and \(CD\).

   - The slope of line \(AE\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } AE = \frac{6-0}{0-4} = -\frac{3}{2}
     \]
     The equation of line \(AE\) in point-slope form is:
     \[
     y - 0 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 4) \implies y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6
     \]

   - The slope of line \(CD\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } CD = \frac{3-0}{0-8} = -\frac{3}{8}
     \]
     The equation of line \(CD\) in point-slope form is:
     \[
     y - 0 = -\frac{3}{8}(x - 8) \implies y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
     \]

   To find the intersection point \(F\), we set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   -\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   6 - 3 = -\frac{3}{8}x + \frac{3}{2}x \implies 3 = \frac{9}{8}x \implies x = \frac{3 \cdot 8}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   Substituting \(x = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6\):
   \[
   y = -\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) + 6 = -4 + 6 = 2

   Therefore, the coordinates of \(F\) are:
   \[

   The area of a quadrilateral with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4)\) can be found using the Shoelace Theorem:

   Substituting the coordinates of \(D\), \(B\), \(E\), and \(F\):

"To solve the equation \( |x+5| - |3x-6| = 0 \), we need to consider the different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. These critical points are \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 2 \). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

**Case 1: \( x < -5 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 < 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
-(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0 \implies -x - 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \implies 2x - 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
However, \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) is not in the interval \( (-\infty, -5) \), so there is no solution in this interval.

**Case 2: \( -5 \le x < 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 < 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
(x+5) - (-(3x-6)) = 0 \implies x + 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \implies 4x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) is in the interval \( [-5, 2) \), it is a solution.

**Case 3: \( x \ge 2 \)**

In this interval, \( x+5 \ge 0 \) and \( 3x-6 \ge 0 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
(x+5) - (3x-6) = 0 \implies x + 5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \implies -2x + 11 = 0 \implies x = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Since \( x = \frac{11}{2} \) is in the interval \( [2, \infty) \), it is a solution.

The solutions to the equation are \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = \frac{11}{2} \). The largest of these solutions is \( \frac{11}{2} \).

"To evaluate the expression \(\lceil (3.6)^2 \rceil - ( \lceil 3.6 \rceil ) ^2\), we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we calculate \((3.6)^2\):
\[

\]
Next, we apply the ceiling function to 12.96. The ceiling function, denoted by \(\lceil x \rceil\), is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\). Therefore,
\[
\lceil 12.96 \rceil = 13

So, the first part of the expression \(\lceil (3.6)^2 \rceil\) is 13.

Next, we square this value:

"To solve for \( z_{2002} \) given the function \( F(z) = \frac{z+i}{z-i} \) and the initial condition \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), we need to understand the behavior of the sequence \( z_n \) defined by \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) \).

First, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns.

Starting with \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), we find \( z_1 \) as follows:
\[
z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) + i}{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) - i} = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 274i.
\]

Next, we find \( z_2 \):
\[
z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{(1 + 274i) + i}{(1 + 274i) - i} = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i}.
\]
To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z_2 = \frac{(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 275 \cdot 273i^2}{1 - 273^2i^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 275 \cdot 273}{1 + 273^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + 74625}{1 + 74529} = \frac{74626 + 2i}{74530} = \frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265}.
\]

Now, we find \( z_3 \):
\[
z_3 = F(z_2) = \frac{\left( \frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265} \right) + i}{\left( \frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265} \right) - i} = \frac{\frac{37313 + 37266i}{37265}}{\frac{37313 - 37264i}{37265}} = \frac{37313 + 37266i}{37313 - 37264i}.
\]
Again, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z_3 = \frac{(37313 + 37266i)(37313 - 37264i)}{(37313 - 37264i)(37313 - 37264i)} = \frac{37313^2 - 37313 \cdot 37264i + 37266i \cdot 37313 - 37266i \cdot 37264i^2}{37313^2 - 2 \cdot 37313 \cdot 37264i + 37264^2i^2} = \frac{37313^2 + 37266^2}{37313^2 + 37264^2} + \frac{(37313^2 - 37266^2) - 37313 \cdot 37264 - 37266 \cdot 37313}{37313^2 + 37264^2}i.
\]
Since \( 37313^2 + 37266^2 = 37313^2 + 37264^2 \), the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is 0. Therefore, \( z_3 = 1 \).

Now, we find \( z_4 \):
\[
z_4 = F(z_3) = F(1) = \frac{1 + i}{1 - i} = \frac{(1 + i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{1 + 2i + i^2}{1 - i^2} = \frac{1 + 2i - 1}{1 + 1} = \frac{2i}{2} = i.
\]

Next, we find \( z_5 \):
\[
z_5 = F(z_4) = F(i) = \frac{i + i}{i - i} = \frac{2i}{0},
\]
which is undefined. However, we can see that the sequence is periodic with a period of 4 starting from \( z_3 \). Therefore, \( z_6 = z_2 \), \( z_7 = z_3 \), \( z_8 = z_4 \), and so on.

Since \( 2002 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), we have \( z_{2002} = z_2 = \frac{37313}{37265} + \frac{i}{37265} \).

"To convert the decimal number \(555_{10}\) to a base-5 number, we need to repeatedly divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will form the digits of the base-5 number, read from bottom to top.

Here are the steps:

1. Divide 555 by 5.
   \[
   555 \div 5 = 111 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0

   So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 0.

2. Divide 111 by 5.

"To find the area of triangle \(ACD\), we first need to determine the length of the altitude from vertex \(C\) to side \(AB\). Let's denote this altitude by \(h\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) can be calculated using Heron's formula. First, we find the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{17 + 8 + 15}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{20(20-17)(20-8)(20-15)} = \sqrt{20 \cdot 3 \cdot 12 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{3600} = 60
\]

The area of triangle \(ABC\) can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times h

Setting the two expressions for the area equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times h = 60 \implies 17h = 120 \implies h = \frac{120}{17}
\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(AD\). Since \(D\) is the foot of the altitude from \(C\) to \(AB\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \(ACD\) and \(BCD\).

First, in triangle \(ACD\):
\[
AC^2 = AD^2 + h^2 \implies 8^2 = AD^2 + \left(\frac{120}{17}\right)^2 \implies 64 = AD^2 + \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = 64 - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{18496}{289} - \frac{14400}{289} \implies AD^2 = \frac{4096}{289} \implies AD = \frac{64}{17}

This can be done by first finding the remainder when 11213141 is divided by 18 and then using the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, we perform the division of 11213141 by 18:
\[ 11213141 \div 18 = 622952.2777\ldots \]
The integer part of the quotient is 622952. Now, we multiply this integer by 18 to find the product:
\[ 622952 \times 18 = 11213136 \]
Next, we subtract this product from 11213141 to find the remainder:

Simplify the expression:

\[
f(-3) = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 2

We know that \( f(-3) = 2 \), so we can set up the equation:

\[
81a - 9b + 2 = 2

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[

Factor out the common term \( 9 \) on the left side:

\[
9(9a - b) = 0

Divide both sides by 9:

Simplify the expression:

We know that \( b = 9a \), so substitute \( b \) with \( 9a \):

The foci of the hyperbola are \( F_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( F_2 = (-16, 2) \). The condition given is \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \). This means that the distance between the points \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) is \( 2c \), where \( c \) is the distance from the center to each focus. Therefore, we have:
\[ 2c = 10 - (-16) = 26 \implies c = 13. \]

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment joining the foci. The coordinates of the center are:
\[ \left( \frac{10 + (-16)}{2}, \frac{2 + 2}{2} \right) = (-3, 2). \]
So, \( h = -3 \) and \( k = 2 \).

For a hyperbola, the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We know \( c = 13 \), and the condition \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \) tells us that \( 2a = 24 \implies a = 12 \). Therefore, we can find \( b \) as follows:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \implies 13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5. \]

The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis is:

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the first 42 positive integers. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the sum of all possible values of \( n \) for the given conditions, we start by analyzing the given equations:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216.
\]

First, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \),

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n 1^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \right)^2.
\]

Substituting the given values, we get

\[
144 \cdot n \geq 96^2.
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have

\[
144n \geq 9216 \implies n \geq 64.
\]

Next, we use the Power Mean Inequality, which states that for any positive real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \),

\[
\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n}.
\]

Substituting the given values, we get

\[
\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \frac{96}{n}.
\]

We start with the rightmost inequality:

\[
\frac{96}{n} \leq \left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides, we get

\[
\frac{96^3}{n^3} \leq \frac{216}{n} \implies \frac{884736}{n^3} \leq \frac{216}{n} \implies 884736 \leq 216n^2 \implies 4116 \leq n^2 \implies n \geq \sqrt{4116} \approx 64.16.
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have \( n \geq 65 \).

Now, we check the other inequality:

\[
\left( \frac{216}{n} \right)^{1/3} \geq \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2}.
\]

Cubing both sides, we get

\[
\frac{216}{n} \geq \frac{144}{n} \implies 216 \geq 144,
\]

which is true for all \( n > 0 \). Therefore, the only constraint is \( n \geq 65 \).

To verify if \( n = 65 \) is a valid solution, we assume \( a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_{65} = a \). Then,

\[
65a = 96 \implies a = \frac{96}{65},
\]

\[
65a^2 = 144 \implies 65 \left( \frac{96}{65} \right)^2 = 144 \implies 65 \cdot \frac{9216}{4225} = 144 \implies \frac{599040}{4225} = 144 \implies 144 = 144,
\]

\[
65a^3 = 216 \implies 65 \left( \frac{96}{65} \right)^3 = 216 \implies 65 \cdot \frac{884736}{274625} = 216 \implies \frac{57552480}{274625} = 216 \implies 216 = 216.

"To solve the problem of dividing \(413_5\) by \(2_5\) and finding the quotient in base 5, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert the base 5 number \(413_5\) to a base 10 number.
2. Divide the base 10 equivalent by the base 10 equivalent of \(2_5\).
3. Convert the quotient back to base 5.

**Step 1: Convert \(413_5\) to base 10.**

The base 5 number \(413_5\) can be expanded as follows:
\[413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[4 \cdot 5^2 = 4 \cdot 25 = 100,\]
\[1 \cdot 5^1 = 1 \cdot 5 = 5,\]
\[3 \cdot 5^0 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[100 + 5 + 3 = 108.\]

So, \(413_5\) in base 10 is \(108\).

**Step 2: Divide the base 10 equivalent by the base 10 equivalent of \(2_5\).**

The base 5 number \(2_5\) is the same as \(2\) in base 10. Therefore, we need to divide \(108\) by \(2\):
\[108 \div 2 = 54.\]

**Step 3: Convert the quotient back to base 5.**

To convert \(54\) from base 10 to base 5, we repeatedly divide by 5 and keep track of the remainders:
\[54 \div 5 = 10 \text{ remainder } 4,\]
\[10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ remainder } 0,\]
\[2 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 2.\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(204_5\).

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the maximum value is achieved when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the maximum value of \(\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\), we start by letting \(d = \gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\). This means that \(d\) divides both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\). Consequently, \(d\) must also divide any linear combination of \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\). Specifically, we can consider the expression:

\[
2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 2n + 14 - 2n - 1 = 13
\]

Since \(d\) divides both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\), it must also divide their difference, which is 13. Therefore, \(d\) must be a divisor of 13. The divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. The maximum value of \(d\) is 13.

To verify that \(d = 13\) is indeed possible, we need to find an integer \(n\) such that both \(n + 7\) and \(2n + 1\) are divisible by 13. Let's set \(n + 7 = 13k\) for some integer \(k\). Then:

\[
n = 13k - 7

Substituting \(n = 13k - 7\) into \(2n + 1\), we get:

\[
2n + 1 = 2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13(2k - 1)

Since \(2n + 1 = 13(2k - 1)\), it is clear that \(2n + 1\) is also divisible by 13. Therefore, when \(n = 13k - 7\), \(\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13\).

   - Each of the 300 kalem must be placed in one of the 300 boxes.
   - Each of the 300 boxes must contain the same number of kalem.

2. **Determine the number of kalem per box:**

"To determine the number of different ways the members of each party can line up in a circle, we need to consider the properties of circular permutations. In a circular arrangement, one position is fixed to account for rotational symmetry, and then the remaining members are arranged in the remaining positions.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the members of each party in a line:**
   - For the Demokrat party, there are 5 members, so the number of ways to arrange them in a line is \(5!\).
   - For the Cumhuriyetçi party, there are 5 members, so the number of ways to arrange them in a line is \(5!\).
   - For the Bağımsız party, there is only 1 member, so the number of ways to arrange them in a line is \(1!\).

2. **Combine the arrangements of the members of all three parties:**
   - Since the arrangement of the members of each party is independent of the others, we multiply the number of arrangements for each party together.
   - Therefore, the total number of different ways to arrange the members in a circle is \(5! \times 5! \times 1!\).

3. **Calculate the value:**
   - \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
   - So, \(5! \times 5! \times 1! = 120 \times 120 \times 1 = 14400\).

We can express \( z \) in exponential form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, the given equation becomes:
\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \alpha. \]
Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the property of the golden ratio that \( \alpha^2 = \alpha + 1 \). This implies that \( \alpha \) is a root of the polynomial \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \). The powers of \( \alpha \) can be expressed in terms of \( \alpha \) and 1. Specifically, we have:

The golden ratio has a property that \( \alpha^5 = -1 \), which implies that \( \alpha^{85} = (\alpha^5)^{17} = (-1)^{17} = -1 \). Therefore, \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(17\pi) = -1 \).

Thus,

First, we rewrite the expression as:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]

We will apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), and \(2y^2\), and \(z^4\), \(z^4\), and \(z^4\):
\[x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4 \geq 6 \sqrt[6]{x^4 \cdot (2y^2)^2 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4} = 6 \sqrt[6]{4x^4 y^4 z^4}.\]

Since \(xyz = 2\), we have \(x^4 y^4 z^4 = (xyz)^4 = 2^4 = 16\). Substituting this into the inequality, we get:
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 6 \sqrt[6]{4 \cdot 16} = 6 \sqrt[6]{64} = 6 \cdot 2 = 12.\]

To check if this minimum value is achievable, we need to see if the equality condition of the AM-GM inequality holds. The equality condition for AM-GM is that all the terms must be equal. Therefore, we need:
\[x^4 = 2y^2 = 2z^4.\]

Let \(x^4 = k\), \(2y^2 = k\), and \(2z^4 = k\). Then \(y^2 = \frac{k}{2}\) and \(z^4 = \frac{k}{2}\). From \(xyz = 2\), we have:
\[x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}} \cdot \sqrt[4]{\frac{k}{2}} = 2.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}} \cdot \sqrt[4]{\frac{k}{2}} = x \cdot \left(\frac{k}{2}\right)^{3/4} = 2.\]

Since \(x^4 = k\), we have \(x = k^{1/4}\). Substituting \(x = k^{1/4}\) into the equation, we get:
\[k^{1/4} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{2}\right)^{3/4} = 2.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[k^{1/4} \cdot \frac{k^{3/4}}{2^{3/4}} = \frac{k}{2^{3/4}} = 2.\]

Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[k = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{7/4}.\]

Therefore, \(x = k^{1/4} = (2^{7/4})^{1/4} = 2^{7/16}\), \(y^2 = \frac{k}{2} = \frac{2^{7/4}}{2} = 2^{3/4}\), and \(z^4 = \frac{k}{2} = \frac{2^{7/4}}{2} = 2^{3/4}\). So, \(y = 2^{3/8}\) and \(z = 2^{3/8}\).

"To determine Rosa's age, we need to find a number that meets the following conditions:
1. When divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1.
2. When divided by 7, the remainder is 0.
3. The number is less than 75.

First, let's express the first condition mathematically. If Rosa's age is \( x \), then:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \]
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \]

This means that \( x - 1 \) is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. Therefore, \( x - 1 \) must be a multiple of 12, which can be written as:
\[ x - 1 = 12k \]
for some integer \( k \). This simplifies to:
\[ x = 12k + 1 \]

Next, we use the second condition, which states that \( x \) is divisible by 7:
\[ x \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

Substituting \( x = 12k + 1 \) into this congruence, we get:
\[ 12k + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 12k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ 5k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

To solve for \( k \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is a number \( y \) such that:
\[ 5y \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

We can test the values of \( y \) from 1 to 6:
\[ 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, the inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3. Multiplying both sides of the congruence \( 5k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) by 3, we get:
\[ k \equiv 18 \pmod{7} \]
\[ k \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

This means that \( k \) can be written as:
\[ k = 7m + 4 \]
for some integer \( m \). Substituting this back into the expression for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 12(7m + 4) + 1 \]
\[ x = 84m + 49 \]

Since \( x \) must be less than 75, we set \( m = 0 \):
\[ x = 49 \]

"To find \( f(2015, 2) \), we need to understand the recursive definition of the function \( f \):

\[ f(i, j) = \begin{cases} 
\text{mod}_5 (j+1) & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ and } 0 \le j \le 4, \\ 
f(i-1, 1) & \text{if } i \ge 1 \text{ and } j = 0, \\ 
f(i-1, f(i, j-1)) & \text{if } i \ge 1 \text{ and } 1 \le j \le 4. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's compute the base case for \( i = 0 \):
\[ f(0, j) = \text{mod}_5 (j+1). \]
So, we have:
\[ f(0, 0) = \text{mod}_5 (0+1) = 1, \]
\[ f(0, 1) = \text{mod}_5 (1+1) = 2, \]
\[ f(0, 2) = \text{mod}_5 (2+1) = 3, \]
\[ f(0, 3) = \text{mod}_5 (3+1) = 4, \]
\[ f(0, 4) = \text{mod}_5 (4+1) = 0. \]

Now, let's use the recursive definition to find \( f(1, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
\[ f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2, \]
\[ f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 3, \]
\[ f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0, 4) = 0, \]
\[ f(1, 4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0, 0) = 1. \]

Next, let's find \( f(2, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
\[ f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3, \]
\[ f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) = f(1, 3) = 4, \]
\[ f(2, 2) = f(1, f(2, 1)) = f(1, 4) = 0, \]
\[ f(2, 3) = f(1, f(2, 2)) = f(1, 0) = 2, \]
\[ f(2, 4) = f(1, f(2, 3)) = f(1, 2) = 3. \]

We observe a pattern in the values of \( f(2, j) \). Let's generalize this pattern. From the above calculations, we can see that:
\[ f(2, j) = \begin{cases} 
3 & \text{if } j = 0, \\ 
4 & \text{if } j = 1, \\ 
0 & \text{if } j = 2, \\ 
2 & \text{if } j = 3, \\ 
3 & \text{if } j = 4. 
\end{cases} \]

We can see that the sequence repeats every 5 values. Therefore, we can write:
\[ f(2, j) = \begin{cases} 
3 & \text{if } j \equiv 0 \pmod{5}, \\ 
4 & \text{if } j \equiv 1 \pmod{5}, \\ 
0 & \text{if } j \equiv 2 \pmod{5}, \\ 
2 & \text{if } j \equiv 3 \pmod{5}, \\ 
3 & \text{if } j \equiv 4 \pmod{5}. 
\end{cases} \]

Now, we need to find \( f(2015, 2) \). Since \( 2015 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), we have:
\[ f(2015, 2) = 3. \]

"To find the value of \(\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2\), we start by defining the determinant of the matrix as follows:
\[
D = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}.
\]
The square of the determinant is then:
\[
D^2 = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2.
\]
The determinant \(D\) can be expressed in terms of the squared distances between the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\). The squared distance between two points \((x_i, y_i)\) and \((x_j, y_j)\) is given by:
\[
(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2.
\]
We are given the following squared distances:
\[
(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 9,
\]
\[
(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2 = 16,
\]
\[
(x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2 = 25.
\]
These distances correspond to the lengths of the sides of a triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5. Since \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\), the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle between the sides of lengths 3 and 4, and the hypotenuse of length 5.
The area \(A\) of a right triangle can be calculated as:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6.
\]
The area of a triangle can also be expressed in terms of its sides and the determinant of the matrix formed by its vertices:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| D^2 \right|.
\]
Since the area \(A\) is 6, we have:
\[
6 = \frac{1}{2} \left| D^2 \right| \implies \left| D^2 \right| = 12 \implies D^2 = 12.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2\) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(MNC\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Since \(G\) is the centroid, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the sides. Specifically, since \(AG:AD = 2:3\) (where \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\)), the ratio of the sides of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

Since \(MN \parallel BC\), the area of triangle \(MNC\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):

"To determine the probability that three randomly selected points from a 3x3 grid lie on the same line, we first need to identify the total number of ways to choose three points from the grid and then count the number of ways to choose three points that lie on the same line.

The grid consists of 9 points, and the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 9 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{9}{3} \):
\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84

Next, we need to count the number of ways to choose three points that lie on the same line. In a 3x3 grid, there are 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal) that each contain 3 points. Therefore, there are a total of \( 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 \) sets of three points that lie on the same line.

The probability that three randomly selected points lie on the same line is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

"To determine the shortest path for the pigeon to reach the sine, we need to consider the coordinates of the pigeon's starting point, the sine, and the two possible paths it can take. Let's denote the pigeon's starting point as \( A = (0, 0) \), the sine as \( S = (12, 8) \), the first target as \( T_1 = (10, 8) \), and the second target as \( T_2 = (10, 0) \).

The pigeon can take one of two paths:
1. From \( A \) to \( T_1 \) and then from \( T_1 \) to \( S \).
2. From \( A \) to \( T_2 \) and then from \( T_2 \) to \( S \).

We need to calculate the total distance for each path and then choose the shorter one.

**Path 1: \( A \to T_1 \to S \)**

The distance from \( A \) to \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(10-0)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{100 + 64} = \sqrt{164} = 2\sqrt{41}

The distance from \( T_1 \) to \( S \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(12-10)^2 + (8-8)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

The total distance for Path 1 is:
\[
2\sqrt{41} + 2
\]

**Path 2: \( A \to T_2 \to S \)**

The distance from \( A \) to \( T_2 \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(10-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]

The distance from \( T_2 \) to \( S \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(12-10)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{4 + 64} = \sqrt{68} = 2\sqrt{17}
\]

The total distance for Path 2 is:
\[
10 + 2\sqrt{17}
\]

To determine which path is shorter, we compare \( 2\sqrt{41} + 2 \) and \( 10 + 2\sqrt{17} \).

First, we approximate the values of the square roots:
\[
\sqrt{41} \approx 6.403 \quad \text{so} \quad 2\sqrt{41} \approx 2 \times 6.403 = 12.806
\]
\[
\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123 \quad \text{so} \quad 2\sqrt{17} \approx 2 \times 4.123 = 8.246
\]

Now, we calculate the total distances:
\[
2\sqrt{41} + 2 \approx 12.806 + 2 = 14.806
\]
\[
10 + 2\sqrt{17} \approx 10 + 8.246 = 18.246

   The region is a rectangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((8,0)\), \((8,4)\), and \((0,4)\). The area of this rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = 8 \times 4 = 32

2. **Identify the area of the region where \(x + y \le 4\):**
   The inequality \(x + y \le 4\) describes a region below the line \(x + y = 4\). This line intersects the x-axis at \(x = 4\) (when \(y = 0\)) and the y-axis at \(y = 4\) (when \(x = 0\)).

Let \(P\) be at \((0, h)\). The distances \(PA\) and \(PB\) can be expressed as:
\[
PA = \sqrt{a^2 + h^2}

First, we compute the derivatives:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{h}{\sqrt{a^2 + h^2}} \right) = h \cdot \frac{-h}{(a^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \cdot 0 = 0

Since the derivatives are zero, we need to use the fact that \(P\) is directly above \(O\) and the angles are formed by the horizontal line \(AB\) and the line segments \(PA\) and \(PB\). The maximum angle \(\angle APB\) occurs when \(P\) is at the point where the line segment \(AB\) is tangent to the circle with center \(O\) and radius \(h\).

Using the fact that the maximum angle is formed when the line segment \(AB\) is tangent to the circle, we can use the property of similar triangles. The maximum angle \(\angle APB\) is given by:
\[

1. **Find the smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100:**
   \[
   \frac{100}{7} \approx 14.2857
   \]
   Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 15.
   \[
   15 \times 7 = 105
   \]
   So, the smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100 is 105.

2. **Find the largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200:**
   \[
   \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.5714
   \]
   Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we get 28.
   \[
   28 \times 7 = 196
   \]
   So, the largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200 is 196.

3. **List all the multiples of 7 from 105 to 196:**
   The multiples of 7 form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 105, the common difference \(d\) is 7, and the last term \(a_n\) is 196. The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   196 = 105 + (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   196 - 105 = (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   \[
   91 = (n-1) \cdot 7
   \]
   \[
   n-1 = \frac{91}{7}
   \]
   \[
   n-1 = 13

   \[
   n = 14

   So, there are 14 terms in this arithmetic sequence.

   The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S = \frac{14}{2} (105 + 196)
   \]
   \[
   S = 7 \cdot 301

   \[
   S = 2107

"To convert the quadratic expression \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\) into the form \((x + b)^2 + c\), we need to complete the square. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the expression: \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\).
2. Focus on the first two terms, \(x^2 + 2.6x\). To complete the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \(x\). The coefficient of \(x\) is 2.6, so half of it is 1.3, and the square of 1.3 is 1.69.
3. Add and subtract 1.69 inside the expression: \(x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 - 1.69 + 3.6\).
4. Group the perfect square trinomial and the constants: \((x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + (3.6 - 1.69)\).
5. The expression \(x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69\) is a perfect square trinomial and can be written as \((x + 1.3)^2\). So, the expression becomes \((x + 1.3)^2 + (3.6 - 1.69)\).
6. Simplify the constant term: \(3.6 - 1.69 = 1.91\).

Therefore, the expression \(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\) in the form \((x + b)^2 + c\) is \((x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91\). Here, \(b = 1.3\) and \(c = 1.91\).

To find \(b + c\), we add these values together: \(1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21\).

Thus, the value of \(b + c\) is \(\boxed{3.21}\).","[3.21000000000000, '3.21']",3.21,"[3.21000000000000, '3.21']",True
"To find the two consecutive positive even integers whose product is 288, we can let the two integers be \( x \) and \( x+2 \). According to the problem, their product is 288, so we can write the equation:

\[ x(x+2) = 288 \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ x^2 + 2x = 288 \]

To form a standard quadratic equation, we need to move 288 to the left side:

\[ x^2 + 2x - 288 = 0 \]

Next, we need to factor this quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-288\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(18\) and \(-16\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[ (x + 18)(x - 16) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for \( x \):

\[ x + 18 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 16 = 0 \]
\[ x = -18 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 16 \]

Since we are looking for positive integers, we discard \( x = -18 \) and take \( x = 16 \). The next consecutive even integer is \( x + 2 = 18 \). Therefore, the two consecutive positive even integers are \( 16 \) and \( 18 \).

The larger of these two integers is \( 18 \). Thus, the answer is:

\[64 = 2^6\]

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation \(2^x = 64\) as:

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected number from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) is divisible by 2 but not by 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of elements in the set:**
   The set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) contains 100 elements.

2. **Count the number of elements divisible by 2:**
   A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. The even numbers in the set are \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 100\). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\). The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a + (n-1)d
   \]
   Setting \(a_n = 100\), we solve for \(n\):
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies 100 = 2 + 2n - 2 \implies 100 = 2n \implies n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers in the set.

3. **Count the number of elements divisible by 6:**
   A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. The numbers in the set that are divisible by 6 are \(6, 12, 18, \ldots, 96, 102\). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 6\) and the common difference \(d = 6\). The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a + (n-1)d
   \]
   Setting \(a_n = 96\), we solve for \(n\):
   \[
   96 = 6 + (n-1) \cdot 6 \implies 96 = 6 + 6n - 6 \implies 96 = 6n \implies n = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 numbers in the set that are divisible by 6.

4. **Count the number of elements divisible by 2 but not by 3:**
   This is the number of even numbers minus the number of numbers divisible by 6:

"To find the maximum value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\), we start by simplifying it. Notice that the expression can be rewritten as:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2 = \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2

We need to maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) given the constraints \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\). The term \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized when \(b^2\) is minimized, which occurs when \(b = 3\). The term \(-a^2\) is maximized when \(a^2\) is minimized, which occurs when \(a = -2\).

Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = -2\) into the expression, we get:

\[

"To simplify the expression \(\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ\), we start by expressing \(\tan 100^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 100^\circ\) and \(\cos 100^\circ\). Recall that \(\tan 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ
\]

We can factor out \(\sin 100^\circ\) from the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{\sin 100^\circ}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \sin 100^\circ = \sin 100^\circ \left( \frac{1}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \right)
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\sin 100^\circ\) and \(\cos 100^\circ\). Since \(100^\circ\) is in the second quadrant, \(\sin 100^\circ\) is positive and \(\cos 100^\circ\) is negative. We know that:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 100^\circ = -\cos (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = -\cos 80^\circ

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ \left( \frac{1}{\cos 100^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( \frac{1}{-\cos 80^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( -\frac{1}{\cos 80^\circ} + 4 \right) = \sin 80^\circ \left( \frac{-1 + 4 \cos 80^\circ}{\cos 80^\circ} \right) = \frac{\sin 80^\circ (-1 + 4 \cos 80^\circ)}{\cos 80^\circ}

We can simplify this further by using the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\):

\[
\frac{\sin 80^\circ (-1 + 4 \cos 80^\circ)}{\cos 80^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ (-1 + 4 \sin 10^\circ)}{\sin 10^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{\sin 10^\circ} (-1 + 4 \sin 10^\circ) = \cot 10^\circ (-1 + 4 \sin 10^\circ)

Thus, the simplified form of the expression \(\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ\) is:

First, we know that each of the three rafts has 2 kitsaplar alınıyor. Therefore, the total number of kitsaplar alınıyor is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to determine how many kitsaplar en az bir rafta alınıyor. The upper raft has 8 gizem kitapları, the middle raft has 10 matematik kitapları, and the lower raft has 6 bilim kitapları. Since the middle raft has the most kitsaplar, the lower raft has the second most, and the upper raft has the least, the lower raft will have the most kitsaplar alınıyor.

"To determine the measure of \(\angle BAC\) in the given geometric configuration, we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We have a square \(ABCD\) with a regular heptagon inscribed in the same plane such that they share the same center and \(\overline{AD}\) is a common side of both shapes.

First, let's identify the key angles and properties of the shapes involved:
1. The interior angle of a regular heptagon is given by:
   \[
   \frac{(7-2) \times 180^\circ}{7} = \frac{5 \times 180^\circ}{7} = \frac{900^\circ}{7}
   \]
2. The interior angle of a square is:
   \[
   \frac{(4-2) \times 180^\circ}{4} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
   \]

Since \(\overline{AD}\) is a common side, point \(D\) is a vertex of both the heptagon and the square. Let's denote the center of the heptagon and the square by \(O\). The angle \(\angle AOD\) is the central angle subtended by the side \(AD\) of the heptagon, which is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{7}
\]

Now, consider the triangle \(AOD\). Since \(O\) is the center, \(OA\) and \(OD\) are radii of the heptagon, making \(\triangle AOD\) isosceles. The angle \(\angle OAD\) is half of the central angle \(\angle AOD\):
\[
\angle OAD = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{360^\circ}{7} = \frac{180^\circ}{7}
\]

Next, we need to find \(\angle BAC\). Since \(B\) is a vertex of the square, \(\angle BAC\) is the sum of \(\angle BAO\) and \(\angle OAC\). We already know \(\angle OAD = \frac{180^\circ}{7}\), and \(\angle BAO\) is half of the interior angle of the square:
\[
\angle BAO = \frac{90^\circ}{2} = 45^\circ
\]

Therefore, \(\angle OAC\) is:
\[
\angle OAC = \frac{180^\circ}{7} - 45^\circ
\]

To find the measure of \(\angle BAC\), we add \(\angle BAO\) and \(\angle OAC\):
\[
\angle BAC = 45^\circ + \left( \frac{180^\circ}{7} - 45^\circ \right) = \frac{180^\circ}{7}

   - A \( 3 \times n \) grid consists of 3 rows and \( n \) columns.
   - Each cell in the grid is a unit square.

   Let's take the base as 6 units. The other two sides are each 5 units.

2. **Draw the triangle and drop a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the base:**
   This perpendicular will bisect the base into two equal segments of 3 units each. Now, we have two right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of 5 units and a base of 3 units.

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:**
   In one of the right triangles, let the height be \( h \). According to the Pythagorean theorem:

"To find the product of the \( y \)-coordinates of the solutions to the system of equations \( y = x^2 - 8 \) and \( y^2 = -5x + 44 \), we start by substituting \( y = x^2 - 8 \) into the second equation.

First, substitute \( y \) in the second equation:
\[
(x^2 - 8)^2 = -5x + 44
\]

Next, expand the left side:
\[
x^4 - 16x^2 + 64 = -5x + 44
\]

Rearrange the equation to set it to zero:
\[
x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0
\]

Now, we need to find the roots of this polynomial equation. Let's denote the roots by \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a polynomial of the form \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \), the sum of the roots taken one at a time (i.e., the sum of the roots) is given by \( -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \). For our polynomial \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \), the sum of the roots is:
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 0
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of the \( y \)-coordinates of the solutions. Since \( y = x^2 - 8 \), the sum of the \( y \)-coordinates is:
\[
y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8) + (x_2^2 - 8) + (x_3^2 - 8) + (x_4^2 - 8) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 - 32
\]

To find \( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 \), we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the roots:
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)^2 - 2(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4)
\]

Since \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = -2(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4)
\]

From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is given by \( \frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n} \). For our polynomial \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \), the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:
\[
x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4 = 0
\]

Therefore:
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = -2 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

So, the sum of the \( y \)-coordinates is:
\[
y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 0 - 32 = -32
\]

The product of the \( y \)-coordinates is:
\[
y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8)
\]

To find this product, we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \( x_1^2, x_2^2, x_3^2, x_4^2 \) is \( x^4 - 16x^2 + 20 \). The constant term of this polynomial is 20, which is the product of the roots taken one at a time (i.e., the product of the squares of the roots) with a sign change. Therefore:
\[
(x_1^2)(x_2^2)(x_3^2)(x_4^2) = 20
\]

Since \( y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 = (x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8) \), we can use the identity for the product of differences:
\[
(x_1^2 - 8)(x_2^2 - 8)(x_3^2 - 8)(x_4^2 - 8) = (x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 x_4^2) - 8(x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 + x_1^2 x_2^2 x_4^2 + x_1^2 x_3^2 x_4^2 + x_2^2 x_3^2 x_4^2) + 16(x_1^2 x_2^2 + x_1^2 x_3^2 + x_1^2 x_4^2 + x_2^2 x_3^2 + x_2^2 x_4^2 + x_3^2 x_4^2) - 64(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2) + 4096

Since \( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:

"To determine the total fraction of the turtan that Louis and Jack have together, we need to add the fractions of the turtan that each of them has taken. Louis has taken \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the turtan, and Jack has taken \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the turtan. To add these fractions, we first need a common denominator.

The denominators are 5 and 3. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 15.

First, we convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{3}{15}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{10}{15}

Now that we have a common denominator, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{3}{15} + \frac{10}{15} = \frac{3 + 10}{15} = \frac{13}{15}

Therefore, Louis and Jack together have \(\frac{13}{15}\) of the turtan. The final answer is:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general form of the \(n\)-th term, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general form of the \(n\)-th term:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

"To find the value of \(a\) that makes the sum of the geometric series \(4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots\) a perfect square, we start by identifying the first term and the common ratio of the series. The first term \(a_1\) is 4, and the common ratio \(r\) is \(\frac{\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \frac{3}{a}\).

The sum \(S\) of an infinite geometric series with \(|r| < 1\) is given by the formula:
\[
S = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}
\]
Substituting the values of \(a_1\) and \(r\), we get:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4}{\frac{a - 3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a - 3}
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect square. Let's denote the perfect square by \(k^2\), where \(k\) is a positive integer. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2
\]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[
4a = k^2(a - 3) \implies 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \implies 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \implies a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \implies a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}
\]
Since \(a\) is a positive integer, \(k^2 - 4\) must be a positive divisor of \(3k^2\). Therefore, \(k^2 > 4\), which means \(k > 2\). We will now test the smallest integer values of \(k\) greater than 2.

1. If \(k = 3\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 3^2}{3^2 - 4} = \frac{27}{9 - 4} = \frac{27}{5}

This is not an integer.

2. If \(k = 4\):
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{4^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{16 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4

This is an integer.

We need to verify that \(a = 4\) makes the sum of the series a perfect square:
\[
S = \frac{4 \cdot 4}{4 - 3} = \frac{16}{1} = 16 = 4^2

"To determine the number of \( y \)-intersections of the parabola given by the equation \( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \), we need to find the values of \( y \) for which \( x = 0 \). This is because the \( y \)-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the \( y \)-axis, and at that point, the \( x \)-coordinate is 0.

So, we set \( x = 0 \) in the equation and solve for \( y \):
\[
0 = y^2 - 4y - 1
\]
This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -1 \). To determine the number of solutions to this quadratic equation, we can use the discriminant, which is given by the formula:

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the discriminant formula, we get:
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 16 + 4 = 20
\]
Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 20 \)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions. Therefore, the parabola \( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \) intersects the \( y \)-axis at two points.

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4n}{3} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 100 - 4n \) must be divisible by 3. We can check the divisibility by finding the remainder when 100 and \( 4n \) are divided by 3:

\[ 100 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 4n \equiv n \pmod{3} \]

Thus, \( 100 - 4n \equiv 1 - n \pmod{3} \). For \( 100 - 4n \) to be divisible by 3, we need:

\[ 1 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \]

So, \( n \) can be written as \( n = 3k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k + 1 \) into the equation for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{100 - 4(3k + 1)}{3} = \frac{100 - 12k - 4}{3} = \frac{96 - 12k}{3} = 32 - 4k \]

\[ \left| m - n \right| = \left| (32 - 4k) - (3k + 1) \right| = \left| 31 - 7k \right| \]

To minimize \( \left| 31 - 7k \right| \), we need to find the integer \( k \) closest to \( \frac{31}{7} \):

"To determine the measure of the smallest angle in triangle \(PQS\), we first need to find the coordinates of points \(P\), \(Q\), and \(S\). Given that the dents are centered at \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), and \(S\) with a radius of 1, and that the dents are tangent to \(\triangle ABC\) and its sides, we can deduce the following:

- Point \(P\) is at \((1, \sqrt{3})\).
- Point \(Q\) is at \((-2, 0)\).
- Point \(S\) is at \((2, 0)\).

Next, we calculate the lengths of the sides of triangle \(PQS\):
- The distance \(PQ\) is:
  \[
  PQ = \sqrt{(1 - (-2))^2 + (\sqrt{3} - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{9 + 3} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}

- The distance \(QS\) is:

- The distance \(PS\) is:

\]
Rearranging for \(\cos \gamma\):
\[
\cos \gamma = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
\]

We will calculate the cosine of each angle:
1. For angle \(\angle PQS\):
\[
\cos \angle PQS = \frac{PQ^2 + QS^2 - PS^2}{2 \cdot PQ \cdot QS} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 4^2 - 2^2}{2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 4} = \frac{12 + 16 - 4}{16\sqrt{3}} = \frac{24}{16\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, \(\angle PQS = 30^\circ\).

2. For angle \(\angle QPS\):
\[
\cos \angle QPS = \frac{PQ^2 + PS^2 - QS^2}{2 \cdot PQ \cdot PS} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 2^2 - 4^2}{2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 2} = \frac{12 + 4 - 16}{8\sqrt{3}} = \frac{0}{8\sqrt{3}} = 0

Thus, \(\angle QPS = 90^\circ\).

3. For angle \(\angle PSQ\):

\cos \angle PSQ = \frac{PS^2 + QS^2 - PQ^2}{2 \cdot PS \cdot QS} = \frac{2^2 + 4^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 4} = \frac{4 + 16 - 12}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the equation of the plane passing through the points \((0, -1, -1)\), \((-4, 4, 4)\), and \((4, 5, 1)\), we start by using the general form of the plane equation \(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\). The coefficients \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be found by solving a system of linear equations derived from the coordinates of the points.

First, substitute each point into the plane equation:

1. For the point \((0, -1, -1)\):
   \[
   A(0) + B(-1) + C(-1) + D = 0 \implies -B - C + D = 0 \implies -B - C + D = 0 \implies D = B + C

2. For the point \((-4, 4, 4)\):
   \[
   A(-4) + B(4) + C(4) + D = 0 \implies -4A + 4B + 4C + D = 0 \implies D = 4A - 4B - 4C
   \]

3. For the point \((4, 5, 1)\):
   \[
   A(4) + B(5) + C(1) + D = 0 \implies 4A + 5B + C + D = 0 \implies D = -4A - 5B - C
   \]

Now we have three equations for \(D\):
\[
D = B + C
\]
\[
D = 4A - 4B - 4C
\]
\[
D = -4A - 5B - C
\]

Set the expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[
B + C = 4A - 4B - 4C
\]
\[
B + C = -4A - 5B - C
\]

First, solve \(B + C = 4A - 4B - 4C\):
\[
B + C + 4B + 4C = 4A \implies 5B + 5C = 4A \implies A = \frac{5(B + C)}{4}
\]

Next, solve \(B + C = -4A - 5B - C\):
\[
B + C + 5B + C = -4A \implies 6B + 2C = -4A \implies 3B + C = -2A
\]

Substitute \(A = \frac{5(B + C)}{4}\) into \(3B + C = -2A\):
\[
3B + C = -2\left(\frac{5(B + C)}{4}\right) \implies 3B + C = -\frac{10(B + C)}{4} \implies 3B + C = -\frac{5(B + C)}{2}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
2(3B + C) = -5(B + C) \implies 6B + 2C = -5B - 5C \implies 11B + 7C = 0 \implies C = -\frac{11B}{7}
\]

Substitute \(C = -\frac{11B}{7}\) back into \(A = \frac{5(B + C)}{4}\):
\[
A = \frac{5\left(B - \frac{11B}{7}\right)}{4} \implies A = \frac{5\left(\frac{7B - 11B}{7}\right)}{4} \implies A = \frac{5\left(-\frac{4B}{7}\right)}{4} \implies A = -\frac{5B}{7}
\]

Now we have \(A = -\frac{5B}{7}\) and \(C = -\frac{11B}{7}\). Substitute these into \(D = B + C\):
\[
D = B - \frac{11B}{7} \implies D = \frac{7B - 11B}{7} \implies D = -\frac{4B}{7}
\]

To satisfy \(A > 0\) and \(\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1\), we choose \(B = -7\):
\[
A = -\frac{5(-7)}{7} = 5, \quad C = -\frac{11(-7)}{7} = 11, \quad D = -\frac{4(-7)}{7} = 4

The prime factorizations of 100 and 150 are:

First, recall that:

\sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Given the expression:
\[

we start by converting the innermost square root to an exponent:
\[

Next, we convert the cube root to an exponent:
\[
\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), we simplify:
\[
\left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

Now, we convert the outer square root to an exponent:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}} = \left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Again, using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), we simplify:
\[
\left(\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Next, we express \(\frac{1}{729}\) as a power of 3:
\[
729 = 3^6 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{1}{729} = 3^{-6}
\]

Substituting this back into the expression, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{729}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}} = \left(3^{-6}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\) again, we simplify:
\[
\left(3^{-6}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}} = 3^{-6 \cdot \frac{1}{12}} = 3^{-\frac{1}{2}}

Finally, we convert the negative exponent back to a square root:
\[
3^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{3^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

Now, we combine these results into a single expression:

"To determine the range of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}\), we will analyze it step by step.

First, let's denote the expression by \(E\):
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}. \]

### Step 1: Find a lower bound for \(E\)
We will use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for \(E\). Consider the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b+c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\).

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}}. \]

Since \(\frac{b}{b+c} < 1\), it follows that:
\[ 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}} < 3. \]

Therefore, the lower bound for \(E\) is:
\[ E \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}} > 3 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

However, we need to check if \(E\) can actually reach 3. Consider the case when \(a = b = c\):
\[ E = \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a+a} + \frac{a}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 2.5. \]

So, \(E\) can reach 3, but it is not possible for \(E\) to be exactly 3. Therefore, the lower bound is actually 3.

### Step 2: Find an upper bound for \(E\)
To find an upper bound for \(E\), we will use the fact that \(\frac{a}{b+c} < 1\). Consider the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\) and \(\frac{b}{c}\).

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}. \]

Since \(\frac{b}{a}\) can be arbitrarily large, \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}\) can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\) can be made arbitrarily small, but it will never be zero. However, we can see that:
\[ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}} \geq 2 \sqrt{0} = 0. \]

Thus, the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\) can be made arbitrarily small, but it will never be zero. Therefore, the upper bound for \(E\) is:
\[ E \leq \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{a}{b+c} < \frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c} + 1. \]

Since \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{c}\) can be arbitrarily large, the upper bound for \(E\) is:
\[ E \leq 3. \]

### Conclusion
Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the range of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}\) is:

"To solve the equation \((3^k)^6 = 3^6\), we start by using the properties of exponents. Specifically, the property that states \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\) will be useful here.

Applying this property to the left side of the equation, we get:

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) exist such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) in the form \( k^n \) where \( k \) is a positive integer. This means that \( 2^{24} = k^n \), which implies that \( k \) must be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \). Then we have:

\[
2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}
\]

By equating the exponents, we get:

\[
24 = mn
\]

We need to find all pairs \((m, n)\) of positive integers such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). First, we list the factors of 24:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
\]

Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, the valid pairs \((m, n)\) are:

\[
(2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 3), (12, 2)

Each pair corresponds to a unique value of \( n \):

\[
n = 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2

"To determine how many five-dollar bills Hillary has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of each type of bill.
2. Determine the total value of all the bills.
3. Calculate the number of five-dollar bills based on the total value.

Step 1: Identify the value of each type of bill.
- The value of a one-dollar bill is $1.
- The value of a five-dollar bill is $5.

Step 2: Determine the total value of all the bills.
- The total value of the bills is $75.

Step 3: Calculate the number of five-dollar bills.
- Let \( x \) be the number of five-dollar bills.
- Since the total value of the bills is $75, and each five-dollar bill is worth $5, the total value of the five-dollar bills is \( 5x \).
- The total value of the one-dollar bills is the remaining part of the total value after accounting for the five-dollar bills. However, we don't need to calculate the value of the one-dollar bills directly because we can find \( x \) by dividing the total value by the value of one five-dollar bill.
- Therefore, we have the equation:
  \[
  5x = 75
  \]
- To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

"To find the value of \( x \) where the graphs of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect, we start by setting the two functions equal to each other:

\[

Substituting the expressions for \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):

\[
e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235 |\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356} + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 = e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235 |\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356} + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13
\]

We can simplify this equation by canceling out the common terms on both sides:

\[
3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13
\]

Rearranging the terms gives:

\[
0 = 4x^3 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x^2 - 6x + 6x + 13 - 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 = x^3 - 5x^2 + 12
\]

Next, we need to solve the cubic equation:

\[
x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 = 0
\]

To find the roots of this cubic equation, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 \) must be a factor of the constant term (12) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

We will test these possible roots:

1. For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   1^3 - 5(1^2) + 12 = 1 - 5 + 12 = 8 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

2. For \( x = -1 \):
   \[
   (-1)^3 - 5(-1^2) + 12 = -1 - 5 + 12 = 6 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

3. For \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 5(2^2) + 12 = 8 - 20 + 12 = 0 \quad (\text{a root})
   \]

Since \( x = 2 \) is a root, we can factor \( x - 2 \) out of the polynomial \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 \). We can use synthetic division to find the other factors.

Performing synthetic division of \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 \) by \( x - 2 \):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
2 & 1 & -5 & 0 & 12 \\
  &   & 2 & -6 & -12 \\
\hline
  & 1 & -3 & -6 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \( x^2 - 3x - 6 \). Therefore, we can write:

\[
x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 = (x - 2)(x^2 - 3x - 6)
\]

Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 6 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -6 \):

\[
x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-6)}}{2(1)} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 24}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{33}}{2}
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation are:

\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{33}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{33}}{2}

The roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 12 = 0 \) are:

Thus, the value of \( x \) where the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) intersect, and which is the largest, is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum length of the halat \( HP \) after combining the halats \( HC \) and \( HD \) at a point \( P \) on the line segment \( CD \).

First, let's determine the coordinates of the points:
- \( O \) is the origin \((0, 0)\).
- \( A \) is at \((1, 1)\).
- \( B \) is at \((-1.5, 0.3)\).
- \( C \) is at \((-1, -1)\).
- \( D \) is at \((1.5, -0.3)\).
- \( H \) is at \((0, 2.5)\).

Next, we find the coordinates of the points where the halats \( HC \) and \( HD \) meet the line segment \( CD \):
- The equation of line \( HC \) is the line passing through \( H \) and \( C \). The slope of \( HC \) is \(\frac{-1 - 2.5}{-1 - 0} = 3.5\). The equation is \( y - 2.5 = 3.5(x - 0) \), or \( y = 3.5x + 2.5 \).
- The equation of line \( HD \) is the line passing through \( H \) and \( D \). The slope of \( HD \) is \(\frac{-0.3 - 2.5}{1.5 - 0} = -1.8\). The equation is \( y - 2.5 = -1.8(x - 0) \), or \( y = -1.8x + 2.5 \).

To find the coordinates of \( P \), we set the equations equal to each other:
\[ 3.5x + 2.5 = -1.8x + 2.5 \]
\[ 5.3x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) back into either equation, we get \( y = 2.5 \). Therefore, \( P \) is at \((0, 2.5)\), which is the same as \( H \).

Since \( P \) is at \( H \), the halat \( HP \) has a length of 0. This means that combining the halats \( HC \) and \( HD \) at \( H \) does not change the total length of the halat, which is \( HC + HD = 150 + 130 = 280 \) meters.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the first six randomly selected prime numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and their sums. Specifically, we need to know whether the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even or odd.

First, let's list the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Among these, there is only one even prime number, which is 2. The rest of the prime numbers are odd.

The sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. Therefore, if we select any five of the five odd prime numbers and add the even prime number 2, the sum will be even. If we select any other combination of six prime numbers, the sum will be odd because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd.

Since there is only one even prime number, the only way to get an even sum is to include the even prime number 2 in the selection. The number of ways to choose the remaining five numbers from the five odd prime numbers is \( \binom{5}{5} = 1 \).

The total number of ways to choose any six prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is \( \binom{6}{6} = 1 \).

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the first six randomly selected prime numbers is even is:

\[ b^2 + c^2 = 2m_a^2 + 2\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 \]

In our case, \( PQ = QR = 34 \) and \( PR = 32 \). The median \( QM \) is the median to side \( PR \), so \( a = PR = 32 \), \( b = PQ = 34 \), and \( c = QR = 34 \). The formula becomes:

\[ PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2QM^2 + 2\left(\frac{PR}{2}\right)^2 \]

Substituting the given values, we get:

"To determine the number of possible rational roots of the polynomial \(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (here, 1) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (here, 2).

First, we identify the factors of the constant term and the leading coefficient:
- The factors of 1 are \( \pm 1 \).
- The factors of 2 are \( \pm 1, \pm 2 \).

Therefore, the possible rational roots are the ratios of these factors:

"To determine how many daps 42 baps correspond to, we need to use the given conversion rates: 4 daps = 7 yaps and 5 yaps = 3 baps. We will convert baps to yaps and then convert yaps to daps.

First, let's find out how many yaps are in 42 baps. We know that 5 yaps = 3 baps. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of yaps in 42 baps:

\[
\frac{5 \text{ yaps}}{3 \text{ baps}} = \frac{x \text{ yaps}}{42 \text{ baps}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{5 \text{ yaps} \times 42 \text{ baps}}{3 \text{ baps}} = \frac{210 \text{ yaps} \cdot \text{baps}}{3 \text{ baps}} = 70 \text{ yaps}
\]

So, 42 baps is equivalent to 70 yaps. Next, we need to convert 70 yaps to daps. We know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of daps in 70 yaps:

\[
\frac{4 \text{ daps}}{7 \text{ yaps}} = \frac{y \text{ daps}}{70 \text{ yaps}}
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{4 \text{ daps} \times 70 \text{ yaps}}{7 \text{ yaps}} = \frac{280 \text{ daps} \cdot \text{yaps}}{7 \text{ yaps}} = 40 \text{ daps}

So, 42 baps is equivalent to 40 daps. Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve for \( N \), we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( N \) be the total number of students. When the students are divided into groups of 8, the last group has 5 students, so we can write:

\[ N = 8a + 5 \]

for some integer \( a \). When the students are divided into groups of 6, the last group has 3 students, so we can write:

\[ N = 6b + 3 \]

for some integer \( b \). Therefore, we have the system of congruences:

\[ N \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]
\[ N \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]

We can express \( N \) from the first congruence as:

\[ N = 8a + 5 \]

Substituting this into the second congruence, we get:

\[ 8a + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]

Simplifying the left side modulo 6, we have:

\[ 8a + 5 \equiv 2a + 5 \pmod{6} \]

So the congruence becomes:

\[ 2a + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{6} \]

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2a \equiv -2 \pmod{6} \]

Since \(-2\) is congruent to 4 modulo 6, we can rewrite the congruence as:

\[ 2a \equiv 4 \pmod{6} \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \]

This means that \( a \) can be written as:

\[ a = 3k + 2 \]

for some integer \( k \). Substituting this back into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[ N = 8(3k + 2) + 5 = 24k + 16 + 5 = 24k + 21 \]

So \( N \) can be written as:

\[ N = 24k + 21 \]

We are given that \( N < 50 \), so we need to find the possible values of \( k \):

\[ 24k + 21 < 50 \]

Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get:

\[ 24k < 29 \]

Dividing both sides by 24, we get:

\[ k < \frac{29}{24} \approx 1.2083 \]

Since \( k \) is an integer, the possible values for \( k \) are 0 and 1. Therefore, the possible values for \( N \) are:

\[ N = 24 \cdot 0 + 21 = 21 \]
\[ N = 24 \cdot 1 + 21 = 45 \]

The sum of all possible values of \( N \) is:

"To determine the probability that Alice wins the game, we need to analyze the sequence of moves and the possible outcomes. Let's denote the probability that Alice wins the game as \( P \).

Alice starts the game. If Alice writes, she wins immediately with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \). If Alice does not write, the game continues with Bob. If Bob writes, he wins immediately with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \). If Bob does not write, the game returns to Alice, and the situation is exactly the same as it was at the start of the game.

We can express this situation with the following equation:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot P \]
This equation accounts for the two possible outcomes of Alice's first move:
1. Alice writes and wins immediately with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).
2. Alice does not write, Bob does not write, and the game returns to Alice with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \), in which case the probability that Alice wins from this point onward is \( P \).

To solve for \( P \), we first isolate \( P \) on one side of the equation:
\[ P - \frac{1}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}P = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ P = \frac{2}{3} \]

"To find the remainder when the polynomial \( P(x) = (5x + 9)^{611} + (x + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1 \) is divided by \( x + 2 \), we can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \( P(x) \) by \( x - c \) is \( P(c) \). In this case, we need to find \( P(-2) \).

Let's substitute \( x = -2 \) into the polynomial \( P(x) \):

\[
P(-2) = (5(-2) + 9)^{611} + ((-2) + 5)^{11} + ((-2) - 1)^{11} + 3(-2)^2 + 1
\]

First, we simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
5(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1
\]
\[
(-2) + 5 = 3
\]
\[
(-2) - 1 = -3
\]
\[
3(-2)^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( P(-2) \):

\[
P(-2) = (-1)^{611} + 3^{11} + (-3)^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

Next, we evaluate each term:

\[
(-1)^{611} = -1 \quad \text{(since 611 is odd)}
\]
\[
(-3)^{11} = -3^{11} \quad \text{(since 11 is odd)}
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 3^{11} - 3^{11} + 12 + 1
\]

The \( 3^{11} \) terms cancel each other out:

\[
P(-2) = -1 + 12 + 1 = 12

"Given that \(a, b, c, d\) are distinct complex numbers with \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d = 0\), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\).

First, note that since \(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = 1\), each of these complex numbers lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. The condition \(a + b + c + d = 0\) implies that the sum of these vectors is zero, meaning they are symmetrically distributed around the origin.

Consider the case where \(a, b, c, d\) are the fourth roots of unity. The fourth roots of unity are \(1, i, -1, -i\). These numbers satisfy \(|1| = |i| = |-1| = |-i| = 1\) and \(1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0\). Let's substitute these values into the expression:

\[
(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d) = (1 + i)(1 + (-1))(1 + (-i))(i + (-1))(i + (-i))((-1) + (-i)).
\]

Simplifying each term, we get:

\[
(1 + i)(0)(1 - i)(i - 1)(0)((-1) - i) = 0.
\]

This result is zero, which is not the maximum value. However, this specific configuration does not provide the maximum value because it is a degenerate case where the sum of the products is zero.

To find the maximum value, consider the general case where \(a, b, c, d\) are the fourth roots of unity in some order. The expression \(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\) will be maximized when the magnitudes of the sums \(a + b, a + c, a + d, b + c, b + d, c + d\) are maximized. The maximum value of \(|a + b|\) for \(|a| = |b| = 1\) is 2, which occurs when \(a\) and \(b\) are diametrically opposite on the unit circle.

If we choose \(a = 1, b = -1, c = i, d = -i\), then:

\[
a + b = 1 + (-1) = 0,
\]
\[
a + c = 1 + i,
\]
\[
a + d = 1 + (-i) = 1 - i,
\]
\[
b + c = -1 + i,
\]
\[
b + d = -1 + (-i) = -1 - i,
\]
\[
c + d = i + (-i) = 0.
\]

The expression becomes:

\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |0 \cdot (1 + i) \cdot (1 - i) \cdot (-1 + i) \cdot (-1 - i) \cdot 0| = 0.
\]

This again is zero, but it is a degenerate case. To find a non-degenerate maximum, consider the case where \(a, b, c, d\) are the fourth roots of unity in a different order, such as \(a = 1, b = i, c = -1, d = -i\). Then:

\[
a + b = 1 + i,

b + c = i + (-1) = -1 + i,
\]
\[
b + d = i + (-i) = 0,
\]
\[
c + d = -1 + (-i) = -1 - i.
\]

The expression becomes:

\[
|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)| = |(1 + i) \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - i) \cdot (-1 + i) \cdot 0 \cdot (-1 - i)| = 0.

Finally, we calculate the number of elements in the intersection of all three sets:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{100}{60} \right\rfloor = 1.

Using the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we get:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = 33 + 25 + 20 - 8 - 6 - 5 + 1 = 60.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the two-digit number \( ""AB"" \) such that when it is cubed, the result is \( 912,673 \). Let's start by finding the cube root of \( 912,673 \).

First, we estimate the cube root of \( 912,673 \). We know that:
\[ 10^3 = 1000 \]
\[ 20^3 = 8000 \]
\[ 30^3 = 27000 \]
\[ 40^3 = 64000 \]
\[ 50^3 = 125000 \]
\[ 60^3 = 216000 \]
\[ 70^3 = 343000 \]
\[ 80^3 = 512000 \]
\[ 90^3 = 729000 \]
\[ 100^3 = 1000000 \]

Since \( 912,673 \) is between \( 729,000 \) and \( 1,000,000 \), the cube root of \( 912,673 \) must be between \( 90 \) and \( 100 \). Let's narrow it down further by checking the cubes of \( 91 \) and \( 92 \):
\[ 91^3 = 753571 \]
\[ 92^3 = 778688 \]
\[ 93^3 = 804357 \]
\[ 94^3 = 830584 \]
\[ 95^3 = 857375 \]
\[ 96^3 = 884736 \]
\[ 97^3 = 912673 \]

We see that \( 97^3 = 912,673 \). Therefore, the two-digit number \( ""AB"" \) is \( 97 \). Now, we need to find the sum of the digits \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ A = 9 \]
\[ B = 7 \]
\[ A + B = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

"To determine how many questions Frank answered correctly, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( x \) be the number of correct answers.
- \( y \) be the number of incorrect answers.
- \( z \) be the number of unanswered questions.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Frank answered a total of 80 questions.
2. Frank received 5 points for each correct answer.
3. Frank received -2 points for each incorrect answer.
4. Frank received 0 points for each unanswered question.
5. Frank's total score was 232 points.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 80 \)
2. \( 5x - 2y = 232 \)

We need to solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can solve the first equation for \( z \):
\[ z = 80 - x - y \]

Next, we substitute \( z \) into the second equation:
\[ 5x - 2y = 232 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 80 \)
2. \( 5x - 2y = 232 \)

We can solve the second equation for \( y \):
\[ 5x - 2y = 232 \]
\[ -2y = 232 - 5x \]
\[ y = \frac{5x - 232}{2} \]

Now substitute \( y \) back into the first equation:
\[ x + \frac{5x - 232}{2} + z = 80 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2x + 5x - 232 + 2z = 160 \]
\[ 7x - 232 + 2z = 160 \]
\[ 7x + 2z = 392 \]

Now substitute \( z = 80 - x - y \) into the equation:
\[ 7x + 2(80 - x - y) = 392 \]
\[ 7x + 160 - 2x - 2y = 392 \]
\[ 5x + 160 - 2y = 392 \]
\[ 5x - 2y = 232 \]

We already have this equation, so we need to solve it for \( x \):

\[ 5x - (5x - 232) = 232 \]
\[ 5x - 5x + 232 = 232 \]

"To find the value of the infinite series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\), where \(F_n\) is the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number defined by \(F_0 = 0\), \(F_1 = 1\), and \(F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n\) for \(n \geq 1\), we start by expressing the general term of the series in a more convenient form.

First, we use the identity for Fibonacci numbers:
\[
F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.
\]
We can rewrite the term \(\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\) as:
\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n (F_{n+1} + F_n)} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+1} + F_n^2} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+1}} + \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n^2 + F_n F_{n+1}} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{F_n}{F_{n+1} (F_n + F_{n+1})} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{F_n}{F_{n+1} F_{n+2}}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity:
\[
\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+2} - F_n}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{F_{n+2}}{F_n F_{n+2}} - \frac{F_n}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}}.
\]
Thus, the series becomes a telescoping series:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{F_n} - \frac{1}{F_{n+2}} \right).
\]
 Writing out the first few terms, we get:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{F_1} - \frac{1}{F_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_2} - \frac{1}{F_4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_3} - \frac{1}{F_5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{F_4} - \frac{1}{F_6} \right) + \cdots.
\]
Notice that most terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
\frac{1}{F_1} + \frac{1}{F_2} = 1 + \frac{1}{1} = 2.
\]
Therefore, the value of the infinite series is:

"To determine how many students are studying physics, we need to use the information given and set up a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( P \) be the number of students studying physics.
- Let \( C \) be the number of students studying chemistry.
- Let \( K \) be the number of students studying calculus.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of students is 360.
2. 15 students are taking all three subjects.
3. 180 students are taking calculus.
4. The number of students studying chemistry is twice the number of students studying physics.
5. 75 students are taking both calculus and chemistry.
6. 75 students are taking both calculus and physics.
7. 30 students are taking both calculus and physics.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:

1. \( P + C + K - ( \text{students taking two subjects} ) + ( \text{students taking all three subjects} ) = 360 \)
2. \( K = 180 \)
3. \( C = 2P \)
4. \( ( \text{students taking both calculus and chemistry} ) = 75 \)
5. \( ( \text{students taking both calculus and physics} ) = 75 \)
6. \( ( \text{students taking both calculus and physics} ) = 30 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 180 \) into the first equation:

\[ P + C + 180 - ( \text{students taking two subjects} ) + 15 = 360 \]

Simplify this to:

\[ P + C + 195 - ( \text{students taking two subjects} ) = 360 \]

Subtract 195 from both sides:

\[ P + C - ( \text{students taking two subjects} ) = 165 \]

Next, we need to find the number of students taking two subjects. We know that 75 students are taking both calculus and chemistry, and 75 students are taking both calculus and physics. Let \( x \) be the number of students taking both physics and chemistry. The total number of students taking two subjects is:

\[ 75 + 75 + x = 150 + x \]

Substitute this into the equation:

\[ P + C - (150 + x) = 165 \]

Simplify this to:

\[ P + C - 150 - x = 165 \]

Add 150 to both sides:

\[ P + C - x = 315 \]

We also know that 30 students are taking both calculus and physics, so \( x = 30 \). Substitute \( x = 30 \) into the equation:

\[ P + C - 30 = 315 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ P + C = 345 \]

We already know that \( C = 2P \). Substitute \( C = 2P \) into the equation:

\[ P + 2P = 345 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3P = 345 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ P = 115 \]

Therefore, the number of students studying physics is \(\boxed{115}\).","[115, '115']",110,"[110, '110']",False

1. One Trinket is equivalent to 4 Blinkets.
2. Three Blinkets are equivalent to 7 Drinksets.

First, we need to find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinksets. We can do this by using the second relationship. Since 3 Blinkets are equivalent to 7 Drinksets, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinksets:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ Blinkets}}{7 \text{ Drinksets}} = \frac{x \text{ Blinkets}}{56 \text{ Drinksets}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{3 \text{ Blinkets} \times 56 \text{ Drinksets}}{7 \text{ Drinksets}} = \frac{168 \text{ Blinkets} \cdot \text{Drinksets}}{7 \text{ Drinksets}} = 24 \text{ Blinkets}

\[
\frac{1 \text{ Trinket}}{4 \text{ Blinkets}} = \frac{y \text{ Trinkets}}{24 \text{ Blinkets}}

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we start by examining the properties of the number 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. This means the number must be even (divisible by 2), must end in 0 or 5 (divisible by 5), and must have at least two factors of 3.

Since the number must end in 0 to be divisible by 2 and 5, we start by considering numbers that end in 0. We will check the smallest such numbers that consist only of the digits 0 and 1 and are multiples of 450.

First, we check the smallest number greater than 1 that ends in 0 and is a multiple of 450. We can do this by dividing 450 by 10 and then finding the smallest number that meets the criteria:

\[ \frac{450}{10} = 45 \]

Now, we need to find the smallest number greater than 45 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1 and is a multiple of 45. We can do this by checking the multiples of 45:

\[ 45 \times 1 = 45 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 2 = 90 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 3 = 135 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 5 = 225 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 6 = 270 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]
\[ 45 \times 7 = 315 \quad (\text{not valid, does not end in 0}) \]

Since the first number is one of \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and the second number is one of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) possible pairs of numbers that can be selected.

4. **Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of numbers is the product of the number of choices for the first number and the number of choices for the second number. Since the first number has 3 choices and the second number has 4 choices, the total number of possible pairs is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Since each pair of numbers is equally likely to be selected, the probability that the dama taşı yer weavingili bir kareye yerleştirilir is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there is only one favorable outcome (the intersection of the row and column selected by the first and second numbers), so the probability is \(\frac{1}{12}\).

Therefore, the probability that the dama taşı yer weavingili bir kareye yerleştirilir is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}\).","[1/12, '\\frac{1}{12}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine how much water Sam will have in the pool after he drinks, we need to calculate the amount of water that evaporates and then subtract that from the initial amount of water in the pool.

1. **Initial amount of water in the pool:**
   Sam is carrying 2 gallons of water.

2. **Rate of evaporation:**
   The pool is 3 miles away, and for each mile, the water evaporates to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the water that would have been in the pool if it hadn't evaporated. Therefore, for 3 miles, the total fraction of water that evaporates is:
   \[
   3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2
   \]
   This means that 2 gallons of water evaporate for every 1 gallon of water that would have been in the pool if it hadn't evaporated. Since the pool is initially empty, the total amount of water that evaporates is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of water Sam drinks:**
   Sam drinks 1 gallon of water.

4. **Total amount of water that evaporates and is consumed:**
   The total amount of water that evaporates and is consumed is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Amount of water remaining in the pool:**
   The amount of water remaining in the pool is:
   \[
   2 - 5 = -3 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Since the amount of water remaining in the pool is negative, it means that the pool is empty and Sam has consumed more water than the pool can hold. Therefore, the amount of water Sam will have in the pool after he drinks is:
\[

"To determine the smallest positive value of \( k \) such that the product of 240 and \( k \) is a perfect cube, we start by finding the prime factorization of 240. We have:

\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5
\]

For the product \( 240 \times k \) to be a perfect cube, each prime factor in the factorization of \( 240 \times k \) must have an exponent that is a multiple of 3. The prime factorization of \( 240 \) is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). To make each exponent a multiple of 3, we need to multiply by \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \). Therefore, the smallest \( k \) is:

\[

"To find the area of \(\triangle CDE\), we start by noting that \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}\) and \(BD = 4BC\). This means that \(BD\) and \(BC\) are in the ratio 4:1. Since \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle CDE\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the square root of the ratio of their areas. Here, the ratio of the corresponding sides \(BD\) to \(BC\) is 4:1, so the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle CDE\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(4^2:1^2 = 16:1\).

Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 6 square units, we can find the area of \(\triangle CDE\) by multiplying the area of \(\triangle ABC\) by 16:

"To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, let's calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,

\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), but a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Each top has 2 choices (Kut 1 or Kut 2).

The distance from a point \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) to a plane \(ax + by + cz + d = 0\) is given by:
\[
\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}.

For the plane \(x - z = 0\), the distance \(d_1\) is:
\[
d_1 = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|x - z|}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

For the plane \(x - 2y + z = 0\), the distance \(d_2\) is:
\[
d_2 = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\sqrt{6}}.

For the plane \(x + y + z = 0\), the distance \(d_3\) is:

We are given that:

Combining like terms, we have:

"To find the maximum value of \( e \) given the conditions \( a + b + c + d + e = 8 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 16 \), we can start by expressing \( a + b + c + d \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) in terms of \( e \).

From the first equation, we have:
\[ a + b + c + d = 8 - e. \]

From the second equation, we have:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 16 - e^2. \]

To maximize \( e \), we need to minimize the sum of the squares of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) while keeping their sum constant. The minimum value of the sum of the squares of a set of numbers, given their sum, is achieved when the numbers are as equal as possible. Therefore, let's assume \( a = b = c = d \). Then we have:
\[ 4a = 8 - e \implies a = \frac{8 - e}{4}. \]

Substituting \( a = b = c = d = \frac{8 - e}{4} \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 4 \left( \frac{8 - e}{4} \right)^2 + e^2 = 16. \]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
\[ 4 \cdot \frac{(8 - e)^2}{16} + e^2 = \frac{(8 - e)^2}{4} + e^2 = \frac{64 - 16e + e^2}{4} + e^2 = 16 - 4e + \frac{e^2}{4} + e^2 = 16 - 4e + \frac{5e^2}{4}. \]

Setting this equal to 16, we get:
\[ 16 - 4e + \frac{5e^2}{4} = 16. \]

Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get:
\[ -4e + \frac{5e^2}{4} = 0. \]

Factoring out \( e \), we get:
\[ e \left( \frac{5e}{4} - 4 \right) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions: \( e = 0 \) or \( e = \frac{16}{5} \). Since we are looking for the maximum value of \( e \), we have:
\[ e = \frac{16}{5}. \]

To verify, if \( e = \frac{16}{5} \), then \( a + b + c + d = 8 - \frac{16}{5} = \frac{24}{5} \) and \( a = b = c = d = \frac{6}{5} \). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:
\[ 4 \left( \frac{6}{5} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{16}{5} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{36}{25} + \frac{256}{25} = \frac{144}{25} + \frac{256}{25} = \frac{400}{25} = 16. \]

9. **Determine Chris's current age:**
   Chris's current age is:

   Since \( C = A \), we have:

   Therefore, \( B = 6 - 2A \).

   Chris's current age is:

First, consider the general term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[

We can use the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of \(1 + \omega^k\) for all 1997th roots of unity (except 1) is \(-\frac{1997}{2}\). This identity can be derived from the properties of symmetric sums and the fact that the sum of all 1997th roots of unity is zero.

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we first calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function to the left by \( c \) units corresponds to replacing \( x \) with \( x + c \) in the function. In this case, \( c = 5 \), so the roots of \( g(x) \) are the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units.

If the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(0.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{4} + 0.\overline{2}\), we first need to express each repeating decimal as a fraction.

### Step 1: Convert \(0.\overline{7}\) to a fraction
Let \(x = 0.\overline{7}\). Then, \(10x = 7.\overline{7}\). Subtracting the original \(x\) from this equation, we get:
\[10x - x = 7.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{7} \implies 9x = 7 \implies x = \frac{7}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(0.\overline{4}\) to a fraction
Let \(y = 0.\overline{4}\). Then, \(10y = 4.\overline{4}\). Subtracting the original \(y\) from this equation, we get:
\[10y - y = 4.\overline{4} - 0.\overline{4} \implies 9y = 4 \implies y = \frac{4}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{9}\).

### Step 3: Convert \(0.\overline{2}\) to a fraction
Let \(z = 0.\overline{2}\). Then, \(10z = 2.\overline{2}\). Subtracting the original \(z\) from this equation, we get:
\[10z - z = 2.\overline{2} - 0.\overline{2} \implies 9z = 2 \implies z = \frac{2}{9}.\]
So, \(0.\overline{2} = \frac{2}{9}\).

### Step 4: Substitute the fractions into the expression
Now, substitute \(\frac{7}{9}\), \(\frac{4}{9}\), and \(\frac{2}{9}\) into the expression:
\[\frac{7}{9} - \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{9}.\]

### Step 5: Perform the arithmetic operations
Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them directly:
\[\frac{7 - 4 + 2}{9} = \frac{5}{9}.\]

Thus, the value of the expression \(0.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{4} + 0.\overline{2}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}\).","[5/9, '\\frac{5}{9}']",\frac 59,"[59, '59']",False
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[

"To find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) given the equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\), we can start by multiplying all three equations together. This gives us:

\[
(xy)(xz)(yz) = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(xyz)^2 = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72
\]

Next, we need to calculate the right side. First, we multiply 24 and 48:

\[
24 \cdot 48 = 1152
\]

Now, we multiply the result by 72:

\[
1152 \cdot 72 = 82944
\]

So, we have:

\[
(xyz)^2 = 82944
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = \sqrt{82944} = 288
\]

Now that we have \(xyz = 288\), we can find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) by dividing \(xyz\) by each of the original equations. First, we find \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{xyz}{yz} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Next, we find \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{xyz}{xz} = \frac{288}{48} = 6
\]

Finally, we find \(z\):

\[
z = \frac{xyz}{xy} = \frac{288}{24} = 12

Now that we have \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), and \(z = 12\), we can find \(x + y + z\):

\[

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|} \) is undefined, we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. The denominator is \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| \). We need to solve the equation \( |x^2+3x-4| + |x^2+9x+20| = 0 \).

First, let's factor the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values:
\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = (x+4)(x-1) \]
\[ x^2 + 9x + 20 = (x+4)(x+5) \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ |(x+4)(x-1)| + |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \]

Since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, the sum of two absolute values is zero if and only if each absolute value is zero. Therefore, we need:
\[ |(x+4)(x-1)| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \]

This implies:
\[ (x+4)(x-1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (x+4)(x+5) = 0 \]

The solutions to these equations are:
\[ x = -4, \quad x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -5 \]

However, \( x = -4 \) is a common solution to both equations. Therefore, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( |(x+4)(x-1)| + |(x+4)(x+5)| = 0 \) are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Thus, the function \( f(x) \) is undefined at \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 1 \). The values of \( x \) that are not in the domain of \( f(x) \) are \( -4 \) and \( 1 \).

First, let's consider the parallelogram formed by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax + d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx + d\). The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax + d\) is the same as the distance between the parallel lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx + d\). This distance is given by:
\[
\frac{|d - c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} = \frac{|d - c|}{\sqrt{b^2 + 1}}
\]
The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = bx + c\) is:

\]
The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + d\) and \(y = bx + d\) is:

Given that the area is 18, we have:
\[
\frac{|d - c| |a - b|}{a^2 + 1} = 18 \quad \text{(1)}

Next, let's consider the parallelogram formed by the lines \(y = ax + c\), \(y = ax - d\), \(y = bx + c\), and \(y = bx - d\). The distance between the parallel lines \(y = ax + c\) and \(y = ax - d\) is the same as the distance between the parallel lines \(y = bx + c\) and \(y = bx - d\). This distance is given by:
\[
\frac{|-d - c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} = \frac{|d + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}

Given that the area is 72, we have:
\[
\frac{|d + c| |a - b|}{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)} = 72 \quad \text{(2)}

From equation (1), we can express \(|d - c|\) as:

Substituting this into equation (2), we get:
\[
\frac{\left| \frac{18(a^2 + 1)}{|a - b|} + c \right| |a - b|}{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)} = 72
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
\frac{\left| 18(a^2 + 1) + c |a - b| \right|}{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)} = 72
\]
\[
\left| 18(a^2 + 1) + c |a - b| \right| = 72(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)
\]

To find the minimum value of \(a + b + c + d\), we need to consider the simplest case where \(c = 0\) and \(d = 0\). Then the equations simplify to:
\[
\frac{|a - b|}{a^2 + 1} = 18

"To determine the measure of \(\angle PQR\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(PT\) and \(QR\) are parallel, and we are given the measures of \(\angle P\) and \(\angle Q\). Specifically, \(\angle P = x^\circ\) and \(\angle Q = 2x^\circ\). Additionally, we know that \(\angle R = 128^\circ\).

Since \(PT\) and \(QR\) are parallel, the angle \(\angle P\) is an alternate interior angle to the angle formed by the line segment \(PR\) and the line \(QR\). This angle is equal to \(\angle Q\), but we need to consider the straight line at point \(R\). The angle adjacent to \(\angle Q\) on the straight line is \(180^\circ - 2x^\circ\).

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). In \(\triangle PQR\), the angles are \(\angle P\), \(\angle Q\), and \(\angle R\). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\angle P + \angle Q + \angle R = 180^\circ

Substituting the given values, we get:

Since \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

To minimize \(d\), it is equivalent to minimize \(d^2\):

Expanding the expression inside the parentheses, we get:

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
\frac{d}{du}\left(\frac{1}{4}u^2 - 8u + 81\right) = \frac{1}{2}u - 8

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

Since \(u = x^2\), we have:

"To determine the total amount of money after five years with an initial investment of $24,000 and an annual interest rate of 1%, we need to calculate the compound interest. The formula for the future value \( A \) of a principal \( P \) after \( t \) years with an annual interest rate \( r \) is given by:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

Here, the principal \( P \) is $24,000, the annual interest rate \( r \) is 0.01, and the time \( t \) is 5 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ A = 24000 (1 + 0.01)^5 \]
\[ A = 24000 (1.01)^5 \]

Next, we need to calculate \( (1.01)^5 \). Using a calculator, we find:

\[ (1.01)^5 \approx 1.05101005 \]

Now, we can find the future value \( A \):

\[ A \approx 24000 \times 1.05101005 \]
\[ A \approx 25224.2412 \]

Rounding this value to the nearest whole number, we get:

"To determine the length of the third side of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Let's denote the length of the third side by \( x \).

Given the lengths of the other two sides are 1 and 3, we can write the following inequalities based on the triangle inequality theorem:

1. \( 1 + 3 > x \)
2. \( 1 + x > 3 \)
3. \( 3 + x > 1 \)

Let's solve each inequality step by step:

1. \( 1 + 3 > x \)
   \[
   4 > x \quad \text{or} \quad x < 4
   \]

2. \( 1 + x > 3 \)
   \[

   \]

3. \( 3 + x > 1 \)
   \[
   x > 1 - 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x > -2
   \]
   Since \( x \) is a length, it must be positive, so this inequality is always true for any positive \( x \).

Combining the valid inequalities from above, we get:
\[
2 < x < 4

Since \( x \) is a whole number, the only possible value for \( x \) is 3. Therefore, the length of the third side is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division on the right side:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

So, we have:

\[
n-2 \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\) to the nearest whole number, which is \(6\). Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

Therefore, we can write:

\[ f(x) = (x^2 - 1)q(x) + ax + b \]

for some polynomial \( q(x) \). To determine \( a \) and \( b \), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at the roots of \( x^2 - 1 = 0 \), which are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \).

First, we evaluate \( f(1) \):

\[ f(1) = 1^{10} + 5 \cdot 1^9 - 8 \cdot 1^8 + 7 \cdot 1^7 - 1^6 - 12 \cdot 1^5 + 4 \cdot 1^4 - 8 \cdot 1^3 + 12 \cdot 1^2 - 5 \cdot 1 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = 1 + 5 - 8 + 7 - 1 - 12 + 4 - 8 + 12 - 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(1) = -10 \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(-1) \):

\[ f(-1) = (-1)^{10} + 5 \cdot (-1)^9 - 8 \cdot (-1)^8 + 7 \cdot (-1)^7 - (-1)^6 - 12 \cdot (-1)^5 + 4 \cdot (-1)^4 - 8 \cdot (-1)^3 + 12 \cdot (-1)^2 - 5 \cdot (-1) - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5 \]
\[ f(-1) = 10 \]

Since \( f(1) = a \cdot 1 + b = a + b \) and \( f(-1) = a \cdot (-1) + b = -a + b \), we have the system of equations:

\[ a + b = -10 \]
\[ -a + b = 10 \]

Adding these two equations, we get:

\[ 2b = 0 \]
\[ b = 0 \]

Substituting \( b = 0 \) back into the first equation, we get:

\[ a = -10 \]

"To find the value of \(\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}\) for a polynomial \(p(x)\) of the form \(ax + b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and one of its roots is \(4 - \sqrt{11}\), we start by noting that since the coefficients of the polynomial are integers, the complex conjugate \(4 + \sqrt{11}\) must also be a root of the polynomial. Therefore, the polynomial \(p(x)\) can be written as:

\[ p(x) = a(x - (4 - \sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \sqrt{11})) \]

We can simplify the expression inside the parentheses by recognizing that it is a difference of squares:

\[ p(x) = a((x - 4) + \sqrt{11})((x - 4) - \sqrt{11}) = a((x - 4)^2 - (\sqrt{11})^2) = a(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11) = a(x^2 - 8x + 5) \]

Since \(a\) is an integer, we can choose \(a = 1\) for simplicity, giving us the polynomial:

"To find \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\), we first need to determine the eigenvalues of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \(\mathbf{A}\), which is given by:

\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \begin{vmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 7 \\ -1 & -2 - \lambda \end{vmatrix} = (3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) - (-1)(7) = \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1.
\]

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). These eigenvalues are complex and can be written in polar form as \(\lambda_1 = e^{2\pi i / 6} = e^{\pi i / 3}\) and \(\lambda_2 = e^{-2\pi i / 6} = e^{-\pi i / 3}\).

Since the eigenvalues are complex and lie on the unit circle, we can use the fact that \(\lambda_1^6 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2^6 = 1\). Therefore, we can reduce the exponents modulo 6:

Next, we find \(\mathbf{A}^4\):

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find a unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we rewrite the congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This can be rearranged to:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
We need to solve this quadratic congruence. The quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) can be used, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\]
We need to find the integer solutions modulo 23. First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{2} \) exists modulo 23. We need to check if there is an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

We test the integers from 1 to 11 (since \( -x \) will give the same result as \( x \) modulo 23):
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
\]
Thus, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since we are asked for the unique solution, we need to check which one satisfies the original condition. Both 4 and 17 satisfy the condition, but the problem asks for the unique solution, which implies there is only one solution in the given range.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the x-intercept \(a\), the y-intercept \(b\), and the slope \(m\) of the line given by the equation \(\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1\), and then find the value of \(a + b + m\).

1. **Find the x-intercept \(a\):**
   The x-intercept is the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\). Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{x}{4} = 1 \implies x = 4
   \]
   So, the x-intercept \(a\) is 4.

2. **Find the y-intercept \(b\):**
   The y-intercept is the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{y}{12} = 1 \implies y = 12

   So, the y-intercept \(b\) is 12.

3. **Find the slope \(m\):**
   The given equation is in the form \(\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1\). To find the slope, we can rewrite it in the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\). Start by isolating \(y\):
   \[

"To determine how many different ways the six arrows can be arranged such that all six arrows point in different directions, we need to consider the constraints and the possible permutations of the arrows.

1. **Identify the directions**: There are four possible directions for each arrow: up, down, left, and right. However, since there are six arrows and only four directions, it is impossible for all six arrows to point in different directions. Therefore, there are no valid arrangements that satisfy the condition that all six arrows point in different directions.

2. **Conclusion**: Since it is impossible for all six arrows to point in different directions, the number of different ways to arrange the arrows such that all six arrows point in different directions is 0.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",540,"[540, '540']",True
"To find the maximum value of the expression \(4(x + 7)(2 - x)\), we start by expanding and rewriting the expression in a more convenient form. First, we expand the product \((x + 7)(2 - x)\):

\[
(x + 7)(2 - x) = 2x - x^2 + 14 - 7x = -x^2 - 5x + 14
\]

Next, we multiply this result by 4:

\[
4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56
\]

Now, we have a quadratic function in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a = -4\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 56\). Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative (\(a = -4\)), the parabola opens downwards, and the function has a maximum value at its vertex. The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is found using the formula \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Substituting the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we get:

\[
x = -\frac{-20}{2(-4)} = -\frac{20}{8} = -\frac{5}{2}

Next, we substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) back into the original expression to find the maximum value:

\[

"To convert 3 inches to a fraction of 2 feet, we first need to know the relationship between inches and feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, 2 feet is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches.

Now, we need to express 3 inches as a fraction of 24 inches. This fraction is given by:

\[

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 24, which is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[

"To determine the type of conic section defined by the equation \( r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4 \), we will convert this equation from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. Recall the relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates:

\[ \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting these into the given equation, we get:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}\), we will follow these steps:

2. Multiply the resulting fractions together.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{12}{20}
\]

First, we simplify \(\frac{12}{20}\). The greatest common divisor of 12 and 20 is 4, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
\[
\frac{12}{20} = \frac{12 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \div \frac{3}{5}
\]

Next, we convert the division by \(\frac{3}{5}\) into multiplication by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{5}\) is \(\frac{5}{3}\), so we have:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{3}

Now we multiply the fractions together. To do this, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[

Next, we simplify \(\frac{40}{105}\). The greatest common divisor of 40 and 105 is 5, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{40}{105} = \frac{40 \div 5}{105 \div 5} = \frac{8}{21}

\[
\frac{m}{s} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This implies that:

\[
3m = 4s \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

If 5 mavi bilye eklesin ve 3 sarı bilye çıkarırsan, then the new number of mavi bilyeler will be \( m + 5 \) and the new number of sarı bilyeler will be \( s - 3 \). The new ratio of mavi to sarı bilyeler will be 7:3. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[

This implies that:

\[
3(m + 5) = 7(s - 3)

Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:

Adding 21 to both sides, we get:

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3m = 4s \)
2. \( 3m + 36 = 7s \)

Next, we need to multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The product of a number and its conjugate can be found using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

First, let's find the vectors \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)

Next, we calculate the dot product \(\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27
\]

Now, we find the magnitudes of \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\):
\[
\|\overrightarrow{BA}\| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

\[
\|\overrightarrow{BC}\| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}

Using the dot product formula \(\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = \|\overrightarrow{BA}\| \|\overrightarrow{BC}\| \cos \theta\), we can solve for \(\cos \theta\):

"To determine the measure of \(\angle B\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB\) as the diameter of the circle and \(\angle A = 14^\circ\), we can use the properties of a circle and a triangle.

1. **Identify the type of triangle:**
   Since \(AB\) is the diameter of the circle, \(\angle C\) is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle.

2. **Sum of angles in a triangle:**
   The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ

3. **Substitute the known values:**
   We know that \(\angle A = 14^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

   Subtract 104 degrees from both sides to isolate \(\angle B\):

\[10^x = 10000\]

Next, we recognize that \(10000\) can be written as a power of 10:
\[10000 = 10^4\]

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

\]

The measure of an exterior angle of a regular polygon is given by:

\[
\text{Exterior angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
\]

According to the problem, the interior angle is 6.5 times the exterior angle. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} = 6.5 \times \frac{360^\circ}{n}
\]

To eliminate the denominators, we multiply both sides of the equation by \( n \):

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 6.5 \times 360^\circ
\]

Next, we calculate \( 6.5 \times 360^\circ \):

\[
6.5 \times 360^\circ = 2340^\circ
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 2340^\circ
\]

We then divide both sides by 180^\circ:

\[
n-2 = \frac{2340^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we calculate \( \frac{2340^\circ}{180^\circ} \):

\[
\frac{2340^\circ}{180^\circ} = 13
\]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[
n-2 = 13

Finally, we solve for \( n \) by adding 2 to both sides:

- \( D = (9, 0) \)
- \( E = (9, 3) \)
- \( G = (6, 3) \)

Next, we know that \( BEFH \) is a rectangle with \( BE = 5 \). Since \( B \) is at \( (3, 0) \) and \( E \) is at \( (9, 3) \), the length of \( BE \) is:

However, we are given that \( BE = 5 \), so there must be a different interpretation or a different configuration. Let's assume \( BE \) is a vertical line segment from \( B \) to \( E \) with \( E \) at \( (9, 0) \) and \( B \) at \( (3, 0) \), which is not possible since \( BE = 5 \). Instead, let's assume \( E \) is at \( (9, 5) \) and \( B \) is at \( (3, 0) \).

Now, we need to find the coordinates of \( F \) and \( H \). Since \( F \) and \( H \) are on the line \( y = 5 \) and \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 9 \) respectively, we can use the fact that \( F \) and \( H \) are the points where the perpendicular bisectors of \( BE \) and \( EF \) intersect the line \( y = 5 \).

The midpoint of \( BE \) is:
\[
\left( \frac{3+9}{2}, \frac{0+5}{2} \right) = (6, 2.5)
\]
The slope of \( BE \) is:
\[
\frac{5-0}{9-3} = \frac{5}{6}
\]
The slope of the perpendicular bisector is:
\[
-\frac{6}{5}
\]
The equation of the perpendicular bisector is:
\[
y - 2.5 = -\frac{6}{5}(x - 6)
\]
Substituting \( y = 5 \):
\[
5 - 2.5 = -\frac{6}{5}(x - 6)
\]
\[
2.5 = -\frac{6}{5}x + \frac{36}{5}
\]
\[
2.5 = -\frac{6}{5}x + 7.2
\]
\[
-4.7 = -\frac{6}{5}x
\]
\[
x = \frac{4.7 \times 5}{6} = \frac{23.5}{6} = \frac{47}{12}
\]
So, the coordinates of \( F \) are:
\[
F = \left( \frac{47}{12}, 5 \right)
\]

Now, we need to find the coordinates of \( H \). Since \( H \) is on the line \( y = 5 \) and \( x = 9 \), the coordinates of \( H \) are:
\[
H = (9, 5)
\]

Finally, the length of \( BH \) is:
\[
BH = 9 - 3 = 6
\]

Thus, the length of \( BH \) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected number between 1 and 100, inclusive, is divisible by 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   The numbers from 1 to 100 are the possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 100.

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   A favorable outcome is a number that is divisible by 3. We need to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3.
   A number \( n \) is divisible by 3 if it can be written in the form \( n = 3k \) where \( k \) is an integer.
   The smallest number in the range 1 to 100 that is divisible by 3 is \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).
   The largest number in the range 1 to 100 that is divisible by 3 is \( 3 \times 33 = 99 \).
   Therefore, the numbers divisible by 3 between 1 and 100 are \( 3, 6, 9, \ldots, 99 \).
   This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 3 \), the common difference \( d = 3 \), and the last term \( l = 99 \).
   The number of terms \( n \) in this arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   l = a + (n-1)d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   99 = 3 + (n-1) \cdot 3

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   99 = 3 + 3(n-1)

   \[
   99 = 3n

   So, there are 33 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability \( P \) of a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 being divisible by 3 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{33}{100}

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 is divisible by 3 is \(\boxed{\frac{33}{100}}\).","[33/100, '\\frac{33}{100}']",\dfrac{33}{100},[],False
"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric configuration and use properties of circles and angles.

1. **Identify the given elements and their properties:**
   - \( J \) and \( H \) are points on a circle with center \( J \).
   - \( O \) is the point where the tangent from \( H \) to the circle intersects the circle.
   - \( N \) is the point where the tangent from \( H \) to the circle intersects the line segment \( JN \).

2. **Understand the tangents and their properties:**
   - Since \( HN \) is a tangent to the circle at \( N \), \( JN \) is a radius of the circle.
   - The tangent at any point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, \( HN \perp JN \).

3. **Analyze the triangle \( JNO \):**
   - \( JN \) is a radius of the circle, so \( JN = 3 \) (assuming the radius is 3 units).
   - \( HN \) is a tangent at \( N \), so \( HN \) is perpendicular to \( JN \). Therefore, \( \angle JNH = 90^\circ \).

4. **Determine the angle \( \angle JNO \):**
   - Since \( O \) is the point where the tangent from \( H \) intersects the circle, \( O \) is the point of tangency.
   - The angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of tangency is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Therefore, \( \angle JNO \) is equal to the angle subtended by the arc \( JN \) in the alternate segment, which is \( \angle J \).

5. **Sum the angles \( \angle J \) and \( \angle H \):**
   - We know that \( \angle JNO = \angle J \).
   - Since \( \angle JNH = 90^\circ \), we have \( \angle H = 90^\circ - \angle J \).
   - Therefore, the sum of \( \angle J \) and \( \angle H \) is:
     \[
     \angle J + \angle H = \angle J + (90^\circ - \angle J) = 90^\circ
     \]

"To find the remainder when the sum of the first 10 positive integers is divided by 9, we first need to calculate the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]

For \( n = 10 \), the sum \( S \) is:

\[ S = \frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we need to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 9. We do this by performing the division:

\[ 55 \div 9 = 6 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

This means that 55 can be written as:

\[ 55 = 9 \times 6 + 1 \]

The remainder is the part left over after subtracting the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 55. In this case, the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 55 is \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \), and the remainder is:

"To determine the number of differentancements possible, we need to consider the different ways to assign the two IMO gold medals and the two IPhO gold medals to a single schedule. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to find the number of distinct permutations of a multiset.

The problem can be broken down as follows:
- We have 4 items in total: two IMO gold medals and two IPhO gold medals.
- The number of distinct permutations of a multiset can be calculated using the formula \(\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}\), where \(n\) is the total number of items, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

In this case, \(n = 4\) (the total number of gold medals), and the frequencies are \(n_1 = 2\) (for the IMO gold medals) and \(n_2 = 2\) (for the IPhO gold medals). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine how much more Pam pays than Susan, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for both Susan and Pam and then find the difference between these two amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of one ticket after the discount:
The original price of a ticket is \$20, and the discount is 25%. The amount of the discount is:
\[ 0.25 \times 20 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the price of one ticket after the discount is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets for Susan:
Susan buys 4 tickets, so the total cost for Susan is:

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets for Pam:
Pam buys 5 tickets, so the total cost for Pam is:

"To find the modular inverse of \(997\) modulo \(1000\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[997x = 1000k + 1\]

for some integer \(k\). Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[997x - 1000k = 1\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(997\) and \(1000\):

\[1000 = 1 \cdot 997 + 3\]
\[997 = 332 \cdot 3 + 1\]
\[3 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0\]

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(997\) and \(1000\) are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(997\) and \(1000\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 3\]

Substitute \(3\) from the first equation:

\[3 = 1000 - 1 \cdot 997\]

So,

\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot (1000 - 1 \cdot 997)\]
\[1 = 997 - 332 \cdot 1000 + 332 \cdot 997\]
\[1 = 997 + 332 \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]
\[1 = (1 + 332) \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]
\[1 = 333 \cdot 997 - 332 \cdot 1000\]

This equation shows that:

\[333 \cdot 997 \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\]

"To convert the repeating decimal \(0.\overline{1331}\) into a fraction, let \(x = 0.\overline{1331}\). This means that \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\).

To eliminate the repeating part, we multiply both sides of the equation by \(10000\):
\[10000x = 1331.133113311331\ldots\]

Now, we subtract the original equation \(x = 0.133113311331\ldots\) from this new equation:
\[10000x - x = 1331.133113311331\ldots - 0.133113311331\ldots\]
\[9999x = 1331\]
\[x = \frac{1331}{9999}\]

Next, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{1331}{9999}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1331 and 9999. First, we factorize both numbers:
\[1331 = 11^3\]
\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101\]

The only common factor between 1331 and 9999 is 11. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 11:

The fraction \(\frac{121}{909}\) is in its simplest form because the GCD of 121 and 909 is 1. Here, \(a = 121\) and \(b = 909\).

2. Convert the amount from dollars to dollars using the American exchange rate.

\[
\text{Dollars} = \frac{\text{Litters}}{\text{Litters per dollar}} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ liters}}{1200 \text{ liters/dollar}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1200} = 833.33 \text{ dollars}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration described. The set \( S \) is the union of the set of all points inside a regular nonagon (9-sided polygon) with a side length of 2 and the set of all points that are at a distance of more than 1 unit from the perimeter of the nonagon.

First, let's consider the regular nonagon. The perimeter of the nonagon is given by:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ units}
\]

Next, we need to determine the area of the region that is more than 1 unit away from the perimeter of the nonagon. This region is a smaller nonagon inside the original nonagon, where each side of the smaller nonagon is parallel to the corresponding side of the original nonagon and is 2 units away from it.

To find the side length of the smaller nonagon, we need to consider the geometry of the regular nonagon. The distance from the center of a regular nonagon to a side (the apothem) can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Apothem} = \frac{s}{2 \tan(\pi/9)}
\]
where \( s \) is the side length of the nonagon. For the original nonagon, the apothem is:
\[
\text{Apothem}_{\text{original}} = \frac{2}{2 \tan(\pi/9)} = \frac{1}{\tan(\pi/9)}
\]

The apothem of the smaller nonagon is:
\[
\text{Apothem}_{\text{smaller}} = \text{Apothem}_{\text{original}} - 1 = \frac{1}{\tan(\pi/9)} - 1
\]

The side length \( s_{\text{smaller}} \) of the smaller nonagon can be found using the relationship between the apothem and the side length:
\[
s_{\text{smaller}} = 2 \tan(\pi/9) \cdot \text{Apothem}_{\text{smaller}} = 2 \tan(\pi/9) \left( \frac{1}{\tan(\pi/9)} - 1 \right) = 2 - 2 \tan(\pi/9)
\]

The perimeter of the smaller nonagon is:
\[
9 \times (2 - 2 \tan(\pi/9)) = 18 - 18 \tan(\pi/9)
\]

The area of a regular nonagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{9}{4} s^2 \cot(\pi/9)
\]

The area of the original nonagon is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = \frac{9}{4} \cdot 2^2 \cot(\pi/9) = 9 \cot(\pi/9)
\]

The area of the smaller nonagon is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = \frac{9}{4} (2 - 2 \tan(\pi/9))^2 \cot(\pi/9) = \frac{9}{4} \cdot 4 (1 - \tan(\pi/9))^2 \cot(\pi/9) = 9 (1 - \tan(\pi/9))^2 \cot(\pi/9)
\]

The area of the region that is more than 1 unit away from the perimeter of the nonagon is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{region}} = \text{Area}_{\text{original}} - \text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = 9 \cot(\pi/9) - 9 (1 - \tan(\pi/9))^2 \cot(\pi/9) = 9 \cot(\pi/9) \left( 1 - (1 - \tan(\pi/9))^2 \right)
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
1 - (1 - \tan(\pi/9))^2 = 1 - (1 - 2 \tan(\pi/9) + \tan^2(\pi/9)) = 2 \tan(\pi/9) - \tan^2(\pi/9) = \tan(\pi/9) (2 - \tan(\pi/9))
\]

Thus, the area of the region is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{region}} = 9 \cot(\pi/9) \tan(\pi/9) (2 - \tan(\pi/9)) = 9 (2 - \tan(\pi/9))
\]

However, we need to find the area of the set \( S \), which is the union of the area of the original nonagon and the area of the region that is more than 1 unit away from the perimeter. Since the area of the region is very small compared to the area of the nonagon, the area of \( S \) is approximately equal to the area of the original nonagon:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{S}} \approx 9 \cot(\pi/9)
\]

To find the exact area, we need to consider the exact value of \( \tan(\pi/9) \), but for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate the area as:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{S}} = 9 \cot(\pi/9) \approx 9 \cdot 3 = 27

\[ 120 - \sqrt{x} = k^2. \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \(\sqrt{x}\), we get

\[ \sqrt{x} = 120 - k^2. \]

Since \(\sqrt{x}\) must be a non-negative real number, it follows that

\[ 120 - k^2 \geq 0. \]

This inequality simplifies to

\[ k^2 \leq 120. \]

The largest integer \( k \) that satisfies this inequality is 10, because \( 10^2 = 100 \) and \( 11^2 = 121 \). Therefore, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 10, inclusive. This gives us 11 possible values for \( k \):

\[ k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. \]

For each value of \( k \) from 0 to 10, there is a corresponding non-negative value of \( x \) given by

The three circles have radii \(R_1 = 4\), \(R_2 = 6\), and \(R_3 = 7\). The areas of the circles are:
\[

The total area of the three circles is:

The regions \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are the areas of the circles that do not overlap with each other. To find the areas of these regions, we need to consider the areas of the segments of the circles that are not overlapping.

The area of region \(X\) is the area of the circle with radius 4, which is \(16\pi\). The area of region \(Y\) is the area of the circle with radius 6, which is \(36\pi\). The area of region \(Z\) is the area of the circle with radius 7, which is \(49\pi\).

However, since the circles are overlapping, the actual areas of the regions \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are less than these values. The largest region is the area of the circle with radius 7, which is \(49\pi\), and the smallest region is the area of the circle with radius 4, which is \(16\pi\).

The difference between the area of the largest region and the area of the smallest region is:

"To determine how many positive integers divide the expression \(a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab\), we start by simplifying the expression. Notice that we can combine like terms:

\[
a(2a + b) - 2a^2 + ab = 2a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + ab = 2ab.
\]

So, the expression simplifies to \(2ab\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct prime numbers greater than 2, both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. Therefore, \(2ab\) is an even number and is divisible by 2, \(a\), \(b\), and \(ab\).

To find all the positive divisors of \(2ab\), we consider the prime factorization of \(2ab\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct primes, the prime factorization of \(2ab\) is \(2 \cdot a \cdot b\). The number of positive divisors of a number \(n\) with prime factorization \(p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\).

"To determine the measure of angle \( A \) in the given configuration, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the regular pentagon \( FGHIJ \) and the line segments that form the yod.

First, recall that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal interior angles. The measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ.

Now, consider the yod formed by the line segments \( FG \), \( GH \), \( HI \), \( IJ \), and \( JF \). The yod is a star-shaped figure with five points, and each point is formed by the intersection of two line segments. The angle \( A \) is the angle at one of these points of the yod.

To find the measure of angle \( A \), we need to look at the configuration of the pentagon and the yod. The yod can be divided into smaller triangles, and the angle \( A \) is one of the angles of these triangles.

By symmetry and geometric properties, the angle \( A \) is equal to the exterior angle of the pentagon. The exterior angle of a regular pentagon is:

"To solve the expression \(\left(4\dfrac{5}{8}\right)^{55} \cdot \left(\dfrac{8}{37}\right)^{55}\), we start by converting the mixed number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) into an improper fraction. The number \(4\dfrac{5}{8}\) can be written as:

\[4\dfrac{5}{8} = 4 + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{32}{8} + \dfrac{5}{8} = \dfrac{37}{8}\]

So the expression becomes:

Next, we use the property of exponents that states \(a^m \cdot b^m = (a \cdot b)^m\). Applying this property, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta.

"To solve the problem, we need to consider all possible positive integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that form a triangle. The triangle inequality states that for any three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of a triangle, the following must hold:
\[a + b > c,\]
\[a + c > b,\]
\[b + c > a.\]

We need to sum the expression \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) over all such triples. To do this, we will first sum over all possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and then apply the triangle inequality constraints.

First, consider the sum of \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) over all positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) without any constraints:
\[\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \left( \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{1} \right) \left( \sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3} \right) \left( \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{5} \right).\]

The sum \(\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{1}\) is a geometric series with the first term 2 and common ratio 2, so it diverges. However, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the triangle inequality.

To find the sum over the valid triples, we can use a generating function approach. The generating function for the sequence \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) is:
\[\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} = \frac{2}{3^b 5^c} \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a = \frac{2}{3^b 5^c} \cdot \frac{2}{1-2} = \frac{4}{3^b 5^c}.\]

We need to sum this over all valid \((b, c)\) such that \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\). This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can use a known result for the sum of such a series.

The sum of \(\frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}\) over all valid triples \((a, b, c)\) is given by:

"To determine when the signs on both dişli dakikada will next show a total of a full kuzey, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of times each dişli dakika döner.

The LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and 45 will give us the number of times each dişli dakika döner after which their signs will next show a total of a full kuzey.

First, we find the LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and 45. To do this, we convert 45 into a fraction, which is \(\frac{45}{1}\). The LCM of two fractions is given by the LCM of the numerators divided by the GCD of the denominators. The numerators are 100 and 45, and the denominators are 3 and 1. The GCD of 3 and 1 is 1. Therefore, the LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and \(\frac{45}{1}\) is:
\[
\text{LCM} = \frac{\text{LCM}(100, 45)}{\text{GCD}(3, 1)} = \frac{\text{LCM}(100, 45)}{1} = \text{LCM}(100, 45)
\]

Next, we find the LCM of 100 and 45. The prime factorization of 100 is \(2^2 \times 5^2\) and the prime factorization of 45 is \(3^2 \times 5\). The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(100, 45) = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 25 = 900

So, the LCM of \(\frac{100}{3}\) and 45 is 900. This means that after 900 dişli dakika döner, the signs on both dişli dakika will next show a total of a full kuzey. Since the first dişli dakika döner \(\frac{100}{3}\) kez per second and the second dişli dakika döner 45 kez per second, the time it takes for 900 dişli dakika döner is:

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use \(\mathbf{d}_1\) as the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\).

Let \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get

\[
\mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = 31 \mathbf{i} - 6 \mathbf{j} + 58 \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of this vector is

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To find the minimum value of the expression \((a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right)\), we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality. The AM-HM inequality states that for any positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n}}.
\]

Applying this inequality to our problem with \(x_1 = a\), \(x_2 = b\), \(x_3 = c\), and \(x_4 = d\), we get

\[
\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain

\[
a + b + c + d \geq \frac{16}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}\), we get

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) \geq 16.
\]

To check if this minimum value is achievable, we consider the equality condition of the AM-HM inequality, which occurs when \(a = b = c = d\). Let \(a = b = c = d = k\). Then,

\[
(a + b + c + d) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \right) = (k + k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) = 4k \cdot \frac{4}{k} = 16.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",16,"[16, '16']",True
"To solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(2r - 7\):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7)
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
(4r - 3)(2r - 7) = 4r \cdot 2r + 4r \cdot (-7) + (-3) \cdot 2r + (-3) \cdot (-7) = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

To simplify, we move all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0
\]

We can multiply the entire equation by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0
\]

Next, we factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \cdot 28 = 56\) and add up to \(-15\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(-8\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r - 4 = 0
\]

Solving these equations, we get:

\[
r = \frac{7}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4
\]

However, we must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they do not make the denominator zero. The original equation is:

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3
\]

If \(r = \frac{7}{2}\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is:

\[
2 \left( \frac{7}{2} \right) - 7 = 7 - 7 = 0
\]

So, \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is not a valid solution. If \(r = 4\), the denominator \(2r - 7\) is:

\[
2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1
\]

So, \(r = 4\) is a valid solution. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count all the integer coordinate points \((x, y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\).

First, let's consider the range for \(x\). The \(x\)-coordinates must be greater than \(-5\) and less than \(5\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible values for \(x\).

Next, let's consider the range for \(y\). The \(y\)-coordinates must be greater than \(-4\) and less than \(4\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us 7 possible values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):
\[
9 \times 7 = 63

"To solve for \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \) given the recurrence relation \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \) for \( n \geq 5 \) and the initial conditions \( x_1 = 211 \), \( x_2 = 375 \), \( x_3 = 420 \), \( x_4 = 523 \), we first need to find the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns.

Starting with the initial conditions:
\[ x_1 = 211, \]
\[ x_2 = 375, \]
\[ x_3 = 420, \]
\[ x_4 = 523. \]

Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( x_5 \):
\[ x_5 = x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267. \]

Next, we find \( x_6 \):
\[ x_6 = x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211. \]

Next, we find \( x_7 \):
\[ x_7 = x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375. \]

Next, we find \( x_8 \):
\[ x_8 = x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420. \]

Next, we find \( x_9 \):
\[ x_9 = x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523. \]

Next, we find \( x_{10} \):
\[ x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -207. \]

Next, we find \( x_{11} \):
\[ x_{11} = x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -207 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 271. \]

Next, we find \( x_{12} \):
\[ x_{12} = x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 271 - (-207) + (-523) - (-420) = 375. \]

We observe that \( x_{12} = x_2 \). Let's check the next few terms to see if there is a repeating pattern:
\[ x_{13} = x_{12} - x_{11} + x_{10} - x_9 = 375 - 271 + (-207) - (-523) = 420, \]
\[ x_{14} = x_{13} - x_{12} + x_{11} - x_{10} = 420 - 375 + 271 - (-207) = 523, \]
\[ x_{15} = x_{14} - x_{13} + x_{12} - x_{11} = 523 - 420 + 375 - 271 = 211. \]

We see that \( x_{15} = x_1 \). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, we can write:
\[ x_{531} = x_{531 \mod 12} = x_3 = 420, \]
\[ x_{753} = x_{753 \mod 12} = x_9 = -523, \]
\[ x_{975} = x_{975 \mod 12} = x_{9} = -523. \]

Thus, we have:
\[ x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + (-523) + (-523) = 420 - 1046 = -626. \]

"To solve the system of inequalities \(0 \ge 54p - 144\) and \(0 > 12 - 20p\), we will solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solution sets.

First, let's solve the inequality \(0 \ge 54p - 144\):
\[
0 \ge 54p - 144
\]
Add 144 to both sides:
\[
144 \ge 54p
\]
Divide both sides by 54:
\[
\frac{144}{54} \ge p
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(0 > 12 - 20p\):
\[
0 > 12 - 20p

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
-12 > -20p
\]
Divide both sides by -20 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest three-digit palindromic number whose sum is less than 220. A three-digit palindromic number can be written in the form \( aba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits, and \( a \neq 0 \). The numerical value of this number is \( 100a + 10b + a = 101a + 10b \).

We need to maximize \( 101a + 10b \) under the condition that \( 101a + 10b < 220 \).

First, let's consider the maximum possible value for \( a \). Since \( a \) is a digit and \( a \neq 0 \), the largest possible value for \( a \) is 2. If \( a = 2 \), then the inequality becomes:
\[ 101 \cdot 2 + 10b < 220 \]
\[ 202 + 10b < 220 \]
\[ 10b < 18 \]
\[ b < 1.8 \]
Since \( b \) is a digit, the largest possible value for \( b \) is 1. Therefore, the largest three-digit palindromic number that satisfies the condition is \( 212 \).

To verify, we calculate the sum of the digits of 212:
\[ 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \]
And the numerical value of 212 is:
\[ 212 \]
Since \( 212 < 220 \), the number 212 is indeed a valid solution.

"To solve the equation \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \), we start by recognizing that it can be rewritten in a form that suggests a binomial expansion. Notice that the coefficients of the polynomial match the binomial expansion of \( (z + i)^4 \) except for the constant term. The binomial expansion of \( (z + i)^4 \) is:

\[
(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + 1
\]

Thus, the given equation can be rewritten as:

\[
(z + i)^4 = 1
\]

Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:

\[
z + i = e^{i\frac{k\pi}{2}} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3
\]

This gives us four solutions:

\[
z = e^{i\frac{k\pi}{2}} - i \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3
\]

Calculating these, we have:

\[
z_0 = e^{i\cdot 0} - i = 1 - i

\[
z_1 = e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} - i = i - i = 0
\]
\[
z_2 = e^{i\pi} - i = -1 - i

The solutions to the equation are \( z_0 = 1 - i \), \( z_1 = 0 \), \( z_2 = -1 - i \), and \( z_3 = -2i \). These points in the complex plane form a quadrilateral with vertices at \( (1, -1) \), \( (0, 0) \), \( (-1, -1) \), and \( (0, -2) \).

To find the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the Shoelace Theorem. The Shoelace Theorem states that for vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\) of a polygon, the area is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \right|
\]

Applying the Shoelace Theorem to our vertices \((1, -1)\), \((0, 0)\), \((-1, -1)\), and \((0, -2)\), we get:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1\cdot0 + 0\cdot(-1) + (-1)\cdot(-2) + 0\cdot(-1) - (-1)\cdot0 - 0\cdot(-1) + (-1)\cdot0 + (-2)\cdot1 \right|

"To determine which equation has the largest solution for \( x \), we need to analyze the behavior of each equation. The general form of each equation is \( 3(1 + k)^x = 7 \), where \( k \) is a constant. The larger the value of \( k \), the faster the function \( (1 + k)^x \) grows, and thus the smaller the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

Let's compare the constants \( k \) in each equation:
- For equation (A), \( k = r \).
- For equation (B), \( k = \frac{r}{10} \).
- For equation (C), \( k = 2r \).
- For equation (D), \( k = \sqrt{r} \).
- For equation (E), \( k = \frac{1}{r} \).

Since \( 0 < r < 3 \), we can compare the values of \( k \):
- \( r \) is between 0 and 3.
- \( \frac{r}{10} \) is between 0 and \( \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \).
- \( 2r \) is between 0 and 6.
- \( \sqrt{r} \) is between 0 and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).
- \( \frac{1}{r} \) is between \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \) and \( \infty \).

The largest value among these constants is \( 2r \), which occurs in equation (C). Therefore, the equation with the largest solution for \( x \) is equation (C).

The correct option is \(\boxed{\text{C}}\).","[C, '\\text{C}']",\text{(B)},[],False
"To determine the smallest possible number of pages in a book given the conditions, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( n \) be the number of pages in the book.
- Let \( p \) be the number of pages in each chapter.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The number of pages \( n \) is more than twice the number of chapters \( p \), i.e., \( n > 2p \).
2. The number of pages \( n \) is more than 100, i.e., \( n > 100 \).

Additionally, we know that each page is counted twice (once for each side of the page), so the total number of pages \( n \) is half the total number of sides, which is \( \frac{2p}{2} = p \). Therefore, the number of pages \( n \) is also equal to the number of chapters \( p \) times the number of pages per chapter \( p \), i.e., \( n = p \).

Combining these two conditions, we get:
\[ n > 2p \]
\[ n > 100 \]

Since \( n = p \), we substitute \( p \) with \( n \) in the first inequality:
\[ n > 2n \]

This inequality is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our interpretation. The correct interpretation is that the number of pages \( n \) is more than twice the number of chapters \( p \), i.e., \( n > 2p \), and the number of pages \( n \) is more than 100, i.e., \( n > 100 \).

To find the smallest possible number of pages \( n \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. We start by solving the inequality \( n > 2p \) for \( p \):

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 - 21 + 14 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To determine how many integer coordinate points lie inside the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((5,-4)\), \((-5,4)\), and \((-5,-4)\), we need to count all the points \((x,y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\).

First, we calculate the number of pairs of circles. The number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 4 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{2} \), but since each pair of circles can intersect at 2 points, we multiply by 2:

\[

"To determine the average price of the 70s stamps in Juan's collection, we need to calculate the total price of all the 70s stamps and then divide by the number of 70s stamps.

First, let's identify the number of stamps and their prices for each country in the 70s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps at $6 each
- France: 12 stamps at $4 each
- Peru: 9 stamps at $4 each
- Spain: 13 stamps at $10 each

Next, we calculate the total price for each country:
- Total price for Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) dollars
- Total price for France: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) dollars
- Total price for Peru: \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars
- Total price for Spain: \(13 \times 10 = 130\) dollars

Now, we sum these total prices to get the overall total price of the 70s stamps:
\[72 + 48 + 36 + 130 = 286\] dollars

Next, we find the total number of 70s stamps:
\[12 + 12 + 9 + 13 = 46\] stamps

To find the average price per stamp, we divide the total price by the total number of stamps:
\[\text{Average price per stamp} = \frac{286}{46} \approx 6.2174\] dollars

Since we need to round this to the nearest tenth, we look at the digit in the hundredths place, which is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we round down. Therefore, the average price per stamp is approximately 6.2 dollars.

"To determine the number of digits in the repeating block of the decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\), we first need to find the decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\).

We start by performing the long division of 31 by 11111:

1. \(31 \div 11111 = 0\) with a remainder of 31.
2. Bring down a 0 to make it 310. \(310 \div 11111 = 0\) with a remainder of 310.
3. Bring down another 0 to make it 3100. \(3100 \div 11111 = 0\) with a remainder of 3100.
4. Bring down another 0 to make it 31000. \(31000 \div 11111 = 2\) with a remainder of 8778.
5. Bring down another 0 to make it 87780. \(87780 \div 11111 = 7\) with a remainder of 9993.
6. Bring down another 0 to make it 99930. \(99930 \div 11111 = 8\) with a remainder of 11112.
7. Bring down another 0 to make it 111120. \(111120 \div 11111 = 9\) with a remainder of 31.

At this point, we see that the remainder is back to 31, which means the decimal will start repeating. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\) is \(0.\overline{0027089}\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the segments as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{a}{c}
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b)
\]

We are given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b) = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

To find \(c\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the segments into which it divides the hypotenuse. Therefore, \(c = \sqrt{ab}\).

Substituting \(c = \sqrt{ab}\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \sqrt{ab}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal. Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = \frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1} \) for \( x > 0 \), we start by simplifying the expression. First, we expand the numerator:

\[
(x + 5)(x + 2) = x^2 + 7x + 10
\]

So the function becomes:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1}
\]

Next, we perform polynomial long division to simplify this expression. We divide \( x^2 + 7x + 10 \) by \( x + 1 \):

1. Divide the leading term \( x^2 \) by \( x \) to get \( x \).
2. Multiply \( x \) by \( x + 1 \) to get \( x^2 + x \).
3. Subtract \( x^2 + x \) from \( x^2 + 7x + 10 \) to get \( 6x + 10 \).
4. Divide the leading term \( 6x \) by \( x \) to get \( 6 \).
5. Multiply \( 6 \) by \( x + 1 \) to get \( 6x + 6 \).
6. Subtract \( 6x + 6 \) from \( 6x + 10 \) to get \( 4 \).

So, the result of the division is:

\[
\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1} = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}
\]

Thus, the function \( f(x) \) can be rewritten as:

\[
f(x) = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}

To find the minimum value of \( f(x) \), we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero. First, we rewrite \( f(x) \) as:

f(x) = x + 6 + \frac{4}{x + 1}
\]

The derivative of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
f'(x) = 1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[
1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
\frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 1
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 = 4
\]
\[
x + 1 = 2 \quad \text{(since \( x > 0 \))}
\]
\[
x = 1
\]

To confirm that this critical point is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( 1 - \frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} \right) = \frac{8}{(x + 1)^3}
\]

Since \( f''(x) > 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), the function \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at \( x = 1 \).

Now, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 1 \):

\[
f(1) = 1 + 6 + \frac{4}{1 + 1} = 1 + 6 + 2 = 9
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x > 0 \) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:

"To determine the number of solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) given that one of its solutions is \(c\) and that \(c^2 - 2\) is also a solution, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the solutions**: Let the solutions of the quadratic equation be \(c\) and \(d\). Since the quadratic equation is of the form \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\), the sum of the roots \(c + d\) is equal to \(-a\) and the product of the roots \(cd\) is equal to \(b\).

2. **Use the given condition**: We know that \(c^2 - 2\) is also a solution. Therefore, \(d = c^2 - 2\).

3. **Substitute \(d\) into the sum of the roots**: The sum of the roots is \(c + d = c + (c^2 - 2) = c^2 + c - 2\). According to Vieta's formulas, this sum is equal to \(-a\). So, we have:
   \[
   c^2 + c - 2 = -a \implies a = -c^2 - c + 2.
   \]

4. **Substitute \(d\) into the product of the roots**: The product of the roots is \(cd = c(c^2 - 2) = c^3 - 2c\). According to Vieta's formulas, this product is equal to \(b\). So, we have:
   \[
   b = c^3 - 2c.

   \[
   x^2 + (-c^2 - c + 2)x + (c^3 - 2c) = 0.
   \]
   We know that the solutions are \(c\) and \(c^2 - 2\). To check if there is a third solution, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots is \(-a\) and the product of the roots is \(b\). Since we already have two distinct roots \(c\) and \(c^2 - 2\), and the sum and product conditions are satisfied, there cannot be a third distinct root. Therefore, the quadratic equation has exactly two distinct solutions.

"To determine the range of the function \( y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) \) for \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the logarithm and then apply the properties of the logarithmic function.

1. **Identify the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\):**
   - The sine function, \(\sin x\), is positive in the interval \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\).
   - The minimum value of \(\sin x\) in this interval is \(\sin 0^\circ = 0\) ( approached as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\)), and the maximum value is \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\).
   - Therefore, the range of \(\sin x\) for \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\) is \(0 < \sin x \leq 1\).

2. **Determine the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\):**
   - Since the square root function is increasing and defined for positive inputs, the range of \(\sqrt{\sin x}\) will be \(\sqrt{0} < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq \sqrt{1}\), which simplifies to \(0 < \sqrt{\sin x} \leq 1\).

3. **Find the range of \(y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})\):**
   - The logarithm function \(\log_2 t\) is defined for \(t > 0\) and is increasing. As \(t\) approaches 0 from the right, \(\log_2 t\) approaches \(-\infty\), and \(\log_2 1 = 0\).
   - Therefore, the range of \(y = \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})\) is \((-\infty, 0]\).

"To find the surface area of one of the two parts created by a plane passing through the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) of a regular tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge length 2, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the tetrahedron:**
   A regular tetrahedron with edge length 2 can be placed in a coordinate system such that:
   \[
   A = \left(1, 1, 1\right), \quad B = \left(1, -1, -1\right), \quad C = \left(-1, 1, -1\right), \quad D = \left(-1, -1, 1\right)

2. **Find the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\):**
   The midpoint of \(AC\) is:
   \[
   M = \left(\frac{1 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{1 + 1}{2}, \frac{1 + (-1)}{2}\right) = (0, 1, 0)

   The plane \(y = 0\) divides the tetrahedron into two congruent pyramids, each with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) split into two parts. One of these parts has vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and the midpoint of \(AD\), which is:

   M_D = \left(\frac{1 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{1 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{1 + 1}{2}\right) = (0, 0, 1)

"To find the smallest possible sum of the distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we start by finding the prime factorization of 84. The prime factorization of 84 is:

\[ 84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \]

We need to express 84 as a product of distinct positive integers. The distinct factors of 84 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84. We need to select a subset of these factors whose product is 84 and whose sum is minimized.

Let's consider the possible subsets:

11. \( 84 = 7 \times 4 \times 3 \)

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

We can write each term in a more convenient form. Notice that each term is a number consisting of the digit 1 followed by a certain number of digits. Specifically, the \(k\)-th term is a number with \(k\) digits, all of which are 1. This number can be expressed as:

\[\frac{10^k - 1}{9}.\]

So, the sum of the series can be rewritten as:

We can factor out \(\frac{1}{9}\) from the sum:

\[\frac{1}{9} \sum_{k=1}^{8} (10^k - 1).\]

This can be split into two separate sums:

\[\frac{1}{9} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{8} 10^k - \sum_{k=1}^{8} 1 \right).\]

The first sum is a geometric series with the first term 10 and common ratio 10:

The second sum is simply the sum of 8 ones:

\[\sum_{k=1}^{8} 1 = 8.\]

Substituting these back into the expression, we get:

Therefore, the sum \(\frac{10^9 - 82}{81}\) is divisible by 9, and the remainder when it is divided by 9 is 0. Since \(n\) must satisfy \(0 \le n < 9\) and \(n\) is congruent to the sum modulo 9, the value of \(n\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to factor the quadratic expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) into the form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). Let's start by expanding the factored form and then comparing coefficients with the original quadratic expression.

First, expand \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\):
\[
(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24 = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24
\]

Now, we compare the coefficients of the expanded form with the original quadratic expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
\[
ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24 = 10x^2 - x - 24
\]

From this, we can see that the coefficients of \(x^2\) and the constant term are already matching. Therefore, we need to match the coefficients of \(x\):
\[
3A - 8B = -1
\]

We also know that \(AB = 10\). Now we have a system of equations:
1. \(AB = 10\)
2. \(3A - 8B = -1\)

We can solve this system by expressing \(A\) in terms of \(B\) from the first equation:
\[
A = \frac{10}{B}
\]

Next, substitute \(A = \frac{10}{B}\) into the second equation:
\[
3\left(\frac{10}{B}\right) - 8B = -1
\]
\[
\frac{30}{B} - 8B = -1
\]

To clear the fraction, multiply every term by \(B\):
\[
30 - 8B^2 = -B
\]
\[
8B^2 - B - 30 = 0
\]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(8B^2 - B - 30 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 8\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -30\):
\[
B = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-30)}}{2 \cdot 8}
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16}
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16}
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions for \(B\):
\[
B = \frac{1 + 31}{16} = \frac{32}{16} = 2
\]
\[
B = \frac{1 - 31}{16} = \frac{-30}{16} = -\frac{15}{8}
\]

Since \(B\) must be a whole number, we have \(B = 2\). Now substitute \(B = 2\) back into the equation \(A = \frac{10}{B}\):
\[
A = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

Now we have \(A = 5\) and \(B = 2\). We need to find \(AB + B\):
\[
AB + B = 5 \cdot 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12

"To determine the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} \), we will first analyze the expression and then simplify it.

First, let's consider the polynomial \( p(x) \) at specific values of \( x \):

1. Evaluate \( p(a) \):
\[
p(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
\]

2. Evaluate \( p(b) \):
\[
p(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.
\]

3. Evaluate \( p(c) \):
\[
p(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

From these evaluations, we see that \( p(a) = 1 \), \( p(b) = 1 \), and \( p(c) = 1 \). This means that the polynomial \( p(x) - 1 \) has roots at \( x = a \), \( x = b \), and \( x = c \). Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct, the polynomial \( p(x) - 1 \) must be a constant multiple of \( (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
p(x) - 1 = k(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)
\]
for some constant \( k \). To find \( k \), we can consider the leading term of \( p(x) \). The polynomial \( p(x) \) is a sum of three rational functions, each of which is a quadratic polynomial divided by a constant. The leading term of each rational function is \( x^2 \), so the leading term of \( p(x) \) is \( x^2 \). Since the leading term of \( k(x - a)(x - b)(x - c) \) is \( kx^3 \), we must have \( k = 0 \) if the degree of \( p(x) \) were 3 or higher. However, we need to check if \( p(x) \) can be a quadratic polynomial.

Let's assume \( p(x) = x^2 + bx + c \). Then:
\[
p(a) = a^2 + ba + c = 1,
\]
\[
p(b) = b^2 + bb + c = 1,
\]
\[
p(c) = c^2 + bc + c = 1.
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
a^2 + ba + c = 1,
\]
\[
b^2 + bb + c = 1,
\]
\[
c^2 + bc + c = 1.
\]
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[
b^2 - a^2 + b - a = 0 \implies (b - a)(b + a + 1) = 0.
\]
Since \( a \neq b \), we have \( b + a + 1 = 0 \). Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third, we get:
\[
c^2 - b^2 + c - b = 0 \implies (c - b)(c + b + 1) = 0.
\]
Since \( b \neq c \), we have \( c + b + 1 = 0 \). Finally, subtracting the third equation from the first, we get:
\[
a^2 - c^2 + a - c = 0 \implies (a - c)(a + c + 1) = 0.
\]
Since \( a \neq c \), we have \( a + c + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have the system:
\[
b + a + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
c + b + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
a + c + 1 = 0.
\]
Adding these equations, we get:
\[
2(a + b + c) + 3 = 0 \implies a + b + c = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]
Substituting \( b = -a - 1 \) and \( c = -b - 1 = a + 2 \) into the third equation, we get:
\[
a + (a + 2) + 1 = 0 \implies 2a + 3 = 0 \implies a = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]
Then \( b = -a - 1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( c = a + 2 = \frac{1}{2} \). However, this contradicts the assumption that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct. Therefore, the polynomial \( p(x) \) cannot be a quadratic polynomial.

Thus, the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",0,"[0, '0']",False
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{4+6a}{5} - \frac{1+3a}{4}\) into a single fraction, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 5 and 4, and their least common multiple is 20. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 20.

First, we rewrite \(\frac{4+6a}{5}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[
\frac{4+6a}{5} = \frac{(4+6a) \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} = \frac{16 + 24a}{20}

Next, we rewrite \(\frac{1+3a}{4}\) with a denominator of 20:
\[

2. **Solve the absolute value equation:**
   The equation \( |x-4| = 12 \) means that \( x-4 \) can be either 12 or -12. Therefore, we can write two separate equations:

"To find \(\cos \angle RPS\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\). Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are supplementary angles (they add up to \(180^\circ\)), we can use the identity for the cosine of a supplementary angle, which states that \(\cos(180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta\). Therefore, \(\cos \angle RPS = -\cos \angle RPQ\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPQ\). We use the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine, which states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\). Substituting \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\) into the identity, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1

\[
\frac{49}{625} + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1
\]
\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1 - \frac{49}{625}

\[
\cos^2 \angle RPQ = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625}

"To determine the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the points on a circle and the conditions under which two chords intersect.

First, let's label the points on the circle as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a clockwise order. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the other three points relative to it. This leaves us with \(3!\) (6) permutations of \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

Out of these 6 permutations, only 2 will result in the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the permutations where the points appear in an alternating pattern. Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

The shaded region is a segment of the larger circle. The area of a segment of a circle is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. Let \(\theta\) be the central angle of the sector in radians. The area of the sector is:

\]
The area of the triangle is:
\[

Thus, the area of the segment is:

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. The diameter of the spherical tank is 12 cm (since the radius is 6 cm), so the radius is 6 cm. Substituting the radius into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The radius of the cylindrical container is 1.5 cm (since the diameter is 3 cm), and the height is 8 cm. Substituting the radius and height into the formula, we get:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's denote:
\[
\alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \arcsin 0.5.

This means:
\[

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha.

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

Now, we can substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},

Now, we can find the product:

4. \( 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 6d + 2e \) or \( 9a + 3b + 32 = 6d + 2e \).
We can simplify these equations further:
1. \( a + b + 6 = d + e \),
2. \( 16a + 4b + 69 = 4d + e \),
3. \( 4a + 2b + 13 = 4d + 2e \),
4. \( 9a + 3b + 32 = 6d + 2e \).
From equation 1, we can express \( e \) as:
\[ e = a + b + 6 - d. \]
Substituting \( e \) into the other equations, we get:
2. \( 16a + 4b + 69 = 4d + a + b + 6 - d \) or \( 15a + 3b + 63 = 3d \) or \( 5a + b + 21 = d \),
3. \( 4a + 2b + 13 = 4d + 2(a + b + 6 - d) \) or \( 4a + 2b + 13 = 4d + 2a + 2b + 12 - 2d \) or \( 2a + 1 = 2d \) or \( a + \frac{1}{2} = d \) or \( d = a + \frac{1}{2} \),
4. \( 9a + 3b + 32 = 6d + 2(a + b + 6 - d) \) or \( 9a + 3b + 32 = 6d + 2a + 2b + 12 - 2d \) or \( 7a + b + 20 = 4d \).
Substituting \( d = a + \frac{1}{2} \) into the equations, we get:
2. \( 5a + b + 21 = a + \frac{1}{2} \) or \( 4a + b + 20.5 = 0 \) or \( b = -4a - 20.5 \),
4. \( 7a + (-4a - 20.5) + 20 = 4(a + \frac{1}{2}) \) or \( 3a - 0.5 = 4a + 2 \) or \( -a = 2.5 \) or \( a = -2.5 \).
Substituting \( a = -2.5 \) into \( b = -4a - 20.5 \), we get:
\[ b = -4(-2.5) - 20.5 = 10 - 20.5 = -10.5. \]
Substituting \( a = -2.5 \) into \( d = a + \frac{1}{2} \), we get:
\[ d = -2.5 + \frac{1}{2} = -2. \]
Substituting \( a = -2.5 \), \( b = -10.5 \), and \( d = -2 \) into \( e = a + b + 6 - d \), we get:
\[ e = -2.5 - 10.5 + 6 + 2 = -5. \]
Thus, the polynomial \( P(x) \) is:
\[ P(x) = x^3 - 2.5x^2 - 10.5x + 5. \]
Finally, we find \( P(5) \):
\[ P(5) = 5^3 - 2.5(5^2) - 10.5(5) + 5 = 125 - 62.5 - 52.5 + 5 = 15. \]
Therefore, the value of \( P(5) \) is:

"To determine the number of distinct values that the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) can take for \( x \in [0, \infty) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the expression inside the floor function as \( x \) varies.

First, consider the expression \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \):
- For \( x = 0 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^0 = 1 \).
- For \( x > 0 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is a negative number because the exponent is positive and the base is negative.

Since \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is negative for \( x > 0 \), the floor function \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) will always be a negative integer or zero.

Let's evaluate the function for small positive values of \( x \):
- As \( x \) approaches 0 from the right, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) approaches 1 from below. Therefore, \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) approaches 0.
- As \( x \) increases, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) becomes more negative. For example:
  - For \( x = 1 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^1 = -\frac{5}{8} \approx -0.625 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^1 \right\rfloor = -1 \).
  - For \( x = 2 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{64} \approx 0.390625 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^2 \right\rfloor = 0 \).
  - For \( x = 3 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^3 = -\frac{125}{512} \approx -0.244140625 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^3 \right\rfloor = -1 \).
  - For \( x = 4 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{4096} \approx 0.152587890625 \), so \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^4 \right\rfloor = 0 \).

From these calculations, we observe that \( \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) can take the values 0 and -1. For \( x > 4 \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) becomes even smaller in magnitude, and the floor function will continue to yield 0 or -1.

Therefore, the distinct values that \( f(x) \) can take are 0 and -1. The number of distinct values is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False

"To determine the number of different ways to form a 5-member committee with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible committees and then subtracting the number of committees that do not meet the criteria (i.e., committees that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from the 14 members (8Cumhuriyetçi + 6 Demokrat). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a committee that is all from one party. There are two cases to consider: a committee all from the Cumhuriyetçi and a committee all from the Demokrat.

The number of ways to form a committee all from the Cumhuriyetçi is \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to form a committee all from the Demokrat is \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Add these two results together to get the total number of committees that are all from one party:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract the number of committees that are all from one party from the total number of committees to get the number of committees with at least one member from each party:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940
\]

Thus, the number of different ways to form a 5-member committee with at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To simplify the given expression \(\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}+\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}+\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{5}}}\), we will break it down step by step.

First, simplify each term inside the numerator:
1. Simplify \(\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{16 \cdot 5}} = \dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{5\sqrt{5}}{20} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.
   \]
2. Simplify \(\dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{845} = \sqrt{169 \cdot 5} = 13\sqrt{5},
   \]
   so
   \[
   \dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9} = \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9}.
   \]
3. Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
   \]

Now, substitute these simplified terms back into the expression inside the numerator:
\[
\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{80}} + \dfrac{\sqrt{845}}{9} + \sqrt{45} = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\sqrt{5}.
\]

To add these terms, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Convert each term to have a denominator of 36:
\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{4} = \dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
\dfrac{13\sqrt{5}}{9} = \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36},
\]
\[
3\sqrt{5} = \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\dfrac{9\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{52\sqrt{5}}{36} + \dfrac{108\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{(9 + 52 + 108)\sqrt{5}}{36} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}.
\]

So, the expression inside the numerator is \(\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}\). Now, substitute this back into the original expression:
\[
\sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}}}.
\]

Simplify the fraction inside the square root:
\[
\dfrac{\dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36}}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169\sqrt{5}}{36} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{169}{36}.
\]

Now, take the square root of the result:
\[
\sqrt{\dfrac{169}{36}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{169}}{\sqrt{36}} = \dfrac{13}{6}.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{6}}\).","[13/6, '\\frac{13}{6}']",\frac{13}{6},"[13/6, '\\frac{13}{6}']",True
"To find the minimum value of the expression \((x + y)(y + z)\) given the condition \(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\), we start by using the method of Lagrange multipliers or by making a strategic substitution. Here, we will use a substitution to simplify the problem.

First, let's assume \(x = a\), \(y = b\), and \(z = c\) such that \(abc(a + b + c) = 1\). We need to minimize \((a + b)(b + c)\).

To simplify, let's consider the case when \(x = y = z\). If \(x = y = z\), then the condition becomes \(x^3 \cdot 3x = 1\), which simplifies to \(3x^4 = 1\) or \(x^4 = \frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, \(x = \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}}\).

Now, we substitute \(x = y = z = \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}}\) into the expression \((x + y)(y + z)\):
\[
(x + y)(y + z) = \left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}} + \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}}\right)\left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}} + \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = 2\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}} = 4\left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^2 = 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

To confirm that this is indeed the minimum value, we can use the AM-GM inequality or other optimization techniques, but the symmetry and the fact that the function is convex in the positive domain suggest that this is the minimum.

Thus, the minimum value of \((x + y)(y + z)\) is \(\boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}}\).","[(4*sqrt(3))/3, '\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) in the continued fraction representation of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \), we start with the equation:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

First, we determine the integer part \( a \) of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \). Since \( 1^3 = 1 \) and \( 2^3 = 8 \), it follows that \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \). Therefore, \( a = 1 \). This gives us:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

Next, we isolate the fractional part by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2} - 1 = \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}
\]

Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find \( b \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \) (since \( (\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3 = (\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)(\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1) \)):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1^3} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1}{2 - 1} = \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 = b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}
\]

Since \( b \) is the integer part of \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \), we need to find the value of \( \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \). We know that:

\[
1^3 = 1, \quad 2^3 = 8, \quad 3^3 = 27
\]

Therefore, \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \) and \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{4} < 2 \). Adding these inequalities, we get:

\[
3 < \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4} < 4
\]

Adding 1 to each part of the inequality, we obtain:

\[
4 < \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4} + 1 < 5

Thus, the integer part \( b \) is 4. Therefore, the value of \( b \) is:

"To find the remainder when the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we first need to understand the pattern in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \(F_1 = 1\), \(F_2 = 1\), and \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\) for \(n \geq 3\).

Let's compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_3 &\equiv F_2 + F_1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}, \\
F_4 &\equiv F_3 + F_2 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \\
F_5 &\equiv F_4 + F_3 \equiv 3 + 2 \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_6 &\equiv F_5 + F_4 \equiv 1 + 3 \equiv 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \\
F_7 &\equiv F_6 + F_5 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_8 &\equiv F_7 + F_6 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}.
\end{aligned}
\]

We observe that \(F_7 \equiv F_1 \pmod{4}\) and \(F_8 \equiv F_2 \pmod{4}\). This suggests that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6. To confirm, let's compute a few more terms:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_9 &\equiv F_8 + F_7 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{10} &\equiv F_9 + F_8 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{11} &\equiv F_{10} + F_9 \equiv 3 + 2 \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
F_{12} &\equiv F_{11} + F_{10} \equiv 1 + 3 \equiv 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
\end{aligned}
\]

 indeed, \(F_9 \equiv F_3 \pmod{4}\), \(F_{10} \equiv F_4 \pmod{4}\), \(F_{11} \equiv F_5 \pmod{4}\), and \(F_{12} \equiv F_6 \pmod{4}\). Therefore, the sequence is periodic with a period of 6.

To find the remainder when the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term is divided by 4, we need to determine the position of 100 within the period. We do this by computing \(100 \mod 6\):

\[
100 \div 6 = 16 \text{ remainder } 4.
\]

So, \(100 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\). This means that \(F_{100} \equiv F_4 \pmod{4}\). From our earlier computation, we know that \(F_4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\).

Therefore, the remainder when the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the sum of these three integers:
\[x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3.\]

According to the problem, when the product is divided by the sum, the result is 24. Therefore, we can write another equation:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x + (x+1) + (x+2)} = 24.\]

Substituting the product and the sum into the equation, we get:
\[\frac{120}{3x + 3} = 24.\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3x + 3\):
\[120 = 24(3x + 3).\]

Next, we distribute the 24 on the right side:
\[120 = 72x + 72.\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract 72 from both sides:
\[48 = 72x.\]

Then, we divide both sides by 72:
\[x = \frac{48}{72} = \frac{2}{3}.\]

Since \(x\) must be an integer, we realize there was an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct integer solution.

Given the correct integer solution, we should recheck the problem constraints and ensure the correct interpretation. The correct interpretation should be that the three integers are indeed integers, and the correct solution should be re-evaluated.

Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct integer solution:
The correct integers are 4, 5, and 6. The product is \(4 \times 5 \times 6 = 120\), and the sum is \(4 + 5 + 6 = 15\). The average is \(\frac{120}{15} = 8\).

"To convert the decimal number \(999_{10}\) to its base 6 equivalent, we need to repeatedly divide the number by 6 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will form the digits of the base 6 number, read from bottom to top.

Here are the steps:

1. Divide 999 by 6:
   \[
   999 \div 6 = 166 \text{ remainder } 3
   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 3.

2. Divide 166 by 6:
   \[
   166 \div 6 = 27 \text{ remainder } 4

   So, the next digit is 4.

3. Divide 27 by 6:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the parabola \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \) that is the reflection of the parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) across the line \( y = k \). We will then find the sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f \) in terms of \( k \).

### Step 1: Reflect the Parabola
The parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is reflected across the line \( y = k \). The line \( y = k \) is a horizontal line, so the reflection will change the sign of the vertical distance from any point on the parabola to the line \( y = k \).

### Step 2: Find the Reflection Point
Consider a point \( (x, y) \) on the original parabola. The vertical distance from this point to the line \( y = k \) is \( y - k \). The reflected point will be at a distance \( -(y - k) \) from the line \( y = k \), which gives the coordinates \( (x, 2k - y) \).

### Step 3: Substitute the Original Point
Since \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the coordinates of the reflected point are \( (x, 2k - (ax^2 + bx + c)) \). Simplifying this, we get:
\[
(2k - ax^2 - bx - c, x)
\]

### Step 4: Write the Equation of the Reflected Parabola
The reflected parabola is obtained by replacing \( y \) with \( 2k - y \) in the original equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). Therefore, the equation of the reflected parabola is:
\[
2k - y = ax^2 + bx + c
\]
Rearranging this equation to solve for \( y \), we get:
\[
y = 2k - ax^2 - bx - c
\]

### Step 5: Identify the Coefficients
By comparing the equation \( y = 2k - ax^2 - bx - c \) with the general form \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \), we can identify the coefficients:
\[
d = -a, \quad e = -b, \quad f = 2k - c
\]

### Step 6: Find the Sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f \)
Now, we substitute the values of \( d \), \( e \), and \( f \) into the sum:
\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (2k - c)
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
a + b + c - a - b + 2k - c = 2k

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\), we can use the properties of the dot product and the cosine function. Let's denote the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) by \(\theta\).

First, we know the following:
1. The angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\).
2. The angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\).

We can use the dot product formula \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\| \cos \phi\), where \(\phi\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express the dot products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]
\[
\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos 84^\circ
\]
\[
(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

We can also express \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\) in terms of \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}\):
\[
(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

Now, we can use the dot product formula for \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\):
\[
(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

We also know that:
\[
(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

Using the dot product formula for \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\):
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| - \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

We also know that:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

Using the Law of Cosines in the triangle formed by \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 84^\circ
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 84^\circ
\]

Simplifying:
\[
-2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 29^\circ = -2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos 84^\circ
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-2 \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|\):
\[
\cos 29^\circ = \cos 84^\circ
\]

This is not possible, so we need to use the correct approach. The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). The angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 29^\circ - 84^\circ = 67^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{67^\circ}\).","[67, '67^\\circ']",55^\circ,"[55, '55']",False

Next, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(n)\) as \(n\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{n \to a^+} f(n) = 7a - 12. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(n = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12. \]

Now, we solve this equation for \(a\):
\[ 4a + 3 = 7a - 12, \]
\[ 3 + 12 = 7a - 4a, \]
\[ 15 = 3a, \]
\[ a = 5. \]

"To find \( t(g(16)) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine the value of \( g(16) \).
2. Then, use the result from step 1 to find \( t \) of that value.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = \sqrt{x} \]
So, we substitute \( x = 16 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

Now that we have \( g(16) = 4 \), we move to step 2. We need to find \( t(4) \). The function \( t(x) \) is given by:
\[ t(x) = 3 - g(x) \]
Since \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
So, we substitute \( g(4) = 2 \) into the function \( t(x) \):
\[ t(4) = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To simplify the expression \(4(3r^3 + 5r - 6) - 6(2r^3 - r^2 + 4r)\), we will follow these steps:

1. Distribute the constants 4 and -6 through their respective parentheses.
2. Combine like terms.

Let's start with the first step:

Distribute the 4 through the first set of parentheses:
\[4(3r^3 + 5r - 6) = 4 \cdot 3r^3 + 4 \cdot 5r + 4 \cdot (-6) = 12r^3 + 20r - 24.\]

Distribute the -6 through the second set of parentheses:
\[-6(2r^3 - r^2 + 4r) = -6 \cdot 2r^3 + (-6) \cdot (-r^2) + (-6) \cdot 4r = -12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r.\]

Now, we combine the results from the two distributions:
\[12r^3 + 20r - 24 - 12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r.\]

Next, we combine the like terms. The \(r^3\) terms cancel each other out:
\[12r^3 - 12r^3 + 6r^2 + 20r - 24r - 24 = 6r^2 - 4r - 24.\]

"To calculate \(\dbinom{31}{28}\), we can use the property of binomial coefficients that states \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}\). This property allows us to simplify the calculation by choosing the smaller of the two values for \(k\). In this case, since \(28\) is less than \(31\), we can rewrite \(\dbinom{31}{28}\) as \(\dbinom{31}{3}\).

The binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{31}{3}\) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Substituting \(n = 31\) and \(k = 3\), we get:

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31!}{3!(31-3)!} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot 28!}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the \(28!\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29 \times 28!}{3! \times 28!} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{3!}

Next, we need to calculate \(3!\):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[

"To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people in a square such that each side of the square has exactly 2 people, we need to consider the symmetries of the square. The square has 4 rotational symmetries (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and 4 reflectional symmetries (across the midlines and the diagonals), giving a total of 8 symmetries.

First, we calculate the total number of arrangements without considering any symmetries. This is simply the number of ways to assign 8 people to 8 positions, which is \(8!\):

\[
8! = 40320
\]

Next, we need to account for the symmetries of the square. Since there are 8 symmetries, each distinct configuration will be counted 8 times in the total number of arrangements. Therefore, we divide the total number of arrangements by 8:

\[
\frac{8!}{8} = \frac{40320}{8} = 5040

Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people in a square such that each side of the square has exactly 2 people is \(\boxed{5040}\).","[5040, '5040']",10080,"[10080, '10080']",False
"To find the units digit of \(18^6\), we only need to consider the units digit of the base number, which is 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the units digit of \(8^6\).

Next, we observe the pattern in the units digits of the powers of 8:
\[

8^1 &= 8 \quad \text{(units digit is 8)}, \\
8^2 &= 64 \quad \text{(units digit is 4)}, \\

\]
We see that the units digits repeat every 4 numbers: 8, 4, 2, 6. To find the units digit of \(8^6\), we need to determine the position of 6 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 6 is divided by 4:
\[
6 \div 4 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2.
\]
The remainder is 2, so \(8^6\) has the same units digit as \(8^2\). From our pattern, we know that the units digit of \(8^2\) is 4.

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, \( AC^2 = AB^2 = 121 + BM^2 \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \), so:
\[
\angle DBC + \angle DCB + \angle BDC = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC + \angle DCB + 3\theta = 180^\circ.
\]
Since \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB \) (because \( D \) lies on the altitude \( AM \) and \( \triangle BDC \) is symmetric about \( AM \)), we have:
\[
2\angle DBC + 3\theta = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}.
\]

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \). Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BAD = \theta \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{10}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle. By symmetry and the given conditions, we can deduce that \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Since \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB = 30^\circ \). Therefore, \( BD = \frac{BC}{2} \) and \( DC = \frac{BC}{2} \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 = \left( \frac{BC}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{BC}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{2} \implies BC^2 = 2 \left( \frac{BC^2}{2} \right) \implies BC = 2 \times 10 = 20.
\]
Thus, \( AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 10^2} = \sqrt{221} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2 \sqrt{221} + 20.

2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where the two mathematics books are next to each other.**

However, the problem states that the sum of the 27 ardışık pozitif tam sayının toplamı \(3^7\). First, we calculate \(3^7\):

So, the sum of the 27 ardışık pozitif tam sayının toplamı is 2187. The middle number of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number in the sequence. If we let the first number be \(a\), then the 14th number is \(a + 13\). The sum of the first 27 numbers can also be expressed as:

\[
\frac{(x + y)[x^2 + (x + 4y)^2]}{ab}.

Since \(a + b = x\), we can express \(ab\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\) using the AM-GM inequality, but it is more straightforward to use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry to find the critical points. Let's assume \(a = b\) for simplicity and symmetry. Then \(x = 2a\) and the expression becomes:

\[

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

   Since \(u = \frac{x}{2} - 3\), the circle in the \(u\)-\(y\) plane corresponds to a circle in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane after a horizontal stretch and translation. Specifically, the circle \((u - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 10\) in the \(u\)-\(y\) plane translates to the circle \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\) in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The equation \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\) represents a circle in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

Therefore, the conic section represented by the equation is a \(\boxed{\text{circle}}\).","[circle, '\\text{circle}']",\text{ellipse},[],False
"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have the system of equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(s\) in terms of \(p\):
\[
s = \frac{24}{p}.
\]

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 3p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 3p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{24(576 - 3p^3)}{p^3},

\[
-8p^3 = 24(576 - 3p^3),

\[

\[
64p^3 = 13824,

"To find the value of \( b \) in the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix}\), we need to determine the direction vector of the line passing through the points \( A = (-5, 4) \) and \( B = (-1, 3) \).

The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) of a line passing through two points \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\ y_2 - y_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find a scalar \( k \) such that the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix}\) is a scalar multiple of \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\). That is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the side length of an equilateral triangle that is inscribed in the parabola \( y = \frac{x^2}{8} \) such that one of its vertices is at the vertex of the parabola. Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle by \( s \).

Since the vertex of the parabola is at the origin \((0,0)\), one of the vertices of the equilateral triangle is at \((0,0)\). The other two vertices of the equilateral triangle will be symmetric about the y-axis and will lie on the parabola. Let these vertices be \((x, y)\) and \((-x, y)\). Since these points lie on the parabola, we have:
\[ y = \frac{x^2}{8}. \]

The distance between the points \((x, y)\) and \((-x, y)\) is the side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, we have:
\[ s = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - y)^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2} = 2x. \]

The distance between the point \((x, y)\) and the origin \((0,0)\) is also equal to the side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, we have:
\[ s = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{x^2}{8} \) into the equation, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{x^2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64x^2 + x^4}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 64x^2}}{8} = \frac{x\sqrt{x^2 + 64}}{8}. \]

Since we also have \( s = 2x \), we can set the two expressions for \( s \) equal to each other:
\[ 2x = \frac{x\sqrt{x^2 + 64}}{8}. \]

Assuming \( x \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x \):
\[ 2 = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 64}}{8}. \]

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get:
\[ 16 = \sqrt{x^2 + 64}. \]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ 256 = x^2 + 64. \]

Subtracting 64 from both sides, we get:
\[ 192 = x^2. \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ x = \sqrt{192} = 8\sqrt{3}. \]

Since \( s = 2x \), we have:
\[ s = 2 \cdot 8\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}. \]

Therefore, the side length of the equilateral triangle is \(\boxed{16\sqrt{3}}\).","[16*sqrt(3), '16\\sqrt{3}']",16 \sqrt{3},"[16, '16']",False
"To determine the probability that Dan and Freddie both pass the exam, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each passing the exam and then use the rule for the probability of the intersection of two independent events.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number by \( x \). The reverse of the number \( x \) is denoted by \( \text{rev}(x) \). According to the problem, the sum of the number and its reverse, plus three, is equal to the number divided by 7. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + \text{rev}(x) + 3 = \frac{x}{7} \]

First, we need to express the reverse of the number \( x \) in a general form. If \( x \) is a two-digit number, we can write \( x \) as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits of \( x \) and \( a \neq 0 \). The reverse of \( x \) would then be \( 10b + a \). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[ (10a + b) + (10b + a) + 3 = \frac{10a + b}{7} \]

Combining like terms on the left side, we have:

\[ 11a + 11b + 3 = \frac{10a + b}{7} \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 7:

\[ 7(11a + 11b + 3) = 10a + b \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ 77a + 77b + 21 = 10a + b \]

Next, we move all terms involving \( a \) and \( b \) to one side of the equation and constant terms to the other side:

\[ 77a - 10a + 77b - b = -21 \]

Simplifying, we have:

\[ 67a + 76b = -21 \]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy this equation. We can test possible values for \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

"To find the equation of the image of the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) under a reflection about the point \((4,1)\), we start by determining the image of a general point \((x,y)\) on the circle. The image of a point \((x,y)\) reflected about the point \((4,1)\) is \((8-x,2-y)\). This is because the midpoint of the segment joining \((x,y)\) and its image \((x',y')\) is \((4,1)\), so we have:
\[
\left( \frac{x + x'}{2}, \frac{y + y'}{2} \right) = (4,1).
\]
Solving these equations for \(x'\) and \(y'\), we get:
\[
x' = 8 - x \quad \text{and} \quad y' = 2 - y.
\]
Now, we substitute \(x = 8 - x'\) and \(y = 2 - y'\) into the equation of the original circle:
\[
(8 - x')^2 + (2 - y')^2 = 25.
\]
Expanding both squares, we get:
\[

First, recall the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers:
\[
\gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \cdot b
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
210 \cdot 210^3 = a \cdot b
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a \cdot b = 210^4
\]
Since \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\), we can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their prime factorizations. Let:
\[
a = 210 \cdot m \quad \text{and} \quad b = 210 \cdot n
\]
where \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation \(a \cdot b = 210^4\), we get:
\[
(210 \cdot m) \cdot (210 \cdot n) = 210^4

This simplifies to:
\[
210^2 \cdot m \cdot n = 210^4
\]
Dividing both sides by \(210^2\), we obtain:
\[
m \cdot n = 210^2
\]
Next, we need to find the prime factorization of \(210^2\):
\[
210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \quad \text{so} \quad 210^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2

The number of positive divisors of \(210^2\) is given by:
\[
(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 81
\]
Each pair \((m, n)\) such that \(m \cdot n = 210^2\) corresponds to a unique pair \((a, b)\) where \(a = 210 \cdot m\) and \(b = 210 \cdot n\). Since \(a < b\), \(m\) must be less than \(n\). Therefore, we only consider the pairs \((m, n)\) where \(m < n\).

The number of such pairs is half the number of divisors of \(210^2\) (since each pair \((m, n)\) is counted twice, once as \((m, n)\) and once as \((n, m)\), and we only want the pairs where \(m < n\)):

"To find the sum of the series \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \dots + 195 + 197 + 199\) and then determine the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the series as an arithmetic series:**
   The given series is an arithmetic series of odd numbers where the first term \(a = 1\), the common difference \(d = 2\), and the last term \(l = 199\).

2. **Find the number of terms in the series:**
   The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = a + (n-1)d
   \]
   Setting \(a_n = 199\), we get:
   \[
   199 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   199 = 1 + 2(n-1) \implies 198 = 2(n-1) \implies 99 = n-1 \implies n = 100
   \]
   So, there are 100 terms in the series.

3. **Find the sum of the series:**
   The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)
   \]
   Substituting the values \(n = 100\), \(a = 1\), and \(l = 199\):
   \[
   S = \frac{100}{2} (1 + 199) = 50 \cdot 200 = 10000
   \]

4. **Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 7:**
   To find the remainder when 10000 is divided by 7, we first find the quotient:
   \[
   10000 \div 7 = 1428.5714

   The integer part of the quotient is 1428. Now, we multiply 1428 by 7 to find the product:

   The remainder is the difference between 10000 and 9996:

"To find the maximum area of a triangle with two sides of length 8 and a third side of integer length, we can use Heron's formula for the area of a triangle. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:

\[ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:

\[ s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \]

In this problem, let \(a = 8\), \(b = 8\), and \(c\) be the integer length of the third side. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:

\[ s = \frac{8+8+c}{2} = 8 + \frac{c}{2} \]

For \(s\) to be an integer, \(c\) must be an even number. Additionally, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which gives us the following conditions:

1. \(a + b > c \implies 8 + 8 > c \implies c < 16\)
2. \(a + c > b \implies 8 + c > 8 \implies c > 0\) (which is always true since \(c\) is a positive integer)
3. \(b + c > a \implies 8 + c > 8 \implies c > 0\) (which is always true since \(c\) is a positive integer)

Combining these, we get \(0 < c < 16\). Since \(c\) must be even, the possible values for \(c\) are \(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\).

To maximize the area, we need to consider the case when the triangle is isosceles with \(c\) as the base. The area of the triangle can be expressed as:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times \sqrt{8^2 - \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times \sqrt{64 - \frac{c^2}{4}} = \frac{c}{4} \sqrt{256 - c^2} \]

  \[ A = \frac{8}{4} \sqrt{256 - 64} = 2 \sqrt{192} = 2 \times 8\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3} \approx 27.71 \]

"To determine the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h

where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides).

Let's assume the lengths of the two parallel sides are \( b_1 = 10 \) units and \( b_2 = 6 \) units, and the height is \( h = 4 \) units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

"To find the maximum value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) given that \( |ax^2 + bx + c| \le 1 \) for \( 0 \le x \le 1 \), we need to consider the values of the quadratic polynomial at the endpoints and the vertex within the interval \([0, 1]\).

First, let's evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 0 \), \( x = 1 \), and the vertex \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) (assuming it lies within the interval \([0, 1]\)).

1. At \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   |c| \le 1
   \]

2. At \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   |a + b + c| \le 1
   \]

3. At the vertex \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) (assuming \( 0 \le -\frac{b}{2a} \le 1 \)):
   \[
   \left| a \left( -\frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 + b \left( -\frac{b}{2a} \right) + c \right| = \left| \frac{b^2}{4a} - \frac{b^2}{2a} + c \right| = \left| c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \right| \le 1
   \]

We need to maximize \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) under these constraints. Let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \). This polynomial satisfies the conditions:
- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  |P(0)| = |1| = 1
  \]
- At \( x = 1 \):
  \[
  |P(1)| = |1| = 1
  \]
- At the vertex \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):
  \[
  P\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1

  \[
  |P\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)| = |-1| = 1

For the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \), we have \( a = 8 \), \( b = -8 \), and \( c = 1 \). Therefore,
\[
|a| + |b| + |c| = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17

To confirm that this is indeed the maximum, we can consider other possible polynomials and their values at the endpoints and the vertex, but the polynomial \( P(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1 \) provides the maximum value for \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) under the given constraints.

Thus, the maximum value of \( |a| + |b| + |c| \) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To determine which result is correct, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\) and compare it with the incorrect result \(\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i\).

First, let's evaluate the correct expression \(\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\). To do this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is \(1-2i\):

\[
\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i} = \frac{(-3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}
\]

The denominator simplifies as follows:

\[
(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 1 + 4 = 5
\]

Now, we expand the numerator:

\[
(-3+4i)(1-2i) = -3 \cdot 1 + (-3) \cdot (-2i) + 4i \cdot 1 + 4i \cdot (-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2 = -3 + 10i - 8(-1) = -3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5 + 10i}{5} = \frac{5}{5} + \frac{10i}{5} = 1 + 2i
\]

Therefore, the correct value of \(\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\) is \(1 + 2i\).

Next, let's compare this with the incorrect result \(\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i\). We can evaluate \(\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}\) in a similar manner:

\[
\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i} = \frac{(3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)} = \frac{3 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot (-2i) + 4i \cdot 1 + 4i \cdot (-2i)}{5} = \frac{3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2}{5} = \frac{3 - 2i - 8(-1)}{5} = \frac{3 - 2i + 8}{5} = \frac{11 - 2i}{5} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i
\]

The incorrect result is indeed \(\frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i\).

Since the correct value of \(\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\) is \(1 + 2i\), the correct answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the positive divisors of \( A \) and compare it to the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \).

First, let's consider the number \( A = 500 \). We start by finding its prime factorization:
\[
500 = 2^2 \times 5^3
\]

### Step 1: Sum of the Positive Divisors of \( A \)
The sum of the positive divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is given by:
\[
(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \cdots + p_k^{e_k})
\]

For \( A = 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \), the sum of the positive divisors is:
\[
(1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3)
\]

Calculating each term separately:
\[
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
\]
\[
1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156
\]

Now, multiply these results together:
\[
7 \times 156 = 1092
\]

So, the sum of the positive divisors of \( 500 \) is \( 1092 \).

### Step 2: Sum of the Distinct Prime Divisors of \( A \)
The distinct prime divisors of \( 500 \) are \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). Therefore, the sum of the distinct prime divisors is:
\[
2 + 5 = 7
\]

### Step 3: Comparison
We need to find the sum of the positive divisors of \( A \) and compare it to the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). From the calculations above, we have:
\[
\text{Sum of the positive divisors of } A = 1092
\]
\[
\text{Sum of the distinct prime divisors of } A = 7

Thus, the sum of the positive divisors of \( A \) is \(\boxed{1092}\).","[1092, '1092']",25,"[25, '25']",False
"To find the coordinates of the point \( P \) that lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \) and is equidistant from the points \( A(10, -10) \) and \( O(0, 0) \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express the coordinates of \( P \) in terms of a single variable:**
   Since \( P \) lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \), we can write the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, -x + 6) \).

2. **Use the distance formula to set up an equation:**
   The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is given by:
   \[
   PA = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 6 + 10)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2}
   \]
   The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is given by:
   \[
   PO = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (-x + 6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2}
   \]
   Since \( PA = PO \), we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2}
   \]

3. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides:**
   \[
   (x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2 = x^2 + (-x + 6)^2
   \]
   Expanding both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 20x + 100 + x^2 - 32x + 256 = x^2 + x^2 - 12x + 36
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we have:
   \[
   2x^2 - 52x + 356 = 2x^2 - 12x + 36
   \]
   Subtracting \( 2x^2 \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   -52x + 356 = -12x + 36
   \]
   Adding \( 52x \) to both sides, we get:
   \[
   356 = 40x + 36
   \]
   Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   320 = 40x
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 40, we get:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

4. **Find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate:**
   Since \( P \) lies on the line \( y = -x + 6 \), we substitute \( x = 8 \) into the equation:
   \[
   y = -8 + 6 = -2

   Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (8, -2) \).

\[
n = \underbrace{n!^{n!^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}
\]

This means that \(n\) is an exponent tower of \(n!\) repeated \(n!\) times.

### Step 1: Calculate \(4!\)

First, we need to calculate \(4!\):

\[
4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
\]

### Step 2: Determine the ones digit of \(4!\)

Next, we find the ones digit of \(4!\):

\[

Now we need to calculate \(4\) using the definition of theülfaktöriyel \(n\):

### Step 4: Find the ones digit of \(24^{24}\)

To find the ones digit of \(24^{24}\), we only need to consider the ones digit of the base \(24\), which is \(4\). Thus, we need to find the ones digit of \(4^{24}\).

### Step 5: Determine the pattern in the ones digits of powers of 4

We can observe the pattern in the ones digits of the powers of \(4\):

\[
\begin{align*}
4^1 & = 4 \quad \text{(ones digit is 4)} \\

4^3 & = 64 \quad \text{(ones digit is 4)} \\
4^4 & = 256 \quad \text{(ones digit is 6)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The pattern repeats every 2 terms: \(4, 6\).

### Step 6: Determine the position of \(24\) in the pattern

Since \(24\) is even, we can find the position in the repeating pattern:

\[
24 \mod 2 = 0
\]

This means that \(4^{24}\) corresponds to the second position in the repeating pattern, which has a ones digit of \(6\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality will change signs at \(x = 9\), \(x = -9\), and \(x = 0\), \(x = 36\).

Next, we need to determine the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.

   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined, which means these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

In interval notation, the solution is:

"To determine the probability that a triangle with sides of lengths \(1\), \(x\), and \(y\) can be formed, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, for sides \(1\), \(x\), and \(y\), the following inequalities must hold:

1. \(1 + x > y\)
2. \(1 + y > x\)
3. \(x + y > 1\)

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are selected randomly from the interval \([0, 3]\), we can represent the possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) in a coordinate plane where the x-axis corresponds to \(x\) and the y-axis corresponds to \(y\). The region where \(0 \leq x \leq 3\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 3\) forms a square with side length 3, so the area of this square is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

Next, we need to determine the region within this square where the inequalities \(1 + x > y\), \(1 + y > x\), and \(x + y > 1\) are satisfied. Let's analyze each inequality:

2. \(1 + y > x\) can be rewritten as \(y > x - 1\). This is a region above the line \(y = x - 1\).
3. \(x + y > 1\) can be rewritten as \(y > 1 - x\). This is a region above the line \(y = 1 - x\).

The intersection of these three regions forms a triangle. The vertices of this triangle are the points where the lines intersect within the square. To find these points, we solve the system of equations formed by the lines:

- The intersection of \(y = 1 + x\) and \(y = x - 1\) is \((1, 2)\).
- The intersection of \(y = 1 + x\) and \(y = 1 - x\) is \((0, 1)\).
- The intersection of \(y = x - 1\) and \(y = 1 - x\) is \((1, 0)\).

So, the vertices of the triangle are \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((1, 2)\). The area of this triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates of the vertices:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 2) + 1(2 - 1) + 1(1 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 1 + 1 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1
\]

The area of the triangle is 1. Since the area of the square is 9, the probability that a triangle with sides of lengths \(1\), \(x\), and \(y\) can be formed is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{9}

Thus, the probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{9}}\).","[1/9, '\\frac{1}{9}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the field. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. According to the problem, the pist is located at the intersection of the two longest sides and the two shortest sides, and it is equidistant from all four sides. This means that the pist is at the center of the field, and the distance from the pist to any side is half the length of that side.

The pist is also located at the intersection of the two longest sides and the two shortest sides, and it is equidistant from all four sides. This means that the pist is at the center of the field, and the distance from the pist to any side is half the length of that side.

Given that the pist is 400 meters from the longest side, we can write:
\[ \frac{L}{2} = 400 \]
Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = 800 \]

Similarly, the pist is 400 meters from the shortest side, so:
\[ \frac{W}{2} = 400 \]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[ W = 800 \]

Now that we have the dimensions of the field, we can calculate the area of the field. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = L \times W \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( W \), we get:

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10 \) holds, we will follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the inequality:**
   \[

   \]

2. **Move all terms to one side to set the inequality to zero:**
   \[

   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[

3. **Factor the quadratic expression:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-14\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(2\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
   \[
   (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0
   \]

4. **Determine the critical points:**
   The critical points are the values of \( x \) that make the expression equal to zero. These are:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   Solving these, we get:
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2

5. **Test the intervals determined by the critical points:**
   The critical points divide the number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

Kathy has 300 ABD dolar. She wants to convert this amount tosterlans and euros.

First, let's convert the amount tosterlans. Since 1sterlans is equal to 1.64 USD, we can find the amount insterlans by dividing the amount in USD by the exchange rate:
\[
\text{Amount insterlans} = \frac{300 \text{ USD}}{1.64 \text{ USD/sterlan}} \approx 182.93 \text{sterlans}

"To solve the inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \) and determine how many integer solutions it has, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the absolute value inequality**: The inequality \( |x-2| \leq 5.6 \) means that the distance between \( x \) and 2 on the number line is at most 5.6. This can be rewritten as a compound inequality:
   \[
   -5.6 \leq x-2 \leq 5.6

2. **Isolate \( x \) in the compound inequality**: To isolate \( x \), we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:

"To find the value of the function \( f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4 \) at \( x = -2 \), we need to substitute \( -2 \) for \( x \) in the function and then simplify step by step.

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the function:
   \[
   f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4
   \]

2. Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4
   \]

3. Calculate \( (-2)^2 \):
   \[
   (-2)^2 = 4
   \]
   So the expression becomes:
   \[
   f(-2) = 5(4) + 3(-2) + 4
   \]

4. Multiply \( 5 \) by \( 4 \):
   \[
   5(4) = 20

\[
(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \geq 0
\]

We can simplify the left-hand side by expanding both squares:

\[
(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
\[
(x-8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64
\]

Subtracting these two expressions, we get:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 = 10x - 55

So the inequality becomes:

\[
10x - 55 \geq 0

\[

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by recalling that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the length of the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 and the hypotenuse is 5.

Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(T\) as \(a\) and the length of the hypotenuse as \(c\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the side opposite to angle \(T\) is the same as the side adjacent to angle \(R\), and the hypotenuse is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle.

"To find the minimum distance from the point \((0, 0)\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance between a point \((x, y)\) on the curve and the origin \((0, 0)\). The distance \(d\) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9

Substituting this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}

Distributing \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}

Combining like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \(d\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting \(f'(x) = 0\):

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factoring out \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2}

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):

   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6

   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

The vertices \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) form a regular tetrahedron, and the sixth vertex \( F \) is the opposite vertex to \( A \) in the octahedron.

In a regular octahedron, the distance from any vertex to the opposite vertex is equal to the distance between any two vertices of the regular tetrahedron formed by four of the other vertices. Let's denote the side length of the regular tetrahedron \( ABCD \) as \( s \). The distance between any two vertices of a regular tetrahedron is given by:
\[

We need to find the side length \( s \) of the regular tetrahedron \( ABCD \). The distances from \( P \) to \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are 3, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is 11. Since \( E \) is not part of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is constant. This constant is given by:
\[
4 \left(\frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{3s^2}{4}\right) = 3s^2
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octahedron. Therefore, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 4 \left(\frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4}\right) = 3s^2

Calculating the left-hand side, we get:

First, let's express \( z \) as a function of \( y \) for a fixed \( x \):
\[ z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y. \]
Expanding the square term, we get:
\[ z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 2y^2 - 3y = 4x^2 - 4xy - y^2 - 3y. \]
This is a quadratic function in \( y \):
\[ z(x, y) = -y^2 + (4x - 3)y + 4x^2. \]
To find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \( z \), we take the derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( y \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -2y + (4x - 3) = 0. \]
Solving for \( y \), we get:
\[ y = \frac{4x - 3}{2}. \]
This is the value of \( y \) that maximizes \( z \) for a given \( x \). Now, we substitute \( y = \frac{4x - 3}{2} \) back into the function \( z(x, y) \) to find the maximum value of \( z \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ z\left(x, \frac{4x - 3}{2}\right) = -\left(\frac{4x - 3}{2}\right)^2 + (4x - 3)\left(\frac{4x - 3}{2}\right) + 4x^2. \]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ z\left(x, \frac{4x - 3}{2}\right) = -\frac{(4x - 3)^2}{4} + \frac{(4x - 3)^2}{2} + 4x^2 = \frac{(4x - 3)^2}{4} + 4x^2. \]

"To determine the area of the green square in the given tangram, we start by analyzing the given information and the structure of the tangram. The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a square with an area of 16 square inches. Therefore, the side length of the square is:
\[
\sqrt{16} = 4 \text{ inches}
\]

The tangram consists of seven pieces: one large square, one medium square, two large right triangles, one small right triangle, and four small squares. The large square is the same as the square \(ABCD\), so its area is 16 square inches. The medium square is one of the smaller pieces, and the two large right triangles are also part of the tangram. The small right triangle and the four small squares are the remaining pieces.

We are given that the piece ""e"" is a square and that the tangram is composed of three isosceles right triangles. The three isosceles right triangles are the two large right triangles and the small right triangle. Since the tangram is composed of three isosceles right triangles, the area of the medium square must be equal to the area of the four small squares combined.

Let's denote the side length of the medium square as \(s\). The area of the medium square is:
\[

The area of the four small squares is:
\[

Let's start with the first step:

1. Simplify the given equation:

"To determine who will win the team in the eight-hour race, we need to calculate the total distance each team member will cover in that time. The distance covered is the product of the speed and the time. Since the time is the same for all three members, the team member with the highest speed will win the race.

Here are the speeds of each team member:
- Navin: 160 rupi per hour
- Luka: 25 kuna per hour
- Ian: 34 pula per hour

To compare these speeds, we need to convert them to the same unit. Let's convert all speeds to Mauritius rupi per hour:
- Luka's speed in Mauritius rupi: \(25 \text{ kuna} \times \frac{32.35 \text{ Mauritius rupi}}{5.18 \text{ kuna}} = 25 \times 6.25 = 156.25 \text{ Mauritius rupi per hour}\)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the smaller semicircle that is tangent to the larger semicircle and the two smaller segments \(AQ\) and \(BQ\), which are perpendicular to each other and equal to the radius of the larger semicircle.

Given:
- The radius of the larger semicircle is \(R = 14\) inches.
- The two smaller segments \(AQ\) and \(BQ\) are equal to the radius of the larger semicircle, so \(AQ = BQ = 14\) inches.

The smaller semicircle is tangent to the larger semicircle and the two smaller segments \(AQ\) and \(BQ\). The diameter of the smaller semicircle is the distance between the points where the two smaller segments \(AQ\) and \(BQ\) meet the larger semicircle, which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length \(R\) and \(R\).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 1 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 1 \), we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). Then, we have:
\[ 1 + z = 1 + e^{i\theta} = 1 + \cos\theta + i\sin\theta, \]
and
\[ 1 - z + z^2 = 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{2i\theta} = 1 - \cos\theta + i\sin\theta + \cos2\theta + i\sin2\theta. \]

Next, we calculate the magnitudes of these complex numbers. The magnitude of \( 1 + z \) is:
\[ |1 + z| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{1 + 2\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos\theta} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos\theta)} = \sqrt{4\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = 2\left|\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right|. \]

The magnitude of \( 1 - z + z^2 \) is:
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta + \sin2\theta)^2}. \]
Using the double-angle identities \( \cos2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \) and \( \sin2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \), we get:
\[ 1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta = 1 - \cos\theta + 2\cos^2\theta - 1 = 2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta, \]
and
\[ \sin\theta + \sin2\theta = \sin\theta + 2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \sin\theta(1 + 2\cos\theta). \]
Thus,
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{(2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta(1 + 2\cos\theta))^2} = \sqrt{4\cos^4\theta - 4\cos^3\theta + \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta(1 + 2\cos\theta)^2} = \sqrt{4\cos^4\theta - 4\cos^3\theta + \cos^2\theta + (1 - \cos^2\theta)(1 + 4\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta)} = \sqrt{4\cos^4\theta - 4\cos^3\theta + \cos^2\theta + 1 + 4\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta - \cos^2\theta - 4\cos^3\theta - 4\cos^4\theta} = \sqrt{5\cos^2\theta - 8\cos^3\theta + 5\cos^2\theta + 4\cos\theta + 1} = \sqrt{5 - 8\cos^3\theta + 5\cos^2\theta + 4\cos\theta}. \]

To find the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \), we can test some specific values of \( \theta \). Let's try \( \theta = 0 \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 + 1| = 2, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 - 1 + 1| = 1, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 2 + 1 = 3. \]

Now, let's try \( \theta = \pi \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 - 1| = 0, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 0 + 3 = 3. \]

Finally, let's try \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \):
\[ |1 + z| = |1 + i| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}, \]
\[ |1 - z + z^2| = |1 - i - 1| = |-i| = 1, \]
\[ |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{2} + 1. \]

Since \( \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.414 \) is less than 3, the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) is indeed 3. Therefore, the maximum value is:

"To solve the problem, we need to perform a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the complex number \(-4 - 5i\) and then add 3 to the result. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Perform the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation
A 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of a complex number \(a + bi\) is equivalent to multiplying the complex number by \(i\). This is because multiplying by \(i\) corresponds to a rotation by 90 degrees in the complex plane.

Given the complex number \(-4 - 5i\), we multiply it by \(i\):
\[
(-4 - 5i) \cdot i = -4i - 5i^2

Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have:
\[
-4i - 5(-1) = -4i + 5 = 5 - 4i

So, the complex number after a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation is \(5 - 4i\).

### Step 2: Add 3 to the result

(5 - 4i) + 3 = 8 - 4i

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We now compare the digits in both representations:

- Base 7 digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8 digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). Counting the occurrences of each common digit, we have:
- The digit \(1\) appears once in both representations.
- The digit \(5\) appears twice in both representations.
- The digit \(6\) appears once in the base 7 representation and once in the base 8 representation.

Thus, the total number of common digits is:

"To determine how many cuts Roslyn has made, we need to analyze the information given about the kales and their types. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of cuts**: Roslyn has made a total of 5 cuts.

   - There are 4 cuts where the kale is not eaten (dawned kales).
   - There are 2 cuts where the kale is eaten (eaten kales).
   - There are 2 cuts where the kale is not eaten and the person is not eaten (dawned kales).
   - There are 2 cuts where the kale is eaten and the person is not eaten (eaten kales).

From the information above, we can see that the cuts can be categorized as follows:
- Total cuts where the kale is not eaten: 4 (dawned kales) + 2 (dawned kales) = 6
- Total cuts where the kale is eaten: 2 (eaten kales) + 2 (eaten kales) = 4

However, since Roslyn only made 5 cuts in total, the correct interpretation is that there are 4 cuts where the kale is not eaten and 1 cut where the kale is eaten. This is because the 2 cuts where the kale is eaten and the person is not eaten are counted twice in the initial interpretation.

Therefore, the correct number of cuts where the kale is not eaten is 4, and the correct number of cuts where the kale is eaten is 1.

The number of cuts where the kale is not eaten is 4, and the number of cuts where the kale is eaten is 1. The number of cuts where the kale is not eaten and the person is not eaten is 4, and the number of cuts where the kale is eaten and the person is not eaten is 2.

The total number of cuts where the kale is not eaten is 4, and the total number of cuts where the kale is eaten is 1.

"To determine the number of ways to assign 5 different offices to 3 people such that each person gets at least one office, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to assign 5 different offices to 3 people without any restrictions. Each of the 5 offices can be assigned to any of the 3 people, so the total number of assignments is:
\[ 3^5 = 243. \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of assignments in which at least one person does not get an office. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

1. Subtract the number of ways in which at least one person does not get an office. There are \(\binom{3}{1} = 3\) ways to choose which one person does not get an office, and for each of these choices, there are \(2^5 = 32\) ways to assign the offices to the remaining two people. So, we subtract:
\[ 3 \cdot 32 = 96. \]

\[ 3 \cdot 1 = 3. \]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of ways to assign 5 different offices to 3 people such that each person gets at least one office is:

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[ bq = 12 \times 167 = 2004 \]

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from 2004:

"To determine the effect of the reflection on the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), we first need to find the matrix representation of the reflection. The reflection matrix across a vector \(\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2a^2 - b^2 & 2ab \\ 2ab & 2b^2 - a^2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Given that the reflection matrix transforms the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) into \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), we can write:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2a^2 - b^2 & 2ab \\ 2ab & 2b^2 - a^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 10a^2 - 5b^2 \\ 10ab \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

From this, we get the system of equations:

\[
10a^2 - 5b^2 = 4 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
10ab = 3 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, solve equation (2) for \(b\):

\[
b = \frac{3}{10a}
\]

Substitute this into equation (1):

\[
10a^2 - 5\left(\frac{3}{10a}\right)^2 = 4
\]
\[
10a^2 - 5 \cdot \frac{9}{100a^2} = 4
\]
\[
10a^2 - \frac{45}{100a^2} = 4
\]
\[
10a^2 - \frac{9}{20a^2} = 4
\]

Multiply through by \(20a^2\) to clear the fraction:

\[
200a^4 - 9 = 80a^2
\]
\[
200a^4 - 80a^2 - 9 = 0
\]

Let \(x = a^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in \(x\):

\[
200x^2 - 80x - 9 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 200\), \(b = -80\), and \(c = -9\):

\[
x = \frac{80 \pm \sqrt{(-80)^2 - 4 \cdot 200 \cdot (-9)}}{2 \cdot 200}
\]
\[
x = \frac{80 \pm \sqrt{6400 + 7200}}{400}
\]
\[
x = \frac{80 \pm \sqrt{13600}}{400}
\]
\[
x = \frac{80 \pm 40\sqrt{34}}{400}
\]
\[
x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{34}}{10}
\]

Since \(x = a^2\) must be positive, we take the positive root:

\[
x = \frac{2 + \sqrt{34}}{10}
\]
\[
a^2 = \frac{2 + \sqrt{34}}{10}
\]

Now, substitute \(a^2\) back into the expression for \(b\):

\[
b = \frac{3}{10a} = \frac{3}{10\sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{34}}{10}}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10(2 + \sqrt{34})}} = \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{20 + 10\sqrt{34}}}
\]

However, we don't need the exact values of \(a\) and \(b\) to find the effect of the reflection on the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\). We can use the fact that the reflection matrix is symmetric and its form is known. The reflection matrix is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{2a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} \\ \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2b^2 - a^2}{a^2 + b^2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

We can use the property that the reflection of a vector \(\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{2a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} \\ \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2b^2 - a^2}{a^2 + b^2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}
\]

For the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), the reflection is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{2a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} \\ \frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} & \frac{2b^2 - a^2}{a^2 + b^2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}

"To find the equation of the hyperbola and the distance between its asymptotes, we start by noting that the asymptotes of a hyperbola are given by the equations \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 17 - 2x\). The equations of the asymptotes can be rewritten in the form \(y - k = m(x - h)\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the hyperbola and \(m\) is the slope of the asymptotes. From the given asymptotes, we can see that the center \((h, k)\) is the intersection of the lines \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 17 - 2x\).

To find the center, we solve the system of equations:
\[
y = 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 17 - 2x
\]
Setting the right-hand sides equal to each other, we get:
\[
2x - 3 = 17 - 2x
\]
Adding \(2x\) to both sides, we get:
\[
4x - 3 = 17
\]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[
4x = 20
\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 5
\]
Substituting \(x = 5\) back into the equation \(y = 2x - 3\), we get:
\[
y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
\]
Thus, the center of the hyperbola is \((5, 7)\).

The slopes of the asymptotes are both 2, which means the hyperbola is of the form \(\frac{(y - 7)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - 5)^2}{b^2} = 1\) or \(\frac{(x - 5)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{a^2} = 1\). Since the slopes of the asymptotes are \(\pm \frac{a}{b}\) or \(\pm \frac{b}{a}\), and both are 2, we have \(a = b\). Therefore, the hyperbola is of the form \(\frac{(y - 7)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - 5)^2}{a^2} = 1\).

The equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(y - 7)^2 - (x - 5)^2}{a^2} = 1
\]
or
\[
(y - 7)^2 - (x - 5)^2 = a^2
\]
Since the hyperbola passes through the point \((4, 7)\), we substitute \(x = 4\) and \(y = 7\) into the equation:
\[
(7 - 7)^2 - (4 - 5)^2 = a^2
\]
\[
0 - (-1)^2 = a^2
\]
\[
-1 = a^2
\]
\[
a^2 = 1
\]
Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
(y - 7)^2 - (x - 5)^2 = 1
\]

The asymptotes of this hyperbola are \(y - 7 = \pm 2(x - 5)\), which are \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 17 - 2x\). The distance between the asymptotes is the distance between the lines \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 2x + 9\). The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(Ax + By + C_1 = 0\) and \(Ax + By + C_2 = 0\) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|C_2 - C_1|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
For the lines \(y = 2x - 3\) and \(y = 2x + 9\), we can rewrite them as \(2x - y - 3 = 0\) and \(2x - y + 9 = 0\). Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), \(C_1 = -3\), and \(C_2 = 9\). Therefore, the distance is:
\[
d = \frac{|9 - (-3)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|9 + 3|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{12\sqrt{5}}{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( N \) such that the number \( 21420N \) has a units digit of 0 and is divisible by 6. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the units digit of \( 21420N \)
The number \( 21420 \) ends in 0. When we multiply any number by 0, the result also ends in 0. Therefore, the units digit of \( 21420N \) is 0, which satisfies the condition that \( 21420N \) has a units digit of 0.

### Step 2: Determine the divisibility of \( 21420N \) by 6
A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since \( 21420N \) ends in 0, it is divisible by 2. Now, we need to check its divisibility by 3.

### Step 3: Check the divisibility of \( 21420N \) by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \( 21420 \) is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9 \]
Since 9 is divisible by 3, the number \( 21420 \) is divisible by 3. Therefore, the number \( 21420N \) is divisible by 3 for any digit \( N \).

### Step 4: Conclusion
Since \( 21420N \) is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6 for any digit \( N \). However, the problem asks for the value of \( N \) that is not zero. The possible values for \( N \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Any of these values will satisfy the condition.

"To determine the number of tokalaşmalar that occurred at the ball, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

2. Each candidate has a favorite candidate, and they will not tokalaşmaya karar verdik if their favorite candidate is not their own.
3. No candidate will tokalaşmaya karar verdik if they have another candidate who is not their favorite.

From the information above, we can deduce that each candidate will tokalaşmaya karar verdik if and only if their favorite candidate is not their own and no other candidate is their favorite. This means that each candidate will tokalaşmaya karar verdik if their favorite candidate is one of the other 5 candidates, and no other candidate is their favorite.

"Given the polynomial \( P(x) \) of degree 2, we can express it in the form \( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). We know that the polynomial satisfies the inequality \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \) for all real numbers \( x \), and that \( P(11) = 181 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( Q(x) = P(x) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) \). Since \( P(x) \ge x^2 - 2x + 2 \), it follows that \( Q(x) \ge 0 \) for all \( x \). Similarly, let's consider the polynomial \( R(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - P(x) \). Since \( P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \), it follows that \( R(x) \ge 0 \) for all \( x \).

Since \( Q(x) \) and \( R(x) \) are both non-negative polynomials of degree 2, they must be perfect squares. Therefore, we can write:
\[ Q(x) = k(x - r)^2 \]
\[ R(x) = m(x - s)^2 \]
for some constants \( k, m, r, \) and \( s \).

Expanding these, we get:
\[ Q(x) = kx^2 - 2krx + kr \]
\[ R(x) = mx^2 - 2msx + ms \]

From the definitions of \( Q(x) \) and \( R(x) \), we have:
\[ Q(x) = P(x) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) = ax^2 + bx + c - x^2 + 2x - 2 = (a-1)x^2 + (b+2)x + (c-2) \]
\[ R(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - P(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 - ax^2 - bx - c = (2-a)x^2 + (-b-4)x + (3-c) \]

By comparing coefficients, we get:
\[ a-1 = k, \quad b+2 = -2kr, \quad c-2 = kr \]
\[ 2-a = m, \quad -b-4 = -2ms, \quad 3-c = ms \]

From \( a-1 = k \) and \( 2-a = m \), we get:
\[ m = 2 - (a-1) = 3 - a \]

From \( c-2 = kr \) and \( 3-c = ms \), we get:
\[ c-2 = (a-1)r \]
\[ 3-c = (3-a)s \]

Adding these two equations, we get:
\[ 1 = (a-1)r + (3-a)s \]

From \( b+2 = -2kr \) and \( -b-4 = -2ms \), we get:
\[ -b-4 = -2(a-1)s \]
\[ b+4 = 2(a-1)s \]

From \( c-2 = (a-1)r \) and \( 3-c = (3-a)s \), we get:
\[ c-2 = (a-1)r \]
\[ 3-c = (3-a)s \]

We also know that \( P(11) = 181 \):
\[ P(11) = a(11)^2 + b(11) + c = 121a + 11b + c = 181 \]

We now have a system of equations:
1. \( m = 3 - a \)
2. \( 1 = (a-1)r + (3-a)s \)
3. \( b+4 = 2(a-1)s \)
4. \( c-2 = (a-1)r \)
5. \( 121a + 11b + c = 181 \)

From \( c-2 = (a-1)r \), we get:
\[ c = (a-1)r + 2 \]

Substitute \( c \) into the fifth equation:
\[ 121a + 11b + (a-1)r + 2 = 181 \]
\[ 121a + 11b + (a-1)r = 179 \]

From \( b+4 = 2(a-1)s \), we get:
\[ b = 2(a-1)s - 4 \]

Substitute \( b \) into the equation:
\[ 121a + 11(2(a-1)s - 4) + (a-1)r = 179 \]
\[ 121a + 22(a-1)s - 44 + (a-1)r = 179 \]
\[ 121a + 22(a-1)s + (a-1)r = 223 \]

We also have:
\[ 1 = (a-1)r + (3-a)s \]

We can solve these equations to find \( a \), \( r \), and \( s \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( P(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial and the given conditions. By symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can assume \( P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 \). This polynomial satisfies all the given conditions:
\[ P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 \]
\[ P(11) = 11^2 + 2(11) + 1 = 121 + 22 + 1 = 144 \]

However, we need to correct this assumption. The correct polynomial is:
\[ P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 \]

Thus, the correct value of \( P(16) \) is:
\[ P(16) = 16^2 + 2(16) + 1 = 256 + 32 + 1 = 289 \]

Therefore, the value of \( P(16) \) is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\), we will follow these steps:

   The expression can be rewritten as:

   \]

2. **Multiply the coefficients in the numerator:**
   \[
   10 \cdot 4 = 40
   \]
   So the expression now is:
   \[
   \frac{40 \cdot r^3 \cdot r^6}{8 \cdot r^4}
   \]

3. **Multiply the variables in the numerator:**
   Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we get:
   \[
   r^3 \cdot r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9

   So the expression now is:

"To solve the equation \((3)5^2-4(5-a)^2 \div 3=63\) and find the sum of the values of \(a\) that satisfy it, we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Solve the resulting equation for \(a\).
3. Find the sum of the solutions for \(a\).

Let's start with the equation:
\[
(3)5^2 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

First, calculate \(5^2\):
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
3 \cdot 25 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]
Simplify \(3 \cdot 25\):
\[
3 \cdot 25 = 75
\]
So the equation is now:
\[
75 - 4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63
\]

Next, isolate the term involving \(a\). Subtract 75 from both sides:
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 63 - 75
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
63 - 75 = -12
\]
So the equation is:
\[
-4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = -12
\]

To eliminate the negative sign, multiply both sides by -1:
\[
4(5-a)^2 \div 3 = 12
\]

Next, eliminate the division by 3 by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
4(5-a)^2 = 36
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[
(5-a)^2 = 9
\]

To solve for \(5-a\), take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:
\[
5-a = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 5-a = -3
\]

Solve each equation for \(a\):
\[
5-a = 3 \implies a = 5-3 = 2
\]
\[
5-a = -3 \implies a = 5+3 = 8
\]

The solutions for \(a\) are \(a = 2\) and \(a = 8\). To find the sum of the solutions, add them together:
\[

"To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we first reduce the bases modulo 11.

First, we find the remainder when 129 is divided by 11:
\[129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[129 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Next, we find the remainder when 96 is divided by 11:
\[96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8,\]
so
\[96 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, we substitute these congruences into the original expression:
\[129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 8^{34} + 8^{38} \pmod{11}.\]

We can factor out \(8^{34}\) from the expression:
\[8^{34} + 8^{38} = 8^{34}(1 + 8^4).\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(8^4\) is divided by 11. We calculate:
\[8^2 = 64 \equiv 9 \pmod{11},\]
\[8^4 = (8^2)^2 \equiv 9^2 = 81 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

So, we have:
\[1 + 8^4 \equiv 1 + 4 = 5 \pmod{11}.\]

Now, the expression simplifies to:
\[8^{34}(1 + 8^4) \equiv 8^{34} \cdot 5 \pmod{11}.\]

To find \(8^{34} \pmod{11}\), we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\) for a prime \(p\) and an integer \(a\) not divisible by \(p\). Here, \(a = 8\) and \(p = 11\), so:
\[8^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}.\]

We can write \(8^{34}\) as:
\[8^{34} = 8^{3 \cdot 10 + 4} = (8^{10})^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 8^4 \equiv 8^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}.\]

Therefore, we have:
\[8^{34} \cdot 5 \equiv 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}.\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the third equation for \(y\):

\[

Next, substitute \(y = 2x + 30\) into the first equation:

\[
2z + 5(2x + 30) = 90 \implies 2z + 10x + 150 = 90 \implies 2z + 10x = -60 \implies z + 5x = -30 \implies z = -5x - 30.
\]

Now substitute \(y = 2x + 30\) and \(z = -5x - 30\) into the second equation:

\[
-5x - (-5x - 30) = 30 \implies -5x + 5x + 30 = 30 \implies 30 = 30.

This equation is true for all \(x\), so it does not provide any new information. Therefore, the general solution to the system is:

To find the vector with the smallest magnitude, we minimize the expression:

"To find the vector \(\mathbf{a}\) that is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and satisfies \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 8\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the condition for perpendicularity**: Two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. Therefore, if \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\), then \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2a_1 + 6a_2 + 3a_3 = 0\).

2. **Use the given dot product condition**: We are given that \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 8\). This gives us the equation \(2a_1 + 6a_2 + 3a_3 = 8\).

3. **Express one variable in terms of the others**: We can solve the equation \(2a_1 + 6a_2 + 3a_3 = 8\) for one of the variables. Let's solve for \(a_1\):
   \[
   a_1 = 4 - 3a_2 - \frac{3a_3}{2}
   \]

4. **Choose values for \(a_2\) and \(a_3\)**: To find a specific solution, we can choose any values for \(a_2\) and \(a_3\). Let's choose \(a_2 = 0\) and \(a_3 = 0\):
   \[
   a_1 = 4 - 3(0) - \frac{3(0)}{2} = 4
   \]

5. **Write the vector \(\mathbf{a}\)**: With \(a_1 = 4\), \(a_2 = 0\), and \(a_3 = 0\), the vector \(\mathbf{a}\) is:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

6. **Verify the solution**: Check that \(\mathbf{a}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\) and that their dot product is 8:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 4(2) + 0(6) + 0(3) = 8
   \]
   The dot product is indeed 8, and \(\mathbf{a}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\) because \(2(4) + 6(0) + 3(0) = 8 \neq 0\). Therefore, we need to choose different values for \(a_2\) and \(a_3\).

Let's choose \(a_2 = 0\) and \(a_3 = 2\):
   \[
   a_1 = 4 - 3(0) - \frac{3(2)}{2} = 4 - 3 = 1
   \]

7. **Write the vector \(\mathbf{a}\)**: With \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 0\), and \(a_3 = 2\), the vector \(\mathbf{a}\) is:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

8. **Verify the solution**: Check that \(\mathbf{a}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\) and that their dot product is 8:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 1(2) + 0(6) + 2(3) = 2 + 6 = 8
   \]
   The dot product is indeed 8, and \(\mathbf{a}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\) because \(2(1) + 6(0) + 3(2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \neq 0\).

"To solve the equation \(\arccos x + \arccos 2x + \arccos 3x = \pi\), we start by letting \(\theta = \arccos x\), \(\phi = \arccos 2x\), and \(\psi = \arccos 3x\). This gives us the equation \(\theta + \phi + \psi = \pi\), which implies \(\psi = \pi - \theta - \phi\). Taking the cosine of both sides, we get:

\[
\cos \psi = \cos (\pi - \theta - \phi) = -\cos (\theta + \phi).
\]

Since \(\psi = \arccos 3x\), we have \(\cos \psi = 3x\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
3x = -\cos (\theta + \phi).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, \(\cos (\theta + \phi) = \cos \theta \cos \phi - \sin \theta \sin \phi\), we substitute \(\cos \theta = x\), \(\cos \phi = 2x\), \(\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\), and \(\sin \phi = \sqrt{1 - (2x)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}\). This gives:

\[
3x = -\left(x \cdot 2x - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 4x^2}\right) = -\left(2x^2 - \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}\right).
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
3x = -2x^2 + \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Adding \(2x^2\) to both sides, we obtain:

\[
2x^2 + 3x = \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2)}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(2x^2 + 3x)^2 = (1 - x^2)(1 - 4x^2).
\]

Expanding both sides, we have:

\[
4x^4 + 12x^3 + 9x^2 = 1 - 5x^2 + 4x^4.
\]

Subtracting \(4x^4\) from both sides, we get:

\[
12x^3 + 9x^2 = 1 - 5x^2.
\]

Adding \(5x^2\) to both sides, we obtain:

\[
12x^3 + 14x^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

Thus, the polynomial equation is:

\[
12x^3 + 14x^2 - 1 = 0.

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, the sums and products of the roots are:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]
Next, we use the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\). We can express \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\) as \(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\) as \(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_4}\), and \(\alpha_2\alpha_4\) as \(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_3}\).

S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_3},

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2},
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3}.
\]
To find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\), we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that the roots are complex. By symmetry and the properties of the roots of the polynomial, we can deduce that the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 2t^2 + 2 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are:

"To find the largest number less than 2010 that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7, a remainder of 10 when divided by 11, and a remainder of 10 when divided by 13, we can set up the following system of congruences:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}
\end{cases}
\]

Since \(x \equiv 10 \pmod{11}\) and \(x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}\), it follows that \(x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}\) (because 11 and 13 are coprime, their least common multiple is \(11 \times 13 = 143\)). Therefore, we can rewrite the system as:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{143}
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find a number \(x\) that satisfies both congruences. Let \(x = 143k + 10\) for some integer \(k\). Substituting this into the first congruence, we get:

\[
143k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(143 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}\) (because \(143 = 20 \times 7 + 3\)), the congruence simplifies to:

\[
3k + 10 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

\[
3k \equiv -5 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(-5 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), the congruence becomes:

\[
3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]

To solve for \(k\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7. The inverse of 3 modulo 7 is a number \(y\) such that:

\[
3y \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

We can find this inverse by testing values. If \(y = 5\), then:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5. Multiplying both sides of the congruence \(3k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) by 5, we get:

\[
k \equiv 10 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \(10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}\), we have:

\[
k \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, \(k = 7m + 3\) for some integer \(m\). Substituting this back into the expression for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 143(7m + 3) + 10 = 1001m + 429 + 10 = 1001m + 439
\]

The largest \(x\) less than 2010 occurs when \(m = 1\):

\[
x = 1001 \times 1 + 439 = 1440

Thus, the largest number less than 2010 that satisfies all the given conditions is:

"To solve for \( x \) when \( y = 3 \), given that \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{x} \) and \( y = 15 \) when \( x = 24 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express the inverse proportionality relationship:**
   Since \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{x} \), we can write:
   \[
   y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}}
   \]
   where \( k \) is a constant.

2. **Determine the value of \( k \):**
   We know that when \( x = 24 \), \( y = 15 \). Substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
   \[
   15 = \frac{k}{\sqrt{24}}
   \]
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{24} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   15 = \frac{k}{2\sqrt{6}}

   To solve for \( k \), multiply both sides by \( 2\sqrt{6} \):
   \[
   k = 15 \times 2\sqrt{6} = 30\sqrt{6}
   \]

3. **Use the value of \( k \) to find \( x \) when \( y = 3 \):**
   Substitute \( y = 3 \) and \( k = 30\sqrt{6} \) into the equation \( y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}} \):
   \[
   3 = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{x}}

"To find the value of \(AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2\) where \(F\) is the centroid of the triangle \(ABC\) and \(G\) and \(H\) are the centroid and the circumcenter of the triangle \(ABC\) respectively, we can use the properties of the centroid and the circumcenter of a triangle.

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides the median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The circumcenter \(H\) is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle.

The formula for the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the vertices of the triangle \(ABC\) is given by:
\[
AG^2 + BG^2 + CG^2 = \frac{1}{3}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)

where \(R\) is the circumradius of the triangle.

The formula for the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the circumcenter \(H\) is given by:
\[
GH^2 = \frac{1}{9}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 3R^2

Now, we need to find \(AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2\). Since \(F\) is the midpoint of \(GH\), we have:
\[
AF^2 = AG^2 + GF^2 = AG^2 + \left(\frac{GH}{2}\right)^2 = AG^2 + \frac{GH^2}{4}

\[
BF^2 = BG^2 + GF^2 = BG^2 + \left(\frac{GH}{2}\right)^2 = BG^2 + \frac{GH^2}{4}

\[
CF^2 = CG^2 + GF^2 = CG^2 + \left(\frac{GH}{2}\right)^2 = CG^2 + \frac{GH^2}{4}

Adding these three equations, we get:
\[
AF^2 + BF^2 + CF^2 = \left(AG^2 + BG^2 + CG^2\right) + 3\left(\frac{GH^2}{4}\right) = \left(AG^2 + BG^2 + CG^2\right) + \frac{3}{4}GH^2

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the diagonal of an equilateral triangle given its area, and then use the fact that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is equal to the perimeter of a square to find the side length of the square, and finally, use the side length of the square to find the length of its diagonal.

First, let's find the side length of the equilateral triangle. The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by the formula:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
We are given that the area is \(16\sqrt{3}\) square units. So, we can write:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 16\sqrt{3}
\]
To solve for \(s^2\), we divide both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{1}{4} s^2 = 16
\]
Next, we multiply both sides by 4:
\[
s^2 = 64
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 8
\]
So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 8 units.

Next, we find the length of the diagonal of the equilateral triangle. The diagonal \(d\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by the formula:
\[
d = s\sqrt{3}
\]
Substituting \(s = 8\), we get:
\[
d = 8\sqrt{3}

So, the length of the diagonal of the equilateral triangle is \(8\sqrt{3}\) units.

Now, we know that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is equal to the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is:
\[
3s = 3 \times 8 = 24

Let the side length of the square be \(a\). The perimeter of the square is:

Setting the perimeters equal, we get:

4a = 24

Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[
a = 6

So, the side length of the square is 6 units.

Finally, we find the length of the diagonal of the square. The diagonal \(d\) of a square with side length \(a\) is given by the formula:
\[
d = a\sqrt{2}

Substituting \(a = 6\), we get:
\[
d = 6\sqrt{2}

"To determine the cost of one gemstone, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one kalem as \( x \) dollars and the cost of one jumbo sili as \( y \) dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Three kalem and one jumbo sili cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3x + y = 1.24
   \]
2. Five kalem and one jumbo sili cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5x + y = 1.82

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2x = 0.58
\]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 0.29
\]

Now that we know the cost of one kalem is \$0.29, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the cost of one jumbo sili:
\[
3(0.29) + y = 1.24

\]
Solving for \( y \), we subtract 0.87 from both sides:
\[

The cost of one jumbo sili is \$0.37. Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given that \(a + b + c + d = 1\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-HM (Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean) inequality in a strategic way. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, define the function \(f(a, b, c, d) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) and the constraint \(g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 1 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to solve the system of equations given by \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\) and \(g(a, b, c, d) = 0\).

First, compute the gradients:
\[
\nabla f = \left( -\frac{1}{a^2}, -\frac{1}{b^2}, -\frac{4}{c^2}, -\frac{16}{d^2} \right)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (1, 1, 1, 1)
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get:
\[
-\frac{1}{a^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{1}{b^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{4}{c^2} = \lambda, \quad -\frac{16}{d^2} = \lambda
\]

From these equations, we can express \(\lambda\) in terms of \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\):
\[
\lambda = -\frac{1}{a^2} = -\frac{1}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{c^2} = -\frac{16}{d^2}
\]

This gives us the following relationships:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{1}{b^2} \implies a = b
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{4}{c^2} \implies c = 2a
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{16}{d^2} \implies d = 4a
\]

Substitute \(b = a\), \(c = 2a\), and \(d = 4a\) into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):
\[
a + a + 2a + 4a = 1 \implies 8a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Then, \(b = \frac{1}{8}\), \(c = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(d = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2}\).

Now, substitute these values back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} + \frac{4}{\frac{1}{4}} + \frac{16}{\frac{1}{2}} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64

\[a^4 + b^8 = \left(\frac{5}{b^2}\right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.\]

Let \(x = b^8\). Then the expression becomes:

\[\frac{625}{x} + x.\]

To find the minimum value of this function, we take the derivative with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{625}{x} + x\right) = -\frac{625}{x^2} + 1.\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[-\frac{625}{x^2} + 1 = 0 \implies \frac{625}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 625 \implies x = 25.\]

Since \(x = b^8\) and \(b\) is a positive real number, we have \(x = 25\). Therefore, \(b^8 = 25\), and taking the eighth root of both sides, we get:

\[b = 25^{1/8}.\]

Now, we substitute \(b = 25^{1/8}\) back into the expression for \(a\):

\[a = \frac{5}{b^2} = \frac{5}{(25^{1/8})^2} = \frac{5}{25^{1/4}} = \frac{5}{5^{1/2}} = 5^{1/2} = \sqrt{5}.\]

Finally, we substitute \(a = \sqrt{5}\) and \(b = 25^{1/8}\) into the original expression \(a^4 + b^8\):

\[a^4 + b^8 = (\sqrt{5})^4 + 25 = 25 + 25 = 50.\]

Thus, the minimum value of \(a^4 + b^8\) is \(\boxed{50}\).","[50, '50']",50,"[50, '50']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{9}{2}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 9 by 2. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(9 \div 2\).

3. Subtract 8 from 9 to get a remainder of 1.

5. Now, divide 10 by 2, which goes exactly 5 times (because \(2 \times 5 = 10\)).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given recurrence relation:
\[ f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) \]
and the initial condition:
\[ f(1) = f(1986). \]

First, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns. We know:
\[ f(1) = f(1986). \]

Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( f(2) \):
\[ f(2) = (-1)^2 \cdot 1 - 2f(1) = 1 - 2f(1). \]

Next, we find \( f(3) \):
\[ f(3) = (-1)^3 \cdot 2 - 2f(2) = -2 - 2(1 - 2f(1)) = -2 - 2 + 4f(1) = -4 + 4f(1). \]

Next, we find \( f(4) \):
\[ f(4) = (-1)^4 \cdot 3 - 2f(3) = 3 - 2(-4 + 4f(1)) = 3 + 8 - 8f(1) = 11 - 8f(1). \]

Next, we find \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) = (-1)^5 \cdot 4 - 2f(4) = -4 - 2(11 - 8f(1)) = -4 - 22 + 16f(1) = -26 + 16f(1). \]

We observe that the terms of the sequence can be written in the form:
\[ f(n) = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(n-1)(-1)^{n-1}}{2} + (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(n-1)(-1)^{n-1}}{2} f(1). \]

To find the sum \( f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \), we use the fact that the sequence is periodic with a period of 4. The sum of one period is:
\[ f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) = f(1) + (1 - 2f(1)) + (-4 + 4f(1)) + (11 - 8f(1)) = 8 - 5f(1). \]

Since \( f(1) = f(1986) \), the sum of the first 1985 terms is:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{57}{160}\) into a finite decimal, we can perform long division of 57 by 160. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(57 \div 160\).
2. Since 160 is greater than 57, the integer part of the quotient is 0. So, we write 0. and then a decimal point.
3. Now, we need to divide 57 by 160, which is the same as dividing 57.000000... by 160.
4. 160 goes into 570 three times (since \(160 \times 3 = 480\)). So, we write 3 after the decimal point.
5. Subtract 480 from 570 to get a remainder of 90.
6. Bring down the next 0 to make it 900. Now, we need to divide 900 by 160.
7. 160 goes into 900 five times (since \(160 \times 5 = 800\)). So, we write 5 after the 3.
8. Subtract 800 from 900 to get a remainder of 100.
9. Bring down the next 0 to make it 1000. Now, we need to divide 1000 by 160.
10. 160 goes into 1000 six times (since \(160 \times 6 = 960\)). So, we write 6 after the 5.

"To find the area of the isosceles right triangle, we start by letting the legs of the triangle be \(a\). Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the hypotenuse \(c\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
c = a\sqrt{2}
\]
The area \(A\) of the triangle is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2}a^2
\]
The height from the right angle to the hypotenuse is given as \(4\sqrt{2}\). This height can also be expressed in terms of the area of the triangle. The area can also be written as:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{hypotenuse} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times a\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times a\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times 8 = 4a
\]
Since both expressions represent the area of the same triangle, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{1}{2}a^2 = 4a
\]
To solve for \(a\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
a^2 = 8a

Next, we rearrange the equation:
\[
a^2 - 8a = 0

We factor out \(a\):
\[
a(a - 8) = 0

This gives us two solutions: \(a = 0\) (which is not possible for a side length) and \(a = 8\). Therefore, the length of each leg of the triangle is 8. The area of the triangle is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is positive because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the square root of zero would make the denominator zero, which is also undefined.

The expression inside the square root is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \). We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3). \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ (x-2)(x-3) > 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \), which are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:
- For \( x \in (-\infty, 2) \), choose \( x = 1 \). Then \( (1-2)(1-3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (-\infty, 2) \).
- For \( x \in (2, 3) \), choose \( x = 2.5 \). Then \( (2.5-2)(2.5-3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0 \). So, the inequality does not hold in \( (2, 3) \).
- For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \). Then \( (4-2)(4-3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds in \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( (x-2)(x-3) > 0 \) is \( (-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of dice \( n \) such that the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number is \(\frac{25}{216}\).

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number. When rolling two dice, there are \(6 \times 6 = 36\) possible outcomes. The number of outcomes where the two dice show the same number is 6 (i.e., (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)). Therefore, the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number is:
\[
\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

However, the problem states that the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number is \(\frac{25}{216}\). This suggests that the problem is considering the probability of rolling \( n \) dice and getting the same number on any two of them. The number of ways to choose 2 dice out of \( n \) is \(\binom{n}{2}\), and for each pair of dice, there are 6 outcomes where they show the same number. The total number of outcomes when rolling \( n \) dice is \(6^n\). Therefore, the probability of rolling \( n \) dice and getting the same number on any two of them is:
\[
\frac{\binom{n}{2} \cdot 6}{6^n} = \frac{\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot 6}{6^n} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2 \cdot 6^{n-1}}

"To determine the value of \(\square\), we start by analyzing the given equations:

1. \(\triangle + \square = \clubsuit\)
2. \(\triangle + \triangle = \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond + \diamond\)
3. \(\triangle + \triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond\)

First, let's simplify the second and third equations. The second equation can be rewritten as:
\[2\triangle = 5\diamond\]
This tells us that \(2\triangle\) is equal to \(5\diamond\).

The third equation can be rewritten as:
\[2\triangle = \clubsuit + \diamond\]
Since we already know from the second equation that \(2\triangle = 5\diamond\), we can substitute \(5\diamond\) for \(2\triangle\) in the third equation:
\[5\diamond = \clubsuit + \diamond\]
To isolate \(\clubsuit\), we subtract \(\diamond\) from both sides:
\[4\diamond = \clubsuit\]
So, \(\clubsuit\) is equal to \(4\diamond\).

Now, we substitute \(\clubsuit = 4\diamond\) into the first equation:
\[\triangle + \square = 4\diamond\]
From the second equation, we know that \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2}\diamond\). We substitute this value for \(\triangle\) in the equation:
\[\frac{5}{2}\diamond + \square = 4\diamond\]
To isolate \(\square\), we subtract \(\frac{5}{2}\diamond\) from both sides:
\[\square = 4\diamond - \frac{5}{2}\diamond\]
To combine the terms on the right side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 4 and \(\frac{5}{2}\) is 2. So, we rewrite \(4\diamond\) as \(\frac{8}{2}\diamond\):
\[\square = \frac{8}{2}\diamond - \frac{5}{2}\diamond = \frac{3}{2}\diamond\]
Since \(\diamond\) is one of the digits from 1 to 9, and \(\square\) must also be a digit from 1 to 9, we need to determine which digit \(\diamond\) is. The value of \(\square\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\) of \(\diamond\), so \(\diamond\) must be an even digit to ensure that \(\square\) is an integer. The possible values for \(\diamond\) are 2, 4, 6, and 8. We check each value:

- If \(\diamond = 2\), then \(\square = \frac{3}{2} \times 2 = 3\).
- If \(\diamond = 4\), then \(\square = \frac{3}{2} \times 4 = 6\).
- If \(\diamond = 6\), then \(\square = \frac{3}{2} \times 6 = 9\).
- If \(\diamond = 8\), then \(\square = \frac{3}{2} \times 8 = 12\), which is not a digit from 1 to 9.

Therefore, the possible values for \(\square\) are 3, 6, and 9. However, we need to check which of these values is consistent with the other equations. If \(\diamond = 2\), then \(\triangle = \frac{5}{2} \times 2 = 5\) and \(\clubsuit = 4 \times 2 = 8\). Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 500 is greater than 137, the integer part of the quotient is 0. So, we write \(0.\) and proceed with the division by adding a decimal point and zeros to 137, making it 137.000000...
3. Now, we divide 1370 by 500, which gives 2 with a remainder of 370. So, we write 2 after the decimal point, making the quotient \(0.2\).
4. Next, we divide 3700 by 500, which gives 7 with a remainder of 200. So, we write 7 after the 2, making the quotient \(0.27\).

"To simplify the expression \((u+4)(u-1) - (u-3)(u+6)\), we will first expand each product separately and then combine like terms.

First, expand \((u+4)(u-1)\):

1. Calculate the total amount of gas used by the car in gallons.
2. Determine how much gas would have been used by the SUV if it had used the same amount of gas as the car.

First, we know that the car used 12,000 miles and had an average fuel efficiency of 48 miles per gallon. To find the total gallons of gas used by the car, we divide the total miles by the miles per gallon:

\[

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by \( d \). The second term \( x \) can be expressed as \( 9 + d \) and the third term \( 81 \) can be expressed as \( x + d = 9 + 2d \).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = a\) and \(AD = ka\), where \(k\) is a positive constant. The vertices of the rectangle are then \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{ka}{2})\), \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{ka}{2})\), \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{ka}{2})\), and \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{ka}{2})\).

The region where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(O\) with radii equal to the distances from \(O\) to each vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{ka}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + k^2a^2}}{2} = \frac{a\sqrt{1+k^2}}{2}\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(\frac{a\sqrt{1+k^2}}{2}\). This circle is entirely inside the rectangle because the diagonal of the rectangle is \(a\sqrt{1+k^2}\), which is the diameter of the circle.

"To find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points of tangency of the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) and the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\), we first need to determine the points of tangency.

The circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) has a center at \((0,0)\) and a radius of \(\sqrt{2}\). The parabola \(y^2 = 8x\) opens to the right. Let's consider the point of tangency on the parabola in the first quadrant, which we will denote as \((x_1, y_1)\). Since \(y_1^2 = 8x_1\), the point of tangency can be written as \((x_1, \sqrt{8x_1})\).

The slope of the tangent to the parabola at \((x_1, \sqrt{8x_1})\) is given by the derivative of \(y^2 = 8x\). Differentiating implicitly, we get:
\[2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 8 \implies \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4}{y}.\]
At the point \((x_1, \sqrt{8x_1})\), the slope of the tangent is:
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{8x_1}} = \frac{4}{2\sqrt{2x_1}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2x_1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}.\]

The equation of the tangent line at \((x_1, \sqrt{8x_1})\) is:
\[y - \sqrt{8x_1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}(x - x_1).\]
Since this tangent line is also tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\), the distance from the center of the circle \((0,0)\) to this tangent line is equal to the radius \(\sqrt{2}\). The distance from a point \((x_0, y_0)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:
\[\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.\]
Rewriting the tangent line equation in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\), we get:
\[y - \sqrt{8x_1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}(x - x_1) \implies \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x - y + \sqrt{8x_1} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x_1 = 0.\]
So, \(A = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = \sqrt{8x_1} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x_1\). The distance from \((0,0)\) to this line is:
\[\frac{\left| \sqrt{8x_1} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x_1 \right|}{\sqrt{\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}} \right)^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{\left| \sqrt{8x_1} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x_1 \right|}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{x_1} + 1}} = \sqrt{2}.\]
Simplifying the numerator:
\[\sqrt{8x_1} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{x_1}}x_1 = \sqrt{8x_1} - \sqrt{2x_1} = \sqrt{2x_1}(2 - 1) = \sqrt{2x_1}.\]
So, the distance is:
\[\frac{\sqrt{2x_1}}{\sqrt{\frac{2 + x_1}{x_1}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2x_1} \cdot \sqrt{x_1}}{\sqrt{2 + x_1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}x_1}{\sqrt{2 + x_1}} = \sqrt{2}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[\frac{2x_1^2}{2 + x_1} = 2 \implies x_1^2 = 2 + x_1 \implies x_1^2 - x_1 - 2 = 0 \implies (x_1 - 2)(x_1 + 1) = 0.\]
Since \(x_1 > 0\), we have \(x_1 = 2\). Therefore, \(y_1 = \sqrt{8 \cdot 2} = 4\). The point of tangency in the first quadrant is \((2, 4)\).

By symmetry, the point of tangency in the fourth quadrant is \((2, -4)\). The points of tangency in the second and third quadrants are \((-2, 4)\) and \((-2, -4)\), respectively.

The quadrilateral formed by these points is a rectangle with side lengths \(4\) and \(4\). The area of the rectangle is:

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) is given by:

\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

For the given sequence \(\left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\}\), the first term \( a \) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) and the common ratio \( r \) is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ S_n = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) \]

We are given that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \(\frac{255}{512}\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{255}{512} \]

To eliminate the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{510}{512} = \frac{255}{256} \]

Next, we isolate \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\) by subtracting \(\frac{255}{256}\) from 1:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 1 - \frac{255}{256} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Since \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{256}\) and \(\frac{1}{256} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\), we have:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 \]

"To find the modular inverse of \(17\) modulo \(83\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

This means we need to solve the equation:

\[17x = 83k + 1\]

for integers \(x\) and \(k\). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find such \(x\) and \(k\).

First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(17\) and \(83\):

1. \(83 = 4 \cdot 17 + 15\)
2. \(17 = 1 \cdot 15 + 2\)
3. \(15 = 7 \cdot 2 + 1\)
4. \(2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 0\)

The gcd is \(1\), and since it is \(1\), \(17\) and \(83\) are coprime, and an inverse exists.

Next, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a combination of \(17\) and \(83\):

Starting from the second last equation:

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 2\]

Substitute \(2\) from the previous equation \(2 = 17 - 1 \cdot 15\):

\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot (17 - 1 \cdot 15)\]
\[1 = 15 - 7 \cdot 17 + 7 \cdot 15\]
\[1 = 15 + 7 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 15 - 7 \cdot 17\]

Substitute \(15\) from the first equation \(15 = 83 - 4 \cdot 17\):

\[1 = 8 \cdot (83 - 4 \cdot 17) - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 32 \cdot 17 - 7 \cdot 17\]
\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

Thus, we have:

\[1 = 8 \cdot 83 - 39 \cdot 17\]

This equation shows that:

\[-39 \cdot 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\]

Since we want a positive integer solution, we convert \(-39\) to a positive equivalent modulo \(83\):

\[-39 \equiv 83 - 39 \pmod{83}\]
\[-39 \equiv 44 \pmod{83}\]

"To solve the congruence \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\), we need to find the smallest positive integer solutions for \(u\). Let's proceed step by step.

First, we simplify the congruence by dividing all terms by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 14, 46, and 100. The gcd of 14 and 100 is 2, and the gcd of 2 and 46 is 2. Therefore, we divide the entire congruence by 2:
\[
7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}
\]

Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50. The multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is a number \(x\) such that:
\[
7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. First, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of 7 and 50:
\[
50 = 7 \cdot 7 + 1
\]
\[
7 = 7 \cdot 1 + 0
\]
The gcd is 1, and since it is 1, 7 and 50 are coprime, and an inverse exists. Now, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express 1 as a combination of 7 and 50:
\[
1 = 50 - 7 \cdot 7
\]
This equation tells us that \(x = -7\) is a solution to \(7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\). However, we want a positive inverse, so we add 50 to \(-7\):
\[
x = -7 + 50 = 43
\]
Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 50 is 43.

Now, we multiply both sides of the congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\) by 43:
\[
43 \cdot 7u \equiv 43 \cdot 23 \pmod{50}
\]
\[
301u \equiv 989 \pmod{50}
\]
Since \(301 \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\), the congruence simplifies to:
\[
u \equiv 989 \pmod{50}
\]
We reduce 989 modulo 50:
\[
989 \div 50 = 19.78 \quad \text{(integer part is 19)}
\]
\[
989 - 19 \cdot 50 = 989 - 950 = 39
\]
Thus, the solution to the congruence is:
\[
u \equiv 39 \pmod{50}
\]
The smallest positive integer solution is \(u = 39\). Since the congruence is linear and has a unique solution modulo 50, the only solution in the range from 1 to 50 is 39. Therefore, the only positive integer solution is 39.

The problem asks for the average of the two smallest positive integer solutions. Since there is only one solution, the average is simply the solution itself:

\[a + b = 13\]

When the digits are swapped, the new number becomes \(10b + a\). The difference between the original number and the number with swapped digits is given as 27, so we can write:

\[(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[10a + b - 10b - a = 9a - 9b = 9(a - b)\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[9(a - b) = 27\]

Dividing both sides by 9, we find:

\[a - b = 3\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(a + b = 13\)
2. \(a - b = 3\)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:

The number with swapped digits is \(10b + a = 10 \cdot 5 + 8 = 58\).

3. \(a - 3b = 7\)
4. \(c - 3d = -1\)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, solve equations 1 and 3 for \(a\) and \(b\):

From equation 1: \(b = 2a - 9\)

Substitute \(b = 2a - 9\) into equation 3:

\[
a - 3(2a - 9) = 7 \implies a - 6a + 27 = 7 \implies -5a + 27 = 7 \implies -5a = -20 \implies a = 4
\]

Now substitute \(a = 4\) back into \(b = 2a - 9\):

\[
b = 2(4) - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1
\]

So, \(a = 4\) and \(b = -1\). Next, solve equations 2 and 4 for \(c\) and \(d\):

From equation 2: \(d = 2c - 3\)

Substitute \(d = 2c - 3\) into equation 4:

\[
c - 3(2c - 3) = -1 \implies c - 6c + 9 = -1 \implies -5c + 9 = -1 \implies -5c = -10 \implies c = 2
\]

Now substitute \(c = 2\) back into \(d = 2c - 3\):

\[
d = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1
\]

So, \(c = 2\) and \(d = 1\). Therefore, the matrix \(\mathbf{M}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the image of the line \(y = 2x + 1\) under the transformation \(\mathbf{M}\). A point \((x, y)\) on the line \(y = 2x + 1\) can be written as \((x, 2x + 1)\). The image of this point under \(\mathbf{M}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4x - (2x + 1) \\ 2x + (2x + 1) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x - 1 \\ 4x + 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let the image point be \((x', y')\). Then \(x' = 2x - 1\) and \(y' = 4x + 1\). We can express \(x\) in terms of \(x'\):

\[
x = \frac{x' + 1}{2}
\]

Substitute \(x = \frac{x' + 1}{2}\) into \(y' = 4x + 1\):

\[
y' = 4\left(\frac{x' + 1}{2}\right) + 1 = 2(x' + 1) + 1 = 2x' + 2 + 1 = 2x' + 3
\]

Therefore, the equation of the image line is:

\[
y = 2x + 3
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{y = 2x + 3}

"To determine how many different ways 5 students can be selected from a group of 6 students, we need to use the concept of combinations. The order in which the students are selected does not matter, so we use the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Here, \( n \) is the total number of students, which is 6, and \( r \) is the number of students to be selected, which is 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = \frac{6}{1} = 6

"To find the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we will use the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, and factoring techniques.

### Step 1: Rational Root Theorem
The Rational Root Theorem states that any potential rational root, \(p/q\), of the polynomial \(a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\) is a factor of the constant term \(a_0\) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \(a_n\). For the polynomial \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14\), the constant term \(a_0\) is \(-14\) and the leading coefficient \(a_n\) is \(1\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-14\), which are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14\).

### Step 2: Testing Possible Rational Roots
We will test these possible roots using synthetic division.

#### Testing \(x = 1\):
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
1 & 1 & 5 & 9 & -1 & -14 \\
  &   & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
Since the remainder is \(0\), \(x = 1\) is a root. The quotient is \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\).

#### Testing \(x = -1\):
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
-1 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
   &   & -1 & -5 & -10 \\
\hline
   & 1 & 5 & 10 & 4 \\
\end{array}
\]
Since the remainder is not \(0\), \(x = -1\) is not a root.

#### Testing \(x = 2\):
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
2 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
  &   & 2 & 16 & 52 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 8 & 31 & 66 \\
\end{array}
\]
Since the remainder is not \(0\), \(x = 2\) is not a root.

#### Testing \(x = -2\):
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
-2 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
   &   & -2 & -8 & -14 \\
\hline
   & 1 & 4 & 7 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
Since the remainder is \(0\), \(x = -2\) is a root. The quotient is \(x^2 + 4x + 7\).

### Step 3: Factoring the Quotient
The quotient \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) is a quadratic polynomial. We can check if it has real roots by calculating the discriminant:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7 = 16 - 28 = -12
\]
Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) has no real roots. Therefore, the only real roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14\) are \(x = 1\) and \(x = -2\).

### Step 4: Finding the Complex Roots
The complex roots of the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) can be found using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm 2i\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \pm i\sqrt{3}
\]
Thus, the complex roots are \(x = -2 + i\sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -2 - i\sqrt{3}\).

### Final Answer
The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\) are:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:
\[
q = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
Next, we use the quotient to find the remainder \(r\). According to the division algorithm, we have:
\[
54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r
\]
Calculating the product \(6 \cdot 9\), we get:
\[
6 \cdot 9 = 54
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
54 = 54 + r
\]
To isolate \(r\), we subtract 54 from both sides of the equation:
\[
0 = r

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the total number of students who attended the exam, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem. Let's denote the number of students in each group as follows:

- Let \( B \) be the number of students in Betty's group.
- Let \( W \) be the number of students in Wilma's group.
- Let \( M \) be the number of students in the other group.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total number of students is between 30 and 50.
2. Betty's group has more students than Wilma's group.
3. Betty's group has more students than the other group.
4. Wilma's group has more students than the other group.

We can express these relationships with the following inequalities:
\[ B > W \]
\[ B > M \]
\[ W > M \]

Since \( B \) is greater than both \( W \) and \( M \), and \( W \) is greater than \( M \), we can conclude that \( B \) is the largest group. The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ B + W + M \]

We need to find values for \( B \), \( W \), and \( M \) that satisfy the inequalities and the condition that the total number of students is between 30 and 50. Let's start by testing possible values for \( B \).

"To determine the maliyeti of a 3-inch cube, we need to first understand the relationship between the surface area and the volume of the cube, and then use the given maliyet rates for the surface area and the volume of the cube.

1. **Calculate the surface area and volume of a cube:**
   - The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
     \[
     A = 6s^2
     \]
   - The volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
     \[
     V = s^3

2. **Given maliyet rates:**
   - The maliyet for the surface area is \$1.30 per square inch.
   - The maliyet for the volume is \$6.80 per cubic inch.

3. **Calculate the maliyet for a 1-inch cube:**
   - The surface area of a 1-inch cube is:
     \[
     A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \text{ square inches}
     \]
   - The maliyet for the surface area is:
     \[
     \text{Maliyet for surface area} = 6 \times 1.30 = 7.80 \text{ dollars}

   - The maliyet for the volume is:
     \[
     \text{Maliyet for volume} = 1 \times 6.80 = 6.80 \text{ dollars}

4. **Verify the relationship between the maliyet rates:**
   - The ratio of the maliyet for the surface area to the maliyet for the volume is:
     \[
     \frac{7.80}{6.80} = \frac{39}{34} \approx 1.147
     \]
   - This ratio is approximately equal to the ratio of the surface area to the volume of the cube, which is:

   - For a 1-inch cube, this ratio is:
     \[

"To find the measure of \(\angle STR\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), \(\angle P = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\).

First, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle PRQ\). Since \(\angle P\) and \(\angle PRQ\) are supplementary (they form a straight line), we have:
\[
\angle PRQ = 180^\circ - \angle P = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ.

Next, we use the fact that \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\). This means that \(\angle STR\) is an alternate interior angle to \(\angle PRQ\). Therefore, \(\angle STR\) is equal to \(\angle PRQ\):

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given values step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:

The denominator of the expression is \( x^2 - 9 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 9 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.

First, we recognize that \( x^2 - 9 \) is a difference of squares. The difference of squares formula is \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). Here, \( a = x \) and \( b = 3 \), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3 \]

Therefore, the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \). This means the expression \(\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}\) is undefined for \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \).

x^2 - y^2 = 36. \tag{1}
\]

Next, let's simplify the second equation. The property \(\log_b a = c\) implies \(b^c = a\) allows us to rewrite the equation as:
\[
y^2 = 5x. \tag{2}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(x^2 - y^2 = 36\)
2. \(y^2 = 5x\)

We can substitute \(y^2\) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x = 36.
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0.
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-36\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-9\) and \(4\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic equation as:
\[
(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0.
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[
x - 9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 4 = 0,
\]
\[
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4.
\]

Since \(x\) must be positive (because it appears in the expression \(\log_6 (x-y)\) and \(\log_6 (x+y)\), which are defined only for positive arguments), we discard \(x = -4\) and keep \(x = 9\).

To verify, we substitute \(x = 9\) back into the second equation to find \(y\):
\[
y^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45,
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}.
\]
We check the first equation with \(x = 9\) and \(y = 3\sqrt{5}\):
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 9^2 - (3\sqrt{5})^2 = 81 - 45 = 36.
\]
The solution satisfies both equations.

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To determine the fifth number in a list of the first five positive integers that have exactly three positive divisors, we need to understand the properties of such numbers. A positive integer has exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because the divisors of \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is a prime number) are \( 1, p, \) and \( p^2 \).

Let's list the squares of the first few prime numbers in ascending order:
1. The square of the first prime number, 2, is \( 2^2 = 4 \).
2. The square of the second prime number, 3, is \( 3^2 = 9 \).
3. The square of the third prime number, 5, is \( 5^2 = 25 \).
4. The square of the fourth prime number, 7, is \( 7^2 = 49 \).
5. The square of the fifth prime number, 11, is \( 11^2 = 121 \).

Thus, the first five positive integers that have exactly three positive divisors are \( 4, 9, 25, 49, \) and \( 121 \). The fifth number in this list is \( 121 \).

"To solve the given equation \(z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0\), we can recognize that it is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and the common ratio \(r = -z\). The sum of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by \(\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}\). For our series, this becomes:

\[
\frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 - (-z)} = \frac{1 + z^9}{1 + z} = 0
\]

This implies that \(1 + z^9 = 0\), or \(z^9 = -1\). The solutions to this equation are the ninth roots of \(-1\), which can be written as:

\[
z = e^{i\theta} \quad \text{where} \quad \theta = \frac{(2k+1)\pi}{9} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8

These are the nine complex numbers on the unit circle that are equally spaced and satisfy \(z^9 = -1\). The angles \(\theta\) are:

\[

\]

First, we convert \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) to have a common denominator of 9:

\[
\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{3\pi}{9}, \quad \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{15\pi}{9}
\]

Now we can add all the angles together:

\[
\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{3\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \frac{9\pi}{9} + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{15\pi}{9} + \frac{17\pi}{9} = \frac{(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17)\pi}{9}
\]

The sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 17 is:

\[
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 81

"To determine how many integer values of \( t \) satisfy the condition that the square root of \( t \) is greater than 2 but less than 3.5, we start by expressing this condition mathematically:

\[ 2^2 < t < 3.5^2 \]

Since \(16 < 20 < 25\), it follows that:

"To find the maximum value of the expression \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \) given the constraint \( a + b + c + d = 10 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
\]

with equality if and only if \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n \).

To apply the AM-GM inequality to our problem, we rewrite the constraint \( a + b + c + d = 10 \) in a form that matches the terms in the expression \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \). We can think of \( a \) as \( \frac{a}{1} \), \( b \) as \( \frac{b}{2} \), \( c \) as \( \frac{c}{3} \), and \( d \) as \( \frac{d}{4} \). This gives us:

\[
\frac{a}{1} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} = \frac{a + b + c + d}{10} \cdot 10 = 10
\]

Now, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \( \frac{a}{1}, \frac{b}{2}, \frac{c}{3}, \frac{d}{4} \):

\[
\frac{\frac{a}{1} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4}}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{a}{1} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{c}{3} \cdot \frac{d}{4}}
\]

Since \( \frac{a}{1} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{3} + \frac{d}{4} = 10 \), we have:

\[
\frac{10}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{a}{1} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{c}{3} \cdot \frac{d}{4}}
\]

\[
\frac{5}{2} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{abcd}{24}}
\]

Raising both sides to the fourth power, we get:

\[
\left( \frac{5}{2} \right)^4 \geq \frac{abcd}{24}
\]

\[
\frac{625}{16} \geq \frac{abcd}{24}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 24, we obtain:

\[
\frac{625 \cdot 24}{16} \geq abcd
\]

\[
\frac{15000}{16} \geq abcd
\]

\[
937.5 \geq abcd
\]

To find the maximum value of \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \), we need to check when equality holds in the AM-GM inequality, which occurs when \( \frac{a}{1} = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{3} = \frac{d}{4} \). Let \( \frac{a}{1} = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{3} = \frac{d}{4} = k \). Then \( a = k \), \( b = 2k \), \( c = 3k \), and \( d = 4k \). Substituting these into the constraint \( a + b + c + d = 10 \), we get:

\[
k + 2k + 3k + 4k = 10
\]

\[
10k = 10
\]

\[
k = 1
\]

So, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 3 \), and \( d = 4 \). Substituting these values into the expression \( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \), we get:

\[

"To determine how far a car traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour will travel in \(2 \frac{3}{4}\) hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the mixed number \(2 \frac{3}{4}\) into an improper fraction.
2. Multiply the speed by the time to find the distance.

First, let's convert the mixed number \(2 \frac{3}{4}\) into an improper fraction. The number \(2 \frac{3}{4}\) can be written as:
\[2 \frac{3}{4} = 2 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{4}.\]

where \( S \) is the magic constant.

The change of base formula states that \(\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}\). We will use the natural logarithm (base \(e\)) for convenience.

Applying the change of base formula to each term in the expression, we get:

We are also given that the probability of getting a sum of 7 is \( \frac{47}{288} \) when two such dice are rolled.

First, let's denote the face \( F \) as \( f \). The other die can show any of the numbers from 1 to 6 except \( f \). Therefore, there are 5 possible outcomes for the other die.

The possible pairs \((f, g)\) that sum to 7 are:

There are 6 such pairs. Since there are 5 possible outcomes for the other die, the total number of favorable outcomes is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \).

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) (since one die is fixed to show \( f \) and the other die can show any of the 5 remaining numbers).

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha starts at the other end of the tarlan and travels to the midpoint. Since the tarlan is 400 feet long, the midpoint is 200 feet from either end. Therefore, Martha travels 200 feet.

We need to find the values of \( B \) such that \( 10B + 6 \) is a perfect square. Let's denote the perfect square by \( n^2 \). Therefore, we have the equation:

Rearranging this equation to solve for \( B \), we get:

Since \( B \) is a digit from 1 to 9, \( n^2 - 6 \) must be an integer between 10 and 90 (inclusive). Therefore, \( n^2 \) must be an integer between 16 and 96 (inclusive). We now list the perfect squares in this range:

Q(y) = (2010\sqrt{y} - 4)(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)(y-4).
\]

The polynomial \(Q(y)\) is a polynomial of degree 3, and the polynomial \((2010\sqrt{y} - 4)(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)(y-4)\) is a polynomial of degree 5. The roots of the equation are the roots of \(Q(y)\) and the roots of the equation \(2010\sqrt{y} - 4 = 0\). The roots of \(2010\sqrt{y} - 4 = 0\) are \(\left(\frac{4}{2010}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1005}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{1010025}\), which is a real number.

The sum of the roots of the polynomial \(Q(y)\) is given by the coefficient of \(y^2\) in \(Q(y)\) with a sign change, divided by the leading coefficient. However, we need to consider the complex roots of the equation \(2010\sqrt{y} - 4 = 0\). Since \(\sqrt{y}\) is a square root, the roots are \(\frac{2}{1005}\) and \(-\frac{2}{1005}\). The sum of these roots is:

\[
\frac{2}{1005} + \left(-\frac{2}{1005}\right) = 0.
\]

Therefore, the sum of all the complex solutions to the original equation is the sum of the roots of \(Q(y)\), which is 0. Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all prime numbers \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution for \( x \). This congruence has a solution if and only if 8 and \( p \) are coprime, i.e., \( \gcd(8, p) = 1 \). Since 8 is \( 2^3 \), the prime \( p \) must be different from 2. Therefore, the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution for all primes \( p \neq 2 \).

The only prime number that is not included in this set is \( p = 2 \). For \( p = 2 \), the congruence becomes \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), which simplifies to \( 0 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \). This is a contradiction, so the congruence has no solution for \( p = 2 \).

Thus, the primes \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution are all primes except 2. The sum of all prime numbers is infinite, but the sum of all primes except 2 is still infinite because removing a single prime from an infinite set does not change its infinity.

However, the problem asks for the sum of all such primes, and since the sum of all primes is infinite, the sum of all primes except 2 is also infinite. Therefore, the answer is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) into the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

"To simplify the given expression, we start by examining the general term in the numerator and the denominator. The expression is:

\]

First, we simplify the general term \((2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\). We have:

\[
(2k)^4 = 16k^4 \quad \text{so} \quad (2k)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = 16k^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{64k^4 + 1}{4}
\]

Similarly, the general term \((2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4}\) is:

\[
(2k-1)^4 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{64(2k-1)^4 + 1}{4}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

Notice that the term \(64 \cdot 1^4 + 1\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. Similarly, the term \(64 \cdot 3^4 + 1\) cancels out, and so on. The only terms that do not cancel are the terms where the denominator has a factor but the numerator does not. Specifically, the term \(64 \cdot n^4 + 1\) in the numerator does not have a corresponding term in the denominator.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly chosen positive integer less than 2010 is a terminating decimal. A fraction in its simplest form has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Therefore, the reciprocal of a positive integer \( n \) is a terminating decimal if and only if \( n \) is of the form \( 2^a \times 5^b \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

First, we need to find the number of positive integers less than 2010 that are of the form \( 2^a \times 5^b \). This is equivalent to finding the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \( 2^a \times 5^b < 2010 \).

We will consider the possible values for \( b \) and then find the corresponding maximum values for \( a \).

1. If \( b = 0 \), then \( 2^a < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 10 \) because \( 2^{10} = 1024 \) and \( 2^{11} = 2048 \). So, there are 11 possible values for \( a \) (0 through 10).
2. If \( b = 1 \), then \( 2^a \times 5 < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 9 \) because \( 2^9 \times 5 = 256 \times 5 = 1280 \) and \( 2^{10} \times 5 = 1024 \times 5 = 5120 \). So, there are 10 possible values for \( a \) (0 through 9).
3. If \( b = 2 \), then \( 2^a \times 25 < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 7 \) because \( 2^7 \times 25 = 128 \times 25 = 3200 \) and \( 2^8 \times 25 = 256 \times 25 = 6400 \). So, there are 8 possible values for \( a \) (0 through 7).
4. If \( b = 3 \), then \( 2^a \times 125 < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 4 \) because \( 2^4 \times 125 = 16 \times 125 = 2000 \) and \( 2^5 \times 125 = 32 \times 125 = 4000 \). So, there are 5 possible values for \( a \) (0 through 4).
5. If \( b = 4 \), then \( 2^a \times 625 < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 1 \) because \( 2^1 \times 625 = 2 \times 625 = 1250 \) and \( 2^2 \times 625 = 4 \times 625 = 2500 \). So, there are 2 possible values for \( a \) (0 through 1).
6. If \( b = 5 \), then \( 2^a \times 3125 < 2010 \). The largest integer \( a \) satisfying this is \( a = 0 \) because \( 2^0 \times 3125 = 3125 \) and \( 2^1 \times 3125 = 6250 \). So, there is 1 possible value for \( a \) (0).

Adding up all these possible values, we get:
\[ 11 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 37 \]

So, there are 37 positive integers less than 2010 that are of the form \( 2^a \times 5^b \).

Next, we need to find the total number of positive integers less than 2010. This is simply 2009 (since we are considering the integers from 1 to 2009).

The probability that the reciprocal of a randomly chosen positive integer less than 2010 is a terminating decimal is:
\[ \frac{37}{2009} \]

Since 37 and 2009 are coprime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, \( a = 37 \) and \( b = 2009 \), and \( a + b = 37 + 2009 = 2046 \).

"To find \(\tan A\) for the triangle \(ABC\) with the given condition that the area of the triangle is equal to \(a^2 - (b - c)^2\), we start by expressing the area of the triangle in two different ways.

First, the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be given by the formula:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A
\]
According to the problem, this area is also equal to \(a^2 - (b - c)^2\). So, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2
\]
Using the Law of Cosines, which states \(a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A\), we substitute \(a^2\) in the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = 2bc - 2bc \cos A
\]
Factoring out \(2bc\) on the right-hand side, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = 2bc (1 - \cos A)
\]
Since \(bc \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(bc\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin A = 2 (1 - \cos A)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
\sin A = 4 (1 - \cos A)
\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\), we substitute \(\sin A = 4 (1 - \cos A)\):
\[
[4 (1 - \cos A)]^2 + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
16 (1 - 2 \cos A + \cos^2 A) + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
\[
16 - 32 \cos A + 16 \cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
17 \cos^2 A - 32 \cos A + 15 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(\cos A\). We solve it using the quadratic formula \(\cos A = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 17\), \(b = -32\), and \(c = 15\):
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15}}{2 \cdot 17}
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34}
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{4}}{34}
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{32 \pm 2}{34}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
\cos A = \frac{34}{34} = 1 \quad \text{(not possible for a triangle)}
\]
\[
\cos A = \frac{30}{34} = \frac{15}{17}
\]
Since \(\cos A = \frac{15}{17}\), we find \(\sin A\) using \(\sin A = 4 (1 - \cos A)\):
\[
\sin A = 4 \left(1 - \frac{15}{17}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{2}{17}\right) = \frac{8}{17}
\]
Finally, we find \(\tan A\) using \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\):
\[
\tan A = \frac{\frac{8}{17}}{\frac{15}{17}} = \frac{8}{15}
\]
Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}} = 6\), we start by letting \(y = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}}\). According to the problem, we know that \(y = 6\).

First, we square both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}}\right)^2 = 6^2.
\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[
x + \sqrt{3x + 6} + 2\sqrt{(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6})} + x - \sqrt{3x + 6} = 36.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
2x + 2\sqrt{(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6})} = 36.
\]
Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
(x + \sqrt{3x + 6})(x - \sqrt{3x + 6}) = x^2 - (\sqrt{3x + 6})^2 = x^2 - (3x + 6) = x^2 - 3x - 6.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
2x + 2\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 36.
\]
We can simplify this by dividing every term by 2:
\[
x + \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18.
\]
Next, we isolate the square root term by subtracting \(x\) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18 - x.
\]
We then square both sides again to eliminate the square root:
\[
x^2 - 3x - 6 = (18 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding the right side, we get:
\[
x^2 - 3x - 6 = 324 - 36x + x^2.
\]
We can simplify this by subtracting \(x^2\) from both sides:
\[
-3x - 6 = 324 - 36x.
\]
Next, we add \(36x\) to both sides:
\[
33x - 6 = 324.
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
33x = 330.
\]
Finally, we divide both sides by 33:
\[
x = 10.
\]
To ensure that our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = 10\) back into the original equation:
\[
\sqrt{10 + \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} = \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{30 + 6}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{30 + 6}} = \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{36}} = \sqrt{10 + 6} + \sqrt{10 - 6} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{4} = 4 + 2 = 6.

First, let's list the given distances:
- \( AB = 5 \)
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( AD = 3 \)
- \( BC = 6 \)
- \( CD = 4 \)
- \( DB = 5 \)

The shortest distance from \( A \) to the triangle \( BCD \) will be the minimum of the distances from \( A \) to the vertices and the distances from \( A \) to the sides.

From the given distances, the minimum distance from \( A \) to the vertices is \( AD = 3 \).

Next, we need to find the shortest distance from \( A \) to the sides of the triangle \( BCD \). The distance from a point to a line can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of triangle \( BCD \) can be calculated using Heron's formula.

First, we find the semi-perimeter \( s \) of triangle \( BCD \):
\[ s = \frac{BC + CD + DB}{2} = \frac{6 + 4 + 5}{2} = 7.5 \]

Next, we calculate the area \( K \) of triangle \( BCD \) using Heron's formula:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{7.5(7.5-6)(7.5-4)(7.5-5)} = \sqrt{7.5 \cdot 1.5 \cdot 3.5 \cdot 2.5} = \sqrt{98.4375} \approx 9.92 \]

The area of triangle \( BCD \) can also be expressed as:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

We can use any side as the base. Let's use \( BC \) as the base:
\[ 9.92 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{height} = \frac{9.92 \times 2}{6} \approx 3.31 \]

The distance from \( A \) to the side \( BC \) is approximately 3.31, which is greater than the distance from \( A \) to the vertex \( D \), which is 3.

1. **Identify the relationship between the sphere and the cube:**
   The sphere is inscribed in the cube in such a way that it touches the three faces of the cube at the corners. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.

For \(n = 12\), the sum \(S\) is:

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15| \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function within this interval. The function \( f(x) \) is a sum of absolute value functions, and the minimum value of such a function often occurs at a critical point or at the endpoints of the interval.

First, let's consider the critical points of \( f(x) \). The critical points are the values of \( x \) where the expression inside each absolute value changes sign. These points are \( x = p \), \( x = 15 \), and \( x = p + 15 \). However, since \( p + 15 \) is outside the interval \( [p, 15] \), we only need to consider \( x = p \) and \( x = 15 \).

We will evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval.

1. Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = p \):

Now, we compare the values of \( f(p) \) and \( f(15) \):
\[

Since \( 0 < p < 15 \), it follows that \( 30 - p > 15 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) in the interval \( [p, 15] \) is \( f(15) \).

The integer factorization of 33 is \( 33 = 3 \times 11 \times (-1) \times (-1) \times \cdots \times (-1) \) (with the appropriate number of \(-1\)s to make the product 33). To minimize \( |a_{n-1}| \), we should use the smallest possible absolute values for the roots. The smallest absolute values of the factors of 33 are 1, 1, 3, and 11. Therefore, we can choose the roots as \( r_1 = 1 \), \( r_2 = 1 \), \( r_3 = 3 \), and \( r_4 = 11 \) (or any permutation of these roots).

The polynomial then becomes:
\[ f(x) = 2 (x - 1)^2 (x - 3) (x - 11) \]
We need to expand this polynomial to find the coefficient \( a_{n-1} \). First, expand \( (x - 1)^2 \):
\[ (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \]
Next, expand \( (x^2 - 2x + 1)(x - 3) \):
\[ (x^2 - 2x + 1)(x - 3) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 2x^2 + 6x + x - 3 = x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3 \]
Finally, expand \( (x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3)(x - 11) \):
\[ (x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3)(x - 11) = x^4 - 11x^3 - 5x^3 + 55x^2 + 7x^2 - 77x - 3x + 33 = x^4 - 16x^3 + 62x^2 - 80x + 33 \]
Multiplying by 2, we get:
\[ f(x) = 2(x^4 - 16x^3 + 62x^2 - 80x + 33) = 2x^4 - 32x^3 + 124x^2 - 160x + 66 \]

"To determine how many different combinations of people can be formed from the items in the Bay Patates Kafa, we need to consider the constraints and calculate the number of valid combinations step by step.

1. **Identify the items and their counts:**
   - 3 boys
   - 2 girls
   - 1 couple (one boy and one girl)
   - 2 boys
   - 2 girls
   - 1 couple (one boy and one girl)
   - 1 bonus couple (one boy and one girl)

2. **Combine the items:**
   - Total boys: \(3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7\)
   - Total girls: \(2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\)
   - Total couples: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 people from the total pool of 13 people (7 boys + 6 girls):**
   The number of ways to choose 2 people from 13 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{13}{2} \):
   \[
   \binom{13}{2} = \frac{13 \times 12}{2 \times 1} = 78
   \]

4. **Subtract the invalid combinations:**
   - ** couples:** There are 2 couples, and choosing both members of a couple is invalid. The number of ways to choose both members of a couple is 2 (one couple from the first couple and one couple from the second couple).
   - ** singles:** There are 7 boys and 6 girls, so the number of ways to choose 2 boys is \( \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21 \) and the number of ways to choose 2 girls is \( \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \).

   Therefore, the total number of invalid combinations is:
   \[
   2 \text{ (couples)} + 21 \text{ (boys)} + 15 \text{ (girls)} = 38

5. **Calculate the number of valid combinations:**

"To determine the equation of the line on which the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) lies, we start with the given information that the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is the zero vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\). The formula for the projection of a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is given by:

\[
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). Since the projection is the zero vector, we have:

\[
\frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This implies that the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\) must be zero. Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then:

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2x + y

Setting this equal to zero, we get:

This is the equation of the line on which the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) lies. To express this in the form \(y = mx + b\), we solve for \(y\):

"To find the value of \(a + b + c\) where \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3 = a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{6}\), we start by expanding \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3\).

First, we use the binomial theorem:
\[
(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3 = \binom{3}{0} (\sqrt{2})^3 (\sqrt{3})^0 + \binom{3}{1} (\sqrt{2})^2 (\sqrt{3})^1 + \binom{3}{2} (\sqrt{2})^1 (\sqrt{3})^2 + \binom{3}{3} (\sqrt{2})^0 (\sqrt{3})^3
\]
Calculating each term individually, we get:
\[
\binom{3}{0} (\sqrt{2})^3 (\sqrt{3})^0 = 1 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} \cdot 1 = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\binom{3}{1} (\sqrt{2})^2 (\sqrt{3})^1 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}
\]
\[
\binom{3}{2} (\sqrt{2})^1 (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 = 9\sqrt{6}
\]
\[
\binom{3}{3} (\sqrt{2})^0 (\sqrt{3})^3 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 3\sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}

Adding these terms together, we get:
\[
2\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} + 9\sqrt{6} + 3\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{3} + 9\sqrt{6}

Thus, we can see that \(a = 2\), \(b = 9\), and \(c = 9\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b + c\) is:

"To determine the area of the region \( S \) defined by the conditions \( 0 \le a, b \le 1 \) and the polynomial \( x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) having at least one real root, we start by analyzing the polynomial.

First, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 \). If \( x = r \) is a real root, then \( P(r) = 0 \). We can rewrite the polynomial as:
\[ P(x) = x^4 + 1 + ax(x^2 + 1) - bx^2. \]

To find the conditions on \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( P(x) \) has a real root, we can use the fact that the polynomial is symmetric. Let's substitute \( x = \frac{1}{x} \) into \( P(x) \):
\[ P\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^4 + a\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^3 - b\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 + a\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + 1 = \frac{1 + ax + a - bx^2 + x^4}{x^4} = P(x). \]
This shows that \( P(x) \) is an even function with respect to the transformation \( x \to \frac{1}{x} \).

Now, let's consider the case when \( x = 1 \):
\[ P(1) = 1 + a - b + a + 1 = 2 + 2a - b. \]
For \( P(1) = 0 \), we need:
\[ 2 + 2a - b = 0 \implies b = 2 + 2a. \]
Since \( 0 \le a, b \le 1 \), the only solution is \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = 1 \). Therefore, the point \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right) \) is in the region \( S \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = -1 \):
\[ P(-1) = 1 - a - b - a + 1 = 2 - 2a - b. \]
For \( P(-1) = 0 \), we need:
\[ 2 - 2a - b = 0 \implies b = 2 - 2a. \]
Since \( 0 \le a, b \le 1 \), the only solution is \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = 0 \). Therefore, the point \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \) is in the region \( S \).

The region \( S \) is a square with vertices at \( (0,0) \), \( (0,1) \), \( (1,0) \), and \( (1,1) \) with a smaller square removed. The smaller square has vertices at \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \), \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right) \), \( \left( 1, \frac{1}{2} \right) \), and \( \left( 0, \frac{1}{2} \right) \). The area of the larger square is \( 1 \) and the area of the smaller square is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the area of the region \( S \) is:

"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the function is defined and does not lead to any undefined forms, such as division by zero or taking the logarithm of a non-positive number.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the constraints from the denominator:**
   The denominator of the function is \( \log(2 - \log(x-2)) \). For the logarithm to be defined, the argument inside the logarithm must be positive:
   \[
   2 - \log(x-2) > 0
   \]
   Solving this inequality:
   \[
   2 > \log(x-2)
   \]
   Converting this to exponential form with base 10:
   \[
   10^2 > x-2
   \]
   \[
   100 > x-2
   \]
   \[
   102 > x
   \]
   \[
   x < 102
   \]

2. **Identify the constraints from the argument of the outer logarithm:**
   The argument of the outer logarithm is \( x-2 \). For the logarithm to be defined, the argument must be positive:
   \[
   x-2 > 0
   \]
   Solving this inequality:
   \[
   x > 2
   \]

3. **Combine the constraints:**
   From the two inequalities, we have:
   \[
   2 < x < 102
   \]

4. **Check for any additional constraints from the numerator:**
   The numerator of the function is \( 2-x \). This expression is defined for all \( x \) in the interval \( (2, 102) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))} \) is:

"To find the value of \( |w| \) where \( w = \frac{3z+1}{5z+7} \) and \( z = 1+i \), we will follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( z = 1+i \) into the expression for \( w \).
2. Simplify the expression for \( w \).
3. Find the magnitude of the simplified complex number \( w \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ w = \frac{3(1+i) + 1}{5(1+i) + 7} \]

First, simplify the numerator:

\[ 3(1+i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i \]

Next, simplify the denominator:

\[ 5(1+i) + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i \]

So, we have:

\[ w = \frac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i} \]

To find the magnitude of \( w \), we use the property of magnitudes of complex numbers that states \( \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|} \). Therefore, we need to find the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator.

The magnitude of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

First, find the magnitude of the numerator \( 4 + 3i \):

\[ |4 + 3i| = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]

Next, find the magnitude of the denominator \( 12 + 5i \):

\[ |12 + 5i| = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \]

Now, we can find the magnitude of \( w \):

\[ |w| = \frac{|4 + 3i|}{|12 + 5i|} = \frac{5}{13} \]

Therefore, the value of \( |w| \) is:

"To find the area of the given octagon, we start by understanding its structure. The octagon has four sides of length 1 and four sides of length \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), with each pair of adjacent sides having the same length. This configuration suggests that the octagon can be divided into simpler shapes, specifically squares and right triangles.

First, let's visualize the octagon. We can draw a square with side length 1 and then cut out four right triangles from the corners of the square. Each right triangle has legs of length \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since the side length of the octagon is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) and the side length of the square is 1, the legs of the right triangle are the differences between these lengths, which is \(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)).

The area of the square is:
\[
1^2 = 1
\]

The area of one right triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Since there are four such right triangles, the total area of the four right triangles is:
\[
4 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the area of the four right triangles:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the area of the octagon is:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given recurrence relation and the condition \(a_3 = a_1\). The recurrence relation is:
\[a_{i+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}.\]

First, let's find the first few terms of the sequence in terms of \(a_1\):
\[a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1},\]
\[a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1} = 1 - \frac{1}{a_1}.\]

Given that \(a_3 = a_1\), we substitute \(a_3\) with \(1 - \frac{1}{a_1}\):
\[1 - \frac{1}{a_1} = a_1.\]

To solve for \(a_1\), we multiply both sides by \(a_1\):
\[a_1 - 1 = a_1^2.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = 1\):
\[a_1 = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]

So, the solutions are:
\[a_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad a_1 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(a_9\). Since the sequence is periodic, we need to determine the period of the sequence. From the recurrence relation, we can see that:
\[a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = a_2,\]
\[a_5 = \frac{1}{1 - a_4} = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = a_3 = a_1,\]
\[a_6 = \frac{1}{1 - a_5} = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = a_2,\]
\[a_7 = \frac{1}{1 - a_6} = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = a_3 = a_1,\]
and so on. Therefore, the sequence is periodic with a period of 3:
\[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots.\]

Since \(a_9 = a_{3 \cdot 3} = a_3\), we have:
\[a_9 = a_3 = a_1.\]

Now, we need to find \(a_9^9\):
\[a_9^9 = a_1^9.\]

We know that \(a_1\) is a root of the equation \(a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we can express \(a_1^2\) as:
\[a_1^2 = a_1 - 1.\]

We can use this to find \(a_1^9\):
\[a_1^3 = a_1 \cdot a_1^2 = a_1(a_1 - 1) = a_1^2 - a_1 = (a_1 - 1) - a_1 = -1,\]
\[a_1^6 = (a_1^3)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1,\]
\[a_1^9 = a_1^6 \cdot a_1^3 = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1.\]
