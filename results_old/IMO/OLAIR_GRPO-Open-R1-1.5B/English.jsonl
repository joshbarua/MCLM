We have \\( n \\) lamps labeled from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 2n \\), initially all off. We need to determine the number of sequences of \\( k \\) steps that result in the state where lamps \\( 1 \\) through \\( n \\) are all on, and lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\) are all off, and none of the lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\) are ever switched on. Also, we need to find the number of such sequences where lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\) are never switched on. Finally, we need to determine the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\). </think><solution> \nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the transitions allowed in each step. The key observation here is that at each step, we can either switch a lamp from on to off or from off to on. We need to ensure that the lamps from \\( n+1 \\) to \\( 2n \\) remain off while lamps \\( 1 \\) to \\( n \\) are all on. This means that we need to ensure that we switch lamps \\( 1 \\) through \\( n \\) from off to on while keeping the lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\) always off. This implies that we can only switch lamps \\( 1 \\) through \\( n \\) in even-numbered steps. </solution><think> Now, let's reason about the number of steps at each end. We have \\( k = n + (n - 1)/2 \\). This is because we need to have \\( n \\) lamps on in increasing order while keeping lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\) always off. </think><solution> We need to make \\( N \\) sequences where all lamps \\( 1 \\) through \\( n \\) are on and we have \\( n \\) switches in \\( k \\) switches. The number of such sequences is \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n! \\). </solution><think> Now, let's see how the number of sequences \\( M \\) is determined. We need to make \\( M \\) sequences where all lamps \\( 1 \\) through \\( n \\) are on and we have \\( n \\) switches in \\( k \\) switches but where we never switch lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\). This means that we need to make \\( M \\) sequences where there are only \\( n - 1 \\) switches of \\( 2n \\) lamps where we never switch lamps \\( n+1 \\) through \\( 2n \\). The number of such sequences is \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n!\\times n^{k-n} \\times n^{n} \\). </think><solution> The ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is determined by the ratio of these two sequences, namely \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n!\\ \\div { k }\\choose n \\times n!\\times n^{k-n} \\times n^{n} \\). Hence, the ratio is \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n!\\ \\div { k }\\choose n \\times n!\\times n^{k-n} \\times n^{n\\ } \\). </solution><think> Using binomial theorem calculation, we have \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n!\\ \\div { k }\\choose n \\times n!\\times n^{k-n} \\times n^{n} \\). Hence, the ratio is \\({ k }\\choose n \\times n!\\ \\div { k }\\choose n \\times n!\\times n^{k-n} \\times n^{n\\ } \\). </think><solution> Hence, the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is \\( \\frac{k!}{(k-n)!} \\times \\frac{1}{n^{k-n}} \\) </solution><finally><boxed> The ratio \\( N/M \\) is \\( \\frac{k!}{(k-n)!} \\times \\frac{1}{n^{k-n}} \\) </boxed> </finally>", "answer": "2^{k-n}"}

If $g(m) = p^2$ is fixed, we have $$(p^2+n)(m+p^2)=p^2 \\implies n=p^2-m+1.$$ Hence, $n$ gets fixed for each $m$. Then, we have \\begin{align*} (g(m)+m)(m+g(m)) &= (g(m)+m) \\cdot \\left(m+(p^2-m+1)\\right) \\\\ & = g(m) \\cdot (p^2+1). \\end{align*} Since $g(m)$ gets fixed, we have $g(m)=(p^2+1)$ for all $m$. By induction, we have $g(n) = p^2+1$ for all $n$. Thus, $g(m) = p^2+1$ for all $m$.

This results in 4027 choose 2 lines, which is equal to 7,697,666. So there are 7,697,666 lines on plane and on this plane we can draw 7,697,666 - 4027 = 7,297,639 regions. And since no line passes through any point of the configuration, no region contains points of both colours, so we can draw 4026 lines such that any region doesn't have points of both colours.</solution><think>explanation</think><solution>Here is a good arrangement of 4026 lines:</solution><think>example</think><solution>These lines can divide the plane into 4026 regions. This arrangement works because no line goes through any point of the configuration. Moreover, no region contains points of both colours.</solution><think>improvement</think><solution>These are the lines arranged in order of increasing y-coordinates. We can improve on this solution by rearranging the lines so that no line goes through the origin.

that you can't simply go left to right.</solution><\\think><solution>It's because if you go left to right, some cars would be going up, while others would be going down.</solution><\\think><solution>Let's say someone would go left to right, like the $k^{th}$ car.</think><\\think><solution>That car would be going up and you would have to go down to link $X$ to $Y$.</think><\\think><solution>That means you can't use a car going up.</think><\\think><solution>Then, you must go right to left, so you'll be able to use the cars that are going down.</think><\\think><solution>That's because the $k^{th}$ car going up would be the $k$th car going down.</think><\\think><solution>And you'll have $n^2-k$ cars still
