Suppose there are 1004 or more good diagonals. Then there are at least 1004 pairs of vertices $A$ and $B$ such that the number of sides between $A$ and $B$ is odd. Since there are 2006 vertices, there must be at least one pair of vertices $C$ and $D$ such that the number of sides between $C$ and $D$ is even.

Otherwise, $a^p = b! + p \\geq p! + p > p^p$, which is a contradiction.  Also, $a < b + 1$, since otherwise $a^p = b! + p \\geq (b + 1)! + p > b^p$, which is a contradiction.  Therefore, $a = b$.\n\nNow, we have $a^p = a! + p$.  If $a \\geq p + 2$, then\n\\[ a! + p < (p + 1)! + p = (p + 1)(p!) + p < (p + 1)^p < a^p, \\]which is a contradiction.  Therefore, $a \\leq p + 1$.  If $a = p + 1$, then\n\\[ (p + 1)^p = p! + p \\leq p! + p! = 2p! < (p + 1)^p, \\]which is a contradiction.  Therefore, $a = p$, and so\n\\[ p^p = p! + p \\Longrightarrow p^{p - 1} = (p - 1)! + 1. \\]If $p = 2$, then $2 = 1! + 1$, so $(a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2)$ is a solution.  Otherwise, $p$ is odd, and so $p - 1$ is even.  Therefore, $p - 1$ divides $p^{p - 1} - 1 = (p - 1)!$, and so $p - 1$ divides $(p - 1)! - 1$.  This is a contradiction, so the only solution is $\\boxed{(2, 2, 2)}$. ", "answer": "(2, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)"}

We claim that $f(n) = n^2 - n + 1$.\n\nFirst, we show that $f(n) \\ge n^2 - n + 1$. Consider an $n \\times n$ Nordic square. Let $v$ be a valley in the square. Since $v$ is a valley, it is adjacent to at most 4 cells. If $v$ is adjacent to 0, 1, or 2 cells, then there is at least one uphill path starting at $v$. If $v$ is adjacent to 3 cells, then the numbers in the cells adjacent to $v$ must be greater than the number in $v$. Since there are $n^2$ numbers in the square, there are at least $n^2 - 3$ numbers that are not in the cells adjacent to $v$. Therefore, there is at least one uphill path starting at $v$ that does not include any of the numbers in the cells adjacent to $v$. If $v$ is adjacent to 4 cells, then the numbers in the cells adjacent to $v$ must be greater than the number in $v$. Since there are $n^2$ numbers in the square, there are at least $n^2 - 4$ numbers that are not in the cells adjacent to $v$. Therefore, there is at least one uphill path starting at $v$ that does not include any of the numbers in the cells adjacent to $v$.\n\nSince there are $n^2$ cells in the square, and each cell is a valley for at least one uphill path, there are at least $n^2$ uphill paths. However, we have counted each uphill path multiple times, once for each valley it contains. Since each uphill path contains at least one valley, and each valley is contained in at most $n^2 - n + 1$ uphill paths, we have overcounted by a factor of at most $n^2 - n + 1$. Therefore, the number of uphill paths is at least $\\frac{n^2}{n^2 - n + 1} \\ge n^2 - n + 1$.\n\nNext, we show that $f(n) \\le n^2 - n + 1$. Consider the following $n \\times n$ Nordic square:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n \\\\\n\\hline\nn+1 & n+2 & n+3 & \\cdots & 2n \\\\\n\\hline\n2n+1 & 2n+2 & 2n+3 & \\cdots & 3n \\\\\n\\hline\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\hline\nn^2-n+1 & n^2-n+2 & n^2-n+3 & \\cdots & n^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn this square, each number is adjacent to at most 4 other numbers. Therefore, each number is a valley for at most 4 uphill paths. Since there are $n^2$ numbers in the square, there are at most $4n^2$ uphill paths. However, we have overcounted each uphill path multiple times, once for each valley it contains. Since each uphill path contains at least one valley, and each valley is contained in at most $n^2 - n + 1$ uphill paths, we have overcounted by a factor of at most $n^2 - n + 1$.
