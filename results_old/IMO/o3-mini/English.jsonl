The triangle inequalities (specifically, c + c > a) force 2c > a, which cannot hold for all positive integers a. A similar analysis rules out functions like f(n) = n + r (with constant r ≠ 0) or any other nonlinear modifications, as a careful check (beginning with particular choices like b = 1 or a = 1) typically forces f(1) to equal 1 and then forces the increments to be exactly 1.\n\nA more detailed analysis (not reproduced here in full) shows that the condition f(b + f(a) - 1) < f(b) + a (deduced from inequality (I)) and the symmetry seen in (II) and (III) eventually force f to be the identity function.\n\nHence, the unique solution is f(n) = n for all positive integers n.", "answer": "f(x)=x"}

Each company (“A” or “B”) runs k cable‐cars; each cable–car goes from one station to a higher station. In each company the k cable cars have distinct starting stations and distinct finishing stations, and the cables can be “chained together” (that is, if the finishing station of one car is the same as the starting station of another, then a passenger may take that second car immediately). Thus each company’s operations form a collection of disjoint “chains” (directed paths) where a pair of stations from the same chain is said to be linked by that company.\n\nA natural question is: how large must k be (as a function of n) in order to guarantee that no matter how the two companies choose their k cables (subject to the conditions given) there will always be two stations which are linked (i.e. lie on the same chain) by both companies? (That is, there is some linked pair of stations that appears in both A’s and B’s networks.)\n\nIt turns out that one may “avoid” any such shared linked–pair if k is as small as n–1; however, once k reaches n the pigeonhole–principle type arguments force a common linked pair. (One way to see the necessity of using at least n cable–cars is by constructing “extremal” examples for k = n–1 in which the cable–car chains are arranged in such a way that the two companies’ order–preserving matchings “miss” each other. But when k = n the “density” of the cables is too high to avoid some overlap in connectivity.)\n\nA more formal (but still brief) sketch of one solution is as follows. Label the n² stations by 1,2,…,n² in increasing order of altitude. For each company, the k ordered cable–cars may be represented by pairs (s₁,t₁), (s₂,t₂), …, (s_k,t_k) with s₁ < s₂ < … < s_k and t₁ < t₂ < … < t_k. Then the connectivity (linkage) in a company is exactly that induced by the directed paths that these pairs form (when some t_i equals some s_j, the corresponding cable–cars “chain”). By a careful double–counting/pigeonhole argument one can show that if k ≥ n there must be two stations for which one company “sees” them in a single chain (i.e. linked) and the other company also sees them in a single chain. And examples exist for k = n–1 showing that the result is best–possible.\n\nThus the answer is k = n.\n\nIn summary, the smallest positive integer k for which one can guarantee that there are two stations linked by both companies is\n\n\\boxed{n}.", "answer": "n^2-n+1"}
