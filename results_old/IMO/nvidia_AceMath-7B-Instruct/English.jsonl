Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.", "response": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding the properties of the regular 2006-gon \\( P \\) and the definition of a good diagonal. A diagonal is good if its endpoints divide the boundary of \\( P \\) into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of \\( P \\). The sides of \\( P \\) are also considered good.\n\nFirst, we note that a regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices. When \\( P \\) is dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, we obtain 2004 triangles. We need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles that have two good sides.\n\nA side of the 2006-gon is always good, and a diagonal is good if it skips an even number of vertices. Therefore, a triangle with two good sides can either have two sides of the 2006-gon or one side of the 2006-gon and one good diagonal.\n\n### Case 1: Triangle with two sides of the 2006-gon\nIf a triangle has two sides of the 2006-gon, the third side must be a diagonal that skips an even number of vertices. This diagonal is good. However, such a triangle cannot be isosceles because the two sides of the 2006-gon are equal, and the third side (the diagonal) is different.\n\n### Case 2: Triangle with one side of the 2006-gon and one good diagonal\nIf a triangle has one side of the 2006-gon and one good diagonal, the third side must be another good diagonal. For the triangle to be isosceles, the two good diagonals must be equal in length. This means they must skip the same number of vertices.\n\nTo maximize the number of such isosceles triangles, we need to consider the symmetries of the 2006-gon. The 2006-gon has 2006 rotational symmetries. Each pair of vertices that are \\( k \\) vertices apart (where \\( k \\) is even) can form a good diagonal. For each vertex, there are \\( 1002 \\) such diagonals (since \\( 2006/2 = 1003 \\) and we exclude the vertex itself).\n\nHowever, each diagonal is counted twice (once from each endpoint), so there are \\( 2006 \\times 1002 / 2 = 1003002 \\) good diagonals. Each pair of equal good diagonals can form an isosceles triangle with a side of the 2006-gon. Since each diagonal can pair with \\( 2004 - 2 = 2002 \\) other diagonals (excluding itself and the diagonal directly opposite it), the maximum number of isosceles triangles is \\( 1003002 \\).\n\nHowever, we need to consider that each triangle is counted three times (once for each side of the 2006-gon), so the actual number of isosceles triangles is \\( 1003002 / 3 = 334334 \\).\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

A valley is a cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers, and an uphill path starts at a valley and consists of cells with increasing numbers.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the Nordic square. The smallest number, 1, must be a valley because it cannot be adjacent to any smaller number. Similarly, the largest number, \\( n^2 \\), cannot be a valley because it must be adjacent to at least one smaller number. Therefore, the number 1 is always a valley, and it starts an uphill path that ends at the largest number in its path.\n\nTo minimize the total number of uphill paths, we should try to maximize the length of each uphill path. The longest possible uphill path in an \\( n \\times n \\) Nordic square is \\( n^2 \\) cells, which would start at the smallest number and end at the largest number. However, this is not always possible because the path must follow the adjacency rule and the numbers must be in increasing order.\n\nThe key insight is that each number from 1 to \\( n^2 \\) must be part of exactly one uphill path. Since the number 1 is always a valley, it starts a unique uphill path. The next smallest number that is not part of any uphill path yet must also be a valley and start a new uphill path, and so on.

(Note that \\( \\gcd(x, y) \\) denotes the greatest common divisor of integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).)", "response": "To determine all pairs \\((a, b)\\) of positive integers for which there exist positive integers \\(g\\) and \\(N\\) such that\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = g\n\\]\nholds for all integers \\(n > N\\), we start by analyzing the expression \\(\\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a)\\).\n\nFirst, let's denote \\(d = \\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a)\\). This implies that \\(d\\) divides both \\(a^n + b\\) and \\(b^n + a\\). Therefore, \\(d\\) also divides any linear combination of these two expressions. Specifically, we can consider:\n\\[\nd \\mid (a^n + b) - a(b^n + a) = a^n + b - ab^n - a^2 = a^n - ab^n + b - a^2.\n\\]\nFor \\(n = 1\\), we have:\n\\[\nd \\mid (a + b) - a(b + a) = a + b - ab - a^2 = a + b - ab - a^2.\n\\]\nHowever, this does not provide much insight. Instead, let's consider the case when \\(n = 2\\):\n\\[\nd \\mid (a^2 + b) - a(b^2 + a) = a^2 + b - ab^2 - a^2 = b - ab^2 = b(1 - ab).\n\\]\nSimilarly, for \\(n = 2\\), we have:\n\\[\nd \\mid (b^2 + a) - b(a^2 + b) = b^2 + a - ba^2 - b^2 = a - ba^2 = a(1 - ba).\n\\]\nThus, \\(d\\) must divide both \\(b(1 - ab)\\) and \\(a(1 - ab)\\). Since \\(d\\) divides both \\(a(1 - ab)\\) and \\(b(1 - ab)\\), it must divide \\(\\gcd(a(1 - ab), b(1 - ab)) = (1 - ab)\\gcd(a, b)\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\(a = b\\). Then:\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^n + a, a^n + a) = a^n + a = a(a^{n-1} + 1).\n\\]\nFor \\(n > 1\\), \\(a(a^{n-1} + 1)\\) is not constant, so \\(g\\) cannot be a constant for all \\(n > N\\). Therefore, \\(a \\neq b\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the case when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime, i.e., \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\). Then \\(d\\) must divide \\(1 - ab\\). We need to check if \\(d\\) can be a constant for all \\(n > N\\). Let's assume \\(d = 1 - ab\\). Then:\n\\[\nd \\mid a^n + b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d \\mid b^n + a.\n\\]\nSince \\(d = 1 - ab\\), we have \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\). Therefore:\n\\[\na^n + b \\equiv a^n + ab \\equiv a(a^{n-1} + b) \\pmod{d}.\n\\]\nFor \\(d\\) to divide \\(a(a^{n-1} + b)\\) for all \\(n > N\\), \\(d\\) must divide \\(a\\) or \\(a^{n-1} + b\\). Since \\(d\\) is a constant and \\(a\\) is fixed, \\(d\\) must divide \\(a^{n-1} + b\\) for all \\(n > N\\). This is only possible if \\(d\\) divides \\(b\\). Similarly, \\(d\\) must divide \\(a\\). Therefore, \\(d\\) must divide \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\), which implies \\(d = 1\\).\n\nThus, the only pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the condition are those for which \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a, b) \\text{ such that } \\gcd(a, b) = 1}.\n\\]", "answer": "(1, 1)"}
