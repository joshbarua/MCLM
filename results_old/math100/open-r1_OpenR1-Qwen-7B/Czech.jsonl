The diagram shows a right angle at E, right? Because there's a right angle mark at E. The problem mentions that sin D is 0.7. Hmm, let me visualize this. Point F is the right angle, so DF and EF are the legs, and DE would be the hypotenuse? Wait, no. Wait, the points are labeled D, E, F. The right angle is at E, so the sides adjacent to E are the legs. Let me check the Asymptote code again. The Asymptote code says:\n\npair D,E,F;\nF = (0,0);\nD = (sqrt(51),7);\nE = (0,7);\ndraw(D--E--F--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(D,E,F,15));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",E,NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\",(E+F)/2,W);\n\nOkay, so F is at (0,0). E is at (0,7), which is 7 units up the y-axis. D is at (sqrt(51),7), so that's sqrt(51) units along the x-axis and 7 units up. So the triangle is D-E-F with right angle at E. So the sides are DE, EF, and DF. EF is 7 units because the label is at (E+F)/2 which is the midpoint between E(0,7) and F(0,0), so midpoint is (0,3.5), but the label says 7. Wait, maybe the length EF is 7? Because E is at (0,7) and F is at (0,0), so the distance between them is 7 units. Yes, that's correct. So EF = 7. Then DE is the horizontal side from D(sqrt(51),7) to E(0,7), so that length is sqrt(51) units. But wait, the problem says sin D = 0.7, so maybe I need to verify this. Wait, but if DE is sqrt(51), and DF is the hypotenuse, then sin D would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is EF/DF. Because angle D is at point D, so the sides adjacent to angle D are DE and DF? Wait, no. Let me think. In triangle DEF, right-angled at E. So angle at D is angle D. The sides adjacent to angle D would be DE and DF? Wait, no. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the angles are at the vertices. So angle D is at point D, which is one of the acute angles. The sides adjacent to angle D would be DE and something else? Wait, no. Let me recall: in a right-angled triangle, the two legs are adjacent to the right angle, and the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. The other two angles (acute angles) each have their own adjacent and opposite sides.\n\nSo angle D is at point D. The triangle is D-E-F with right angle at E. So angle D is between sides ED and FD. Therefore, in angle D, the sides adjacent would be ED and FD, and the hypotenuse is DF. Wait, but FD is one of the legs. Wait, maybe not. Let's clarify.\n\nIn triangle DEF, right-angled at E. So sides:\n\n- DE: from D to E, which is horizontal, length sqrt(51).\n\n- EF: from E to F, vertical, length 7.\n\n- DF: hypotenuse from D to F, which would be sqrt( (sqrt(51))^2 + 7^2 ) = sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. So DF is 10.\n\nSo angle D is at point D. The two sides forming angle D are ED and FD. So ED is adjacent to angle D, and FD is the hypotenuse. Wait, but FD is the hypotenuse? Wait, FD is the side opposite the right angle at E. Wait, no. Wait, hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at E, the hypotenuse is DF. So DF is the hypotenuse. Then, angle D is at D, so the sides adjacent to angle D are ED and FD? Wait, no. Wait, angle D is formed by the sides ED and FD. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn triangle DEF, angle at E is the right angle. So the sides adjacent to angle D (which is at D) are ED and DF? Wait, no. Wait, angle D is between which sides? Let's label the triangle properly. Points: D, E, F. Right angle at E. So the sides:\n\n- DE connects D to E.\n\n- EF connects E to F.\n\n- FD connects F to D.\n\nSo angle D is at vertex D, between sides ED and FD. Therefore, in angle D, the sides adjacent are ED and FD, and the side opposite is EF. Therefore, in triangle DEF, angle D has opposite side EF (length 7), adjacent side ED (length DE), and hypotenuse DF (length 10). Therefore, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF = 7 / 10 = 0.7. Which matches the given information. Therefore, DE is the adjacent side, which is ED. Since ED is sqrt(51), then DE is sqrt(51). Wait, but DE is from D to E, which is horizontal, so its length is sqrt(51). But the problem states sin D = 0.7, which is 7/10, so that checks out because EF is 7 and DF is 10. Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). So the answer is sqrt(51). But let me verify once again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"délka DE\". So DE is the side from D to E. From the coordinates given, D is at (sqrt(51),7) and E is at (0,7). So the distance between D and E is sqrt( (sqrt(51) - 0)^2 + (7 -7)^2 ) = sqrt(51 + 0) = sqrt(51). Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). So the answer is sqrt(51), which is approximately 7.1414, but since they want the exact value, it's sqrt(51). So boxed answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Since sin D = 0.7, which is 7/10, so in triangle DEF, angle D has opposite side EF =7, hypotenuse DF=10. Therefore, the adjacent side (DE) would be sqrt(10^2 -7^2)=sqrt(100-49)=sqrt(51). So yes, DE= sqrt(51). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(51).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of \\(DE\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}\\).\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle \\( \\triangle DEF \\) with a right angle at \\( E \\), we need to find the length of \\( DE \\).

Let me recall how complex number rotations work. \n\nFirst, in complex plane rotations, when you rotate a point around another point, you generally translate the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. Since the rotation is clockwise, the angle should be negative, right? So the rotation by θ radians clockwise is equivalent to multiplying by e^{-iθ}. \n\nGiven that z is (2 + sqrt(2)) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i and c is 2 - 3i. Let me write them in terms of coordinates to visualize. \n\nz has real part 2 + sqrt(2) and imaginary part -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)), so in coordinates, that's (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3 sqrt(2)). The center c is (2, -3). \n\nSo, first, I need to translate z by subtracting c. That is, compute z - c. Let's do that:\n\nReal part: (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2)\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) - (-3) = -3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3 = -3 sqrt(2)\n\nSo z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i\n\nNow, we need to rotate this translated point by -π/4 (since it's clockwise). The rotation factor is e^{-iπ/4} which is cos(π/4) - i sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo we multiply (sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i) by (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's denote the translated z as z_trans = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i.\n\nMultiplying z_trans by e^{-iπ/4}:\n\nz_rotated = z_trans * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2)\n\nFirst, multiply sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nThen sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = -i*(2)/2 = -i\n\nNext, -3 sqrt(2) i * sqrt(2)/2 = -3*(2)/2 i = -3i\n\nThen -3 sqrt(2) i * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 3*2/2 i^2 = 3*( -1 ) = -3\n\nSo adding all these together:\n\n1 - i - 3i -3 = (1 -3) + (-i -3i) = (-2) -4i\n\nSo the rotated translated point is -2 -4i.\n\nNow, translate back by adding c. So w = (-2 -4i) + c = (-2 -4i) + (2 -3i) = (-2 +2) + (-4i -3i) = 0 -7i\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, z - c: real part sqrt(2), imaginary part -3 sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nRotation: multiply by e^{-iπ/4} = sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Correct.\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) = 1, sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2) = -i. Then -3 sqrt(2) i * sqrt(2)/2 = -3*(2)/2 i = -3i. Then -3 sqrt(2) i * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 3*2/2 i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. So total is 1 -i -3i -3 = -2 -4i. Then adding c: 2 -3i. So -2 -4i +2 -3i = 0 -7i. So w = -7i.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me verify with another method. Maybe using coordinates.\n\nOriginal point z after translation is (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)). Rotating this by -45 degrees (clockwise). The rotation matrix for clockwise rotation is:\n\n[ cosθ   sinθ ]\n[ -sinθ  cosθ ]\n\nWhere θ = 45°, so cosθ = sinθ = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo the coordinates become:\n\nx' = sqrt(2) cosθ - (-3 sqrt(2)) sinθ\ny' = -sqrt(2) sinθ + (-3 sqrt(2)) cosθ\n\nWait, hold on. The rotation matrix for a point (x, y) rotated by angle φ clockwise is:\n\nx' = x cosφ + y sinφ\ny' = -x sinφ + y cosφ\n\nSo here, θ = 45°, so:\n\nx' = sqrt(2) * cos(45°) + (-3 sqrt(2)) * sin(45°)\ny' = -sqrt(2) * sin(45°) + (-3 sqrt(2)) * cos(45°)\n\nCompute cos(45°) and sin(45°) are both sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo x' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-3 sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2)\n= (2)/2 + (-3*2)/2\n= 1 - 3 = -2\n\ny' = -sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-3 sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2)\n= - (2)/2 + (-3*2)/2\n= -1 -3 = -4\n\nSo after rotation, the translated point is (-2, -4), which corresponds to the complex number -2 -4i. Then translating back by adding c = (2, -3). Wait, adding c (which is (2, -3)) to (-2, -4):\n\nx: -2 + 2 = 0\n\ny: -4 + (-3) = -7\n\nSo the final point is (0, -7), which corresponds to 0 -7i, so w = -7i. That matches the previous result. \n\nTherefore, w is -7i. Wait, but let me check if the rotation direction is correct. When the problem says \"rotated around c by π/4 clockwise\", so the rotation is clockwise. So the rotation matrix I used is correct. If it were counterclockwise, the angle would be positive. So yes, using -45 degrees is right. \n\nAlternatively, using complex numbers: multiplying by e^{-iθ} where θ is the rotation angle. So since θ = π/4, then e^{-iπ/4} = cos(π/4) - i sin(π/4) as I used. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be w = -7i, which in boxed form is \\boxed{-7i}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-7i}\n</think>\n\nTo find the complex number \\( w \\) which is the result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians clockwise, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\)**:\n   - Given \\( z = (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\),\n   - Translate \\( z \\) by \\( c \\): \\( z - c \\).\n   - Real part: \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\( (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) - (-3) = -3\\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - Result: \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\n2. **Rotate the translated point by \\( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) (clockwise)**:\n   - The rotation factor is \\( e^{-i\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) - i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n   - Multiply the translated point by this factor:\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i) \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Expanding the product:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (-i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) + (-3\\sqrt{2}i) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + (-3\\sqrt{2}i) \\cdot (-i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 1 - i - 3i - 3 = -2 - 4i\n     \\]\n\n3. **Translate back by adding \\( c \\)**:\n   - Add \\( c = 2 - 3i \\) to the rotated point:\n     \\[\n     (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = 0 - 7i\n     \\]\n\nThus, the complex number \\( w \\) is \\(\\boxed{-7i}\\).", "answer": "6 - 5i"}
{"original_question": "Zjednodušte $\\sqrt{242}$.", "question": "Zjednodušte $\\sqrt{242}$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the square root of 242. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when simplifying square roots, the goal is to factor the number under the root into a product of a perfect square and another integer. Then, I can take the square root of the perfect square part and leave the other part as is. \n\nFirst, let me recall what perfect squares are. They are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., which are squares of integers. So, I need to see if 242 can be broken down into one of these perfect squares multiplied by another number. \n\nLet's start by factoring 242. I know that 242 is an even number because it ends with a 2, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 242 by 2. \n\n242 ÷ 2 = 121. \n\nOkay, so 242 = 2 × 121. Now, 121 is a number I recognize. It's 11 squared, right? Because 11 × 11 = 121. So, that means 121 is a perfect square. \n\nSo, putting that together, 242 = 2 × 11². \n\nTherefore, the square root of 242 can be written as √(2 × 11²). \n\nNow, using the property of square roots that says √(a × b) = √a × √b, I can separate this into √2 × √11². \n\nSince √11² is just 11, because the square and the square root cancel each other out for non-negative numbers, this simplifies to 11 × √2. \n\nSo, √242 = 11√2. \n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I square 11√2, I should get back 242. Let's verify:\n\n(11√2)² = 11² × (√2)² = 121 × 2 = 242. \n\nYes, that works out. So, simplifying √242 gives me 11 times the square root of 2. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure there isn't a larger perfect square factor I might have missed. Let's factor 242 completely. \n\nStarting with 2: 242 ÷ 2 = 121. Then, 121 ÷ 2 is not an integer. Next prime number is 3, but 121 ÷ 3 is about 40.333, which isn't an integer. Then 5: 121 ÷ 5 is 24.2, not integer. 7: 121 ÷ 7 is approximately 17.285, nope. 11: 121 ÷ 11 = 11. So, 242 factors into 2 × 11 × 11. \n\nSo, the prime factorization of 242 is 2 × 11². There are no other prime factors. So, the largest perfect square factor is indeed 11². Therefore, simplifying √242 is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all the factors of 242 and see if any are perfect squares. Let's list them:\n\n1, 2, 11, 22, 121, 242. \n\nLooking at these factors, 1 is a perfect square (1²=1), and 121 is 11². So, the largest perfect square factor is 121. Therefore, we can write 242 as 121 × 2, which is the same as before. \n\nSo, using that method, we take the square root of 121, which is 11, and leave the 2 under the square root. Hence, √242 = 11√2. \n\nI think that's all. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\n1. Factor 242 into prime factors: 2 × 11 × 11.\n2. Identify the perfect squares: 11².\n3. Separate the perfect square from the remaining factor: 242 = 11² × 2.\n4. Apply the square root to each factor: √(11² × 2) = √11² × √2 = 11√2.\n\nYep, that seems solid. I don't see any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that 121 is a perfect square factor, and breaking down 242 into that. Since 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is a perfect square, that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, if someone isn't comfortable with prime factorization, they might try dividing by perfect squares step by step. Let's try that method as well to cross-verify. \n\nStarting with the largest perfect square less than 242. The perfect squares up to 242 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225. So the largest one less than 242 is 225. But 225 is 15². Let's see if 225 divides 242. 242 ÷ 225 is approximately 1.07, which is not an integer. So, 225 is not a factor. Next one is 196 (14²). 242 ÷ 196 ≈ 1.234, not an integer. Then 169 (13²). 242 ÷ 169 ≈ 1.438, nope. 144 (12²). 242 ÷ 144 ≈ 1.67, not integer. 121 (11²). 242 ÷ 121 = 2. So, exactly 2. So, 121 is a factor, and 242 = 121 × 2. Which is what we had before. \n\nSo, whether through prime factorization or testing the largest perfect squares, we arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, the simplified form of √242 is indeed 11√2. \n\nI think that's thorough. I considered different methods, checked my work, and verified the result by squaring the simplified expression. All steps lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{242}\\):\n\n1. **Factor 242 into prime factors**:\n   - \\(242 \\div 2 = 121\\)\n   - \\(121 = 11 \\times 11\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\).\n\n2. **Apply the square root to each factor**:\n   - \\(\\sqrt{242} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 11^2}\\)\n   - Using the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\):\n   - \\(\\sqrt{2 \\times 11^2} = \\sqrt{11^2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 11 \\times \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - \\((11\\sqrt{2})^2 = 11^2 \\times 2 = 121 \\times 2 = 242\\), which confirms the result.\n\nThe simplified form is \\(\\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}\\).", "answer": "11\\sqrt2"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when arranging people around a circular table, the number of arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But here, there's an added condition that three people need to sit together. So maybe I can treat those three as a single unit or \"block,\" which would reduce the number of units I need to arrange.\n\nIf Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting together, I can consider them as one block. Then, instead of arranging 8 individuals around the table, I'm effectively arranging this block plus the remaining 5 people. That makes a total of 6 units (the block plus 5 people). \n\nBut wait, since it's a circular table, arranging these 6 units would normally be (6-1)! = 5! ways. However, within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in different orders. There are 3! ways to arrange these three within their block. So I need to multiply the number of circular arrangements by 3!.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements should be 5! multiplied by 3!. Let me check if that makes sense. \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single block. That reduces the problem to arranging 6 items (the block + 5 others) around a circular table. The formula for circular permutations is (n-1)!, so here n=6, which gives 5!.\n\n2. Within the block, the three people can be arranged in 3! ways because the order matters. So we multiply 5! by 3!.\n\nCalculating that: 5! is 120, and 3! is 6. So 120 * 6 = 720. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 720.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternative approach: If there were no restrictions, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a circular table is (8-1)! = 7! = 5040. But since we have the restriction that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can fix their positions relative to each other.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the three people as a single entity. Then, as before, we have 6 entities to arrange around the table, which is (6-1)! = 5! = 120. Then, within the entity, there are 3! = 6 arrangements. So again, 120 * 6 = 720. That matches the previous result.\n\nWait, but is there a different way to think about circular permutations where some people must be grouped together? Let me recall. For linear arrangements, if you have a group that must be together, you treat them as a single unit and then multiply by the permutations within the group. For circular arrangements, it's similar, but the circular nature affects the total count because rotations are considered the same.\n\nBut in the case of circular arrangements, when you fix a group as a single unit, you still have to account for the circular permutations of the units. So treating the group as a single unit reduces the problem to (n-1)! where n is the number of units. Then multiply by the permutations within the group.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So in this case, 6 units (the trio plus 5 others) leading to 5! arrangements, multiplied by 3! for the trio's internal arrangements. So 5! * 3! = 120 * 6 = 720. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: Suppose all 8 people can sit freely, 7! = 5040. Now, how many of those arrangements have Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together? To compute that, we can use the principle of inclusion. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, think of fixing the trio's positions.\n\nWait, let's imagine fixing Pierre's position to account for the circular table. If we fix Pierre's seat, then the problem becomes arranging the remaining 7 people, but Rosa and Thomas must be next to Pierre. Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps fixing one person's position is a common technique in circular permutations. Let's try that.\n\nFix Pierre's position. Then, since the table is circular, we've eliminated the rotational symmetry. Now, we need to arrange the remaining 7 people, but Rosa and Thomas must be adjacent to Pierre. Since Pierre's position is fixed, Rosa and Thomas can be on either side of him. There are 2 choices for their arrangement: Rosa to the left and Thomas to the right, or vice versa.\n\nOnce Pierre's position is fixed, and his two neighbors are determined (Rosa and Thomas in some order), the remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 seats. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 is 5!.\n\nSo total arrangements would be 2 (for Rosa and Thomas) * 5! (for the others) = 2 * 120 = 240. Wait, but that's different from the previous answer of 720. What's going on here?\n\nHold on, this discrepancy makes me think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's see.\n\nIf I fix Pierre's position, then the seats adjacent to Pierre are fixed for Rosa and Thomas. But does the problem state that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all sit together? Yes. So if Pierre is fixed, then Rosa and Thomas must occupy the two seats next to Pierre. So there are 2 ways to arrange Rosa and Thomas around Pierre. Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 seats, which is 5! = 120. So total arrangements would be 2 * 120 = 240.\n\nBut according to the first method, treating them as a block gives 5! * 3! = 720. Which is different. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the first method is wrong because when you fix Pierre's position, you are already accounting for the circular symmetry, so maybe you don't need to multiply by 5! but instead consider the linear arrangement?\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. When you fix Pierre's position, you remove the need to consider rotations. So the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But if we require that Rosa and Thomas are adjacent to Pierre, then their positions are fixed relative to Pierre. So instead of 7! arrangements, we have only 2 * 5! arrangements.\n\nBut in the first method, treating them as a block, we have 6 units, which is (6-1)! = 5!, and then 3! arrangements within the block. So total 5! * 3! = 720.\n\nBut according to the second method, fixing Pierre's position, we get 2 * 5! = 240. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because when we fix Pierre's position, we are effectively creating a linear arrangement for the remaining seats, but in circular permutations, fixing one position already accounts for the circular nature. However, in the first method, treating the trio as a block and then permuting the blocks around the table, which is circular, so (6-1)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 720.\n\nBut in the second method, fixing Pierre's position, we get 2 * 5! = 240. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the second method. Let's see. If we fix Pierre's position, then the two seats adjacent to him must be occupied by Rosa and Thomas. However, in reality, the trio could be sitting anywhere around the table, not necessarily fixed to Pierre's position. So fixing Pierre's position might not be the right approach here because it restricts their seating unnecessarily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. Wait, if we fix Pierre's position, then we are indeed accounting for the circular permutations by fixing one point. So the total number of arrangements would be 2 * 5! = 240. However, this seems to ignore the fact that the trio could be seated in different positions around the table.\n\nWait, maybe the first method is correct. Let me think again. If we treat the trio as a block, then the number of circular permutations is (6-1)! = 120. Then, within the block, there are 3! = 6 arrangements. So total 120 * 6 = 720.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix Pierre's position, then the two seats next to him must be occupied by Rosa and Thomas. So there are 2 ways to arrange them. Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways. So total 2 * 120 = 240.\n\nBut these two results are different. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, but which one is right? Let's think of a smaller example. Suppose there are 3 people: Pierre, Rosa, Thomas. How many circular arrangements are there where all three sit together? Well, since it's a circular table with 3 people, the only arrangement is all three sitting in a circle, which can be rotated, so actually only 1 distinct arrangement. But if we treat them as a block, then it's 1! * 3! = 6. But since it's a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements should be 1. So clearly, that approach is wrong. Wait, so treating them as a block and calculating (n-1)! * 3! gives 6, but the actual number is 1. So that method is incorrect.\n\nWait, why is that? Because when you fix the block as a single unit, the number of circular permutations is (n-1)! where n is the number of units. Here, n=1 (the block), so (1-1)! = 0! = 1. Then multiplied by 3! = 6. But the actual number is 1. So clearly, this approach is not working.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach must be flawed. So what's the problem here?\n\nAh, maybe the problem is that when you have a block and consider circular permutations, you need to fix the position of the block relative to the table. But when the block is a single unit, you can rotate the entire table, so the block's position is relative. However, if the block is considered as a unit, then arranging it around the table (as a unit) would only give 0! = 1 way because there's only one unit. Then, multiplied by the internal arrangements (3!) gives 6, which is wrong.\n\nBut in reality, when all three are sitting together in a circle, there's only 1 distinct arrangement because rotating the entire group doesn't create a new arrangement. Wait, no. If you have three people sitting together in a circle, you can rotate the circle, but the relative positions are the same. However, if they are considered as a block, then the block can be placed anywhere around the table, but since the table is circular, all those positions are equivalent. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 1 (for the block) multiplied by the internal arrangements (3!) = 6. But in reality, there are 2 circular arrangements if you consider the direction—clockwise vs. counter-clockwise. Wait, but in circular permutations, usually, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same. So for three people sitting together, the only arrangement is the block, and the internal arrangements are 3! = 6. So why do we think it's 1?\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is arising because when all three are sitting together, the only thing that matters is their order relative to each other, which is 3! = 6. But in a circular table, if the entire block can be rotated, but since the block is treated as a single unit, rotating the block doesn't change the arrangement. Wait, no. If the block is considered as a single entity, then rotating the entire table would rotate the block as well, but since the block is a unit, the arrangement is fixed. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 1 (for the block) multiplied by 3! (internal arrangements) = 6. But if we have three people sitting together in a circle, the actual number of distinct seating arrangements is (3-1)! = 2, considering rotations. Wait, no, that's for arranging the three people around the table without any restrictions. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me clarify. For three people sitting around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (3-1)! = 2. Because rotations are considered the same, but the number of linear arrangements is 3! = 6, divided by 3 rotations, giving 2. But if all three are sitting together as a block, then treating them as a single unit, the number of circular arrangements is (1-1)! = 0! = 1, and multiplied by 3! = 6, giving 6. But that contradicts the previous result.\n\nSo which is correct? Let's list them. Suppose the three people are A, B, C. If they must sit together, then the possible arrangements are the two directions: A-B-C or C-B-A around the table. But if we consider them as a block, then the block can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, but since the block is sitting together, the direction around the block matters. However, in a circular table, the entire arrangement's direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) might not matter. Wait, but in circular permutations, usually, the direction does matter. For example, if you have people sitting around a table, sitting clockwise vs. counter-clockwise is different unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Dvě uspořádáná považována za stejná, pokud je jedno rotací druhého.\" Which translates to \"Two arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\" So rotations are considered the same. Therefore, in the case of three people sitting together, the number of distinct arrangements is 2: one for each direction. But if we treat them as a block, then arranging the block around the table (which is just one unit) can be rotated, but since it's a single unit, the number of arrangements is 1 (for the block's position) multiplied by 3! (internal arrangements) = 6. But according to circular permutation rules, since the block is a single unit, the number of arrangements is (1-1)! = 1, which would mean 1 * 6 = 6. However, in reality, there are only 2 distinct arrangements (clockwise and counter-clockwise). Therefore, this approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, so there's a problem with treating the trio as a block and using (n-1)! for circular permutations. The issue is that when the", "answer": "720"}

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(a = 10x^3\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n = 5\\). \n\nThe constant term would be the one where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero. So I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that when I take \\(a^{5 - k}\\) and multiply by \\(b^k\\), the exponents of \\(x\\) cancel out. Let me write that out.\n\nFirst, the exponent of \\(x\\) in \\(a^{5 - k}\\) is \\(3(5 - k)\\), because \\(a = 10x^3\\). Then, the exponent of \\(x\\) in \\(b^k\\) is \\(-2k\\), since \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\). So the total exponent of \\(x\\) in the term is \\(3(5 - k) - 2k\\). We need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n\\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 0\\)\n\nExpanding that:\n\n\\(15 - 3k - 2k = 0\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(15 - 5k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(-5k = -15\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nOkay, so when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero. That means the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\). Let me write that term out using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe general term is \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times (10x^3)^{5 - 3} \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). That's the combination of 5 things taken 3 at a time. I know that \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\\). So that's 10.\n\nNext, \\((10x^3)^{2}\\). Because \\(5 - 3 = 2\\). So that's \\(10^2 \\times (x^3)^2 = 100x^6\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\). Let's compute that. The negative sign will stay, and the denominator is \\(2^3 = 8\\), and the numerator is 1. The exponent on \\(x\\) will be \\( -2 \\times 3 = -6\\), so \\(x^{-6}\\). So this term is \\(-\\frac{1}{8x^6}\\).\n\nNow, multiply all these parts together:\n\nFirst, multiply the coefficients: \\(10 \\times 100 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\). Let's do that step by step.\n\n\\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\).\n\nThen, \\(1000 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -125\\).\n\nNow, the variables: \\(x^6 \\times x^{-6} = x^{6 - 6} = x^0 = 1\\). So the variables cancel out, leaving just the coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(-125\\). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the combination: \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\) is correct.\n\nThen, \\((10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6\\). That's right.\n\n\\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3 = (-1)^3 \\times \\frac{1}{2^3} \\times x^{-6} = -\\frac{1}{8}x^{-6}\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nMultiply all together: \\(10 \\times 100 \\times (-1/8) = 10 \\times (100 \\times -1/8) = 10 \\times (-12.5) = -125\\). Okay, that checks out.\n\nSo the constant term is \\(-125\\). Hmm, but wait, let me check if I considered the signs correctly. The term is \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\). The negative sign is raised to the third power, which is odd, so it becomes negative. So that's correct. The coefficient is negative. Then 1000 times negative 1/8 is indeed -125. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using the binomial expansion formula. Let me list all the terms just to confirm.\n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^5\\) has terms for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 5\\). So each term is \\(\\binom{5}{k} a^{5 - k} b^k\\). Let's compute each term's exponent of \\(x\\):\n\nFor each term, exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\\). So, to find when exponent is zero, 15 - 5k = 0 => k = 3. So only the term with k=3 is the constant term. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute all terms just to make sure.\n\nBut that would take time, but let's see:\n\nFor k=0: \\(\\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^5 (-1/(2x^2))^0 = 1 * 10^5 x^{15} * 1 = 100000 x^{15}\\). So exponent 15.\n\nk=1: \\(\\binom{5}{1} (10x^3)^4 (-1/(2x^2))^1 = 5 * 10^4 x^{12} * (-1/(2x^2)) = 5 * 10000 * (-1/2) x^{10} = -25000 x^{10}\\). Exponent 10.\n\nk=2: \\(\\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 (-1/(2x^2))^2 = 10 * 1000 x^9 * (1/(4x^4)) = 10 * 1000 * 1/4 x^{5} = 2500 x^5\\). Exponent 5.\n\nk=3: As before, \\(-125\\). Exponent 0.\n\nk=4: \\(\\binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^1 (-1/(2x^2))^4 = 5 * 10 x^3 * (1/(16x^8)) = 5*10*(1/16) x^{-5} = 50/16 x^{-5} = 25/8 x^{-5}\\). Exponent -5.\n\nk=5: \\(\\binom{5}{5} (10x^3)^0 (-1/(2x^2))^5 = 1 * 1 * (-1)^5/(32x^{10}) = -1/(32x^{10})\\). Exponent -10.\n\nSo indeed, only when k=3 do we get the exponent of x as 0, and the term is -125. Therefore, the constant term is -125.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made an error in the coefficient.\n\nFor k=3:\n\nCoefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{3} * (10)^{2} * (-1/2)^3\\).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n\\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\).\n\n\\(10^{2} = 100\\).\n\n\\((-1/2)^3 = -1/8\\).\n\nMultiply them all together: 10 * 100 * (-1/8) = 10 * (-12.5) = -125. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, all calculations check out. Therefore, the constant term is -125.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe constant term is \\boxed{-125}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\), we use the binomial theorem.

The problem says that if n ≡ 2 mod 7, find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, modular arithmetic. Alright, so n is congruent to 2 modulo 7. That means n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to substitute that directly. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me understand the expression: (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Since we need to find the remainder when this is divided by 7, maybe I can compute each term modulo 7 first and then multiply them together modulo 7. That should simplify things.\n\nGiven that n ≡ 2 mod 7, let's compute each term:\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 ≡ 8 mod 7\n\nBut 8 mod 7 is 1, right? Because 7*1=7, so 8-7=1. So n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nSo now, the product becomes 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.\n\nLet's compute that step by step. First, 4 * 6 = 24. Then 24 * 1 = 24. Now, 24 mod 7. Let's divide 24 by 7. 7*3=21, so 24-21=3. So 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. Therefore, the remainder should be 3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with n ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\nn + 2: 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn + 4: 2 + 4 = 6. Correct.\n\nn + 6: 2 + 6 = 8. 8 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 1. So 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 4 * 6 * 1. 4*6 is 24. 24 mod 7. 7*3=21, 24-21=3. So yes, 3. Therefore, the remainder is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see. Let me expand the expression first and see if that helps. But expanding three terms might be tedious, but let's try.\n\n(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Let's first multiply the first two terms:\n\n(n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8. Then multiply by (n + 6):\n\n= (n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n + 6n^2 + 36n + 48\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) + (8n + 36n) + 48\n\n= n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48\n\nBut perhaps expanding isn't necessary. Since we're working modulo 7, maybe we can reduce each coefficient modulo 7 early on.\n\nBut let's see. If n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48 ≡ ?\n\nFirst, let's compute each term:\n\nn ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nn^2 ≡ 2^2 = 4 mod 7\n\nn^3 ≡ 2^3 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 8 - 7 = 1)\n\n12n^2 ≡ 12 * 4 mod 7. 12 mod 7 is 5, so 5*4=20. 20 mod 7 is 6 (since 7*2=14, 20-14=6)\n\n44n ≡ 44 * 2 mod 7. 44 mod 7 is 2 (since 7*6=42, 44-42=2). So 2*2=4.\n\n48 mod 7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So 48 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\nn^3: 1\n\n12n^2: 6\n\n44n: 4\n\n48: 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 17. 17 mod 7 is 3 (since 7*2=14, 17-14=3). So same result, 3. So that confirms it.\n\nSo regardless of the method, the remainder is 3. Therefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me test with a specific value of n that is congruent to 2 mod 7. Let's pick n=2. Then (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8=192. Then 192 divided by 7: 7*27=189, 192-189=3. So remainder 3. Perfect. Let's try another value, n=9 (since 9≡2 mod7, 9-7=2). Then (9+2)(9+4)(9+6)=11*13*15. Let's compute that: 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Now divide 2145 by 7: 7*306=2142, 2145-2142=3. Again, remainder 3. So that works. So the answer is definitely 3.\n\nAnother way: Let me think if there's a smarter way, maybe using factorials or something? Not sure. But since the modulus is 7, and the terms in the product are n+2, n+4, n+6. If n ≡2 mod7, then n+2 ≡4, n+4≡6, n+6≡1 as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognizing that (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) can be rewritten in terms of (n - 5)(n - 3)(n - 1) since 2 ≡ -5, 4 ≡ -3, 6 ≡ -1 mod7. But not sure if that helps. Let's see:\n\n(n - 5)(n - 3)(n - 1).

The problem is about rotating a regular pentagon around its center clockwise, and we need to find the minimal number of degrees required so that it aligns back to its original position. Hmm, right, regular polygons have rotational symmetry. So, a regular pentagon should have rotational symmetry of order 5. That means if you rotate it by a certain angle, it will look the same as before. The angle should be 360 degrees divided by the number of sides, which in this case is 5. So, 360/5 equals 72 degrees. Therefore, rotating it by 72 degrees should bring it back to its original position. But wait, the question says \"minimal number of degrees,\" so is it 72 degrees? Let me double-check. If you rotate a regular pentagon by 72 degrees, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex. Since there are five vertices, after five such rotations, it would have completed a full 360-degree rotation. So yes, 72 degrees is the minimal angle needed. So the answer should be 72 degrees. Let me confirm with an example. Imagine a regular pentagon labeled with vertices A, B, C, D, E. If I rotate it 72 degrees clockwise, vertex A would move to where vertex B was, B to C, and so on. After one rotation, it's a different position, but after five rotations (which is 72*5=360 degrees), all vertices would have cycled through all positions, bringing it back to the original. Therefore, the minimal angle is indeed 72 degrees. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimal number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated clockwise around its center to align with its original position, we consider its rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it maps onto itself after a rotation of \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{5} \\). \n\nCalculating this angle:\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, rotating the pentagon by **72 degrees** clockwise will bring it back to its original configuration. This is the smallest angle that achieves this symmetry. \n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{72}", "answer": "72"}

The problem is about a trapezoid with coordinates (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) where x is greater than 7. We need to find the value of x + y. Hmm, trapezoid... right, a trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. So, first, I need to figure out which sides are parallel in this trapezoid.\n\nThe given points are three of the vertices, and the fourth is (x, y). Let me label the points for clarity. Let's say A is (5,3), B is (6,8), C is (7,4), and D is (x,y). Since it's a trapezoid, two sides must be parallel. The sides can be AB, BC, CD, or DA. But which ones?\n\nFirst, let's check the slopes between the given points. If any two sides have the same slope, they are parallel. Let's compute the slopes.\n\nSlope of AB: (8 - 3)/(6 - 5) = 5/1 = 5.\n\nSlope of BC: (4 - 8)/(7 - 6) = (-4)/1 = -4.\n\nSlope of CD: If we don't know D yet, we can't compute this.\n\nSlope of DA: (3 - y)/(5 - x).\n\nSo, possible pairs for parallel sides:\n\n1. AB and CD: Slopes 5 and something. If they are parallel, slope must be 5.\n\n2. BC and DA: Slopes -4 and (3 - y)/(5 - x). If they are parallel, then (3 - y)/(5 - x) = -4.\n\n3. Another possibility: AB and DA, but AB is slope 5, DA is (3 - y)/(5 - x). Unless they are the same line, but since it's a trapezoid, they can't be the same line.\n\nSimilarly, BC and CD: BC slope -4, CD slope unknown. Unless CD is also slope -4, but since we need only one pair of parallel sides, maybe.\n\nBut trapezoid only requires one pair of parallel sides. So depending on the configuration, different pairs might be parallel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trapezoid is defined by three points with the fourth determined such that two sides are parallel.\n\nWait, the problem states that the coordinates are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). So probably the trapezoid is formed by these four points in order, but the order isn't specified. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned as \"rovnoběžníku\" which is trapezoid, and the coordinates are given as four points. So maybe the trapezoid is formed by connecting these four points in some order? But the coordinates are given as (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). So perhaps the trapezoid is a quadrilateral with these four vertices, and we need to determine (x,y) such that it's a trapezoid with x >7.\n\nSo, the key is to figure out which sides are parallel. Let's consider different possibilities.\n\nCase 1: AB is parallel to CD.\n\nSo slope AB is 5, slope CD is (y - 4)/(x - 7). For them to be parallel, (y - 4)/(x - 7) = 5. So y = 5(x -7) +4 = 5x -35 +4 =5x -31. But we need to consider the other sides as well. For example, BC and DA must not be parallel. Let's check the slope of BC: (4 -8)/(7 -6)= -4/1= -4. The slope of DA is (3 - y)/(5 - x). If DA is not parallel to BC, then slope DA ≠ -4. But if CD is parallel to AB, then y =5x -31. Then slope DA would be (3 - (5x -31))/(5 -x) = (3 -5x +31)/(5 -x) = (34 -5x)/(5 -x). Let's compute that:\n\n(34 -5x)/(5 -x) = [ -5x +34 ] / [ -x +5 ] = [5x -34]/[x -5]. Hmm, not sure if that's equal to -4. Let's check:\n\nSet [5x -34]/[x -5] = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by (x -5):\n\n5x -34 = -4(x -5)\n\n5x -34 = -4x +20\n\n5x +4x = 20 +34\n\n9x =54\n\nx=6\n\nBut x=6, but the given point is x>7, so this is invalid. Therefore, if we assume AB is parallel to CD, then the slope of DA would only be -4 if x=6, which is not allowed. Hence, in this case, DA is not parallel to BC, so that's okay. Therefore, if AB is parallel to CD, then D is (x, 5x -31) with x>7.\n\nBut we need to check if the quadrilateral is a trapezoid. So if AB is parallel to CD, then the other sides may or may not be parallel. But since trapezoid only needs one pair of parallel sides, that's sufficient. However, we need to ensure that the points form a trapezoid. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BC is parallel to DA. So slope BC is -4, slope DA is (3 - y)/(5 -x). For them to be parallel, (3 - y)/(5 -x) = -4. Then, solving for y:\n\n3 - y = -4(5 -x)\n\n3 - y = -20 +4x\n\n-y = -20 +4x -3\n\n-y = -23 +4x\n\ny =23 -4x\n\nSo if BC is parallel to DA, then y=23 -4x. Then, we need to check the other sides. AB slope 5, CD slope (y -4)/(x -7). If x>7, then CD slope is ( (23 -4x) -4 )/(x -7) = (19 -4x)/(x -7). Let's see if AB is parallel to CD. AB slope is 5, CD slope is (19 -4x)/(x -7). Setting them equal:\n\n(19 -4x)/(x -7) =5\n\nMultiply both sides by (x -7):\n\n19 -4x =5(x -7)\n\n19 -4x =5x -35\n\n19 +35 =5x +4x\n\n54=9x\n\nx=6\n\nAgain, x=6, which is less than 7, so invalid. Hence, if BC is parallel to DA, then x=6, which is invalid. Therefore, in this case, BC and DA cannot be parallel if x>7.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe AB is parallel to BC? Wait, but AB slope is 5, BC slope is -4, which are different, so they can't be parallel. Similarly, BC slope -4, CD slope unknown. If CD is parallel to BC, then slope CD would be -4. So (y -4)/(x -7) = -4. Then y= -4(x -7) +4= -4x +28 +4= -4x +32. Then, slope DA would be (3 - y)/(5 -x) = (3 - (-4x +32))/(5 -x)= (3 +4x -32)/(5 -x)= (4x -29)/(5 -x). If DA is parallel to BC, then slope DA should be -4. So set (4x -29)/(5 -x)= -4.\n\nMultiply both sides by (5 -x):\n\n4x -29 = -4(5 -x)\n\n4x -29 = -20 +4x\n\nSubtract 4x from both sides:\n\n-29 = -20\n\nWhich is impossible. Hence, DA cannot be parallel to BC. Therefore, if CD is parallel to BC, then DA is not parallel to BC. Therefore, the only possible pair is AB parallel to CD or BC parallel to DA. But both of these lead to x=6, which is invalid. Therefore, maybe the trapezoid is not formed by consecutive sides, but perhaps the order of the points is different.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the trapezoid is not in the order A-B-C-D, but the points are connected in a different way. For example, maybe A-B-C-D is not the order of the trapezoid. The problem doesn't specify the order, so we have to consider different configurations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trapezoid is a different configuration where two non-consecutive sides are parallel. Wait, but in a trapezoid, the two parallel sides are called the bases, and the other two are legs. So regardless of the order, only one pair is parallel. So perhaps the given points are not in order. Let's think.\n\nGiven four points: (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), (x,y). Let's plot these mentally. Point A (5,3), B (6,8), C (7,4), D (x,y). If x>7, then D is to the right of C.\n\nSo, possible configurations:\n\n1. The trapezoid is A-B-C-D with AB and CD parallel.\n\n2. The trapezoid is B-C-D-A with BC and DA parallel.\n\n3. The trapezoid is A-C-B-D with AC and something parallel. Wait, but AC is a diagonal, not a side.\n\nWait, trapezoid is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So we need to check which pair of these sides are parallel.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\n- AB || CD\n\n- BC || DA\n\n- AD || BC (same as BC || AD)\n\nWait, but in a quadrilateral, only one pair of sides can be parallel. So either AB || CD, or BC || DA, or another pair.\n\nBut given the coordinates, let's compute the slopes again:\n\nAB: (5,3) to (6,8): slope 5.\n\nBC: (6,8) to (7,4): slope -4.\n\nCD: (7,4) to (x,y): slope (y -4)/(x -7).\n\nDA: (x,y) to (5,3): slope (3 - y)/(5 - x).\n\nSo, if we suppose that AB is parallel to CD, then slope AB = slope CD => 5 = (y -4)/(x -7) => y =5(x -7) +4 =5x -35 +4=5x -31.\n\nThen, we need to check if this configuration makes a trapezoid. So with AB parallel to CD, and the other sides BC and DA. Let's check if BC and DA are not parallel.\n\nSlope BC is -4, slope DA is (3 - y)/(5 -x). If DA is to be non-parallel to BC, then (3 - y)/(5 -x) ≠ -4.\n\nBut since y=5x -31, substitute into slope DA:\n\n(3 - (5x -31))/(5 -x) = (3 -5x +31)/(5 -x) = (34 -5x)/(5 -x) = [ -5x +34 ] / [ -x +5 ] = (5x -34)/(x -5)\n\nSet this equal to -4:\n\n(5x -34)/(x -5) = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by (x -5):\n\n5x -34 = -4x +20\n\n5x +4x =20 +34\n\n9x =54\n\nx=6\n\nBut x=6 is less than 7, which contradicts x>7. Therefore, in this case, if AB is parallel to CD, then DA would have slope -4 only when x=6, which is invalid. Therefore, DA is not parallel to BC, so the trapezoid is valid with AB || CD and DA not parallel to BC.\n\nAlternatively, if BC is parallel to DA. Then slope BC = slope DA => -4 = (3 - y)/(5 -x) => (3 - y) = -4(5 -x) => 3 - y = -20 +4x => y=23 -4x.\n\nThen, check if AB and CD are not parallel. Slope AB is 5, slope CD is (y -4)/(x -7) = (23 -4x -4)/(x -7) = (19 -4x)/(x -7). Set equal to 5:\n\n(19 -4x)/(x -7) =5\n\nMultiply both sides by (x -7):\n\n19 -4x =5x -35\n\n19 +35 =5x +4x\n\n54=9x\n\nx=6\n\nAgain, x=6, which is invalid. So if BC is parallel to DA, then x=6, which is not allowed. Therefore, BC cannot be parallel to DA if x>7.\n\nThird possibility: Maybe AD is parallel to BC. Wait, AD is the same as DA, just reversed. So if AD is parallel to BC, that's the same as BC || DA, which we already checked. So no.\n\nFourth possibility: AB parallel to BC? But AB slope 5, BC slope -4, which are different. Not parallel.\n\nFifth possibility: CD parallel to DA? CD slope (y-4)/(x-7), DA slope (3 - y)/(5 -x). If they are equal, then:\n\n(y -4)/(x -7) = (3 - y)/(5 -x)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(y -4)(5 -x) = (3 - y)(x -7)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 5y -xy -20 +4x\n\nRight side: 3x -21 -xy +7y\n\nSet left side equal to right side:\n\n5y -xy -20 +4x =3x -21 -xy +7y\n\nSimplify:\n\n5y -xy -20 +4x -3x +21 +xy -7y =0\n\n(5y -7y) + (-xy +xy) + (-20 +21) + (4x -3x) =0\n\n(-2y) +0 +1 +x=0\n\nSo:\n\nx -2y +1=0 => x=2y -1\n\nBut this is an equation relating x and y.

We need to find the vertical asymptotes \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\), and the horizontal asymptote \\( y = c \\), then compute \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes. From what I remember, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is zero, provided the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator and solve for x.\n\nThe denominator here is \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). Let me try to factor that. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7. 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\). Wait, let me check:\n\n\\( (x + 2)(x - 7) = x^2 -7x + 2x -14 = x^2 -5x -14 \\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the denominator factors to \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\). Therefore, the denominator is zero when \\( x = -2 \\) or \\( x = 7 \\). Now, I need to check if the numerator is also zero at these x-values. The numerator is 2x. At x = -2, numerator is 2*(-2) = -4 ≠ 0. At x = 7, numerator is 2*7 = 14 ≠ 0. So both points are vertical asymptotes. Therefore, vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, so a = -2 and b = 7. Hence, a + b = -2 + 7 = 5.\n\nNow, horizontal asymptote. For horizontal asymptotes, I recall that it depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 (since it's 2x), and the degree of the denominator is 2 (since it's x²). \n\nIf the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they are equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote but an oblique (slant) asymptote. Here, since denominator's degree (2) is higher than numerator's (1), the horizontal asymptote should be y = 0. Therefore, c = 0.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in factoring the denominator. Let me verify again. The denominator is x² -5x -14. Factoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Let's see, factors of -14: 1 and -14 (sum -13), 2 and -7 (sum -5). Yes, 2 and -7. So, (x + 2)(x - 7). Correct. So roots at x = -2 and x =7. So vertical asymptotes there. Since neither cancels with the numerator, which is 2x, correct.\n\nFor horizontal asymptote: since denominator's degree is higher, approaching zero as x approaches infinity. So yes, y=0. Therefore, c=0.\n\nThus, sum is -2 +7 +0=5. So the answer should be 5. Hmm, seems straightforward. I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\):\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) factors to \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n   - Setting the denominator equal to zero gives the solutions \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Since neither \\( x = -2 \\) nor \\( x = 7 \\) makes the numerator zero, these are the vertical asymptotes.\n   - Therefore, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:\n   - The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2).\n   - The horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]", "answer": "5"}
{"original_question": "Vypočítejte $99^2+99+1$ z hlavy.", "question": "Vypočítejte $99^2+99+1$ z hlavy.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate 99 squared plus 99 plus 1. Hmm, that seems a bit tedious with all those numbers, but maybe there's a trick to simplify it? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 99 squared is 99 times 99. Let me try to compute that. I remember that 100 squared is 10,000. Since 99 is one less than 100, maybe I can use that. So, (100 - 1) squared. That's a difference of squares. Let me recall the formula: (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2. Applying that here, a is 100 and b is 1.\n\nSo, 99 squared = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2*100*1 + 1^2 = 10,000 - 200 + 1 = 9,801. Okay, so 99 squared is 9,801. Then I need to add 99 to that. So, 9,801 + 99. Let me do that. 9,801 + 99. Hmm, 9,801 + 100 would be 9,901, but since it's 99, it's 9,901 - 1 = 9,900. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 9,801 + 99: 9,801 + 100 is 9,901, subtract 1 gives 9,900. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen add 1 to that result. So, 9,900 + 1 = 9,901. So, putting it all together: 99 squared is 9,801, plus 99 is 9,900, plus 1 is 9,901. Therefore, the answer is 9,901. But wait, let me verify that another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the expression. Let's see: 99^2 + 99 + 1. Hmm, can I factor this? Let's treat it as a quadratic in terms of 99. So, if I let x = 99, then the expression becomes x^2 + x + 1. Hmm, does that quadratic factor? Let me check the discriminant. Discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 1 - 4 = -3. Since it's negative, it doesn't factor over the real numbers. So maybe that approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognize a pattern. Let's see. 99^2 + 99 + 1. Let's see, 99^3 is 99*99*99. Wait, 99^3 can be written as 99*(99^2 + 99 + 1). Wait a minute, that's interesting. So, 99^3 = 99*(99^2 + 99 + 1). Therefore, 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^3 / 99. Which simplifies to 99^2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check. If 99^3 = 99*(99^2 + 99 + 1), then dividing both sides by 99 gives 99^2 = 99^2 + 99 + 1. Which would mean 0 = 99, which is not true. So, that approach is flawed. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me recall that a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So, if I have a^3 - b^3, that factors into (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). If I set b = 1, then a^3 - 1 = (a - 1)(a^2 + a + 1). Therefore, a^3 - 1 divided by (a - 1) is a^2 + a + 1. So, if I have 99^2 + 99 + 1, that's equal to (99^3 - 1)/(99 - 1). Let's check that. So, (99^3 - 1) divided by 98 equals 99^2 + 99 + 1. Therefore, 99^2 + 99 + 1 = (99^3 - 1)/98. Hmm, maybe that's another way to compute it. Let's see if that gives the same result.\n\nBut calculating 99^3 might be tedious, but perhaps manageable. Let me try. 99^3 is 99*99*99. First, compute 99*99, which we already know is 9,801. Then multiply by 99. So, 9,801*99. Let me compute that. 9,801*100 is 980,100. Subtract 9,801 to get 980,100 - 9,801 = 970,299. So, 99^3 is 970,299. Then subtract 1 gives 970,298. Divide by 98: 970,298 / 98. Let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 970,298 ÷ 2 = 485,149; 98 ÷ 2 = 49. So, now we have 485,149 / 49. Let's divide that. 49*9,800 = 480,200. Subtract that from 485,149: 485,149 - 480,200 = 4,949. Now, 49*100 = 4,900. Subtract that: 4,949 - 4,900 = 49. So, 49*1 = 49. So, total is 9,800 + 100 + 1 = 9,901. So, 970,298 divided by 98 is 9,901. Which matches the previous result. So, that confirms that 99^2 + 99 + 1 is indeed 9,901.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an even simpler way. Let's consider that 99 is 100 - 1. So, maybe rewrite the entire expression in terms of 100. Let's try that.\n\nSo, 99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1. Let's expand each term.\n\nFirst, (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2*100*1 + 1^2 = 10,000 - 200 + 1 = 9,801. Then, (100 - 1) is 99. Then, the last term is 1. So, adding them up: 9,801 + 99 + 1 = 9,901. Same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that 99^2 + 99 + 1 is similar to a geometric series. Let's see. A geometric series with ratio r = 99/99 = 1. Wait, no. If it's 99^2 + 99 + 1, that's 99^2 + 99 + 1. If I think of it as 99^2 + 99 + 1, which is like 1 + 99 + 99^2, which is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 99, but only three terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in this case, n would be 3, so (99^3 - 1)/(99 - 1), which is exactly the same as before. So, (99^3 - 1)/98 = 9,901. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nBut regardless of the method, the result is 9,901. Let me just verify once more by direct computation. 99 squared is 9,801. Then 9,801 + 99 is 9,900. Then 9,900 + 1 is 9,901. Yep, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with 9,901.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{9901}\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(99^2 + 99 + 1\\) mentally, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Compute \\(99^2\\):\n   \\[\n   99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 99 to the result:\n   \\[\n   9801 + 99 = 9900\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 1 to the result:\n   \\[\n   9900 + 1 = 9901\n   \\]\n\nWe can also verify this result using the identity \\(a^3 - 1 = (a - 1)(a^2 + a + 1)\\). Here, we recognize that:\n\\[\n99^2 + 99 + 1 = \\frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(99^3\\):\n\\[\n99^3 = 99 \\times 99 \\times 99 = 99 \\times 9801 = 970299\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1 and dividing by 98:\n\\[\n\\frac{970299 - 1}{98} = \\frac{970298}{98} = 9901\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9901}\n\\]", "answer": "9901"}

The matrix is [[2, 3], [0, -2]]. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that this is related to the concept of operator norms. The operator norm of a matrix induced by the Euclidean norm (which is the standard norm for vectors in R²) is the maximum value of ||A v|| / ||v|| as v ranges over all non-zero vectors. So, C should be the operator norm of the matrix A here. And the problem is asking for the smallest such C. So, essentially, I need to compute the operator norm of A.\n\nBut how do I compute that? I recall that for a matrix A, the operator norm is equal to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of A transpose times A. Let me verify that. Yeah, because ||A v||² = v^T A^T A v, so the maximum value of this over all unit vectors v is the largest eigenvalue of A^T A. Therefore, the operator norm is indeed the square root of the largest eigenvalue of A^T A.\n\nAlright, so let's compute A^T A. The given matrix A is:\n\n[2   3]\n[0  -2]\n\nSo, A transpose is:\n\n[2   0]\n[3  -2]\n\nMultiplying A transpose by A:\n\nFirst row of A^T times first column of A: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4\nFirst row of A^T times second column of A: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6\nSecond row of A^T times first column of A: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6\nSecond row of A^T times second column of A: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nSo, A^T A is:\n\n[4   6]\n[6  13]\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(A^T A - λ I) = 0.\n\nSo, the determinant of:\n\n[4 - λ   6      ]\n[6      13 - λ ]\n\nWhich is (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 6*6 = 0.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = 0\n\nFirst, expand (4 - λ)(13 - λ):\n\n= 4*13 - 4λ -13λ + λ²\n= 52 - 17λ + λ²\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n52 - 17λ + λ² - 36 = 16 - 17λ + λ² = 0\n\nSo, the quadratic equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0.\n\nLet me solve for λ:\n\nUsing quadratic formula: λ = [17 ± sqrt(17² - 4*1*16)] / 2\n= [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 2\n= [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 2\n= [17 ± 15] / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\n(17 + 15)/2 = 32/2 = 16\n\nand\n\n(17 -15)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of A^T A are 16 and 1. So, the largest eigenvalue is 16. Therefore, the operator norm is sqrt(16) = 4. Hence, C should be 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of A^T A, then yes, sqrt(16) is 4. But just to make sure, maybe I should verify this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the operator norm can also be computed as the maximum of ||A v|| over all vectors v with ||v|| = 1. So, perhaps we can parametrize v as [x; y], with x² + y² = 1, and compute ||A v||, then find its maximum.\n\nLet's try that. Let v = [x; y], unit vector. Then A v = [2x + 3y; -2y]. The norm squared is (2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(4x² + 12xy + 9y²) + 4y² = 4x² + 12xy + 13y².\n\nWe need to maximize 4x² + 12xy + 13y² subject to x² + y² = 1.\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem on a unit circle. To maximize this quadratic form, we can use Lagrange multipliers or note that the maximum is equal to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix corresponding to the quadratic form. Which again brings us back to A^T A.\n\nBut let's try using Lagrange multipliers. Let f(x, y) = 4x² + 12xy + 13y², and the constraint g(x, y) = x² + y² -1 =0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = f - λ g = 4x² + 12xy + 13y² - λ(x² + y² -1).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂x = 8x + 12y - 2λ x = 0\n\n∂L/∂y = 12x + 26y - 2λ y = 0\n\n∂L/∂λ = -(x² + y² -1) = 0\n\nSo, the first two equations:\n\n8x + 12y = 2λ x --> (8 - 2λ)x + 12y = 0\n\n12x + 26y = 2λ y --> 12x + (26 - 2λ)y = 0\n\nSo, we have a system of equations:\n\n(8 - 2λ)x + 12y = 0\n\n12x + (26 - 2λ)y = 0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions (x, y ≠ 0), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero:\n\n|8 - 2λ    12      |\n|12     26 - 2λ |  = 0\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\n(8 - 2λ)(26 - 2λ) - 12*12 = 0\n\nFirst, expand (8 - 2λ)(26 - 2λ):\n\n= 8*26 - 8*2λ -2λ*26 + 4λ²\n\n= 208 - 16λ -52λ +4λ²\n\n= 208 - 68λ +4λ²\n\nSubtract 144 (since 12*12=144):\n\n208 - 68λ +4λ² -144 = 64 -68λ +4λ² = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n16 -17λ +λ² =0\n\nWhich is the same quadratic as before: λ² -17λ +16=0, so λ=16 or 1. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(16)=4, as before. Therefore, the maximum of ||A v|| when ||v||=1 is 4, so the operator norm is 4. Therefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize the unit circle as x = cosθ, y = sinθ, and then express 4x² +12xy +13y² in terms of θ and find its maximum. Let's try that.\n\nExpress f(θ) = 4cos²θ +12cosθ sinθ +13sin²θ.\n\nWe can use double-angle identities. Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, note that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2, and sinθ cosθ = (sin2θ)/2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n4cos²θ = 4*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 2 + 2cos2θ\n\n12cosθ sinθ = 12*(sin2θ)/2 = 6 sin2θ\n\n13sin²θ = 13*(1 - cos2θ)/2 = 13/2 - (13/2)cos2θ\n\nSo, adding them all up:\n\n2 + 2cos2θ +6 sin2θ +13/2 -13/2 cos2θ\n\nCombine constants: 2 +13/2 = 17/2\n\nCombine cos2θ terms: 2cos2θ -13/2 cos2θ = (4/2 -13/2)cos2θ = (-9/2)cos2θ\n\nThen the sin2θ term: +6 sin2θ\n\nSo, f(θ) = 17/2 - (9/2)cos2θ +6 sin2θ\n\nTo find the maximum of this expression, we can consider it as a function of the form A + B cos2θ + C sin2θ. The maximum of such a function is A + sqrt(B² + C²). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, because B cos2θ + C sin2θ can be written as sqrt(B² + C²) cos(2θ - φ), where φ is some phase shift. Therefore, the maximum value is A + sqrt(B² + C²).\n\nIn our case, A = 17/2, B = -9/2, C =6. So, sqrt(B² + C²) = sqrt( (81/4) + 36 ) = sqrt(81/4 + 144/4) = sqrt(225/4)=15/2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of f(θ) is 17/2 +15/2=32/2=16. Therefore, the maximum of ||A v||² is 16, so the maximum of ||A v|| is sqrt(16)=4. Therefore, the operator norm is 4, confirming our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nBut just to make sure there's no mistake in the calculation, let's check with a specific vector. Suppose we take v such that A v has the maximum norm. For example, if we take the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 16 of A^T A. Let's find that eigenvector.\n\nFrom A^T A, we had eigenvalues 16 and 1. Let's find the eigenvector for 16.\n\nThe matrix A^T A -16 I is:\n\n[4 -16   6      ] = [-12   6]\n[6      13 -16 ]   [6   -3]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n-12x +6y=0 --> -12x +6y=0 --> 2x - y=0 --> y=2x\n\n6x -3y=0 --> 6x -3*(2x)=0 --> 6x -6x=0 --> 0=0\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1; 2]. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to 16 is [1; 2]. Therefore, the vector v=[1;2] is an eigenvector of A^T A with eigenvalue 16. Therefore, ||A v|| = sqrt(16) ||v|| =4 ||v||. So, if we take v=[1;2], then ||A v||=4||v||, which shows that C cannot be smaller than 4, since there exists a vector where the ratio is exactly 4. Therefore, the minimal C is indeed 4.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute A v for v=[1;2]:\n\nA v = [2*1 +3*2; 0*1 + (-2)*2] = [2 +6; 0 -4] = [8; -4]\n\nThe norm of this vector is sqrt(8² + (-4)^2)=sqrt(64 +16)=sqrt(80)=4*sqrt(5). The norm of v is sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So, 4*sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)=4. Therefore, equality holds here, which confirms that C=4 is indeed the operator norm.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that the minimal positive real number C is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest positive real number \\( C \\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive real number \\( C \\) such that for any two-dimensional vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the inequality\n\\[\n\\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| \\le C \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\n\\]\nholds, we need to compute the operator norm of the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThe operator norm of a matrix \\( A \\) induced by the Euclidean norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \\( A^T A \\). \n\nFirst, we compute \\( A^T A \\):\n\\[\nA^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nA^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 13 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the eigenvalues of \\( A^T A \\).

Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic exponent rules. I remember that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, but what about 1 raised to any power? Well, 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is still 1. So 1^anything should always be 1. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The exponent here is 2^235423523, which is a huge number. But regardless of how big the exponent is, if the base is 1, the result should still be 1. Let me check with some examples. \n\nFor instance, 1^1 is 1, 1^2 is 1, 1^3 is 1, and so on. Even if the exponent is a million, it's still 1. So even if the exponent is an astronomically large number like 2^235423523, which is like 2 raised to some massive power, the result should still be 1. \n\nBut maybe there's a trick in there? Sometimes math problems try to trip you up with something that seems complicated but has a simple answer. Let me think. If the base was 0, then 0 raised to any positive power is 0, but 0^0 is undefined. But here, the base is 1, so 1^anything is 1 regardless. \n\nAnother way to think about exponents: 1 multiplied by itself (which is 1) any number of times is still 1. So even if you multiply 1 by itself a billion times, you still get 1. So even an exponent as large as 2^235423523, which is like 2^23 billion, which is already an enormous number, doesn't matter. The base is 1, so the result is 1. \n\nIs there any mathematical principle that I might be forgetting here? Maybe something about the order of operations? But even if you parse it differently, 1^(2^235423523) is the same as (1^2)^235423523, which is 1^235423523, which is still 1. Alternatively, maybe using logarithms? But log(1) is 0, so 0 raised to any positive power is 0... Wait, but that doesn't apply here because it's 1 raised to a power, not 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe considering complex numbers? But 1 raised to any power in complex plane is still 1. Since 1 is a real number, and exponentiation with real numbers here is straightforward. \n\nSo, after all these considerations, I think the answer is 1. The exponent doesn't affect the result because the base is 1. So even the most complicated exponent, like 2^235423523, which is a tower of exponents, it doesn't matter. The result is still 1. \n\nI don't see any loopholes or special cases here. The properties of exponents tell us that the base's value is the key determinant of the result, especially for 1. Since 1 multiplied by itself any number of times remains 1, the answer must be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\) is determined by the base of the exponentiation.

The problem is about complex numbers. We have a complex number z such that z^5 = 1 and z is not equal to 1. We need to compute the expression z + 1/z + z² + 1/z².\n\nFirst, since z is a 5th root of unity and z ≠ 1, z must be a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation z^5 = 1. These roots can be represented in the complex plane as points on the unit circle spaced evenly every 72 degrees (since 360/5 = 72). So, z can be written in the form e^(2πik/5) where k is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since k=0 would give z=1, which is excluded).\n\nNow, the expression we need to compute is z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Let's see if we can simplify this expression. Since z is on the unit circle, 1/z is the complex conjugate of z. So, 1/z = z̄. Similarly, 1/z² = (z²)̄. Therefore, z + 1/z is equal to z + z̄, which is 2 times the real part of z. Similarly, z² + 1/z² is 2 times the real part of z². So, the entire expression becomes 2 Re(z) + 2 Re(z²). Therefore, the value we need is twice the sum of the real parts of z and z².\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express this using trigonometric identities. Let's denote θ = 2πk/5. Then z = e^(iθ) and z² = e^(i2θ). So, Re(z) = cosθ and Re(z²) = cos2θ. Therefore, the expression is 2(cosθ + cos2θ).\n\nSo, we need to compute 2(cosθ + cos2θ) where θ = 2πk/5 for k=1,2,3,4. But since cosine is even and periodic, cosθ = cos(2π - θ) and cos2θ = cos(4πk/5). However, since θ can be 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, or 8π/5, and cosine is even, cos(6π/5) = cos(4π/5) and cos(8π/5) = cos(2π/5). Therefore, the possible values of θ are 2π/5 and 4π/5. So, depending on the value of k, θ is either 2π/5 or 4π/5. But actually, since k can be 1,2,3,4, θ can be 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, or 8π/5. But 6π/5 is equivalent to -4π/5, and 8π/5 is equivalent to -2π/5. The cosine of these angles would be the same as their positive counterparts because cosine is even. Therefore, cos(6π/5) = cos(4π/5) and cos(8π/5) = cos(2π/5). So, the expression 2(cosθ + cos2θ) would be the same regardless of k, as long as k is 1,2,3,4. Wait, but let's check that.\n\nWait, if θ = 2π/5, then 2θ = 4π/5. If θ = 4π/5, then 2θ = 8π/5. But cos(8π/5) is equal to cos(2π - 2π/5) = cos(2π/5). Similarly, cos(4π/5) is equal to cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5). Wait, maybe I need to compute these values more carefully.\n\nLet me compute cosθ + cos2θ for θ = 2π/5 and θ = 4π/5.\n\nFirst, θ = 2π/5:\n\ncosθ = cos(72°), which is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2 ≈ 0.3090 * 2 = 0.6180? Wait, actually, cos(72°) is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 multiplied by 2? Wait, let me recall exact values.\n\nWe know that cos(72°) is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(72°) is equal to (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity for cos(72°):\n\ncos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's recall that cos(72°) = sin(18°), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, using the formula for cos(36°) and cos(72°).\n\nWe know that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * (1/2) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps I need to recall exact values.\n\nActually, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * (1/2). Wait, no. Let me check exact value.\n\nFrom the pentagon, we know that cos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2. Let me compute it numerically. cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, and (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 ≈ (2.236 - 1)/4 ≈ 1.236/4 ≈ 0.309, so yes, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2? Wait, (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 is approximately 0.309, so multiplied by 2 would be approximately 0.618, which is actually the value of cos(36°). Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, cos(36°) is approximately 0.8090, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Let's calculate (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809, so yes, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * 1/2 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps the exact value is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, but maybe a better way is to write cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Hmm, perhaps it's better to look up exact values.\n\nActually, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Wait, (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is approximately (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809, which matches. So, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * (1/2) * 2? Maybe I need to clarify.\n\nIn any case, perhaps it's better to use exact trigonometric identities. Let's try to compute cosθ + cos2θ where θ = 2π/5.\n\nFirst, θ = 2π/5, so 2θ = 4π/5.\n\ncos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5).\n\nWe can use the identity for sum of cosines: cosA + cosB = 2 cos((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2).\n\nSo, A = 2π/5, B = 4π/5.\n\nThen (A+B)/2 = (6π/5)/2 = 3π/5.\n\n(A - B)/2 = (-2π/5)/2 = -π/5.\n\nTherefore, cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5) = 2 cos(3π/5) cos(-π/5).\n\nBut cos(-π/5) = cos(π/5), so this becomes 2 cos(3π/5) cos(π/5).\n\nBut cos(3π/5) is equal to cos(π - 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5). Therefore, this becomes 2*(-cos(2π/5)) * cos(π/5) = -2 cos(2π/5) cos(π/5).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use specific values.\n\nWe know that cos(2π/5) is equal to (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2, but let's check.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in a regular pentagon, the diagonal over the side is the golden ratio φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. There are some trigonometric identities related to the golden ratio.\n\nAlternatively, we can use complex numbers. Since z^5 = 1, then z^5 - 1 = 0, so (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0. Since z ≠ 1, we have z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, the sum z + z² + z³ + z⁴ + 1 = 0, which implies z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1.\n\nBut our expression is z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Let's note that 1/z = z⁴, since z^5 = 1, so z⁴ = 1/z. Similarly, 1/z² = z³. Therefore, z + 1/z + z² + 1/z² = z + z⁴ + z² + z³.\n\nBut from the equation z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1, so z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. Therefore, our expression is equal to -1.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nGiven that z^5 = 1 and z ≠ 1, then z is a root of the polynomial z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0. Therefore, z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1.\n\nBut the expression we need is z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Since 1/z = z⁴ and 1/z² = z³, then z + 1/z + z² + 1/z² = z + z⁴ + z² + z³ = (z + z² + z³ + z⁴) = -1.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is -1. That seems too straightforward. Let me verify with a specific example.\n\nTake z = e^(2πi/5). Then 1/z = e^(-2πi/5) = e^(8πi/5) = z⁴. Similarly, 1/z² = e^(-4πi/5) = e^(6πi/5) = z³. So, z + 1/z + z² + 1/z² = z + z⁴ + z² + z³ = z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1, as per the equation. So, that works.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute numerically. Let’s take z = e^(2πi/5) ≈ cos(72°) + i sin(72°) ≈ 0.3090 + i 0.9511.\n\nThen 1/z = e^(-2πi/5) ≈ cos(72°) - i sin(72°) ≈ 0.3090 - i 0.9511.\n\nSimilarly, z² = e^(4πi/5) ≈ cos(144°) + i sin(144°) ≈ -0.8090 + i 0.5878.\n\n1/z² = e^(-4πi/5) ≈ cos(144°) - i sin(144°) ≈ -0.8090 - i 0.5878.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nz + 1/z ≈ (0.3090 + 0.3090) + i(0.9511 - 0.9511) ≈ 0.618 + 0i.\n\nz² + 1/z² ≈ (-0.8090 -0.8090) + i(0.5878 -0.5878) ≈ -1.618 + 0i.\n\nAdding these two results: 0.618 - 1.618 = -1. So, the total is -1. Therefore, the expression equals -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{-1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\( z \\) such that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we need to compute the expression \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\).\n\nFirst, note that \\( z \\) is a primitive 5th root of unity, meaning \\( z \\) satisfies the equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\).

The problem is 58_9 minus 18_9, and I have to give the answer in base 9. Hmm, let's see. I remember that subtraction in different bases is similar to subtraction in base 10, but I have to be careful with borrowing if needed. Let me start by writing down the numbers vertically to align the digits.\n\nFirst, let's convert both numbers to base 10 to check what we're dealing with. Maybe that will help me understand the subtraction better. \n\nStarting with 58_9. In base 10, that would be 5*9^1 + 8*9^0. So that's 5*9 + 8*1 = 45 + 8 = 53. Okay, so 58_9 is 53 in decimal.\n\nThen 18_9 in base 10 is 1*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 9 + 8 = 17. So 18_9 is 17 in decimal. \n\nNow subtracting them in base 10: 53 - 17 = 36. So the answer is 36 in decimal. But the question asks for the answer in base 9. So I need to convert 36 back to base 9.\n\nTo convert 36 to base 9, I can divide by 9 and see how many times it goes. Let's do that. \n\n36 divided by 9 is 4, with a remainder of 0. So the first digit (the rightmost) is 0, and the next digit is 4. So 36 in base 9 is 40_9. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If 40_9 is 4*9 + 0*1 = 36, yes that's correct. So 58_9 minus 18_9 equals 40_9. \n\nBut maybe I should do the subtraction directly in base 9 to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's try that method as well.\n\nSo, subtracting 18_9 from 58_9. Let's write it out:\n\n  5 8\n- 1 8\n-------\n  \nStarting from the rightmost digit: 8_9 minus 8_9. That's 0_9, so the rightmost digit is 0. \n\nThen the left digit: 5_9 minus 1_9. That's 4_9. So the result is 40_9. \n\nHmm, same answer. That gives me confidence. But wait, in base 9, when subtracting, do we have to worry about borrowing like in base 10? Let me check.\n\nIn the units place: 8_9 - 8_9 is straightforward, no problem. In the 9s place: 5_9 - 1_9 is also straightforward. Since 5 is greater than 1, we don't need to borrow. So the subtraction goes smoothly. If the lower digit was larger, we would have to borrow from the higher place, just like in base 10. For example, if it was 52_9 - 18_9, then in the units place 2_9 - 8_9 would require borrowing.\n\nBut in our case, the subtraction is 58_9 - 18_9, and both digits in the lower number are less than or equal to the corresponding digits in the upper number. So no borrowing is needed. Therefore, the result is indeed 40_9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by converting back to decimal. If I subtract 17 from 53, I get 36, which is 40_9. So that's consistent. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 40_9. Let me just write that in the required format. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of $58_9 - 18_9$ in base 9 is \\boxed{40_9}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) and express the result in base 9:\n\n1. Convert both numbers to base 10:\n   - \\(58_9\\) in base 10: \\(5 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 45 + 8 = 53\\)\n   - \\(18_9\\) in base 10: \\(1 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 9 + 8 = 17\\)\n\n2. Subtract the decimal equivalents: \\(53 - 17 = 36\\)\n\n3. Convert the result back to base 9:\n   - \\(36 \\div 9 = 4\\) with a remainder of 0, so \\(36\\) in base 9 is \\(40_9\\)\n\n4. Verify the subtraction directly in base 9:\n   - Subtract the units place: \\(8_9 - 8_9 = 0_9\\)\n   - Subtract the 9s place: \\(5_9 - 1_9 = 4_9\\)\n   - Result: \\(40_9\\)\n\nThus, the result of \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) in base 9 is \\(\\boxed{40_9}\\).", "answer": "40_9"}

I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Hmm, first, I remember that \\(\\sec x\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\cos x\\), so maybe I can rewrite that part. Let me try that.\n\nSo, \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). Therefore, substituting that into the first term, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Let me simplify the first fraction. Dividing by \\(\\sin x\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1/\\sin x\\), so that would give \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). So now the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\).\n\nHmm, both terms have a denominator of \\(\\cos x\\). Maybe I can factor that out? Let's see. If I factor out \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\), then the first term would be \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\) and the second term would be \\(-\\sin x\\). Wait, let me check that again. \n\nThe first term is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\). The second term is \\(-\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), which is \\(-\\sin x \\times \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). So factoring out \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) gives \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x \\right)\\). \n\nOkay, so now the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x \\right)\\). Let me work on the terms inside the parentheses. To combine \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x\\), I need a common denominator. The common denominator would be \\(\\sin x\\), right? So, rewriting \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x\\) as \\(\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\). \n\nWait, because \\(\\sin x\\) is the same as \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\). But I remember that \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\), so substituting that in, we have \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x}\\). \n\nTherefore, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\times \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x}\\). Multiplying those together, the \\(\\cos x\\) in the denominator cancels with one \\(\\cos x\\) in the numerator of the second fraction. So, \\(\\cos^2 x / \\cos x = \\cos x\\). Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\) is the definition of cotangent, so that's \\(\\cot x\\). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting over: \\(\\sec x / \\sin x - \\sin x / \\cos x\\). Replace \\(\\sec x\\) with \\(1/\\cos x\\), so \\(1/(\\cos x \\sin x) - \\sin x / \\cos x\\). Combine terms by factoring out \\(1/\\cos x\\), leading to \\(1/\\cos x (1/\\sin x - \\sin x)\\). Then, common denominator for \\(1/\\sin x - \\sin x\\) is \\(\\sin x\\), so numerator \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\). Then, multiply by \\(1/\\cos x\\), giving \\(\\cos x / \\sin x = \\cot x\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a common denominator for the original expression without factoring. Let's try that approach too to verify. The original expression is \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Let's write both terms with denominators involving \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) maybe? \n\nThe first term is \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x}\\). To get a common denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\cos x\\): \\(\\frac{\\sec x \\cos x}{\\sin x \\cos x}\\). But \\(\\sec x \\cos x = (1/\\cos x) \\times \\cos x = 1\\), so the first term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x \\cos x}\\). \n\nThe second term is \\(-\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). To get the same denominator \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\), multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sin x\\): \\(-\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin x \\cos x}\\). \n\nSo now, the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x \\cos x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin x \\cos x}\\). Combining the numerators: \\(1 - \\sin^2 x\\), over the common denominator \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\). Then, \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\), so we have \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x \\cos x}\\). Simplify by canceling one \\(\\cos x\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\\). \n\nSame result. Okay, so that confirms it. Therefore, the simplified expression is \\(\\cot x\\). \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check with a sample value. Let's take \\(x = \\pi/4\\). Then, \\(\\sec(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\\), \\(\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\\), \\(\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\\). \n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}/2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2}\\). Simplify first term: \\(\\sqrt{2} \\div (\\sqrt{2}/2) = \\sqrt{2} \\times 2/\\sqrt{2} = 2\\). Second term: \\((\\sqrt{2}/2) \\div (\\sqrt{2}/2) = 1\\). So, the expression is \\(2 - 1 = 1\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\cot(\\pi/4) = 1\\), which matches. So that works. Let's try another angle, say \\(x = \\pi/6\\). \n\nCompute original expression: \\(\\sec(\\pi/6)/\\sin(\\pi/6) - \\sin(\\pi/6)/\\cos(\\pi/6)\\). \n\n\\(\\sec(\\pi/6) = 2/\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\sin(\\pi/6) = 1/2\\), \\(\\cos(\\pi/6) = \\sqrt{3}/2\\).\n\nFirst term: \\((2/\\sqrt{3}) / (1/2) = (2/\\sqrt{3}) \\times 2 = 4/\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nSecond term: \\((1/2) / (\\sqrt{3}/2) = (1/2) \\times (2/\\sqrt{3}) = 1/\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nSo, the expression is \\(4/\\sqrt{3} - 1/\\sqrt{3} = 3/\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\cot(\\pi/6) = \\cos(\\pi/6)/\\sin(\\pi/6) = (\\sqrt{3}/2)/(1/2) = \\sqrt{3}\\), which matches.

Kombinovaná váha kolika treeků se rovná váze jednoho squiga?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many treeků are equivalent in weight to one squig. The problem gives me some relationships between the weights of treeků, squigové, and goolee. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states: \"Deset treeků váží stejně jako tři squigové a один goolee.\" Translating that from Czech, it should be \"Ten treeků weigh the same as three squigové and one goolee.\" So, 10 treeků = 3 squigové + 1 goolee. Got that equation.\n\nThen it says: \"Dva treekové a один goolee mají stejnou váhu jako один squig.\" Translating: \"Two treekové and one goolee have the same weight as one squig.\" So, 2 treeků + 1 goolee = 1 squig. Okay, that's another equation.\n\nThe question is: \"Kombinovaná váha kolika treeků se rovná váze jednoho squiga?\" Which translates to \"The combined weight of how many treeků equals the weight of one squig?\" So, we need to find the number of treeků (let's call that x) such that x treeků = 1 squig.\n\nAlright, let's assign variables to each type to make it easier. Let me denote:\n\n- Let T be the weight of one treeký.\n- Let S be the weight of one squigové.\n- Let G be the weight of one goolee.\n\nNow, translating the given equations into algebraic expressions:\n\n1. 10T = 3S + G  (Ten treeků weigh the same as three squigové and one goolee)\n2. 2T + G = S     (Two treeků and one goolee weigh the same as one squig)\n\nWe need to find x such that xT = S.\n\nSo, the goal is to express S in terms of T. To do that, maybe we can use the two equations to eliminate G and solve for S and T.\n\nStarting with equation 2: 2T + G = S. Let's solve for G here. Subtract 2T from both sides:\n\nG = S - 2T.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for G into equation 1. So equation 1 becomes:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n10T = 3S + S - 2T\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nNow, add 2T to both sides to get all T terms on the left:\n\n10T + 2T = 4S\n12T = 4S\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nSo, S = 3T. That means one squig is equivalent in weight to three treeků. Therefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify with the original equations.\n\nIf S = 3T, then let's substitute back into equation 2: 2T + G = S = 3T. Therefore, G = 3T - 2T = T. So, G = T.\n\nNow, check equation 1: 10T = 3S + G. Substitute S = 3T and G = T:\n\n10T = 3*(3T) + T\n10T = 9T + T\n10T = 10T\n\nYes, that checks out. So both equations are satisfied when S = 3T and G = T. Therefore, one squig is indeed equal in weight to three treeků. So the answer is 3.\n\nBut wait, let me just think again. Sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, it's easy to make a substitution error. Let me go through the steps once more.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. 10T = 3S + G\n2. 2T + G = S\n\nFrom equation 2: G = S - 2T\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n10T = 4S - 2T\n12T = 4S\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nYes, that's correct. So S is three times T. Therefore, one squig equals three treeků. So the answer is 3 treeků. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express everything in terms of S, but the question asks for how many treeků equal one squig, so S is in terms of T. We found S = 3T, so xT = S => x = 3. Yep.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in the substitution steps, and the verification with substitution checks out. So I'm confident the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe combined weight of \\boxed{3} treeků equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to determine how many treeků (T) weigh the same as one squig (S).

The problem says that the product of two quadratic polynomials, 3t² + 5t + a and 4t² + bt - 2, is equal to 12t⁴ + 26t³ - 8t² - 16t + 6. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial. So maybe I can expand the product (3t² + 5t + a)(4t² + bt - 2) and then compare the coefficients with the given polynomial 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6. That should give me equations to solve for a and b, and then I can add them together.\n\nLet me start by expanding the product step by step. Let's write down the multiplication:\n\n(3t²)(4t²) + (3t²)(bt) + (3t²)(-2) + (5t)(4t²) + (5t)(bt) + (5t)(-2) + (a)(4t²) + (a)(bt) + (a)(-2)\n\nOkay, let me compute each term one by one.\n\nFirst term: 3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴\n\nSecond term: 3t² * bt = 3b t³\n\nThird term: 3t² * (-2) = -6t²\n\nFourth term: 5t * 4t² = 20t³\n\nFifth term: 5t * bt = 5b t²\n\nSixth term: 5t * (-2) = -10t\n\nSeventh term: a * 4t² = 4a t²\n\nEighth term: a * bt = ab t\n\nNinth term: a * (-2) = -2a\n\nNow, let me combine all these terms together:\n\n12t⁴ + 3b t³ - 6t² + 20t³ + 5b t² -10t + 4a t² + ab t -2a\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. Let's group terms by the power of t:\n\n- The t⁴ term: 12t⁴\n\n- The t³ terms: 3b t³ + 20t³ = (3b + 20) t³\n\n- The t² terms: -6t² + 5b t² + 4a t² = (-6 + 5b + 4a) t²\n\n- The t terms: -10t + ab t = (-10 + ab) t\n\n- The constant term: -2a\n\nSo putting it all together, the expanded polynomial is:\n\n12t⁴ + (3b + 20) t³ + (-6 + 5b + 4a) t² + (-10 + ab) t -2a\n\nNow, we know that this should be equal to the given polynomial:\n\n12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers of t must be equal. Let's set up equations for each coefficient.\n\nStarting with the highest degree term, t⁴:\n\n12t⁴ = 12t⁴. So that's already matching. Good.\n\nNext, t³ term:\n\n(3b + 20) t³ = 26 t³\n\nTherefore, 3b + 20 = 26. Let's solve for b:\n\n3b = 26 -20\n\n3b = 6\n\nb = 6 / 3\n\nb = 2\n\nOkay, so b is 2. Let me note that down: b = 2.\n\nNow, moving to the t² term:\n\n(-6 + 5b + 4a) t² = -8 t²\n\nSo, -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\nWe already found that b = 2, so substitute that in:\n\n-6 + 5*(2) + 4a = -8\n\nCompute 5*2 = 10:\n\n-6 + 10 + 4a = -8\n\nSimplify -6 +10 = 4:\n\n4 + 4a = -8\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n4a = -8 -4\n\n4a = -12\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na = -12 /4\n\na = -3\n\nSo a is -3. Alright, so now we have a = -3 and b = 2. The question asks for a + b. So that's -3 + 2 = -1.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check the other coefficients to make sure everything is correct. Sometimes, even if the higher degree terms match, the lower ones might have discrepancies. Let me check the t term and the constant term.\n\nt term:\n\n(-10 + ab) t = -16 t\n\nSo, -10 + ab = -16\n\nWe know a = -3 and b =2, so compute ab:\n\nab = (-3)(2) = -6\n\nThen, -10 + (-6) = -16, which matches. Good.\n\nConstant term:\n\n-2a = 6\n\nSo, -2a =6\n\nSolve for a:\n\na = 6 / (-2) = -3\n\nWhich matches our previous result. Perfect. All coefficients check out.\n\nTherefore, a is -3 and b is 2, so a + b = -3 +2 = -1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the constant term. The original constant term after expansion is -2a, and the given constant term is 6. So:\n\n-2a =6\n\n=> a = -3, which is correct. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, all equations are satisfied, so a = -3, b=2, so a + b = -1. So the answer should be \\boxed{-1}\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b\\) is \\boxed{-1}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(a + b\\), we start by expanding the product of the polynomials \\(3t^2 + 5t + a\\) and \\(4t^2 + bt - 2\\):\n\n\\[\n(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term, we get:\n\n\\[\n12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n\\[\n12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(t\\), we get the following equations:\n\n1. For \\(t^3\\) term: \\(3b + 20 = 26\\)\n   \\[\n   3b = 6 \\implies b = 2\n   \\]\n\n2.

So, we have a piecewise function f(x) defined as follows: \n\n- For x ≥ a, f(x) = a x²\n- For x < a, f(x) = a x + 2a\n\nAnd we need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every vertical line at least once. Hmm, that means that for every real number k, there should be some x where f(x) = k. In other words, the function must be surjective onto the real numbers. So, the function needs to cover all real numbers as its outputs. \n\nFirst, let me recall that a function is surjective if for every real number y, there exists some x such that f(x) = y. So, we need to ensure that no matter what y we pick, there's an x that maps to it. \n\nGiven that f(x) is piecewise-defined, we need to check both pieces and make sure that together they cover all real numbers. Let's analyze each piece separately and then see how they interact.\n\nStarting with the first piece: f(x) = a x² for x ≥ a. The domain here is x ≥ a, which means that the inputs to this quadratic function are restricted to x values starting from a onwards. The quadratic function a x² will depend on the value of a. If a is positive, then as x increases, the quadratic term will dominate and go to infinity. If a is negative, then the quadratic term will open downward, but since x is being squared, the output will still be non-negative if a is negative. Wait, but if a is negative, then a x² is negative times a square, so it's non-positive. Hmm, but x is ≥ a. If a is negative, x starts from a (which is negative) and goes to infinity. So, x² is always non-negative, so a x² would be non-positive if a is negative. \n\nWait, but the quadratic term for x ≥ a. Let's consider different cases for a.\n\nCase 1: a > 0.\n\nIn this case, for x ≥ a, the function f(x) = a x² is a standard upward-opening parabola scaled by a. Since x starts at a and goes to infinity, the minimum value of this piece is at x = a: f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. As x increases beyond a, the function increases to infinity. So, the range of this piece is [a³, ∞).\n\nFor the second piece: f(x) = a x + 2a for x < a. Since x < a, and a is positive, x can go from negative infinity up to a. The function is linear here. The slope is a, which is positive, so as x increases towards a, the function increases. The minimum value of this piece would be as x approaches a from the left: lim_{x→a^-} f(x) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. And as x approaches negative infinity, the function f(x) = a x + 2a approaches negative infinity. So, the range of this piece is (-∞, a² + 2a).\n\nNow, to have the entire function surjective, the union of the ranges of both pieces must cover all real numbers. Let's see:\n\nThe first piece covers [a³, ∞), and the second piece covers (-∞, a² + 2a). For their union to cover all real numbers, the upper bound of the first piece (a³) must be less than or equal to the lower bound of the second piece (a² + 2a). Wait, no, actually, the union of (-∞, a² + 2a) and [a³, ∞) would cover all real numbers if a² + 2a ≥ a³. Because then, the upper part up to a² + 2a is covered by the second piece, and from a³ onwards by the first piece. But wait, but if a³ < a² + 2a, then there is a gap between a³ and a² + 2a. So, to have the union cover all real numbers, we need that a² + 2a ≥ a³. That way, the two ranges overlap or at least meet, so there's no gap.\n\nSo, the condition would be a³ ≤ a² + 2a. Let's write that inequality:\n\na³ ≤ a² + 2a\n\nSubtracting a³ from both sides:\n\n0 ≤ -a³ + a² + 2a\n\nFactor out a:\n\n0 ≤ a(-a² + a + 2)\n\nSo, 0 ≤ a(-a² + a + 2)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na(-a² + a + 2) ≥ 0\n\nLet's analyze the expression. First, note that if a is positive, then the sign of the expression depends on (-a² + a + 2). Let's factor the quadratic in the parentheses:\n\n-a² + a + 2 = - (a² - a - 2) = - (a - 2)(a + 1)\n\nSo, - (a - 2)(a + 1) ≥ 0 when (a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0.\n\nSo, solving (a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0:\n\nThe roots are a = -1 and a = 2. The quadratic opens upwards, so the expression is ≤ 0 between the roots. Thus, for a in [-1, 2], the expression is ≤ 0. But in our case, a is positive (since we considered a > 0 in Case 1). So, combining with a > 0, the inequality holds when a ∈ (0, 2].\n\nBut wait, the original inequality after factoring was a(-a² + a + 2) ≥ 0. If a is positive, then the sign of the entire expression is the same as the sign of (-a² + a + 2). Which is equivalent to (a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0. So, for a > 0, the expression is non-negative when a ∈ (0, 2].\n\nTherefore, the condition a³ ≤ a² + 2a holds when a ∈ (0, 2].\n\nBut we need to check if this is sufficient. Let me verify.\n\nIf a is in (0, 2], then the second piece's range is (-∞, a² + 2a) and the first piece's range is [a³, ∞). So, the union is (-∞, ∞) only if a³ ≤ a² + 2a. If a³ ≤ a² + 2a, then the upper bound of the first piece is at least as large as the lower bound of the second piece. Wait, actually, the first piece starts at a³ and goes up, and the second piece goes up to a² + 2a. So, if a³ ≤ a² + 2a, then there is no gap between the two ranges. So, for example, if a³ = a² + 2a, then the two ranges meet at that point. If a³ < a² + 2a, then there's a gap between a³ and a² + 2a. Wait, no. Wait, the first piece starts at a³ and goes to infinity, the second piece goes up to a² + 2a. So, if a³ ≤ a² + 2a, then the first piece's start is below or equal to the second piece's end. Therefore, the union of the two ranges would be (-∞, ∞). If a³ > a² + 2a, then the first piece starts higher than the second piece ends, leaving a gap between a² + 2a and a³. Therefore, to cover all real numbers, we must have a³ ≤ a² + 2a, which as we saw holds when a ∈ (0, 2].\n\nBut we also need to check that there's no overlap between the two pieces. Wait, but for x ≥ a and x < a, the two pieces are defined on disjoint domains, so there's no overlap. Therefore, the ranges are separate except at the point x = a, where the function is defined by the first piece. However, since the second piece approaches the value at x = a from the left, we need to check continuity at x = a. Wait, but the problem doesn't require continuity. So even if there's a jump discontinuity, as long as every real number is covered by either piece, it's okay.\n\nWait, but the problem is about surjectivity, not continuity. So even if the function has a jump, as long as every real number is achieved by either piece, it's fine. So, for example, if the first piece starts at a³ and goes to infinity, and the second piece goes up to a² + 2a, then if a³ ≤ a² + 2a, the union of the ranges is all real numbers. Because the second piece covers everything up to a² + 2a, and the first piece covers everything from a³ onwards. Since a³ ≤ a² + 2a, the two ranges overlap or meet, so together they cover all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the case where a > 0, the necessary and sufficient condition is a ∈ (0, 2].\n\nNow, let's consider the case when a = 0. If a = 0, then the function becomes:\n\nFor x ≥ 0, f(x) = 0 * x² = 0.\n\nFor x < 0, f(x) = 0 * x + 2 * 0 = 0.\n\nSo, f(x) = 0 for all x. Then, the range is just {0}, which does not cover all real numbers. Therefore, a = 0 is invalid.\n\nNext, consider a < 0. Let's analyze this case.\n\nCase 2: a < 0.\n\nFor the first piece: f(x) = a x² for x ≥ a. Since a is negative and x ≥ a (which is a negative number), x can range from a to infinity. However, x² is always non-negative, so a x² is non-positive (because a is negative). Therefore, the range of the first piece is a * [a², ∞) since x² ≥ a² (because x ≥ a, and squaring a number less than or equal to a in absolute value would give x² ≥ a² if a is negative). Wait, actually, let's think carefully.\n\nIf a is negative, say a = -k where k > 0, then x ≥ a means x ≥ -k. So x is in [-k, ∞). Then x² is in [0, ∞), so a x² = -k x². Therefore, the range of the first piece is (-k)([0, ∞)) = (-∞, 0]. So, regardless of a being negative, the first piece will have a range of (-∞, 0].\n\nFor the second piece: f(x) = a x + 2a for x < a. Since a is negative, x < a means x is less than a (a negative number). The function is linear with slope a (negative) and intercept 2a (also negative). Let's analyze its range.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, the term a x dominates, so since a is negative and x is approaching negative infinity, a x approaches positive infinity. Therefore, as x → -∞, f(x) → +∞. At x = a (but x < a here), approaching a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. But since a is negative, a² is positive, 2a is negative. So, a² + 2a = a(a + 2). Since a is negative, if a + 2 is positive or negative.\n\nWait, let's compute a(a + 2). Since a < 0, and a + 2 could be positive or negative depending on the value of a. For example, if a = -1, then a + 2 = 1, so a(a + 2) = -1*1 = -1. If a = -3, then a + 2 = -1, so a(a + 2) = -3*(-1) = 3.\n\nSo, depending on the value of a, a(a + 2) can be positive or negative.\n\nBut in any case, since x < a, and a is negative, x is going to negative infinity. So, the function f(x) = a x + 2a is decreasing (since slope a is negative) from +∞ to a(a + 2). Therefore, the range of the second piece is (a(a + 2), ∞). Wait, no. Wait, when x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches +∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a(a + 2). Since the function is decreasing, the range is (a(a + 2), ∞). Wait, no. Wait, if x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches +∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a(a + 2). Since it's decreasing, the highest value is +∞, and the lowest value is a(a + 2). Wait, but a(a + 2) could be positive or negative. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Let a = -1. Then, the second piece is f(x) = -1*x + 2*(-1) = -x - 2. For x < -1. So, as x approaches -∞, f(x) = -x -2 approaches +∞. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -(-1) -2 = 1 - 2 = -1. So, the range is (-1, ∞). \n\nSimilarly, if a = -3. Then, the second piece is f(x) = -3x + 2*(-3) = -3x -6. For x < -3. As x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches +∞. As x approaches -3 from the left, f(x) approaches -3*(-3) -6 = 9 -6 = 3. So, the range is (3, ∞).\n\nSo, in general, for a < 0, the range of the second piece is (a(a + 2), ∞). But since a is negative, let's see what a(a + 2) is.\n\na(a + 2) = a² + 2a. Since a is negative, a² is positive, 2a is negative. So, a² + 2a could be positive or negative. For example, if a = -1, a² + 2a = 1 - 2 = -1. If a = -2, a² + 2a = 4 -4 = 0. If a = -3, a² + 2a = 9 -6 = 3. If a = -0.5, a² +", "answer": "2"}

Let's do that first.\n\n**Step 1: Find fixed points**\n\nSet \\(f(x) = x\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda x(1 - x) = x\n\\]\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n\\lambda x - \\lambda x^2 = x \\implies \\lambda x - \\lambda x^2 - x = 0 \\implies x(\\lambda - \\lambda x - 1) = 0\n\\]\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(\\lambda - \\lambda x - 1 = 0\\). Solving the latter equation:\n\\[\n\\lambda - \\lambda x - 1 = 0 \\implies \\lambda(1 - x) = 1 \\implies 1 - x = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\implies x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n\\]\nNote that \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) must lie in the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Therefore, \\(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\geq 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\leq 1 \\implies \\lambda \\geq 1\\). For \\(\\lambda < 1\\), the fixed point \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) is outside the interval \\([0, 1]\\), so the only fixed point in \\([0, 1]\\) is \\(x = 0\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find period-2 points**\n\nPeriod-2 points satisfy \\(f(f(x)) = x\\) but \\(f(x) \\neq x\\). Let's compute \\(f(f(x))\\).\n\nFirst, compute \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[\nf(x) = \\lambda x(1 - x)\n\\]\nThen, compute \\(f(f(x))\\):\n\\[\nf(f(x)) = \\lambda [\\lambda x(1 - x)] \\left(1 - \\lambda x(1 - x)\\right)\n\\]\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\nf(f(x)) = \\lambda^2 x(1 - x) \\left(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2\\right)\n\\]\nWe need to solve \\(f(f(x)) = x\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) = x\n\\]\nBring all terms to one side:\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - x = 0\n\\]\nFactor out \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx \\left[ \\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - 1 \\right] = 0\n\\]\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and the solutions of:\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\n\\]\nWe are interested in solutions where \\(x \\neq 0\\) and \\(f(x) \\neq x\\). We already know \\(x = 0\\) is a fixed point, so we need to find non-zero solutions.\n\nLet's expand the equation \\(\\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\\):\n\nFirst, expand \\((1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2)\\):\n\\[\n(1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) = 1 \\cdot (1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - x \\cdot (1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2 - x + \\lambda x^2 - \\lambda x^3\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n1 - (\\lambda + 1)x + (2\\lambda)x^2 - \\lambda x^3\n\\]\nMultiply by \\(\\lambda^2\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 [1 - (\\lambda + 1)x + 2\\lambda x^2 - \\lambda x^3] = \\lambda^2 - \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)x + 2\\lambda^3 x^2 - \\lambda^3 x^3\n\\]\nSubtract 1:\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)x + 2\\lambda^3 x^2 - \\lambda^3 x^3 - 1 = 0\n\\]\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n- \\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\\lambda^3 x^2 - \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)x + (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\nMultiply through by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\\[\n\\lambda^3 x^3 - 2\\lambda^3 x^2 + \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)x - (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\nThis is a cubic equation in \\(x\\). Solving cubic equations can be complex, but we can look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is \\(-(\\lambda^2 - 1)\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(\\lambda^3\\). However, since \\(\\lambda\\) is a parameter, this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, note that fixed points \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) (when \\(\\lambda \\geq 1\\)) must satisfy \\(f(f(x)) = x\\), so they are roots of the equation. Therefore, we can factor out these roots.\n\nFor \\(\\lambda < 1\\), the only fixed point is \\(x = 0\\). Let's check if \\(x = 0\\) is a root of the cubic equation. Substitute \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda^3(0)^3 - 2\\lambda^3(0)^2 + \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)(0) - (\\lambda^2 - 1) = -(\\lambda^2 - 1)\n\\]\nFor this to be zero, \\(-(\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 = 1 \\implies \\lambda = 1\\). But since we are considering \\(\\lambda < 1\\), \\(x = 0\\) is not a root here. Therefore, for \\(\\lambda < 1\\), the equation \\(\\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \\lambda x + \\lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\\) must have non-zero roots.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(\\lambda \\geq 1\\), the fixed point \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) is in \\([0, 1]\\). Let's substitute \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) into the cubic equation and see if it satisfies the equation. However, since this is a fixed point, it should satisfy \\(f(x) = x\\), and therefore, \\(f(f(x)) = f(x) = x\\). Hence, \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) is a root of the cubic equation. Therefore, we can factor out \\(x - (1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda})\\) from the cubic.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Instead, let's consider that for period-2 points, the equation \\(f(f(x)) = x\\) must have solutions other than the fixed points. Therefore, the cubic equation must have roots other than the fixed points.\n\nLet’s consider the case when \\(\\lambda \\geq 1\\). The cubic equation will have the fixed point \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) as a root. To find other roots, we can perform polynomial division or use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since we need \\(f(f(x)) = x\\) but \\(f(x) \\neq x\\), we can set \\(y = f(x)\\), so \\(f(y) = x\\). Therefore, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) form a 2-cycle: \\(y = f(x)\\) and \\(x = f(y)\\). Thus, the system is:\n\\[\ny = \\lambda x(1 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\lambda y(1 - y)\n\\]\nWe can substitute \\(y\\) from the first equation into the second:\n\\[\nx = \\lambda [\\lambda x(1 - x)] (1 - \\lambda x(1 - x))\n\\]\nWhich is exactly the equation \\(f(f(x)) = x\\). So, we need to solve this system for \\(x \\neq y\\).\n\nTo find such \\(x\\), we can set up the equations:\n1. \\(y = \\lambda x(1 - x)\\)\n2. \\(x = \\lambda y(1 - y)\\)\n\nLet’s substitute \\(y\\) from the first equation into the second:\n\\[\nx = \\lambda [\\lambda x(1 - x)] \\left(1 - \\lambda x(1 - x)\\right)\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to the same cubic equation as before. Therefore, we need to solve this cubic equation for \\(x\\) such that \\(x \\neq y = f(x)\\).\n\nAlternatively, we can subtract the two equations. Let's write the system:\n\\[\ny = \\lambda x(1 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\lambda y(1 - y)\n\\]\nSubtracting these equations:\n\\[\ny - x = \\lambda x(1 - x) - \\lambda y(1 - y)\n\\]\nFactor out \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\ny - x = \\lambda [x(1 - x) - y(1 - y)]\n\\]\nBut this might not be helpful immediately. Let's instead express both equations and solve them together.\n\nLet’s denote \\(x \\neq y\\). Then, we have:\n\\[\ny = \\lambda x(1 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\lambda y(1 - y)\n\\]\nLet’s substitute \\(y\\) from the first equation into the second:\n\\[\nx = \\lambda [\\lambda x(1 - x)] \\left(1 - \\lambda x(1 - x)\\right)\n\\]\nAs before, this leads to the cubic equation. To solve this, we can consider that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are distinct solutions. Therefore, the cubic equation must have at least two distinct roots: the fixed point and the 2-cycle.\n\nHowever, solving the cubic equation directly is complex. Instead, let's consider the equation \\(f(f(x)) = x\\) and subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\\[\nf(f(x)) - x = 0\n\\]\nWe know that fixed points satisfy this equation, so we can factor out the known roots. For \\(\\lambda \\geq 1\\), one root is \\(x = 0\\) and another root is \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\). Let's factor these out.\n\nThe cubic equation can be written as:\n\\[\n\\lambda^3 x^3 - 2\\lambda^3 x^2 + \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)x - (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\nLet’s factor out \\(x - 0\\) (i.e., \\(x\\)):\n\\[\nx(\\lambda^3 x^2 - 2\\lambda^3 x + \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)) - (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\nBut this doesn't immediately help. Alternatively, we can factor out \\(x - (1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda})\\).\n\nLet’s denote \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) as a root. Let's perform polynomial division or use the factor theorem.\n\nLet’s substitute \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) into the cubic equation and verify if it satisfies:\n\\[\n\\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^3 - 2\\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 + \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) - (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\nThis calculation is quite involved, but let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: \\(\\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^3\\)\n\\[\n= \\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{\\lambda} + \\frac{3}{\\lambda^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^3}\\right)\n= \\lambda^3 - 3\\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda - 1\n\\]\n\nSecond term: \\(-2\\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\\)\n\\[\n= -2\\lambda^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\right)\n= -2\\lambda^3 + 4\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda\n\\]\n\nThird term: \\(\\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)\\)\n\\[\n= \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)\\left(\\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda}\\right)\n= \\lambda^2(\\lambda + 1)\\left(\\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda}\\right)\n= \\lambda(\\lambda + 1)(\\lambda - 1)\n= \\lambda(\\lambda^2 - 1)\n", "answer": "(3,4]"}

I need to find the smallest positive angle θ in degrees such that tan θ equals this big expression. Hmm, the numerator and denominator are both combinations of cosines and sines with different angles. Maybe I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator using trigonometric identities?\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equation:\n\ntan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]\n\nAlright, so both numerator and denominator have four terms each. Let me look at the numerator first.\n\nThe numerator is: cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°\n\nHmm, the first two terms are products of cosines, and the last two terms are products of sines. There's a formula for cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. Wait, but here we have cosA cosB - sinA sinB, which would be cos(A + B). Let me check:\n\ncos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. Yes, that's right.\n\nSimilarly, sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. Hmm, but in the denominator, there's a combination of sines and cosines as well. Maybe similar identities can be applied.\n\nLooking at the numerator:\n\ncos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20° = cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°\n\nSimilarly, cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50° = cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°\n\nSo then the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The first two terms: cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20° is cos(25°). Then the next two terms: cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50° is cos(85°). So the numerator is cos25° + cos85°. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow the denominator: sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°\n\nHmm, let's group the terms. Maybe group the first and third terms, and the second and fourth terms?\n\nFirst group: sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20° = sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°\n\nSecond group: - sin35° cos50° - cos35° sin50° = - [sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50°] = - sin(35° + 50°) = - sin85°\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst group: sinA cosB + cosA sinB = sin(A + B). So sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20° = sin(25°). Correct.\n\nSecond group: - sin35° cos50° - cos35° sin50° = - [sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50°] = - sin(85°). Because 35° + 50° = 85°. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, denominator is sin25° - sin85°.\n\nSo now we have tanθ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, let's try to simplify numerator and denominator further. Let's recall some trigonometric identities.\n\nFor the numerator: cos25° + cos85°. There's a sum-to-product identity for cosines: cosA + cosB = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]\n\nSimilarly, sin25° - sin85° can be transformed using the identity sinA - sinB = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nLet me apply these.\n\nFirst, numerator: cos25° + cos85°\n\nA = 25°, B = 85°, so (A + B)/2 = (110°)/2 = 55°, and (A - B)/2 = (-60°)/2 = -30°\n\nSo cos25° + cos85° = 2 cos55° cos(-30°). But cos(-30°) = cos30°, so that's 2 cos55° cos30°\n\nDenominator: sin25° - sin85°\n\nA =25°, B=85°, so (A + B)/2 = 55°, (A - B)/2 = -30°\n\nSo sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos55° sin(-30°). Sin(-30°) = -sin30°, so this becomes 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nsinA - sinB = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nSo sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos55° sin(-30°) = 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n[2 cos55° cos30°] / [-cos55°] = [2 cos55° cos30°] / (-cos55°) = -2 cos30°\n\nSo tanθ = -2 cos30°\n\nBut cos30° is √3/2, so tanθ = -2*(√3/2) = -√3\n\nTherefore, tanθ = -√3\n\nBut θ is supposed to be the smallest positive angle. So tanθ = -√3. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. The reference angle for tanθ = √3 is 60°, so the angles where tanθ = -√3 are 180° - 60° = 120°, and 360° - 60° = 300°, etc. But since we need the smallest positive angle, θ = 120°, because 120° is smaller than 300°.\n\nWait, but 120° is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative. So the principal value where tanθ = -√3 is 120°, which is the smallest positive angle. Therefore, θ = 120°.\n\nWait, but let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°, which became 2 cos55° cos30°, correct.\n\nDenominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°, which became -cos55°, correct.\n\nThen, [2 cos55° cos30°]/[-cos55°] = -2 cos30°, which is -2*(√3/2) = -√3. So tanθ = -√3. So θ = arctan(-√3). But since we need the smallest positive angle, we take 180° - 60° = 120°, because arctan(√3) is 60°, so tan(180° - 60°) = tan120° = -√3. So yes, θ = 120°.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest positive angle θ is \\boxed{120} degrees.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive angle \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(\\tan \\theta\\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.\n\nThe numerator is:\n\\[\n\\cos 5^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ + \\cos 35^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ - \\sin 5^\\circ \\sin 20^\\circ - \\sin 35^\\circ \\sin 50^\\circ\n\\]\nUsing the identity \\(\\cos(A + B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B\\), we can rewrite the terms:\n\\[\n\\cos 5^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ - \\sin 5^\\circ \\sin 20^\\circ = \\cos(25^\\circ)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos 35^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ - \\sin 35^\\circ \\sin 50^\\circ = \\cos(85^\\circ)\n\\]\nThus, the numerator simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\cos 25^\\circ + \\cos 85^\\circ\n\\]\n\nUsing the sum-to-product identity for cosines, \\(\\cos A + \\cos B = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)\\):\n\\[\n\\cos 25^\\circ + \\cos 85^\\circ = 2 \\cos 55^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is:\n\\[\n\\sin 5^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ - \\sin 35^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ + \\cos 5^\\circ \\sin 20^\\circ - \\cos 35^\\circ \\sin 50^\\circ\n\\]\nGrouping terms and using trigonometric identities:\n\\[\n\\sin 5^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ + \\cos 5^\\circ \\sin 20^\\circ = \\sin(25^\\circ)\n\\]\n\\[\n- \\sin 35^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ - \\cos 35^\\circ \\sin 50^\\circ = - \\sin(85^\\circ)\n\\]\nThus, the denominator simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sin 25^\\circ - \\sin 85^\\circ\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\sin A - \\sin B = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)\\):\n\\[\n\\sin 25^\\circ - \\sin 85^\\circ = - \\cos 55^\\circ\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\frac{2 \\cos 55^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ}{- \\cos 55^\\circ} = -2 \\cos 30^\\circ\n\\]\nSince \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = -\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThe smallest positive angle \\(\\theta\\) for which \\(\\tan \\theta = -\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\) (since \\(\\tan 120^\\circ = -\\sqrt{3}\\)).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).", "answer": "120^\\circ"}

Hmm, factorials can get really big, so calculating 42! directly isn't practical. There must be a smarter way to determine the number of trailing zeros without multiplying all the numbers up to 42.\n\nI remember that trailing zeros in a number come from factors of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of 42! contributes to a trailing zero.

That's because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, every multiple of 25 contributes an extra 5, and so on.\n\nSo, starting with 42 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 42 ÷ 5 = 8.4. Taking the floor of that gives 8. Then, 42 ÷ 25 = 1.68. Taking the floor gives 1. Next, 42 ÷ 125 = 0.336, which floors to 0. Since higher powers of 5 will also give 0, we can stop here. \n\nAdding those up: 8 + 1 = 9. So, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the process again. For each number from 1 to 42, count how many multiples of 5 there are. \n\nMultiples of 5 between 1 and 42 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. Each of these contributes at least one 5. Then, among these, numbers like 25 are multiples of 25, which is 5 squared. So, each of those contributes an additional 5. How many multiples of 25 are there? In the same range, it's 25 and 50, but 50 is beyond 42. So only 25. Therefore, that's one more 5. So total is 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nThat checks out. So, there are indeed 9 trailing zeros. Let me just confirm with another example to be sure. Let's take 10! which is 3628800, which has 2 trailing zeros. According to the formula, 10 ÷ 5 = 2, 10 ÷ 25 = 0. So 2 + 0 = 2. Correct. How about 25!? 25 ÷5 =5, 25 ÷25 =1, 25 ÷125=0. So 5 +1=6. Let me check 25! is 15511210043330985984000000, which has 6 zeros. Yep, that works. \n\nSo applying the same logic, 42! should have 9 trailing zeros. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of trailing zeros, which are formed by factors of 10. Each factor of 10 is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nWe use the formula to count the number of factors of 5 in \\(42!\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n- \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\\)\n- \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\\)\n- \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\)\n\nAdding these results gives:\n\\[\n8 + 1 + 0 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).", "answer": "9"}

Let me recall how to do this. Hmm, I think the area can be calculated using the cross product of vectors OA and OB divided by 2. Yeah, because the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors is the magnitude of their cross product, and the triangle is half of that. So, area = (1/2) * ||OA × OB||.\n\nFirst, let me write down the vectors OA and OB. OA is [1; 2; 3] and OB is [-3; -2; 1]. To compute the cross product, I need to use the determinant formula with the unit vectors i, j, k. Let me set that up.\n\nThe cross product OA × OB is calculated as:\n\n|i   j   k|\n|1   2   3|\n|-3 -2   1|\n\nSo expanding this determinant:\n\ni*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))\n\nLet me compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst component (i):\n2*1 = 2\n3*(-2) = -6, but since it's subtracted, it becomes - (-6) = +6\nSo 2 + 6 = 8. So the i component is 8.\n\nSecond component (j):\n1*1 = 1\n3*(-3) = -9\nSo 1 - (-9) = 1 + 9 = 10. But since it's subtracted, the j component is -10.\n\nThird component (k):\n1*(-2) = -2\n2*(-3) = -6, but it's subtracted, so - (-6) = +6\nSo -2 + 6 = 4. So the k component is 4.\n\nTherefore, OA × OB = [8; -10; 4]. Now, the magnitude of this vector is sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n8^2 = 64\n(-10)^2 = 100\n4^2 = 16\n\nSum: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180\n\nSo the magnitude is sqrt(180). Let's simplify sqrt(180). 180 = 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, the magnitude of the cross product is 6*sqrt(5).\n\nThen, the area of the triangle is half of that, so (1/2)*6*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recompute the cross product:\n\nFirst component (i):\n2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. Correct.\n\nSecond component (j):\n-(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.\n\nThird component (k):\n1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo cross product is indeed [8, -10, 4]. Then magnitude squared is 8² + (-10)² +4² = 64 + 100 +16=180. Square root of 180 is 6√5, half of that is 3√5. So the area is 3√5. Hmm, seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to compute the lengths of OA, OB, and AB, then use Heron's formula. Maybe that can confirm the answer.\n\nFirst, compute |OA|. OA is [1,2,3], so sqrt(1² +2² +3²) = sqrt(1 +4 +9)=sqrt(14).\n\nOB is [-3, -2,1], so sqrt((-3)^2 + (-2)^2 +1²)=sqrt(9 +4 +1)=sqrt(14). Interesting, both OA and OB have the same length, sqrt(14).\n\nThen, compute AB vector. AB = OB - OA = [-3 -1, -2 -2, 1 -3] = [-4, -4, -2]. So |AB| = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-4)^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(16 +16 +4)=sqrt(36)=6.\n\nSo sides of the triangle are sqrt(14), sqrt(14), 6. Let's use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(14) +6)/2 = (2sqrt(14) +6)/2 = sqrt(14) +3.\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nSo compute s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\ns - a = (sqrt(14) +3) - sqrt(14) = 3\n\ns - b = same as s -a =3\n\ns - c = (sqrt(14) +3) -6 = sqrt(14) -3\n\nSo area = sqrt( (sqrt(14)+3)(3)(3)(sqrt(14)-3) )\n\nSimplify inside the sqrt:\n\nFirst, multiply (sqrt(14) +3)(sqrt(14) -3) = (sqrt(14))² -3² =14 -9=5\n\nThen, multiply by 3*3=9. So total inside sqrt is 5*9=45\n\nTherefore, area = sqrt(45)=3*sqrt(5). Which matches the previous result. So that's good, both methods give the same answer. So the area is 3√5.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of triangle \\(OAB\\) is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of triangle \\(OAB\\) where the position vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are given, we use the cross product method.

So, we have triangle ABC with medians AD, BE, and CF intersecting at the centroid G. There's a line passing through G that's parallel to BC, and this line intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is 144, and we need to find the area of triangleENG. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties about centroids and medians. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might be useful later.\n\nNext, the line through G is parallel to BC. Since BC is the base of the triangle, a line parallel to it would create a smaller similar triangle somewhere inside ABC. But where exactly? Let me visualize this. If the line is parallel to BC and passes through G, then it must intersect AB and AC at some points M and N. The triangle formed by these points, M, N, and G? Wait, no, the problem says triangleENG. So, points E, N, and G? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the line passes through G and is parallel to BC. So, the line MN passes through G. Then, M is on AB, N is on AC. So, points M, G, N are colinear with MN parallel to BC. Then, triangleENG is formed by points E, N, and G. We need to find its area.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's place triangle ABC such that point B is at (0,0), C is at (2c,0), and A is at (a,b). Then, the centroid G would be the average of the coordinates of the vertices: G = ((a + 0 + 2c)/3, (b + 0 + 0)/3) = ((a + 2c)/3, b/3).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use a coordinate system where BC is horizontal. Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (2,0), so that BC is of length 2 units. Then, the midpoint D of BC is at (1,0). Let me assume point A is at (0, h), making ABC a triangle with base BC = 2 and height h. Then, the area of ABC is (2 * h)/2 = h. But the area is given as 144, so h = 144? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if BC is length 2, then area is (base * height)/2 = (2 * h)/2 = h. So h = 144. But maybe scaling will complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a general coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, let's set coordinates with point B at (0,0), point C at (c,0), and point A at (0,a), so that ABC is a right triangle for simplicity? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the type of triangle, so maybe a general triangle is better. Wait, but maybe using coordinates complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through the centroid G, which divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. So, perhaps the height of the triangle MNG from G to MN is 1/3 of the height of ABC. Wait, but MN is parallel to BC, so the distance between MN and BC would be related to the centroid's position.\n\nWait, in a triangle, if a line is drawn through the centroid parallel to the base, it divides the triangle into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. The smaller triangle would be similar to the original, and since the centroid is 2/3 of the way up the median, the height of the smaller triangle would be 1/3 of the original height. Therefore, the ratio of areas would be (1/3)^2 = 1/9. So the area of the smaller triangle would be 144 / 9 = 16. But wait, that is the area of triangle MNG? Wait, no, MN is parallel to BC, so the area ratio is 1/9. But MN is the line through G, so the area above MN (the smaller triangle) would be 16. But the problem asks for the area of triangleENG, which is different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find coordinates of points E, N, and G. Let's try coordinate geometry step by step.\n\nLet me place triangle ABC with coordinates: Let’s set point B at (0,0), point C at (2,0), and point A at (0,3h), so that the height from A to BC is 3h. Then, the area of ABC is (base * height)/2 = (2 * 3h)/2 = 3h. But the area is given as 144, so 3h = 144 ⇒ h = 48. Therefore, point A is at (0, 144). Wait, but this might complicate calculations. Alternatively, maybe set coordinates such that BC is from (0,0) to (2,0), and A is at (0, h), so the area is (2*h)/2 = h = 144 ⇒ h = 144. So coordinates would be B(0,0), C(2,0), A(0,144). Then centroid G is the average of the coordinates: ((0 + 0 + 2)/3, (0 + 0 + 144)/3) = (2/3, 48). So G is at (2/3, 48).\n\nNow, the line through G parallel to BC. Since BC is horizontal (from (0,0) to (2,0)), a line parallel to BC will also be horizontal. Therefore, the line through G(2/3, 48) parallel to BC is the horizontal line y = 48. Wait, but BC is at y=0, so the line y=48 is parallel and above BC. But in triangle ABC, the maximum y-coordinate is 144 at point A(0,144). Wait, but the line y=48 would intersect AB and AC.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,144), B at (0,0), and C at (2,0). So AB is the line from (0,0) to (0,144), which is the y-axis. AC is the line from (0,144) to (2,0). Let's find the equations of AB and AC.\n\nAB is the vertical line x=0. AC: from (0,144) to (2,0). The slope is (0 - 144)/(2 - 0) = -72. So equation is y - 144 = -72(x - 0) ⇒ y = -72x + 144.\n\nNow, the line MN is y=48. It intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since AB is x=0, plugging into y=48 gives M(0,48). For N, plug y=48 into AC's equation: 48 = -72x + 144 ⇒ -72x = 48 - 144 = -96 ⇒ x = (-96)/(-72) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333. So N is at (4/3, 48).\n\nSo points M(0,48), N(4/3,48), and line MN is from (0,48) to (4/3,48). Now, we need to find the area of triangleENG. Points E, N, G.\n\nFirst, where is point E? E is the intersection of median BE. Wait, the problem mentions medians AD, BE, CF intersecting at centroid G. So BE is the median from B to the midpoint of AC. Let me find coordinates of E.\n\nMidpoint of AC: point A is (0,144), point C is (2,0). Midpoint is ((0 + 2)/2, (144 + 0)/2) = (1,72). So median BE is the line from B(0,0) to midpoint E(1,72). So equation of BE: from (0,0) to (1,72). The slope is 72/1 = 72. So equation is y = 72x.\n\nPoint G is at (2/3,48). Let me check if G lies on BE. Plugging x=2/3 into y=72x gives y=72*(2/3)=48, which matches G's coordinates. So G is on BE, as expected.\n\nNow, triangleENG consists of points E(1,72), N(4/3,48), and G(2/3,48). Let's plot these points:\n\n- E is at (1,72)\n- N is at (4/3,48)\n- G is at (2/3,48)\n\nSo, triangleENG has vertices at (1,72), (4/3,48), and (2/3,48). Let me compute the area of this triangle.\n\nFirst, notice that points N and G are both at y=48, so the line NG is horizontal. The base of the triangle can be considered as NG, and the height would be the vertical distance from E to this base.\n\nLength of NG: coordinates from (4/3,48) to (2/3,48) is 4/3 - 2/3 = 2/3 units. The vertical distance from E(1,72) to the line y=48 is 72 - 48 = 24 units. So area is (base * height)/2 = (2/3 * 24)/2 = (48/3)/2 = 16/2 = 8? Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, base is NG: coordinates from x=4/3 to x=2/3, so the distance is 4/3 - 2/3 = 2/3. The height is the vertical distance from E to y=48, which is 72 - 48 = 24. So area is (base * height)/2 = (2/3 * 24)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n2/3 * 24 = 48/3 = 16. Then 16/2 = 8. So area is 8? But the original triangle has area 144, so 8 seems small. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's verify using coordinates. The coordinates of triangleENG are E(1,72), N(4/3,48), G(2/3,48). Let me use the shoelace formula to compute the area.\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx1 = 1, y1 = 72\n\nx2 = 4/3, y2 = 48\n\nx3 = 2/3, y3 = 48\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = 1*(48 - 48) = 1*0 = 0\n\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4/3)*(48 - 72) = (4/3)*(-24) = -32\n\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = (2/3)*(72 - 48) = (2/3)*24 = 16\n\nSum: 0 - 32 + 16 = -16\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2: |-16| / 2 = 8\n\nSo the area is indeed 8. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, since points N and G are on the same horizontal line y=48, the base is NG with length 2/3, and the height is the vertical distance from E to this line, which is 24. So area is (2/3 * 24)/2 = 24*(2/3)/2 = 24*(1/3) = 8. Yep, same result.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the area of ABC is 144. In our coordinate system, ABC has vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (0,144). The area is (2 * 144)/2 = 144, which matches. So our coordinate system is correctly scaled. Therefore, the area of triangleENG is 8. So the answer is 8. Therefore, \\boxed{8}.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem didn't specify the type of triangle, so maybe the coordinate system I chose is a right triangle, but the result should hold for any triangle. Is there a way to confirm that the area is always 1/18 of the original triangle? Wait, 144 / 18 = 8. So maybe the area is 1/18 of the original area.\n\nWait, how did we get 1/18? Let me think. The line through centroid parallel to BC creates a smaller triangle with area 1/9 of the original, but triangleENG is different. Wait, perhaps when you draw the median BE and take points E, N, G, the area is 1/18 of ABC. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since G divides the median BE in a 2:1 ratio, and N is a point on AC such that MN is parallel to BC. The line MN divides the triangle into a trapezoid and a smaller triangle. The ratio of similarity is 1/3, since the centroid is 2/3 along the median, so the height is 1/3 of the original. Therefore, the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. So the area of triangle MNG is 16. But triangleENG is part of this.\n\nLooking at triangle MNG, which has area 16. Then, triangle ENG is a part of it. Let me see. If I consider the line BE (median) passing through G, and point N is on AC. So from point N, drawing a line to G, and E is the midpoint of AC? Wait, no, E is the midpoint of AC, but in our coordinate system, E is the midpoint of AC, which in our coordinate system", "answer": "8"}

Plocha základny kužele je 30 čtverečních jednotek a jeho výška je 6,5 jednotek. Kolik krychlových jednotek je v jeho objemu?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the volume of a cone. The formula given is V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. The problem states that the base area is 30 square units and the height is 6.5 units. They want the volume in cubic units, specifically \"krychlových jednotek,\" which I think just means cubic units. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the volume of a cone. Yes, it's indeed one-third of the base area multiplied by the height. So, plugging in the numbers from the problem. The base area B is 30, and the height h is 6.5. \n\nLet me write that out: V = (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. Hmm, okay. Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 30 by 6.5. Let me do that. 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. So, 180 + 15 = 195. Then, multiply that by 1/3. So, 195 divided by 3. Let's see, 3 goes into 195 how many times? 3*60=180, so 195-180=15. 3*5=15. So, 60 + 5 = 65. Therefore, 195 divided by 3 is 65. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. 1/3 of 195 is 65. Yes, because 65*3=195. So, the volume should be 65 cubic units. \n\nBut let me double-check the multiplication steps to be sure. 30 * 6.5. 30*6=180, 30*0.5=15. 180+15=195. Then 195/3=65. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could compute 30 * 6.5 first. 6.5 is the same as 6 and a half. So, 30*6=180, 30*0.5=15. Adding those gives 195. Then divide by 3: 195/3. 3*60=180, so 195-180=15. 15/3=5. So, 60+5=65. Same result. \n\nSo, the volume is 65 cubic units. Therefore, the answer should be 65. \n\nWait, just to make sure there are no mistakes in units. The base area is given in \"čtverečné jednotek\" which translates to square units, and the height is in \"jednotek,\" so the volume will be in cubic units. So, the units are consistent, and the answer is 65 cubic units. \n\nI think that's it. The key steps are applying the formula correctly and performing the arithmetic accurately. No complicated steps here, just multiplication and division. Let me just confirm once more. \n\n30 multiplied by 6.5. Let's do it in decimal form. 30 * 6.5. 30*6=180, 30*0.5=15. 180+15=195. Then divide by 3: 195 divided by 3. 3*60=180, remainder 15. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, 60+5=65. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, 6.5 divided by 3 is approximately 2.1667, so 30*2.1667. Let's see, 30*2=60, 30*0.1667≈5. So 60+5≈65. That also checks out. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident the volume is 65 cubic units. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the cone is \\boxed{65} krychlových jednotek.\n</think>\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh \\), where \\( B \\) is the area of the base and \\( h \\) is the height. \n\nGiven:\n- The base area \\( B = 30 \\) square units\n- The height \\( h = 6.5 \\) units\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 \\times 6.5\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the product of the base area and the height:\n\\[\n30 \\times 6.5 = 180 + 15 = 195\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{195}{3} = 65\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is \\(\\boxed{65}\\) cubic units.", "answer": "65"}

I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. The fourth term is 200, and the eighth term is 500. I need to find the sixth term. Hmm, arithmetic sequences... right, they have a common difference between consecutive terms. So, the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give me the first term or the common difference. It gives me the fourth and eighth terms. Let me write down what I know. The fourth term is 200. So, using the formula, that would be a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200. Similarly, the eighth term is 500, so a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500.\n\nSo I have two equations:\n\n1. a_1 + 3d = 200\n2. a_1 + 7d = 500\n\nI can solve these two equations to find a_1 and d. If I subtract the first equation from the second, the a_1 terms will cancel out. Let me try that:\n\n(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\nSo that simplifies to 4d = 300. Therefore, d = 300 / 4 = 75. Okay, so the common difference is 75. Then, I can substitute back into the first equation to find a_1. Let's use equation 1:\n\na_1 + 3(75) = 200\n\n3*75 is 225. So:\n\na_1 + 225 = 200\n\nSubtract 225 from both sides:\n\na_1 = 200 - 225 = -25\n\nSo the first term is -25 and the common difference is 75. Now, the problem asks for the sixth term. Let's calculate that. Using the formula a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. For the sixth term, n=6:\n\na_6 = -25 + (6-1)*75\n\nCalculate 5*75 first. 5*70 is 350, and 5*5 is 25, so 350+25=375. Then:\n\na_6 = -25 + 375 = 350\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense. Let's verify the terms we have.\n\nFirst term: -25\n\nSecond term: -25 +75=50\n\nThird term:50+75=125\n\nFourth term:125+75=200 (which matches the given information)\n\nFifth term:200+75=275\n\nSixth term:275+75=350\n\nSeventh term:350+75=425\n\nEighth term:425+75=500 (also matches the given information)\n\nSo, yes, the sixth term is 350. That seems correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the denominator is. The denominator is 2² multiplied by 5⁷. Let me compute that first. \n\n2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125. So multiplying those together: 4 times 78125. Let me do that step by step. 4 times 78125. Well, 4 times 70000 is 280000, and 4 times 8125 is 32500. Adding those together: 280000 + 32500 = 312500. So the denominator is 312500. \n\nTherefore, the fraction is 21 divided by 312500. Now, converting that into a decimal. Since the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5, the decimal should terminate. But I need to make sure that the number of decimal places is equal to the maximum of the exponents of 2 or 5 in the denominator. Wait, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷, so the maximum exponent is 7. Therefore, the decimal should terminate after 7 decimal places. \n\nBut let me confirm that. For a fraction to terminate, the denominator must be of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are non-negative integers. Then, the number of decimal places needed is the maximum of a and b. So here, since we have 2² and 5⁷, the maximum is 7. Therefore, the decimal should terminate after 7 digits. \n\nSo, to convert 21/312500 into a decimal, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to make the denominator have equal exponents of 5 and 2, right? Because 5⁷ already has 7 fives, and the denominator has 2². So if I multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2) = 2^5, which is 32, then the denominator becomes 2^7 * 5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. \n\nSo let's compute that. Multiply numerator 21 by 32: 21 * 32. Let me calculate that. 20*32 = 640, and 1*32 = 32, so 640 + 32 = 672. So the numerator becomes 672, and the denominator becomes 10^7, which is 10,000,000. \n\nTherefore, 672 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.0000672. Let me check that. \n\nStarting from 672, dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. So 672 becomes 0.0000672. Let me verify that 21/(2²*5⁷) equals 0.0000672. \n\nFirst, let's compute 2²*5⁷ again. 2² is 4, 5⁷ is 78125. 4*78125 is 312500, as before. So 21 divided by 312500. Let's divide 21 by 312500. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 21/312500. Let's divide 21 by 312500. Since 312500 is 3.125 x 10^5. So 21 divided by 3.125 x 10^5. 21 divided by 3.125 is approximately 6.72, and then divided by 10^5 is 0.0000672. That matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use another approach. Let's write the original fraction as 21/(2² * 5⁷). To convert this to a decimal, we can express it as 21/(2² * 5⁷) = 21/( (2² * 5²) * 5⁵ ) = 21/(100 * 3125). Wait, 2²*5² is (2*5)^2 = 100, right? So 2²*5² = 100, and then 5⁷ is 5²*5⁵ = 25*3125. Wait, 5⁵ is 3125, so 5⁷ is 25*3125 = 78125. \n\nSo 21/(100 * 78125) = 21/(7812500). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 21/312500. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nOriginal denominator: 2² * 5⁷ = 4 * 78125 = 312500. So 21/312500. So when I split 5⁷ as 5² * 5⁵, then 2² * 5² = 100, so denominator becomes 100 * 5⁵. 5⁵ is 3125, so denominator is 100 * 3125 = 312500. So that's correct. So 21/(100 * 3125) = 21/312500. \n\nBut if I write 21/(100 * 3125), that is equivalent to (21/100)/3125. Which is the same as 21/(3125 * 100). Either way, it's 21/312500. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps do the division step by step. Let me try dividing 21 by 312500. \n\nFirst, note that 312500 is a large denominator. Let me see how many decimal places we need. Since the denominator is 312500, which is 3125 * 100. 3125 is 5⁵, so 3125 = 5*5*5*5*5=3125. So 312500 is 3125 * 100. \n\nAlternatively, maybe divide 21 by 3125 first, then divide by 100. Let's try that. \n\n21 divided by 3125: 3125 goes into 21 zero times. Add a decimal point, and append zeros. 3125 goes into 210 zero times, into 2100 zero times, into 21000 six times (since 6*3125=18750). Subtract 18750 from 21000: 21000 - 18750 = 2250. Bring down a zero: 22500. 3125 goes into 22500 seven times (7*3125=21875). Subtract: 22500 - 21875 = 625. Bring down a zero: 6250. 3125 goes into 6250 exactly two times. Subtract: 6250 - 6250 = 0. So 21 divided by 3125 is 0.00672. \n\nThen, divide that result by 100: 0.00672 / 100 = 0.0000672. So that's the same result as before. \n\nTherefore, the decimal representation is 0.0000672. Let me verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, since the denominator is 10^7 divided by something? Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷. To make it 10^7, which is 2⁷ * 5⁷, so we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2) = 2^5. Which is 32. So 21 * 32 = 672, and denominator becomes 2² * 5⁷ * 2⁵ = 2^(2+5) * 5⁷ = 2^7 * 5^7 = 10^7. So 672/10^7 = 0.0000672. Exactly. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.0000672. Let me check if there's a different way to approach this. Maybe prime factorization. \n\nThe original fraction is 21/(2² * 5⁷). The numerator is 21, which factors into 3*7. The denominator is 2²*5⁷. So when written as a decimal, since the denominator only has factors of 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate. The number of decimal places is determined by the maximum exponent in the prime factors. Here, the exponents are 2 for 2 and 7 for 5, so the decimal will have 7 digits. \n\nSo the decimal will be 21 multiplied by 10^(-7) divided by (2²*5⁷)/10^7. Wait, perhaps not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, to convert the fraction to a decimal, we can express it as multiplying numerator and denominator by a power of 2 or 5 to make the denominator a power of 10. Since the denominator has 7 fives, and only 2 twos, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to make the denominator 2^7*5^7=10^7. \n\nWhich is exactly what we did before: 21*32=672, denominator 10^7. So 672/10^7=0.0000672. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me just write out the decimal places to confirm. \n\nStarting from the decimal point, 0.0000672. Breaking it down:\n\n- The first digit after the decimal is 0.\n- Second digit: 0.\n- Third digit: 0.\n- Fourth digit: 0.\n- Fifth digit: 6.\n- Sixth digit: 7.\n- Seventh digit: 2.\n- Then it ends because the decimal terminates.\n\nYes, that's seven decimal places. So 0.0000672 is correct. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered different methods, checked the calculations multiple times, confirmed that the denominator being a product of 2s and 5s leads to a terminating decimal, and the number of digits is determined by the maximum exponent. All steps lead to the same result, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fraction $\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}$ converts to the finite decimal \\boxed{0.0000672}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) into a finite decimal, we start by examining the denominator.

Kolik pěticentových mincí má?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is: Hillary has eleven coins, all of which are dimes and nickels. The total value is 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?\n\nHmm, first, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two types of coins: dimes (which are worth 10 cents) and nickels (5 cents). She has a total of 11 coins, and together they add up to 75 cents. We need to find out how many nickels there are.\n\nAlright, so let's start by setting up some variables. Let me call the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. The problem states that the total number of coins is 11, so that gives us one equation:\n\nD + N = 11\n\nThen, the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since dimes are 10 cents each and nickels are 5 cents each, the total value can be represented as:\n\n10D + 5N = 75\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nI need to solve this system of equations to find the values of D and N. Let me think about the best way to approach this. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution because the first equation can be easily solved for one variable.\n\nFrom the first equation, D = 11 - N. Then, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, distribute the 10:\n\n10*11 - 10*N + 5N = 75\n\nSo that's 110 - 10N + 5N = 75\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n110 - 5N = 75\n\nNow, subtract 110 from both sides:\n\n-5N = 75 - 110\n\nWhich is:\n\n-5N = -35\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nN = (-35)/(-5) = 7\n\nSo, N equals 7. That means there are 7 nickels. Let me check this to make sure.\n\nIf there are 7 nickels, then the number of dimes is 11 - 7 = 4. Let's calculate the total value:\n\n4 dimes * 10 cents = 40 cents\n\n7 nickels * 5 cents = 35 cents\n\n40 + 35 = 75 cents. Yes, that matches the total value given. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations. Sometimes when setting up problems, it's easy to mix up the values. So, dimes are 10 cents, nickels 5 cents. So, 4 dimes would be 4*10=40, 7 nickels 7*5=35. 40+35=75. Perfect. And total coins: 4+7=11. All correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve this using elimination. Let's try that method to confirm.\n\nWe have the two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 5 to make the coefficients of N the same:\n\n5D + 5N = 55\n\nThen subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(10D + 5N) - (5D + 5N) = 75 - 55\n\nWhich gives:\n\n5D = 20\n\nSo, D = 4. Then plug back into the first equation: 4 + N = 11 => N = 7. Same result. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of all coins being dimes. If all 11 coins were dimes, the total value would be 11*10=110 cents. But the actual total is 75 cents, which is 110 - 75 = 35 cents less. Each nickel is worth 5 cents less than a dime. So, the number of nickels would be 35 / 5 = 7. That's another way to think about it. So, replacing 7 dimes with nickels reduces the total by 7*5=35 cents, bringing it down from 110 to 75. Therefore, there must be 7 nickels. That's a neat way to visualize it.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the conclusion that there are 7 nickels.

Jaká je pravděpodobnost, že součet čísel, která si vyberou, je sudý?", "question": "Paul a Jesse si každý náhodně vybere číslo z prvních šesti prvočísel. Jaká je pravděpodobnost, že součet čísel, která si vyberou, je sudý?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Paul and Jesse each picking a number randomly from the first six prime numbers, and we need to find the probability that the sum of their numbers is even. Hmm, okay. First, I should recall what the first six prime numbers are. Let me list them out. The primes start at 2, then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Yeah, those are the first six primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. So each of them is picking one of these numbers with equal probability, right?\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that the sum is even. I remember that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. If one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd. So, to find the probability that the sum is even, I need to calculate the probability that both Paul and Jesse pick even numbers or both pick odd numbers.\n\nFirst, let's check how many even and odd primes there are in the first six primes. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. The number 2 is the only even prime here. The rest (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd. So there's 1 even number and 5 odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that Paul picks an even number is 1/6, and the probability he picks an odd number is 5/6. The same goes for Jesse; since they're picking independently, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, the probability that both pick even numbers is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. The probability that both pick odd numbers is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36. Therefore, the total probability that the sum is even is 1/36 + 25/36 = 26/36. Simplifying that fraction, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 13/18. So the probability should be 13/18.\n\nWait, let me double-check. There's only one even prime, so Paul has a 1/6 chance to pick it, and same for Jesse. The rest of the time, they pick odd numbers. So for both odd, it's 5/6 for each, so 25/36. Adding the two even cases gives 1 + 25 = 26 over 36. Yep, 26/36 reduces to 13/18. That seems right.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe considering parity. Since there's only one even number, the chance that Paul picks even is 1/6, and odd is 5/6. For the sum to be even, either both are even or both are odd. Since there's only one even number, the probability that both are even is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. The probability that both are odd is 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36. So adding those gives 26/36. Yep, same result. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I list all possible pairs, but since there are 6 options for each, that's 36 total pairs. Let's see, how many of those pairs have an even sum. The even sum occurs when both are even or both are odd. There's only 1 even number, so the number of pairs where both are even is 1*1=1. The number of pairs where both are odd is 5*5=25. So total favorable pairs are 1 + 25 = 26. Therefore, the probability is 26/36 = 13/18. That's the same answer again. So that must be right.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 13/18.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the sum of their numbers is even is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}}.\n</think>\n\nThe first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, only 2 is even, and the rest (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd. \n\nTo determine the probability that the sum of the numbers picked by Paul and Jesse is even, we consider the cases where both numbers are even or both are odd. \n\n1. **Probability both pick even numbers:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Probability both pick odd numbers:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{25}{36}\n   \\]\n\nAdding these probabilities together gives the total probability of an even sum:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{26}{36} = \\frac{13}{18}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of their numbers is even is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}}.", "answer": "\\frac{13}{18}"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that if a point lies on a line, its coordinates should satisfy the equation of the line. That means when I plug in the x and y values of the point into the equation, the equation should hold true.\n\nAlright, so the point in question is (4, b). That means x is 4 and y is b. The line's equation is 3x + 2y = 12. So I need to substitute x with 4 and y with b in the equation and solve for b.\n\nLet me write that out step by step. Starting with the equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 12\n\nSubstitute x = 4 and y = b:\n\n3*(4) + 2*(b) = 12\n\nCalculating 3*4 first, which is 12:\n\n12 + 2b = 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for b. Let's subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with b:\n\n12 + 2b - 12 = 12 - 12\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2b = 0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n2b / 2 = 0 / 2\n\nWhich gives:\n\nb = 0\n\nWait, so if a is 4, then b must be 0? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plugging a = 4 and b = 0 back into the original equation:\n\n3*4 + 2*0 = 12 + 0 = 12\n\nWhich equals 12, so that works. Therefore, b is indeed 0.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just visualize the line to get a better intuition. The equation 3x + 2y = 12. If I rewrite it in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), it might help. Let's do that.\n\nStarting with 3x + 2y = 12\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n2y = -3x + 12\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 6\n\nSo the line has a slope of -3/2 and a y-intercept at (0, 6). If a is 4, then x is 4. Plugging x = 4 into the equation:\n\ny = (-3/2)*4 + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0\n\nYep, that's the same result. So when x is 4, y is 0. Therefore, the value of b is 0. I think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations. Both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the point \\((a, b)\\) lies on the line with the equation \\(3x + 2y = 12\\), we need to find the value of \\(b\\) when \\(a = 4\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = b\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3(4) + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(3 \\times 4\\):\n\n\\[\n12 + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2b = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nb = 0\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we substitute \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 0\\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n3(4) + 2(0) = 12 + 0 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe equation holds true, confirming the solution.

The problem is about a rectangle made up of twelve squares, each of size 1x1. The question is asking for the total area of the shaded region. The Asymptote code is provided, which might help visualize the figure. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the twelve 1x1 squares are arranged to form the rectangle. The Asymptote code mentions filling two specific areas: one from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), and another from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). Also, there are grid lines drawn from j=0 to 4 on the y-axis and j=0 to 3 on the x-axis. The diagonals are drawn from (0,4) to (3,0) and from (0,4) to (2,0). \n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally. The rectangle's total area must be twelve 1x1 squares, so the rectangle is 3 units wide and 4 units tall. That makes sense because 3x4=12. The grid lines divide the rectangle into 3 columns and 4 rows. \n\nNow, looking at the shaded areas. The first shaded region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The second shaded region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0), but wait, that's actually a trapezoid? Wait, (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0) to (0,0)? Wait, no, the Asymptote code says fill((0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle, gray(0.75)); So that's a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). Hmm. So two triangles: one with base along the left edge from (0,0) to (0,4) and a point at (2,0), and another triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). \n\nWait, let's confirm. The first fill command is (0,4)--(0,0)--(2,0)--cycle. That's a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). So that's a right triangle with legs of length 4 and 2, right? Because from (0,4) down to (0,0) is 4 units, and then from (0,0) to (2,0) is 2 units. So the area of that triangle would be (base * height)/2 = (4 * 2)/2 = 4. \n\nThe second fill command is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle. That's a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). Let's see: from (0,4) to (3,4) is 3 units, then down to (3,0), which is 4 units. Wait, but that's not a right triangle. Let's calculate its area. The base could be from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units, and the height would be the horizontal distance from this base to the point (0,4), which is 3 units. So area is (base * height)/2 = (4 * 3)/2 = 6. Alternatively, since it's a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0), we can compute the area using coordinates. The formula is |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|. Plugging in the coordinates: x1=0, y1=4; x2=3, y2=4; x3=3, y3=0. So:\n\nArea = |0*(4 - 0) + 3*(0 - 4) + 3*(4 - 4)| / 2\n= |0 + 3*(-4) + 3*0| / 2\n= | -12 | / 2\n= 12 / 2\n= 6. Yep, that's 6. So the second shaded area is 6.\n\nTherefore, the total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. But wait, let me double-check. The rectangle is 3x4, so area 12. If the shaded areas are 4 and 6, that's 10. The unshaded area would then be 2. Let me confirm if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure is different. Let me think again. The Asymptote code draws grid lines from j=0 to 4 on the y-axis and j=0 to 3 on the x-axis. So x from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 4. The diagonals are drawn from (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). So the first shaded triangle is from (0,4) down to (0,0) and over to (2,0). The second is from (0,4) over to (3,4) and then down to (3,0). \n\nWait, but the grid lines are drawn for j=0 to 4 on the y-axis, which would correspond to y from 0 to 4, and for j=0 to 3 on the x-axis, x from 0 to 3. So each square is 1x1, so the rectangle is 3 columns (x=0 to x=3) and 4 rows (y=0 to y=4). \n\nSo the first shaded triangle is a right triangle with base along the left edge from (0,0) to (0,4), and then a horizontal line to (2,0). So that's a triangle with base 4 and height 2. Area 4. \n\nThe second shaded triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So that's a triangle with base along the top edge from (0,4) to (3,4) which is 3 units, and then down to (3,0). So that's a right triangle with base 3 and height 4? Wait, no. Wait, the triangle is (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So from (0,4) to (3,4) is horizontal, then down to (3,0). So the triangle is a right triangle with legs of 3 and 4. Therefore, area is (3*4)/2 = 6. \n\nSo total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. Since the entire rectangle is 12, that makes sense. The unshaded area would be 12 - 10 = 2. Let me check if there are overlapping shaded regions or if I miscounted. The two shaded regions are separate? The first is from the left edge, the second is from the top edge. They don't overlap. So 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut let me visualize the Asymptote code again. The grid is drawn with x from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 4. The diagonals are from (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). The shaded regions are the two triangles. The first triangle is on the left side, the second is on the top side. So yes, they are separate. So total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the second triangle's area. Let's recalculate. The triangle with vertices (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So using coordinates, the area can be calculated via the shoelace formula. Let's list the coordinates in order:\n\n(0,4), (3,4), (3,0), (0,4).\n\nCompute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:\n\n0*4 + 3*0 + 3*4 = 0 + 0 + 12 = 12.\n\nCompute the sum of y_i x_{i+1}:\n\n4*3 + 4*3 + 0*0 = 12 + 12 + 0 = 24.\n\nSubtract the two: |12 - 24| = 12. Divide by 2: 6. So yes, 6. So that's correct. So total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut the problem says twelve squares of size 1x1. So the entire rectangle is 3x4, which is 12 squares. Therefore, the total area is 12. The shaded area is 10, so the answer should be 10. \n\nBut wait, let me check the figure again. The Asymptote code draws the grid lines as horizontal lines from j=0 to 4 on the y-axis and vertical lines from j=0 to 3 on the x-axis. So x ranges from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 4. Then the diagonals are drawn from (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). The shaded regions are the two triangles. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another shaded region that I missed? The problem says \"stínovaná oblasti\", which translates to \"shaded regions\". The Asymptote code fills two regions: the first fill is (0,4)--(0,0)--(2,0)--cycle, which is the first triangle, and the second fill is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle, which is the second triangle. So two regions total. So 4 + 6 = 10. So the answer is 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure is different? Let me think again. If the rectangle is divided into 12 squares, each 1x1, then the rectangle is 3x4. The shaded areas are two triangles. First triangle: from the left edge at (0,0) up to (0,4) and over to (2,0). Second triangle: from the top edge at (0,4) over to (3,4) and down to (3,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure is a 4x3 rectangle? But 4x3 is also 12. Wait, but the Asymptote code mentions (0,4) to (3,0), so y ranges up to 4, x up to 3. So it's 3 units in x and 4 in y. So 3x4. \n\nTherefore, total area 12. Shaded area 10. Unshaded area 2. \n\nBut wait, let me check if the two shaded triangles overlap. The first triangle is from (0,4) down to (0,0) and over to (2,0). The second triangle is from (0,4) over to (3,4) and down to (3,0). These two triangles are adjacent but do not overlap. So their areas are additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second triangle is a different shape? Let me confirm the coordinates again. The second fill is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle. So starting at (0,4), moving right to (3,4), then down to (3,0), then back to (0,4). So that's a triangle. The base is from (3,4) to (3,0), which is vertical, and the third point is (0,4). So the triangle has a vertical side of length 4 (from (3,4) to (3,0)) and a horizontal side from (3,0) to (0,4). Wait, no, the triangle is not a right triangle. Wait, the sides are from (0,4) to (3,4) which is horizontal, (3,4) to (3,0) which is vertical, and (3,0) back to (0,4). So it's a right triangle with legs along the horizontal and vertical axes. So the legs are 3 (from (0,4) to (3,4)) and 4 (from (3,4) to (3,0)), so area is (3*4)/2 = 6. Correct. \n\nSo both areas are 4 and 6. Total shaded area 10. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think of the entire rectangle. The total area is 12. If the shaded area is 10, then the unshaded area is 2. Let's see if that makes sense. The two unshaded regions would be the parts not covered by the shaded triangles. \n\nLooking at the first triangle: (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). So this covers the leftmost two columns from y=0 to y=4? Wait, no. Wait, (0,4) is the top-left corner, (0,0) is the bottom-left, and (2,0) is two units to the right on the bottom. So the triangle is covering the leftmost column from top to bottom, but only up to x=2 on the bottom. So it's a right triangle occupying the left edge and part of the bottom. \n\nThe second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So that's covering the top edge from x=0 to x=3, but it's a right triangle with vertices at the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right. So that triangle is covering the top edge and descending down to the right. \n\nSo the two triangles are on opposite corners of the rectangle. The first is on the bottom-left, the second on the top-right. They don't overlap, so their areas add up. \n\nTherefore, total shaded area is indeed 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut let me cross-verify. If the entire rectangle is 12, and the shaded area is 10, that seems plausible. But maybe the problem is trickier? Maybe the shaded regions are more complicated? Let's check the Asymptote code again. \n\nThe Asymptote code draws the grid lines with x from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 4. The diagonals are drawn from (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). The shaded regions are the two triangles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure is divided into smaller squares, and the shaded areas are parts of those squares. But since each square is 1x1, the area of each square is 1. The two triangles have areas 4 and ", "answer": "10"}
{"original_question": "Jaký je nejmenší kladný násobek čísla 450, jehož všechny číslice jsou nuly a jedničky?", "question": "Jaký je nejmenší kladný násobek čísla 450, jehož všechny číslice jsou nuly a jedničky?", "response": " Jaký je nejmenší kladný násobek čísla 450, jehož všechny číslice jsou nuly a jedničky?\n\nThe problem is asking for the smallest positive multiple of 450 such that all its digits are either 0 or 1. \n\nFirst, let's recall that 450 factors into prime factors as 2 × 3² × 5². Therefore, any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 3², and 5². \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 5² (25), it must end with 00, 25, 50, or 75. However, the digits can only be 0 or 1. The only possible ending is 00, since 25, 50, and 75 contain digits other than 0 and 1. Therefore, the number must end with two zeros.\n\nNext, the number must be divisible by 2. Since it already ends with 0 (actually 00), it is even, so that's satisfied.\n\nFor divisibility by 3² (9), the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. The digits can only be 0 or 1, so the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest such number would be a number composed of nine 1s followed by two 0s, i.e., 11111111100. However, we need to check if this number is indeed divisible by 450.\n\nWait, but maybe there is a smaller number. For example, perhaps arranging the 1s and 0s in a different order could result in a smaller number. However, since leading zeros are not allowed, the smallest number would have the least number of digits. The number 11111111100 has 11 digits, but maybe there's a smaller number with the same number of 1s but arranged to have smaller digits in the higher places.\n\nBut actually, numbers with the same number of digits but different arrangements can be smaller if the leftmost digits are smaller. However, since all non-zero digits are 1s, the leftmost digit is 1, which is the smallest possible. Therefore, the smallest number would indeed be the one with the 1s as far to the right as possible, but since we need to end with two zeros, the last two digits are 0s, and the rest can be 1s. Therefore, the smallest number is 11111111100.\n\nBut let's verify this. Let's check if 11111111100 is divisible by 450.\n\nFirst, divide 11111111100 by 450:\n\n11111111100 ÷ 450 = 11111111100 ÷ (45 × 10) = (11111111100 ÷ 10) ÷ 45 = 1111111110 ÷ 45.\n\nNow, divide 1111111110 by 45:\n\n1111111110 ÷ 45. Let's perform this division.\n\n45 × 24691358 = 45 × 24,691,358. Wait, this might be tedious, but alternatively, note that 45 is 9 × 5, so first divide by 5:\n\n1111111110 ÷ 5 = 222222222.\n\nThen divide 222222222 by 9:\n\n222222222 ÷ 9 = 24691358.\n\nSo, 222222222 ÷ 9 = 24691358. Therefore, 1111111110 ÷ 45 = 24691358. So yes, 11111111100 ÷ 450 = 24691358, which is an integer. Therefore, 11111111100 is indeed a multiple of 450.\n\nBut is there a smaller number? Let's think. Suppose we have fewer than nine 1s. Since the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9, the smallest number of 1s is 9. So we can't have fewer than nine 1s. Therefore, the minimal number of digits is 9 ones plus 2 zeros, totaling 11 digits. Therefore, 11111111100 is the smallest such number.\n\nHowever, perhaps arranging the 1s and 0s differently could result in a smaller number. For example, inserting zeros earlier might make the number smaller. Wait, but inserting zeros would require more digits. For example, if we have a number like 10111111100, but this has the same number of digits as 11111111100, but it's larger because the third digit is 0 instead of 1. Wait, no. Wait, 10111111100 is 1 followed by 0, then 1s, then 0s. But in reality, the position of the digits affects the numerical value. The leftmost digit has the highest place value, so a 0 in the second position would make the number smaller. Wait, but if we put a 0 in the second position, but the number must end with two zeros. Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose we have a number like 10111111100. Let's compare it to 11111111100. Which one is smaller?\n\nLet's write them out:\n\n1. 10111111100\n2. 11111111100\n\nComparing digit by digit:\n\nFirst digit: both 1.\n\nSecond digit: 0 vs. 1. So the first number is smaller here. But wait, but the second digit is 0 in the first number, making it 10111111100, which is indeed smaller than 11111111100. However, does 10111111100 satisfy all the conditions?\n\nLet's check:\n\nDigits: 1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. All digits are 0 or 1. Good.\n\nEnds with two zeros. Good.\n\nSum of digits: 1+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 8. Wait, that's 8 ones. 8 is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, 10111111100 is not divisible by 9, hence not divisible by 450. Therefore, that number doesn't work.\n\nSo even though it's a smaller number, it doesn't meet the digit sum requirement.\n\nTherefore, we need a number with exactly nine 1s and two 0s at the end. The rest of the digits (if any) must be 0s. But since we want the smallest number, we need to place the 1s as far to the right as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher place values. So putting 1s at the end would make the number smaller. However, we need to end with two zeros. Therefore, the minimal number is nine 1s followed by two zeros. So 11111111100.\n\nWait, but if we have nine 1s and two zeros at the end, that's 11 digits. If we try to place the two zeros somewhere else, but keeping the 1s as far right as possible, but since the number must end with two zeros, those two zeros have to be at the end. Therefore, the 1s have to be in the preceding digits. So the minimal number is indeed 11111111100.\n\nBut let's check if there is a smaller number with nine 1s and two zeros, but arranged such that the number is smaller. For example, 10000000000 is 10^10, but that has only one 1. To get nine 1s, we need to have nine 1s spread out with zeros in between and at the end. However, since the number must end with two zeros, the last two digits are zeros. The remaining digits (before the last two) must contain nine 1s. The minimal number would be the one where the 1s are as far to the right as possible, which is achieved by placing all nine 1s first and then the two zeros. But that's the number 11111111100. If we try to place the 1s with zeros in between, the number would be larger because the leading digits would still be 1s, but with zeros in between. For example, 10101010100 is smaller than 11111111100, but it has fewer 1s. Wait, no. Wait, 10101010100 has fewer 1s. Let's count: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0. That's five 1s. So the sum is 5, which is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, even if the number is smaller, it doesn't meet the digit sum requirement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe inserting zeros between the 1s can allow the number to have the same number of digits but smaller? For example, 11111111100 vs. 11111111001. Wait, but 11111111001 ends with a 1, which is invalid because it needs to end with two zeros. So we can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, 111111110010. But that adds more digits, making it larger. So no, inserting zeros in between would require adding more digits, which would make the number larger.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number must be 11111111100.\n\nBut let's confirm once again. Suppose we try a number with nine 1s and two zeros at the end. Any other arrangement would either have the same number of digits or more digits. Since we need the smallest number, we need the minimal number of digits. Since nine 1s and two zeros is 11 digits, which is the minimal possible (since nine 1s are needed for the digit sum), there cannot be a smaller number. Therefore, 11111111100 is indeed the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{11111111100}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest positive multiple of 450 with all digits 0 or 1 is \\boxed{11111111100}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive multiple of 450 such that all its digits are either 0 or 1, we start by noting the prime factorization of 450: \\(450 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\). \n\n1. **Divisibility by \\(5^2\\) (25)**: The number must end in 00 since it can only contain digits 0 or 1.\n2. **Divisibility by 2**: The number already ends in 0, so it is even.\n3. **Divisibility by \\(3^2\\) (9)**: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.\n\nThe smallest number of 1s required is 9. Therefore, the number must have nine 1s followed by two 0s. This gives the number 11111111100. \n\nVerification:\n- **Ends in 00**: Yes.\n- **Sum of digits**: \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9\\), which is a multiple of 9.\n- **Divisibility by 450**: \\(11111111100 \\div 450 = 24691358\\), an integer.\n\nThus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 with all digits 0 or 1 is \\(\\boxed{11111111100}\\).", "answer": "11,\\! 111,\\! 111,\\! 100"}

So, the setup is that there's a wheel shown in the image, and it's going to spin twice. Each time it spins, the number indicated by the arrow is randomly determined—each number on the wheel has an equal chance. The two numbers obtained from these spins determine a square on a chessboard. The first number is divided by 4, and the remainder (which would be 1, 2, or 3) indicates the column. The second number is divided by 5, and the remainder (1, 2, 3, or 4) indicates the row. Then, the figure is placed on the chessboard at the intersection of that column and row. The question is asking for the probability that the figure ends up on a dark square (stínovaný) of the chessboard.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a standard chessboard is structured. A chessboard has 8x8 squares, alternating between black and white. The top-left square is traditionally a dark square. Each subsequent square alternates colors. So, in terms of coordinates, if we consider rows and columns starting from 1, then the color of the square at (row, column) can be determined by whether (row + column) is even or odd. If it's even, it's a dark square; if odd, it's light. Wait, let me verify that. For example, row 1, column 1: 1+1=2, even, dark. Row 1, column 2: 1+2=3, odd, light. That seems right. So the color depends on the sum of the row and column numbers being even or odd.\n\nSo the key here is that the square at (row, column) is dark if (row + column) is even, and light otherwise. Therefore, to find the probability that the figure is on a dark square, we need to find the probability that the sum of the row and column determined by the two spins is even.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem. The first spin determines the column number modulo 4. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3. Each remainder is equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/3. The second spin determines the row number modulo 5. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, each with probability 1/4.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the first spin is divided by 4, giving a remainder of 1, 2, or 3. But since a standard die or wheel with numbers 1 to 4 would give remainders 1, 2, 3, 0 when divided by 4. But here, the problem states that the numbers indicated by the arrow are náhodně stanovena, with each number on the wheel being equally likely. So maybe the wheel has numbers 1 to 4, each with equal probability. Then when divided by 4, the remainders would be 1, 2, 3, 0. But the problem says \"the first number is divided by 4, which determines one of the remainders 1, 2, 3, which are labeled as columns.\" Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the wheel has numbers 1 to 4, but when you spin it, the number is divided by 4, and the remainder is taken, but since the numbers are 1-4, the remainders would be 1, 2, 3, 0. But the problem says \"the first number is divided by 4, cožurčujeň tento slounek,\" which translates to \"the first number is divided by 4, which determines one of the remainders 1, 2, 3, which are labeled as columns.\" Hmm, so perhaps the wheel has numbers 1-3, each with equal probability? Because if divided by 4, the remainders would be 1, 2, 3, 0, but the problem says the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3. So maybe the wheel is only labeled 1, 2, 3, each with equal probability. Similarly, the second number is divided by 5, giving remainders 1, 2, 3, 4. So the wheel for the second spin must have numbers 1-4, each with equal probability.\n\nTherefore, the first spin (column) can be 1, 2, or 3, each with probability 1/3. The second spin (row) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, each with probability 1/4. Then, the column and row numbers are determined by these remainders. Then, the figure is placed at the intersection of column (remainder of first spin divided by 4) and row (remainder of second spin divided by 5). Wait, but the column is determined by the first spin divided by 4? Wait, no. Wait, \"the first number is divided by 4, cožurčujeň tento slounek.\" So the first number is divided by 4, and the remainder (1, 2, 3) determines the column. So the remainder is the column number. Similarly, the second number divided by 5 gives a remainder (1, 2, 3, 4) which is the row number.\n\nWait, but if you divide a number by 4, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3. But the problem says \"the remainder is 1, 2, 3.\" So perhaps the wheel is labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, but when you spin it, if it lands on 4, the remainder is 0? But the problem states that the remainder is 1, 2, 3, which are the columns. Therefore, maybe the wheel is only labeled 1, 2, 3, each with equal probability, so when you spin it, the remainder is the number itself, since 1, 2, 3 divided by 4 give remainders 1, 2, 3. Similarly, the second wheel is labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, each with equal probability, so when spun, the remainder is the number itself, since 1, 2, 3, 4 divided by 5 give remainders 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the column is determined by the first spin (1-3), and the row by the second spin (1-4).\n\nTherefore, the column can be 1, 2, or 3, each with probability 1/3, and the row can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, each with probability 1/4. Then, each combination of column and row is equally likely? Wait, no. Because the column has 3 possibilities and the row has 4, the total number of possible outcomes is 3*4=12. Each outcome is equally likely, each with probability 1/12. So each square that can be reached has probability 1/12.\n\nBut the chessboard is 8x8, so there are 64 squares. However, the possible squares we can reach are only columns 1-3 and rows 1-4. So the total number of reachable squares is 3*4=12. Each of these 12 squares has a certain color, either dark or light. So to find the probability that the figure is on a dark square, we need to count how many of these 12 squares are dark, then divide by 12.\n\nAlternatively, since each outcome is equally likely, we can compute the number of (column, row) pairs where column + row is even, and divide that by 12.\n\nSo let's list all possible column and row combinations:\n\nColumns: 1, 2, 3\n\nRows: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nSo all pairs:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTotal of 12 pairs.\n\nNow, for each pair, check if column + row is even.\n\nLet's go through them:\n\n(1,1): 1+1=2 (even) → dark\n\n(1,2): 1+2=3 (odd) → light\n\n(1,3): 1+3=4 (even) → dark\n\n(1,4): 1+4=5 (odd) → light\n\n(2,1): 2+1=3 (odd) → light\n\n(2,2): 2+2=4 (even) → dark\n\n(2,3): 2+3=5 (odd) → light\n\n(2,4): 2+4=6 (even) → dark\n\n(3,1): 3+1=4 (even) → dark\n\n(3,2): 3+2=5 (odd) → light\n\n(3,3): 3+3=6 (even) → dark\n\n(3,4): 3+4=7 (odd) → light\n\nNow, count the number of dark squares:\n\nLooking at each pair:\n\n1. Dark\n\n2. Light\n\n3. Dark\n\n4. Light\n\n5. Light\n\n6. Dark\n\n7. Light\n\n8. Dark\n\n9. Dark\n\n10. Light\n\n11. Dark\n\n12. Light\n\nSo that's 1,3,6,8,9,11 → 6 dark squares.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 dark squares out of 12 possible. Therefore, the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but hold on. But a standard chessboard has alternating colors, so in each row, the colors alternate. So if we have a 3x4 grid, the coloring would be different. Wait, but the problem says the figure is placed on a chessboard. So even though the reachable squares are only 3 columns and 4 rows, the coloring is still like a chessboard, alternating starting from the top-left corner. So the color of square (row, column) is determined by (row + column) mod 2. If it's 0 (even), dark; if 1 (odd), light. So in our case, as we checked, 6 out of 12 squares are dark. So the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me verify again.\n\nIn the 3x4 grid:\n\nColumns 1-3, rows 1-4.\n\nEach square's color is (row + column) even or odd.\n\nLet me list all 12 squares with their colors:\n\n1. (1,1): 1+1=2 → even → dark\n\n2. (1,2): 1+2=3 → odd → light\n\n3. (1,3): 1+3=4 → even → dark\n\n4. (1,4): 1+4=5 → odd → light\n\n5. (2,1): 2+1=3 → odd → light\n\n6. (2,2): 2+2=4 → even → dark\n\n7. (2,3): 2+3=5 → odd → light\n\n8. (2,4): 2+4=6 → even → dark\n\n9. (3,1): 3+1=4 → even → dark\n\n10. (3,2): 3+2=5 → odd → light\n\n11. (3,3): 3+3=6 → even → dark\n\n12. (3,4): 3+4=7 → odd → light\n\nYes, 6 dark, 6 light. So 6/12=1/2 probability.\n\nBut wait, the chessboard is 8x8, but we are only using 3 columns and 4 rows. However, the color pattern still repeats every 2 rows and 2 columns. So even in the full chessboard, the color of any square (r,c) is (r + c) mod 2. So in our limited grid, the same applies.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake here. The maybe the remainders are not directly the column and row. Wait, the problem says: \"the first number is divided by 4, cožurčujeň tento slounek,\" which means that the remainder (1,2,3) corresponds to the column. Similarly, \"druže číslo je děleno 5, cožurčujeň tento řádky.\" So the remainder (1,2,3,4) corresponds to the row. So column is (first spin remainder), row is (second spin remainder). So the column can be 1,2,3 and row can be 1,2,3,4, each with probabilities 1/3 and 1/4 respectively. So each (column, row) pair is equally likely, with probability 1/12. And as we saw, half of them are dark. Therefore, the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, in a standard chessboard, the probability that a random square is dark is 1/2, since it's alternating. But here, the possible squares are only 3 columns and 4 rows. However, in our case, even though the grid is smaller, the number of dark and light squares is equal (6 each out of 12). Therefore, the probability is 1/2. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose we have a 3x4 grid. How many dark squares are there? Let's see. In each row, the colors alternate. For row 1 (starting with dark), columns 1 and 3 are dark. For row 2 (starting with light), columns 2 and 4 are dark. For row 3 (starting with dark), columns 1 and 3 are dark. So rows 1 and 3 have 2 dark squares each, row 2 has 2 dark squares. Wait, row 1: columns 1 and 3 (dark). Row 2: columns 2 and 4 (light). Wait, no, row 2 starts with light, so columns 2 and 4 would be dark? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a standard chessboard, the color alternates starting with dark at (1,1). So (1,1): dark, (1,2): light, (1,3): dark, (1,4): light.\n\nRow 2: (2,1): light, (2,2): dark, (2,3): light, (2,4): dark.\n\nRow 3: (3,1): dark, (3,2): light, (3,3): dark, (3,4): light.\n\nSo in row 1: columns", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}

The exponents of 2 and 5 will determine the number of decimal places. Since the denominator is \\(5^7 \\cdot 2^8\\), the number of decimal places will be determined by the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5.

Actually, the original denominator is \\(5^7 \\cdot 2^8\\). To convert this to a power of 10, we need to balance the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are more 2s (8) than 5s (7), we can multiply numerator and denominator by \\(5^1\\) to make the exponents equal:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{4321 \\cdot 5}{5^8 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{4321 \\cdot 5}{10^8}\n   \\]\n   So, the numerator becomes \\(4321 \\cdot 5 = 21605\\).

Maybe there are some trigonometric identities or patterns I can use here.\n\nFirst off, I remember that products of sines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas, but with eight terms, that might get complicated.

Wait, 100° is 80° + 20°, 120° is 100° + 20°, 140° is 120° + 20°, 160° is 140° + 20°. So all angles are 20° increments from 20° to 160°, which is eight terms. So, maybe there's a symmetry here.\n\nAlso, note that sine has some periodicity and symmetry properties. For example, sin(θ) = sin(180° - θ). Let me check if any of these angles can be expressed as 180° minus another angle in the list.\n\nLooking at sin100°, that's sin(180° - 80°) = sin80°, which is already in the list. Similarly, sin120° = sin(180° - 60°) = sin60°, which is also in the list. Sin140° = sin(180° - 40°) = sin40°, and sin160° = sin(180° - 20°) = sin20°. So, actually, the terms from 100° to 160° are duplicates of the terms from 80° to 20°, but in reverse order. Therefore, the product from 20° to 160° is the same as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Because sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°, so when we multiply all eight terms, we have the square of the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°.\n\nSo, the original product simplifies to [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.\n\nNow, let me compute the product inside the square first. Let's denote P = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Then the answer will be P squared.\n\nI need to compute P. Let me recall some values. Sin60° is √3/2, which is a known value. So sin60° = √3/2. So that's one term. The other terms: sin20°, sin40°, sin80°. Hmm. Maybe there's a product formula for multiple sines. Alternatively, use product-to-sum identities step by step.\n\nAlternatively, note that sin80° is equal to sin(60° + 20°), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, use complex numbers or roots of unity? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the identity for the product of sines in arithmetic progression. Wait, there is a formula for the product of multiple sine terms with angles in arithmetic progression. Let me recall. For example, the product of sin(kπ/(2n+1)) for k=1 to n is sqrt((2^n + 1)/2^(2n))). But I might be mixing up different formulas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the identity that sinθ = cos(90° - θ). Let me try that. So sin20° = cos70°, sin40° = cos50°, sin80° = cos10°. So then P = cos70° cos50° cos10°. Hmm. So now, the product is cos10° cos50° cos70°. Maybe that's easier to handle.\n\nWait, there's a known formula for the product of cosines at specific angles. For example, the product cos10° cos50° cos70° can be evaluated using certain trigonometric identities. Let me recall that. I think there's a formula that says cosA cosB cosC = [cos(A+B+C) + cos(-A+B+C) + cos(A-B+C) + cos(A+B-C)] / 8 or something like that, but I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the identity for multiple angles. Let me think. If I consider the identity for sin5θ or something, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in some cases, products of cosines can be expressed using sine functions. For example, the identity:\n\ncosθ cos(60° - θ) cos(60° + θ) = (1/4) sin3θ.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Let me test θ = 0°. Then cos0° cos60° cos60° = 1 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. On the other hand, (1/4) sin0° = 0. So that doesn't match. Maybe the identity is different.\n\nWait, maybe another identity. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the identity for cosA cosB cosC when A + B + C = 180°, but in this case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which is not 180°, so that might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the formula for sin3θ. Let me recall that sin3θ = 3sinθ - 4sin^3θ. But not sure how that connects.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the product step by step. Let's compute cos70° cos50° first, then multiply by cos10°.\n\nFirst, compute cos70° cos50°. There's a product-to-sum identity: cosA cosB = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.\n\nSo cos70° cos50° = [cos120° + cos20°] / 2. Cos120° is cos(180° - 60°) = -cos60° = -0.5. So that becomes [-0.5 + cos20°] / 2.\n\nThen, multiply this by cos10°:\n\n[(-0.5 + cos20°)/2] * cos10° = [ -0.5 cos10° + cos20° cos10° ] / 2.\n\nNow, compute each term:\n\nFirst term: -0.5 cos10°\n\nSecond term: cos20° cos10°, again use product-to-sum:\n\ncos20° cos10° = [cos30° + cos10°]/2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n[ -0.5 cos10° + (cos30° + cos10°)/2 ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first:\n\n-0.5 cos10° + (cos30° + cos10°)/2\n\nConvert -0.5 cos10° to - (1/2) cos10°, and then add (1/2) cos30° + (1/2) cos10°:\n\nSo total is (-1/2 cos10° + 1/2 cos10°) + 1/2 cos30° = 0 + 1/2 cos30°.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 1/2 cos30°, and then divided by 2:\n\nSo overall, we have (1/2 cos30°) / 2 = cos30° / 4.\n\nBut cos30° is √3/2, so this becomes (√3/2) / 4 = √3 / 8.\n\nTherefore, the entire product cos10° cos50° cos70° equals √3 / 8.\n\nWait, so that means P = √3 / 8. Therefore, the original product is [√3 / 8]^2 = 3 / 64.\n\nBut let me check my steps again because this seems a bit straightforward. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting with P = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Then, converted sin20° to cos70°, sin40° to cos50°, sin80° to cos10°, so P = cos70° cos50° cos10°. Then applied product-to-sum on cos70° cos50°, got [cos120° + cos20°]/2 = [-0.5 + cos20°]/2. Then multiplied by cos10°:\n\n[-0.5 cos10° + cos20° cos10°]/2. Then converted cos20° cos10° to [cos30° + cos10°]/2. Then substituted back:\n\n[-0.5 cos10° + (cos30° + cos10°)/2] / 2.\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nFirst term: -0.5 cos10° = -1/2 cos10°\n\nSecond term: (cos30° + cos10°)/2 = 1/2 cos30° + 1/2 cos10°\n\nAdding these together: (-1/2 cos10° + 1/2 cos10°) + 1/2 cos30° = 0 + 1/2 cos30°\n\nThen divide by 2: (1/2 cos30°)/2 = 1/4 cos30°\n\nBut cos30° is √3/2, so 1/4 * √3/2 = √3/8. Therefore, P = √3/8. Therefore, the original product is (√3/8)^2 = 3/64.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check if there's another way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use complex numbers. Express each sine as complex exponentials, multiply them all together, and see if the result simplifies. But that might be tedious. Alternatively, recall that sinθ = cos(90° - θ), so sin20° = cos70°, sin40° = cos50°, sin60° = cos30°, sin80° = cos10°, so the product becomes cos10° cos30° cos50° cos70°. Wait, but earlier I had cos10° cos50° cos70°, but now with sin60°, which is cos30°, so actually, the product is cos10° cos30° cos50° cos70°. Wait, so maybe I missed that.\n\nWait, original product: sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = cos70° cos50° cos90°- but no, sin60° is cos30°, so the product is cos70° * cos50° * cos30° * cos10°, which is four terms: cos10° cos30° cos50° cos70°. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I only had three terms: cos10° cos50° cos70°, but here there is an extra cos30°. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal product: sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.\n\nExpressed in cos:\n\nsin20° = cos70°,\n\nsin40° = cos50°,\n\nsin60° = cos30°,\n\nsin80° = cos10°.\n\nTherefore, the product is cos70° * cos50° * cos30° * cos10°. So four terms. But in my previous calculation, I converted sin60° to cos30°, but when I first converted the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, I thought of it as [sin20° sin40° sin80° sin60°], which is equivalent to [sin20° sin40° sin80° sin60°]. Then, using sin60° = cos30°, and the rest as before. So, actually, the product is cos70° cos50° cos30° cos10°. So that's four terms. But in my earlier steps, I only considered three terms. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me retrace. The original product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°. As we established, sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°, so the product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Then, converting each sine to cosine:\n\nsin20° = cos70°,\n\nsin40° = cos50°,\n\nsin60° = cos30°,\n\nsin80° = cos10°,\n\nTherefore, the product inside the square is cos70° * cos50° * cos30° * cos10°, which is four terms. So, my earlier mistake was forgetting the cos30° term. Therefore, the product P is actually cos10° cos30° cos50", "answer": "\\frac{9}{256}"}

The problem is asking about the shape defined by the equation z = c in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z). The options are various geometric figures like line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc. Hmm. Let me recall what cylindrical coordinates are. In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented by (r, θ, z), where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, θ is the angle in the xy-plane from the positive x-axis, and z is the height, just like in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nSo the equation given is z = c. That means that for any point (r, θ, z) satisfying this equation, the z-coordinate is fixed at c. But r and θ can take any value, right? So in cylindrical coordinates, if z is fixed, then this should represent all points that are at a constant height z = c, but can extend infinitely in the r direction (since r isn't restricted) and θ can go all the way around. So in other words, this would be a horizontal plane cutting through the z-axis at height c. \n\nWait, but in Cartesian coordinates, a plane like z = c is a horizontal plane. So in cylindrical coordinates, since z is just the same as in Cartesian, that equation should still represent a plane. So is the answer (C) Rovinná plocha, which is Czech for \"plane\"? Let me check the options again. (A) Line, (B) Circle, (C) Rovinná plocha, (D) Koule, (E) Válek, (F) Kužel. So (C) is plane. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. In cylindrical coordinates, sometimes people get confused if there are restrictions. But the equation z = c doesn't restrict r or θ, so r can be any non-negative value, and θ can be any angle. So in cylindrical coordinates, this is indeed a plane. \n\nAlternatively, if the equation were, say, r = c, that would be a cylinder of radius c around the z-axis. Similarly, θ = c would be a half-plane starting at the z-axis and extending outwards at angle θ. But z = c is a horizontal plane. So yes, I think (C) is the correct answer. Let me confirm once more. \n\nIf we convert z = c to Cartesian coordinates, it's straightforward: since z is the same in both systems, it's just the plane z = c. So in Cartesian terms, it's a plane, so in cylindrical terms, it's still a plane. Therefore, the answer should be (C).\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates represents all points where the \\( z \\)-coordinate is fixed at \\( c \\), while \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) can take any values.

Each term is the reciprocal of the square of a trigonometric function. I need to find the sum of these three terms. I wonder if there's a pattern or identity that relates these angles somehow. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might be helpful here. The first thing that comes to mind is the Pythagorean identity: \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\). But here, we have reciprocals of squares, so maybe not directly applicable. Maybe there's a way to express these in terms of tangent or something else?\n\nWait, \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 \\theta}\\) is equal to \\(1 + \\tan^2 \\theta\\), right? Because \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\), so squaring that gives \\(\\tan^2 \\theta = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{\\cos^2 \\theta}\\), and adding 1 gives \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta}{\\cos^2 \\theta} = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2 \\theta}\\). So, yes, that identity holds. So maybe I can rewrite each term using that identity.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nFirst term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 10^\\circ} = 1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ\\)\n\nSecond term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 20^\\circ} = 1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ\\), since \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta} = 1 + \\cot^2 \\theta\\). Wait, actually, let me confirm that. If I use the identity \\(\\cot^2 \\theta + 1 = \\csc^2 \\theta\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta}\\). Yes, that's correct. So, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 20^\\circ} = 1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ\\).\n\nThird term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 40^\\circ} = 1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\\). Same reasoning.\n\nSo substituting back into the original expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ) + (1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ) + (1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, it's:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to computing \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\\) and then adding 3. Not sure if that's easier, but maybe there's a relationship between these angles. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the angles: 10°, 20°, 40°. 10° is half of 20°, and 20° is half of 40°. So maybe there's a double-angle or half-angle identity that can connect these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are related in such a way that their complements add up to 90°, but 10°, 20°, and 40° don't add to 90°. Wait, 10° + 80° = 90°, 20° + 70° = 90°, 40° + 50° = 90°, but none of those angles correspond here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the angles. Let's note that 40° is twice 20°, so maybe using the double-angle identity. Let's recall that \\(\\tan 2\\theta = \\frac{2\\tan \\theta}{1 - \\tan^2 \\theta}\\). Similarly, \\(\\cot \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta}\\), so \\(\\cot 2\\theta = \\frac{1 - \\tan^2 \\theta}{2\\tan \\theta}\\). Maybe we can use these identities to relate the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using co-function identities. For example, \\(\\cot 40^\\circ = \\tan(90^\\circ - 40^\\circ) = \\tan 50^\\circ\\). But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, \\(\\cot 20^\\circ = \\tan 70^\\circ\\). Hmm. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all terms in terms of sine or cosine. Let's see:\n\n\\(\\tan^2 10° = \\frac{\\sin^2 10°}{\\cos^2 10°}\\), and \\(\\cot^2 20° = \\frac{\\cos^2 20°}{\\sin^2 20°}\\), and \\(\\cot^2 40° = \\frac{\\cos^2 40°}{\\sin^2 40°}\\). So adding them together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin^2 10°}{\\cos^2 10°} + \\frac{\\cos^2 20°}{\\sin^2 20°} + \\frac{\\cos^2 40°}{\\sin^2 40°}\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can relate these terms through some multiple-angle formulas or identities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific value that this sum equals, and it's a known trigonometric identity or a specific angle. Let me check if plugging in the values gives a recognizable number.\n\nAlternatively, compute each term numerically and see if their sum plus 3 is a nice number.

Squared is approximately \\(0.4131759\\). Reciprocal is approximately \\(2.419\\).\n\nAdding these together: 1.0314 + 8.5563 + 2.419 ≈ 11.0067. Then adding 3 gives approximately 14.0067. Hmm, that's very close to 14. So maybe the exact value is 14? Let me check that.\n\nWait, if the sum of the three original terms is approximately 14, then the exact value is 14. Let me verify that.\n\nBut wait, when I computed each term:\n\n1. \\(1/\\cos^2 10°\\): Let's compute more accurately.\n\nFirst, \\(\\cos 10°\\):\n\nUsing calculator, \\(\\cos 10° ≈ 0.984807753012208\\). Squared: \\(0.984807753012208^2 ≈ 0.96984631\\). Reciprocal: \\(1/0.96984631 ≈ 1.031436384\\).\n\nSecond term: \\(\\sin 20° ≈ 0.3420201433256687\\). Squared: ≈ 0.116977778440517.

Reciprocal: ≈ 2.419218958.\n\nSumming these: 1.031436384 + 8.556349187 + 2.419218958 ≈ 1.0314 + 8.5563 = 9.5877 + 2.4192 ≈ 12.0069. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, maybe my calculator is more precise.\n\nWait, let me use more precise values:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\(\\cos 10° = \\cos(\\pi/18) ≈ 0.984807753012208\\).

Reciprocal: ≈ 2.419218958.\n\nAdding them: 1.031436384 + 8.556349187 = 9.587785571 + 2.419218958 ≈ 12.00690453. Then adding 3 gives approximately 15.0069. Wait, hold on, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is:\n\n1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°). So that's the first term (≈1.0314) + second term (≈8.5563) + third term (≈2.4192) ≈ 1.0314 + 8.5563 + 2.4192 ≈ 12.0069. Then adding 3? Wait, no. Wait, in the previous steps, when I converted each term to 1 + tan²θ etc., then summed them up, getting 3 + sum of tan² and cot² terms. But when I computed numerically, the original terms sum to ≈12.0069. But 12.0069 is close to 12, but the user's problem is written as:\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original problem is:\n\n1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°). So that's three terms. If I compute each term numerically:\n\n1. 1/(cos²10°): ≈1.0314\n\n2. 1/(sin²20°): ≈8.5563\n\n3. 1/(sin²40°): ≈2.4192\n\nAdding these: ≈1.0314 + 8.5563 + 2.4192 ≈12.0069. So approximately 12.0069, which is roughly 12. So maybe the exact value is 12? But when I calculated earlier by converting to tan² and cot² terms, I thought it was 14. Wait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°)\n\nFirst term: 1/(cos²10°) = sec²10°, which is equal to 1 + tan²10°, correct.\n\nSecond term: 1/(sin²20°) = csc²20°, which is equal to 1 + cot²20°, correct.\n\nThird term: 1/(sin²40°) = csc²40°, which is equal to 1 + cot²40°, correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum is:\n\n(1 + tan²10°) + (1 + cot²20°) + (1 + cot²40°) = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°\n\nSo if I compute tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°, add to 3, that's the total.\n\nBut when I computed numerically, I got approximately 12.0069, which would mean tan²10°", "answer": "12"}

The problem is asking how many sides a convex polygon has if the sum of all its interior angles except one is 1070 degrees. Hmm, right. So, first, I need to recall some formulas related to polygons and their angles.\n\nI remember that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees. That's a key formula. So, if we have a polygon with n sides, the total sum is (n-2)*180. But in this problem, they mention that the sum of all the interior angles except one is 1070 degrees. That means if we subtract that one missing angle from the total sum, we get 1070. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nTotal sum - missing angle = 1070\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(n-2)*180 - missing angle = 1070\n\nSo, if I can find the total sum first, then subtract 1070 to find the missing angle. But wait, since the polygon is convex, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees. That's an important point. So, the missing angle must be less than 180 degrees. Therefore, the total sum must be 1070 + missing angle, which would be less than 1070 + 180 = 1250 degrees. So, the total sum is between 1070 and 1250 degrees.\n\nBut the total sum is also equal to (n-2)*180. So, we can set up an inequality:\n\n1070 < (n-2)*180 < 1250\n\nWait, actually, since the total sum is 1070 plus something less than 180, it's (n-2)*180 < 1250. So, that gives us an upper bound for (n-2)*180. Similarly, the total sum is at least 1070, so (n-2)*180 > 1070. Therefore, we can write:\n\n1070 < (n-2)*180 < 1250\n\nSo, let's solve for n. First, divide all parts by 180:\n\n1070/180 < n-2 < 1250/180\n\nCalculating 1070 divided by 180. Let's see, 180*5 = 900, 1070 - 900 = 170. So, 170/180 is 1.777..., so total is 5 + 1.777... = 6.777...\n\nSimilarly, 1250 divided by 180: 180*6 = 1080, so 1250 - 1080 = 170. Again, 170/180 is 1.777..., so 6 + 1.777... = 7.777...\n\nSo, n - 2 is between approximately 6.777 and 7.777. Since n has to be an integer (number of sides can't be a fraction), n - 2 must be 7. Therefore, n = 9.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If n - 2 is between 6.777 and 7.777, then n - 2 must be 7, since it's the only integer in that interval. Therefore, n = 7 + 2 = 9. So, the polygon has 9 sides? Let me verify that.\n\nIf n = 9, then the total sum of interior angles is (9-2)*180 = 7*180 = 1260 degrees. Then, if we subtract the missing angle, which is 1260 - 1070 = 190 degrees. Wait, but in a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees. But 190 degrees is greater than 180, which would make the polygon non-convex. That's a problem. Hmm, so this contradicts the requirement that the polygon is convex.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states that it's a convex polygon. Therefore, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees. So, the missing angle is (total sum) - 1070, which must be less than 180. Therefore:\n\nTotal sum = 1070 + missing angle < 1070 + 180 = 1250\n\nSo, (n - 2)*180 < 1250\n\nTherefore, n - 2 < 1250 / 180 ≈ 6.944...\n\nTherefore, n - 2 must be less than 6.944, so n - 2 can be at most 6, so n = 8. Let's check that.\n\nIf n = 8, total sum is (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080. Then, missing angle is 1080 - 1070 = 10 degrees. That's okay, because 10 degrees is a valid interior angle in a convex polygon. All angles are less than 180. So, that works.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated n - 2 as approximately 6.777, but since n must be integer, n - 2 is 7? But that gives a missing angle of 190, which is invalid. So, there's a conflict here.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let's think again.\n\nIf the sum of all interior angles except one is 1070, then total sum is 1070 + x, where x is the missing angle. Since the polygon is convex, x must be less than 180. Therefore, total sum must be less than 1070 + 180 = 1250. So, (n - 2)*180 < 1250. Therefore, n - 2 < 1250 / 180 ≈ 6.944, so n - 2 ≤ 6, so n ≤ 8.\n\nBut then, if n = 8, total sum is 1080, so x = 10 degrees. Then, all angles are valid. But if n = 8, then the total sum is 1080, and if we remove one angle, 10 degrees, then the remaining 7 angles sum to 1070. That works.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered n - 2 as 7, which would be n = 9, but that gives x = 190, which is invalid. Therefore, n cannot be 9. Therefore, the correct answer is n = 8.\n\nWait, so where was my mistake earlier? I think I miscalculated the bounds. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe key point is that the missing angle x must be positive and less than 180. So, 0 < x < 180. Therefore, total sum is 1070 + x, which must be greater than 1070 and less than 1070 + 180 = 1250. So, (n - 2)*180 must be in (1070, 1250). Then, n - 2 must satisfy 1070 / 180 < n - 2 < 1250 / 180.\n\nCalculating 1070 / 180: 180*5 = 900, 1070 - 900 = 170. 170 / 180 = 1.777..., so total is 5 + 1.777... = 6.777...\n\nSimilarly, 1250 / 180: 180*6 = 1080, 1250 - 1080 = 170. 170 / 180 = 1.777..., so total is 6 + 1.777... = 7.777...\n\nTherefore, n - 2 must be between approximately 6.777 and 7.777. But n - 2 must be an integer because n is an integer. Therefore, the only integer in that interval is 7. Therefore, n - 2 = 7, so n = 9. But wait, hold on. If n - 2 = 7, then n = 9. But then, as we saw earlier, total sum is (9 - 2)*180 = 1260. Therefore, missing angle is 1260 - 1070 = 190, which is more than 180, which is invalid for a convex polygon. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nSo, this suggests that there is no solution? But that can't be right. The problem must have a solution. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"Kolik stran by měl konvexní mnohoúhelník, pokud součet všech jeho vnitřních úhů kromě jednoho je 1070°?\" So, the sum of all interior angles except one is 1070 degrees. So, the total sum is 1070 plus one angle less than 180. So, the total sum is between 1070 and 1250. But (n - 2)*180 must be in that interval. So, n - 2 must be such that (n - 2)*180 is in (1070, 1250). So, let's compute (n - 2) = 1070 / 180 ≈ 5.944, and (n - 2)*180 = 1250 gives n - 2 ≈ 6.944. Therefore, n - 2 must be 6 or 7. Because 6.944 is between 6 and 7, but n - 2 must be integer. Therefore, possible n - 2 is 6 or 7.\n\nIf n - 2 = 6, then n = 8. Total sum is 6*180 = 1080. Missing angle is 1080 - 1070 = 10°, which is valid.\n\nIf n - 2 = 7, n = 9. Total sum is 7*180 = 1260. Missing angle is 1260 - 1070 = 190°, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only n = 8 is possible. Hence, the polygon has 8 sides. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nWait, so the problem didn't specify that the missing angle is an integer? But even if it did, 10° is valid. So, 8 sides is the answer.\n\nBut why did the initial calculation suggest n = 9? Because I thought n - 2 had to be 7, but that leads to an invalid angle. So, the correct answer is 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of sides is 8.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again.\n\nIf n = 8, total sum is 1080. If one angle is 10°, then the other 7 angles sum to 1070°, which is exactly the given value. Since all angles are less than 180°, the polygon is convex. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible n. For example, if n - 2 = 6.5, but n must be integer. So, no. Therefore, only n = 8 is possible.\n\nHence, the convex polygon has 8 sides.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe convex polygon has \\boxed{8} sides.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), we start by using the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\(n\\) sides, which is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). \n\nGiven that the sum of all interior angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), we can write:\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ - \\text{missing angle} = 1070^\\circ\n\\]\nSince the polygon is convex, the missing angle must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles must be between \\(1070^\\circ\\) and \\(1250^\\circ\\) (since \\(1070^\\circ + 180^\\circ = 1250^\\circ\\)).\n\nWe set up the inequality:\n\\[\n1070^\\circ < (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ < 1250^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1070}{180} < n - 2 < \\frac{1250}{180}\n\\]\n\\[\n5.944 < n - 2 < 6.944\n\\]\n\nSince \\(n - 2\\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \\(6\\). Therefore, \\(n = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\nVerifying, the total sum of the interior angles for \\(n = 8\\) is:\n\\[\n(8-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 6 \\times 180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ\n\\]\nThe missing angle is:\n\\[\n1080^\\circ - 1070^\\circ = 10^\\circ\n\\]\nSince \\(10^\\circ\\) is valid for a convex polygon, the solution is correct.\n\nThus, the convex polygon has \\(\\boxed{8}\\) sides.", "answer": "8"}

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers are inverses modulo 23, their product is congruent to 1 modulo 23. So, the problem states that t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23. That means:\n\nt * (t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nAlright, so my equation is t(t + 2) ≡ 1 (mod 23). Let me write that out algebraically:\n\nt(t + 2) = 1 + 23k, where k is some integer.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nt² + 2t = 1 + 23k\n\nSo, rearranging terms:\n\nt² + 2t - 1 = 23k\n\nWhich implies that t² + 2t - 1 must be divisible by 23. So, t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.\n\nNow, since t is an integer between 1 and 22 (because it's odd and 0 < t < 23), I can solve this quadratic congruence by testing possible values of t. But testing all 11 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 21) might take some time. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, I can solve the quadratic equation t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. Let's try completing the square or using the quadratic formula modulo 23.\n\nFirst, let's try completing the square:\n\nt² + 2t + 1 ≡ 2 mod 23\n\nSo, (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23\n\nTherefore, t + 1 ≡ ±√2 mod 23\n\nBut √2 modulo 23 is not straightforward. Let me check the squares modulo 23 to see which numbers squared give 2 mod 23.\n\nCompute squares modulo 23:\n\n1² = 1\n\n2² = 4\n\n3² = 9\n\n4² = 16\n\n5² = 25 ≡ 2\n\nOh, wait! 5² is 25, which is 2 mod 23. So, √2 mod 23 is ±5.\n\nTherefore, t + 1 ≡ ±5 mod 23.\n\nSo, t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 or t + 1 ≡ -5 mod 23.\n\nCase 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 4 mod 23. But t must be odd, and 4 is even, so this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: t + 1 ≡ -5 mod 23 ⇒ t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 17 mod 23. 17 is odd and between 1 and 22, so this is valid.\n\nTherefore, t = 17 is the solution.\n\nWait, let me verify this. Let's check if t = 17 is odd (yes, 17 is odd) and 0 < 17 < 23 (yes). Then t + 2 = 19. Let's check if 17 * 19 ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\n17 * 19 = 323. Now divide 323 by 23: 23 * 14 = 322, so 323 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that works. So 17 is indeed the solution.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other solutions. Since we solved the quadratic congruence and got t ≡ 4 mod 23 and t ≡ 17 mod 23. The first gives t = 4, which is even, so invalid. The second gives t = 17, which is valid. So 17 is the unique solution in the range 0 < t < 23.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check manually for all odd t between 1 and 21 to be thorough.\n\nLet me list all odd numbers from 1 to 21:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21.\n\nFor each t, compute t(t + 2) mod 23 and see if it's 1.\n\n1: 1*3=3 ≡3≠1\n\n3: 3*5=15≡15≠1\n\n5:5*7=35≡35-23=12≠1\n\n7:7*9=63≡63-2*23=63-46=17≠1\n\n9:9*11=99≡99-4*23=99-92=7≠1\n\n11:11*13=143≡143-6*23=143-138=5≠1\n\n13:13*15=195≡195-8*23=195-184=11≠1\n\n15:15*17=255≡255-11*23=255-253=2≠1\n\n17:17*19=323≡323-14*23=323-322=1≡1.

Therefore, the unique solution is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unique odd integer is \\boxed{17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the unique odd integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 0 < t < 23 \\) and \\( t + 2 \\) is the inverse of \\( t \\) modulo 23, we start with the congruence:\n\n\\[\nt(t + 2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 2t - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nCompleting the square on the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n(t + 1)^2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(t + 1)^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23.

Therefore, the solutions to \\( (t + 1)^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23} \\) are:\n\n\\[\nt + 1 \\equiv \\pm 5 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two cases:\n\n1. \\( t + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{23} \\) which simplifies to \\( t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23} \\).

So, if I let the side length be 's', then the volume V = s^3 = 1 cubic foot. To find the side length, I can take the cube root of the volume. So, s = cube root of 1. The cube root of 1 is 1, because 1*1*1=1. So, the side length is 1 foot. Wait, that makes sense. If each edge is 1 foot, then the volume is 1 cubic foot.\n\nNow, the surface area of a cube is calculated as 6 times the area of one face. Each face is a square with side length 's', so area of one face is s^2. Therefore, total surface area is 6*s^2. Since we found that s = 1 foot, substituting that in, the surface area would be 6*(1)^2 = 6*1 = 6 square feet. So, the total surface area is 6 square feet.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Let's verify step by step.\n\n1. Volume of cube = side^3 = 1 cubic foot. So, side = 1 foot. Correct.\n\n2. Surface area of cube = 6 * (side)^2. Plugging in 1 foot, we get 6*(1)^2 = 6. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Like, maybe converting units or something? But the problem states it's in square feet, and the volume is also in cubic feet, so all units are consistent. The cube root of 1 is definitely 1, so the side length is 1 foot. Then surface area is 6*(1)^2. Yeah, that's 6.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The key steps are recognizing that the cube root of the volume gives the side length, then plugging that into the surface area formula. Since both volume and surface area formulas for a cube use the side length, once you have the side length, the rest is straightforward calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 square feet. Let me just write that in the box as per the instructions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total surface area is \\boxed{6} square feet.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks for the total surface area in square feet of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot. \n\n1. The volume of a cube is given by \\( s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length. Given the volume is 1 cubic foot, we solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s^3 = 1 \\implies s = \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \\text{ foot}\n   \\]\n\n2. The total surface area of a cube is given by \\( 6s^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length. Substituting \\( s = 1 \\) foot:\n   \\[\n   6s^2 = 6 \\times (1)^2 = 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total surface area of the cube is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) square feet.", "answer": "864 \\mbox{ inches}^2"}

Hmm, let me recall what a conjugate is. If I remember correctly, the conjugate of a binomial expression like a + b is a - b. So in this case, the conjugate of 5 + √3 should be 5 - √3. That makes sense because conjugates usually just change the sign of the radical part. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the product of these two numbers. So that would be (5 + √3) multiplied by (5 - √3). I think there's a formula for multiplying conjugates, maybe the difference of squares formula? Let me verify. \n\nThe difference of squares formula states that (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². If I apply that here, where a is 5 and b is √3, then the product should be 5² minus (√3)². Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 5 squared is 25. Then, (√3) squared is just 3, because squaring a square root cancels them out. So subtracting those gives 25 - 3, which is 22. Therefore, the product should be 22. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Maybe I should multiply it out the long way to check. Let's do that. \n\nMultiplying (5 + √3)(5 - √3) using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst terms: 5 * 5 = 25\nOuter terms: 5 * (-√3) = -5√3\nInner terms: √3 * 5 = 5√3\nLast terms: √3 * (-√3) = - (√3)² = -3\n\nNow, adding all these together: 25 - 5√3 + 5√3 - 3. \n\nNotice that the middle terms, -5√3 and +5√3, cancel each other out. So we're left with 25 - 3, which is indeed 22. \n\nSo both methods give the same result. That confirms that the answer is 22. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think again. The original number is 5 + √3. Its conjugate is 5 - √3. When you multiply them, you eliminate the radical terms, which is why it's called the conjugate—it simplifies the expression to a rational number. In this case, 22 is a rational number, so that checks out. \n\nI can't think of any mistakes in this reasoning. The key was recognizing that the product of a binomial and its conjugate simplifies using the difference of squares. Both the formula and the expanded multiplication lead to the same answer. So yeah, I'm confident that the result is 22.\n</think>\n\nThe product of \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and its conjugate \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\) can be computed using the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\n(5 + \\sqrt{3})(5 - \\sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 25 - 3 = 22\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{22}\\)", "answer": "22"}

Let me think about how sequences work here. First, let me recall that the sequence of odd numbers is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The first term is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so forth. \n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Let me verify that. For the first term, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + (1 - 1)*2 = 1 + 0 = 1, which is correct. For the second term, n=2: a_2 = 1 + (2 - 1)*2 = 1 + 2 = 3, that's right. Third term: 1 + (3 - 1)*2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Yep, seems like the formula works.\n\nSo applying this formula to find the 2003rd term. Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2, and n is 2003. Plugging into the formula: a_2003 = 1 + (2003 - 1)*2. Let me compute that step by step. First, subtract 1 from 2003: 2003 - 1 = 2002. Then multiply by 2: 2002 * 2. Hmm, 2000*2 is 4000, and 2*2 is 4, so 4000 + 4 = 4004. Then add the initial 1: 1 + 4004 = 4005. So the 2003rd term should be 4005.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to think about it. The sequence of odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, ..., so the k-th odd number is 2k - 1. Let me test that formula. For k=1: 2*1 -1 = 1, correct. k=2: 2*2 -1 = 3, correct. k=3: 2*3 -1 =5, yes. So if that's the case, then the 2003rd term would be 2*2003 -1. Let's compute that. 2*2003 is 4006, minus 1 is 4005. Same result. So that's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using induction or some other method. Suppose I want to see if there's a pattern. The first term is 1, which is 2*1 -1. The second term is 3, which is 2*2 -1. The third term is 5, 2*3 -1. So yes, it seems that each term is 2 times its position in the sequence minus 1. Therefore, for position 2003, it's 2*2003 -1. \n\nBut let me also think about the general approach. If I have an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2. So substituting, a_n = 1 + (n -1)*2. Simplify that: 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n -1. So that's the same as the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = 2n -1. So for n=2003, a_2003 = 2*2003 -1 = 4006 -1 = 4005. \n\nAll methods lead to the same answer, so I can be confident that the 2003rd term is 4005. Let me just check with a smaller number to make sure. Let's say the 5th term. Using the formula: 2*5 -1 = 10 -1 =9. Let's count: 1 (1st), 3 (2nd), 5 (3rd), 7 (4th), 9 (5th). Yep, that's correct. So the formula works here. Another check: 10th term. 2*10 -1 =19. The sequence up to 10th term: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. Yep, 19 is the 10th term. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, applying this formula to n=2003, the result is 4005. I think that's solid. No mistakes in the reasoning here. The key was recognizing the arithmetic sequence with common difference 2 and using the nth term formula, or alternatively, noticing the pattern that the kth odd number is 2k -1. Both approaches lead to the same conclusion, so the answer must be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 2003rd term of the sequence is \\boxed{4005}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a_1\\) is 1 and the common difference \\(d\\) is 2. \n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(d = 2\\), and \\(n = 2003\\):\n\\[\na_{2003} = 1 + (2003 - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2003} = 1 + 2002 \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2003} = 1 + 4004\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2003} = 4005\n\\]\n\nAn alternative way to verify this is by noting that the kth odd number is given by the formula \\(2k - 1\\).

The question is asking for the value of g(f(5) - 1). Hmm, right. I need to figure out what this composite function evaluates to when the input is 5 inside f first, then subtract 1, and then plug that into g. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should start with the inner function, which is f(5). Since f(x) is defined as 2x - 3, substituting 5 into that function should give me 2 times 5 minus 3. Let me compute that. 2 times 5 is 10, and then subtracting 3 gives me 7. So, f(5) equals 7. Got that part.\n\nNow, the next step is to subtract 1 from f(5). So that would be 7 - 1. Let me do that subtraction. 7 minus 1 is 6. So, the result of f(5) - 1 is 6. Alright, so now I have to find g of this result, which is g(6).\n\nLooking at the function g(x), it's defined as x + 1. So substituting 6 into g(x) would be 6 + 1. Let me add those numbers. 6 plus 1 is 7. So, g(6) equals 7. Therefore, the value of g(f(5) - 1) should be 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting over, f(5) is 2*5 -3 = 10 -3 =7. Then 7 -1 =6. Then g(6) is 6 +1 =7. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I messed up any steps here. Let me just confirm the order of operations. The problem is g(f(5) -1), so inside-out, first compute f(5), then subtract 1, then apply g. That's exactly what I did. So the answer should be 7. I think that's correct. No, I can't see any errors here. Maybe check once more:\n\nf(5) = 2*5 -3 =7. Then f(5) -1 =7 -1=6. Then g(6)=6 +1=7. Yep, that's consistent.

I need to solve the equation sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 1/3. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the argument inside the sine function first. \n\nFirst, I remember that arccot(1/x) is the same as arctan(x) if x is positive, but I need to be careful here. Wait, arccot(z) is equal to arctan(1/z) when z is positive, but there might be a sign consideration depending on the quadrant. Let me confirm that. \n\nActually, the relationship between arccot and arctan is that arccot(z) = arctan(1/z) when z > 0, and arccot(z) = arctan(1/z) + π when z < 0. So, if x is positive, then arccot(1/x) is arctan(x). If x is negative, then arccot(1/x) would be arctan(x) + π. But in this case, since we have arccot(1/x), and the argument inside the sine function is arctan(x) + arccot(1/x). Let me check.\n\nWait, if x is positive, then arccot(1/x) is arctan(x). So, the argument becomes arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). If x is negative, then arccot(1/x) is arctan(x) + π. So, the argument would be arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π. So, depending on the sign of x, the argument inside the sine function is either 2 arctan(x) or 2 arctan(x) + π. Therefore, maybe I can split the problem into two cases: x positive and x negative.\n\nBut before that, let me make sure if arctan(x) is defined for all real x. Yes, arctan(x) is defined for all real numbers. Similarly, arccot(1/x) is defined for all x except x=0, because 1/x is defined only when x ≠ 0. So, the domain of the equation is all real numbers except x=0.\n\nSo, x ≠ 0. Now, let's consider the two cases: x > 0 and x < 0.\n\nCase 1: x > 0.\n\nThen arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). So, the equation becomes sin(arctan(x) + arctan(x)) = sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2: x < 0.\n\nThen arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. So, the equation becomes sin(arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π) = sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = 1/3.\n\nBut sin(θ + π) = -sinθ, so sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = -sin(2 arctan(x)). Therefore, in the case x < 0, the equation becomes -sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3, so sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nFor x > 0: sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.\n\nFor x < 0: sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nTherefore, we can handle both cases by solving sin(2 arctan(x)) = ±1/3, depending on the sign of x.\n\nLet me first handle the general case. Let’s let θ = arctan(x). Then, since x > 0, θ is in (0, π/2). For x < 0, θ is in (-π/2, 0). Then, 2θ is in (0, π) for x > 0 and in (-π, 0) for x < 0.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to work with the general solution for sin(2θ) = k. The solutions for 2θ would be 2θ = arcsin(k) + 2πn or 2θ = π - arcsin(k) + 2πn, where n is any integer. Then θ would be (arcsin(k) + 2πn)/2 or (π - arcsin(k) + 2πn)/2. Then x = tanθ.\n\nBut since θ is related to x through θ = arctan(x), we need to consider the principal values. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider Case 1: x > 0.\n\nWe have sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.\n\nLet’s set θ = arctan(x), so θ is between 0 and π/2. Then, 2θ is between 0 and π.\n\nThe equation becomes sin(2θ) = 1/3. So, 2θ = arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = π - arcsin(1/3).\n\nTherefore, θ = (1/2) arcsin(1/3) or θ = (π - arcsin(1/3))/2.\n\nBut θ = arctan(x), so x = tanθ. Therefore, the solutions are:\n\nx = tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] and x = tan[(π - arcsin(1/3))/2].\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: x < 0.\n\nWe have sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nBut here, θ = arctan(x) is between -π/2 and 0. Then, 2θ is between -π and 0.\n\nSo, sin(2θ) = -1/3. The solutions for 2θ would be 2θ = arcsin(-1/3) or 2θ = π - arcsin(-1/3). But arcsin(-1/3) is -arcsin(1/3), so:\n\n2θ = -arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = π + arcsin(1/3).\n\nTherefore, θ = (-arcsin(1/3))/2 or θ = (π + arcsin(1/3))/2.\n\nBut θ must be between -π/2 and 0. So, (π + arcsin(1/3))/2 is positive, which is outside the range of θ (since θ is negative). Therefore, only θ = (-arcsin(1/3))/2 is valid here.\n\nTherefore, for x < 0, x = tan[ (-arcsin(1/3))/2 ].\n\nSo, in total, we have three solutions:\n\n1. x = tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] (from x > 0 case)\n\n2. x = tan[(π - arcsin(1/3))/2] (from x > 0 case)\n\n3. x = tan[ (-arcsin(1/3))/2 ] (from x < 0 case)\n\nBut perhaps these expressions can be simplified. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's compute tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)].\n\nLet’s denote α = arcsin(1/3). Then, sinα = 1/3, and α is in (0, π/2). Then, we can find tan(α/2). Using the identity tan(α/2) = sinα / (1 + cosα).\n\nSince sinα = 1/3, cosα = sqrt(1 - sin²α) = sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = 2√2/3.\n\nTherefore, tan(α/2) = (1/3) / (1 + 2√2/3) = (1/3) / ( (3 + 2√2)/3 ) = 1 / (3 + 2√2).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n\n1 / (3 + 2√2) = (3 - 2√2) / [ (3 + 2√2)(3 - 2√2) ] = (3 - 2√2) / (9 - 8) = (3 - 2√2)/1 = 3 - 2√2.\n\nSo, tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] = 3 - 2√2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute tan[(π - arcsin(1/3))/2].\n\nLet’s denote β = π - arcsin(1/3). Then, β is in (π/2, π). So, β/2 is in (π/4, π/2). Let's compute tan(β/2).\n\ntan(β/2) = sinβ / (1 + cosβ). But β = π - α, where α = arcsin(1/3). So, sinβ = sin(π - α) = sinα = 1/3. cosβ = cos(π - α) = -cosα = -2√2/3.\n\nTherefore, tan(β/2) = (1/3) / (1 - 2√2/3) = (1/3) / ( (3 - 2√2)/3 ) = 1 / (3 - 2√2).\n\nAgain, rationalizing the denominator:\n\n1 / (3 - 2√2) = (3 + 2√2) / [ (3 - 2√2)(3 + 2√2) ] = (3 + 2√2)/ (9 - 8) = 3 + 2√2.\n\nTherefore, tan[(π - arcsin(1/3))/2] = 3 + 2√2.\n\nNow, for the x < 0 case: x = tan[ (-arcsin(1/3))/2 ].\n\nLet’s compute this. Let’s denote γ = -arcsin(1/3). Then, γ is in (-π/2, 0). So, γ/2 is in (-π/4, 0). Let's compute tan(γ/2).\n\ntan(γ/2) = sinγ / (1 + cosγ). But γ = -α, so sinγ = -sinα = -1/3, cosγ = cosα = 2√2/3.\n\nTherefore, tan(γ/2) = (-1/3) / (1 + 2√2/3) = (-1/3) / ( (3 + 2√2)/3 ) = -1 / (3 + 2√2).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\n-1 / (3 + 2√2) = (-3 + 2√2) / [ (3 + 2√2)(-3 + 2√2) ] = (-3 + 2√2)/ ( (2√2)^2 - 3^2 ) = Wait, denominator is (3 + 2√2)(-3 + 2√2) = (2√2)^2 - 3^2 = 8 - 9 = -1. So, numerator is -3 + 2√2. So, (-3 + 2√2)/(-1) = 3 - 2√2.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (-3 + 2√2):\n\nDenominator: (3 + 2√2)(-3 + 2√2) = (-9 + 6√2 -6√2 + 8) = (-9 + 8) + (6√2 -6√2) = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\nNumerator: (-1)(-3 + 2√2) = 3 - 2√2.\n\nTherefore, tan(γ/2) = (3 - 2√2)/(-1) = -3 + 2√2.\n\nWait, but tan(γ/2) was calculated as -1/(3 + 2√2). Then, after rationalizing, we get -3 + 2√2. But let me verify:\n\nWait, tan(γ/2) = -1/(3 + 2√2). Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2√2):\n\n-1*(3 - 2√2) / [ (3 + 2√2)(3 - 2√2) ] = (-3 + 2√2)/ (9 - 8) ) = (-3 + 2√2)/1 = -3 + 2√2. So, indeed, tan(γ/2) = -3 + 2√2. But wait, γ is negative, so γ/2 is negative. Therefore, tan(γ/2) is negative, which matches the result. So, x = tan(γ/2) = -3 + 2√2. But -3 + 2√2 is approximately -3 + 2.828 ≈ -0.172, which is negative. So that's valid for x < 0.\n\nTherefore, the three solutions are:\n\nx = 3 - 2√2,\n\nx = 3 + 2√2,\n\nx = -3 + 2√2.\n\nWait, but let me check if these are all distinct. 3 - 2√2 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172,\n\n3 + 2√2 ≈ 5.828,\n\n-3 + 2√2 ≈ -0.172.\n\nSo, yes, three distinct solutions. Now, let me confirm that these satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, check x = 3 - 2√2 (positive). Let's compute sin(arctan(3 - 2√2) + arccot(1/(3 - 2√2))).\n\nBut since x > 0, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). So, the argument becomes arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). So, sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3. Which is exactly how we derived it. So, 3 - 2√2 is a solution.\n\nSimilarly, x = 3 + 2√2 (positive). Then, 2 arctan(x) would have sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3. Correct.\n\nFor x = -3 + 2√2 (negative). Then, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. So, the argument is arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π. Then, sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = -sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3, so sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.

The problem says they are parallel, which is good because if they weren't, the distance would be harder to calculate. Since they are parallel, the distance should be the same along the entire length of the lines. Let me recall how to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space.\n\nFirst, the lines are given in parametric form. The first line is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAnd the second line is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the direction vectors of both lines are scalar multiples of each other. For the first line, the direction vector is (2, -9, -2), and for the second, it's (4, -18, -4). If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get (4, -18, -4), which is exactly the direction vector of the second line. So that confirms they are parallel because their direction vectors are scalar multiples.\n\nNow, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that you can take a vector connecting any two points on the lines (one from each) and then project it onto the direction perpendicular to the lines. Since the lines are parallel, the direction of the lines is the same, so the perpendicular direction would be the cross product of the direction vector with the vector connecting the two points. Alternatively, another formula I might remember is that the distance is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of the vector connecting the two points and the direction vectors, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between two parallel lines can be calculated by taking a vector between a point on each line and then finding the component of that vector perpendicular to the direction of the lines. Since the lines are parallel, the distance is constant and can be found using the formula:\n\nDistance = |(b - a) · (n)| / |n|\n\nWhere 'n' is the unit vector perpendicular to the lines, and (b - a) is the vector connecting any two points on the lines. But since the lines are parallel, the cross product of their direction vector with any vector not parallel to it would give a vector perpendicular to both. Wait, maybe it's better to use the cross product.\n\nLet me recall the formula. If you have two parallel lines, the distance between them is equal to the length of the vector connecting them (from one line to the other) projected onto a line perpendicular to both. Since they are parallel, the cross product of their direction vectors would give a vector perpendicular to both. So, the distance should be the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point from each line, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me check.\n\nSuppose line 1 has direction vector **v** and line 2 has direction vector **w**. Since they are parallel, **v** = k**w** for some scalar k. Then, the cross product **v** × **w** would be zero, but since they are parallel, the cross product is zero. But actually, since they are parallel, they lie on the same plane? Wait, no. In 3D space, two parallel lines can be skew or parallel. But in this problem, they are stated to be parallel, so they are either coincident or parallel and distinct. Since they are given as two different lines, they must be parallel and distinct. Therefore, the distance between them is the minimal distance between any two points on the lines.\n\nTo compute that, the formula is indeed using the cross product. The distance is |( **b** - **a** ) · ( **v** × **w** )| / |**v** × **w**|, where **a** is a point on line 1, **b** is a point on line 2, and **v**, **w** are direction vectors of the lines. But since the lines are parallel, **v** × **w** is zero, but that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if the lines are parallel, then their direction vectors are scalar multiples, so **v** × **w** would be zero. But then the formula would involve division by zero, which is undefined. So maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps when the lines are parallel, the distance is calculated differently. Let me check my notes.\n\nYes, for parallel lines, the distance can be calculated by taking the magnitude of the vector connecting a point on one line to the other line, and then taking the component of that vector perpendicular to the direction of the lines. Since the lines are parallel, the direction vector is the same for both. So, if I take a vector from a point on line 1 to a point on line 2, and then subtract the component of that vector in the direction of the lines, the remaining component is perpendicular, and its magnitude is the distance.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\nDistance = |( **b** - **a** ) × **v**| / |**v**|\n\nWhere **a** and **b** are points on line 1 and line 2, respectively, and **v** is the direction vector of the lines.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because ( **b** - **a** ) × **v** gives a vector whose magnitude is equal to | **b** - **a** | * | **v** | * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between ( **b** - **a** ) and **v**. Then dividing by | **v** | gives | **b** - **a** | * sin(theta), which is the length of the component of ( **b** - **a** ) perpendicular to **v**, which is the distance between the lines.\n\nOkay, so let's apply this formula.\n\nFirst, let's take **a** as the point (3, -10, 1) from the first line, and **b** as the point (-5, -3, 6) from the second line. Then **b** - **a** is:\n\n(-5 - 3, -3 - (-10), 6 - 1) = (-8, 7, 5)\n\nThen, the direction vector **v** is (2, -9, -2). Wait, the direction vector for both lines is the same, but since they are scalar multiples, we can use either one. Let's use (2, -9, -2) for **v**.\n\nCompute the cross product ( **b** - **a** ) × **v**:\n\nFirst, write down ( **b** - **a** ) as (-8, 7, 5) and **v** as (2, -9, -2).\n\nThe cross product is:\n\n|i     j     k|\n|-8   7     5|\n|2   -9   -2|\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\ni*(7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) - j*(-8*(-2) - 5*2) + k*(-8*(-9) - 7*2)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni*( -14 + 45 ) - j*( 16 - 10 ) + k*( 72 - 14 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ni*(31) - j*(6) + k*(58)\n\nSo the cross product is (31, -6, 58)\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is:\n\n√(31² + (-6)² + 58²) = √(961 + 36 + 3364) = √(961 + 36 is 997, 997 + 3364 is 4361)\n\nSo √4361. Let me check that calculation again:\n\n31² = 961\n\n(-6)² = 36\n\n58² = 3364\n\n961 + 36 = 997\n\n997 + 3364 = 4361. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the magnitude of **v** is √(2² + (-9)² + (-2)²) = √(4 + 81 + 4) = √89.\n\nTherefore, the distance is |( **b** - **a** ) × **v**| / |**v**| = √4361 / √89.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n√(4361 / 89). Let's compute 4361 divided by 89.\n\nFirst, check if 89 divides into 4361.\n\nCompute 89 * 49 = 89 * 50 - 89 = 4450 - 89 = 4361. Exactly.\n\nSo 4361 / 89 = 49.\n\nTherefore, √49 = 7.\n\nSo the distance is 7.\n\nWait, that's a nice number. Let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Calculated **b** - **a** correctly: (-8,7,5). Correct.\n\n2. Direction vector **v** is (2, -9, -2). Correct.\n\n3. Cross product calculation:\n\ni*(7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) = i*(-14 + 45) = 31i\n\nj component: - [ (-8)*(-2) - 5*2 ] = - [16 - 10] = -6j\n\nk component: (-8)*(-9) - 7*2 = 72 - 14 = 58k\n\nSo cross product is (31, -6, 58). Correct.\n\nMagnitude squared: 31² + (-6)² +58² = 961 + 36 + 3364 = 4361. Correct.\n\nMagnitude of **v**: √(4 + 81 + 4) = √89. Correct.\n\n4361 divided by 89 is 49. So √49 is 7. Therefore, the distance is 7. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try using another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to compute the distance between two parallel lines is to take any vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line, and then compute the distance as the norm of the projection of this vector onto the plane perpendicular to the lines. Since the lines are parallel, the normal vector to the lines is the cross product of their direction vector with any other vector not colinear.\n\nBut since we already have the cross product method giving 7, and the calculation checks out, I think 7 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's an alternative formula or if I might have confused it with something else.\n\nAlternatively, if the lines are given by their parametric equations, and they are parallel, then the distance can also be calculated by finding the minimal distance between any two points on the lines. But since they are parallel, the minimal distance occurs along the common perpendicular. The formula using the cross product is the standard way to compute this, and since we arrived at 7 through that method, and the steps are correct, I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two parallel lines is 7 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe distance between the two parallel lines is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by noting that the direction vectors of both lines are scalar multiples of each other, confirming they are parallel.

I need to find how many integer coordinate points are strictly inside this rectangle. The rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). Hmm, first, I should visualize this rectangle. Since the x-coordinates go from -5 to 5 and the y-coordinates from -4 to 4, right? So the rectangle is centered at the origin, symmetric in both x and y directions.\n\nNow, the problem says \"strictly inside,\" which means the points on the boundary (edges or vertices) don't count. So I need to count all the integer points (x, y) where x is between -5 and 5, but not including -5 and 5, and similarly y between -4 and 4, excluding the endpoints.\n\nWait, let me confirm the boundaries. The rectangle is defined by those four vertices. So the edges are the lines connecting these points. For the x-coordinates, from (5,4) to (-5,4) is the top edge, then to (-5,-4) is the bottom edge, and back to (5,-4) is the bottom edge. So the sides are vertical lines at x = 5 and x = -5, and horizontal lines at y = 4 and y = -4.\n\nSo for a point to be strictly inside, its x-coordinate must be greater than -5 and less than 5, and y-coordinate greater than -4 and less than 4. Since the coordinates are integers, x can be -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly, y can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if x has to be strictly between -5 and 5, then the integer x-values are from -4 up to 4. Because -5 is excluded and 5 is excluded. So that's 9 values: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly for y, strictly between -4 and 4. So y has to be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 values.\n\nSo the total number of integer points would be the number of x-values multiplied by the number of y-values. So 9 x 7 = 63. But wait, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, is that right? If x can be from -4 to 4 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. For y, from -3 to 3 inclusive, that's 7 numbers. So 9*7=63. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when counting points in a grid, it's helpful to use the formula for the number of integer points in a rectangle. The formula is (width - 1) * (height - 1), where width is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and height is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. But wait, in this case, the width is 5 - (-5) = 10, and the height is 4 - (-4) = 8. Then applying the formula (width - 1)*(height -1) = 9*7=63. So that's the same result. That seems to check out.\n\nBut let me verify with a small example to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Suppose we have a square from (0,0) to (2,2). The integer points strictly inside would be (1,1). So that's 1 point. Using the formula, width=2, height=2, so (2-1)*(2-1)=1*1=1. Correct. Another example: a rectangle from (0,0) to (3,3). The strictly inside points would be (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). That's 4 points. Using the formula, (3-1)*(3-1)=2*2=4. Correct. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, applying the formula here, (10-1)*(8-1)=9*7=63. So the answer should be 63. Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe the original rectangle is different?\n\nWait, the given rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4). So the length along the x-axis is from -5 to 5, which is 10 units, and along the y-axis from -4 to 4, which is 8 units. So the sides are 10 and 8 units long. Then the number of integer points strictly inside is (10-1)*(8-1)=9*7=63. Hmm. So that's the answer.\n\nBut let me think of another way. For each x from -4 to 4, inclusive, count the number of y's from -3 to 3, inclusive. So for each x, there are 7 y's. There are 9 x's. 9*7=63. Yes, that's the same.\n\nAlternatively, if I list the x's: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 numbers. For each x, the y ranges from -3 to 3. Let's count how many y's that is. From -3 to 3 inclusive is 7 numbers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So 7. So 9*7=63. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 63. But let me think again if there's any catch here. Sometimes when people say \"strictly inside,\" they might consider something else, but in standard terms, it's just the interior, not including the boundary. So the points where x is strictly between -5 and 5, and y strictly between -4 and 4. Since x and y are integers, the ranges are -4 to 4 for x and -3 to 3 for y, inclusive. So that's 9 x 7. So 63.\n\nWait, but let me check if maybe the original rectangle is not aligned with the axes? But the coordinates given are (5,4), (-5,4), etc. So that's a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes. Because the x-values go from -5 to 5, and y from -4 to 4. So it's a standard axis-aligned rectangle. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the definition of \"strictly inside.\" For example, in some contexts, \"strictly inside\" might mean excluding the edges, which is what we did. So the formula (width -1)*(height -1) is correct. So I think 63 is the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's take a small section of the grid and count manually. Let's say x from 0 to 4 and y from 0 to 3. So points (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), etc. For x=0, y=0,1,2,3: 4 points. x=1: same, 4 points. x=2: 4, x=3:4, x=4:4. So 5x4=20. Using the formula, width=5 (from 0 to4 inclusive), so width=5, height=4 (from0 to3), so (5-1)*(4-1)=4*3=12. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe my initial formula is wrong?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the original problem, the rectangle spans from x=-5 to x=5, which is a width of 10 units (5 - (-5) =10). But in the example I just made, x from 0 to4 is a width of 5 units (4 -0=4). So in that case, the number of integer x's would be 5 (0,1,2,3,4). So according to the formula (width -1)*(height -1), the number of interior points would be (5-1)*(4-1)=4*3=12. But when I counted manually, I got 20. Wait, this discrepancy is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the formula isn't (width -1)*(height -1). Wait, actually, the formula is (number of x-values -1)*(number of y-values -1). Wait, in the original problem, the x-values are from -5 to 5 inclusive. The number of x-values is 11: from -5 to5 is 11 numbers. So (11-1)*(number of y-values -1). Wait, but in my manual example, x from0 to4 inclusive is 5 numbers (0,1,2,3,4). So (5-1)=4, which matches the formula's (width -1). But in the original problem, the width is 10 units (from -5 to5), but the number of x-values is 11 (since it's inclusive). So in that case, the formula would be (number of x-values -1)*(number of y-values -1). So in the original problem, number of x-values is 11, y-values is 9 (from -4 to4 inclusive). So (11-1)*(9-1)=10*8=80. But that contradicts the previous answer of 63.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. There's a conflict here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the formula (width -1)*(height -1) applies when the rectangle is aligned with the axes and the sides are at integer coordinates. Wait, actually, the formula is (number of x-integers -1)*(number of y-integers -1). Wait, no, the formula is (number of x-interior -1)*(number of y-interior -1). Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nSuppose the rectangle has left and right boundaries at x = a and x = b, with a < b. Then the number of integer x's strictly between a and b is (b - a -1). Similarly for y.\n\nIn the original problem, the left boundary is x=-5, right boundary x=5. So the number of integer x's strictly between -5 and5 is (5 - (-5) -1) =10 -1=9. Similarly, the bottom boundary is y=-4, top boundary y=4. The number of integer y's strictly between -4 and4 is (4 - (-4) -1)=8 -1=7. Therefore, total points is 9*7=63. That's the same as before.\n\nBut in my manual example, where x from0 to4 inclusive. That's 5 x-values. The left boundary is x=0, right boundary x=4. So the number of integer x's strictly between0 and4 is (4 -0 -1)=3. So (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Wait, no. Wait, if x is strictly between0 and4, then x can be1,2,3. So 3 values. But in my manual example, I considered x from0 to4 inclusive, which is 5 values, but strictly inside would be1,2,3. So 3 x's. If y is from0 to3 inclusive, then strictly inside y would be1,2. So 2 y's. So total points would be3*2=6. But when I counted manually, I thought it was 4 y's? Wait, no. Wait, if y from0 to3 inclusive, strictly inside would be y=1,2. So 2 values. So 3*2=6. But if I list them: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2). That's 6 points. But if I include x=0 and x=4, which are on the boundary, then x=0 and x=4 would be excluded. So indeed, 3 x's and 2 y's, 6 points. But if I had included x=0 and x=4, then it would be5 x's and 4 y's, 20 points, which is what I thought earlier. So the formula (number of x's strictly inside)*(number of y's strictly inside) gives the correct answer. So in that case, the formula is (right - left -1)*(top - bottom -1). So in the original problem, (5 - (-5) -1)*(4 - (-4) -1)= (10 -1)*(8 -1)=9*7=63. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63. Hmm, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I thought of the width as 10 units, but actually, the number of integer x's between -5 and5 exclusive is 9, not 10. Because from -4 to4 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. Wait, 4 - (-4) =8, but 8+1=9. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63. So I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integer points strictly inside the rectangle is \\boxed{63}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of integer coordinate points that lie strictly inside the given rectangle with vertices at \\((5,4)\\), \\((-5,4)\\), \\((-5,-4)\\), and \\((5,-4)\\), we need to consider the ranges for the \\(x\\)-coordinates and \\(y\\)-coordinates of points inside the rectangle.\n\n1. **Identify the ranges for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):**\n   - The \\(x\\)-coordinates must be strictly between \\(-5\\) and \\(5\\).

The cross product is distributive over vector addition and subtraction, but not over scalar multiplication in the same way. Wait, actually, scalar multiplication is compatible with cross products. Let me check.\n\nYes, the cross product is bilinear, which means that for scalars α and β, and vectors u, v, w, etc., we have:\n\nu × (αv + βw) = α(u × v) + β(u × w)\n\nSimilarly, (αu + βv) × w = α(u × w) + β(v × w)\n\nSo, applying that here, (2b - a) × (3c + a) can be expanded as:\n\nFirst, distribute the first term over the second:\n\n(2b × 3c) + (2b × a) - (a × 3c) - (a × a)\n\nWait, but cross product is anti-commutative, so a × a is zero. Right, because any vector crossed with itself is zero. So that last term is zero. So let's compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 2*3 (b × c) = 6 (b × c)\n\nSecond term: 2b × a\n\nThird term: -3 (a × c)\n\nFourth term: -a × a = 0\n\nSo combining these:\n\n6 (b × c) + 2 (b × a) - 3 (a × c)\n\nNow, note that cross product is anti-commutative, so b × a = - (a × b). Similarly, a × c is given. Let's substitute the known cross products.\n\nGiven:\n\na × b = [6, -7, 3]\n\nb × c = [1, -7, 18]\n\na × c = [4, 7, 2]\n\nTherefore:\n\nFirst term: 6 (b × c) = 6 * [1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term: 2 (b × a) = 2*(- (a × b)) = -2*(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term: -3 (a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6]\n\nNow, add all these three results together:\n\nFirst term: [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term: [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term: [-12, -21, -6]\n\nAdding the x-components: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 - 12 -12 = 6 - 24 = -18\n\nAdding the y-components: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 + 14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49\n\nAdding the z-components: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 96\n\nSo the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96]\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst term: 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108) correct.\n\nSecond term: -2*(6, -7, 3) = (-12, 14, -6) correct.\n\nThird term: -3*(4,7,2) = (-12, -21, -6) correct.\n\nNow, x-components:\n\n6 -12 -12: 6 -12 is -6, then -6 -12 is -18. Correct.\n\ny-components:\n\n-42 +14 -21: -42 +14 is -28, then -28 -21 is -49. Correct.\n\nz-components:\n\n108 -6 -6: 108 -12 is 96. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the final result is (-18, -49, 96). Therefore, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) is equal to that vector.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm once again if the expansion was correct. Because sometimes when dealing with cross products, the order matters. Let me double-check the expansion step.\n\nOriginal expression: (2b - a) × (3c + a)\n\nExpanding this, using distributive property:\n\n2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nYes, that's correct. Then scalar multiplication:\n\n6 (b × c) + 2 (b × a) -3 (a × c) -0\n\nThen, using anti-commutativity, b × a = -a × b, so 2 (b × a) = -2 (a × b). Correct.\n\nSubstituting the given cross products:\n\nYes, all steps seem okay. So the answer should be [-18, -49, 96]. Therefore, boxed, it's \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n</think>\n\nTo compute the cross product \\((2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a})\\), we use the distributive properties of the cross product. \n\nFirst, expand the expression:\n\\[\n(2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a}) = 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} + 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a}\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n- The cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{0}\\).\n- Using the anti-commutative property of the cross product, \\(\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} = -(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b})\\).\n\nSubstitute the given cross products:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n1. \\(6 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = 6 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n2. \\(-2 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}) = -2 \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n3. \\(-3 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = -3 \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nAdd the resulting vectors:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\\\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\\\ 108 - 6 - 6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]", "answer": "\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}"}

Zaokrouhlete svou odpověď na nejbližší desetinu centu.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Juan's stamp collection. He has stamps from different countries grouped by decades, and each country is from either South America (Brazílie and Peru) or Europe (France and Spain). The cost per stamp is given: 6c for Brazil and France, 4c for Peru, and 5c for Spain. The question is asking for the average cost per stamp in the 1970s, and we need to round it to the nearest tenth of a cent.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many stamps he has from each country in the 1970s and then calculate the total cost. Then, divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to get the average. Let me check the data from the Asymptote code they provided.\n\nLooking at the labels, the 1970s are on the leftmost column. The numbers for each country are:\n\n- Brazil (Brazílie): 12 stamps\n- France: 12 stamps\n- Peru: 6 stamps\n- Spain: 13 stamps\n\nWait, let me confirm the positions. The Asymptote code has labels for 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The vertical lines are for each decade. The horizontal labels for the countries are at the bottom. The numbers are above each country in each decade. So for the 70s:\n\n- Brazil: 12\n- France: 12\n- Peru: 6\n- Spain: 13\n\nYes, that's right. So the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s is Brazil:12, France:12, Peru:6, Spain:13.\n\nNow, the costs per stamp:\n\n- Brazil (6c) and France (6c): so Brazil and France are in South America, both 6c each.\n- Peru (4c): Perú is in South America.\n- Spain (5c): Spain is in Europe.\n\nSo for Brazil and France, each stamp is 6c. For Peru, each is 4c, and Spain is 5c.\n\nNow, let's compute the total cost for each country in the 1970s.\n\nStarting with Brazil: 12 stamps * 6c = 72c.\n\nFrance: 12 stamps * 6c = 72c.\n\nPeru: 6 stamps * 4c = 24c.\n\n Spain: 13 stamps * 5c = 65c.\n\nNow, sum all these up.\n\nTotal cost = 72 + 72 + 24 + 65.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n72 + 72 = 144\n\n144 + 24 = 168\n\n168 + 65 = 233c.\n\nTotal cost is 233 cents.\n\nTotal number of stamps is 12 + 12 + 6 + 13.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n12 + 12 = 24\n\n24 + 6 = 30\n\n30 + 13 = 43.\n\nSo 43 stamps in total.\n\nAverage cost per stamp is total cost divided by total number of stamps: 233 / 43.\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nFirst, 43 times 5 is 215.\n\n233 - 215 = 18.\n\nSo 5 with a remainder of 18.\n\nSo 18/43. Let's convert that to a decimal.\n\n18 ÷ 43.\n\nWell, 43 goes into 18 zero times. Add a decimal point and a zero: 180.\n\n43 goes into 180 four times (43*4=172). Subtract 172 from 180: 8.\n\nBring down another zero: 80.\n\n43 goes into 80 once (43*1=43). Subtract 43 from 80: 37.\n\nBring down another zero: 370.\n\n43 goes into 370 eight times (43*8=344). Subtract 344 from 370: 26.\n\nBring down another zero: 260.\n\n43 goes into 260 six times (43*6=258). Subtract 258 from 260: 2.\n\nBring down another zero: 20.\n\n43 goes into 20 zero times. So we have 0.\n\nBring down another zero: 200.\n\n43 goes into 200 four times (43*4=172). Subtract 172: 28.\n\nSo putting it all together: 5.41860465...\n\nSo approximately 5.4186 cents.\n\nThe question says to round to the nearest tenth of a cent. So we look at the hundredths place, which is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we round down. Therefore, 5.4 cents.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute 233 divided by 43 step by step to make sure.\n\n43 x 5 = 215, as before.\n\n233 - 215 = 18. So 5.418... So yes, 5.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another method. Maybe using fractions.\n\n233 divided by 43:\n\n43*5 = 215, remainder 18.\n\nSo 5 + 18/43.\n\n18/43 as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n18 ÷ 43.\n\n43 )18.0000\n\n43 goes into 180 4 times (4*43=172), remainder 8.\n\n80 (from 18.0000) 4*43=172, but wait, 43 into 80 is 1 (1*43=43), remainder 37.\n\n370 (from 80.000... becomes 370 after bringing down next 0) 43*8=344, remainder 26.\n\n260 (from 370 becomes 260 after bringing down another 0) 43*6=258, remainder 2.\n\n20 (from 260 becomes 20 after bringing down next 0) 0, so 20.\n\n200 (from 20 becomes 200 after bringing down next 0) 43*4=172, remainder 28.\n\n280 (from 200 becomes 280 after bringing down next 0) 43*6=258, remainder 22.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again:\n\nStarting with 18.000000...\n\n43 ) 18.000000\n\nFirst division: 43 into 180 (18.0 becomes 180.0 when adding a decimal point and a zero). 43*4=172. 180-172=8. Bring down a zero: 80.\n\n43 into 80: 1 time (43*1=43). 80-43=37. Bring down a zero: 370.\n\n43 into 370: 8 times (43*8=344). 370-344=26. Bring down a zero: 260.\n\n43 into 260: 6 times (43*6=258). 260-258=2. Bring down a zero: 20.\n\n43 into 20: 0 times. Bring down a zero: 200.\n\n43 into 200: 4 times (43*4=172). 200-172=28. Bring down a zero: 280.\n\n43 into 280: 6 times (43*6=258). 280-258=22. Bring down a zero: 220.\n\n43 into 220: 5 times (43*5=215). 220-215=5. Bring down a zero: 50.\n\n43 into 50: 1 time (43*1=43). 50-43=7. Bring down a zero: 70.\n\n43 into 70: 1 time (43*1=43). 70-43=27. Bring down a zero: 270.\n\n43 into 270: 6 times (43*6=258). 270-258=12. Bring down a zero: 120.\n\n43 into 120: 2 times (43*2=86). 120-86=34. Bring down a zero: 340.\n\n43 into 340: 7 times (43*7=301). 340-301=39. Bring down a zero: 390.\n\n43 into 390: 9 times (43*9=387). 390-387=3. Bring down a zero: 30.\n\nSo at this point, we can see the decimal is repeating. So the decimal expansion is 0.418604651163..., which is approximately 0.4186...\n\nSo 5.4186... So when rounding to the nearest tenth, the first digit after the decimal is 4, and the next is 1. Since 1 < 5, we round down. Therefore, 5.4 cents.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per stamp in the 1970s is 5.4 cents.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more if I added correctly the total number of stamps and the total cost.\n\nTotal stamps:\n\nBrazil:12, France:12, Peru:6, Spain:13.\n\n12+12=24, 24+6=30, 30+13=43. Correct.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nBrazil:12*6=72, France:12*6=72, Peru:6*4=24, Spain:13*5=65.\n\n72+72=144, 144+24=168, 168+65=233. Correct.\n\nSo 233/43=5.418... So yes, 5.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.4 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average cost per stamp in the 1970s for Juan's collection, we first calculate the total cost of stamps from each country and then divide by the total number of stamps.\n\n**Number of stamps per country in the 1970s:**\n- **Brazil (Brazílie):** 12 stamps\n- **France:** 12 stamps\n- **Peru:** 6 stamps\n- **Spain:** 13 stamps\n\n**Cost per stamp:**\n- **Brazílie and France:** 6 cents each\n- **Peru:** 4 cents\n- **Spain:** 5 cents\n\n**Total cost calculation:**\n- **Brazil:** \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\) cents\n- **France:** \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\) cents\n- **Peru:** \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) cents\n- **Spain:** \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\) cents\n\n**Summing the total cost:**\n\\[\n72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n**Total number of stamps:**\n\\[\n12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43\n\\]\n\n**Average cost per stamp:**\n\\[\n\\frac{233}{43} \\approx 5.4186 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nRounding 5.4186 to the nearest tenth of a cent gives **5.4 cents**.\n\n\\boxed{5.4}", "answer": "5.4 \\text{ cents}"}

Also, \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), meaning \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle CAD\\).\n\nLet's denote \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle CAD = \\theta\\). Since \\(AC\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), \\(\\angle ACD = 90^\\circ\\). Therefore, in \\(\\triangle ACD\\), \\(\\angle CAD = \\theta\\) and \\(\\angle ACD = 90^\\circ\\), so the remaining angle \\(\\angle ADC = 90^\\circ - \\theta\\).\n\nIn \\(\\triangle ABC\\), since \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), \\(\\angle BAC = \\theta\\). However, \\(ABCD\\) is a trapezoid with \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), so \\(\\angle ABC\\) and \\(\\angle BAD\\) are supplementary. Wait, no, in a trapezoid with \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So \\(\\angle BAD + \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ\\). But since \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\) into two angles of \\(\\theta\\), then \\(\\angle BAC = \\theta\\) and \\(\\angle CAD = \\theta\\). Then \\(\\angle BAD = 2\\theta\\), so \\(\\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - 2\\theta\\).\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe we can use the properties of the trapezoid and the triangles formed by the diagonal \\(AC\\).\n\nSince \\(AC \\perp CD\\), \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is a right triangle with legs \\(AC\\) and \\(CD\\), and hypotenuse \\(AD\\). Wait, no, \\(AC\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), so in \\(\\triangle ACD\\), \\(AC\\) is one leg, \\(CD\\) is the other leg, and \\(AD\\) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times CD\\).\n\nSimilarly, the area of trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\), or as the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. However, the height here is not directly given. But since \\(AC \\perp CD\\), maybe \\(AC\\) can serve as a height for some triangles.\n\nWait, but \\(AC\\) is a diagonal, not necessarily the height of the trapezoid. The height of the trapezoid would be the distance between the two bases \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\). Let's denote this height as \\(h\\). Then the area of the trapezoid is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (AD + BC) \\times h = 42\\).\n\nBut how does \\(AC\\) relate to this height? Since \\(AC\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), and \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), maybe we can use some trigonometric relations or similar triangles.\n\nLet me try to draw the trapezoid. Let me place point \\(D\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), and since \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), let me assume \\(AD\\) is horizontal. Then point \\(A\\) would be at \\((a, 0)\\) for some \\(a > 0\\). Since \\(AC\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), and \\(CD\\) is a leg of the trapezoid, which connects \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). Let's denote point \\(C\\) as \\((c, h')\\) but since \\(AC \\perp CD\\), maybe coordinates can help here.\n\nWait, perhaps coordinate geometry might be a good approach here. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s set coordinate system with point \\(D\\) at \\((0, 0)\\). Since \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), let's assume \\(AD\\) is along the x-axis. So point \\(A\\) is at \\((k, 0)\\) for some \\(k > 0\\). Then, since \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), and \\(BC\\) is the other base, point \\(B\\) must be somewhere above point \\(C\\). Let’s denote point \\(C\\) as \\((m, n)\\). Then point \\(B\\) would be at \\((m + p, n)\\) for some \\(p\\), since \\(BC\\) is parallel to \\(AD\\). However, since \\(ABCD\\) is a trapezoid with \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), the coordinates need to be set such that sides \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are the legs.\n\nBut maybe it's better to set \\(AD\\) along the x-axis from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((a,0)\\), and \\(BC\\) parallel to \\(AD\\), so \\(B\\) is at \\((b, h)\\) and \\(C\\) is at \\((c, h)\\) for some height \\(h\\). Then, since \\(AC\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), the vector \\(AC\\) is \\((c - a, h)\\) and vector \\(CD\\) is \\((-c, -h)\\). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular:\n\n\\[\n(c - a)(-c) + h(-h) = 0 \\\\\n-c(c - a) - h^2 = 0 \\\\\n-c^2 + a c - h^2 = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nSo that's one equation.\n\nAlso, \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\). Let's compute the angles. The angle \\(\\angle BAD\\) is the angle at point \\(A\\) between \\(BA\\) and \\(AD\\). The bisector of this angle is \\(AC\\). So using the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. That is, in \\(\\triangle BAD\\), the angle bisector \\(AC\\) divides \\(BD\\) into segments proportional to \\(AB\\) and \\(AD\\). Wait, but \\(AC\\) is a diagonal, not a segment on \\(BD\\). Maybe this is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), the direction vector of \\(AC\\) should be such that the angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AB\\) is equal to the angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AD\\). Let's express this in terms of coordinates.\n\nPoint \\(A\\) is \\((a, 0)\\). The vector \\(AD\\) is from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\), which is \\((-a, 0)\\). The vector \\(AB\\) is from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), which is \\((b - a, h)\\). The vector \\(AC\\) is from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\), which is \\((c - a, h)\\).\n\nThe angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AD\\) should be equal to the angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AB\\). Using the dot product formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors:\n\nFor angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AD\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{AC \\cdot AD}{|AC| |AD|}\n\\]\n\n\\(AC \\cdot AD = (c - a)(-a) + h \\cdot 0 = -a(c - a)\\)\n\n\\(|AC| = \\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2}\\)\n\n\\(|AD| = a\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{-a(c - a)}{a \\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2}} = \\frac{-(c - a)}{\\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2}}\n\\]\n\nFor angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(AB\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{AC \\cdot AB}{|AC| |AB|}\n\\]\n\n\\(AC \\cdot AB = (c - a)(b - a) + h \\cdot h = (c - a)(b - a) + h^2\\)\n\n\\(|AB| = \\sqrt{(b - a)^2 + h^2}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{(c - a)(b - a) + h^2}{\\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2} \\sqrt{(b - a)^2 + h^2}}\n\\]\n\nSince these two expressions for \\(\\cos \\theta\\) must be equal,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-(c - a)}{\\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2}} = \\frac{(c - a)(b - a) + h^2}{\\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2} \\sqrt{(b - a)^2 + h^2}}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\sqrt{(c - a)^2 + h^2}\\):\n\n\\[\n-(c - a) = \\frac{(c - a)(b - a) + h^2}{\\sqrt{(b - a)^2 + h^2}}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n(c - a)^2 = \\frac{[(c - a)(b - a) + h^2]^2}{(b - a)^2 + h^2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\((b - a)^2 + h^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(c - a)^2 [(b - a)^2 + h^2] = [(c - a)(b - a) + h^2]^2\n\\]\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n(c - a)^2 (b - a)^2 + (c - a)^2 h^2\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n[(c - a)(b - a)]^2 + 2(c - a)(b - a) h^2 + h^4\n\\]\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n\\[\n[(c - a)^2 (b - a)^2 + 2(c - a)(b - a) h^2 + h^4] - [(c - a)^2 (b - a)^2 + (c - a)^2 h^2] = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n2(c - a)(b - a) h^2 + h^4 - (c - a)^2 h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(h^2\\):\n\n\\[\nh^2 [2(c - a)(b - a) + h^2 - (c - a)^2] = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(h \\neq 0\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n2(c - a)(b - a) + h^2 - (c - a)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n\\[\n- (c - a)^2 + 2(c - a)(b - a) + h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(-(c - a)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(c - a)^2 [-1 + \\frac{2(b - a)}{c - a} ] + h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(AC \\perp CD\\), triangle \\(ACD\\) is right-angled at \\(C\\). So area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times CD\\).\n\nSimilarly, the area of the trapezoid can be written as the sum of the areas of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\). But we need to relate these areas.\n\nBut how to find the ratio between the areas?\n\nAlternatively, since \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. In triangle \\(BAD\\), the angle bisector is \\(AC\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{BC}{CD}\n\\]\n\nWait, angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But in this case, \\(AC\\) is the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAD\\) in triangle \\(BAD\\), but \\(AC\\) is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe this is not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to consider triangle \\(ABD\\). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(AC\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), and \\(AC \\perp CD\\), maybe we can use trigonometric identities. Let's denote \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle CAD = \\theta\\). Then in triangle \\(ACD\\), which is right-angled at \\(C\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\frac{CD}{AC}\n\\]\n\nBut also, in triangle \\(ABC\\), we can relate the angles. Since \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), the angle at \\(B\\) is supplementary to \\(\\angle BAD\\). So \\(\\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - 2\\theta\\). However, triangle \\(ABC\\) is not necessarily a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, consider the coordinates again. Let's try to assign coordinates more carefully.\n\nLet’s place point \\(D\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), point \\(A\\) at \\((a, 0)\\). Since \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), and \\(AD\\) is from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((a,0)\\), then \\(BC\\) must be a horizontal line. Let’s denote point \\(C\\) as \\((c, h)\\), so point \\(B\\) would be at \\((c, h)\\) as well? Wait, no. If \\(BC\\) is parallel to \\(AD\\), which is horizontal, then \\(BC\\) must also be horizontal. So if point \\(C\\) is at \\((c, h)\\), then point \\(B\\) must be at \\((c + k, h)\\) for some \\(k\\). But since \\(ABCD\\) is a trapezoid, the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are the legs.\n\nBut maybe assigning coordinates complicates things. Let's try another approach.\n\nSince \\(AC \\perp CD\\), triangle \\(ACD\\) is right-angled. Let’s denote \\(AC = x\\), \\(CD = y\\), so the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}xy\\).\n\nThe area of the trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) is 42, which can be written as \\", "answer": "28"}

I need to solve for x. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, maybe I can simplify the equation by getting rid of the square roots. To do that, I can square both sides of the equation. That should help me eliminate the denominators and the square roots. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n√(2x) / √(3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nIf I square both sides, the left side becomes (√(2x))² divided by (√(3x - 1))², which simplifies to (2x)/(3x - 1). The right side squared is (3/2)², which is 9/4. So now the equation is:\n\n(2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.\n\nOkay, that looks better. Now I can solve this rational equation. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. Multiply both sides by (3x - 1) and by 4 to eliminate the denominators. Let's do that.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4(3x - 1):\n4(3x - 1) * (2x)/(3x - 1) = 4(3x - 1) * (9/4).\n\nOn the left side, (3x - 1) cancels out, leaving 4*2x = 8x. On the right side, the 4 cancels out, leaving 9(3x - 1). So now the equation is:\n\n8x = 9(3x - 1).\n\nLet me expand the right side. 9 times 3x is 27x, and 9 times -1 is -9. So:\n\n8x = 27x - 9.\n\nNow, subtract 27x from both sides to get the x terms on one side:\n\n8x - 27x = -9.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n-19x = -9.\n\nDivide both sides by -19:\n\nx = (-9)/(-19) = 9/19.\n\nWait, so x is 9/19? Let me check if that makes sense. I need to plug it back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, compute 2x when x = 9/19. That's 2*(9/19) = 18/19. The square root of 18/19 is √(18)/√19. Then, compute 3x - 1 when x = 9/19. That's 3*(9/19) - 1 = 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. The square root of 8/19 is √8/√19.\n\nSo the original equation becomes (√(18)/√19) / (√8/√19) = (√18 / √19) * (√19 / √8) = √18 / √8. Simplify that: √(18/8) = √(9/4) = 3/2. Which is exactly the right side of the equation. So that checks out. Therefore, x = 9/19 is indeed the solution.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nSquare both sides: (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.\n\nCross-multiplied: 8x = 27x - 9.\n\nSubtract 27x: -19x = -9 → x = 9/19. Yep, that seems right. And when I checked, it works. So I think that's the correct answer. \n\nI wonder if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe rationalizing the denominator first? Let's try that.\n\nOriginal equation: √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(3x - 1) to rationalize the denominator:\n\n√(2x) * √(3x - 1) / (3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nBut that gives √[2x(3x - 1)] / (3x - 1) = 3/2. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe squaring both sides again would get back to the same equation. So perhaps the first method was the right way. Either way, both methods lead to the same equation after squaring. So yeah, x = 9/19 is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let me compute 2x and 3x -1 when x = 9/19.\n\n2x = 18/19 ≈ 0.947, and 3x -1 = 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19 ≈ 0.421. Then the square roots are √(0.947) ≈ 0.973 and √(0.421) ≈ 0.649. Then 0.973 / 0.649 ≈ 1.5, which is 3/2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that x = 9/19 is the solution. The answer is already in the simplest fractional form, so no need to reduce it further.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{19}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nwe start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, we cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 2x = 9 \\cdot (3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n8x = 27x - 9\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 27x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-19x = -9\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( -19 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{19}\n\\]\n\nWe verify the solution by substituting \\( x = \\frac{9}{19} \\) back into the original equation.

The question is asking for the simplified value of (7/30) @ (10/21). Hmm, let me make sure I understand the definition correctly. \n\nFirst, the operation @ takes two fractions in simplified form, m/n and p/q. Then, when you perform the @ operation, you multiply the numerators (m * p), the denominators are involved in a different way: n is in the denominator of the second fraction, but here in the formula, it's multiplied by q/n. Wait, let me parse that again. The definition says (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). So, the result is the product of m, p, and q divided by n. \n\nWait, but p/q is a simplified fraction. So, p and q are coprime. Similarly, m/n is also simplified. So, in the given problem, we have (7/30) @ (10/21). Let me identify m, n, p, q here. \n\nFor the first fraction, 7/30, m is 7 and n is 30. For the second fraction, 10/21, p is 10 and q is 21. According to the definition, the result should be (m * p * q) / n. Plugging in the numbers: (7 * 10 * 21) / 30. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, multiply 7 * 10. That's 70. Then, multiply 70 * 21. Let me do 70 * 20 first, which is 1400, plus 70 * 1, which is 70. So, 1400 + 70 = 1470. Then, divide that by 30. So, 1470 divided by 30. Let's see, 30 goes into 1470 how many times? 30*40=1200, subtract 1200 from 1470, we get 270. Then, 30*9=270. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 1470 / 30 = 49. Therefore, the result is 49. \n\nBut wait, the problem says to provide the simplified value. However, 49 is an integer, so it's already simplified. But let me check if there's any possibility of a mistake here. Let me verify each step again. \n\nOriginal operation: (7/30) @ (10/21) = (7 * 10 * 21) / 30. Let's compute numerator: 7*10=70, 70*21. Let's do 70*20=1400, 70*1=70, so 1400+70=1470. Denominator: 30. So 1470 divided by 30. \n\nDividing 1470 by 30: 30*40=1200, 1470-1200=270. 30*9=270. So total is 40+9=49. Yes, that seems correct. So the result is 49, which is already an integer, so it can't be simplified further. \n\nBut wait, let me check if the operation definition is correct. The problem says \"zjed Defines Vladimír Pecíř\" – no, the user probably meant \"zjedné\" which is \"simplified\". So, the operation is defined for simplified fractions. So, both inputs are simplified. Then, the formula is (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m * p * q) / n. \n\nWait, in the definition, the formula is (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). So, the formula is m * p * (q / n). So, q/n is multiplied by m and p. \n\nBut q/n is (q/n) which is a fraction, so when you multiply by m and p, you get (m * p * q) / n. So, that's correct. \n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: 7 * 10 * 21 / 30. Let's see if there's a way to simplify before multiplying to reduce the calculation. Let's see if any factors can be canceled out. \n\nLooking at 7, 10, 21, and 30. \n\nFirst, 21 and 30 have a common factor. 21 is 3*7, 30 is 3*10. So, 21/30 = 7/10. Therefore, 21/30 can be simplified, but in the formula, we have 21 in the numerator and 30 in the denominator. So, the 21 and 30 can be simplified. \n\nSo, (7 * 10 * 21) / 30. Let's write it as (7 * 10) * (21 / 30). 21/30 simplifies to 7/10. Therefore, (7 * 10) * (7/10). \n\nWait, that's (7 * 10) * 7 / 10. The 10 in the numerator and the 10 in the denominator cancel out, leaving 7 * 7 = 49. So, same result, but by simplifying first. So, this shows that the operation can be simplified by cancelling common factors. \n\nSo, this cross-canceling gives the same answer. Therefore, the simplified value is indeed 49. \n\nAlternatively, another way: since 7 and 30 are coprime (7 is prime, doesn't divide 30), and 10 and 21 are coprime (10 and 21 share no common factors). So, when we multiply numerators and denominators, we have to see if factors can be canceled. \n\nBut in the formula, it's (7 * 10 * 21) / 30. Let's break it down:\n\nNumerator: 7 * 10 * 21 = 7 * 10 * 3 * 7 = 7^2 * 3 * 10\n\nDenominator: 30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n\nSo, numerator factors: 7^2 * 3 * 2 * 5 (since 10 is 2*5)\n\nDenominator factors: 2 * 3 * 5\n\nTherefore, when we divide, we can cancel out the common factors in numerator and denominator:\n\nCancel 2: 7^2 * 3 * 5 in numerator, denominator has 2 * 3 * 5. So, cancel one 2, one 3, and one 5.\n\nLeft with numerator: 7^2 = 49\n\nDenominator: 1\n\nTherefore, 49/1 = 49. \n\nSo, that's another way to see it, breaking down into prime factors and simplifying. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 49, which is an integer and already simplified. \n\nI think that's thorough.

What is the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect?\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think. First, I need to recall how chords intersect on a circle. If two chords intersect, the four endpoints must be arranged such that one chord connects two points, and the other chord connects the other two, but in a way that they cross each other inside the circle. So, for example, if the points are labeled in order around the circle as A, B, C, D, then the chords AC and BD would intersect. Wait, but does that always happen?\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let me visualize a circle with four points. If the points are placed in the order A, B, C, D around the circumference, then chords AB and CD would not intersect because AB is adjacent and CD skips over some points. But if the points are arranged such that when you connect AB and CD, the lines cross each other inside the circle. So, for intersection to occur, the four points must form a quadrilateral where the chords are the two diagonals. So, in other words, if the four points are in cyclic order, say, A, C, B, D, then the chords AC and BD would intersect. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.\n\nSuppose the four points are on a circle. If we pick four points at random, the order around the circle is random. For the chords AB and CD to intersect, they must form a crossing. So, in terms of the order of the points, the chords intersect if and only if the four points are interleaved when you go around the circle. That is, if the points are arranged as A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C or some rotation of that. Wait, actually, if the points are arranged such that one chord connects two points with one point in between, and the other chord connects the other two points with the other point in between. Wait, maybe another way to think about it is that for two chords to intersect, the four points must be arranged in such a way that one chord's endpoints are interleaved with the other chord's endpoints.\n\nSo, for example, if the points are labeled in order around the circle as A, B, C, D, then chords AC and BD intersect. But if the order is A, C, B, D, then chords AB and CD would intersect? Wait, let me check.\n\nIf the order is A, C, B, D, then chord AB would connect A and B, skipping C, and chord CD would connect C and D. Do these intersect? Hmm, if A is first, then C, then B, then D. So chord AB is from A (first) to B (third), and chord CD is from C (second) to D (fourth). So they don't cross. Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, if the points are arranged as A, B, C, D around the circle, then chord AB is adjacent, chord CD skips over B and C. So they don't intersect. But if the order is A, C, B, D, then chord AC connects A and C, passing through the other side of the circle, and chord BD connects B and D. Do those intersect? Let me see. If A is at the top, C is to the bottom right, B is to the bottom left, and D is back to the top. Then chord AC is a diagonal from top to bottom right, and chord BD is from bottom left to top. These two chords would cross each other inside the circle. So yes, in that case, chords AC and BD intersect. So, the key is that the four points are arranged such that when you connect the chords, they cross each other. So, the condition for intersection is that the four points are interleaved, meaning that between the two chords, the points alternate.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that, when selecting four random points on a circle, the two chords AB and CD intersect. Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, the order around the circle is a random permutation of the four points.\n\nWait, but since the circle is rotationally symmetric, we can fix one point and consider the positions of the other three relative to it. However, since all points are chosen independently, maybe we can fix the positions and consider the relative order.\n\nAlternatively, since the circle is continuous, the probability should depend only on the relative positions of the points. So, the key is the arrangement of the four points around the circle. For two chords to intersect, the four points must be arranged in such a way that the chords form a crossing. As we saw earlier, this happens when the points are interleaved, i.e., not all four points lie on a semicircle such that one chord is entirely inside the other.\n\nWait, actually, another way to think about it is that two chords intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order. So, for example, if the order is A, B, C, D, then chords AB and CD do not intersect, but if the order is A, C, B, D, then chords AC and BD intersect. So, the number of such interleaved permutations divided by the total number of permutations gives the probability.\n\nBut since the points are chosen randomly and independently, the order is a random permutation of the four points. Therefore, the probability that the four points are arranged in an interleaved order (which causes the chords to intersect) is equal to the number of such permutations divided by the total number of permutations.\n\nSo, how many interleaved permutations are there? Let's see. For four distinct points on a circle, the number of ways to arrange them such that the chords AB and CD intersect. Let's fix points A and B first. Since the circle is rotationally symmetric, we can fix point A at a certain position. Then, the positions of the other three points B, C, D are randomly placed around the circle. Wait, but actually, since all four points are chosen independently, perhaps the probability is independent of the order. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the circle is continuous, the probability can be calculated by considering the positions of the four points. Let me parameterize the circle as a unit circle in the plane. Let's assign angles θ_A, θ_B, θ_C, θ_D to the four points, each uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π. Since the points are chosen independently, the angles are independent and uniformly distributed.\n\nHowever, calculating the probability that chords AB and CD intersect might be complicated in terms of angles. Another approach is to fix one point and consider the relative positions of the other points. For instance, fix point A at angle 0 without loss of generality due to rotational symmetry. Then, the positions of B, C, D are uniformly random in [0, 2π). Let's order the remaining three points. The key is whether point B and point C are interleaved with point D.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. If we fix A at 0, then the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in some order around the circle. The chord AB is from A (0) to B, and chord CD is from C to D. For these chords to intersect, the arcs AB and CD must cross each other. In terms of angles, if B is somewhere in the circle, and C and D are on either side of B, then the chords might intersect. Wait, but chords don't necessarily correspond directly to arcs. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the points are arranged in the order A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C when moving around the circle. So, for example, if going around the circle, we encounter A, then C, then B, then D, then the chords AC and BD intersect. Similarly, A, D, B, C would also result in intersecting chords.\n\nTherefore, the number of such permutations where the four points are interleaved such that the chords cross is 2. Wait, but how many such permutations are there?\n\nWait, for four distinct points on a circle, there are 4! = 24 possible permutations. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, we can fix one point, say A, and consider the arrangements of the other three points B, C, D. Fixing A at a position, the remaining three points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. However, the circle has reflectional symmetry as well, so we might need to account for that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the circular permutations. The number of distinct circular permutations of n objects is (n-1)!. So, for four points, it's 3! = 6 distinct arrangements. However, in our case, since the chords AB and CD are fixed once the points are placed, maybe the reflection also matters. Wait, but in the problem, the chords are fixed by the points, so reflections would be different arrangements.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of linear permutations. If we fix point A at a position, then the other three points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways around the circle. For each of these arrangements, we can check whether chords AB and CD intersect.\n\nLet me list all possible permutations of B, C, D relative to A. Let's fix A at 0 degrees. Then, the positions of B, C, D can be in any order around the circle. Let's list the possible orders:\n\n1. A, B, C, D\n2. A, B, D, C\n3. A, C, B, D\n4. A, C, D, B\n5. A, D, B, C\n6. A, D, C, B\n\nNow, for each of these permutations, we can check if chords AB and CD intersect.\n\nIn permutation 1: A, B, C, D. Chord AB is from A to B (adjacent), chord CD is from C to D (adjacent). These chords do not intersect.\n\nPermutation 2: A, B, D, C. Chord AB is from A to B (adjacent), chord CD is from C to D. Wait, in this order, the points are A, B, D, C. So, chord CD would connect C to D, but since the order is A, B, D, C around the circle, chord CD would be from C back to D, which skips over A and B. Wait, no. Wait, in this permutation, the order is A, B, D, C. So the points are placed in the circle as A, then B, then D, then C. So chord CD connects C to D. But since C is after D in the order, chord CD would be from D to C (since it's a chord, it doesn't have direction). So chord CD is from D to C, which is adjacent. Chord AB is from A to B, which is adjacent. So again, they don't intersect.\n\nPermutation 3: A, C, B, D. Chord AB connects A to B (third position). Chord CD connects C to D (fourth position). So in this arrangement, chord AB spans from A to B, passing through the area where C and D are. Chord CD spans from C to D, adjacent. Do they intersect? If the order is A, C, B, D, then chord AB is from A to B, which would cross chord CD if CD is from C to D. Let me visualize: A is at 0, C is at some angle, B is after C but before D, and D is after B. So chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from C to D. If A, C, B, D are in order, then chord AB is from A (0) to B (between C and D), and chord CD is from C to D. These two chords might intersect if B is placed between C and D. Wait, but in permutation 3, the order is A, C, B, D. So after A comes C, then B, then D. So chord AB is from A to B, which is between C and D. Chord CD is from C to D. So these chords would intersect. Because chord AB is crossing from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D, which is on the other side. So yes, they intersect.\n\nPermutation 4: A, C, D, B. Chord AB connects A to B (last position). Chord CD connects C to D (second position). So in order A, C, D, B, chord AB is from A to B (which is near the end of the circle), and chord CD is from C to D (adjacent). Do these intersect? If A is at 0, C is next, then D, then B. Chord AB is from A (0) to B (after D), which is almost the full circle. Chord CD is from C to D, which is adjacent. So chord AB would wrap around the circle from A to B, passing through C and D, and chord CD is from C to D. These two chords would intersect at some point inside the circle. So yes, they intersect.\n\nPermutation 5: A, D, B, C. Chord AB connects A to B (third position). Chord CD connects C to D (first position). Order is A, D, B, C. So chord AB is from A to B (third), chord CD is from C to D (first). So chord CD is from C to D (which is near A), and chord AB is from A to B (after D). So these chords would intersect. Let me see: A is at 0, D is next, then B, then C. Chord AB is from A to B (skipping D), and chord CD is from C to D (adjacent). So chord AB would go from A to B, passing over D, and chord CD is from C to D. These two chords would cross each other inside the circle.\n\nPermutation 6: A, D, C, B. Chord AB connects A to B (last position). Chord CD connects C to D (first position). Order is A, D, C, B. Chord AB is from A to B (near the end), chord CD is from C to D (adjacent). Do these intersect? If A is at 0, D is next, then C, then B. Chord AB is from A to B (near the end), chord CD is from C to D (adjacent). These chords would not intersect because chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D, which is on the other side of the circle. So they don't cross.\n\nSo out of the 6 permutations, permutations 3, 4, and 5 result in intersecting chords. That's 3 out of 6, so a probability of 1/2. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but hold on. When we fix point A, the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. However, the circle is rotationally symmetric, so fixing A doesn't affect the generality. But in reality, when choosing four", "answer": "\\frac{1}{3}"}

Kolik takových nádob s vodou bude potřeba k naplnění kulové nádrže s poloměrem 6 cm?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about how many cylindrical glasses, each 8 cm tall and with a radius of 3 cm, are needed to fill a spherical can with a radius of 6 cm. Alright, first, I need to figure out the volume of both the glass and the spherical can. Then, by dividing the volume of the can by the volume of one glass, I should get the number of glasses needed. Let me make sure I remember the formulas correctly.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. For the cylindrical glass, the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging those values in, the volume of one glass would be π*(3)^2*8. Let me calculate that: 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 8 is 72. So, the volume of one glass is 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, the spherical can. The volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)πr³. The radius here is 6 cm. Plugging that into the formula, we get (4/3)π*(6)^3. Let's compute that step by step. 6 cubed is 6*6*6 = 216. Then, multiplying by 4/3: (4/3)*216. Hmm, 216 divided by 3 is 72, and 72 multiplied by 4 is 288. So, the volume of the spherical can is 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, to find out how many glasses are needed, we divide the volume of the can by the volume of one glass. That would be 288π divided by 72π. The π terms cancel out, which makes sense because the units are the same. So, 288 divided by 72 is... let's see, 72 times 4 is 288. So, 288/72 = 4. Therefore, the answer should be 4 glasses.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify the calculations again. For the cylinder: radius 3, height 8. Volume is π*9*8 = 72π. Correct. For the sphere: radius 6, volume is (4/3)π*216. 216 divided by 3 is 72, multiplied by 4 is 288. So, 288π. Dividing 288π by 72π gives 4. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? The problem mentions that the glasses are filled with water, and we need to completely fill the spherical can. Since the units are all in centimeters, the volume is in cubic centimeters, which is equivalent to milliliters (since 1 cm³ = 1 ml). So, 72π ml per glass and 288π ml total. So, 288π divided by 72π is indeed 4. \n\nHmm, but wait, is there a possibility that the spherical can isn't completely filled when you pour the water from the cylindrical glasses? For example, if the glasses are filled to the brim and poured into the can, but the can is a sphere. Maybe the way the water is poured affects the volume, but since we are assuming ideal conditions (no spillage, perfect pouring), the total volume should just be additive. So, the calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spherical can is being filled by pouring water from the cylindrical glasses into it. So, each glass contributes 72π volume into the can, and the total needed is 288π. Therefore, 288π /72π = 4. So, 4 glasses. \n\nI think that's straightforward. Let me check if there's a different interpretation. The problem says \"kolik takových náЎob s vodou bude potřeba k naplnění koulsové nádrže s poloměrem 6 cm\". Translating that: \"How many such glasses with water are needed to fill a spherical container with radius 6 cm?\" So, yes, the answer is 4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. For example, maybe the cylindrical glasses are not full? But the problem states \"s nádobe s vodou\", which means filled with water. So, each glass is full. Therefore, each contributes its full volume. So, no, there's no trick here. It's a straightforward volume division. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4. So, the number of glasses needed is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill a spherical container, we calculate their volumes and divide the sphere's volume by one glass's volume.\n\n1. **Volume of one cylindrical glass**:  \n   Radius \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\), height \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{glass}} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the spherical container**:  \n   Radius \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of glasses required**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{glass}}} = \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = \\frac{288}{72} = 4\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{4}", "answer": "4"}

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that arcsin is the inverse function of sine. So, if I have arcsin x, that's the angle whose sine is x. Therefore, arcsin 0.4 is an angle whose sine is 0.4, and similarly for arcsin 0.5. Let me denote:\n\nLet α = arcsin 0.4, so sin α = 0.4.\n\nLet β = arcsin 0.5, so sin β = 0.5.\n\nThe problem then becomes finding sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). Hmm, okay. So I need to compute the sine of the sum and the sine of the difference of these two angles and then multiply them together.\n\nI remember there are trigonometric identities for sin(A + B) and sin(A - B). Let me recall them:\n\nsin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n\nsin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B\n\nSo if I apply these identities, then multiply the two expressions together, maybe something cancels out or simplifies. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute sin(α + β):\n\nsin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β\n\nSimilarly, sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α\n\nSo multiplying these two:\n\n[sin α cos β + cos α sin β][sin β cos α - cos β sin α]\n\nHmm, let's multiply these two binomials. Let me expand the product:\n\nFirst term: sin α cos β * sin β cos α\n\nSecond term: sin α cos β * (-cos β sin α)\n\nThird term: cos α sin β * sin β cos α\n\nFourth term: cos α sin β * (-cos β sin α)\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: sin α cos β * sin β cos α = sin α sin β cos α cos β\n\nSecond term: sin α cos β * (-cos β sin α) = -sin² α cos² β\n\nThird term: cos α sin β * sin β cos α = cos² α sin² β\n\nFourth term: cos α sin β * (-cos β sin α) = -cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nNow, combining all four terms:\n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term + Fourth term\n\nSo:\n\nsin α sin β cos α cos β - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β - cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nWait, the first term and the fourth term are the same but with opposite signs? Let's check:\n\nFirst term: sin α sin β cos α cos β\n\nFourth term: -cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nYes, they are negatives of each other. So they cancel out.\n\nSo remaining terms are:\n\nSecond term: - sin² α cos² β\n\nThird term: + cos² α sin² β\n\nTherefore, the product simplifies to:\n\n- sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ncos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β\n\nHmm, maybe factor this expression? Let's see:\n\ncos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β = (cos α sin β - sin α cos β)(cos α sin β + sin α cos β)\n\nBut wait, cos α sin β - sin α cos β is equal to sin(β - α) [from the sine subtraction formula], and cos α sin β + sin α cos β is sin(α + β). Wait, but that would mean:\n\n( sin(β - α) )( sin(α + β) ) = sin(β - α) sin(α + β)\n\nBut that's exactly the original expression we had! So that seems like going in circles. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the expression:\n\ncos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β = (cos α sin β)^2 - (sin α cos β)^2\n\nWhich is a difference of squares, so that factors as:\n\n(cos α sin β - sin α cos β)(cos α sin β + sin α cos β)\n\nBut as mentioned, these are sin(β - α) and sin(α + β). So again, we get back to the original product. So that approach might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the product cos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β in terms of other identities.\n\nWait, perhaps use the identity:\n\ncos² x = 1 - sin² x\n\nSo substitute that in:\n\ncos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β = (1 - sin² α) sin² β - sin² α (1 - sin² β)\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n= sin² β - sin² α sin² β - sin² α + sin² α sin² β\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: sin² β\n\nSecond term: - sin² α sin² β\n\nThird term: - sin² α\n\nFourth term: + sin² α sin² β\n\nNotice that the second and fourth terms cancel each other out (- sin² α sin² β + sin² α sin² β = 0)\n\nSo we're left with sin² β - sin² α\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to sin² β - sin² α\n\nOh! That's a big simplification. So the product sin(α + β) sin(β - α) simplifies to sin² β - sin² α.\n\nWow, that's much simpler. So then, since we know sin α = 0.4 and sin β = 0.5, we can compute sin² β - sin² α = (0.5)^2 - (0.4)^2 = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09.\n\nTherefore, the value should be 0.09, which is 9/100. So the answer is 0.09 or 9/100. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify my steps because sometimes when dealing with trigonometric identities, there can be sign errors or misinterpretations.\n\nFirst, we set α = arcsin 0.4 and β = arcsin 0.5. Then we found that sin(α + β) sin(β - α) = sin² β - sin² α. Let's verify that.\n\nWait, we had:\n\nsin(α + β) sin(β - α) = [sin α cos β + cos α sin β][sin β cos α - cos β sin α]\n\nWhich expanded to:\n\nsin α sin β cos α cos β - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β - cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nThen, the first and last terms canceled, leaving - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β\n\nThen we factored that as (cos α sin β - sin α cos β)(cos α sin β + sin α cos β) = sin(β - α) sin(α + β), which is the original expression.\n\nBut then, when we tried to express it as a difference of squares, we ended up with sin² β - sin² α. Wait, how did that happen?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncos² α sin² β - sin² α cos² β = (1 - sin² α) sin² β - sin² α (1 - sin² β)\n\nExpanding:\n\n= sin² β - sin² α sin² β - sin² α + sin² α sin² β\n\nThen, the - sin² α sin² β and + sin² α sin² β cancel, leaving sin² β - sin² α. Yes, that's correct. So that step is valid.\n\nTherefore, sin(α + β) sin(β - α) = sin² β - sin² α = (0.5)^2 - (0.4)^2 = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09. So 0.09 is 9/100. So the answer is 9/100 or 0.09.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to compute this, just to confirm. Maybe compute each sine term separately and then multiply? Let's see.\n\nFirst, compute sin(α + β). To compute this, we need sin α, cos α, sin β, cos β. We know sin α = 0.4 and sin β = 0.5. Then cos α and cos β can be found using Pythagoras:\n\ncos α = sqrt(1 - sin² α) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165\n\nSimilarly, cos β = sqrt(1 - sin² β) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660\n\nSo sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β ≈ 0.4 * 0.8660 + 0.9165 * 0.5 ≈ 0.3464 + 0.45825 ≈ 0.80465\n\nSimilarly, sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α ≈ 0.5 * 0.9165 - 0.8660 * 0.4 ≈ 0.45825 - 0.3464 ≈ 0.11185\n\nThen, multiplying these two approximate values: 0.80465 * 0.11185 ≈ 0.0900, which is approximately 0.09. So that's 9/100. So the exact value is 9/100, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the answer is 9/100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem is sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) * sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4). Let me denote arcsin 0.4 as α and arcsin 0.5 as β. Then the expression is sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). As we saw, this simplifies to sin² β - sin² α. Which is 0.5² - 0.4² = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09.\n\nAlternatively, since sin² β - sin² α = (sin β - sin α)(sin β + sin α). But that might not help here. But in this case, since we can compute sin β and sin α directly, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, could there be an identity that directly relates sin(A + B) sin(A - B) to something else? Wait, actually, there is an identity: sin(A + B) sin(A - B) = sin² A - sin² B. Wait, let me check.\n\nLet me compute sin(A + B) sin(A - B):\n\n= [sin A cos B + cos A sin B][sin A cos B - cos A sin B]\n\n= (sin A cos B)^2 - (cos A sin B)^2\n\n= sin² A cos² B - cos² A sin² B\n\n= sin² A (1 - sin² B) - (1 - sin² A) sin² B\n\n= sin² A - sin² A sin² B - sin² B + sin² A sin² B\n\n= sin² A - sin² B\n\nYes! So sin(A + B) sin(A - B) = sin² A - sin² B. Therefore, in our problem, since A is α and B is β, it's sin² α - sin² β. Wait, but in our previous calculation, we had sin² β - sin² α. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the identity, it's sin(A + B) sin(A - B) = sin² A - sin² B. So if we have sin(α + β) sin(β - α), that would be sin(A + B) sin(A - B) where A = α and B = β. Therefore, it's sin² α - sin² β. But in our problem, it's sin(α + β) sin(β - α) = sin(α + β) sin(-(α - β)) = - sin(α + β) sin(α - β). Therefore, sin(α + β) sin(β - α) = - [sin(α + β) sin(α - β)] = - [sin² α - sin² β] = sin² β - sin² α. Which matches our earlier result. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, using the identity sin(A + B) sin(A - B) = sin² A - sin² B, but since the second term is sin(B - A) instead of sin(A - B), we have to consider the negative sign, leading to sin² B - sin² A.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) * sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = sin² β - sin² α = (0.5)^2 - (0.4)^2 = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100.\n\nJust to make sure, let's compute the numerical values step by step again.\n\nFirst, compute sin(α + β):\n\nα = arcsin 0.4, so α ≈ arcsin(0.4) ≈ 0.4115 radians (since sin(0.4115) ≈ 0.4)\n\nβ = arcsin(0.5) = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nTherefore, α + β ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351 radians\n\nsin(0.9351) ≈ sin(0.9351) ≈ 0.8040\n\nSimilarly, β - α ≈ 0.5236 - 0.4115 ≈ 0.1121 radians\n\nsin(0.1121) ≈ 0.1119\n\nMultiply them together: 0.8040 * 0.1119 ≈ 0.0900, which is approximately 0.09. So that's 9/100. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9/100, which is", "answer": "\\frac{9}{100}"}

Jaká je rychlost kola vyjádřená v palcích za sekundu?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: Kolo festiváře měl rychlost 20 stop za minutu. Jaká je rychlosť kola vyjádřená v palcěch za sekundu? Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I think \"rychlost 20 stop za minutu\" translates to \"speed 20 stops per minute.\" And we need to convert that speed into palcaches per second. Wait, palcaches? Maybe that's a translation issue. Let me check. The original problem is in Czech. \"Kolo festiváře měl rychlost 20 stop za minutu.\" So \"stop\" might be \"stoppes,\" and \"palcích\" could be a mistranslation or different term. Alternatively, maybe \"stoppes\" and \"palcče\" refer to units of distance. \n\nBut maybe \"stoppes\" is a unit of distance. Wait, in Czech, \"stópа\" can mean a foot, but sometimes in certain contexts, especially in traditional units, \"stópа\" might refer to a different length. Alternatively, \"stópа\" could be a mistranslation. Wait, perhaps the original problem is using \"stópа\" as a unit of length, but I need to recall or figure out the conversion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" or something else, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is about angular speed? Like revolutions per minute? Because \"stópа\" might be a mistranslation of \"stáročína\" or something related to time. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Kolo festiváře měl rychlost 20 stop za minutu. Jaká je rychlosť kola vyjádřená v palcěch za sekundu?\" Translating directly: \"The carousel has a speed of 20 stops per minute. What is the speed of the carousel expressed in palcaches per second?\" \n\nSo maybe \"stop\" here is a unit of distance, and \"palcach\" is another unit. If \"stop\" is distance, and \"palcach\" is another distance unit, then we need to convert the speed from stops per minute to palcaches per second. But without knowing the exact conversion between stops and palcaches, how can we proceed? \n\nWait, maybe \"stópа\" is a mistranslation. Let me check the Czech original. Wait, the user provided the original problem in Czech, but in the translation, they used \"stópа\" which is \"stop\" in Czech. Wait, maybe the original problem was in another language, and \"stópа\" is a mistranslation. For example, in some languages, \"stop\" can mean \"step\" or \"distance unit.\" Alternatively, in the context of a carousel, maybe \"stópа\" is a unit of length specific to the carousel's scale. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was in another language, like German, where \"stopping\" could be \"stöpchen,\" but that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a problem involving angular speed, where \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but that's not standard. Wait, perhaps \"stópа\" here is a unit of angular displacement, like revolutions per minute. If that's the case, then we need to convert revolutions per minute to revolutions per second, and maybe relate that to linear speed in some unit, but the problem mentions \"palcaches,\" which is a unit of length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is mixing units. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the carousel has a speed of 20 stops per minute. We need to find the speed expressed in palcaches per second. So, probably, we need to convert the rotational speed (if \"stop\" is revolutions) to linear speed in palcaches per second. But then we need the radius of the carousel or the length of a \"stop,\" which isn't provided. Wait, maybe \"stop\" is a unit of length. For example, in some contexts, \"stop\" can be a unit of length, similar to a step or a stride. If each \"stop\" is a certain length, then 20 stops per minute would be 20 times that length per minute. Then, converting that to palcaches per second. But again, without knowing the conversion between stops and palcaches, how can we proceed? \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is a mistranslation of \"stöpchen,\" which is a Czech word for a step. But in that case, \"stöpchen\" would be a unit of length, perhaps the length of a step. If the carousel's radius is known in steps, but the problem doesn't provide that. \n\nWait, perhaps this is a trick question where \"stópа\" and \"palcach\" are the same unit, so 20 stops per minute is equivalent to 20 palcaches per minute, and then converted to palcaches per second. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is a different unit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the original problem was in another language, and \"stópа\" is a mistranslation. For example, in Czech, \"stáročína\" means \"time,\" but that's not relevant here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps \"stópа\" is a unit of time. If the carousel moves at 20 stops per minute, and we need to express that in palcaches per second, but without knowing the spatial component, how? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about linear speed but angular speed. For example, 20 revolutions per minute, and we need to convert that to revolutions per second, which would be 20/60 = 1/3 revolutions per second. But again, unless we relate angular speed to linear speed, which requires radius. \n\nBut the problem mentions \"palcaches,\" which is a linear unit. So perhaps the question is asking for the linear speed of a point on the carousel in palcaches per second. To find linear speed, we need the formula: linear speed (v) = angular speed (ω) * radius (r). But we don't have the radius. However, if \"20 stops per minute\" refers to revolutions per minute, then angular speed ω = 20 RPM. Then, converting to RPS (revolutions per second): 20/60 = 1/3 RPS. Then, if we can find the radius in palcaches, we can compute v = ω * r. But the problem doesn't mention the radius. \n\nWait, maybe \"stop\" is a unit of length. For example, if one \"stop\" is the length from the center to the outer edge (the radius), then 20 stops per minute would mean 20 radii per minute. But then converting that to palcaches per second would require knowing how many palcaches are in one radius. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"stop\" as a unit of distance, and \"palcach\" as another unit. For example, 1 stop = X palcaches. Then, 20 stops per minute = 20X palcaches per minute. Then, converting to per second: 20X/60 = (X/3) palcaches per second. But the problem doesn't specify the conversion between stops and palcaches. \n\nWait, maybe the original problem in Czech had specific units, but in translation, they became \"stop\" and \"palcach.\" Alternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is a mistranslation of \"stöpchen,\" which is a Czech word for a step. For example, \"stöpchen\" can measure the length of a step. If the carousel is 20 stöpchen wide, but the problem states speed in stops per minute. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is a direct translation from another language, and \"stópа\" and \"palcach\" are mistranslations. For example, in Spanish, \"piedad\" might be \"step,\" and \"milla\" is a thousand. But without knowing the exact source, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking to convert 20 units per minute to units per second, assuming that \"stop\" and \"palcach\" are the same unit. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" and \"palcach\" is a mistranslation of \"stopping,\" but that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the translation. Let me check the original problem again: \"Kolo festiváře měl rychlost 20 stop za minutu. Jaká je rychlosť kola vyjádřená v palcěch za sekundu?\" So \"20 stops per minute,\" \"what is the speed expressed in palcaches per second?\" \n\nIf \"stop\" is a unit of distance, then 20 stops per minute is 20 stops/min. To convert to palcaches per second, we need to know how many palcaches are in a stop. For example, if 1 stop = 1 palache, then 20 palcaches per minute, which is 20/60 = 1/3 palcaches per second. But if 1 stop = X palcaches, then the answer is (20 * X)/60 = (X)/3. But since X is unknown, we can't compute a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is a unit of time, like a second? But 20 stops per minute would then be 20 stops/60 seconds = 1/3 stops per second. But that still doesn't relate to palcaches. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is mixing angular and linear units. For example, 20 revolutions per minute, convert to revolutions per second, then relate to linear speed if the radius is given. But since the radius isn't given, perhaps the answer is expected to be in terms of revolutions per second, which is 1/3. But the problem mentions \"palcaches,\" which is a linear unit, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" refers to a step, and each step is a certain length, say 1 palache. Then, 20 steps per minute would be 20 palcaches per minute, which converts to 1/3 palcaches per second. But again, this is assuming 1 step = 1 palache. \n\nGiven that the problem is presented without specific conversion factors, perhaps it's a trick question where the answer is simply 20 divided by 60, which is 1/3. But since it mentions palcaches, maybe the answer is 1/3 palcaches per second. However, without knowing the relationship between stops and palcaches, this is speculative. \n\nWait, perhaps the original problem in Czech uses \"stópа\" and \"palcach\" as the same unit, so converting between them is trivial. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a misprint, and \"stópа\" should be \"stöpchen\" and \"palcach\" should be \"stöpchen.\" Then, the answer is 20 stöpchen per minute, which is 1/3 stöpchen per second. But that still doesn't relate to palcaches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another language where \"stópа\" and \"palcach\" are related. For example, in some languages, \"stópа\" (step) and \"palcach\" (step) might be the same word, but mistranslated. \n\nGiven that I can't resolve the units, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple conversion from per minute to per second, ignoring the units. So 20 per minute divided by 60 gives 1/3 per second. If the question expects the answer in palcaches per second, then maybe the answer is 1/3, assuming that \"stop\" and \"palcach\" are equivalent. But this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about angular speed and linear speed. If the carousel has a speed of 20 revolutions per minute, then the linear speed v = ω * r, where ω is 20 RPM, converted to RPS (1/3 RPS), and r is the radius. If the radius is given in palcaches, then v would be (1/3) * r palcaches per second. But since the radius isn't given, we can't compute a numerical answer. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"kola vyjádřená v palcěch za sekundu\" which is \"the speed of the carousel expressed in palcaches per second.\" So maybe the question is expecting to convert the angular speed to linear speed, assuming a certain radius. But since the radius isn't provided, perhaps there's missing information. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópа\" is a unit of length, and \"palcach\" is another unit. For example, if 1 stópа = 10 palcaches, then 20 stópа = 200 palcaches per minute, which is 200/60 ≈ 3.333 palcaches per second. But again, without knowing the exact conversion, this is guesswork. \n\nGiven that the problem is presented without specific conversion factors, it's possible that the user intended to use a different unit but there was a translation error. For example, if \"stópа\" is \"stopping\" but in the original problem, it's a unit of length, and \"palcach\" is also a unit of length, then converting stops to palcaches would require a conversion factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the answer is simply 20 divided by 60, which is 1/3, and since the units are per minute and per second, the answer is 1/3 palcaches per second. But this is assuming that \"stop\" and \"palcach\" are equivalent, which they might not be. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is", "answer": "4"}
{"original_question": "Senátní výbor má 8 republikánů a 6 demokratů. Kolika způsoby můžeme vytvořit podvýbor o 5 členech, který má alespoň jednoho člena z každé strany?", "question": "Senátní výbor má 8 republikánů a 6 demokratů. Kolika způsoby můžeme vytvořit podvýbor o 5 členech, který má alespoň jednoho člena z každé strany?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many ways we can form a subcommittee of 5 members from a selection of 8 republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, without any restrictions, the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 people (8 + 6) is the combination of 14 choose 5. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(14, 5) = 14! / (5! * 9!) = (14*13*12*11*10) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 24024 / 120 = 2002. So, 2002 total possible subcommittees.\n\nBut the problem states that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party. That means we have to subtract the cases where all members are from one party. There are two scenarios to exclude: all 5 members are republicans, or all 5 members are Democrats.\n\nLet's compute those two cases.\n\nFirst, all 5 members are republicans. There are 8 republicans, so the number of ways is C(8, 5). Let me compute that:\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * 3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 336 / 6 = 56.\n\nNext, all 5 members are Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, so the number of ways is C(6, 5):\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * 1!) = 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of invalid subcommittees (all from one party) is 56 + 6 = 62.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid subcommittees with at least one member from each party is the total minus the invalid ones: 2002 - 62 = 1940.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the logic is that total combinations minus the ones that don't meet the requirement. Since the requirement is at least one from each party, the invalid cases are indeed all from one party. So subtracting those gives the desired count. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is by considering the different valid distributions of the 5 members between the two parties. Since we need at least one from each party, the possible distributions are:\n\n1. 1 Republican and 4 Democrats\n2. 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats\n3. 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats\n4. 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat\n\nThese are all the valid combinations where both parties are represented. Then, we can calculate each case separately and sum them up.\n\nLet's try this method to verify.\n\nCase 1: 1 rep and 4 dems.\n\nNumber of ways = C(8,1) * C(6,4)\n\nC(8,1) is 8.\n\nC(6,4) = C(6,2) = (6*5)/2 = 15.\n\nSo, 8 * 15 = 120.\n\nCase 2: 2 rep and 3 dems.\n\nC(8,2) * C(6,3)\n\nC(8,2) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nC(6,3) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20.\n\nSo, 28 * 20 = 560.\n\nCase 3: 3 rep and 2 dems.\n\nC(8,3) * C(6,2)\n\nC(8,3) = (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = 56.\n\nC(6,2) = 15.\n\n56 * 15 = 840.\n\nCase 4: 4 rep and 1 dem.\n\nC(8,4) * C(6,1)\n\nC(8,4) = (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1) = 70.\n\nC(6,1) = 6.\n\n70 * 6 = 420.\n\nNow, summing up all these cases:\n\n120 + 560 + 840 + 420 = Let's compute step by step.\n\n120 + 560 = 680\n\n680 + 840 = 1520\n\n1520 + 420 = 1940\n\nSo, same result as before: 1940.

{"original_question": "Jaká je hodnota $513^2 - 487^2$?", "question": "Jaká je hodnota $513^2 - 487^2$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of 513 squared minus 487 squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember there's a formula for the difference of squares, right? It goes like a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe that can help here instead of calculating each square separately, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLet me write that down. If I let a = 513 and b = 487, then the expression becomes (513 - 487)(513 + 487). Let me compute those two parts. \n\nFirst, 513 minus 487. Let's subtract 487 from 513. 513 minus 400 is 113, then minus 87 more. 113 minus 87 is... 26? Wait, 113 - 80 is 33, then minus 7 is 26. Yeah, so that's 26.\n\nThen, 513 plus 487. Let's add those. 500 + 400 is 900, 13 + 87 is 100. So 900 + 100 is 1000. Oh, that's nice. So (513 - 487) is 26 and (513 + 487) is 1000. So multiplying those together: 26 * 1000. That's straightforward. 26 times 1000 is 26,000. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my subtraction. 513 - 487. 513 minus 480 is 33, then minus 7 more is 26. Yep, that's correct. And the addition: 513 + 487. 500 + 400 is 900, 13 + 87 is 100. 900 + 100 is 1000. That seems right. So 26 * 1000 is definitely 26,000. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute 513 squared and 487 squared separately, just to verify, let's see:\n\n513 squared. Let's calculate that. 500 squared is 250,000. Then, 13 squared is 169. The cross term is 2*500*13 = 13,000. So 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 263,169.\n\nSimilarly, 487 squared. 500 - 13 = 487. So (500 - 13) squared is 500² - 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 - 13,000 + 169 = 250,000 - 13,000 is 237,000, plus 169 is 237,169.\n\nSo 263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract. 263,169 - 237,169. The first part is 237,169 + 26,000 = 263,169. So yes, the difference is 26,000. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of 513² - 487² is 26,000. I think that's solid. The difference of squares formula simplifies it a lot instead of calculating each square individually. So the answer is 26,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\boxed{26000}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\), we can use the difference of squares formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).

Hmm, trigonometric products can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or identity that can help here. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me note the angles: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, right? Because π is 15π/15, so 16π/15 is π + π/15. Since cosine has a period of 2π, cos(16π/15) is the same as cos(π + π/15). And cosine of π + θ is equal to -cosθ. So cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). That might be useful. Similarly, maybe the other angles can be simplified or related to other angles?\n\nLet me list all angles:\n\n1. 2π/15\n2. 4π/15\n3. 8π/15\n4. 16π/15 (which is π + π/15, so -cos(π/15))\n\nSo the product becomes: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * (-cos(π/15)). So that's -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Hmm, now I need to compute the product of cos(π/15), cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and then multiply by -1.\n\nI remember that products of cosines with angles doubling each time can sometimes be simplified using certain identities. For example, there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines where each angle is double the previous one. Let me recall that.\n\nI think the formula is cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^nθ) / (2^n sinθ). Let me check if that's correct. For example, if n=2, then cosθ * cos2θ = sin(4θ)/(2^2 sinθ) = sin4θ/(4 sinθ). Let me verify with θ=π/4. Then left side: cos(π/4)*cos(π/2) = (√2/2)*0 = 0. Right side: sin(π)/ (4 sin(π/4)) = 0/(4*(√2/2))=0. Okay, that works. Another test: θ=π/3. Left side: cos(π/3)*cos(2π/3) = (1/2)*(-1/2) = -1/4. Right side: sin(4π/3)/(4 sin(π/3)) = (-√3/2)/(4*(√3/2)) = (-√3/2)/(2√3) = -1/4. Okay, that works too. So the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, applying this formula for the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15), which is the product of four terms where each angle is double the previous one, starting from θ=π/15. Then according to the formula, the product should be sin(16*(π/15)) / (2^4 sin(π/15)).\n\nWait, 2^4 is 16, so the product is sin(16π/15) / (16 sin(π/15)). Let's compute sin(16π/15). 16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, the product becomes (-sin(π/15)) / (16 sin(π/15)) = -1/16. So the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original product, which was -1 times that, is -1 * (-1/16) = 1/16.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Original product was:\n\ncos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15) = cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * (-cos(π/15)) = -cos(π/15)*cos(2π/15)*cos(4π/15)*cos(8π/15) = -(-1/16) = 1/16. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify the formula again. The formula is for the product of cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^nθ)/(2^n sinθ). In this case, n=4, so 2^4θ = 16θ. So θ=π/15. Then 2^4θ = 16*(π/15) = 16π/15. So sin(16π/15) / (16 sin(π/15)). Since sin(16π/15)=sin(π + π/15)= -sin(π/15). Therefore, sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15))= -sin(π/15)/(16 sin(π/15))= -1/16. So the product is indeed -1/16, so multiplying by -1 gives 1/16. So the answer is 1/16. Therefore, the original product simplifies to 1/16.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check with another approach. Maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity. The angles here are all multiples of 2π/15, but not all 15th roots of unity. Wait, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Let me note that 16π/15 is equivalent to -π/15 (since 16π/15 - π = π/15). So, the angles are π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, and -π/15. But cosine is even, so cos(-π/15)=cos(π/15). So the product is [cos(π/15)*cos(2π/15)*cos(4π/15)]^2. Wait, but that's not exactly the case here. Wait, no, in the original product, we have four terms: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. But 8π/15 is 8π/15, and 16π/15 is π + π/15. So maybe we can pair terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the identity that relates products of cosines to sums. But that might get complicated. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for n = 15, the product of cos(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 can be related to certain formulas, but I might need to check. But in this case, we are not taking all angles, just specific ones. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation z^15 = 1, whose roots are e^(2πik/15) for k=0 to 14. The roots can be written as cos(2πk/15) + i sin(2πk/15). The product of (z - e^(2πik/15)) from k=0 to 14 is z^15 - 1. But maybe factoring out (z - 1), we get the 14th cyclotomic polynomial? Not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using multiple-angle identities. Let me think. Let me consider writing each cosine term in terms of sine functions. Since cosθ = sin(π/2 - θ). Let me see:\n\ncos(π/15) = sin(π/2 - π/15) = sin(13π/30)\ncos(2π/15) = sin(π/2 - 2π/15) = sin(11π/30)\ncos(4π/15) = sin(π/2 - 4π/15) = sin(7π/30)\ncos(8π/15) = sin(π/2 - 8π/15) = sin(-π/30) = -sin(π/30)\n\nHmm, so the product becomes sin(13π/30) * sin(11π/30) * sin(7π/30) * (-sin(π/30)). Not sure if this helps, but maybe there's a product formula for sines with these angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the identity for the product of sines. There's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. But I don't recall the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe express each sine term in terms of complex exponentials.\n\nWait, but this might get too complicated. Let's go back to the previous method. The formula gave us -1/16, and the reasoning seems correct. But let me check with approximate values.\n\nLet me compute each cosine term numerically:\n\nFirst, 2π/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians. cos(0.4189) ≈ 0.9135.\n\n4π/15 ≈ 0.8378 radians. cos(0.8378) ≈ 0.6691.\n\n8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians. cos(1.6755) ≈ 0.0667.\n\n16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians. cos(3.3510) = cos(π + π/15) ≈ -cos(π/15) ≈ -0.9781.\n\nSo the product is approximately 0.9135 * 0.6691 * 0.0667 * (-0.9781). Let's compute step by step:\n\n0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.613\n\n0.613 * 0.0667 ≈ 0.0409\n\n0.0409 * (-0.9781) ≈ -0.0409 * 0.9781 ≈ -0.0400\n\nSo approximately -0.04, which is -1/25 ≈ -0.04. But according to our previous result, the product is 1/16 ≈ 0.0625. Wait, but here we have approximately -0.04. That's a discrepancy. So something must be wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the original problem is to compute cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). But when I converted cos(16π/15) to -cos(π/15), that's correct. So the product is -cos(π/15)*cos(2π/15)*cos(4π/15)*cos(8π/15). Then according to the formula, that product is -(-1/16) = 1/16. But when I compute numerically, I get approximately -0.04. So there's a conflict here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the numerical example. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, let's compute each cosine:\n\n2π/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians. cos(0.4189) ≈ cos(23.96 degrees) ≈ 0.9135. Correct.\n\n4π/15 ≈ 0.8378 radians. cos(0.8378) ≈ cos(48.13 degrees) ≈ 0.6691. Correct.\n\n8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians. cos(1.6755) ≈ cos(95.96 degrees) ≈ -0.0667. Wait, earlier I said 0.0667, but actually cos(95.96 degrees) is negative. So cos(8π/15) ≈ -0.0667.\n\n16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians. cos(3.3510) ≈ cos(191.96 degrees) ≈ -0.9781. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 0.9135 * 0.6691 * (-0.0667) * (-0.9781). Let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.613.\n\nThen, 0.613 * (-0.0667) ≈ -0.0408.\n\nThen, -0.0408 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0400. So approximately 0.04, which is 1/25. Hmm, but according to the formula, it should be 1/16 ≈ 0.0625. So there's a conflict here. Which means my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong", "answer": "\\frac{1}{16}"}

So we have an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC, and the altitude AM = 11. There's a point D on AM such that AD = 10, and angle BDC is three times angle BAC. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Since it's isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude AM will split it into two congruent right triangles, AMB and AMC. The point M is the midpoint of BC, so BM = MC. The length of AM is given as 11, which is the height of the triangle.\n\nNow, point D is on AM such that AD = 10. That means D is 10 units away from A along the altitude, so the remaining distance from D to M is AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 unit. So DM = 1.\n\nWe also know that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let's denote angle BAC as θ. Therefore, angle BDC = 3θ. Our goal is to relate these angles to the sides of the triangle.\n\nSince ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal. Let's call them both β. So in triangle ABC, we have θ + 2β = 180°, which implies β = (180° - θ)/2.\n\nNow, let's consider triangle BDC. We need to find angle BDC, which is given as 3θ. Maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle BDC. But first, let's try to find the lengths of BD, DC, and BC.\n\nBut wait, BC is the base of the isosceles triangle ABC. Let's denote AB = AC = x, and BC = 2y. Then, since AM is the altitude, AM splits BC into two equal parts, each of length y. So BM = MC = y.\n\nIn the right triangle ABM, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: AB² = AM² + BM². So x² = 11² + y². Therefore, x = sqrt(121 + y²). So if we can find y, we can find x, and then the sides AB, AC, BC, and compute the perimeter.\n\nBut how do we relate this to point D and angle BDC?\n\nPoint D is on AM, 10 units from A and 1 unit from M. So coordinates might help here. Let me try to set up coordinate axes.\n\nLet's place point A at (0, 11), and since AM is the altitude, point M is directly below A at (0, 0). Then, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, points B and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let's denote point B as (-a, 0) and point C as (a, 0). Therefore, BM = MC = a, so BC = 2a. Then, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (0, 11)\n\nB: (-a, 0)\n\nC: (a, 0)\n\nM: (0, 0)\n\nPoint D is on AM, 10 units from A. Since AM is from (0, 11) to (0, 0), moving down 10 units from A would place D at (0, 1). So D is at (0, 1).\n\nNow, we need to compute angle BDC. Let's find the coordinates of points B, D, and C:\n\nB: (-a, 0)\n\nD: (0, 1)\n\nC: (a, 0)\n\nSo angle BDC is the angle at point D between points B and C. To find angle BDC, we can use vectors or coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the slopes of DB and DC and find the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the vectors DB and DC.\n\nVector DB is from D to B: (-a, 0) - (0, 1) = (-a, -1)\n\nVector DC is from D to C: (a, 0) - (0, 1) = (a, -1)\n\nThe angle between vectors DB and DC can be found using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (DB · DC) / (|DB| |DC|)\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\nDB · DC = (-a)(a) + (-1)(-1) = -a² + 1\n\nCompute |DB|:\n\n|DB| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(a² + 1)\n\nSimilarly, |DC| = sqrt(a² + 1)\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (-a² + 1) / (sqrt(a² + 1) * sqrt(a² + 1)) = (-a² + 1)/(a² + 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (1 - a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nBut angle BDC is given to be 3θ, where θ is angle BAC. Let's find θ in terms of a.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = x, BC = 2a. The altitude AM = 11, so in the right triangle ABM, we have:\n\ncos(theta/2) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BM / AB = a / x\n\nBut x = sqrt(121 + a²), so:\n\ncos(theta/2) = a / sqrt(121 + a²)\n\nAlternatively, we can use trigonometric identities to relate theta and angle BDC.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to first express theta in terms of a. In triangle ABC, angle at A is theta, and the sides AB = AC = x, BC = 2a.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:\n\nBC² = AB² + AC² - 2 AB * AC * cos(theta)\n\nBut AB = AC = x, so:\n\n(2a)^2 = 2x² - 2x² cos(theta)\n\n4a² = 2x²(1 - cos(theta))\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2a² = x²(1 - cos(theta))\n\nBut x² = 121 + a², so:\n\n2a² = (121 + a²)(1 - cos(theta))\n\nWe can solve for cos(theta):\n\n1 - cos(theta) = 2a² / (121 + a²)\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos(theta) = 1 - (2a²)/(121 + a²) = (121 + a² - 2a²)/(121 + a²) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²)\n\nSo cos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²)\n\nAlternatively, since theta is angle BAC, and in the right triangle ABM, angle at A is theta/2. So cos(theta/2) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BM / AB = a / x = a / sqrt(121 + a²). Therefore,\n\ncos(theta/2) = a / sqrt(121 + a²)\n\nWe can relate this to cos(theta) using the double-angle formula:\n\ncos(theta) = 2cos²(theta/2) - 1\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = 2*(a² / (121 + a²)) - 1 = (2a² / (121 + a²)) - 1 = (2a² - 121 - a²)/(121 + a²) = (a² - 121)/(121 + a²)\n\nBut earlier, we had cos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²). Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, let's check the double-angle formula again.\n\nDouble-angle formula: cos(2α) = 2cos²α - 1. So if theta = 2*(theta/2), then cos(theta) = 2cos²(theta/2) - 1.\n\nBut in our case, cos(theta/2) = a / sqrt(121 + a²). Therefore,\n\ncos(theta) = 2*(a² / (121 + a²)) - 1 = (2a² - (121 + a²)) / (121 + a²) = (2a² - 121 - a²) / (121 + a²) = (a² - 121)/(121 + a²)\n\nBut previously, from the Law of Cosines, we had cos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²). So there's a sign difference here. Wait, that can't be. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the Law of Cosines, we had:\n\ncos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²)\n\nBut according to the double-angle formula:\n\ncos(theta) = 2cos²(theta/2) - 1 = 2*(a² / (121 + a²)) - 1 = (2a² - (121 + a²)) / (121 + a²) = (a² - 121)/(121 + a²)\n\nSo both methods give the same result. The sign is negative if a² < 121, which makes sense because if a² < 121, then angle theta is acute, and cos(theta) is positive if theta is acute. Wait, wait, let's compute.\n\nWait, if a² < 121, then (a² - 121) is negative, so cos(theta) is negative? But theta is an angle in a triangle, so it must be between 0 and 180 degrees. If cos(theta) is negative, theta is obtuse. But if ABC is isosceles with AB=AC, then angle BAC is the vertex angle. If it's obtuse, then the base angles B and C would be acute. If it's acute, then all angles are acute.\n\nBut in our case, the altitude is 11, which is quite long. Let's see. If a² is the square of half the base, then if a is small, the triangle is \"tall\" and skinny, with a large angle at A. If a is large, the triangle is shorter and wider, with a smaller angle at A.\n\nBut according to the expression cos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²). So if a² < 121, cos(theta) is positive, so theta is acute. If a² > 121, cos(theta) is negative, theta is obtuse. If a² = 121, cos(theta) = 0, so theta = 90 degrees.\n\nBut since ABC is isosceles with AB=AC, if theta is 90 degrees, then it's a right-angled isosceles triangle, and BC would be sqrt(2)*AB. But given that the altitude is 11, which in a right-angled isosceles triangle would be half the hypotenuse. Wait, no. Let's check.\n\nWait, if ABC is right-angled at A, then AB = AC = x, and BC = x*sqrt(2). The altitude from A to BC would be x/√2. But in our case, the altitude is 11, so x/√2 = 11 => x = 11√2. Then BC = 11√2 * sqrt(2) = 22. Then perimeter would be 11√2 + 11√2 + 22 = 22√2 + 22 ≈ 22*1.414 + 22 ≈ 31.1 + 22 ≈ 53.1. But we don't know if theta is right angle here, but this is just for reference.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to relate angle BDC = 3 theta. So we have expressions for cos(angle BDC) in terms of a, and expressions for cos(theta) in terms of a. Maybe we can relate them.\n\nEarlier, we found that cos(angle BDC) = (1 - a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nAnd from the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, we have:\n\ncos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²)\n\nBut angle BDC is 3 theta, so we can write:\n\ncos(3 theta) = (1 - a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nBut we also have an expression for cos(theta) in terms of a, which is (121 - a²)/(121 + a²). So we can use the triple-angle formula for cosine.\n\nThe triple-angle formula is:\n\ncos(3 theta) = 4 cos³ theta - 3 cos theta\n\nSo substituting the known expressions:\n\n4 cos³ theta - 3 cos theta = (1 - a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nBut cos(theta) = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²). Let's denote this as C for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\n4C³ - 3C = (1 - a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nBut we can express (1 - a²)/(1 + a²) in terms of C.\n\nLet me first compute (1 - a²)/(1 + a²). Let's note that:\n\nC = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²)\n\nLet me solve for a² in terms of C.\n\nMultiply both sides by (121 + a²):\n\nC(121 + a²) = 121 - a²\n\n121 C + C a² = 121 - a²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nC a² + a² + 121 C - 121 = 0\n\na² (C + 1) + 121 (C - 1) = 0\n\na² = -121 (C - 1)/(C + 1)\n\nBut since a² must be positive, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. Let's check:\n\nIf C = (121 - a²)/(121 + a²), then C is less than 1 because numerator is less than denominator. So C - 1 is negative, and C + 1 is positive (since C is positive). Therefore, -121*(C -1)/(C +1) is positive. So a² is positive, which is good.\n\nBut maybe we can find a relationship between (1 - a²)/(1 + a²) and C.\n\nLet me compute (1 - a²)/(1 + a²):\n\nFirst, let's write 1 - a² = (121 + a²) - (121 + a²) + (1 - a²) = (1", "answer": "11 \\sqrt{5} + 11"}
{"original_question": "Součet 27 po sobě jdoucích kladných celých čísel je $3^7$. Jaký je jejich medián?", "question": "Součet 27 po sobě jdoucích kladných celých čísel je $3^7$. Jaký je jejich medián?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is equal to 3^7. What is their median?\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some math concepts. First, the sum of consecutive numbers. If we have consecutive integers, the average of those numbers would be the same as the median because they are evenly spaced. Since there are 27 numbers, which is an odd count, the median would be the middle number. So, if I can find the average of these numbers, that should give me the median. \n\nWait, right. The average is the sum divided by the number of terms. The sum is given as 3^7, and the number of terms is 27. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 3^7 is 3 multiplied by itself 7 times. Let's compute that:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\nSo, the sum is 2187. Then, the average (which is the same as the median here) would be 2187 divided by 27. Let me do that division.\n\n2187 ÷ 27. Hmm, 27 times 80 is 2160. Then, 2187 minus 2160 is 27. So, 27 ÷ 27 is 1. So, 80 + 1 = 81. Therefore, 2187 ÷ 27 = 81. So, the median is 81. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the median is 81, then the numbers are 27 consecutive integers centered around 81. Since there are 27 numbers, the middle one is the 14th term. Let's verify that.\n\nIf the sequence starts at some number 'a', then the 14th term is the median. The sequence would be a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+26. The median is a + 13. So, according to this, the median is 81. Therefore, a + 13 = 81, so a = 81 - 13 = 68. Then, the sum of these numbers should be 27 times the average, which is 27 * 81. Let's compute that.\n\n27 * 80 = 2160, and 27 * 1 = 27, so 2160 + 27 = 2187. Which matches 3^7. So, that checks out. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about the sum of consecutive numbers is using the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. Since the numbers are consecutive, the last term is first term + 26. So, sum = 27 * (a + (a + 26)) / 2 = 27 * (2a + 26) / 2 = 27 * (a + 13). \n\nGiven that the sum is 2187, then 27 * (a + 13) = 2187. Dividing both sides by 27: a + 13 = 81. Therefore, a = 68, which again gives the median as 81. \n\nSo, both methods confirm that the median is 81. Therefore, the answer should be 81. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just make sure there are no alternative interpretations. The problem states \"27 po sobějdoucích kladných celých čísla\" which translates to \"27 consecutive positive integers\". So, they have to be positive, which is satisfied since a = 68 is positive. So, all numbers are positive. The median is 81, which is the 14th term. Everything seems in order. \n\nNo mistakes in the calculations, and the logic holds. Therefore, the median is 81.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is \\(3^7 = 2187\\). To find their median, we note that the median of an odd-numbered set of consecutive integers is the average of the set. \n\nThe average (and thus the median) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\frac{2187}{27} = 81\n\\]\n\nTo verify, the sequence of numbers is centered around 81. The first term \\(a\\) satisfies:\n\\[\n27 \\times (a + 13) = 2187 \\implies a + 13 = 81 \\implies a = 68\n\\]\nThe numbers are from 68 to 94 (inclusive), confirming the median is the 14th term, which is 81.\n\nThe median is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).", "answer": "81"}

Therefore, \\( x^4 + 4x^2 \\geq 0 \\). This means that \\( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \\) is always true for all real \\( x \\), because the left-hand side is always at least 0, which is greater than -4. So, the left inequality doesn't impose any additional restrictions on \\( x \\).\n\nNext, let's consider the right part of the inequality: \\( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \\).\n\nWe need to solve \\( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \\). Let's rewrite this inequality by bringing all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0 \\]\n\nTo solve this quartic inequality, we can make a substitution to simplify it. Let \\( y = x^2 \\). Since \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative, \\( y \\geq 0 \\). Substituting \\( y \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic inequality \\( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \\). Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation \\( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = -21 \\).

Since \\( y = x^2 \\geq 0 \\), we can disregard the negative root \\( y = -7 \\). The quadratic \\( y^2 + 4y - 21 \\) is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\) is positive), so it will be below zero between its roots. However, since one root is negative and the other is positive, the inequality \\( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \\) holds for \\( y \\) between -7 and 3.

Maybe we made a mistake in the algebra.

Then substituting \\( S = 24/P \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(24/P)( (24/P)^2 - 3P ) = -8\n\\]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n\\[\n(24/P)(576/P^2 - 3P) = -8\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(24 * 576)/P^3 - (24 * 3P)/P = -8\n\\]\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, \\( (24/P) * (576/P^2 - 3P) = 24*576/P^3 - 24*3P^2/P \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n13824/P^3 - 72P^2/P = 13824/P^3 - 72P = -8\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n13824/P^3 - 72P = -8\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( P^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n13824 - 72P^4 = -8P^3\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n72P^4 - 8P^3 - 13824 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide by 8:\n\n\\[\n9P^4 - P^3 - 1728 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\[\n9P^4 - P^3 - 1728 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which is more complicated. Perhaps we made a mistake earlier. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider possible values for \\( S \\) and \\( P \\).

Maybe there is a substitution or factor.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the original equations might have symmetric solutions. Suppose two variables are equal. Let's assume \\( x = y \\).\n\nLet \\( x = y \\). Then, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( x^2 z = 4 \\)\n2. \\( 2x^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( x^3 z + x^2 z + x z^2 + x^2 z + z^3 + x z^2 = 12 \\)\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, try specific values.\n\nSuppose \\( x = y = z \\). Then:\n\n1. \\( x^3 = 4 \\implies x = \\sqrt[3]{4} \\)\n2. \\( 3x^3 = 4 \\implies x^3 = 4/3 \\neq 4 \\). Contradiction.\n\nSo variables are not all equal. Maybe two variables are equal.\n\nAssume \\( x = y \\). Then:\n\nFrom \\( xyz = 4 \\), \\( x^2 z = 4 \\implies z = 4/x^2 \\)\n\nFrom \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\implies 2x^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). Substitute \\( z = 4/x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n2", "answer": "6"}

Let me make sure I understand the question correctly. \n\nEach year, they surveyed 300 men and 300 women. For each year, I have the percentage of men and women who take the bus. The question is asking for the year where the number of men taking the bus is approximately 135% of the number of women taking the bus. Since percentages are given, I can calculate the actual number of men and women taking the bus each year by applying the percentages to the 300 surveyed in each category. Then, I can compare the ratio of men to women for each year and see which one is closest to 135%.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of men and women taking the bus for each year. \n\nStarting with the 9th ročník (9th grade):\n\n- Men: 41.1% of 300. To calculate this, 41.1% is 0.411, so 0.411 * 300. Let me compute that: 300 * 0.411 = 123.3 men.\n  \n- Women: 39.4% of 300. 39.4% is 0.394. 0.394 * 300 = 118.2 women.\n\nThen, the ratio of men to women is 123.3 / 118.2. Let me compute that: 123.3 ÷ 118.2 ≈ 1.043. Hmm, 104.3%. That's the ratio for the 9th grade.\n\nNext, the 10th ročník (10th grade):\n\n- Men: 34.4% of 300. 0.344 * 300 = 103.2 men.\n\n- Women: 33.1% of 300. 0.331 * 300 = 99.3 women.\n\nRatio: 103.2 / 99.3 ≈ 1.040. So 104.0%. Again, close to 104%, which is lower than 135%.\n\n11th ročník (11th grade):\n\n- Men: 20.6% of 300. 0.206 * 300 = 61.8 men.\n\n- Women: 13.8% of 300. 0.138 * 300 = 41.4 women.\n\nRatio: 61.8 / 41.4 ≈ 1.491. That's 149.1%. Hmm, 149% is pretty close to 135%, but let's check the other years.\n\n12th ročník (12th grade):\n\n- Men: 11.6% of 300. 0.116 * 300 = 34.8 men.\n\n- Women: 8.6% of 300. 0.086 * 300 = 25.8 women.\n\nRatio: 34.8 / 25.8 ≈ 1.347. That's 134.7%, which is just 0.3% less than 135%. So 134.7% is very close to 135%. \n\nWait, so the 12th grade has a ratio of approximately 134.7%, which is 0.3% off, whereas the 11th grade is 149.1%, which is 14.1% over. So the 12th grade is much closer. \n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\nStarting with the 9th grade:\n\n41.1% of 300: 0.411 * 300. 0.4 * 300 = 120, 0.011 * 300 = 3.3, so total 123.3. Correct.\n\n39.4% of 300: 0.394 * 300. 0.4 * 300 is 120, subtract 0.006 * 300 = 1.8, so 120 - 1.8 = 118.2. Correct. Ratio 123.3 / 118.2. Let me divide 123.3 by 118.2:\n\n118.2 * 1 = 118.2\n\n123.3 - 118.2 = 5.1\n\nSo 1 + (5.1 / 118.2) ≈ 1 + 0.043 = 1.043. So 104.3%. Correct.\n\n10th grade:\n\n34.4% of 300: 0.344 * 300. 0.3*300=90, 0.044*300=13.2, total 103.2. Correct.\n\n33.1% of 300: 0.331*300. 0.3*300=90, 0.031*300=9.3, total 99.3. Correct. Ratio 103.2 / 99.3.\n\n103.2 - 99.3 = 3.9. So 1 + 3.9 / 99.3 ≈ 1 + 0.039 ≈ 1.039. So 103.9%. Wait, earlier I had 104.0%, but actually 103.9%. Close enough, maybe rounding differences.\n\n11th grade:\n\n20.6% of 300: 0.206 * 300. 0.2*300=60, 0.006*300=1.8, total 61.8. Correct.\n\n13.8% of 300: 0.138*300=41.4. Correct. Ratio 61.8 / 41.4.\n\nLet me compute that: 41.4 * 1.5 = 62.1. So 61.8 is 62.1 - 0.3. So 1.5 - (0.3 / 41.4) ≈ 1.5 - 0.0072 ≈ 1.4928. So approximately 149.28%. Correct.\n\n12th grade:\n\n11.6% of 300: 0.116*300=34.8. Correct.\n\n8.6% of 300: 0.086*300=25.8. Correct. Ratio 34.8 /25.8.\n\nLet me compute this division. 25.8 * 1.3 = 33.54. 25.8 * 1.34 = 25.8*(1 + 0.3 + 0.04) = 25.8 + 7.74 + 1.032 = 34.572. That's very close to 34.8. So 1.34 + (0.228 /25.8). 0.228 /25.8 ≈ 0.0088. So total ratio ≈ 1.3488, which is 134.88%. So approximately 134.88%, which is 0.32% less than 135%. \n\nComparing to the 11th grade's 149.1%, which is 14.1% over. So the 12th grade is much closer. \n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't misread the question. The question says \"procentu cestujících autumnu v průzk attenuation studentů Central H.S.\" – maybe \"cestující\" is plural? But I think the percentages are per category (muži and Ženy). So each year, 300 men and 300 women were surveyed. So the numbers I calculated are correct. \n\nThe question is asking for the year where the number of men taking the bus is closest to 135% of the number of women taking the bus. So the ratio (men / women) should be closest to 1.35 (since 135% is 1.35). \n\nSo for each year, compute (men taking bus) / (women taking bus) and see which is closest to 1.35. \n\nSo for 9th grade: 123.3 / 118.2 ≈ 1.043 (104.3%)\n\n10th grade: 103.2 /99.3 ≈1.039 (103.9%)\n\n11th grade: 61.8 /41.4 ≈1.491 (149.1%)\n\n12th grade:34.8 /25.8 ≈1.348 (134.8%)\n\nSo 134.8% vs. 135%. The difference is |134.8 -135| =0.2%\n\nFor 11th grade: |149.1 -135|=14.1%\n\nSo yes, 12th grade is the closest. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the 12th ročník (12th grade). \n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe there's a different way to interpret the question. Is it possible that \"135% of the number of female students\" compared to male students? But no, the way it's phrased is \"the number of male students is closest to 135% of the number of female students\". So the ratio of male to female is 135%, so male = 1.35 * female. Hence, male / female =1.35. \n\nYes, so my calculation is correct. The ratio (men / women) needs to be closest to 1.35. \n\nSo 12th grade is 1.348, which is 0.2% less than 1.35. The next closest is 11th grade at 1.491, which is 14.1% higher. So 12th grade is the answer. \n\nWait a second, but 1.348 is 134.8%, which is 0.32% less than 135%. The problem says \"nejblíže 135%\". So 135% is the target. Since 134.8 is only 0.32% less, and the next closest is 149.1%, which is 14.1% more. Therefore, 12th grade is the closest. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th ročník. \n\nBut let me check once again, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, the original question says: \"Pro který ročník je počet mužských cestujících fiestu v průzků s nejblíží $135\\%$ počtu ženských cestující fiestu v průzků?\" So \"which year has the number of male students closest to 135% of the number of female students\". So yes, the ratio is male to female =135%, so male =1.35 * female. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. So the answer is 12th year. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is the 12th ročník, which is the 12th grade. In the table, the rows are 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th. So the answer is 12th ročník. \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in the format of the year written in digits or in words. The original table is in Czech, with \"ročník\" meaning year. So in the problem statement, the options are 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th. So the answer is 12th, which in the table is the last row. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th ročník, which in the box should be \\boxed{12} or \\boxed{12th}? The problem says \"nejblíže $135\\%$\". The options are given as 9th, 10th, etc., so probably the answer should be boxed as the number, like \\boxed{12}. But the original question in Czech might use \"12. ročník\" which is 12th year. But since the user mentioned \"30th percentile\" in the initial problem statement, which is 30th percentile, but that's probably a mistranslation. Wait, no, the user wrote \"30th percentile\" but in the data table, it's \"39.4%\" which is a percentage. \n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user wrote: \"30th percentile\" but that was probably a mistranslation or a typo. The data is in percentages. The original question in Czech might have been about deciles or something else, but in the table, it's clearly percentages. \n\nBut regardless, the answer is the 12th ročník, which is the 12th grade. Since the table lists them as 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, the answer is 12th. In the box, as per instructions, they might expect just the number, 12, boxed. \n\nBut in the original problem statement, the table has \"ročník\" as the column headers, so ", "answer": "12"}
{"original_question": "Vyřešte\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "question": "Vyřešte\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the inequality |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0. Hmm, absolute value in the numerator and a quadratic in the denominator. Alright, let's start by understanding the inequality step by step.\n\nFirst, the left side of the inequality is a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are expressions involving x. The inequality says this fraction is less than zero. For a fraction to be less than zero, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. That is, either the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. But since the numerator is an absolute value, which is always non-negative, right? Wait, absolute value is always non-negative, so |x² - 81| ≥ 0 for all x. So the numerator can't be negative. That means the only way the fraction is negative is if the numerator is positive (which it always is) and the denominator is negative. Wait, but if numerator is zero, the fraction is zero, which is not less than zero. So the inequality |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0 would hold when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative. But since the numerator is an absolute value, it's positive unless x² - 81 = 0. So x² - 81 = 0 when x = 9 or x = -9. Therefore, at x = 9 and x = -9, the numerator is zero, so the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So the solution will be all x where the denominator is negative, except x = 9 and x = -9. But wait, need to check if those x values where the denominator is negative are allowed (i.e., they don't make the denominator zero). Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the values of x where the denominator is negative. The denominator is x² - 36x. Let's factor that: x(x - 36). So x² - 36x = x(x - 36). So the denominator is zero when x = 0 or x = 36. So the denominator is negative when x(x - 36) < 0. To solve this inequality, let's find the critical points where the expression equals zero, which are x = 0 and x = 36. Then we can test intervals between these points.\n\nSo the critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n\n1. x < 0\n2. 0 < x < 36\n3. x > 36\n\nLet's test each interval.\n\nFirst interval: x < 0. Let's pick x = -1. Then x is negative, and x - 36 is negative (since -1 - 36 = -37). So the product x(x - 36) is (-)(-) = positive. So the denominator is positive here.\n\nSecond interval: 0 < x < 36. Let's pick x = 1. Then x is positive, and x - 36 is negative (1 - 36 = -35). So the product is (+)(-) = negative. So denominator is negative here.\n\nThird interval: x > 36. Let's pick x = 40. Then x is positive, x - 36 is positive (40 - 36 = 4). So product is (+)(+) = positive. So denominator is positive here.\n\nTherefore, the denominator x² - 36x is negative only in the interval (0, 36). But we must exclude x = 0 and x = 36 since the denominator can't be zero. So the denominator is negative when 0 < x < 36.\n\nBut the original inequality is |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0. Since the numerator is an absolute value, which is non-negative, the inequality will hold when the denominator is negative (as that would make the fraction negative). However, we must also ensure that the numerator is not zero, because if the numerator is zero, the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So when is |x² - 81| = 0? That occurs when x² - 81 = 0, so x = 9 or x = -9. So we need to exclude x = 9 and x = -9 from the solution set.\n\nBut wait, the denominator is negative in (0, 36). So x must be between 0 and 36, not including 0 and 36. But x = -9 is not in the interval (0, 36), so we only need to exclude x = 9 from the denominator's negative interval. However, x = 9 is in (0, 36), so we have to exclude x = 9.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is all x in (0, 36) except x = 9. But wait, let's check if x = 9 is in the interval where the denominator is negative. Yes, 9 is between 0 and 36. So x = 9 is in (0, 36), so we must exclude it. So the solution is 0 < x < 36, x ≠ 9.\n\nBut wait, let's verify this. Let's pick a test point in (0, 9), say x = 1. Then denominator is negative. The numerator is |1 - 81| = | -80 | = 80, which is positive. So 80 / negative = negative, which satisfies the inequality. So (0,9) is part of the solution.\n\nThen between 9 and 36, say x = 18. The denominator is still negative. The numerator is |18² - 81| = |324 - 81| = |243| = 243, which is positive. So 243 / negative = negative, so that interval is also part of the solution. But x = 9 is in (0, 36), so we exclude it. So the solution is (0,9) union (9,36).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let's check if x = 9 is the only point where the numerator is zero. The numerator is |x² - 81|. So when x² - 81 = 0, which is x = 9 or x = -9. So x = 9 is in the interval (0,36), but x = -9 is not. So in the interval (0,36), the numerator is zero only at x = 9. So we need to exclude x = 9. Therefore, the solution is (0,9) union (9,36).\n\nBut let's check with another test point in (9,36). Let's take x = 20. Then denominator is 20*(20 - 36) = 20*(-16) = -320, which is negative. The numerator is |20² - 81| = |400 - 81| = |319| = 319, positive. So 319 / -320 is negative, which satisfies the inequality. So that's good.\n\nWhat about x = 0? At x = 0, denominator is 0² - 36*0 = 0, which is undefined. So x = 0 is excluded. Similarly, x = 36: denominator is 36*(36 - 36) = 0, undefined. So excluded.\n\nWhat about x = -9? At x = -9, numerator is |(-9)^2 - 81| = |81 - 81| = 0, so the fraction is 0/(denominator). Denominator at x = -9 is (-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405, which is positive. So 0/405 = 0, which is not less than zero. So x = -9 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is all real numbers x where 0 < x < 36 and x ≠ 9. So in interval notation, that's (0, 9) U (9, 36).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me consider the numerator and denominator again. The numerator is |x² - 81|, which is always non-negative. The denominator is x² - 36x = x(x - 36). So denominator is negative when x is between 0 and 36, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is negative only when denominator is negative and numerator is positive. Since the numerator is positive except at x = 9 and x = -9, where it's zero, and x = -9 is not in the interval (0,36), so the only point to exclude is x = 9. Therefore, the solution is (0,36) excluding x = 9, which is (0,9) U (9,36).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be written as the union of intervals (0,9) and (9,36). So in boxed form, that would be \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n\nBut let me check once more. Let's take x = 4.5 (which is in (0,9)). Denominator is 4.5*(4.5 - 36) = 4.5*(-31.5) = negative. Numerator is |(4.5)^2 - 81| = |20.25 - 81| = | -60.75 | = 60.75. So 60.75 / negative = negative. So inequality holds.\n\nTake x = 18 (in (9,36)). Denominator is 18*(18 - 36) = 18*(-18) = -324. Numerator is |324 - 81| = 243. 243 / -324 = negative. So inequality holds.\n\nTake x = 9. The fraction is 0 / (81 - 324) = 0 / (-243) = 0. Not less than zero, so excluded.\n\nTake x = -9. The fraction is 0 / (81 + 324) = 0 / 405 = 0. Not less than zero. So excluded.\n\nTake x = 36. Denominator is 0, undefined. Excluded.\n\nTake x = 0. Denominator is 0, undefined. Excluded.\n\nTake x = 10. Denominator is 10*(10 - 36) = 10*(-26) = -260. Numerator is |100 - 81| = 19. 19/-260 < 0? Yes.\n\nSo all test cases confirm that between 0 and 36, excluding 9, the inequality holds. Therefore, the solution is indeed (0,9) U (9,36).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the inequality is \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\), we need to determine when the fraction is negative. \n\n1. **Numerator Analysis**: The numerator \\(|x^2 - 81|\\) is an absolute value, which is always non-negative. It is zero when \\(x^2 - 81 = 0\\), i.e., \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -9\\). Since we are looking for the fraction to be negative, the numerator must be positive, which occurs for all \\(x \\neq 9\\) and \\(x \\neq -9\\).\n\n2. **Denominator Analysis**: The denominator \\(x^2 - 36x\\) factors to \\(x(x - 36)\\). We need this to be negative:\n   - The critical points are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\).\n   - Testing intervals around these points, we find the denominator is negative in the interval \\((0, 36)\\).\n\n3. **Combining Conditions**: The fraction is negative when the numerator is positive (which is always true except at \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\)) and the denominator is negative (which occurs in \\((0, 36)\\)). However, we must exclude \\(x = 9\\) because the numerator is zero there, making the fraction zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n4. **Final Solution**: The solution is the interval \\((0, 36)\\) excluding \\(x = 9\\). This gives us the intervals \\((0, 9)\\) and \\((9, 36)\\).\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is \\(\\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}\\).", "answer": "(0,9) \\cup (9,36)"}

So, we have a rectangular field enclosed in an athletic track. The track is made up of two straight sections and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the maximum possible area of the field in square meters.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the track. The Asymptote code shows a green rectangle with two semicircles on the ends. The rectangle has a length of 3 units and a width of 2 units. The semicircles have a radius of 1 unit each. But in the problem, the actual dimensions are in meters. Hmm, maybe the units in the Asymptote code are scaled? Not sure, but maybe I can use variables for the length and width of the rectangle.\n\nLet me denote the length of the rectangular field as L meters and the width as W meters. Then, the track around it consists of two straight parts (the lengths of the rectangle) and two semicircular ends (each with radius r). The total perimeter of the track is given as 400 meters. \n\nSo, the perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sections plus the circumferences of the two semicircles. But two semicircles make up a full circle, so their combined circumference is 2πr. The two straight sections would each be the length of the rectangle, which is L. Wait, no. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is 3 units by 2 units, and the semicircles have radius 1 unit. So, maybe the length of the rectangle is 3 units, and the width is 2 units. The semicircles are on the ends, which would have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle. So, the radius of each semicircle would be half the width of the rectangle. That makes sense. So, if the width of the rectangle is W, then the radius of each semicircle is W/2.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (or circumference) of the track is the sum of the two straight parts (each of length L) and the circumference of the full circle (which is 2π*(W/2) = πW). So, total perimeter is 2L + πW = 400 meters.\n\nThe area of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is L * W. We need to maximize this area given the constraint 2L + πW = 400.\n\nSo, this is a typical optimization problem where we have to maximize a function (the area) subject to a constraint. To solve this, we can use calculus or maybe express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint and then substitute into the area formula.\n\nLet me try the substitution method. Let's solve the perimeter equation for L:\n\n2L + πW = 400  \n=> 2L = 400 - πW  \n=> L = (400 - πW)/2\n\nThen, the area A is L * W = [(400 - πW)/2] * W = (400W - πW²)/2\n\nSo, A(W) = (400W - πW²)/2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to W, set it to zero, and solve for W.\n\nFirst, let's compute dA/dW:\n\ndA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n200 - πW = 0  \nπW = 200  \nW = 200/π ≈ 63.66 meters\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for L:\n\nL = (400 - πW)/2  \n= (400 - π*(200/π))/2  \n= (400 - 200)/2  \n= 200/2  \n= 100 meters\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is L * W = 100 * (200/π) ≈ 100 * 63.66 ≈ 6366.19 square meters. But we can write the exact value as (200/π)*100 = 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977 square meters.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. Is there a step I missed?\n\nLet me verify. So, if we model the track as two straight sides of length L and two semicircular ends with radius r, then the total perimeter is 2L + 2*(πr) because two semicircles make a full circle. But in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is 3x2, and the semicircles have radius 1, which is half the width of the rectangle (since the width is 2 units). So, in general, if the width of the rectangle is W, then the radius of each semicircle is W/2, so the circumference contributed by the semicircles is 2*(π*(W/2)) = πW. Therefore, the total perimeter is 2L + πW = 400. So that seems right.\n\nThen, the area is L*W. Expressing L in terms of W gives L = (400 - πW)/2. Then, the area as a function of W is A(W) = [(400 - πW)/2]*W = (400W - πW²)/2. Taking derivative, A’(W) = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW. Setting to zero gives W = 200/π. Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. So, the answer should be 20000/π square meters, which is approximately 6366.20 m². But since the question asks for the exact value, we can leave it as 20000/π or rationalized in terms of π. Wait, but maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of π, so 20000/π is the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the problem might have different parameters. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is 3 units by 2 units, and the semicircles have radius 1 unit. So, in that case, the width of the rectangle is 2 units, so the semicircles have radius 1 unit. The perimeter would be 2*3 + 2*(π*1) = 6 + 2π ≈ 6 + 6.28 ≈ 12.28 units. So, in the problem, the perimeter is 400 meters, which is scaled up from the Asymptote code's 12.28 units. So, the scaling factor is 400 / (6 + 2π). But maybe we don't need to worry about scaling because we are dealing with variables and the relationship is proportional.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the perimeter equation is 2L + πW = 400. The area is L*W. The maximum area occurs when L = 100 meters and W = 200/π meters, giving area 20000/π m². So, that's the answer.\n\nBut let me just think again if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using calculus of variations or Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a single variable optimization after substitution, the method I used is correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that for a given perimeter, the rectangle with maximum area is a square, but here the perimeter isn't fixed; instead, the perimeter is a fixed length of the track, which includes the semicircles. So, it's a different constraint. If it were a simple rectangle with a fixed perimeter, then the maximum area is a square. But here, the perimeter is 400, but part of it is curved. So, the optimal dimensions will be different.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found that when the width is 200/π ≈ 63.66 meters and length is 100 meters, the area is maximized. Let's check if this makes sense. If we make the width smaller, then the radius of the semicircles is smaller, so the curved parts contribute less to the perimeter. Therefore, we can have a longer length. But increasing the length would increase the area, but the perimeter constraint must be maintained.\n\nAlternatively, if we make the width larger, then the radius of the semicircles is larger, which would take away from the length, which might decrease the area. So, there's a trade-off. The maximum occurs when the derivative is zero, which we found at W = 200/π and L = 100. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the problem: maximize A = L*W, subject to 2L + πW = 400.\n\nFormulate the Lagrangian: L = L*W + λ(400 - 2L - πW)\n\nTake partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂L = W - 2λ = 0  \n∂L/∂W = L - πλ = 0  \n∂L/∂λ = 400 - 2L - πW = 0\n\nFrom the first equation: W = 2λ  \nFrom the second equation: L = πλ  \nSubstitute λ from the first equation into the second: L = π*(W/2) => L = (π/2)W\n\nNow, substitute L = (π/2)W into the constraint equation:\n\n2L + πW = 400  \n2*(π/2)W + πW = 400  \nπW + πW = 400  \n2πW = 400  \nW = 200/π\n\nThen, L = (π/2)*(200/π) = 100, which matches our previous result. So, this confirms that the maximum area occurs when W = 200/π and L = 100, giving area 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20000/π square meters. To check if this is the case, perhaps compute the numerical value. 20000 divided by π is approximately 20000 / 3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. So, approximately 6366.20 m². But since the problem asks for the answer in square meters and doesn't specify rounding, we should present the exact value, which is 20000/π.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area is 20000/π square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum possible area of the field is \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}} square meters.\n</think>\n\nGiven a rectangular field enclosed in an athletic track, the track consists of two straight sections and two semicircular ends.

The Asymptote code shows there's a right angle at S, with sides ST and SR, and the hypotenuse RT. The label says RT is 5 units long. They also mention that sin R is 2/5, and we need to find sin T. Hmm, let me visualize this.\n\nFirst, since it's a triangle with a right angle at S, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S. So angle S is 90 degrees, angle R and angle T are the other two angles. The hypotenuse is RT, which is 5 units. They give sin R = 2/5, and we need to find sin T.\n\nLet me recall some trigonometry in right-angled triangles. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So for angle R, which is at vertex R, the opposite side would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT. So sin R = ST / RT. Given that sin R = 2/5, and RT is 5, then ST should be 2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf sin R = opposite / hypotenuse = ST / RT = 2/5, and RT is 5, then ST = 2. So the side opposite angle R, which is ST, is 2 units long. Then, the other leg of the triangle, which is RS, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since RT is the hypotenuse, RT = 5, so RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2. Plugging in the known values: RS^2 + 2^2 = 5^2. That is, RS^2 + 4 = 25. So RS^2 = 25 - 4 = 21. Therefore, RS = sqrt(21). That's the length of the other leg.\n\nNow, we need to find sin T. Sin T is the sine of angle T, which is at vertex T. In a right-angled triangle, sin T would be the opposite side over the hypotenuse. The side opposite angle T is RS, which we found to be sqrt(21). The hypotenuse is still RT = 5. So sin T = RS / RT = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nWait, let me confirm. In triangle RST, angle T is at point T, which is the right-angled vertex. So the sides adjacent to angle T are TS and RT. Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle RST, right-angled at S. So the sides are:\n\n- RT is the hypotenuse, length 5.\n\n- ST is one leg, length 2.\n\n- RS is the other leg, length sqrt(21).\n\nSo angle T is at point T. The sides adjacent to angle T are TS and RT. Wait, angle T is at the right-angled vertex S? Wait, no. Wait, the triangle is RST, with right angle at S. So the vertices are R, S, T. The right angle is at S, so sides RS and ST are the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse. Then, angle R is at vertex R, angle T is at vertex T, and angle S is at vertex S (the right angle).\n\nSo angle T is at point T. The side opposite angle T is RS, which is sqrt(21). The hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. Therefore, sin T = opposite / hypotenuse = RS / RT = sqrt(21)/5. So that's the answer. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is right-angled, angles R and T must add up to 90 degrees. Therefore, sin T = cos R. If sin R = 2/5, then cos R = sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Which is the same as sin T. So that's another way to see it: in a right-angled triangle, the sine of one angle is the cosine of the other. Therefore, sin T = cos R = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

That is, I need to find the x-values such that f(x) = 0 and f(x) = 6, then add those x-values together. Let me start by recalling the definition of the function f(x). It's piecewise: for x less than or equal to 3, f(x) = 3 - x, and for x greater than 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. \n\nFirst, let's tackle f⁻¹(0). That means I need to find all x where f(x) = 0. Since the function is defined differently for x ≤3 and x >3, I need to check both intervals.\n\nStarting with x ≤3: f(x) = 3 - x. Set that equal to 0: 3 - x = 0 → x = 3. Since 3 is the boundary point, and the interval includes 3, so x=3 is a valid solution here. \n\nNow check the other interval: x >3. Here, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set that equal to 0: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factor out an x: x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. So the solutions are x=0 or -x² + 2x + 3 =0. But since we are in the interval x >3, x=0 is not in this interval, so we can ignore that. Solve -x² + 2x +3 =0. Multiply both sides by -1: x² -2x -3=0. Factor: (x -3)(x +1)=0 → x=3 or x=-1. But again, in the interval x>3, neither 3 nor -1 are in this interval. So there are no solutions in x>3 for f(x)=0. Therefore, the only solution is x=3. Hence, f⁻¹(0) = 3.\n\nNow moving on to f⁻¹(6). Similarly, find x such that f(x)=6. Again, check both intervals.\n\nFirst interval: x ≤3. f(x) =3 -x. Set equal to 6: 3 -x =6 → -x=3 → x=-3. Check if x=-3 is ≤3. Yes, it is. So x=-3 is a solution here.\n\nSecond interval: x>3. f(x)= -x³ +2x² +3x. Set equal to 6: -x³ +2x² +3x =6. Bring 6 to the left: -x³ +2x² +3x -6 =0. Let's factor this cubic equation. Maybe try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Let's test x=1: -1 +2 +3 -6 = -2 ≠0. x=2: -8 +8 +6 -6=0. Oh, x=2 is a root. Wait, but 2 is not in x>3. So x=2 is not in the interval we are considering. So factor out (x-2). Using polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide -x³ +2x² +3x -6 by (x -2). Let's use synthetic division. Coefficients: -1, 2, 3, -6. Root at 2:\n\nBring down -1. Multiply by 2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) =0. Multiply by 2:0. Add to next coefficient:3 +0=3. Multiply by 2:6. Add to last coefficient: -6 +6=0. So the cubic factors as (x -2)(-x² +0x +3) = (x -2)(-x² +3). So set equal to zero: (x -2)(-x² +3)=0. So solutions are x=2, and -x² +3=0 → x²=3 → x=√3 or x=-√3. Now, check these in the interval x>3. x=2 is not in x>3. x=√3 ≈1.732, which is not in x>3. x=-√3 ≈-1.732, also not in x>3. So none of these roots are in the interval x>3. Therefore, the only solution in the interval x>3 is none. Therefore, the only solution is x=-3 from the first interval. Hence, f⁻¹(6)= -3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. For x>3, the equation -x³ +2x² +3x =6. When x=2, which is not in x>3, that gives 0. So in the interval x>3, the equation -x³ +2x² +3x -6=0. Let's plug in x=4: -64 +32 +12 -6= -26 ≠0. x=5: -125 +50 +15 -6= -66 ≠0. x=3: -27 +18 +9 -6=0. But x=3 is the boundary. So in x>3, we need to see if there's any solution. Let me analyze the function f(x)= -x³ +2x² +3x for x>3. Let's compute its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing. f’(x) = -3x² +4x +3. Let's see the critical points. Set derivative to zero: -3x² +4x +3=0. Multiply by -1: 3x² -4x -3=0. Solutions: x=(4 ±√(16 +36))/6=(4±√52)/6=(4±2√13)/6=(2±√13)/3. √13≈3.605, so critical points are (2 +3.605)/3≈5.605/3≈1.868 and (2 -3.605)/3≈-1.605/3≈-0.535. So the derivative is zero at x≈1.868 and x≈-0.535. So the function f(x) for x>3 has derivative f’(x)= -3x² +4x +3. Let's plug in x=3: f’(3)= -27 +12 +3= -12 <0. So at x=3, the derivative is negative. So the function is decreasing at x=3. Since the critical points are at x≈1.868 and x≈-0.535, which are left of 3, so for x>3, the derivative is negative, meaning the function is decreasing. So f(x) for x>3 is decreasing. Let's compute f(3): -27 + 18 +9=0. So f(3)=0. Then, since the function is decreasing for x>3, as x increases beyond 3, f(x) decreases from 0 to negative infinity. Therefore, for x>3, f(x) is less than 0. Therefore, the equation f(x)=6 has no solutions in x>3. So the only solution is x=-3. Therefore, f⁻¹(6)= -3.\n\nTherefore, f⁻¹(0) + f⁻¹(6)=3 + (-3)=0. Wait, that seems too easy. Let me check again.\n\nFor f⁻¹(0): we found x=3. For f⁻¹(6): x=-3. So 3 + (-3)=0. Hmm. Let me verify again.\n\nFirst, f⁻¹(0): solving f(x)=0.\n\nFor x ≤3: 3 -x=0 →x=3. Valid.\n\nFor x>3: -x³ +2x² +3x=0. We factored as x(-x² +2x +3)=0. Solutions x=0, -1, 3. But x>3, so x=3 is the boundary, but 3 is not included in x>3. So no solutions here. So only x=3.\n\nThen f⁻¹(6): solving f(x)=6.\n\nFor x ≤3: 3 -x=6 →x=-3. Valid.\n\nFor x>3: -x³ +2x² +3x=6. Which becomes -x³ +2x² +3x -6=0. We found roots at x=2, x=√3, x=-√3. But x>3, none of these roots are in that interval. So only solution is x=-3.\n\nThus, the sum is 3 + (-3)=0. So the answer is 0. That seems correct. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe graphing both functions. For f(x)=3 -x when x ≤3, which is a line decreasing from ( -∞,3) to (3,0). Then for x>3, f(x)= -x³ +2x² +3x. At x=3, it's 0. For x>3, it's a cubic function. Let's plug in x=4: -64 +32 +12= -20. So f(4)=-20. So as x increases beyond 3, f(x) decreases. So the inverse function for f(x)=0 is x=3, which is the boundary. For f(x)=6, since f(x) for x ≤3 is 3 -x, which at x=-3 gives 6. Then for x>3, f(x) is less than 0, so 6 can't be achieved there. So yes, only x=-3. Therefore, sum is 3 + (-3)=0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \\) for the piecewise function \\( f(x) \\), we need to determine the values of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 6 \\).\n\n1. **Finding \\( f^{-1}(0) \\):**\n   - For \\( x \\leq 3 \\), \\( f(x) = 3 - x \\).

The problem is about a regular octahedron, right? There are six vertices, and the distances from a point P to five of them are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polyhedrons, there might be some symmetry or properties that relate distances from a point inside to the vertices. Maybe something like coordinates?\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular octahedron looks like. It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases. So, there are two apex points, one at the top and one at the bottom, and then a square in the middle. Alternatively, it can be thought of as having six vertices: the top, bottom, and four around the middle forming a square. Wait, the Asymptote code shows the vertices A(1,0,0), B(-1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,-1,0), E(0,0,1), F(0,0,-1). So, these are the six vertices. Let me confirm that. The octahedron with these coordinates: vertices A, B on the x-axis, C, D on the y-axis, and E, F on the z-axis. Each of these is a unit distance from the origin, so the edges would be between adjacent vertices. For example, A is connected to C, D, E, and F? Wait, no. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the edges are drawn: A--C, A--D, A--E, A--F, and then C--E--D--F--cycle, and B--C--D--F--cycle. Hmm, maybe it's not the standard octahedron. Wait, maybe the coordinates are different.\n\nWait, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), F is (0,0,-1). So, actually, each vertex is a unit vector along each axis. So, for example, A(1,0,0) is connected to C(0,1,0), D(0,-1,0), E(0,0,1), and F(0,0,-1)? But in the Asymptote code, it draws A--C, A--D, A--E, A--F. Then, C--E--D--F--cycle. So, C is connected to E and D? Wait, C is (0,1,0), E is (0,0,1), D is (0,-1,0). So, C is connected to E and maybe D? Wait, C--E--D--F--cycle would be C connected to E, E connected to D, D connected to F, and F connected to C? But F is (0,0,-1). So, that edge would be from D(0,-1,0) to F(0,0,-1). Hmm. So, in this case, the octahedron is dual to a cube? Because the edges are between the axes. So, each vertex is connected to the four others along the coordinate axes. Wait, but in a regular octahedron, each vertex is connected to four others. Let me check the coordinates.\n\nEach vertex is at a unit distance from the origin, so the edges would be between vertices that are orthogonal? Wait, no. If two vertices are orthogonal, their distance would be sqrt(2), since the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(2). So, each vertex is connected to the four vertices that are orthogonal to it. So, each vertex has four edges, forming a regular octahedron. So, the edge length here is sqrt(2), since the distance between adjacent vertices is sqrt(2). So, the regular octahedron in this coordinate system has edge length sqrt(2). Got it.\n\nNow, the problem states that the distances from point P to five of the six vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Hmm. The Asymptote code has point P at (1.2, 1.5, 1). So, P is outside the octahedron. The distances from P to each vertex are given for five vertices, and we need the sixth.\n\nI need to recall if there's a property or theorem related to distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octahedron. I remember in some cases, like for a regular tetrahedron, there's a relation involving the sum of squares of distances. Maybe something similar applies here?\n\nLet me think. For a regular tetrahedron, if you take any point in space, the sum of the squares of the distances from that point to the four vertices is equal to four times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to each vertex. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in a regular octahedron, there is a similar formula. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry. If I can assign coordinates to the point P and then express the distances to each vertex, maybe set up equations and solve for the coordinates. But that might be complicated with five distances given. Wait, but there are six vertices, so only five distances are given. Hmm. Maybe the coordinates can be determined using the given distances, and then the sixth distance can be found.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a relationship between the distances. Let me recall that in a regular octahedron, the vertices are at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). So, each vertex is a unit vector along each axis. So, the coordinates of the vertices are all permutations of (±1, 0, 0), etc., but in this case, they are at (±1,0,0), (0,±1,0), (0,0,±1). Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), F is (0,0,-1). So, each vertex is a unit vector along the x, y, or z-axis. So, that's a regular octahedron centered at the origin with edge length sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the point P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Let's check the distance from P to each vertex. Let's compute the distances for all six vertices. Wait, but maybe the Asymptote code is just an illustration, and the actual problem might have different coordinates? Wait, the problem says \"the distances from point P to five of the six vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Find the distance to the sixth vertex.\"\n\nSo, in general, regardless of the coordinates of P, given the distances to five vertices, find the sixth. So, maybe there's a formula or a property here. Let me think.\n\nI recall that in some cases, for regular polyhedrons, there are relationships between the distances from a point to the vertices. For example, in a cube, there's a formula involving the sum of the squares of the distances. Wait, perhaps similar here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the regular octahedron is dual to the cube. Maybe properties from the cube can be used here. Alternatively, use coordinates.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinates. Let me denote the six vertices as follows:\n\nA: (1, 0, 0)\n\nB: (-1, 0, 0)\n\nC: (0, 1, 0)\n\nD: (0, -1, 0)\n\nE: (0, 0, 1)\n\nF: (0, 0, -1)\n\nSo, each vertex is a unit vector along the x, y, or z-axis.\n\nLet point P have coordinates (x, y, z). Then, the distance from P to each vertex is:\n\nPA = sqrt((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nPB = sqrt((x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nPC = sqrt(x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2)\n\nPD = sqrt(x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2)\n\nPE = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2)\n\nPF = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2)\n\nNow, the problem states that the distances to five of these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and we need to find the sixth. But which one is missing? The problem doesn't specify which five are given, so perhaps the answer is unique regardless of which five are chosen? Or maybe there's a specific arrangement.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code shows P at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Let's compute the distances from this point to each vertex.\n\nCompute PA: sqrt((1.2 - 1)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 2.25 + 1) = sqrt(3.29) ≈ 1.813\n\nPB: sqrt((1.2 + 1)^2 + 1.5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2.2^2 + 2.25 + 1) = sqrt(4.84 + 2.25 + 1) = sqrt(8.09) ≈ 2.844\n\nPC: sqrt(1.2^2 + (1.5 - 1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.5^2 + 1) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.25 + 1) = sqrt(2.69) ≈ 1.640\n\nPD: sqrt(1.2^2 + (1.5 + 1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 2.5^2 + 1) = sqrt(1.44 + 6.25 + 1) = sqrt(8.69) ≈ 2.948\n\nPE: sqrt(1.2^2 + 1.5^2 + (1 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 2.25 + 0) = sqrt(3.69) ≈ 1.921\n\nPF: sqrt(1.2^2 + 1.5^2 + (1 + 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 2.25 + 4) = sqrt(7.69) ≈ 2.773\n\nBut in the problem, the distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, which are much larger. So, maybe P is not in the vicinity of the origin but further away. Wait, but the Asymptote code just draws P at (1.2, 1.5, 1), which is close to the origin. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is just for illustration, and the actual problem is with a different point P.\n\nSo, maybe the problem is more mathematical, not based on the specific coordinates given in the Asymptote code. So, perhaps the answer is 5? Wait, but 5 isn't among the given distances. Wait, the given distances are 3,7,8,9,11. The answer is likely an integer, given the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula here. Let me think. For a regular octahedron, the coordinates of the vertices are (±1,0,0), (0,±1,0), (0,0,±1). Let’s denote the distances from P(x,y,z) to each vertex as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6. Then, we have:\n\nd1^2 = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\nd2^2 = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\nd3^2 = x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2\n\nd4^2 = x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2\n\nd5^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2\n\nd6^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2\n\nNow, if we subtract d1^2 from d2^2, we get:\n\nd2^2 - d1^2 = [(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] = [x^2 + 2x + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1)] = 4x\n\nSimilarly, d3^2 - d4^2 = [(y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2] = 4y\n\nd5^2 - d6^2 = [(z + 1)^2 - (z - 1)^2] = 4z\n\nSo, from these, we can express x, y, z in terms of the squares of the distances.\n\nFor example:\n\n4x = d2^2 - d1^2\n\n4y = d3^2 - d4^2\n\n4z = d5^2 - d6^2\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = (d2^2 - d1^2)/4\n\ny = (d3^2 - d4^2)/4\n\nz = (d5^2 - d6^2)/4\n\nBut we need to figure out which distances correspond to which vertices. Wait, the problem states that the distances to five vertices are 3,7,8,9,11. Let's denote the given distances as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and the sixth is d6. But we don't know which ones are which. However, since the problem is to find the sixth distance, perhaps there's a relation that allows us to compute d6^2 in terms of the other distances.\n\nAlternatively, note that the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices can be expressed in terms of x, y, z.\n\nLet’s", "answer": "\\sqrt{66}"}

Hmm, I remember from physics that force equals mass times acceleration, right? So, F = m * a. That means acceleration is force divided by mass. \n\nThe question says Je wants to hit softball with the same force as Jack does with baseball. So, both the softball and baseball are hit with the same force F. The mass of the softball is 200 grams, and the baseball is 150 grams. We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball (Jen's ball) to the baseball (Jack's ball). \n\nLet me write down the formula for acceleration. For any object, a = F / m. So, for the baseball, a_baseball = F / m_baseball, and for the softball, a_softball = F / m_softball. \n\nSince both are hit with the same force F, we can set up the ratio of accelerations as a_softball / a_baseball = (F / m_softball) / (F / m_baseball). The F in the numerator and denominator should cancel out. \n\nSo that simplifies to (1 / m_softball) / (1 / m_baseball) = m_baseball / m_softball. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If you have (F/m1) divided by (F/m2), then it's (F/m1)*(m2/F) = m2/m1. Yes, exactly. The F cancels, and you get the ratio of the masses inversely. \n\nGiven the masses: softball is 200 g, baseball is 150 g. So the ratio of accelerations would be m_baseball / m_softball = 150 / 200. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 50: 150 ÷ 50 = 3, 200 ÷ 50 = 4. So 3/4. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the baseball is 3/4. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the order. The question asks for the ratio of Jen's ball (softball) to Jack's ball (baseball). So a_softball / a_baseball = 3/4. Yeah, that's correct. Because the softball is more massive, so when hit with the same force, it should accelerate less. So the ratio is smaller than 1, which matches 3/4. \n\nAlternatively, if I plug in the numbers: a_baseball = F / 150g, a_softball = F / 200g. So the ratio is (F/200g)/(F/150g) = (1/200)/(1/150) = 150/200 = 3/4. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be 3/4.\n</think>\n\nThe acceleration of an object is given by \\( a = \\frac{F}{m} \\).

I need to find out how many digits are common between the representations of the number 629 in base 10 when converted to base 7 and base 8. Hmm, so first, I should convert 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8, right? Then compare the digits of the two results and count how many are the same. \n\nStarting with base 7. To convert a decimal number to base 7, I divide the number by 7 and record the remainders. Let me do that step by step. \n\n629 divided by 7. Let's see, 7 times 89 is 623, which is 623. So 629 minus 623 is 6. So the remainder is 6. So the least significant digit (rightmost) is 6. Then take 89 and divide by 7. 7 times 12 is 84, so remainder is 5. Next, divide 12 by 7: 7 times 1 is 7, remainder 5. Then 1 divided by 7 is 0 with remainder 1. So putting the remainders together from last to first: 1, 5, 5, 6. So 629 in base 7 is 1556₇. Let me check that: 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7 + 6. 7^3 is 343, 5*49 is 245, 5*7 is 35, and 6. Adding those up: 343 + 245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Yep, that works.\n\nNow converting 629 to base 8. Let's do the same division method. 629 divided by 8. 8*78 is 624, so remainder is 5. So least significant digit is 5. Then 78 divided by 8: 8*9 is 72, remainder 6. Next, 9 divided by 8: 8*1 is 8, remainder 1. Then 1 divided by 8 is 0 with remainder 1. So the remainders from last to first: 1, 1, 6, 5. So 629 in base 8 is 1165₈. Let me verify: 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8 + 5. 512 + 64 + 48 + 5 = 512 + 64 is 576, plus 48 is 624, plus 5 is 629. Correct.\n\nNow, the representations are 1556₇ and 1165₈. I need to see which digits are common in both. Let's write them out:\n\nBase 7: 1 5 5 6\nBase 8: 1 1 6 5\n\nComparing each digit position:\n\nFirst digit (leftmost): 1 vs 1 – same.\nSecond digit: 5 vs 1 – different.\nThird digit: 5 vs 6 – different.\nFourth digit: 6 vs 5 – different.\n\nSo only the first digit is the same. Wait, but hold on, in the base 8 number, the digits are 1,1,6,5 and in base 7 it's 1,5,5,6. So overlapping digits are 1, 5, 5, 6 in base 7 and 1,1,6,5 in base 8. So comparing each digit:\n\nFirst digit: 1 (both)\nSecond digit: 5 vs 1 (different)\nThird digit: 5 vs 6 (different)\nFourth digit: 6 vs 5 (different)\n\nSo only the first digit is the same. Therefore, there is one common digit. But wait, the problem statement says that 121₃ and 413₅ have one common digit. So maybe I need to check if there's another digit that appears in both numbers? Wait, but 1556₇ and 1165₈. Let me list all digits in each number.\n\nIn base 7: digits are 1,5,5,6.\nIn base 8: digits are 1,1,6,5.\n\nSo the digits in base 7 are 1,5,5,6 and in base 8 are 1,1,6,5. So overlapping digits are 1,5,6. But each digit's count? Wait, the question says \"how many digits are common\". Wait, it could be interpreted as how many digits are the same in the same position? Or just how many digits appear in both numbers regardless of position? The original example says 121₃ and 413₅ have one common digit. Let's check that example. 121₃: digits 1,2,1. 413₅: digits 4,1,3. The common digits are 1. So only one digit. So in that case, it's counting the number of distinct digits that appear in both numbers. So in the example, 1 is present in both, so one common digit. So in this problem, maybe we need to count how many distinct digits are present in both numbers. So 1556₇ digits are 1,5,5,6. So distinct digits: 1,5,6. In base 8, 1165₈ digits are 1,1,6,5. Distinct digits: 1,6,5. So the common digits are 1,5,6 in both. So three digits. Wait, but that contradicts the example. Wait, in the example, 121₃ and 413₅. The first has digits 1,2,1 and the second has 4,1,3. The common digits are 1. So only one digit. But according to this, if we count the distinct digits that appear in both, it would be 1. So that's the same. Wait, maybe in the problem, it's the number of distinct digits that appear in both numbers. So in this problem, 1556 and 1165, the common digits are 1,5,6. So three digits. But in the example, 121 and 413, the common digits are 1. So one digit. But in the problem, the answer is three? But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, but maybe I need to check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Kolik stejných číslic se nacháží v reprezDtacích čísla 629_{10} v základu 7 a základu 8?\" (How many digits are present in the representations of the number 629 in base 10 in base 7 and base 8?) The example given is 121₃ and 413₅ with one common digit. So in the example, the digits of 121₃ are 1, 2, 1 and of 413₅ are 4, 1, 3. The common digit is 1. So only one digit. So the question is asking for how many digits are common between the two representations, regardless of their positions. So each digit in the base 7 number and see if it's present in the base 8 number, and count how many distinct digits are shared. So for 1556 (base 7) and 1165 (base 8). So digits in base 7: 1,5,5,6. Digits in base 8: 1,1,6,5. So the shared digits are 1,5,6. Three digits. So the answer is three. But in the example, 121₃ and 413₅, the shared digit is 1. So the answer would be one. So according to the problem statement, the answer is three. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for how many digits are the same in the same position. For example, in the first digit, 1 vs 1, so that's one. Then other digits are different. So only one digit. But that contradicts the example. Wait, in the example, if you compare 121₃ and 413₅, they have the same number of digits? 121 has 3 digits, 413 has 3 digits. But 121 and 413: first digit 1 vs 4, different; second digit 2 vs 1, different; third digit 1 vs 3, different. So no digits in the same position are the same. So the example's answer is one, which must be the count of distinct digits common to both numbers, not the same positions. So in that case, the answer here would be three. But maybe the problem is different. Wait, the problem says \"how many digits are common\". So maybe in the two representations, how many digits are present in both numbers. So for example, in base 7: 1,5,5,6. In base 8: 1,1,6,5. So the digits present in both are 1,5,6. So three distinct digits. So answer is three. But the example given is 121₃ and 413₅ with one common digit, which is 1. So three in the problem. But maybe in the problem, the answer is one? Wait, maybe in the problem, it's the number of digits that are in the same position and equal. So first digit 1, second digit 5 vs 1, third digit 5 vs 6, fourth digit 6 vs 5. So only the first digit is the same. So answer is one. But that contradicts the example. Wait, in the example, if you compare 121₃ and 413₅, the digits are 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. The common digits in the same position: only the second digit, which is 2 and 1, so different. So no digits in the same position are the same. So answer is zero? But the example says one. Hmm. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering all digits in both representations, not just in the same position. So how many distinct digits are in both base 7 and base 8 representations. So base 7 digits: 1,5,5,6. Base 8 digits:1,1,6,5. The union is 1,5,6. So three digits. But the example says \"121₃ a 413₅ by náčlend 1\". So maybe the answer is three. But let's check both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for digits that appear in both representations, regardless of position, then the answer is three. If it's asking for digits that are in the same position and equal, then the answer is one. But the example seems to suggest that the former is the case. Because in the example, the digits are 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. The common digits are 1, which is present in both numbers. So even though it's not in the same position, they just have the digit 1 in their sets. So if the problem is asking for the number of distinct digits that are present in both representations, then the answer is three. However, if it's asking for the number of digits that are the same in the same position, then it's one. But since the example is considered to have one common digit, which is 1, even though it's not in the same position, maybe the problem counts the number of distinct digits common to both representations. So in the problem's case, the answer would be three. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of digits that are the same in both representations, considering all positions. So for each digit in base 7, check if it's present in base 8, and vice versa, and count the intersection. So for example, digits in base 7:1,5,5,6. In base 8:1,1,6,5. The intersection is 1,5,6. So three digits. So answer is three. But the example given in the problem statement: 121₃ a 413₅ have one common digit. Let's see, digits in 121₃:1,2,1; digits in 413₅:4,1,3. The intersection is 1. So only one digit. So that's three digits. So that's consistent. So in the problem, the answer is three. However, in the initial conversion, I got 1556₇ and 1165₈. Wait, but 1556 in base 7 is 1,5,5,6. 1165 in base 8 is 1,1,6,5. So the digits 1,5,6 are present in both. So three digits. Therefore, the answer is three. But the problem statement's example seems to suggest that the answer is one. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Maybe it's asking for the number of digits that are the same in both representations, considering all digits, not just distinct. Wait, but in the example, 121 and 413, the digits are 1,2,1 vs 4,1,3. The common digits are 1 (appearing twice in the first number and once in the second). But the problem says \"how many digits are common\", which is ambiguous. But in the example, the answer is one, which is the number of distinct digits. So maybe the problem is asking for the number of distinct digits common to both numbers. So in the given problem, the answer would be three. But let's check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nConverting 629 to base 7: 1556₇.\n\nConverting 629 to base 8: 1165₈.\n\nDigits in base 7: 1,5,5,6.\n\nDigits in base 8:1,1,6,5.\n\nCommon digits: 1,5,6. So three distinct digits. Therefore, the answer is three. So I think that is the case. But maybe I need to check if there is a different interpretation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for how many digits are the same in both representations, regardless of their positions. So, for example, if a", "answer": "3"}

The original polynomial f(x) is given as 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. Because if you plug in 1 for every x, each term becomes just the coefficient times 1 to some power, which is 1, so you just add up all the coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) would be g(1). But since g(x) is f(x - 1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). Wait, is that right? Let me verify.\n\nIf g(x) = f(x - 1), then substituting x = 1 into g(x) gives g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). So, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is equal to f(0). That seems correct because when you expand g(x), the coefficients are the same as f(x) but shifted by 1 in the argument. But the sum of the coefficients is independent of the variable, so evaluating at x = 1 in g(x) gives the sum of its coefficients, which is the same as evaluating f(0). That makes sense. So instead of expanding the entire polynomial, I can just compute f(0). Let me check.\n\nGiven f(x) = 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Plugging in x = 0, all the terms with x in them will vanish, leaving just the constant term. So f(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2. Is that the answer? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand f(x - 1) and then add up the coefficients. Let's try that method to verify. Expanding f(x - 1) would mean substituting (x - 1) wherever there is an x in the original polynomial. So:\n\nf(x - 1) = 3(x - 1)^4 + 5(x - 1)^2 - 9(x - 1) - 2.\n\nNow, I need to expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 3(x - 1)^4.\n\nLet me compute (x - 1)^4. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1.\n\nMultiplying by 3: 3x^4 - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.\n\nSecond term: 5(x - 1)^2.\n\nCompute (x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5: 5x² - 10x + 5.\n\nThird term: -9(x - 1) = -9x + 9.\n\nFourth term: -2.\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\nFirst term: 3x^4 -12x³ +18x² -12x +3\n\nSecond term: +5x² -10x +5\n\nThird term: -9x +9\n\nFourth term: -2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x^4 (only term with x^4)\n\n-12x³ (only term with x³)\n\n18x² +5x² = 23x²\n\n-12x -10x -9x = (-12 -10 -9)x = -31x\n\nConstants: 3 +5 +9 -2 = (3 +5) + (9 -2) = 8 +7 =15\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ng(x) = 3x⁴ -12x³ +23x² -31x +15.\n\nNow, sum of the coefficients is 3 + (-12) +23 + (-31) +15.\n\nCalculating that: 3 -12 = -9; -9 +23 =14; 14 -31 = -17; -17 +15 = -2. So the sum is indeed -2. That matches the result from evaluating f(0). So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.\n\nBut let me just recap why the first method works. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial at x =1. Because when you substitute x =1, each term becomes coefficient * 1^k = coefficient, so you just add them up. However, since g(x) = f(x -1), substituting x =1 into g(x) gives f(1 -1) = f(0). Therefore, the sum of coefficients of g(x) is f(0). This is a useful shortcut because it avoids the tedious expansion. But it's good to verify with both methods to ensure that there's no mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember that trick, expanding would have been the way to go, but it's definitely more time-consuming. So in an exam setting, knowing that evaluating at x=1 gives the sum of coefficients can save time. But since both methods confirm the answer, I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAnother sanity check: if we have a polynomial shifted by 1, does shifting affect the sum of coefficients? Well, in this case, shifting the polynomial's argument changes the coefficients, but the sum after shifting is f(0), which is a different value than f(1). Wait, but in this case, since we're evaluating at x=1 for g(x), which is f(0), that's a fixed value. So, yes, the sum of coefficients of g(x) is f(0). So this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the sum of coefficients of f(x), that would be f(1). For f(1): 3*(1)^4 +5*(1)^2 -9*(1) -2 = 3 +5 -9 -2 = (3+5) - (9+2) =8 -11 = -3. But that's not the case here. The question is about g(x) = f(x-1), so sum of coefficients is g(1) = f(0) = -2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is \\boxed{-2}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\), which is equal to \\( f(x-1) \\), we note that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\). \n\nGiven \\( g(x) = f(x-1) \\), the sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( g(1) \\).

Vyjádřete svou odpověď v nejjednodušší radikální formě.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2. Hmm, let's see. I remember there's a formula for the distance from a point to a line. But wait, how does that work exactly? Let me recall. I think it's something like |Ax + By + C| divided by the square root of A squared plus B squared, right? But first, I need to write the equation of the line in the standard form, which is Ax + By + C = 0. \n\nThe given line is y = 2x - 2. Let me rearrange that. Subtract 2x from both sides: -2x + y + 2 = 0. So, in standard form, A is -2, B is 1, and C is 2. But the formula is |A*x0 + B*y0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²), where (x0, y0) is the point. Wait, but in my rearranged equation, the coefficients are A = -2, B = 1, and C = 2. Let me check: if I plug into the formula, it would be |-2*6 + 1*0 + 2| / sqrt((-2)^2 + 1^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, the numerator: |-12 + 0 + 2| = |-10| = 10. Then the denominator: sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So the distance is 10 / sqrt(5). But that's not simplified. The problem says to express it in the simplest radical form. So 10 divided by sqrt(5) can be rationalized. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (10*sqrt(5)) / 5 = 2*sqrt(5). So the distance is 2√5. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in rearranging the equation. The original line is y = 2x - 2. When I rearrange to standard form, it's 2x - y - 2 = 0. Wait, that's a different standard form. Wait, hold on. Let me check again. Starting with y = 2x - 2. Subtract 2x from both sides: -2x + y + 2 = 0. Alternatively, subtract y: 2x - y - 2 = 0. Either way, both are correct. But in standard form, Ax + By + C = 0, so if I write 2x - y - 2 = 0, then A is 2, B is -1, C is -2. Wait, but the formula is |A*x0 + B*y0 + C|. So substituting (6,0) into 2x - y -2, we get 2*6 -0 -2 = 12 -2 = 10. So |10| is 10, and the denominator is sqrt(2² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So same result: 10 / sqrt(5) = 2√5. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use calculus to find the minimum distance. Let's see. The distance from a point (x, y) to (6,0) is sqrt((x -6)^2 + (y -0)^2). But since the point (x, y) lies on the line y = 2x -2, we can substitute y into the distance formula. So distance squared would be (x -6)^2 + (2x -2)^2. To minimize the distance, we can minimize the square of the distance, which is easier. \n\nLet me set up the function f(x) = (x -6)^2 + (2x -2)^2. Then take the derivative, set it to zero, and solve for x. Let's compute f'(x):\n\nFirst, expand f(x): (x^2 -12x +36) + (4x^2 -8x +4) = 5x^2 -20x +40. Then derivative f'(x) = 10x -20. Setting this equal to zero: 10x -20 = 0 → x = 2. Then y = 2*2 -2 = 2. So the closest point on the line is (2,2). Then the distance from (2,2) to (6,0) is sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(16 +4) = sqrt(20) = 2√5. \n\nSo same result. So whether I use the formula or calculus, I get 2√5. That seems consistent. So the answer is 2√5. \n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe projection. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the length of the perpendicular segment from the point to the line. So if I can find the equation of the line perpendicular to y =2x -2 that passes through (6,0), then find the intersection point, and compute the distance. \n\nThe slope of the given line is 2, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/2. So the equation of the perpendicular line passing through (6,0) is y -0 = -1/2(x -6), which simplifies to y = -1/2 x +3. \n\nNow find the intersection of y =2x -2 and y = -1/2 x +3. Set 2x -2 = -1/2 x +3. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction: 4x -4 = -x +6 → 4x +x = 6 +4 → 5x =10 → x=2. Then y =2*2 -2 =2. So intersection point is (2,2), which is the same as before. Distance from (6,0) to (2,2) is sqrt(16 +4) = sqrt(20)=2√5. \n\nSame answer. So all methods lead to 2√5. Therefore, the shortest distance is 2√5. \n\nSo I think that's the correct answer. The key was remembering the formula or using calculus or projection. All methods confirm the same result. So the answer should be 2√5, which in boxed form is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the point \\((6, 0)\\) to the line \\(y = 2x - 2\\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to a line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we rewrite the line equation \\(y = 2x - 2\\) in standard form \\(2x - y - 2 = 0\\).

For a polynomial \\(x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = 0\\), the sums of the roots are given by:\n- \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 = -a_3\\)\n- \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = a_2\\)\n- \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = -a_1\\)\n- \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = a_0\\)\n\nFor the given polynomial \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\\), we have \\(a_3 = 2\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 0\\), and \\(a_0 = 2\\).

However, we need more information to find the individual values of \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(S_3\\).\n\nTo proceed, we consider the polynomial \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\\). Let's attempt to factorize it or find its roots. The polynomial can be written as:\n\\[\nx^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nAttempting to factor it, we can try grouping or other methods. However, since the polynomial is quartic and the coefficients are not easily factorizable, we might consider substitution or trigonometric methods.\n\nLet's try substituting \\(x = y - \\frac{a_3}{4} = y - \\frac{2}{4} = y - 0.5\\). However, this might complicate things further. Alternatively, we can use the substitution \\(x = z - \\frac{1}{2}\\) to eliminate the cubic term, but this might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that complex roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4\\) must be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. Given that the polynomial is of degree 4 and the constant term is positive, it might have two real roots and two complex conjugate roots or four complex roots.\n\nHowever, let's check if the polynomial can be factored. Suppose it factors into two quadratics:\n\\[\n(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd\n\\]\nComparing coefficients with \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\\), we have:\n1. \\(a + c = 2\\)\n2. \\(ac + b + d = 0\\)\n3. \\(ad + bc = 0\\)\n4. \\(bd = 2\\)\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations. Let's start with \\(bd = 2\\). Possible integer pairs \\((b, d)\\) are \\((1, 2)\\), \\((2, 1)\\), \\((-1, -2)\\), \\((-2, -1)\\). Let's try \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 2\\). Then from \\(ad + bc = 0\\):\n\\[\na(2) + c(1) = 0 \\implies 2a + c = 0\n\\]\nBut \\(a + c = 2\\), so substituting \\(c = -2a\\) into \\(a + c = 2\\) gives:\n\\[\na - 2a = 2 \\implies -a = 2 \\implies a = -2\n\\]\nThen \\(c = -2a = 4\\). Now check \\(ac + b + d = (-2)(4) + 1 + 2 = -8 + 3 = -5 \\neq 0\\). Not valid.\n\nNext, try \\(b = -1\\) and \\(d = -2\\). Then \\(bd = (-1)(-2) = 2\\). From \\(ad + bc = 0\\):\n\\[\na(-2) + c(-1) = 0 \\implies -2a - c = 0 \\implies c = -2a\n\\]\nFrom \\(a + c = 2\\):\n\\[\na - 2a = 2 \\implies -a = 2 \\implies a = -2\n\\]\nThen \\(c = -2a = 4\\). Check \\(ac + b + d = (-2)(4) + (-1) + (-2) = -8 - 3 = -11 \\neq 0\\). Not valid.\n\nTrying \\(b = 2\\) and \\(d = 1\\). Then \\(ad + bc = 0\\):\n\\[\na(1) + c(2) = 0 \\implies a + 2c = 0\n\\]\nWith \\(a + c = 2\\), substitute \\(a = -2c\\) into \\(a + c = 2\\):\n\\[\n-2c + c = 2 \\implies -c = 2 \\implies c = -2 \\implies a = 4\n\\]\nCheck \\(ac + b + d = (4)(-2) + 2 + 1 = -8 + 3 = -5 \\neq 0\\). Not valid.\n\nNext, \\(b = -2\\) and \\(d = -1\\). Then \\(ad + bc = 0\\):\n\\[\na(-1) + c(-2) = 0 \\implies -a - 2c = 0 \\implies a = -2c\n\\]\nFrom \\(a + c = 2\\):\n\\[\n-2c + c = 2 \\implies -c = 2 \\implies c = -2 \\implies a = 4\n\\]\nCheck \\(ac + b + d = (4)(-2) + (-2) + (-1) = -8 - 3 = -11 \\neq 0\\). Not valid.\n\nThus, the polynomial does not factor into quadratics with integer coefficients. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nGiven that the polynomial is \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\\), we can attempt to use trigonometric substitution or consider it as a quadratic in \\(x^2\\). Let's substitute \\(y = x^2\\), but the polynomial is \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\\), which is not a function of \\(x^2\\) alone. Alternatively, we can write it as:\n\\[\nx^4 + 2x^3 = -2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^3(x + 2) = -2\n\\]\nNot sure if this helps. Alternatively, we can use the substitution \\(x = \\frac{1}{t}\\) to see if it helps, but this might not be useful.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the polynomial \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\\) and attempt to express it in terms of a quadratic in \\(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\) or some other substitution. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the polynomial is palindromic or reciprocal. Let's check:\nA reciprocal polynomial satisfies \\(x^4 P(1/x) = P(x)\\). Let's compute:\n\\[\nx^4 P(1/x) = x^4 \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^4 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3 + 2 \\right) = x^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{x^4} + \\frac{2}{x^3} + 2 \\right) = 1 + 2x + 2x^4 \\neq P(x)\n\\]\nThus, not reciprocal.\n\nAlternatively, using the substitution \\(t = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\), but this might not lead to simplification.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the substitution \\(x = z - \\frac{1}{2}\\) to eliminate the cubic term, but this is similar to the earlier approach which might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the roots come in pairs and use Vieta's formulas for the sums of products.\n\nGiven that the sum of all pairwise products is zero:\n\\[\nS_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe need more equations. Perhaps we can find the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time, which is given by Vieta's formula as zero:\n\\[\n\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's denote this sum as \\(T = 0\\). However, I'm not sure how to connect this to our desired expressions \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\), \\(S_3\\).\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product of all four roots is 2:\n\\[\n\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 2\n\\]\n\nIf we denote \\(P = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 2\\), then perhaps we can express the individual roots in terms of each other. However, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the symmetric sums and use Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums. However, given that we have the elementary symmetric sums from Vieta's formulas, Newton's identities might help in finding the power sums.\n\nNewton's identities relate the sums of powers of roots to the elementary symmetric sums. For a quartic polynomial, the power sums \\(P_k = \\alpha_1^k + \\alpha_2^k + \\alpha_3^k + \\alpha_4^k\\) can be computed using the recurrence:\n\\[\nP_k = -a_3 P_{k-1} - a_2 P_{k-2} - a_1 P_{k-3} - a_0 P_{k-4}\n\\]\nFor our polynomial, \\(a_3 = 2\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 0\\), \\(a_0 = 2\\). Thus, the recurrence becomes:\n\\[\nP_k = -2 P_{k-1} - 0 P_{k-2} - 0 P_{k-3} - 2 P_{k-4}\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nP_k = -2 P_{k-1} - 2 P_{k-4}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute the first few power sums:\n- For \\(k = 1\\): \\(P_1 = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 = -2\\) (from Vieta)\n- For \\(k = 2\\): \\(P_2 = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4)^2 - 2(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4) = (-2)^2 - 2(0) = 4\\)\n- For \\(k = 3\\): Using the recurrence \\(P_3 = -2 P_2 - 2 P_{-1}\\).

And there are no other prices mentioned, so I guess the gum is the same price each time. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me translate the currency to cents to make it easier. Since $1 is 100 cents, $1.24 would be 124 cents, and $1.82 would be 182 cents.

Then, according to the problem:\n\n3T + G = 124  ...(1)\n5T + G = 182  ...(2)\n\nHmm, okay. So we have two equations here with two variables. Since both equations have G and T, maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate G. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(5T + G) - (3T + G) = 182 - 124\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\n5T + G - 3T - G = 2T\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n182 - 124 = 58\n\nSo, 2T = 58\n\nTherefore, T = 58 / 2 = 29\n\nWait, so that means each toothpick is 29 cents? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf T is 29, then let's plug back into equation (1):\n\n3*29 + G = 124\n\n87 + G = 124\n\nSo, G = 124 - 87 = 37\n\nThen check equation (2):\n\n5*29 + G = 145 + 37 = 182\n\nYes, that works out. 145 + 37 is indeed 182. So the calculations check out.\n\nTherefore, the cost of one toothpick is 29 cents. Let me just make sure there's no trick or anything I missed. The problem mentions that there are no other prices that could affect the result, so the two equations given are sufficient. And by solving the system of equations, we arrived at T = 29 cents. Seems solid.\n\nAnother way to approach it could be to subtract the total amounts directly. If you have five toothpicks and a gum versus three toothpicks and a gum, the difference is two toothpicks and $0.58 ($1.82 - $1.24). So two toothpicks cost $0.58, which is 58 cents. Therefore, each toothpick is 29 cents. Yep, same result. So that's another way to confirm it.\n\nI think that's thorough. The answer should be 29 cents.\n</think>\n\nTužka a velká guma stojí 124 centov. Pět tužek a velká gaja stojí 182 centov. Žádné ceny nez自分ují daň.

The rectangle has sides AB and AD with the ratio AB/AD = k. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that in geometry, the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So, if I want to find the region where a point is closer to O than to, say, vertex A, the boundary would be the perpendicular bisector of segment OA. Similarly, for each vertex, there will be a perpendicular bisector. The region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex should be the intersection of all regions closer to O than each vertex. That region is likely a convex polygon or some symmetrical shape inside the rectangle.\n\nSince the rectangle is centered at O, maybe the problem has some symmetry that I can exploit. Let me try to visualize this. For each side of the rectangle, there might be a region near the center where points are closer to O than to the adjacent vertices. Maybe I need to construct these regions and find their area relative to the entire rectangle.\n\nLet me start by setting up a coordinate system. Let’s place the rectangle ABCD such that its center O is at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume that the rectangle has length AB = 2a (so that the coordinates of B are (a, b)) and AD = 2b, so that the coordinates of D are ( -a, -b ). Wait, but the ratio AB/AD = k, so AB = k * AD. Therefore, if AD = 2b, then AB = 2b * k. So the rectangle has sides 2b*k and 2b. But then, the coordinates might need to be adjusted accordingly. Maybe it's better to let AB = 2k and AD = 2, so that the ratio AB/AD = k. Then, the rectangle extends from (-k, -1) to (k, 1). But maybe even better to set AD = 2a, AB = 2a*k, so that the ratio is k, and the center is at (0,0). So coordinates would be:\n\nA: (-a*k, a)\n\nB: (a*k, a)\n\nC: (a*k, -a)\n\nD: (-a*k, -a)\n\nBut maybe even better to set a = 1 for simplicity, since the probability should be independent of the scale. So set AB = 2k and AD = 2, so the rectangle is from (-k, -1) to (k, 1). Then the center O is at (0,0). The vertices are at (-k,1), (k,1), (k,-1), (-k,-1).\n\nNow, to find the region where a point (x,y) is closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nThe condition for a point (x,y) to be closer to O than to A is sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x + k)² + (y - 1)² )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx² + y² < (x + k)² + (y - 1)²\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\nx² + 2kx + k² + y² - 2y + 1\n\nSubtract left-hand side:\n\n0 < 2kx + k² - 2y + 1\n\nSo the inequality simplifies to:\n\n2kx - 2y + (k² + 1) > 0\n\nSimilarly, for each vertex, we can derive a similar inequality. Let me do that for all four vertices.\n\nFirst, vertex A: (-k,1)\n\nCondition: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x + k)² + (y - 1)² )\n\nAs above, simplifies to 2kx - 2y + (k² +1) > 0\n\nSimilarly, vertex B: (k,1)\n\nCondition: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x - k)² + (y - 1)² )\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x - k)² + (y -1)^2\n\nExpand right-hand side: x² - 2kx + k² + y² - 2y +1\n\nSubtract left-hand side:\n\n0 < -2kx + k² -2y +1\n\nSo inequality: -2kx -2y + (k² +1) > 0\n\nSimilarly, vertex C: (k,-1)\n\nCondition: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x - k)^2 + (y +1)^2 )\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x -k)^2 + (y +1)^2\n\nExpand right-hand side: x² -2kx +k² + y² +2y +1\n\nSubtract left-hand side:\n\n0 < -2kx +k² +2y +1\n\nInequality: -2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0\n\nVertex D: (-k,-1)\n\nCondition: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x +k)^2 + (y +1)^2 )\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x +k)^2 + (y +1)^2\n\nExpand right-hand side: x² +2kx +k² + y² +2y +1\n\nSubtract left-hand side:\n\n0 < 2kx +k² +2y +1\n\nInequality: 2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0\n\nSo, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions defined by the inequalities:\n\n1. 2kx -2y + (k² +1) >0\n\n2. -2kx -2y + (k² +1) >0\n\n3. -2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0\n\n4. 2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0\n\nThese four inequalities define a polygon around the center O. To find the area of this polygon, I need to find the intersection points of these lines.\n\nLet me first note that these inequalities are linear, so their intersection will form a convex polygon. Let me try to find the equations of these lines.\n\n1. 2kx -2y + (k² +1) =0 → y = kx + (k² +1)/2\n\n2. -2kx -2y + (k² +1) =0 → y = -kx + (k² +1)/2\n\n3. -2kx +2y + (k² +1) =0 → y = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\n4. 2kx +2y + (k² +1) =0 → y = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor inequality 1: 2kx -2y + (k² +1) >0 → rearranged to y < kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nSimilarly, inequality 2: -2kx -2y + (k² +1) >0 → y < -kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nInequality 3: -2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0 → y > kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nInequality 4: 2kx +2y + (k² +1) >0 → y > -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nSo the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by the four lines:\n\ny = kx + (k² +1)/2 (upper boundary from the left side)\n\ny = -kx + (k² +1)/2 (upper boundary from the right side)\n\ny = kx - (k² +1)/2 (lower boundary from the left side)\n\ny = -kx - (k² +1)/2 (lower boundary from the right side)\n\nThese four lines form a diamond-shaped (rhombus) region around the center O. The intersection of these inequalities will be the area between these four lines.\n\nTo find the vertices of this region, we need to find the intersection points of these lines.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of lines 1 and 2:\n\nLine 1: y = kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nLine 2: y = -kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\nkx + (k² +1)/2 = -kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nSo, 2kx =0 → x=0\n\nSubstitute back into line 1: y=0 + (k² +1)/2 = (k² +1)/2\n\nSo intersection point is (0, (k² +1)/2 )\n\nBut wait, this point is above the center O. Similarly, intersection of lines 3 and 4:\n\nLine 3: y = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nLine 4: y = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\nkx - (k² +1)/2 = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nSo, 2kx =0 → x=0\n\nSubstitute into line 3: y=0 - (k² +1)/2 = -(k² +1)/2\n\nIntersection point (0, -(k² +1)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, intersections of lines 1 and 3:\n\nLine 1: y = kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nLine 3: y = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\nkx + (k² +1)/2 = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nWhich implies (k² +1)/2 = - (k² +1)/2 → (k² +1)/2 + (k² +1)/2 =0 → k² +1=0, which is impossible. So lines 1 and 3 are parallel?\n\nWait, no. Wait, line 1 has slope k, line 3 also has slope k. So they are parallel. Similarly, line 2 and line 4 have slope -k, so they are parallel. Therefore, the region defined by these four lines is a parallelogram, but since lines 1 and 3 are parallel, and lines 2 and 4 are parallel, it's a parallelogram. But since the slopes are k and -k, the angles between the lines are 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, if two lines have slopes k and -k, their product is -k², which is not necessarily -1 unless k=1. So they are not necessarily perpendicular unless k=1. So the angles between the lines depend on k.\n\nWait, but in our case, since the original rectangle has sides with ratio k, maybe the angles here also relate to k. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, the region is a parallelogram with sides defined by these four lines. But since lines 1 and 3 are parallel, and lines 2 and 4 are parallel, the figure is a parallelogram. The vertices of the parallelogram are the intersections of lines 1 & 2, lines 2 & 4, lines 4 & 3, and lines 3 & 1. Wait, but lines 1 & 3 don't intersect. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I need to check all intersections. Wait, lines 1 and 3 are parallel, so they don't intersect. Similarly, lines 2 and 4 are parallel. So the four lines form two pairs of parallel lines, which intersect each other. Wait, no, lines 1 and 2 intersect at (0, (k² +1)/2 ), lines 2 and 3? Wait, lines 2 and 3: line 2 is y = -kx + (k² +1)/2 and line 3 is y = kx - (k² +1)/2. Let's intersect them.\n\nSet -kx + (k² +1)/2 = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nBring terms together:\n\n- kx -kx = - (k² +1)/2 - (k² +1)/2\n\n-2kx = - (k² +1)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2kx = k² +1\n\nx = (k² +1)/(2k)\n\nThen substitute back into line 2: y = -k*( (k² +1)/(2k) ) + (k² +1)/2 = - (k² +1)/2 + (k² +1)/2 =0\n\nSo intersection point is ( (k² +1)/(2k), 0 )\n\nSimilarly, intersection of lines 3 and 4:\n\nLine 3: y = kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nLine 4: y = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\nkx - (k² +1)/2 = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\n2kx =0 → x=0\n\nThen y =0 - (k² +1)/2 = - (k² +1)/2\n\nSo intersection point (0, - (k² +1)/2 )\n\nIntersection of lines 4 and 1:\n\nLine 4: y = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nLine 1: y =kx + (k² +1)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\n- kx - (k² +1)/2 = kx + (k² +1)/2\n\n-2kx = (k² +1)/2 + (k² +1)/2 = k² +1\n\nx = - (k² +1)/(2k)\n\nThen y = -k*(- (k² +1)/(2k)) - (k² +1)/2 = (k² +1)/2 - (k² +1)/2 =0\n\nSo intersection point ( - (k² +1)/(2k), 0 )\n\nSimilarly, intersection of lines 1 and 4? Wait, no, lines 1 and 4 are not parallel. Wait, line 1 is y =kx + (k² +1)/2 and line 4 is y = -kx - (k² +1)/2. Let's intersect them:\n\nkx + (k² +1)/2 = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\n2kx = - (k² +1) - (k² +1)/2\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, kx + (k² +1)/2 = -kx - (k² +1)/2\n\nBring terms to left:\n\nkx + kx + (k² +1)/2 + (k² +1)/2 =0", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}

Dividing 54 by 6... Well, 6 times 9 is 54, right? Because 6*9=54. So if I divide 54 by 6, the quotient is 9 and there's no remainder. So the remainder should be 0. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I divide 54 by 6, how many times does 6 go into 54? Starting from 6, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54. That's 9 times.

So, we have this function f(n) defined piecewise. For n greater than or equal to 4, f(n) is the floor of n, which means the greatest integer less than or equal to n. For n less than 4, it's the ceiling of n, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n. We need to compute f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)) and sum those up.\n\nFirst, let's break down each term individually. Let me start with the first one: f(π/3). I know π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 would be around 1.0472 radians. But wait, here n is just a number, not necessarily an angle. So π/3 as a numerical value is approximately 1.0472. Since this is less than 4, we use the ceiling function for this term. The ceiling of π/3 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1.0472. The integers around that are 1 and 2. Since 1.0472 is more than 1, the ceiling is 2. So f(π/3) = 2. Let me confirm that: π is about 3.1416, so π/3 ≈ 1.0472, yes, less than 4, so ceiling to 2. That seems right.\n\nNext, f(√45). Let's compute √45. Since 45 is between 36 (6²) and 49 (7²), √45 is between 6 and 7. Specifically, 6.7082 approximately, because 6.7² = 44.89, which is close to 45. So √45 ≈ 6.7082. Since 6.7082 is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function here. The floor of 6.7082 is 6, because 6 is the greatest integer less than 6.7082. So f(√45) = 6. Let me check that again: √45 is approximately 6.708, which is indeed less than 7, so floor is 6. Correct.\n\nThird term: f(8^(2/3)). Let's compute 8^(2/3). The exponent 2/3 can be broken down as first taking the cube root of 8 and then squaring it. The cube root of 8 is 2, since 2³=8. Then squaring 2 gives 4. So 8^(2/3) = 4. Now, since 4 is equal to 4, we use the floor function here. Wait, but the floor of 4 is just 4. So f(8^(2/3)) = 4. Let me verify: 8^(2/3) is indeed 4. So yes, since 4 is an integer, floor(4) is 4. Correct.\n\nNow, adding up the three results: 2 (from π/3) + 6 (from √45) + 4 (from 8^(2/3)) equals 2 + 6 + 4. Let's do the arithmetic: 2 + 6 is 8, then 8 + 4 is 12. So the total sum is 12.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't mix up any terms or apply the functions incorrectly. Let's go through each one again.\n\nFirst term: π/3 ≈ 1.047 < 4, so ceiling is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708 >=4, so floor is 6. Correct.\n\nThird term: 8^(2/3) = (8^(1/3))^2 = 2² = 4. Since 4 >=4, floor is 4. Correct.\n\nSum: 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. Yes, that seems right. Hmm, I don't think I made any mistakes here. All steps check out. So the final answer should be 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \\( f(n) \\) for three different values: \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\sqrt{45} \\), and \\( 8^{2/3} \\), and then sum the results.

Kolik peněz, v centech, zůstalo poté, co vyměnily co nejvíce mincí za bankovky?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie all sold lemonade and made some money. Their amounts are given in dollars and cents. Then they combined all their money and went to the bank to exchange cents into dollars. The question is asking how many cents would be left after they exchange as many cents as possible into dollars. So, basically, when you have a certain amount of cents, you can divide by 100 to get dollars, right? The remainder would be the leftover cents. But since they are combining all their money first, we need to sum up all the cents they have and then find out how many cents are left after converting the total amount into dollars.\n\nWait, but first, let me check the problem again. It says they \"daly své peníze dohromady a šly do banky, aby vyměnily mince za dolary.\" Translating that, it means they put all their money together and exchanged cents for dollars. So, the total amount they have is the sum of all their individual amounts. Then, when they go to the bank, they exchange cents for dollars. Each dollar is 100 cents, so they can exchange 100 cents for 1 dollar. So, the question is, after exchanging as many cents as possible into dollars, how many cents are left? That would be the remainder when the total cents are divided by 100.\n\nBut first, we need to calculate the total amount of money they have in cents. Let me convert each person's amount to cents. So, Linda has $27.47. To convert dollars to cents, you multiply by 100. But since $27 is 2700 cents, and 47 cents is already in cents, so total is 2747 cents. Similarly for the others:\n\nSherry: $35.23 = 3523 cents\n\nJune: $37.37 = 3737 cents\n\nConnie: $26.52 = 2652 cents\n\nNow, sum all these up. Let me add them step by step.\n\nFirst, Linda and Sherry: 2747 + 3523.\n\n2747 + 3523. Let's see:\n\n2747 + 3523. Break it down:\n\n2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\n700 + 500 = 1200\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo total is 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 +10=6270. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2747 + 3523.\n\nAlternatively, add 2747 + 3523:\n\n2747 + 3523. Let's add the thousands: 2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\nThen hundreds: 700 + 500 = 1200\n\nTens: 40 + 20 = 60\n\nOnes: 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo total is 5000 + 1200 = 6200; 6200 + 60 = 6260; 6260 +10=6270. So 6270 cents.\n\nThen add June's 3737 cents: 6270 + 3737.\n\n6270 + 3737. Let's break it down:\n\n6000 + 3000 = 9000\n\n200 + 700 = 900\n\n70 + 30 = 100\n\n7 + 7 = 14\n\nWait, but actually, 6270 + 3737:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 37 = 10007. Wait, that seems off. Wait, maybe another way.\n\n6270 + 3737:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 30 = 10000\n\n10000 + 7 = 10007. Yes, so 10,007 cents.\n\nThen add Connie's 2652 cents: 10007 + 2652.\n\n10007 + 2000 = 12007\n\n12007 + 600 = 12607\n\n12607 + 50 = 12657\n\n12657 + 2 = 12659. So total is 12,659 cents.\n\nNow, when they go to the bank, they can exchange cents into dollars. Each dollar is 100 cents, so they can divide the total cents by 100 to find out how many dollars they can get, and the remainder will be the leftover cents. So, 12,659 divided by 100.\n\n12,659 ÷ 100. 100 x 126 = 12,600. So, 126 dollars, and 59 cents left over. Because 126 x 100 = 12,600, subtract that from 12,659: 12,659 - 12,600 = 59. So, 59 cents left.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 59 cents.\n\nWait, let me verify the addition again to be sure. Sometimes when adding multiple numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLinda: 2747\n\nSherry: 3523\n\nJune: 3737\n\nConnie: 2652\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nFirst, Linda + Sherry: 2747 + 3523. Let's do it vertically:\n\n  2747\n\n+3523\n\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n7 + 3 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n7 + 5 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 3 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nSo total is 6270. Correct.\n\nThen add June: 6270 + 3737.\n\n6270\n\n+3737\n\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 + 7 =7\n\n7 + 3 =10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\n2 +7=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\n6 +3=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\n0 +3=0 +1=1.\n\nSo total is 10007. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, 6270 + 3737.\n\nWait, 6000 + 3000 = 9000\n\n200 + 700 = 900\n\n70 + 30 = 100\n\n7 + 7 =14\n\nWait, but that's 9000 + 900 = 9900 + 100 = 10,000 +14=10,014? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps vertical addition is easier.\n\n6270\n\n+3737\n\n= (6000 + 3000) + (200 + 700) + (70 + 30) + (7 +7)\n\n=9000 + 900 + 100 +14=9000+900=9900+100=10,000+14=10,014? Wait, but that contradicts the previous result. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the vertical addition.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n  6270\n\n+ 3737\n\n------\n\nAdding units place: 0 +7 =7\n\nTens place:7 +3=10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\nHundreds place:2 +7=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\nThousands place:6 +3=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1.\n\nTen-thousands place: 0 +0 +1=1.\n\nSo total is 10,007. Wait, so that's 10,007. But earlier, when I added 6270 + 3737 using another method, I got 10,007. Wait, but when I added 6270 + 3737 as 6270 + 3000 =9270, then 9270 +700=9970, then 9970 +37=10,007. Yes, that's correct. So 6270 +3737=10,007. Then add Connie's 2652:\n\n10,007 +2,652.\n\nAdding 10,007 +2,000=12,007\n\n12,007 +600=12,607\n\n12,607 +50=12,657\n\n12,657 +2=12,659. So total is 12,659 cents. Correct.\n\nSo total cents:12,659. Divided by 100 is 126.59. So 126 dollars and 59 cents. So the leftover is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe I miscalculated the total. Let me add all the amounts again in dollars and cents first, then convert to cents.\n\nLinda: $27.47 = 27 + 0.47 = 27.47 dollars\n\nSherry: $35.23 = 35.23\n\nJune: $37.37 =37.37\n\nConnie: $26.52 =26.52\n\nAdding dollars:27 +35 +37 +26.\n\n27 +35=62; 62 +37=99; 99 +26=125 dollars.\n\nAdding cents:0.47 +0.23 +0.37 +0.52.\n\n0.47 +0.23=0.70\n\n0.70 +0.37=1.07\n\n1.07 +0.52=1.59 dollars.\n\nSo total amount is 125 +1.59=126.59 dollars.\n\nConvert that to cents:126.59 dollars *100=12,659 cents.\n\nYes, same result. So 12,659 cents. Divided by 100 is 126 dollars and 59 cents. So leftover is 59 cents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 59. So the answer is 59.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount of money left is \\boxed{59} cents.\n</think>\n\nLinda, Sherry, June, and Connie each made the following amounts of money from selling lemonade:\n\n- Linda: $27.47\n- Sherry: $35.23\n- June: $37.37\n- Connie: $26.52\n\nFirst, we convert each amount to cents:\n- Linda: \\(27.47 \\times 100 = 2747\\) cents\n- Sherry: \\(35.23 \\times 100 = 3523\\) cents\n- June: \\(37.37 \\times 100 = 3737\\) cents\n- Connie: \\(26.52 \\times 100 = 2652\\) cents\n\nNext, we sum these amounts:\n\\[\n2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652\n\\]\n\nAdding step-by-step:\n1. Linda and Sherry: \\(2747 + 3523 = 6270\\) cents\n2. Adding June's contribution: \\(6270 + 3737 = 10007\\) cents\n3. Adding Connie's contribution: \\(10007 + 2652 = 12659\\) cents\n\nThe total amount in cents is 12659.

The problem says that 20 students got 80 points, 8 students got 90 points, and 2 students got 100 points. We need to find the arithmetic mean of the class. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the arithmetic mean is calculated by taking the sum of all the values and dividing it by the number of values. In this case, the values are the points each student got, and the number of values is the number of students, which is 30. So, the formula should be:\n\nMean = (Sum of all scores) / (Number of students)\n\nSo, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores first. Let's do that. There are three groups of students with different scores:\n\n1. 20 students with 80 points each.\n2. 8 students with 90 points each.\n3. 2 students with 100 points each.\n\nTo find the total sum, we can multiply the number of students in each group by their respective scores and then add all those products together. Let me write that out:\n\nTotal sum = (20 * 80) + (8 * 90) + (2 * 100)\n\nLet me compute each part separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 20 * 80. Hmm, 20 times 80. Well, 20 times 100 is 2000, so 20 times 80 should be 1600. Let me check: 80 * 20. 80*10 is 800, so 800*2 is 1600. Yep, that's right.\n\nSecond part: 8 * 90. 8 times 90. 90 times 8 is like 9 times 8 times 10. 9 times 8 is 72, so 72 times 10 is 720. So that's 720. Let me confirm: 8*90. 10*8 is 80, so 80*9 is 720. Correct.\n\nThird part: 2 * 100. That's straightforward. 2 times 100 is 200. So that's 200.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 1600 + 720 + 200. Let's do that step by step. 1600 + 720. 1600 + 700 is 2300, and then +20 is 2320. Then 2320 + 200 is 2520. So the total sum of all the scores is 2520.\n\nNow, we need to divide this total by the number of students, which is 30. So, the mean is 2520 divided by 30. Let's compute that.\n\n2520 divided by 30. Hmm, 30 times 80 is 2400. So 2520 minus 2400 is 120. Then 30 goes into 120 four times. So 80 + 4 = 84. Therefore, 2520 divided by 30 is 84. Let me check with another method. 30 times 84: 30*80=2400, 30*4=120, so 2400+120=2520. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of the class is 84. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We added up all the scores: 20*80, 8*90, 2*100, got 2520. Divided by 30 students, got 84. Seems right. I think that's it!\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe arithmetic mean of the class is \\boxed{84}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the arithmetic mean of the class, we first calculate the total sum of all the scores. The class consists of three groups of students with different scores:\n\n1. 20 students scoring 80 points each: \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 80 = 1600\n   \\]\n2. 8 students scoring 90 points each: \n   \\[\n   8 \\times 90 = 720\n   \\]\n3. 2 students scoring 100 points each: \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 100 = 200\n   \\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total sum of all scores:\n\\[\n1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide the total sum by the number of students (30) to find the arithmetic mean:\n\\[\n\\frac{2520}{30} = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the arithmetic mean of the class is \\boxed{84}.", "answer": "84"}

Let me start by recalling what a magic square is. It's a grid where the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are all equal. The Asymptote code provided gives me the labels for each cell in the 3x3 grid. Let me try to visualize it based on the labels:\n\nTop row: n-3, 3, n+1\nMiddle row: n+2, 2n-9, 1\nBottom row: 2, n, n-1\n\nSo, the magic square looks like this:\n\n| n-3 | 3  | n+1 |\n|-----|----|-----|\n| n+2| 2n-9 | 1  |\n| 2  | n  | n-1 |\n\nAlright, now I need to set up equations based on the magic square properties. Let's denote the common sum as S. Then, each row, column, and the two diagonals should add up to S.\n\nLet me start by writing the equations for the rows.\n\nFirst row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S\nSimplify that: n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S\n\nSecond row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S\nSimplify: n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S\n\nThird row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S\nSimplify: 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 = S\n\nHmm, interesting. So the first and third rows both give S = 2n + 1, and the second row gives S = 3n - 6. Since all rows must have the same sum, these two expressions for S must be equal. So:\n\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\nSolving for n:\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides: 1 = n - 6\n\nAdd 6 to both sides: n = 7\n\nWait, let me check if this works. Let me verify if n = 7 makes all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.\n\nFirst, let's compute S using the first row: 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15. So S should be 15.\n\nLet me check the first row with n=7: n-3 = 7-3=4, 3, n+1=7+1=8. So 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Correct.\n\nSecond row: n+2 = 9, 2n-9=14-9=5, 1. So 9 + 5 + 1 = 15. Correct.\n\nThird row: 2, n=7, n-1=6. 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. Correct. So rows are okay.\n\nNow let's check the columns.\n\nFirst column: n-3, n+2, 2. With n=7: 4, 9, 2. Sum: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Good.\n\nSecond column: 3, 2n-9, n. With n=7: 3, 5, 7. Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Good.\n\nThird column: n+1, 1, n-1. With n=7: 8, 1, 6. Sum: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15. Good.\n\nNow diagonals.\n\nMain diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): n-3, 2n-9, n-1. With n=7: 4, 5, 6. Sum: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. Good.\n\nOther diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): n+1, 2n-9, 2. With n=7: 8, 5, 2. Sum: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15. Correct.\n\nSo all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when n=7. Therefore, the value of n is 7.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my equations, let me cross-verify.\n\nEarlier, I set up the first row as 2n + 1 = S, second as 3n - 6 = S, third as 2n + 1 = S. Then equated first and third to get n=7, which also satisfies the second equation. Let me plug n=7 into 3n -6: 21 -6 =15, which matches S=15. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, n=7 is the correct answer. I think that's solid. All checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( n \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\( n \\) in the given magic square, we start by noting that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal must be equal.

Alright, let's start by recalling some properties of complex numbers and roots of unity. \n\nFirst, ω is a cube root of unity. That means it satisfies the equation ω³ = 1. The cube roots of 1 are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. These roots have some interesting properties. For example, they satisfy the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That might come in handy later. Also, since ω³ = 1, any higher power of ω can be simplified by taking the exponent modulo 3. For instance, ω⁴ = ω^(3+1) = ω¹ = ω. But in this problem, we have ω and ω², so maybe we can use the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0 to simplify expressions.\n\nThe expression we need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me write that down:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nHmm, maybe I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction to simplify. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So:\n\nE = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n(1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nSo E = (2 + ω + ω²) / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nNow, notice that in the denominator, we have (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand that:\n\n(1)(1) + 1(ω²) + ω(1) + ω(ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so this becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nWait a second! So the denominator is also 2 + ω + ω². Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\nE = (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²) = 1\n\nSo does that mean the expression is always equal to 1 regardless of which cube root of unity ω we choose? But hold on, ω can be either of the non-real cube roots. Let me check with specific values.\n\nLet me recall that the cube roots of 1 are 1, and the two complex ones: ω = (-1 + i√3)/2 and ω² = (-1 - i√3)/2. Let's compute E for ω = 1 first, even though I thought ω ≠ 1. Wait, but the problem says \"nechxDD that ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1.\" So maybe they consider ω ≠ 1? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, but if ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even if ω = 1, the expression is 1. So regardless of ω being 1 or the complex roots, the expression is 1. So maybe the answer is just 1?\n\nWait, but let me verify with the complex roots. Let's take ω = (-1 + i√3)/2. Then compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 - 1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω²: 1 + (-1 - i√3)/2 = (2 -1 - i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSo 1/(1 + ω) = 2/(1 + i√3), and 1/(1 + ω²) = 2/(1 - i√3).\n\nLet's compute these:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate for each term.\n\nFor 2/(1 + i√3), multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3) / [ (1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 2*(1 - i√3) / (1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for 2/(1 - i√3), multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3) / [1 + (√3)^2] = 2*(1 + i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nAdding these two results: (1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo even when ω is a complex cube root of unity, the expression equals 1. If ω = 1, as we saw earlier, it also equals 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression is always 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"najděte všechny možné hodnoty\" which translates to \"Find all possible values...\". So if regardless of ω, the expression is always 1, then the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1. But let me check again in case I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that since ω³ = 1, then ω² = 1/ω and ω = 1/ω². Maybe using that to rewrite the expression.\n\nWait, but ω² is not equal to 1/ω unless ω³ = 1. Since ω³ = 1, then 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω. So indeed, ω² = 1/ω. So substituting that into the expression:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + 1/ω)\n\nLet's compute the second term: 1/(1 + 1/ω) = ω/(ω + 1). Therefore, E becomes:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + ω/(1 + ω) = (1 + ω)/(1 + ω) = 1.\n\nAgain, we get 1. So regardless of ω, as long as ω³ = 1, the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let me denote S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's compute S:\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)] = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ] as before.\n\nBut since ω² + ω + 1 = 0, then the numerator is 2 + ω + ω² = 1 + (1 + ω + ω²) = 1 + 0 = 1. Wait, no: 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1, since ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, numerator is 1. Denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so denominator is 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1. Therefore, S = 1/1 = 1. So yes, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, no matter what ω is, as long as it's a cube root of unity (including ω = 1), the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with ω = 1. Then S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Yep. If ω is ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, we already saw it gives 1. Same with ω². So all possible values are just 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity, satisfying the equation \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\). The cube roots of 1 are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\). These roots satisfy the equation \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\).\n\nWe start by simplifying the given expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions over a common denominator, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\\[\n1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nUsing the property \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\), we know \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the denominator \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\):\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), this becomes:\n\\[\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nAgain, using \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), the denominator simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis result holds for all cube roots of unity, including \\(\\omega = 1\\), \\(\\omega = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), and \\(\\omega = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).

So, the question is asking for the shortest distance you can travel starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, visiting the other three points once each. The figure is provided with some distances labeled: DB is 3, AB is 6, AC is 6, DC is 4, AD is 5, and CB is 5. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the diagram. The Asymptote code draws triangle DBC with some labels, and also triangles ABD and ACD. From the labels, it seems like there are overlapping triangles with some shared edges. Let me try to sketch this mentally.\n\nPoint D is connected to B with a distance of 3. D is also connected to A with 5. Point A is connected to B with 6. So, triangle ABD has sides AB=6, BD=3, AD=5. Then, AC is 6, and DC is 4. So, triangle ADC has sides AC=6, DC=4, AD=5. Then CB is 5, so triangle BCD has sides BC=5, CD=4, BD=3. \n\nWait, BD is 3, CD is 4, and BC is 5. That makes triangle BCD a right triangle because 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triplet. So, if BD=3, DC=4, and BC=5, then angle at D is a right angle? Hmm, but BD is 3, DC is 4, and BC is 5. So, yes, 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². So triangle BCD is right-angled at D. That's helpful.\n\nSimilarly, triangle ABD has sides 5, 3, 6. Let me check if that's a valid triangle. The sum of the two smaller sides should be greater than the largest side. 3 + 5 = 8 > 6, so yes. But is it a right triangle? 3² + 5² = 9 + 25 = 34, which is not equal to 6²=36. So, not a right triangle. Similarly, triangle ADC has sides 5, 6, 4. 4² +5²=16+25=41≠6²=36, so not a right triangle.\n\nSo, the figure is a combination of triangles connected through point D. Let me try to map all the points:\n\n- Points A, B, C, D with the given distances.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the shortest possible route starting at any of the points A, B, C, D and visiting the other three points once each. So, essentially, we need to compute the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for these four points and find the minimal total distance.\n\nBut since the starting point can be any of the four, we need to check all possible starting points and find the minimal TSP tour for each, then choose the smallest among those.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible permutations of the four points, but since we start at a specific point and traverse to the other three, the total number of possible routes is 4 (starting points) multiplied by 3! (permutations of the other three) = 24. But since some routes might be symmetric or overlap, but given the distances are fixed, we need to compute the total distance for each possible route and find the minimum.\n\nHowever, since there are only four points, maybe we can compute the TSP for each starting point and then compare.\n\nAlternatively, since the TSP is about finding the shortest Hamiltonian circuit, but here, since we can start at any point, we can compute the minimal circuit over all starting points.\n\nBut perhaps we can exploit the given distances and see if there are any cycles or if some paths are longer than others.\n\nAlternatively, since the figure is given, maybe there are some paths that are shorter due to the geometric layout, even if the distances aren't immediately obvious from the labels. For example, if some paths cross each other, but since it's a 2D figure, the actual Euclidean distance might be shorter, but the problem says \"lze URAZIT\", which is Czech for \"can travel\". But in the problem statement, it specifies the distances between the points as per the labels, so we can't assume any other distances. The given distances are the ones we have to work with.\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, they draw D--B--C--cycle, D--A--B--cycle, and D--A--C--cycle. So, perhaps the figure is a combination of these triangles. Let me think.\n\nSo, points D, B, C form triangle DBC (right-angled at D). Points D, A, B form triangle ABD. Points D, A, C form triangle ADC. So, all three triangles share point D.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the figure is a three-dimensional structure, but since it's drawn in 2D with Asymptote, it's a planar figure. The Asymptote code draws D connected to B and C, A connected to B and C, but with some overlapping lines. However, the actual figure might be a tetrahedron embedded in 2D space, but since it's drawn in 2D, some edges might cross. But the problem states the distances between the points as per the labels.\n\nSo, perhaps we can treat the points as a graph with the given edge weights, and compute the shortest Hamiltonian path starting at each node.\n\nBut in the classic TSP, you have to return to the starting point, but here, the problem says \"navigate through the remaining three points once each\". So, it's a Hamiltonian path, not a cycle. So, the problem is to find the shortest path starting at any node and visiting the other three without repetition.\n\nTherefore, for each starting node, we need to compute the minimal path length that visits all other three nodes exactly once, and then take the minimal such length over all starting nodes.\n\nSo, let's list all possible starting points and compute the minimal path for each.\n\nFirst, let's list the distances between all pairs:\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- AB = 6\n\n- AC = 6\n\n- AD = 5\n\n- BC = 5\n\n- BD = 3\n\n- CD = 4\n\nSo, the complete graph has edges:\n\nA-B: 6\n\nA-C: 6\n\nA-D: 5\n\nB-C: 5\n\nB-D: 3\n\nC-D: 4\n\nSo, all pairwise distances are given except perhaps A-B, A-C, B-C, which are given. Wait, all are given.\n\nSo, the distances are:\n\nAB = 6\n\nAC = 6\n\nAD = 5\n\nBC = 5\n\nBD = 3\n\nCD = 4\n\nSo, the graph is fully connected with these distances.\n\nSo, we need to compute the shortest Hamiltonian path starting at each node and visiting the other three nodes.\n\nLet's start with starting at point A.\n\nStarting at A, we need to go to B, C, D, and back to A? Wait, no, because it's a path, not a cycle. So, starting at A, visiting B, C, D in some order, and then ending at the last point. Wait, no, the problem says \"navigate through the remaining three points once each\". So, starting at any point, and then moving to the other three points once each. So, the path will have four edges: starting point to first, first to second, second to third, third to fourth (the last point). So, three edges total.\n\nWait, no. If you start at a point and visit three others, you need three edges. For example, starting at A, then go to B, then to C, then to D. That's three edges: AB, BC, CD. But in that case, the total distance is 6 +5 +4=15. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nWait, but the starting point is included. Wait, perhaps the problem is starting at any point, then visiting the other three points in some order, and the total distance is the sum of the four edges? Wait, no. If you start at A, and visit B, C, D, then the total distance is AB + BC + CD, which is 6 +5 +4=15. But maybe starting at a different point allows for a shorter path.\n\nBut let's check all possibilities.\n\nFirst, starting at A:\n\nPossible paths:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D: AB + BC + CD = 6 +5 +4=15\n\nA -> B -> D -> C: AB + BD + DC =6 +3 +4=13\n\nA -> C -> B -> D: AC + CB + BD=6 +5 +3=14\n\nA -> C -> D -> B: AC + CD + DB=6 +4 +3=13\n\nA -> D -> B -> C: AD + DB + BC=5 +3 +5=13\n\nA -> D -> C -> B: AD + DC + CB=5 +4 +5=14\n\nSo, the minimal path starting at A is 13, via either A-B-D-C or A-C-D-B.\n\nNext, starting at B:\n\nPossible paths:\n\nB -> A -> C -> D: BA + AC + CD=6 +6 +4=16\n\nB -> A -> D -> C: BA + AD + DC=6 +5 +4=15\n\nB -> C -> A -> D: BC + CA + AD=5 +6 +5=16\n\nB -> C -> D -> A: BC + CD + DA=5 +4 +5=14\n\nB -> D -> A -> C: BD + DA + AC=3 +5 +6=14\n\nB -> D -> C -> A: BD + DC + CA=3 +4 +6=13\n\nSo, starting at B, the minimal path is 13, via B-D-C-A or B-D-A-C or B-C-D-A.\n\nWait, let's check B-D-C-A: BD=3, DC=4, CA=6, so total 3+4+6=13. Similarly, B-D-A-C: BD=3, DA=5, AC=6, total 3+5+6=14. Wait, so the minimal is 13 via B-D-C-A.\n\nWait, but in the second path for starting at B, B-C-D-A is BC=5, CD=4, DA=5, total 5+4+5=14. So, the minimal is 13 via B-D-C-A.\n\nWait, but in the first path, B-D-C-A is 3+4+6=13. So, yes, 13.\n\nStarting at C:\n\nPossible paths:\n\nC -> A -> B -> D: CA + AB + BD=6 +6 +3=15\n\nC -> A -> D -> B: CA + AD + DB=6 +5 +3=14\n\nC -> B -> A -> D: CB + BA + AD=5 +6 +5=16\n\nC -> B -> D -> A: CB + BD + DA=5 +3 +5=13\n\nC -> D -> A -> B: CD + DA + AB=4 +5 +6=15\n\nC -> D -> B -> A: CD + DB + BA=4 +3 +6=13\n\nSo, starting at C, the minimal path is 13 via C-B-D-A or C-D-B-A.\n\nStarting at D:\n\nPossible paths:\n\nD -> A -> B -> C: DA + AB + BC=5 +6 +5=16\n\nD -> A -> C -> B: DA + AC + CB=5 +6 +5=16\n\nD -> B -> A -> C: DB + BA + AC=3 +6 +6=15\n\nD -> B -> C -> A: DB + BC + CA=3 +5 +6=14\n\nD -> C -> A -> B: DC + CA + AB=4 +6 +6=16\n\nD -> C -> B -> A: DC + CB + BA=4 +5 +6=15\n\nSo, starting at D, the minimal path is 14 via D-B-C-A or D-C-B-A.\n\nWait, let's verify:\n\nFor D -> B -> C -> A: DB=3, BC=5, CA=6, total 3+5+6=14.\n\nSimilarly, D -> C -> B -> A: DC=4, CB=5, BA=6, total 4+5+6=15. So, the minimal is 14.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Starting at A: minimal 13\n\n- Starting at B: minimal 13\n\n- Starting at C: minimal 13\n\n- Starting at D: minimal 14\n\nTherefore, the minimal total distance is 13.\n\nBut let me double-check these calculations because sometimes there might be a shorter path that I missed.\n\nStarting at A:\n\nA-B-D-C: 6 +3 +4=13\n\nA-C-D-B:6 +4 +3=13\n\nStarting at B:\n\nB-D-C-A:3 +4 +6=13\n\nB-D-A-C:3 +5 +6=14\n\nB-C-D-A:5 +4 +5=14\n\nB-D-C-A:3 +4 +6=13\n\nStarting at C:\n\nC-B-D-A:5 +3 +5=13\n\nC-D-B-A:4 +3 +6=13\n\nStarting at D:\n\nD-B-C-A:3 +5 +6=14\n\nD-C-B-A:4 +5 +6=15\n\nYes, seems consistent. So, all starting points except D have a minimal path of 13, and D is 14. Therefore, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other possible paths that might have a shorter length. For example, is there a path starting at A that goes A-C-B-D? Let's compute that: AC=6, CB=5, BD=3, total 6+5+3=14. Which is longer than 13.\n\nSimilarly, starting at A: A-D-B-C: AD=5, DB=3, BC=5, total 5+3+5=13. Which is the same as A-B-D-C.\n\nSo, all possible permutations starting at A give either 13 or 15, 14, etc. So, 13 is the minimal for A.\n\nSimilarly, starting at B, the minimal is 13.\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible distance is 13.\n\nBut let me just confirm once more if there's a different path that I haven't considered. For example, starting at D, is there a path that goes through C first? D-C-B-A: DC=4, CB=5, BA=6, total 15. D-C-A-B: DC=4, CA=", "answer": "13"}
