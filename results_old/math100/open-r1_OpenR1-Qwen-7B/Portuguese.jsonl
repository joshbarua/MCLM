I have to find the length of DE in this right triangle. The diagram shows triangle DEF with a right angle at E. The problem states that sin D is 0.7, and the length of EF is 7. Hmm, right. Let me visualize the Asymptote code they provided. So, point F is at (0,0), D is at (sqrt(51),7), and E is at (0,7). The right angle is at E, which makes sense because E is on the y-axis between F (0,0) and D (sqrt(51),7). \n\nSince it's a right triangle at E, DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. They gave EF as 7, which is one of the legs. They want DE, the other leg, and they also mentioned sin D is 0.7. So, I need to relate sin D to the sides of the triangle. \n\nLet me recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. Angle D is at point D, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle D would be... Let's see. In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, which is (sqrt(51),7). The right angle is at E. So, angle D is one of the acute angles. The sides adjacent to angle D would be DE and DF? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle DEF, angle D is formed by sides ED and DF. Wait, maybe I should label the sides properly.\n\nIn triangle DEF, with right angle at E, the sides are:\n\n- Opposite angle D: EF (which is 7)\n- Adjacent to angle D: DE (which we need to find)\n- Hypotenuse: DF\n\nSo, sin D would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is EF / DF. So, sin D = EF / DF = 7 / DF. The problem says sin D is 0.7. Therefore, 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 7 / 0.7 = 10. So, the hypotenuse DF is 10. Then, since it's a right triangle, by the Pythagorean theorem, DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2. We know EF is 7, DF is 10, so DE^2 + 49 = 100. Therefore, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. So, DE is sqrt(51). Wait, but in the Asymptote code, they have D at (sqrt(51),7), which would make DE the horizontal distance from D to E. Since E is at (0,7), the x-coordinate of D is sqrt(51), so DE is indeed sqrt(51). That checks out. So, DE is sqrt(51), which is approximately 7.1414, but they want the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, let me confirm once again. If angle D has sin D = 0.7, which is 7/10. So, the opposite side over hypotenuse is 7/10, so hypotenuse is 10. Then the other leg is sqrt(10^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(51). So, DE is sqrt(51). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(51). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem. Maybe using coordinates. The coordinates given are D (sqrt(51),7), E (0,7), F (0,0). So, DE is the distance between D and E. Since they have the same y-coordinate, 7, DE is just the difference in x-coordinates. So, DE = sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). So, that's straightforward. Then, EF is the distance from E (0,7) to F (0,0), which is 7 units vertically, so that's 7, which matches the problem statement. \n\nSo, both methods confirm that DE is sqrt(51).

Let me start by recalling how rotation works in the complex plane. \n\nFrom what I remember, rotating a complex number around another point involves a few steps. First, you translate the complex plane so that the center of rotation, which is c here, moves to the origin. Then you rotate the translated point by the desired angle, and finally translate back by moving the origin back to c. \n\nSo, the general formula for rotating a complex number z around a point c by an angle θ should be: \n\nw = (z - c) * e^{iθ} + c\n\nWhere e^{iθ} represents the rotation factor. Since the rotation is counterclockwise by π/4, θ is π/4, so e^{iπ/4} is equal to cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4), which is √2/2 + i√2/2. \n\nLet me write down the given values first. \n\nz is given as 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i. Let me express that in terms of real and imaginary parts. The real part is 2 + √2, and the imaginary part is -(3 + 3√2). So z = (2 + √2) + (-3 - 3√2)i. \n\nc is given as 2 - 3i. So the real part is 2, and the imaginary part is -3. \n\nTo perform the rotation, I need to compute (z - c) * e^{iπ/4} + c. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, compute z - c. \n\nz - c = [(2 + √2) + (-3 - 3√2)i] - [2 - 3i] \n\nSubtracting the real parts: (2 + √2) - 2 = √2\n\nSubtracting the imaginary parts: (-3 - 3√2)i - (-3i) = (-3 - 3√2 + 3)i = (-3√2)i\n\nSo z - c = √2 - 3√2 i. \n\nNow, I need to multiply this by e^{iπ/4}, which is √2/2 + i√2/2. Let's write that multiplication out. \n\nLet me denote a = √2 and b = -3√2. So z - c = a + b i. Then multiplying by e^{iπ/4} gives:\n\n(a + b i)(√2/2 + i√2/2) \n\nLet's expand this product:\n\nFirst, multiply a by √2/2: a * √2/2 = √2 * √2/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nThen, a * i√2/2 = √2 * i√2 / 2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\nNext, b i * √2/2 = (-3√2) * i * √2 / 2 = (-3 * 2 * i)/2 = -3i\n\nThen, b i * i√2/2 = (-3√2) * i^2 * √2 / 2 = (-3√2) * (-1) * √2 / 2 = (3 * 2) / 2 = 3\n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\n(a + b i)(√2/2 + i√2/2) \n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. a * √2/2 = (√2)(√2)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\n2. a * i√2/2 = √2 * i√2 / 2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\n3. b i * √2/2 = (-3√2) * i * √2 / 2 = (-3 * √2 * √2) * i / 2 = (-3*2 * i)/2 = -3i\n\n4. b i * i√2/2 = (-3√2) * i^2 * √2 / 2 = (-3√2) * (-1) * √2 / 2 = (3√2 * √2)/2 = (3*2)/2 = 3\n\nSo adding all these terms together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i\n\nSo the product (z - c) * e^{iπ/4} is 4 - 2i. \n\nThen, we add c back to this result. c is 2 - 3i. So:\n\nw = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, z - c:\n\nz is (2 + √2) + (-3 - 3√2)i\n\nc is 2 - 3i\n\nSubtracting c from z:\n\nReal part: (2 + √2) - 2 = √2\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3√2)i - (-3i) = (-3 - 3√2 + 3)i = (-3√2)i\n\nSo z - c is √2 - 3√2 i. That's correct.\n\nMultiplying by e^{iπ/4} which is √2/2 + i√2/2. Let's denote that as (√2/2)(1 + i)\n\nSo multiplying (√2 - 3√2 i) by (√2/2)(1 + i):\n\nFirst, factor out √2 from the first term:\n\n√2(1 - 3i) * (√2/2)(1 + i)\n\nMultiply √2 * √2/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nSo it's (1 - 3i)(1 + i)\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n1*1 + 1*i - 3i*1 - 3i*i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i²\n\nSince i² = -1, so:\n\n1 + (i - 3i) - 3(-1) = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i\n\nYes, that's the same as before. Then adding c (2 - 3i):\n\n4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i\n\nSo the result is 6 - 5i. \n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication step. Let's do it without factoring:\n\n(√2 - 3√2 i)(√2/2 + i√2/2)\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: √2 * i√2/2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\nThird term: -3√2 i * √2/2 = (-3*2 i)/2 = -3i\n\nFourth term: -3√2 i * i√2/2 = (-3√2 * √2 i²)/2 = (-3*2*(-1))/2 = (6)/2 = 3\n\nSo adding all terms: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. Correct. Then adding c: 4 -2i + 2 -3i = 6 -5i. \n\nTherefore, the final result is 6 -5i. \n\nBut let me visualize this to make sure. The original point z is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). The center of rotation c is (2, -3). So translating z by subtracting c, we get (√2, -3√2). Rotating this by 45 degrees counterclockwise. \n\nThe rotation matrix for 45 degrees is [cosθ -sinθ; sinθ cosθ], which for θ = π/4 is [√2/2 -√2/2; √2/2 √2/2]. \n\nSo applying the rotation matrix to the translated point (√2, -3√2):\n\nNew x-coordinate: √2 * √2/2 - (-3√2) * √2/2 = (2)/2 + (3*2)/2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNew y-coordinate: √2 * √2/2 + (-3√2) * √2/2 = (2)/2 + (-3*2)/2 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nSo after rotation, the translated point is (4, -2). Then translating back by adding c (2, -3): (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5). \n\nSo the complex number is 6 -5i. That matches the previous result. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is w = 6 -5i. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6 - 5i}\n</think>\n\nTo find the complex number \\( w \\) resulting from rotating \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) around \\( c = 2 - 3i \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians counterclockwise, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\)**:\n   \\[\n   z - c = \\left( (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2 \\right) + \\left( - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Real part: } 2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Imaginary part: } - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i + 3i = -3\\sqrt{2}i\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\).\n\n2. **Rotate the translated point by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)**:\n   The rotation factor for \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians is \\( e^{i\\pi/4} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\n   Multiply \\( z - c \\) by this rotation factor:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i) \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Expanding the product:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\cdot i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{2} + i\\frac{2}{2} - 3i\\frac{2}{2} - 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot i^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + i - 3i + 3\n   \\]\n   Combining terms:\n   \\[\n   4 - 2i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Translate back by adding \\( c \\)**:\n   \\[\n   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the result of the rotation is \\(\\boxed{6 - 5i}\\).", "answer": "6 - 5i"}
{"original_question": "Simplifique $\\sqrt{242}$.", "question": "Simplifique $\\sqrt{242}$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the square root of 242. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that simplifying a square root involves breaking down the number into its prime factors and then seeing if any of those factors can be taken out as a whole number. Right?\n\nAlright, let's start by factoring 242. Let me divide 242 by the smallest prime numbers first. Let's see, 242 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. 242 divided by 2 is 121. So, 2 times 121 equals 242. Now, I need to factor 121. Hmm, 121 is a square number, isn't it? Yes, 11 times 11 is 121. So, putting that all together, the prime factors of 242 are 2, 11, and 11. So, 242 = 2 × 11 × 11.\n\nNow, when we take the square root of a product, it's the same as the product of the square roots. So, √(242) is the same as √(2 × 11 × 11). Let's break that down. The square root of 2 stays as √2 because 2 isn't a perfect square. Then, the square root of 11 × 11 is √(11²), which simplifies to 11. So, putting those together, √242 = √2 × 11. Which is the same as 11√2.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I square 11√2, does that give me 242? Let's see: (11√2)² = 11² × (√2)² = 121 × 2 = 242. Yep, that works. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me try dividing 242 by other primes to confirm the factors. Starting with 2, as before, 242 ÷ 2 = 121. Then 121 ÷ 11 = 11, and 11 ÷ 11 = 1. So, that's the same as before. So, the prime factorization is indeed 2 × 11².\n\nSo, when simplifying the square root, any pair of the same factors can be taken out as a single number. So, since we have 11², we can take one 11 out, leaving √2 behind. Therefore, √242 simplifies to 11√2. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. Let me just recap. The steps are: factor the number under the square root into primes, pair up the factors, take one from each pair out as a whole number, and leave the remaining primes under the square root. Since 242 factors into 2 and 11², we take one 11 out and leave the 2. So, the simplified form is 11√2.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check another example. If I take √98, for instance. 98 factors into 2 × 49, which is 2 × 7². So, √98 = √(2 × 7²) = 7√2. Which is correct. So, the same method applies here. So, applying the same logic to 242, which factors into 2 × 11², gives us 11√2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that 242 is twice 121, which is a perfect square. So, √(2 × 121) = √2 × √121 = √2 × 11 = 11√2. That's another way to look at it. Since 242 = 2 × 121, and 121 is a perfect square, we can take its square root out of the radical. That also leads to the same result.\n\nTherefore, I feel confident that the simplified form of √242 is 11√2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified form of $\\sqrt{242}$ is \\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{242}\\), we start by factoring 242 into its prime factors. \n\nFirst, we note that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:\n\\[\n242 \\div 2 = 121\n\\]\nNext, we factor 121, which is a perfect square:\n\\[\n121 = 11 \\times 11\n\\]\nThus, the prime factorization of 242 is:\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\times 11 \\times 11 = 2 \\times 11^2\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of this product, we can separate the factors:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 11^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{11^2}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sqrt{11^2} = 11\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = 11 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 11\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nVerification by squaring \\(11\\sqrt{2}\\) confirms the result:\n\\[\n(11\\sqrt{2})^2 = 11^2 \\times (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 121 \\times 2 = 242\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{242}\\) is \\(\\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}\\).", "answer": "11\\sqrt2"}

(Duas disposições são consideradas iguais se uma for uma rotação da outra.)", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: How many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together? The note says that two arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, when arranging people around a round table, the usual approach is to fix one person's position to account for rotational symmetry. Normally, if everyone can sit anywhere, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! But here, three specific people want to sit together. So, maybe I can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit or \"block.\" That way, instead of arranging 8 individuals, I'm arranging 6 units: the block of the three and the other 5 people.\n\nIf I consider the block as a single entity, then the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around the table would be (6-1)! = 5! because it's a circular arrangement. But wait, the people within the block can also rearrange themselves, right? So, the three people in the block can be arranged among themselves in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements should be 5! multiplied by 3!.\n\nLet me verify that. Normally, for linear arrangements where three people must be together, we would have 3! ways to arrange them and (n-3)! ways for the rest, so total (n-3)! * 3!. But since it's a circular table, we have to adjust for rotational symmetry.\n\nIn linear arrangements, fixing the block gives (n-3+1)! = (n-2)! But here, circular arrangements require fixing one position, so maybe (n-1)! but with the block. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's say we fix Pierre's position. Then, Rosa and Thomas need to be seated next to him. Wait, but if we fix Pierre's seat, then the seats adjacent to him are fixed for Rosa and Thomas? Hmm, maybe not. Because in a circular table, each person has two neighbors, but if we fix Pierre's seat, the two seats next to him are specific seats. So, Rosa and Thomas could be sitting in those two seats, but maybe not necessarily adjacent to Pierre. Wait, no, if they want to sit together, they need to form a block. So, if Pierre is fixed, then the block must be somewhere around the table. But fixing Pierre's position might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe I should first consider the total number of circular arrangements without any restrictions. That would be (8-1)! = 7!.\n\nBut when three people need to sit together, we can treat them as a single entity. So, instead of 8 people, we have 6 entities: the block and the other 5. The number of circular arrangements for 6 entities is (6-1)! = 5!. Then, within the block, the three people can be arranged in 3! ways. So, total arrangements are 5! * 3!.\n\nBut wait, does fixing the block's position affect rotational symmetry? Let me think. If we treat the block as a single entity, arranging them around the table would involve rotating the entire block. Wait, but in circular permutations, fixing one entity's position can help avoid overcounting rotations. So, if we fix the block in a specific position, then the number of arrangements is (number of entities -1)! * arrangements within the block.\n\nBut actually, when we treat the block as a single entity, the total number of circular arrangements is (number of entities -1)! which is 5! here, and then multiplied by the internal arrangements of the block, which is 3!. So, 5! * 3!.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't fix any position, the total would be (6-1)! * 3! = 5! * 3!.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we first consider linear arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must be together. In linear arrangements, the number would be 3! * (8-3)! = 3! * 5! Then, for circular arrangements, we divide by 8 to account for rotational symmetry? Wait, but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, in linear arrangements, circular arrangements can be obtained by fixing one position, so dividing by n. But actually, the formula for circular permutations with a block is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall that in circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n people where k specific people must be together is (n - k)! * k! So, here, n=8, k=3, so (8-3)! * 3! = 5! * 6. But wait, that's 120 * 6 = 720. But 7! is 5040, so 720 is much smaller, which seems plausible.\n\nBut let's verify with another method. Let's fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. Suppose we fix Pierre's seat. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But we want Rosa and Thomas to be next to Pierre. Wait, but if Pierre is fixed, then the seats adjacent to him are specific. So, Rosa and Thomas need to be seated in the two seats next to Pierre? Wait, no, if they are sitting together, they need to form a block. So, if Pierre is fixed, the block must be in some position around the table.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix Pierre's seat, then the block can be placed in 2 different ways relative to Pierre: either Rosa and Thomas are to his left and right, but since they need to sit together, they can be arranged in 3! ways. Wait, maybe this approach is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try again. When arranging in a circle, fixing one person's position is a common technique. Let's fix Pierre's position. Now, the problem reduces to arranging the remaining 7 people, but Rosa and Thomas must be seated next to Pierre. Wait, but if we fix Pierre's position, the two neighbors are fixed as well. So, Rosa and Thomas must occupy those two specific seats next to Pierre. But if that's the case, then Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2! ways (since they can switch places). Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 seats in 5! ways. But then, what about the block? Wait, if we fixed Pierre's position, then the block (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) is in three consecutive seats. Wait, but if we fix Pierre's seat, the block can be in different positions? No, if we fix Pierre's seat, the block must occupy three seats including Pierre's seat. Wait, but in a circular table, the block can be rotated, but since we fixed Pierre's seat, the block can only be in one specific position: Pierre's seat and the two adjacent seats. Therefore, once we fix Pierre's seat, the block is fixed in those three seats, and Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2! ways. Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways. So total arrangements would be 2! * 5! = 240.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous answer of 5! * 3! = 720. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think again. If we fix Pierre's seat, then we have 7 seats left. But if Rosa and Thomas must be next to Pierre, then they must occupy the two seats adjacent to him. So, those two seats are fixed. So, Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in those two seats in 2! ways. Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 seats in 5! ways. So total arrangements: 2! * 5! = 240.\n\nBut if we consider the block as a single entity, then we have 6 entities: the block and 5 others. The number of circular arrangements is (6-1)! = 120. Then, multiply by 3! for the internal arrangements of the block: 120 * 6 = 720. But this contradicts the 240 result.\n\nSo, there's a conflict here. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in how we account for the fixed position. If we fix Pierre's seat, then the block is fixed in the three seats around him. Therefore, the internal arrangements of the block are already considered. Wait, but if the block is fixed, then the internal arrangements are 3! ways. But if we fix Pierre's seat, the block is fixed in position, so the internal arrangements would be 3! (since the block can be arranged in any order around Pierre's seat). Wait, but if the block is fixed in position (i.e., Pierre is in a specific seat, and the two adjacent seats are for Rosa and Thomas), then the block can be arranged in 3! ways (Pierre in the middle, Rosa and Thomas on either side, but since we fixed Pierre's seat, Rosa and Thomas can be swapped). Wait, no. If we fix Pierre's seat, the two adjacent seats are fixed for Rosa and Thomas. So, Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2! ways (Rosa on the left, Thomas on the right, or vice versa). Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways. So total arrangements: 2! * 5! = 240.\n\nBut if we treat the block as a single entity, then in circular arrangements, fixing the block's position would require (6-1)! = 5! arrangements for the block and others, but since the block is fixed, the internal arrangements are 3!. So total 5! * 3! = 720. But this contradicts the previous result.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is whether the block is considered as a single entity or not. If we treat them as a single entity, then the number of arrangements is (6-1)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 720. But if we fix one person's seat, the block can only be in one position, so the arrangements would be 2! * 5! = 240. These two numbers are different. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the different methods. Let's check with a smaller example. Suppose there are 3 people: Pierre, Rosa, Thomas. How many circular arrangements if they all have to sit together? Well, in a circle of 3, the number of arrangements is (3-1)! = 2. But if they must sit together, it's the same as arranging the block, which would be 1! (since it's a single entity) * 3! = 6. But that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, no, in a circular table with 3 people, all sitting together, the number of arrangements is 2, because it's a circle: clockwise and counter-clockwise. But if you consider them as a block, then the number of arrangements is (3-1)! = 2, which is the same. However, if you fix one person's position, say Pierre, then Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So that matches. But if you use the block method, treating them as a single entity, the number of arrangements is (3-1)! * 3! / 3 = 2! * 6 / 3 = 4. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the formula isn't (n-1)! * k! for circular arrangements with a block. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is:\n\nFor circular arrangements where a subset must be together:\n\n1. Treat the subset as a single entity. Then, the total number of entities is (n - k + 1). For circular arrangements, the number of arrangements is (n - k)! because we fix one entity to account for rotational symmetry. Then, multiply by k! for the internal arrangements of the subset.\n\nSo, in the case of 3 people around a table, n=3, k=3. Then, (3 - 3)! * 3! = 0! * 6 = 6. But in reality, circular arrangements of 3 people is 2. So that formula doesn't hold. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe for circular arrangements where a subset must be together, the formula is (n - k + 1 - 1)! * k! So, (n - k)! * k!.\n\nBut in the case of n=3, k=3, that would be (0)! * 6 = 6, which is still wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when the entire group must be together in a circular table, the number of arrangements is (k-1)! * (n - k + 1)! So, for n=3, k=3, it would be (2)! * (1)! = 2*1=2, which is correct. For n=8, k=3, it would be (2)! * (6)! = 2*720=1440. But this contradicts the previous answers.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have n people around a circular table, and k of them want to sit together. To count the number of arrangements:\n\n1. Treat the k people as a single block. So, we have (n - k + 1) entities: the block and (n - k) individuals.\n\n2. For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange these entities is (n - k + 1 - 1)! = (n - k)! because in circular arrangements, fixing one entity's position removes rotational symmetry.\n\n3. Then, multiply by the number of ways to arrange the k people within the block, which is k!.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements: (n - k)! * k!.\n\nBut in the case of n=3, k=3: (0)! * 3! = 1 * 6 = 6, which is wrong because circular arrangements should be 2. So, this formula doesn't work. Therefore, my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let's consider linear arrangements first. For linear arrangements, if k people must be together, we treat them as a block, so we have (n - k + 1) blocks. The number of arrangements is (n - k + 1)! * k!.\n\nBut for circular arrangements, we have to adjust for rotational symmetry. So, if we fix one position, say, the block's position, then the number of arrangements is (n - k)! * k!.\n\nWait, for n=3, k=3: (3 - 3)! * 3! = 0! * 6 = 6. But in circular arrangements, we should have (3-1)! = 2. So, this still doesn't align. So, what's the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps when the entire group is considered as a block in a circular arrangement, fixing their position removes the rotational symmetry. So, in linear arrangements, the number of arrangements is (n - k + 1)! *", "answer": "720"}

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which gives each term as \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the binomial theorem formula: \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\). In this problem, \\(a = 10x^3\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n = 5\\). So each term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\). \n\nThe goal is to find the term where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero, because that will be the constant term. So I need to figure out for which value of \\(k\\) the exponent of \\(x\\) in the term becomes zero.\n\nLet me break down the exponents. Let's consider the term \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\). \n\nFirst, \\((10x^3)^{5 - k}\\) will have an exponent of \\(x\\) equal to \\(3(5 - k)\\). Then, \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\) will have an exponent of \\(x\\) equal to \\(-2k\\). \n\nSo combining these exponents, the total exponent of \\(x\\) in each term is \\(3(5 - k) - 2k\\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\\).\n\nWe need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So set up the equation:\n\n\\(15 - 5k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(15 = 5k\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nOkay, so when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero. Therefore, the term corresponding to \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Now, let's compute that term.\n\nThe term is \\(\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5 - 3} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\).\n\nFirst, compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). Since \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so:\n\n\\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{3! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\\).\n\nNext, compute \\((10x^3)^{5 - 3} = (10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6\\).\n\nThen, compute \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 x^{-6} = -\\frac{1}{8}x^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, multiply all these together:\n\n\\(10 \\times 100x^6 \\times -\\frac{1}{8}x^{-6}\\).\n\nFirst, multiply the constants: \\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\), then \\(1000 \\times -\\frac{1}{8} = -125\\).\n\nThen, multiply the \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^6 \\times x^{-6} = x^{6 - 6} = x^0 = 1\\).\n\nSo the entire term is \\(-125 \\times 1 = -125\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in the expansion is \\(-125\\).\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through each step again.\n\n1. Binomial theorem: Correct. Each term is \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} (-1/(2x^2))^k\\).\n\n2. Exponent of x: Calculated as \\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 5k\\). Set to zero gives k = 3. That seems right.\n\n3. Binomial coefficient: \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\). Correct, since 5 choose 3 is 10.\n\n4. (10x^3)^2: 10^2 = 100, x^3 squared is x^6. Correct.\n\n5. (-1/(2x^2))^3: (-1/2)^3 = -1/8, x^{-6}. Correct.\n\n6. Multiply constants: 10 * 100 = 1000, 1000 * -1/8 = -125. Correct.\n\n7. x terms: x^6 * x^{-6} = x^0 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore, the constant term is indeed -125. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe constant term is \\boxed{-125}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\), we use the binomial theorem.

The problem says that if n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, we need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm. So, n ≡ 2 mod 7. That means n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to substitute that directly. Instead, I can work with the congruences.\n\nSince n ≡ 2 mod 7, then adding 2 to both sides gives n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7. Similarly, n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7, and n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 ≡ 8 mod 7. Wait, 8 mod 7 is 1, right? Because 7*1 = 7, so 8 - 7 = 1. So n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nSo now, the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) ≡ 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. Let me compute that step by step. First, 4 multiplied by 6 is 24. Then 24 multiplied by 1 is 24. So 24 mod 7. Hmm, 7*3=21, so 24 - 21 = 3. Therefore, 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. So the remainder should be 3. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with n ≡ 2 mod 7. Then:\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7. Correct.\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7. Correct.\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. Correct.\n\nMultiplying them: 4 * 6 = 24. Then 24 * 1 = 24. 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3. Yes, that's right. So 24 mod 7 is 3. Therefore, the remainder is 3. Hmm, seems straightforward. Maybe there's another way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, suppose n is 2 mod 7. Let's pick a specific number for n that is 2 mod 7. For example, n = 2. Then (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 192. Then 192 divided by 7: 7*27=189, 192 - 189=3. So remainder 3. Same result.\n\nAnother example: n = 9 (since 9 mod 7 is 2). Then (9 + 2)(9 + 4)(9 + 6) = 11 * 13 * 15. Let's compute that. 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Now divide 2145 by 7: 7*300=2100, 2145 - 2100=45. 45 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, remainder 3. So again, remainder 3. So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic properties. Since we're working mod 7, the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) can be considered as (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7. Given that n ≡ 2 mod 7, substitute n with 2 in each term:\n\n(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4*6*8. As before, 4*6=24, 24*8=192. 192 mod 7. Let's compute 7*27=189, 192-189=3. So again 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the expression. Let's see: (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Expanding this might be complicated, but perhaps we can use the fact that n ≡ 2 mod 7. Alternatively, note that n + 2, n + 4, n + 6 are three consecutive even numbers? Wait, no. Let's see: if n is 2 mod 7, then n + 2 is 4 mod 7, n + 4 is 6 mod 7, n + 6 is 8 mod 7 which is 1 mod 7. So they are 4, 6, 1. So multiplying those gives 4*6*1=24≡3 mod7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the terms as (n + 2), (n + 4), (n + 6). Since n ≡2 mod7, each term is 2 + 0, 2 + 2, 2 + 4 mod7. Wait, no. Wait, n ≡2 mod7, so adding 2, 4, 6 to n gives n + 2 ≡4, n +4≡6, n +6≡8≡1 mod7. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the properties of modular arithmetic. Since multiplication is compatible with congruence, we can compute each term modulo 7 first, then multiply the results modulo 7. So:\n\n(n + 2) ≡ (2 + 2) ≡4 mod7,\n\n(n + 4) ≡ (2 +4)≡6 mod7,\n\n(n +6)≡(2 +6)≡8≡1 mod7.\n\nTherefore, the product is 4*6*1=24≡3 mod7. So the remainder is 3.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the remainder is 3. So I think the answer is 3, and I can box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\) into each term of the product:\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nNext, we compute the product of these congruences modulo 7:\n\\[\n(4)(6)(1) \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n- \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 1 = 24 \\)\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:\n\\[\n24 \\div 7 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).", "answer": "3"}

Qual é o número mínimo de graus que ele deve ser girado até coincidir com sua posição original?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a regular pentagon that's being rotated anticlockwise around its center. The question is asking for the minimum number of degrees it needs to be rotated to get back to its original position. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that regular polygons have rotational symmetry. That means if you rotate them around their center, they'll look the same after certain angles. For a regular pentagon, which has five sides, how does this work? \n\nI recall that the formula for the angle of rotational symmetry for a regular polygon with n sides is 360 degrees divided by n. So in this case, since it's a pentagon, n is 5. Let me check that. If I divide 360 by 5, that gives 72 degrees. So does that mean you can rotate the pentagon by 72 degrees and it will look the same? Yeah, that seems right. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of degrees needed to coincide with the original position. So if you rotate it 72 degrees, does that bring it back? Let me visualize. If you have a regular pentagon and you rotate it 72 degrees, each vertex moves one spot over. Since there are five vertices, rotating by 72 degrees would effectively rotate each vertex to the position of the next one. So after five such rotations, each vertex would have cycled through all positions, right? So 5 times 72 is 360 degrees, which is a full rotation. So that makes sense. \n\nBut the problem specifies that the rotation is anticlockwise. Does that affect anything? Hmm, maybe not because whether you rotate clockwise or anticlockwise, the angle needed to return to the original position is the same. The direction just determines the direction of rotation. So whether it's 72 degrees anticlockwise or 360 - 72 = 288 degrees clockwise, the minimum positive angle is 72 degrees. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the minimum number of degrees. So 72 is the smallest angle that will make the pentagon coincide with its original position. If we try a smaller angle, like 36 degrees, would that work? Let me check. If you rotate 36 degrees, would the pentagon still look the same? Well, 36 doesn't divide evenly into 360 when considering the number of sides. 360 divided by 5 is 72, so 36 is half of that. If you rotate by 36 degrees, the vertices wouldn't be in the same position as the original. So 72 is indeed the smallest angle needed. \n\nTherefore, the minimum number of degrees should be 72. Let me just confirm once more. For a regular polygon with n sides, the smallest angle of rotation that maps the polygon onto itself is 360/n degrees. Since 5 is prime, there's no smaller angle except 360/5. So yeah, 72 degrees. \n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 72 degrees. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum number of degrees is \\boxed{72}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated anticlockwise around its center to coincide with its original position, we consider the rotational symmetry of regular polygons. \n\nA regular pentagon has five sides, and the formula for the angle of rotational symmetry for a regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides is \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} \\). For a pentagon, this is \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ \\).\n\nRotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will move each vertex to the position of the next vertex. After five such rotations (each 72 degrees), the pentagon will have completed a full 360-degree rotation and returned to its original position. \n\nThus, the minimum number of degrees required for the pentagon to coincide with its original position is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).", "answer": "72"}

The problem is about a parallelogram with coordinates (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) where x is greater than 7. We need to find x + y. Hmm, parallelograms have opposite sides that are equal and parallel, right? So maybe I can use the properties of parallelograms to figure out the missing coordinates.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. That means the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. So if I can find the midpoints of the diagonals, they should be equal. Let me try that.\n\nBut wait, I need to know which points are opposite vertices. The problem lists the four points as (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). Since it's a parallelogram, the order of the points matters. But the problem doesn't specify the order, so maybe I need to consider different possibilities for which points are adjacent or opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vector addition. In a parallelogram, the vector from one vertex to another should be the same as the vector from the opposite vertex to the missing vertex. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we take two points as adjacent vertices. Let's say (5,3) and (6,8) are adjacent. Then the vector from (5,3) to (6,8) is (1,5). Then the opposite vertex from (7,4) should be (7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8,9). But wait, (x,y) is supposed to be greater than 7, so x=8, y=9. Then x + y would be 17. But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (5,3) and (7,4) are adjacent. The vector from (5,3) to (7,4) is (2,1). Then the opposite vertex from (6,8) would be (6 + 2, 8 + 1) = (8,9). Again, x=8, y=9. So same answer. Hmm, so regardless of which two points are adjacent, the opposite vertex is (8,9). But wait, let me verify.\n\nWait, maybe another pair. If (6,8) and (7,4) are adjacent. The vector from (6,8) to (7,4) is (1,-4). Then the opposite vertex from (5,3) would be (5 +1, 3 -4) = (6,-1). But (6,-1) is not greater than 7 in x-coordinate. So that can't be the case.\n\nSo if we consider (5,3) and (6,8) as adjacent, then the missing point is (8,9). If we consider (5,3) and (7,4) as adjacent, the missing point is also (8,9). If we consider (6,8) and (7,4) as adjacent, the missing point is (6,-1), which doesn't satisfy x>7. So the only possible missing point is (8,9). Therefore, x + y is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nBut let me check using the midpoint method. Let's suppose that (5,3) and (7,4) are opposite vertices. Then their midpoint is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6, 3.5). Then the other two vertices (6,8) and (x,y) should also have the same midpoint. So ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2) = (6, 3.5). Solving for x and y: (6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6. Similarly, (8 + y)/2 = 3.5 => 8 + y = 7 => y = -1. So that gives (6, -1), but x=6 which is not greater than 7. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if (5,3) and (6,8) are opposite vertices. Their midpoint is ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (5.5, 5.5). Then the other two vertices (7,4) and (x,y) should have the same midpoint. So ((7 + x)/2, (4 + y)/2) = (5.5, 5.5). Solving: (7 + x)/2 = 5.5 => 7 + x = 11 => x = 4. (4 + y)/2 = 5.5 => 4 + y = 11 => y = 7. So the missing point is (4,7). But x=4 which is not greater than 7. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: (5,3) and (x,y) are opposite. Then their midpoint is ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2). The other two vertices (6,8) and (7,4) have midpoint ((6 + 7)/2, (8 + 4)/2) = (6.5, 6). So setting the midpoints equal: ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2) = (6.5, 6). Solving: (5 + x)/2 = 6.5 => 5 + x = 13 => x = 8. (3 + y)/2 = 6 => 3 + y = 12 => y = 9. So that gives (8,9). Which is valid because x=8 >7. So this works.\n\nAlternatively, if (6,8) and (7,4) are opposite vertices, their midpoint is ((6+7)/2, (8+4)/2) = (6.5, 6). Then the other two vertices (5,3) and (x,y) must also have midpoint (6.5,6). So ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2) = (6.5,6). Then (5 + x)/2 = 6.5 => x = 8. (3 + y)/2 = 6 => y = 9. So again, (8,9). So regardless of which pair of points we take as opposite, the missing point is (8,9). Therefore, x + y is 17.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors. Let's say we have points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). In a parallelogram, the vector AB should equal the vector DC. Vector AB is (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). So DC should be (x -7, y -4) = (1,5). Therefore, x -7 =1 => x=8, y -4=5 => y=9. So D(8,9). Similarly, vector BC is (7-6,4-8)=(1,-4). Then vector AD should be equal to BC. So vector AD is (x -5, y -3)=(1,-4). So x -5=1 =>x=6, y -3=-4 => y=-1. But x=6 which is less than 7, so invalid. Alternatively, vector AB is (1,5), so DC is (1,5). So D is (7 +1,4 +5)=(8,9). Same result. So answer is 8 +9=17.\n\nAnother way: In a parallelogram, the sum of two adjacent vectors gives the diagonal. So if we take vectors from A to B and from A to D, then the diagonal from B to D is the sum of vectors AB and AD. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nBut all methods point towards the missing point being (8,9). Therefore, x + y is 17. So I think the answer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x + y \\) is \\boxed{17}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the coordinates of a parallelogram: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x > 7\\), we need to find the value of \\(x + y\\).\n\n1. **Using the property of diagonals bisecting each other**:\n   - The midpoint of the diagonal connecting (5, 3) and (7, 4) is \\(\\left(\\frac{5+7}{2}, \\frac{3+4}{2}\\right) = (6, 3.5)\\).\n   - The midpoint of the diagonal connecting (6, 8) and \\((x, y)\\) must also be \\((6, 3.5)\\).\n   - Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{6 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = (6, 3.5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \\implies 6 + x = 12 \\implies x = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8 + y}{2} = 3.5 \\implies 8 + y = 7 \\implies y = -1\n     \\]\n     - However, \\(x = 6\\) is not greater than 7, so this is invalid.\n\n2. **Using vector addition**:\n   - Considering vectors from (5, 3) to (6, 8) as \\((1, 5)\\).\n   - The opposite vertex from (7, 4) should be \\((7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8, 9)\\).\n   - Similarly, considering vectors from (5, 3) to (7, 4) as \\((2, 1)\\), the opposite vertex from (6, 8) would be \\((6 + 2, 8 + 1) = (8, 9)\\).\n\n3. **Midpoint method**:\n   - Considering (5, 3) and (6, 8) as adjacent vertices, their midpoint is \\(\\left(\\frac{5+6}{2}, \\frac{3+8}{2}\\right) = (5.5, 5.5)\\).\n   - The midpoint of the diagonal connecting (7, 4) and \\((x, y)\\) must also be \\((5.5, 5.5)\\).\n   - Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{7 + x}{2}, \\frac{4 + y}{2}\\right) = (5.5, 5.5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + x}{2} = 5.5 \\implies 7 + x = 11 \\implies x = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 + y}{2} = 5.5 \\implies 4 + y = 11 \\implies y = 7\n     \\]\n     - However, \\(x = 4\\) is not greater than 7, so this is invalid.\n\n4. **Considering opposite vertices**:\n   - If (5, 3) and (6, 8) are opposite vertices, their midpoint is \\((5.5, 5.5)\\).\n   - The other two vertices (7, 4) and \\((x, y)\\) must also have the same midpoint:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{7 + x}{2}, \\frac{4 + y}{2}\\right) = (5.5, 5.5)\n     \\]\n     Solving gives \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 7\\), which is invalid due to \\(x < 7\\).\n\n5. **Valid solution**:\n   - Considering (5, 3) and (7, 4) as opposite vertices, their midpoint is \\((6, 3.5)\\).\n   - The other two vertices (6, 8) and \\((x, y)\\) must also have the midpoint \\((6, 3.5)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{6 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = (6, 3.5)\n     \\]\n     Solving gives \\(x = 6\\) and \\(y = -1\\), which is invalid.\n\n6. **Final valid solution**:\n   - Considering the correct vectors and midpoints, the valid solution is found by ensuring \\(x > 7\\).

Qual é o valor de $\\tan A$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a right triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. It says that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the two non-right angles is 90 degrees. So angle A plus angle C must be 90 degrees. Since it's a right triangle with angle B = 90°, angles A and C are complementary.\n\nNow, the problem gives sin A = 2 cos A. I need to find tan A. I know that tan A is equal to sin A divided by cos A. So if I can find the ratio of sin A to cos A, that would give me tan A. But here, they're telling me that sin A is twice cos A. So maybe I can express tan A in terms of that.\n\nLet me write down the given equation: sin A = 2 cos A. If I divide both sides of this equation by cos A, I get (sin A)/cos A = 2. But (sin A)/cos A is exactly tan A! So that would mean tan A = 2. Wait, is that possible? That seems straightforward, but maybe I should verify.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the definitions. In a right-angled triangle, sin A is opposite over hypotenuse, and cos A is adjacent over hypotenuse. So if sin A = 2 cos A, then opposite/hypotenuse = 2*(adjacent/hypotenuse). The hypotenuse cancels out, so opposite = 2*adjacent. Therefore, the side opposite angle A is twice the length of the side adjacent to angle A.\n\nSo in this triangle, if the adjacent side is x, the opposite side is 2x. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse. Let's call the adjacent side x, the opposite side 2x, so hypotenuse h = sqrt(x² + (2x)²) = sqrt(x² + 4x²) = sqrt(5x²) = x*sqrt(5).\n\nTherefore, the sides are x, 2x, and x√5. Then, tan A is opposite over adjacent, which is (2x)/x = 2. So that confirms it. So tan A is 2. Hmm, seems like that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's suppose angle A is θ. Then, sin θ = 2 cos θ. Then, we can square both sides to use the Pythagorean identity. So sin²θ = 4 cos²θ. Then, we know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. Substituting sin²θ from above: 4 cos²θ + cos²θ = 1 => 5 cos²θ = 1 => cos²θ = 1/5 => cos θ = 1/√5 or -1/√5. But since θ is an acute angle in a right triangle, cosine is positive. So cos θ = 1/√5, then sin θ = 2/√5. Therefore, tan θ = sin θ / cos θ = (2/√5)/(1/√5) = 2. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo whether I use the ratio directly or solve for the sides and then compute tan A, I get 2. That seems solid. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, if angle A is in a right-angled triangle, then it must be acute, between 0 and 90 degrees. So sin and cos are both positive, so when I take the ratio, there's no issue with signs. Squaring also gives a valid result. So all steps seem okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that tan A = sin A / cos A, and if sin A = 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. That's the same answer as before. So all methods converge to 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of tan A is 2. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(\\angle B = 90^\\circ\\), we know that \\(\\sin A = 2 \\cos A\\).

We need to find the vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b, and the horizontal asymptote y=c, then compute a + b + c. Hmm, right. Let's start with the vertical asymptotes. \n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? Because the function would approach infinity there. So, first, I need to find the roots of the denominator x² -5x -14. Let me set that equal to zero: x² -5x -14 = 0. To solve this quadratic equation, maybe I can factor it. Let me check if it factors. The product of the roots is -14, and the sum is -5. Hmm, factors of -14: 1 and -14, 2 and -7. Let's see, 2 and -7: 2 -7 = -5. Yes! So, the equation factors as (x + 2)(x - 7) = 0. Let me check: x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Perfect. So, the roots are x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a and b are -2 and 7. \n\nWait, but vertical asymptotes are where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero at those points. Let me confirm that. At x = -2: numerator is 2*(-2) = -4, which is not zero. Denominator is zero, so yes, vertical asymptote there. At x =7: numerator is 2*7=14, denominator is zero. So, also a vertical asymptote. So, a and b are indeed -2 and 7. \n\nNow, horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. So, since the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So, c=0. \n\nTherefore, a + b + c is (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. \n\nWait, let me double-check everything. The vertical asymptotes at x=-2 and x=7: denominator factors correctly. Yes, (x+2)(x-7). Then, numerator at x=-2 is -4, which isn't zero. At x=7, numerator is 14, not zero. So, vertical asymptotes at those points. Degree of denominator is 2, numerator is 1, so horizontal asymptote at y=0. So, adding them: -2 +7 +0=5. \n\nHmm, seems straightforward. Maybe I should check if there's any hole or something. Holes occur when numerator and denominator share a common factor. Let's see, numerator is 2x, denominator is (x+2)(x-7). There are no common factors, so no holes. Therefore, only vertical asymptotes at x=-2 and x=7. So, answer is 5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we need to determine where the denominator is zero. The denominator is \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). Solving the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x - 7) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). These are the vertical asymptotes, so \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator \\( 2x \\) is a first-degree polynomial, and the denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) is a second-degree polynomial. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]", "answer": "5"}

Alright, first, maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me start with 99 squared. I remember that 99 is like 100 minus 1. Maybe there's a formula for squaring numbers near a multiple of 10. Oh yeah, the formula is (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². So if I let a be 100 and b be 1, then 99² would be (100 - 1)². Let's compute that.\n\nSo expanding that, it's 100² minus 2 times 100 times 1 plus 1². That's 10,000 minus 200 plus 1. Let me do that math: 10,000 minus 200 is 9,800, and then adding 1 gives me 9,801. Okay, so 99 squared is 9,801. Got that part down.\n\nNow, the next step is adding 99 to that result. So 9,801 plus 99. Let me think. 9,801 plus 100 would be 9,901, but since it's 99, that's one less than 100. So subtract 1 from 9,901 to get 9,900. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 9,801 plus 100 is 9,901, so 9,801 plus 99 is 9,901 minus 1, which is 9,900. Yeah, that makes sense. So after adding 99, we have 9,900.\n\nThen we need to add 1 more. So 9,900 plus 1 is 9,901. Wait, so putting it all together: 99² is 9,801, plus 99 is 9,900, plus 1 is 9,901. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at the original expression: 99² + 99 + 1. Let's see if we can factor something out. The first two terms have a common factor of 99. So 99*(99 + 1) + 1. That becomes 99*100 + 1. 99*100 is 9,900, and then adding 1 gives 9,901. Oh, that's a simpler way! So instead of calculating 99 squared first, factoring might be easier. But both methods lead to the same answer. That's a good check.\n\nSo either way, whether I compute 99 squared first and then add 99 and 1, or factor out the 99 and then compute, I end up with 9,901. Let me verify once more to be sure. 99 squared: 100 squared is 10,000. Subtract 2*100*1 + 1, which is 200 +1=201. So 10,000 - 201=9,799? Wait, wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, (a - b)^2 is a² - 2ab + b². So 100² is 10,000, 2ab is 2*100*1=200, and b² is 1. So 10,000 - 200 +1=9,801. Oh, right, because it's minus 2ab, so minus 200, then plus 1. So 10,000 - 200 is 9,800, plus 1 is 9,801. That's correct.\n\nThen 9,801 + 99. 9,801 + 100 is 9,901, minus 1 is 9,900. Then plus 1 is 9,901. Yes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, factoring: 99² +99 +1=99*(99 +1) +1=99*100 +1=9,900 +1=9,901. Perfect, that's straightforward.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using the formula for n² + n +1. Wait, but that's specific to certain problems. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that 99 is 100-1, so 99² +99 +1 can be written as (100 -1)^2 + (100 -1) +1. Let's expand that:\n\n(100 -1)^2 = 10,000 -200 +1=9,801\n\nThen add (100 -1): 9,801 +100 -1=9,801 +99=9,900\n\nThen add 1: 9,900 +1=9,901. Same result again.\n\nSo no matter which method I use, factoring or expanding, the answer is 9,901.

Hmm, I remember something about operator norms here. Let me think. The operator norm of a matrix with respect to the Euclidean norm (which is standard for vectors in R²) is the maximum value of ||Ax|| / ||x|| as x ranges over all non-zero vectors in R². So essentially, C would be the operator norm of that matrix. And the minimal such C is exactly this maximum value. So my job is to compute this operator norm.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a matrix A, the operator norm ||A|| is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of AᵀA. That seems like a solid approach.

So multiplying the first row by the first column:\n\n2*2 + 0*3 = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nFirst row by the second column:\n\n2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nSecond row of Aᵀ is [3, -2]. Multiplying by the columns of A:\n\nSecond row by first column:\n\n3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nSecond row by second column:\n\n3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nSo the product AᵀA is:\n\n[4   6]\n[6  13]\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(AᵀA - λI) = 0.\n\nSo let's write the matrix (AᵀA - λI):\n\n[4 - λ   6        ]\n[6       13 - λ ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 6*6 = (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst expand (4 - λ)(13 - λ):\n\n= 4*13 - 4λ -13λ + λ²\n= 52 - 17λ + λ²\n\nThen subtract 36:\n\n52 - 17λ + λ² - 36 = λ² -17λ +16\n\nSo the characteristic equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation. The discriminant is D = (-17)^2 - 4*1*16 = 289 -64 = 225\n\nSquare root of 225 is 15. So the roots are:\n\nλ = [17 ±15]/2\n\nSo:\n\nλ₁ = (17 +15)/2 = 32/2 =16\n\nλ₂ = (17 -15)/2 =2/2=1\n\nSo the eigenvalues of AᵀA are 16 and 1. Therefore, the largest eigenvalue is 16. Then the operator norm ||A|| is the square root of the largest eigenvalue, which is sqrt(16) = 4.\n\nWait, so does that mean C is 4? Let me verify this because sometimes I might mix up the steps.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about operator norms is that they are the maximum of ||Ax|| over all unit vectors x. So perhaps we can approach it by maximizing ||Ax|| where ||x||=1.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nLet x = [x; y] be a unit vector, so x² + y² =1. Then Ax is [2x +3y; -2y]. The norm squared of Ax is (2x +3y)^2 + (-2y)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(2x +3y)^2 + ( -2y )^2 = 4x² +12xy +9y² +4y² = 4x² +12xy +13y²\n\nSo we need to maximize 4x² +12xy +13y² subject to x² + y² =1.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem. To maximize f(x,y) =4x² +12xy +13y² with constraint g(x,y)=x² + y² -1=0.\n\nWe can use Lagrange multipliers. The gradient of f should be proportional to the gradient of g.\n\nCompute gradients:\n\n∇f = [8x +12y; 12x +26y]\n\n∇g = [2x; 2y]\n\nSo setting ∇f = λ∇g:\n\n8x +12y = 2λ x\n\n12x +26y = 2λ y\n\nAnd the constraint x² + y² =1.\n\nSo we have the system:\n\n1) 8x +12y = 2λ x\n\n2) 12x +26y = 2λ y\n\n3) x² + y² =1\n\nLet me rearrange equations 1 and 2:\n\nFrom equation 1: (8 -2λ)x +12y =0\n\nFrom equation 2:12x + (26 -2λ)y =0\n\nSo this is a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients matrix must be zero.\n\nSo the determinant:\n\n| (8 -2λ)    12       |\n| 12     (26 -2λ)  |\n\n= (8 -2λ)(26 -2λ) -144\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst expand (8 -2λ)(26 -2λ):\n\n=8*26 -8*2λ -2λ*26 +4λ²\n\n=208 -16λ -52λ +4λ²\n\n=208 -68λ +4λ²\n\nSubtract 144:\n\n208 -68λ +4λ² -144 =64 -68λ +4λ²\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n4λ² -68λ +64 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nλ² -17λ +16=0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before! So the eigenvalues are λ=16 and λ=1. So the maximum value of f(x,y) is 16, so the maximum ||Ax||² is 16, so the maximum ||Ax|| is 4. Therefore, C=4.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that the operator norm is the largest singular value of the matrix, which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of AᵀA, which we found to be 4. So that also gives the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 4. So the minimal C is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive real number \\( C \\) such that for any two-dimensional vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the norm \\( \\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| \\le C \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| \\), we need to compute the operator norm of the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThe operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \\( A^T A \\).

{"original_question": "Qual é $1^{(2^{235423523})}$?", "question": "Qual é $1^{(2^{235423523})}$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what 1 raised to the power of 2 raised to the 235423523. That seems like a really big exponent, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression is 1^(2^(235423523)). That's 1 raised to some huge exponent. But I remember that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, right? But here, the base is 1, not something else. Wait, but 1 raised to any power is always 1. Is that true?\n\nLet me check with smaller exponents. If I take 1^5, that's 1*1*1*1*1 = 1. Similarly, 1^3 is 1, and 1^1 is still 1. What about 1^0? Hmm, 1^0 is 1 by convention. So even if the exponent is 0, it's still 1. Therefore, no matter what the exponent is, as long as the base is 1, the result is 1. So even if the exponent is 2^(235423523), which is a gigantic number, 1 raised to that would still be 1.\n\nWait, but is there a case where 1 raised to a power isn't 1? Let me think. If the base were something other than 1, like 2^3 is 8, but if the base is 1, multiplying 1 by itself any number of times is still 1. So yeah, 1^n = 1 for any non-negative integer n. So even if n is 2^(235423523), which is a positive integer, then 1 raised to that power is 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a trick with the exponents here. The expression is 1^(2^235423523). Is that the same as [1^(2)]^235423523? Let me see. If I parenthesize it that way, then it would be (1^2)^235423523 = 1^235423523 = 1. So either way, whether you compute the exponent first or break it down, you end up with 1. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might confuse this with (1^2)^3, which is 1^3 = 1, but that's not the case here. The given problem is 1 raised to the power of (2 raised to 235423523). So the exponent is 2^235423523, not 2 multiplied by 235423523. So the exponent is a power tower here, but the base is still 1.\n\nAnother way to think about it: exponents are about repeated multiplication. So 1 to any power is just multiplying 1 by itself that many times. Since 1 times 1 is 1, no matter how many times you do it, it's always 1. Therefore, even an enormous number of 1s multiplied together is still 1. So regardless of the exponent, even a huge one, 1 raised to that is 1.\n\nI don't see any complications here. The key point is that the base is 1. If the base were something else, like 0 or -1, there might be different rules, but 1 is special in that exponentiation doesn't change its value. So I think the answer is straightforward: 1.\n\nLet me check with a simpler exponent. Suppose the problem was 1^(2^2). That's 1^4, which is 1. Similarly, 1^(2^3) is 1^8 = 1. So even when the exponent is a power of 2, it's still 1. So the size of the exponent doesn't matter here, only that it's a positive integer. Therefore, 1^(2^235423523) is 1.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and thinking through different angles, I'm confident that the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\), we start by recognizing that any number raised to the power of 1 is always 1. This applies regardless of the exponent, as long as the base is 1. \n\nWe can verify this with smaller exponents:\n- \\(1^5 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^3 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^0 = 1\\) (by convention)\n\nSince the base is 1, multiplying 1 by itself any number of times (even a very large number of times) will always result in 1. The exponent here is \\(2^{235423523}\\), which is a positive integer, so raising 1 to this power will still yield 1.\n\nEven if we consider the expression as \\([1^2]^{235423523}\\), this simplifies to \\(1^{235423523} = 1\\). Therefore, regardless of how we handle the exponent, the result remains 1.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "1"}

I have this problem where I need to calculate the expression \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\) given that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\). Hmm, so z is a fifth root of unity, but not 1 itself. I remember that the fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \\( z^5 = 1 \\), and they're evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. Since z isn't 1, it must be one of the other four roots.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of roots of unity. The fifth roots of unity satisfy the equation \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\), which factors as \\( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \\). So, since \\( z \\neq 1 \\), z must satisfy the quartic equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Let me try to simplify this. Let's note that \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) is the same as \\( z^4 \\) because \\( z^5 = 1 \\), so multiplying \\( z \\) by itself five times gives 1, which means \\( z^4 = \\frac{1}{z} \\). Similarly, \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \\). Wait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nIf \\( z^5 = 1 \\), then \\( z^5 = 1 \\implies z \\cdot z^4 = 1 \\implies z^4 = \\frac{1}{z} \\). Similarly, \\( z^2 \\cdot z^3 = 1 \\implies z^3 = \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). So, yes, \\( \\frac{1}{z} = z^4 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes \\( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \\).\n\nSo, the original expression simplifies to \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\). But wait, from the equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), we know that \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \\). Therefore, the expression is equal to -1. Is that it? Wait, let me verify step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the given expression:\n\n\\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\)\n\nSince \\( z^5 = 1 \\), we can write \\( \\frac{1}{z} = z^4 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \\). So substituting these in:\n\n\\( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \\)\n\nGrouping the terms:\n\n\\( (z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4) \\)\n\nFrom the equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), subtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\n\\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \\)\n\nTherefore, the expression \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\) is indeed equal to -1. So the answer should be -1. But let me check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider writing \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} \\) as a single term. Let me denote \\( S = z + \\frac{1}{z} \\). Then, the expression becomes \\( S + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Let's compute \\( S^2 \\):\n\n\\( S^2 = \\left( z + \\frac{1}{z} \\right)^2 = z^2 + 2 \\cdot z \\cdot \\frac{1}{z} + \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( S^2 = z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} + 2 \\). So, \\( z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} = S^2 - 2 \\). Then, the original expression is \\( S + (S^2 - 2) = S^2 + S - 2 \\).\n\nHmm, so if I can find the value of S, which is \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} \\), then I can compute the expression. Let's try this approach.\n\nFirst, compute S. Since z is a fifth root of unity, we know that \\( z^5 = 1 \\), so \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\), which factors as \\( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \\). Since z ≠ 1, we have \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). So, \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \\).\n\nBut S is \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} = z + z^4 \\). Let's denote S = z + z^4. Then, the remaining terms in the sum \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \\) are z^2 + z^3. Therefore, z^2 + z^3 = -1 - S.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nOriginal expression: S + z^2 + z^3 = S + (-1 - S) = -1. So that's the same result as before. So regardless of the approach, it seems the answer is -1.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute S = z + 1/z. Let me note that if we let ω = e^(2πi/5), which is a primitive fifth root of unity, then all the roots except 1 are ω, ω², ω³, ω⁴. Let's take z = ω. Then, S = ω + ω⁴. Since ω⁴ is the complex conjugate of ω (because e^(2πi/5) and e^(-2πi/5) are conjugates), so S is a real number. Similarly, z² + 1/z² would be ω² + ω³, which is also real. Therefore, the entire expression is real, which makes sense.\n\nBut let's compute S. Let's compute ω + ω⁴. Let me recall that ω = cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5), so ω⁴ = cos(8π/5) + i sin(8π/5). But 8π/5 is equivalent to -2π/5, so ω⁴ = cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5). Therefore, adding ω + ω⁴ gives:\n\n[cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)] + [cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)] = 2 cos(2π/5)\n\nSimilarly, z² + 1/z² = ω² + ω³. Let's compute that. ω² = cos(4π/5) + i sin(4π/5), and ω³ = cos(6π/5) + i sin(6π/5). But 6π/5 is equivalent to -4π/5, so ω³ = cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5). Therefore, adding ω² + ω³ gives:\n\n[cos(4π/5) + i sin(4π/5)] + [cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5)] = 2 cos(4π/5)\n\nSo the expression becomes 2 cos(2π/5) + 2 cos(4π/5). Let's compute this numerically to check if it's indeed -1.\n\nFirst, compute cos(2π/5). 2π/5 is 72 degrees. The cosine of 72 degrees is approximately 0.3090. Similarly, 4π/5 is 144 degrees, and cos(144 degrees) is approximately -0.8090. Therefore, 2 * 0.3090 + 2 * (-0.8090) = 0.618 - 1.618 = -1. So yes, this matches. Therefore, the expression equals -1. So that's another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometric identities, we can compute the sum 2 cos(2π/5) + 2 cos(4π/5). Let's note that cos(4π/5) = cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5). Similarly, cos(2π/5) is just cos(2π/5). So the expression becomes 2 cos(2π/5) - 2 cos(π/5). Let's compute this exactly.\n\nWe know that cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, let me recall the exact value. cos(π/5) is (1 + √5)/4 multiplied by 2? Wait, actually, cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Let me recall that cos(36°) = cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, no, more accurately:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let me check:\n\nWe know that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let's compute it. Let’s use the identity that in a regular pentagon, cos(72°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps it's better to use exact values.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal over the side is the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2. Using this, we can derive the exact values.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the identity that cos(72°) = 2 cos²(36°) - 1. Let’s let x = cos(36°), then cos(72°) = 2x² - 1. Also, from the double angle formula, cos(72°) = 2 cos²(36°) - 1. Then, we can solve for x.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's just compute 2 cos(2π/5) + 2 cos(4π/5) exactly.\n\nUsing known exact values:\n\ncos(2π/5) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, let me check a reference. From trigonometric exact values, cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let's compute:\n\ncos(36°) = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/2 * 1/2 * 2? Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact expression.\n\nActually, cos(36°) is equal to (1 + √5)/4 multiplied by 2. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the cosine of 36 degrees can be derived using the golden ratio. The exact value is cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let me compute:\n\nLet’s consider a regular pentagon. The central angles are 72°, so the angle from the center to two adjacent vertices is 72°. If we draw a triangle from the center to two adjacent vertices, the angle at the center is 72°, and the two sides are radii of the circumscribed circle. By bisecting this angle, we create two right triangles with angles 36°, 54°, and 90°.\n\nBut perhaps this is not helpful. Alternatively, using the identity for cos(36°):\n\nLet’s let θ = 36°, then 2θ = 72°, and 3θ = 108°, which is supplementary to 72°. So, cos(3θ) = -cos(72°). Using the multiple-angle formulas:\n\ncos(3θ) = 4 cos³θ - 3 cosθ\n\nSo, cos(108°) = 4 cos³(36°) - 3 cos(36°)\n\nBut cos(108°) = -cos(72°), so:\n\n- cos(72°) = 4 cos³(36°) - 3 cos(36°)\n\nBut cos(72°) = 2 cos²(36°) - 1 from the double-angle identity. Let me substitute:\n\n- (2 cos²(36°) - 1) = 4 cos³(36°) - 3 cos(36°)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n-2 cos²(36°) + 1 = 4 cos³(36°) - 3 cos(36°)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n4 cos³(36°) - 3 cos(36°) + 2 cos²(36°) - 1 = 0\n\nLet’s let x = cos(36°). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n4x³ - 3x + 2x² - 1 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n4x³ + 2x² - 3x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation. Let's try to factor it. Maybe using rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.\n\nTest x=1: 4 + 2 - 3 - 1 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nTest x=-1: -4 + 2 + 3 -1 = 0. So x=-1 is a root.", "answer": "-1"}

Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when subtracting numbers in a different base, it's helpful to convert them to base 10, do the subtraction there, and then convert back to the original base. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with converting 58 base 9 to base 10. In base 9, the rightmost digit is the ones place (9^0), and the next one is the nines place (9^1). So, 58 base 9 would be 5 * 9^1 + 8 * 9^0. Calculating that, 5 times 9 is 45, and 8 times 1 is 8. Adding those together gives 45 + 8 = 53. So, 58 base 9 is 53 in base 10.\n\nNow, converting 18 base 9 to base 10. Similarly, the rightmost digit is 8 * 9^0, which is 8, and the next digit is 1 * 9^1, which is 9. Adding those gives 9 + 8 = 17. So, 18 base 9 is 17 in base 10.\n\nNow, subtracting the two base 10 numbers: 53 - 17. Let's do that. 53 minus 10 is 43, and then minus 7 more would be 36. So, 53 - 17 = 36. Therefore, the result in base 10 is 36.\n\nNow, I need to convert 36 back to base 9. To do that, I can divide 36 by 9 and find the remainders. Let's see, 9 times 4 is 36, so 36 divided by 9 is 4 with a remainder of 0. So, the highest place value here is 9^1 * 4 + 9^0 * 0. So, that would be 40 base 9. Wait, but 40 in base 9 is 4*9 + 0 = 36 in base 10. That seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let's verify. If I have 4 in the nines place and 0 in the units place, that's indeed 4*9 + 0 = 36. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to convert both original numbers to base 10, subtract, and then convert back. Which I did, and got 36. Then 36 to base 9 is 40. So, the answer should be 40 base 9.\n\nWait, let me just make sure that 58 base 9 minus 18 base 9 is indeed 40 base 9. Maybe I can subtract them directly in base 9 without converting to base 10, just to confirm.\n\nIn base 9, the subtraction would be similar to how we do it in base 10, but if a digit in the minuend is smaller than the corresponding digit in the subtrahend, we have to borrow from the higher place value. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digits: 8 (base 9) minus 8 (base 9). 8 - 8 = 0. So, the rightmost digit is 0. Moving to the next digit: 5 (base 9) minus 1 (base 9). 5 - 1 = 4. So, the leftmost digit is 4. Therefore, the result is 40 base 9. Yep, same as before. So that's good. Both methods give the same result. So, the answer is 40 base 9.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. Converted both numbers to base 10, subtracted, converted back. Then did the subtraction directly in base 9, which gave the same result. Both methods confirm that the answer is 40 in base 9. So, I can be confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) is \\boxed{40_9}.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) and express the result in base 9, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10:**\n   - \\(58_9\\) in base 10:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 5 \\times 9 + 8 \\times 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\n     \\]\n   - \\(18_9\\) in base 10:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 1 \\times 9 + 8 \\times 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the base 10 equivalents:**\n   \\[\n   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the result back to base 9:**\n   - Divide 36 by 9:\n     \\[\n     36 \\div 9 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(36_{10}\\) is \\(40_9\\).\n\n4. **Verification by direct subtraction in base 9:**\n   - Subtract the rightmost digits: \\(8_9 - 8_9 = 0_9\\)\n   - Subtract the next digits: \\(5_9 - 1_9 = 4_9\\)\n   - Result: \\(40_9\\)\n\nThus, the result of \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) is \\(\\boxed{40_9}\\).", "answer": "40_9"}

Hmm, let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities. I know that \\(\\sec x\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\cos x\\), so \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). Maybe substituting that in will help.\n\nLet me rewrite the first term using that identity. So, \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\). Dividing by \\(\\sin x\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1/\\sin x\\), right? So that would be \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). Wait, no, hold on. If I have \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) divided by \\(\\sin x\\), that's \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\) which is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). So the first term simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n\nNow, the second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). I know that \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) is the definition of \\(\\tan x\\). So the second term is just \\(\\tan x\\).\n\nSo putting it all together, the original expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\tan x\\). Hmm, maybe I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine to combine them? Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's write \\(\\tan x\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). So the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Now, to combine these two terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). The common denominator would be \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\).\n\nSo, for the second term, \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), I can multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sin x\\) to get \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). So now, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nAh, \\(1 - \\sin^2 x\\) is one of the Pythagorean identities. That's equal to \\(\\cos^2 x\\). So substituting that in, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator and denominator, \\(\\cos^2 x\\) divided by \\(\\cos x\\) is \\(\\cos x\\). So that leaves us with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\) is the definition of \\(\\cot x\\). So the simplified form of the original expression is \\(\\cot x\\). Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Substitute \\(\\sec x\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\), so that becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). Then adjust the second term to have denominator \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\), which becomes \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). Subtract that from the first term: \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\), so \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\\). Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors here. So the simplified expression is \\(\\cot x\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\cot x}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), we start by using the identity \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). Substituting this into the first term, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nThe second term \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) is already in terms of sine and cosine. We rewrite the entire expression with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean identity \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\), we substitute and simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{\\cot x}\\).", "answer": "\\cot x"}

Maybe the original problem had some formatting with commas or periods that were lost in translation.

So, 10 persons + 6 squigs + 1 goolee. But how does this relate to the problem? Maybe this is an equation where 10 treeks plus some squigs and a goolee equals a certain weight, but since the problem only gives two equations, perhaps we need to derive the relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\n10 treeks = 2*(3 squigs) + 1 goolee.\n\nAnd 2 treeks + 1 goolee = 1 squig.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to work with that.\n\nAssuming:\n\nEquation 1: 10T = 6S + G (where T is treek, S is squig, G is goolee)\n\nEquation 2: 2T + G = S\n\nWe need to find how many treeks equal 1 squig, i.e., find x such that xT = S.\n\nSo, from equation 2: G = S - 2T\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: 10T = 6S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplify:\n\n10T = 7S - 2T\n\n10T + 2T = 7S\n\n12T = 7S\n\nTherefore, S = (12/7)T\n\nBut that would mean 1 squig is equal to 12/7 treeks, which is not possible if we're looking for whole numbers.

If the problem expects an integer answer, maybe my interpretation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first equation is 10T = 2*(3S) + G, and equation 2 is 2T + G = S.\n\nBut then solving:\n\nFrom equation 2: G = S - 2T\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: 10T = 6S + S - 2T => 10T = 7S - 2T => 12T = 7S => S = 12T/7\n\nStill fractional.

Then, once I find 'a' and 'b', I need to add them together to get the answer. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial has to be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then you combine like terms. So, maybe I should set up the multiplication step by step and then compare the coefficients of the resulting terms with the given product polynomial. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nLet me write down the two polynomials again:\n\nFirst polynomial: \\(3t^2 + 5t + a\\)\n\nSecond polynomial: \\(4t^2 + bt - 2\\)\n\nLet me denote the first polynomial as P(t) = 3t² + 5t + a and the second as Q(t) = 4t² + bt -2.\n\nSo, the product P(t) * Q(t) should equal 12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6. I need to find 'a' and 'b'.\n\nTo do this, I'll multiply P(t) and Q(t) using the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials here).\n\nLet me start by multiplying each term in P(t) by each term in Q(t):\n\nFirst, multiply 3t² by each term in Q(t):\n\n3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴\n\n3t² * bt = 3bt³\n\n3t² * (-2) = -6t²\n\nNext, multiply 5t by each term in Q(t):\n\n5t * 4t² = 20t³\n\n5t * bt = 5bt²\n\n5t * (-2) = -10t\n\nThen, multiply 'a' by each term in Q(t):\n\na * 4t² = 4a t²\n\na * bt = ab t\n\na * (-2) = -2a\n\nNow, let's collect all these terms together:\n\n12t⁴ + 3bt³ -6t² + 20t³ + 5bt² -10t + 4a t² + ab t -2a\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, the t⁴ term: only 12t⁴, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext, the t³ terms: 3bt³ + 20t³. So, that would be (3b + 20) t³.\n\nThen, the t² terms: -6t² + 5bt² + 4a t². Combining those gives (-6 + 5b + 4a) t².\n\nThe t terms: -10t + ab t. So, (-10 + ab) t.\n\nFinally, the constant term: -2a.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product polynomial is:\n\n12t⁴ + (3b + 20) t³ + (-6 + 5b + 4a) t² + (-10 + ab) t -2a\n\nNow, according to the problem, this should equal 12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding terms:\n\n1. Coefficient of t⁴: 12 = 12. That's already matching, so no problem here.\n\n2. Coefficient of t³: 3b + 20 = 26\n\n3. Coefficient of t²: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\n4. Coefficient of t: -10 + ab = -16\n\n5. Constant term: -2a = 6\n\nSo, we have five equations here, but some of them are redundant or can be solved independently. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the constant term: equation 5: -2a = 6. Solving for 'a' gives a = 6 / (-2) = -3. So, a = -3. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, moving to the coefficient of t: equation 4: -10 + ab = -16. Since we already found a = -3, we can substitute that into this equation to find 'b'.\n\nSo, substituting a = -3 into equation 4:\n\n-10 + (-3)b = -16\n\nSimplify:\n\n-10 -3b = -16\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n-3b = -16 + 10\n\n-3b = -6\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\nb = (-6)/(-3) = 2\n\nSo, b = 2. That's the value of 'b'.\n\nNow, let's check if these values of 'a' and 'b' satisfy the other equations.\n\nFirst, equation 2: 3b + 20 = 26. With b = 2:\n\n3*2 + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26. That's correct.\n\nEquation 3: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8. Substitute a = -3 and b = 2:\n\n-6 + 5*2 + 4*(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 = (-6 -12) +10 = -18 +10 = -8. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied with a = -3 and b = 2. Therefore, the answer is a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. The question asks for a + b. So, if a is -3 and b is 2, then -3 + 2 is indeed -1. Hmm.

The rate at which water is entering the tank is 20π cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at 4 meters per hour. I need to find the radius of the tank. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the tank is being filled, the volume is changing over time. The rate at which the volume changes (dV/dt) is given as 20π m³/h. At the same time, the rate at which the height of the water is increasing (dh/dt) is 4 m/h. \n\nSo, maybe I need to relate these two rates. I recall from calculus that the rate of change of the volume with respect to time is the derivative of the volume with respect to height times the rate of change of height with respect to time. In formula terms, that would be dV/dt = (dV/dh) * (dh/dt). \n\nLet me verify that. If V = πr²h, then dV/dh would be πr², since r is constant. So, dV/dt = πr² * dh/dt. That makes sense. So substituting the given values, 20π = πr² * 4. Then, I can solve for r.\n\nLet me write that out step by step:\n\nGiven:\ndV/dt = 20π m³/h\ndh/dt = 4 m/h\n\nWe know that:\ndV/dt = πr² * dh/dt\n\nSo plugging in the known values:\n20π = πr² * 4\n\nI can divide both sides by π to simplify:\n20 = r² * 4\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n20 / 4 = r²\n5 = r²\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\nr = √5\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I missed anything here. The problem mentions it's a cylindrical tank, so the formula V = πr²h applies. The rates are given, and since the radius is constant, the derivative makes sense. There's no mention of acceleration or anything, just a steady rate of filling. So, yeah, the calculation seems correct. \n\nBut let me think again. If the volume is increasing at 20π per hour and the height is increasing at 4 meters per hour, then the cross-sectional area (πr²) times the rate of height should give the volume rate. So, πr² * 4 = 20π. Dividing both sides by π gives 4r² = 20, so r² = 5, so r = √5. Yep, that's right. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The answer should be √5 meters. Let me just confirm the units. The volume rate is in m³/h, dh/dt is m/h. Multiplying πr² (which is area, m²) by m/h gives m³/h, which matches. So the units work out. \n\nTherefore, the radius of the tank is √5 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of the tank is \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}} meters.\n</think>\n\nGiven a cylindrical tank being filled with water at a rate of \\(20\\pi\\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rising at 4 meters per hour, we need to find the radius of the tank.\n\nFirst, recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height.

Let me try to understand the function first. It's piecewise defined: for x greater than or equal to 'a', the function is ax squared, and for x less than 'a', it's ax plus 2a. The variable 'a' is a number, and we need to find the maximum possible 'a' where this condition holds.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a horizontal line is of the form y = k, where k is a constant. The problem states that the graph of y = f(x) must intersect each horizontal line y = k at least once. So, for every possible k, there must be at least one x such that f(x) = k. Therefore, the function f(x) must cover all real numbers in its range. Wait, but actually, the range might not be all real numbers, but every horizontal line must intersect the graph, meaning that for every k, there exists some x where f(x) = k. So, it's not about the range being all real numbers, but rather that the function must be surjective, right? Because surjective means that every element in the codomain (which here is the real numbers) is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. So, yes, the function needs to be surjective.\n\nBut how does that relate to the value of 'a'? Let me think. The function is piecewise, so I need to analyze both pieces and ensure that together they cover all possible y-values.\n\nLet me first consider the two pieces of the function:\n\n1. For x ≥ a: f(x) = ax²\n2. For x < a: f(x) = ax + 2a\n\nSo, depending on the value of 'a', the shape of these two pieces will change. Let's consider different cases for 'a'. The problem is asking for the largest possible 'a', so maybe 'a' is positive? Because if 'a' is negative, the parabola ax² would open downward, and the linear part would have a negative slope. But let's see.\n\nFirst, let's note that when x approaches infinity, the function f(x) = ax² will go to positive infinity if a > 0, or negative infinity if a < 0. Similarly, when x approaches negative infinity (if x can be negative), the linear part f(x) = ax + 2a will go to negative infinity if a > 0, or positive infinity if a < 0. However, since the function is only defined for x < a in the linear part, if a is positive, then x can be any number less than a, so x can go to negative infinity. If a is negative, then x < a would only include x values less than a negative number, so x can't go to positive infinity. Therefore, the domain of the function is (-∞, a) ∪ [a, ∞). But since x can be any real number except between -∞ and a if a is positive? Wait, no. Wait, the domain is all real numbers except maybe at x = a? Wait, no. The function is defined for all real numbers: for x ≥ a, it's ax², and for x < a, it's ax + 2a. So, the domain is all real numbers. So, x can be any real number, split at x = a. So, x can be from -∞ to a, and from a to ∞. But depending on 'a', the behavior of each piece changes.\n\nNow, to ensure that every horizontal line y = k is intersected by the graph, we need that for every k, there exists some x such that f(x) = k. So, for each piece, we need to check if their ranges cover all possible k's. However, since they are two separate pieces, their ranges might overlap or not. If the union of their ranges covers all real numbers, then every horizontal line is intersected. But actually, even if their union doesn't cover all real numbers, but if for every k, at least one of the pieces can reach it, then it's okay.\n\nWait, actually, if one of the pieces can reach every k, then the other piece doesn't need to. But in reality, since the function is split into two parts, for each k, either the parabola part or the linear part (or both) must provide a solution. Therefore, we need that the union of the ranges of both pieces covers all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum 'a' such that the union of the ranges of ax² (for x ≥ a) and ax + 2a (for x < a) is all real numbers.\n\nSo, let's analyze each piece:\n\nFirst, the linear part: f(x) = ax + 2a for x < a. This is a straight line with slope a. If a > 0, then as x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches -∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, the range of the linear part is (-∞, a² + 2a).\n\nIf a < 0, then the slope is negative. As x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches +∞ (since a is negative, multiplying by x gives positive infinity), and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, the range of the linear part is (a² + 2a, +∞).\n\nNow, the quadratic part: f(x) = ax² for x ≥ a. If a > 0, since x ≥ a and a > 0, x is non-negative (if a is positive, x ≥ a is x ≥ a positive number). The quadratic function ax² is a parabola opening upwards (since a > 0). The minimum value of ax² is at x = 0, but since x ≥ a, the minimum value is at x = a, which is a*(a)^2 = a³. As x increases, ax² increases to infinity. Therefore, the range of the quadratic part is [a³, ∞).\n\nIf a < 0, the quadratic part is ax². Since a is negative, ax² is a downward-opening parabola. For x ≥ a, which, since a is negative, x ≥ a means x is greater than or equal to a negative number. So, x can be from a (negative) to infinity. The quadratic ax² will have its maximum at the vertex. The vertex of ax² is at x = 0. But since x ≥ a, which is negative, the maximum value of ax² is at x = a: a*(a)^2 = a³. Then, as x increases from a to infinity, ax² decreases because the parabola opens downward. Therefore, the range of the quadratic part when a < 0 is (-∞, a³].\n\nNow, combining both ranges:\n\nCase 1: a > 0\n\nLinear part range: (-∞, a² + 2a)\n\nQuadratic part range: [a³, ∞)\n\nUnion of these ranges: (-∞, a² + 2a) ∪ [a³, ∞)\n\nFor the union to cover all real numbers, there must be no gap between the two intervals. That is, the upper bound of the first interval (a² + 2a) must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the second interval (a³). So, we need:\n\na² + 2a ≥ a³\n\nRearranging:\n\na³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0\n\nFactor out an 'a':\n\na(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\na(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0\n\nSince a > 0 in this case, we can consider the factors for a > 0:\n\n(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0 / a\n\nBut since a > 0, the sign of the expression is determined by (a - 2)(a + 1). Since a + 1 > 0 for all a > 0, the inequality reduces to (a - 2) ≤ 0. Therefore, a ≤ 2.\n\nBut since a > 0, the possible values of a are 0 < a ≤ 2.\n\nBut we need the maximum a, so a = 2.\n\nWait, but let's check for a = 2.\n\nAt a = 2:\n\nLinear part range: (-∞, 2² + 2*2) = (-∞, 8)\n\nQuadratic part range: [2³, ∞) = [8, ∞)\n\nUnion: (-∞, 8) ∪ [8, ∞) = (-∞, ∞). So, combined, they cover all real numbers. So, a = 2 works.\n\nBut wait, if a is larger than 2, say a = 3:\n\nLinear part range: (-∞, 9 + 6) = (-∞, 15)\n\nQuadratic part range: [27, ∞)\n\nUnion: (-∞, 15) ∪ [27, ∞). There is a gap between 15 and 27, so not all real numbers are covered. Hence, a = 3 doesn't work.\n\nIf a is between 0 and 2, say a = 1:\n\nLinear part range: (-∞, 1 + 2) = (-∞, 3)\n\nQuadratic part range: [1, ∞)\n\nUnion: (-∞, 3) ∪ [1, ∞) = (-∞, ∞). So, works. But the maximum a is 2.\n\nWait, but when a approaches 2 from below, say a = 1.9:\n\nLinear part upper bound: (1.9)^2 + 2*(1.9) ≈ 3.61 + 3.8 = 7.41\n\nQuadratic part lower bound: (1.9)^3 ≈ 6.859\n\nSo, union would be (-∞, 7.41) ∪ [6.859, ∞). There's a gap between 6.859 and 7.41. Wait, but 7.41 is greater than 6.859, so actually, the upper bound of the linear part is 7.41, and the lower bound of the quadratic part is 6.859. So, the union would be (-∞, 7.41) ∪ [6.859, ∞), which leaves a gap between 6.859 and 7.41. Wait, but 7.41 is greater than 6.859, so actually, the union is (-∞, 7.41) and [6.859, ∞), which actually covers everything except between 6.859 and 7.41. Wait, no: 7.41 is part of (-∞, 7.41), so the union is (-∞, 7.41) combined with [6.859, ∞). So, the gap is between 6.859 and 7.41. But 6.859 is approximately 6.86, and 7.41 is approximately 7.41. So, between 6.86 and 7.41, there is no coverage. Therefore, the union does not cover all real numbers. So, even for a = 1.9, which is less than 2, the union leaves a gap. Therefore, only when a = 2, the upper bound of the linear part and the lower bound of the quadratic part coincide, making the gap disappear.\n\nSo, when a = 2:\n\nLinear part upper bound: 2² + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nQuadratic part lower bound: 2³ = 8\n\nThus, the union is (-∞, 8) ∪ [8, ∞) = (-∞, ∞). Perfect, no gap.\n\nHence, for a > 2, the gap remains, but for a = 2, it's covered. So, a = 2 is the maximum value where the union of the ranges covers all real numbers.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects each horizontal line at least once\". So, if a = 2 works, but a > 2 does not, then 2 is the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut let's check for a < 0.\n\nCase 2: a < 0\n\nLinear part range: (a² + 2a, +∞)\n\nQuadratic part range: (-∞, a³]\n\nUnion of these ranges: (-∞, a³] ∪ (a² + 2a, +∞)\n\nFor the union to cover all real numbers, there must be no gap between the two intervals. Therefore, the upper bound of the first interval (a³) must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the second interval (a² + 2a). So:\n\na³ ≥ a² + 2a\n\nRearranging:\n\na³ - a² - 2a ≥ 0\n\nFactor out an 'a':\n\na(a² - a - 2) ≥ 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\na(a - 2)(a + 1) ≥ 0\n\nSince a < 0 in this case, let's consider the factors:\n\na is negative, (a - 2) is negative (since a < 0 < 2), and (a + 1) can be positive or negative depending on a.\n\nSo, let's analyze the sign of the expression a(a - 2)(a + 1):\n\nSince a < 0, (a - 2) is negative, (a + 1) can be positive or negative.\n\nCase 2.1: a + 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ -1\n\nBut since a < 0, this is -1 ≤ a < 0.\n\nIn this interval, a is negative, (a - 2) is negative, (a + 1) is non-negative.\n\nMultiply the signs: negative * negative * non-negative = positive * non-negative = non-negative.\n\nTherefore, the expression is non-negative in -1 ≤ a < 0.\n\nCase 2.2: a + 1 < 0 ⇒ a < -1\n\nHere, a is negative, (a - 2) is negative, (a + 1) is negative.\n\nMultiply the signs: negative * negative * negative = positive * negative = negative.\n\nTherefore, the expression is negative in a < -1.\n\nTherefore, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≥ 0 holds when -1 ≤ a < 0.\n\nBut since we are in the case a < 0, the solution here is -1 ≤ a < 0.\n\nSo, for a between -1 and 0, the", "answer": "2"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling the standard form of a circle's equation. I think it's (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. Right, so the given equation isn't in that form, so I probably need to complete the squares for both the x and y terms to convert it into the standard form. \n\nLet me try that. Starting with the x terms: x² - 10x. To complete the square here, I take the coefficient of x, which is -10, divide it by 2 to get -5, and then square it to get 25. So, x² - 10x can be written as (x - 5)² - 25. Wait, let me check that: (x - 5)² is x² - 10x + 25, so subtracting 25 gives x² -10x. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow for the y terms: y² + 6y. Similarly, the coefficient of y is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, square it to get 9. So y² + 6y can be written as (y + 3)² - 9. Because (y + 3)² is y² + 6y + 9, so subtract 9 to get back to y² +6y. Correct.\n\nSo substituting these back into the original equation: (x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 3)² - 9 + c = 0. Combine the constants: -25 -9 + c = -34 + c. So the equation becomes (x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = 34 - c. \n\nNow, the standard form is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r². Comparing, the radius squared is 34 - c. The problem states that the radius is 1, so r² should be 1² = 1. Therefore, 34 - c = 1. Solving for c: 34 - c = 1 => -c = 1 -34 => -c = -33 => c = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If c is 33, then the right-hand side becomes 34 -33 =1, which is equal to r²=1, so the radius is indeed 1. That seems right. \n\nBut let me verify once again step by step. Original equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c=0. Completing the square for x: (x² -10x +25) -25 = (x-5)^2 -25. For y: (y² +6y +9) -9 = (y+3)^2 -9. Substitute back into equation: (x-5)^2 -25 + (y+3)^2 -9 +c=0. Combine constants: -25 -9 +c= -34 +c. So equation is (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 -c. Therefore, radius squared is 34 -c. Set equal to 1: 34 -c=1 => c=34-1=33. Yep, that's correct. So c must be 33.\n\nI think that's it. Just making sure there are no arithmetic errors. 25 from x terms, 9 from y terms, total subtracted is 34. So 34 -c =1, so c=33.

Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n34 - c = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = 34 - 1 = 33\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( c \\) is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).", "answer": "33"}

The function f is defined as f(x) = λx(1 - x). Alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a quadratic function f(x) = λx(1 - x). For certain values of λ, there should be some x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So we need to find all such λ where this condition holds. \n\nI know that fixed points of the function f are solutions to f(x) = x. So if x is a fixed point, then f(x) = x. But the problem is asking for points x where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. These are points that are part of a 2-cycle. So essentially, we need to find λ where the function has a 2-cycle but no fixed points (or maybe fixed points as well, but the question is specifically about points where f(x) ≠ x). Wait, but the problem says \"exists a x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x\". So it's okay if there are fixed points as long as there's at least one non-fixed point that forms a 2-cycle. Hmm, but actually, if there's a fixed point, then applying f twice would also give x, so such x would satisfy both f(x) = x and f(f(x)) = x. Therefore, the problem is specifically looking for λ where there exists a 2-cycle, i.e., points that are not fixed points but return to themselves after two iterations. So we need to find λ where there are 2-cycles but no fixed points? Or perhaps even with fixed points, but there exists a non-fixed point that forms a 2-cycle. Wait, but fixed points trivially satisfy f(f(x)) = x, so the problem is asking for the existence of at least one x where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. So even if there are fixed points, as long as there's another point that is part of a 2-cycle, then λ would be included. So maybe the answer is the range of λ where the function has a 2-cycle, regardless of fixed points. But I need to check.\n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points of the function. Fixed points satisfy f(x) = x. So:\n\nλx(1 - x) = x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nλx(1 - x) - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx[λ(1 - x) - 1] = 0\n\nSo the solutions are x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0. Let's solve the second equation:\n\nλ(1 - x) - 1 = 0 => λ - λx - 1 = 0 => λx = λ - 1 => x = (λ - 1)/λ\n\nBut x must be in [0,1]. So (λ - 1)/λ must be in [0,1]. Let's check when that's true.\n\n(λ - 1)/λ ≥ 0. Since λ is in [0,4], λ can be 0, but if λ = 0, then the function f(x) = 0, which is a constant function. Then fixed points would be all x in [0,1], since f(x) = 0 = x only if x = 0. But λ is in [0,4], so let's consider λ ≠ 0.\n\nFor λ > 0, (λ - 1)/λ ≥ 0 when λ - 1 ≥ 0 => λ ≥ 1. Similarly, (λ - 1)/λ ≤ 1 when λ - 1 ≤ λ => -1 ≤ 0, which is always true. So x = (λ - 1)/λ is in [0,1] only when λ ≥ 1. So fixed points other than x=0 exist only when λ ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, for λ in [0,1), the only fixed point is x=0. For λ in [1,4], there are two fixed points: x=0 and x=(λ - 1)/λ.\n\nBut the problem is about points x where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. So even for λ in [0,1), where the only fixed point is x=0, there might be other points x ≠ 0 such that f(f(x)) = x. So we need to check for all λ in [0,4], whether there exists x ≠ f(x) such that f(f(x)) = x.\n\nSo perhaps first, let's compute f(f(x)) and set it equal to x, then solve for x, and find the λ for which there exists a solution x ≠ fixed points.\n\nLet's compute f(f(x)):\n\nf(x) = λx(1 - x)\n\nThen f(f(x)) = λ * f(x) * (1 - f(x)) = λ [λx(1 - x)] [1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nSo f(f(x)) = λ² x(1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nWe need to set this equal to x:\n\nλ² x(1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] = x\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\nλ² x(1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ λ² (1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] - 1 ] = 0\n\nSo the solutions are x = 0 or the expression in the brackets is zero. Let's focus on the non-trivial solutions where x ≠ 0.\n\nSo we have:\n\nλ² (1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] - 1 = 0\n\nLet me expand this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the term inside the brackets: [1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nLet me expand λx(1 - x):\n\nλx(1 - x) = λx - λx²\n\nTherefore, 1 - λx(1 - x) = 1 - λx + λx²\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0\n\nLet me multiply out the terms:\n\nFirst, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):\n\nMultiply 1 by each term: 1*(1 - λx + λx²) = 1 - λx + λx²\n\nMultiply -x by each term: -x*(1 - λx + λx²) = -x + λx² - λx³\n\nCombine these:\n\n1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - (λx + x) + (λx² + λx²) - λx³\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx² - λx³\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² [1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx² - λx³] - 1 = 0\n\nNow distribute the λ²:\n\nλ² - λ²x(λ + 1) + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + λ² - 1 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0\n\nSimplify the last term:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - λ² + 1 = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's recall that we are looking for solutions x ≠ 0, so perhaps we can divide the equation by x? Wait, but x=0 is already a solution. Let's check if x=0 is a solution here. Plugging x=0 into the equation:\n\nλ³*0 - 2λ³*0 + λ²(λ + 1)*0 - λ² + 1 = -λ² + 1 = 0 => λ² = 1 => λ = 1 or -1. But λ is in [0,4], so λ=1. So when λ=1, x=0 is a solution, but we already know that for λ=1, x=0 is a fixed point. So maybe the non-trivial solutions come from this equation.\n\nBut perhaps instead of expanding the entire equation, which seems messy, let's think differently. Since we want f(f(x)) = x, which is a 2-cycle condition. For quadratic maps like this, the 2-cycles can be found by solving f(f(x)) = x, excluding the fixed points. So maybe we can subtract the fixed point equation from this.\n\nAlternatively, note that if x is a fixed point, then f(f(x)) = f(x) = x, so fixed points automatically satisfy f(f(x)) = x. Therefore, the solutions to f(f(x)) = x are the fixed points and the points of 2-cycles. But the problem wants points where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x, so we need to find the 2-cycles. Therefore, the values of λ for which there are 2-cycles. \n\nAlternatively, the 2-cycles correspond to solutions of f(f(x)) = x that are not fixed points. So, to find such λ, we can solve f(f(x)) = x, and then exclude the fixed points, then find the λ for which there are solutions remaining.\n\nSo let's proceed. Let's set f(f(x)) = x, which gives us the equation we derived earlier. Then, as we saw, this equation factors into x times something. So the non-trivial solutions come from the equation:\n\nλ² (1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] - 1 = 0\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle this. Let's consider substituting y = f(x). Then f(f(x)) = f(y) = x. So we have y = f(x) and x = f(y). So we have the system:\n\ny = λx(1 - x)\n\nx = λy(1 - y)\n\nSo substituting y from the first equation into the second:\n\nx = λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So perhaps solving this system could give us the 2-cycles.\n\nAlternatively, let's subtract the two equations. Since y = λx(1 - x) and x = λy(1 - y), we can substitute y from the first into the second:\n\nx = λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So perhaps the way to go is to solve this equation for x, given λ, and find for which λ there are solutions x ≠ fixed points.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the composition f(f(x)) - x = 0 and factor out the fixed points. Let me try that.\n\nWe have f(f(x)) - x = 0. We already know that x=0 is a solution. Let's check x=(λ - 1)/λ when λ ≥1. Let's see if these fixed points satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = x. Well, since they are fixed points, f(f(x)) = f(x) = x, so yes, they are solutions. So we need to find other solutions.\n\nSo, the equation f(f(x)) - x = 0 can be written as (x)(quadratic term) = 0, so x=0 and the quadratic equation. Therefore, the non-trivial solutions come from the quadratic equation. Let me check.\n\nWait, when we set f(f(x)) = x, we had:\n\nλ² x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0\n\nWhich factors as x [ λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 ] = 0\n\nSo, the non-trivial solutions come from:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0\n\nWait, expanding that again. Let me try to expand step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):\n\n= 1*(1 - λx + λx²) - x*(1 - λx + λx²)\n\n= 1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 1 - (λx + x) + (λx² + λx²) - λx³\n\n= 1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx² - λx³\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² [1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx² - λx³] - 1 = 0\n\nMultiply through:\n\nλ² - λ²x(λ + 1) + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation in x. Solving cubic equations is a bit involved, but maybe we can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the fixed points, x=0 and x=(λ - 1)/λ (when λ ≥1) are solutions. Let's check if these are roots of the cubic equation.\n\nFirst, check x=0:\n\nPlug x=0 into the cubic equation:\n\n0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -λ² + 1 = 0 => λ² = 1 => λ=1. So x=0 is a root only when λ=1. But when λ=1, x=0 is a fixed point, as we saw earlier.\n\nCheck x=(λ - 1)/λ for λ ≥1:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: λ³x³ = λ³ * [(λ - 1)/λ]^3 = λ³ *", "answer": "(3,4]"}

So it's a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are combinations of products of cosines and sines of different angles. The question is asking for the smallest positive θ where this ratio holds. Since tan θ is given, θ could be in the first or third quadrant, but since we want the smallest positive angle, it's likely in the first quadrant.\n\nBut first, maybe I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator. Let me look for trigonometric identities that can help here.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 5^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ + \\cos 35^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ - (\\sin 5^\\circ \\sin 20^\\circ + \\sin 35^\\circ \\sin 50^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nWait, the numerator has two products of cosines and then subtracting two products of sines. Similarly, the denominator has terms like sin a cos b, subtract sin b cos a, etc. Maybe these can be related to sum and difference formulas?\n\nRecall that the cosine of a difference is cos A cos B + sin A sin B, and the cosine of a sum is cos A cos B - sin A sin B. Similarly, sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B, and sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.\n\nLooking at the numerator: The first two terms are cos5 cos20 and cos35 cos50. Then subtracting sin5 sin20 and sin35 sin50. Let me group the terms:\n\n[cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20] + [cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50]\n\nAh! Each of these brackets is in the form of cos(A + B). Because cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. So:\n\ncos(5° + 20°) + cos(35° + 50°) = cos25° + cos85°\n\nSimilarly, the denominator is:\n\nsin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n(sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50)\n\nEach of these parentheses is in the form of sin(A + B). Because sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So:\n\nsin(5° + 20°) - sin(35° + 50°) = sin25° - sin85°\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\cos25^\\circ + \\cos85^\\circ}{\\sin25^\\circ - \\sin85^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that's a bit simpler. Now, let's see if we can simplify the numerator and denominator further.\n\nStarting with the numerator: cos25° + cos85°. There's a formula for the sum of cosines:\n\ncos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] cos[(A - B)/2]\n\nSo applying that:\n\n2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°)\n\nBut cos(-30°) = cos30°, so:\n\n2 cos55° cos30°\n\nSimilarly, the denominator: sin25° - sin85°. The formula for the difference of sines is:\n\nsin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nApplying that:\n\n2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°)\n\nBut sin(-30°) = -sin30°, so:\n\n2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°\n\nTherefore, putting numerator and denominator together:\n\nNumerator: 2 cos55° cos30°\n\nDenominator: -2 cos55° sin30°\n\nSo the fraction becomes:\n\n[2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]\n\nThe 2 and -2 cancel to -1, cos55° cancels out (since they are multiplied in numerator and denominator):\n\n- cos30° / sin30°\n\nWhich is equal to -cot30°, since cotangent is cosine over sine.\n\nBut cot30° is 1/tan30°, and tan30° is 1/√3, so cot30° is √3. Therefore:\n\n-√3\n\nTherefore, tanθ = -√3\n\nNow, tanθ = -√3. We need to find the smallest positive angle θ where this is true. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. The reference angle for tanθ = √3 is 60°, so the angles where tanθ = -√3 are 180° - 60° = 120°, and 360° - 60° = 300°. Since we need the smallest positive angle, 120° is smaller than 300°, so θ = 120°.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50\n\nGrouped as [cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20] + [cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50] = cos(5+20) + cos(35+50) = cos25 + cos85. Correct.\n\nDenominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50\n\nRearranged as [sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20] - [sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50] = sin(5+20) - sin(35+50) = sin25 - sin85. Correct.\n\nThen numerator simplified to 2 cos55 cos30, denominator simplified to -2 cos55 sin30. Then cancelling terms gives -cos30 / sin30 = -cot30 = -√3. So tanθ = -√3. The angles where tanθ = -√3 are 120° and 300°, so the smallest positive angle is 120°. Therefore, θ = 120°.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the smallest positive angle\". But 120° is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative. Is this correct? Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, tanθ = -√3. The general solution is θ = 180° + 60°, but since we want positive angles, the smallest positive solution is 180° - 60° = 120°, yes. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120°, so θ = 120°, so the measure is 120 degrees.\n\nBut let me just double-check the simplification steps because sometimes when dealing with trigonometric identities, mistakes can happen.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\ncos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50\n\nGrouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50). Each of these is cos(5+20) and cos(35+50), which is cos25 and cos85. Correct.\n\nDenominator:\n\nsin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50\n\nGrouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin(25) - sin(85). Correct.\n\nSo numerator: cos25 + cos85. Then using sum to product: 2 cos55 cos30. Denominator: sin25 - sin85 = -2 cos55 sin30. So ratio is [2 cos55 cos30]/[-2 cos55 sin30] = -cos30/sin30 = -cot30 = -√3. Therefore, tanθ = -√3, so θ = 120°, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120 degrees. Let me check if there's any miscalculation here. Wait, cos30° is √3/2 and sin30° is 1/2, so cos30/sin30 is (√3/2)/(1/2) = √3. Therefore, -cot30 is -√3. So tanθ = -√3. Therefore, θ is in the second quadrant, 180° - 60° = 120°, which is the smallest positive angle. So yes, 120° is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120 degrees.

{"original_question": "Determine o número de maneiras de arranjar as letras da palavra ELLIPSE.", "question": "Determine o número de maneiras de arranjar as letras da palavra ELLIPSE.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how many ways there are to arrange the letters in the word ELLIPSE. Hmm, first, I need to recall that when you have a word with repeated letters, the number of distinct arrangements is the factorial of the number of letters divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated letter. Is that right? Let me think. Yeah, I remember that formula. So for example, if all letters were unique, it would just be 8! because there are 8 letters. But since there are repeated letters here, we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me write down the word: ELLIPSE. Let's break down each letter: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So let's count how many times each letter repeats. The letter E appears twice, the letter L appears twice, and the rest (I, P, S) appear once each. So that's two pairs of repeated letters and three unique letters.\n\nSo applying the formula, the total number of arrangements should be 8! divided by (2! * 2!), right? Because there are two Ls and two Es. Let me check that. The formula is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!) where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2,... are the counts of each repeated item. So here, n is 8, and we have two groups of 2! for the Ls and Es. So yes, 8! / (2! * 2!). \n\nLet me compute that. First, 8! is 40320. Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 4. So 40320 divided by 4 is 10080. Wait, is that right? Let me verify. 8! is 40320. Dividing by 2*2=4 gives 40320/4=10080. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me double-check the word ELLIPSE.\n\nE, L, L, I, P, S, E. Let's list them:\n\n1. E\n2. L\n3. L\n4. I\n5. P\n6. S\n7. E\n\nSo letters E: positions 1 and 7. L: positions 2 and 3. The rest are unique. So yes, two Es and two Ls, and the rest are unique. So the formula should be 8!/(2! * 2!). Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 10080.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other letters that might have been missed. The word ELLIPSE has 8 letters. E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's 2 E's, 2 L's, and 1 each of I, P, S. So yes, total letters 2+2+1+1+1=7? Wait, no. Wait, 2 E's, 2 L's, and then I, P, S. That's 2 + 2 +1 +1 +1=7 letters? Wait, no. Wait, the word ELLIPSE is 8 letters. Let me count again:\n\n1. E\n2. L\n3. L\n4. I\n5. P\n6. S\n7. E\n8. [blank? No, the word ends at 7 letters. Wait, wait, ELLIPSE is 8 letters. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let's see: E (1), L (2), L (3), I (4), P (5), S (6), E (7), and then another letter? Wait, no. Wait, the word is ELLIPSE. Let's see: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. That's 7 letters. Wait, but the original word is 8 letters. Hmm. Wait, is that correct? Wait, ELLIPSE: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Wait, that's 7 letters. Wait, but maybe I missed a letter. Let me check the spelling. E-L-L-I-P-S-E. So E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's 7 letters. Wait, but the user wrote the word as ELLIPSE. Wait, is that 8 letters? Let me check again.\n\nWait, E (1), L (2), L (3), I (4), P (5), S (6), E (7). So seven letters. Wait, but maybe the original word is longer. Wait, no. Wait, ELLIPSE is the word. Let me check the number of letters. E is 1, then L is 2, L is 3, I is 4, P is 5, S is 6, E is 7. Wait, that's seven letters. Wait, but maybe it's ELLIPSE, which is E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So seven letters. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the original problem says \"Determine o número de maneiras de arraninar as letra da palavra ELLIPSE.\" So in Portuguese, \"_LLIPSE\" is ELLIPSE. Wait, but maybe in Portuguese, it's 8 letters. Wait, maybe I need to confirm the spelling.\n\nWait, ELLIPSE in Portuguese is the same as in English? Let me check. \"Ellipse\" is a word in Portuguese, right? So ELLIPSE would be E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's 7 letters. Wait, but maybe in Portuguese, it's spelled with an extra letter. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another word. Let me check. Wait, \"Ellipse\" is a geometric figure, which in Portuguese is \" oval \" or \" oblong \", but the spelling is E-L-L-I-P-S-E, which is 7 letters. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo? But the user wrote ELLIPSE. So perhaps it's 7 letters. Wait, but then why does the user write \"Determine o número de maneiras de arranivar as letra da palavra ELLIPSE.\" So maybe the original word is ELLIPSE with 7 letters. Wait, but in English, ELLIPSE is 7 letters. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement? Hmm. Wait, no. Let me check again. E (1), L (2), L (3), I (4), P (5), S (6), E (7). So seven letters. So the user wrote ELLIPSE as a 7-letter word. Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, maybe in Portuguese, \"LLIPSE\" is different. Wait, maybe the user confused with another language? Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem is correct, and ELLIPSE is 8 letters. Wait, let me check again. E, L, L, I, P, S, E. That's 7 letters. Wait, unless there's a space or something. Wait, no. The problem says \"as letra da palavra ELLIPSE\". So the word is ELLIPSE. Therefore, the letters are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So seven letters. Therefore, the total number of letters is 7. Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong because I assumed 8 letters. So that's a critical error.\n\nSo, correction: The word ELLIPSE has 7 letters. The letters are: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So two Es and two Ls, and the rest are unique. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! divided by (2! * 2!). So let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 7! is 5040. Then, 2! * 2! is 4. So 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So the number of distinct arrangements should be 1260.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm the number of letters again. If the word is ELLIPSE, then:\n\n1. E\n2. L\n3. L\n4. I\n5. P\n6. S\n7. E\n\nYes, seven letters. So that's correct. So the initial mistake was assuming 8 letters. Therefore, the correct calculation is 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 1260.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't skip any letters. Let me write down each letter:\n\n- E: appears twice\n- L: appears twice\n- I: once\n- P: once\n- S: once\n\nYes, that's correct. So two pairs of repeated letters. Therefore, the formula is 7! / (2! * 2!) = 1260. So the answer is 1260.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me check another way. Suppose we have seven positions to fill with the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Let's think of arranging them. First, if all letters were unique, it would be 7! = 5040. But since there are duplicates, we have to divide by the factorial of the number of duplicates. For the two Es, there are 2! ways they can be arranged among themselves, which we consider identical. Similarly, the two Ls can be arranged in 2! ways, which are also identical. Therefore, we divide by 2! * 2! to account for these indistinguishable arrangements. So indeed, 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct arrangements is 1260.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is \\boxed{1260}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE, we start by noting the letters and their frequencies: E appears twice, L appears twice, and I, P, S each appear once. The word consists of 7 letters in total.\n\nThe formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of letters, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of each repeated letter. For the word ELLIPSE, we have:\n\n\\[\nn = 7, \\quad n_1 = 2 \\text{ (for E)}, \\quad n_2 = 2 \\text{ (for L)}\n\\]\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 2!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n\\[\n7! = 5040, \\quad 2! = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct permutations is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5040}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is \\(\\boxed{1260}\\).", "answer": "1260"}

Hmm, factorials can get really big, and trailing zeros depend on how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial, right? Since 10 is 2 times 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nBut wait, I remember that in any factorial, there are usually more 2s than 5s. So, maybe the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!? Let me check that. \n\nYes, because there are more even numbers contributing factors of 2 than multiples of 5. So, the number of 5s will be the limiting factor. Therefore, I need to calculate how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. \n\nHow do I do that? I think there's a formula for finding the exponent of a prime in a factorial. It's the sum of the floor division of n by p, plus the floor division of n by p squared, and so on, until p to the power exceeds n. \n\nSo, for 42! and prime 5, it should be floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ... \n\nLet me compute each term. First term: floor(42/5). 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so the floor is 8. \n\nSecond term: floor(42/25). 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so the floor is 1. \n\nNext term: floor(42/125). 125 is 5 cubed, which is 125. 42 divided by 125 is 0.336, so floor is 0. \n\nSince higher powers will also result in 0, we can stop here. \n\nAdding them up: 8 + 1 + 0 = 9. \n\nTherefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each term again. \n\nFirst term: 42 divided by 5. 5 times 8 is 40, which is less than 42, and 5 times 9 is 45, which is more than 42. So yes, floor(42/5) is 8. \n\nSecond term: 42 divided by 25. 25 times 1 is 25, 25 times 2 is 50, which is more than 42. So floor(42/25) is 1. \n\nThird term: 42 divided by 125. 125 is already larger than 42, so floor(42/125) is 0. \n\nSo total number of 5s is 8 + 1 = 9. Since there are more 2s, the number of trailing zeros should be 9. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I should check with a smaller factorial to see if the formula works. Let's take 10! for example. \n\n10! is 3628800, which has two trailing zeros. Using the formula: floor(10/5) + floor(10/25) = 2 + 0 = 2. Correct. So that works. \n\nAnother example: 25!. The number of trailing zeros should be floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6. Let me check 25! calculation. 25! is a huge number, but I know that it ends with 6 zeros. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nSo, applying the same logic, for 42! it's 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's list the multiples of 5 between 1 and 42. They are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. Then, numbers like 25, which is 5 squared, contributes an extra 5. So that's one more. So total 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nYes, that's the same as before. So each multiple of 5 gives at least one 5, and multiples of higher powers of 5 give additional 5s. So 25 contributes two 5s, right? But in the factorial 42!, 25 is only counted once in the first term floor(42/5) = 8, but then in the second term floor(42/25) = 1, which adds an extra one. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 5s is 9, so the number of trailing zeros is 9. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just cross-verify once more. Maybe compute the number of 2s in 42! and see if it's more than 9. \n\nNumber of 2s would be floor(42/2) + floor(42/4) + floor(42/8) + floor(42/16) + floor(42/32) + ... \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nfloor(42/2) = 21\n\nfloor(42/4) = 10\n\nfloor(42/8) = 5\n\nfloor(42/16) = 2\n\nfloor(42/32) = 1\n\nfloor(42/64) = 0\n\nAdding them up: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39. \n\nSo there are 39 factors of 2 in 42!. Since there are 9 factors of 5, and each pair contributes a 10, the number of trailing zeros is indeed 9. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 9. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, maybe I can try to simplify the problem. The function looks symmetric in x and y to some extent. The terms are similar, with x multiplied by a square root involving y² and vice versa. Maybe there's a substitution or a trigonometric identity that can help here. Wait, since we have square roots of 1 minus squares, maybe using sine and cosine substitutions would be helpful? Because √(1 - sin²θ) is cosθ, right?\n\nLet me try that. Let me set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, where θ and φ are angles between -π/2 and π/2 since sine of those angles will give values between -1 and 1. Then, √(1 - x²) becomes cosθ and √(1 - y²) becomes cosφ. So substituting into the function f(x, y):\n\nf(x, y) = sinθ * cosφ + sinφ * cosθ\n\nOh! That simplifies to sin(θ + φ), because sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). Interesting. So the maximum value of sin(θ + φ) is 1, since the sine function has a maximum of 1. Therefore, the maximum of f(x, y) would be 1. But wait, we need to check if this is achievable given the constraints on x and y.\n\nSince x = sinθ and y = sinφ, θ and φ can be any real numbers such that x and y are between -1 and 1. But θ and φ themselves can be any angles. However, to get sin(θ + φ) = 1, we need θ + φ = π/2 + 2πk for some integer k. The principal solution is θ + φ = π/2. So if θ + φ = π/2, then θ = π/2 - φ. Let me check if this is possible. \n\nIf θ = π/2 - φ, then x = sinθ = sin(π/2 - φ) = cosφ, and y = sinφ. Therefore, x = cosφ and y = sinφ. Then, substituting back into the original variables, x = cosφ and y = sinφ. Let's verify this in the original function:\n\nf(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²)\n= cosφ * √(1 - sin²φ) + sinφ * √(1 - cos²φ)\n= cosφ * cosφ + sinφ * sinφ\n= cos²φ + sin²φ\n= 1\n\nYes, that works! So when x and y satisfy x = cosφ and y = sinφ for some φ, then f(x, y) = 1. Therefore, the maximum value is 1. But wait, is there a case where θ + φ could lead to a higher value? But sine of any angle doesn't exceed 1, so the maximum possible value is indeed 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use calculus here. Let me try taking partial derivatives to confirm. Let's compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve for critical points.\n\nFirst, f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²)\n\nCompute ∂f/∂x:\n\nThe derivative of x√(1 - y²) with respect to x is √(1 - y²). Then, the derivative of y√(1 - x²) with respect to x is y * (1/(2√(1 - x²))) * (-2x) = -xy / √(1 - x²). So:\n\n∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²)\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y:\n\nDerivative of x√(1 - y²) with respect to y is x * (1/(2√(1 - y²))) * (-2y) = -xy / √(1 - y²). Then, derivative of y√(1 - x²) with respect to y is √(1 - x²). So:\n\n∂f/∂y = √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²)\n\nSet both partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\n1) √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²) = 0\n2) √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²) = 0\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)\n\nMultiply both sides by √(1 - x²):\n\n√(1 - y²) * √(1 - x²) = xy\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\n√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)\n\nMultiply both sides by √(1 - y²):\n\n√(1 - x²) * √(1 - y²) = xy\n\nSo both equations reduce to the same equation: √(1 - x²) * √(1 - y²) = xy\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x²y²\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n1 - x² - y² + x²y² = x²y²\n\nSubtract x²y² from both sides:\n\n1 - x² - y² = 0\n\nSo,\n\nx² + y² = 1\n\nSo, the critical points occur when x² + y² = 1. Therefore, the maximum must occur on the unit circle x² + y² = 1. But we also need to check the boundaries, like when x or y is at -1 or 1, but since the function f(x, y) at x=1 would be 1 * √(1 - y²) + y * √(0) = √(1 - y²). The maximum of √(1 - y²) when y is between -1 and 1 is 1, achieved when y=0. Similarly for y=1. But in that case, the function would be 1, which is the same as the maximum we found earlier. Wait, but if x=1 and y=0, then f(1, 0) = 1 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 1. Similarly, if x=0 and y=1, f(0,1) = 0 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 1. So those points also give the maximum value of 1. So even on the boundary, the maximum is 1. \n\nBut wait, in the critical points, we have x² + y² = 1. So points on the unit circle. Let me check if all points on the unit circle give f(x, y) = 1. Wait, let's take a point on the unit circle, say x = cosθ, y = sinθ. Then f(x, y) = cosθ * √(1 - sin²θ) + sinθ * √(1 - cos²θ) = cosθ * cosθ + sinθ * sinθ = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1. So indeed, all points on the unit circle x² + y² = 1 satisfy f(x, y) = 1. Therefore, the maximum value is 1, achieved at all points on the unit circle and also at the corners (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), but wait, if x and y are both negative, then the terms would be negative. For example, at (-1, 0), f(-1, 0) = -1 * 1 + 0 * 0 = -1, which is the minimum. Similarly, (0, -1) gives -1. So the maximum is indeed 1, achieved at (1,0) and (0,1), as well as all other points where x² + y² =1. Wait, but earlier when I did the trigonometric substitution, I found that when x = cosφ and y = sinφ, which would be points on the unit circle. So yes, that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, in the critical points, we found that x² + y² =1. So all points on the unit circle are critical points, and all of them give f(x, y) =1. Therefore, the maximum is 1. So that's the answer. But let me just check another point that's not on the unit circle. For example, x = y = 1/√2. Then, f(1/√2, 1/√2) = (1/√2) * √(1 - 1/2) + (1/√2) * √(1 - 1/2) = (1/√2)*(√(1/2)) + (1/√2)*(√(1/2)) = (1/√2)*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even this point, which is on the unit circle (since (1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 +1/2 =1), gives f(x,y)=1. So yes, all points on the unit circle work, and they all give the maximum value of 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a point inside the domain where f(x, y) is larger than 1? Let me test x = y = 1. Then f(1,1) is 1*0 +1*0=0. Not good. What about x = y = 0? Then f(0,0)=0. Not helpful. How about x = y = 0.5? Then f(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5*√(1 -0.25) +0.5*√(1 -0.25)=0.5*(√0.75)+0.5*(√0.75)=√0.75 ≈0.866, which is less than 1. So indeed, the maximum seems to be 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1, achieved when x² + y² =1. Therefore, the answer is 1. But wait, just to make sure, let me check another point on the unit circle. Let's say x = 0.6, y = 0.8. Then x² + y² = 0.36 + 0.64 =1. Then f(0.6, 0.8)=0.6*√(1 -0.64)+0.8*√(1 -0.36)=0.6*√0.36 +0.8*√0.64=0.6*0.6 +0.8*0.8=0.36 +0.64=1. Yep, that works. So regardless of the point on the unit circle, the function equals 1. So that's the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value of the function is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x, y) = x \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) where \\( -1 \\le x, y \\le 1 \\), we can use trigonometric substitutions and critical point analysis.\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( x = \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( y = \\sin \\phi \\). This transforms the function into:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi + \\sin \\phi \\cos \\theta = \\sin(\\theta + \\phi)\n\\]\nThe maximum value of \\( \\sin(\\theta + \\phi) \\) is 1. To achieve this, we need \\( \\theta + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Substituting back, we find \\( x = \\cos \\phi \\) and \\( y = \\sin \\phi \\), which satisfies \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\).\n\nNext, using calculus, we compute the partial derivatives of \\( f(x, y) \\) and set them to zero:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0\n\\]\nBoth equations reduce to \\( \\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = xy \\). Squaring both sides gives \\( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \\), leading to \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\).\n\nChecking points on the unit circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\), we find:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = x \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\nThus, all points on the unit circle yield \\( f(x, y) = 1 \\). Testing boundary values confirms that the maximum value is indeed 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "1"}

Hmm, let me recall how to do this. I think there's a formula involving the cross product of two vectors in a plane. Wait, right! The area of a triangle formed by two vectors is half the magnitude of their cross product. Let me make sure I remember correctly.\n\nFirst, the vectors OA and OB are given as three-dimensional vectors. OA is (1, 2, 3) and OB is (-3, -2, 1). Since both vectors start from the origin O, the triangle OAB is formed by these two vectors and the line segment AB. To find the area, the cross product method should work here because in 3D, even if the vectors are not in the same plane, the cross product's magnitude gives the area of the parallelogram they form, so half of that would be the area of the triangle.\n\nAlright, so let's compute the cross product of vectors OA and OB. The cross product formula in 3D is:\n\nOA × OB = |i (OA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y) - j (OA_x * OB_z - OA_z * OB_x) + k (OA_x * OB_y - OA_y * OB_x)|\n\nLet me write down the components of OA and OB first.\n\nOA = (1, 2, 3)\nOB = (-3, -2, 1)\n\nSo, OA_x = 1, OA_y = 2, OA_z = 3\nOB_x = -3, OB_y = -2, OB_z = 1\n\nNow, plugging into the cross product formula:\n\nFirst component (i):\nOA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y = 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSecond component (j):\nThis is subtracted, so we have -(OA_x * OB_z - OA_z * OB_x)\n= -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10\n\nThird component (k):\nOA_x * OB_y - OA_y * OB_x = 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4\n\nSo, OA × OB = (8, -10, 4)\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2)\n\nCalculating each term:\n8^2 = 64\n(-10)^2 = 100\n4^2 = 16\n\nSum: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180\n\nSo, |OA × OB| = sqrt(180) = sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5)\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle OAB is half of this, which is (6*sqrt(5))/2 = 3*sqrt(5)\n\nWait, let me check my cross product calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst component: 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That's correct.\n\nSecond component: -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.\n\nThird component: 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the cross product vector is (8, -10, 4). The magnitude squared is 64 + 100 + 16 = 180, so magnitude is sqrt(180) = 6*sqrt(5). Then half of that is 3*sqrt(5). That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using the formula for area with coordinates. Since O is the origin, A is (1,2,3), B is (-3,-2,1). The area can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) |OA × OB|\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember cross products, maybe I could project one vector onto the plane perpendicular to the other, but cross product is the standard method here.\n\nSo, after verifying the cross product components, I think the answer is 3 times the square root of 5.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of complex numbers and maybe use recurrence relations or trigonometric identities. \n\nFirst, the equation z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 looks familiar. The right-hand side is the golden ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter phi (φ). So φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. Interesting. Maybe there's a connection here with the roots of unity or some trigonometric expressions?\n\nWait, another approach: If I let z = e^(iθ), then 1/z = e^(-iθ), so z + 1/z = 2cosθ. Comparing that to the given equation, 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me check what angle θ satisfies this. \n\nBut maybe I should consider that z is a root of the equation z + 1/z = φ. Let's rearrange this equation:\n\nMultiply both sides by z: z^2 + 1 = φ z.\n\nThen, z^2 - φ z + 1 = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are z = [φ ± sqrt(φ^2 - 4)] / 2. Let's compute φ^2:\n\nφ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2.\n\nTherefore, φ^2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 8)/2 = (-5 + sqrt(5))/2. Hmm, which is negative since sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so -5 + 2.236 ≈ -2.764. So sqrt(φ^2 - 4) is imaginary. \n\nTherefore, the roots z are complex numbers:\n\nz = [φ ± i sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/2 ) ] / 2.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting into the algebra, I can use De Moivre's theorem. If z can be expressed in terms of cosine and sine, then z^n + 1/z^n can be written as 2cos(nθ). So maybe if I can find θ such that 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then z^n + 1/z^n = 2cos(nθ). \n\nWait, let's check that. If z = e^(iθ), then z + 1/z = 2cosθ. So given that 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me compute θ. \n\nBut cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me check what angle θ satisfies this. Alternatively, maybe there's a relation with the regular pentagon angles? Because the golden ratio is related to 36 degrees, which is 2π/10 or π/5 radians. Let's see:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, no. Wait, cos(36°) is actually (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2? Let me recall exact values. \n\nYes, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * 1/2 * 2? Wait, maybe I need to check exact value. \n\nFrom trigonometric identities, we know that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, let me compute it properly. \n\ncos(36°) is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 multiplied by 2. Wait, actually, exact value is [1 + sqrt(5)]/4 * 2? Let me check:\n\nWe know that cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, let's derive it. \n\nIn a regular pentagon, the cosine of 36 degrees can be found using the golden triangle. Alternatively, using the identity for cos(36°):\n\nLet θ = 36°, then 2θ = 72°, and 3θ = 108°, etc. But maybe using the double-angle formula. \n\nAlternatively, from the pentagon, we have cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, let's compute cos(36°):\n\nUsing the formula for cosine of 36 degrees:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, no. Let's compute it numerically:\n\nsqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809. And cos(36°) ≈ 0.8090, which matches. Therefore, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately 0.809/2 ≈ 0.4045, which is not. Wait, no. Wait, 0.809 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately 0.809/2 ≈ 0.4045. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me check exact value:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, let's compute cos(36°):\n\nFrom the pentagon, in a regular pentagon, the diagonal over the side is the golden ratio φ. Using that, we can derive that cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. But cos(36°) is approximately 0.8090, which is equal to φ/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809. So yes, cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no. φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2. So φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. But cos(36°) is φ/2. So cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no. Wait, φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, let's compute (1 + sqrt(5))/4:\n\n(1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809. So yes, (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, which is equal to cos(36°). Therefore, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 0.809 is φ/2. Since φ ≈ 1.618, so φ/2 ≈ 0.809. Therefore, cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no. φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Therefore, φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. But (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, which is indeed cos(36°). Therefore, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, but 0.809 is φ/2. So, φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Therefore, cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, but φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ/2 is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Therefore, cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. So yes, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Therefore, θ = 36°, so θ = π/5 radians. Because 36° is π/5 radians. \n\nSo if θ = π/5, then z = e^(iπ/5) or z = e^(-iπ/5). Therefore, z^n + 1/z^n = 2cos(nπ/5). So for n=1, it's 2cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which matches the given equation. Therefore, z is e^(iπ/5) or e^(-iπ/5). \n\nTherefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = 2cos(85π/5) = 2cos(17π). But 17π is equivalent to π (since cosine has period 2π, 17π = 8*2π + π). Therefore, cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = 2*(-1) = -2. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again:\n\nIf θ = π/5, then z = e^(iπ/5), so z^85 = e^(i85π/5) = e^(i17π). Since e^(i17π) = e^(i(16π + π)) = e^(i16π)*e^(iπ) = (e^(i2π))^8 * e^(iπ) = 1^8 * (-1) = -1. Similarly, 1/z^85 = e^(-i85π/5) = e^(-i17π) = e^(-i(16π + π)) = e^(-i16π)*e^(-iπ) = (e^(-i2π))^8 * e^(-iπ) = 1^8 * (-1) = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = -1 + (-1) = -2. \n\nAlternatively, using the cosine approach: 2cos(17π) = 2cos(π) = 2*(-1) = -2. \n\nBut let me check if 85π/5 is indeed 17π. 85 divided by 5 is 17. So yes, 85π/5 = 17π. Then, since cosine is periodic with period 2π, 17π = 8*2π + π. Therefore, cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is -2. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, since z satisfies the quadratic equation z^2 - φ z + 1 = 0, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for z^n + 1/z^n. Let me denote a_n = z^n + 1/z^n. Then, we can find a recurrence relation for a_n. \n\nWe know that a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\na_1 = z + 1/z = φ. \n\nNow, let's find a recurrence relation. For n ≥ 1, we can use the identity:\n\na_{n+1} = (z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1}) = (z^n + 1/z^n)(z + 1/z) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1})\n\nWhich is a standard linear recurrence relation for such sequences. So:\n\na_{n+1} = a_n * a_1 - a_{n-1}\n\nTherefore, since a_1 = φ and a_0 = 2, we can compute a_n using this recurrence. \n\nSo let's see if this works. Let's compute a_2:\n\na_2 = a_1 * a_1 - a_0 = φ^2 - 2. \n\nBut φ^2 = φ + 1 (since φ satisfies φ^2 = φ + 1). Therefore, a_2 = (φ + 1) - 2 = φ -1. \n\nSimilarly, a_3 = a_2 * a_1 - a_1 = (φ -1)φ - φ = φ^2 - φ - φ = φ^2 - 2φ. \n\nBut φ^2 = φ + 1, so a_3 = (φ +1) - 2φ = -φ +1. \n\na_4 = a_3 * a_1 - a_2 = (-φ +1)φ - (φ -1) = (-φ^2 + φ) - φ +1 = (-φ -1 + φ) - φ +1 = (-1) - φ +1 = -φ. \n\na_5 = a_4 * a_1 - a_3 = (-φ)(φ) - (-φ +1) = -φ^2 + φ -1. \n\nAgain, φ^2 = φ +1, so -φ^2 = -φ -1. Therefore, a_5 = (-φ -1) + φ -1 = -2. \n\na_6 = a_5 * a_1 - a_4 = (-2)φ - (-φ) = -2φ + φ = -φ. \n\na_7 = a_6 * a_1 - a_5 = (-φ)φ - (-2) = -φ^2 + 2 = -(φ +1) +2 = -φ -1 +2 = -φ +1. \n\na_8 = a_7 * a_1 - a_6 = (-φ +1)φ - (-φ) = (-φ^2 + φ) + φ = (-φ -1 + φ) = -1. \n\na_9 = a_8 * a_1 - a_7 = (-1)φ - (-φ +1) = -φ + φ -1 = -1. \n\na_10 = a_9 * a_1 - a_8 = (-1", "answer": "-2"}

There's a triangle ABC with medians AD, BE, and CF intersecting at the centroid G. Then there's a line passing through G that's parallel to BC, and this line intersects AB at point M and AC at point N. The area of triangle ABC is 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, alright.\n\nFirst, I remember that the centroid G divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since this line is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC should be similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem or something like that. Wait, the Basic Proportionality Theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. So, in this case, since MN is parallel to BC, AM/AB = AN/AC. But since ABC is a triangle, AB and AC are sides, so maybe the ratio is the same as the ratio of AM to AB and AN to AC.\n\nBut how does this help with the area? The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. If I can find the ratio of similarity between triangle AMN and ABC, then I can find the area of AMN and maybe subtract something to get ENG?\n\nWait, but ENG is not directly part of AMN. Let me think. Maybe I need to find coordinates for all these points to calculate the area. Coordinates might be a good approach here.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). Choosing even numbers here to make the centroid calculations simpler. The centroid G is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. So, G would be at ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ( (2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 ).\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to choose specific coordinates. Let me assume ABC is a triangle with coordinates A(0, 0), B(2, 0), C(0, 2). Then the area would be (2*2)/2 = 2, but the given area is 144. Maybe scaling up later. Wait, but maybe using coordinates with ABC having area 144 initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set coordinates such that ABC is a general triangle, and use variables. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s assign coordinates:\n\nLet’s let A be at (0, 0), B at (2b, 0), and C at (2c, 2d). Then the area of ABC is given by the determinant formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (2b)(2d) - (2c)(0) | = (1/2)(4bd) = 2bd. Since the area is 144, 2bd = 144 => bd = 72. So that's a relation between b and d.\n\nNow, the medians AD, BE, and CF. Let's find the coordinates of the midpoints.\n\nMidpoint D of BC: coordinates ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)\n\nMidpoint E of AC: coordinates ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)\n\nMidpoint F of AB: coordinates ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)\n\nSo the medians are:\n\nAD: from A(0,0) to D(b + c, d)\n\nBE: from B(2b,0) to E(c, d)\n\nCF: from C(2c, 2d) to F(b, 0)\n\nNow, the centroid G is the intersection point of the medians. The centroid's coordinates are the average of the vertices:\n\nG_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3\n\nG_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3\n\nSo G is at ( (2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 )\n\nNow, the line passing through G and parallel to BC. Let's find the equation of BC first.\n\nPoints B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b)\n\nTherefore, the line MN, which is parallel to BC and passes through G, will have the same slope d/(c - b). Let's write the equation of line MN.\n\nUsing point-slope form:\n\ny - G_y = [d/(c - b)](x - G_x)\n\nSo,\n\ny - (2d/3) = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3 )\n\nWe need to find where this line intersects AB and AC.\n\nFirst, let's find intersection point M on AB.\n\nAB is from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0). So AB is along the x-axis. The equation of AB is y = 0.\n\nSo substitute y = 0 into the equation of MN:\n\n0 - (2d/3) = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (c - b)/d:\n\n(-2d/3) * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nThen,\n\nx = -2(c - b)/3 + (2b + 2c)/3\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx = [ -2c + 2b + 2b + 2c ] / 3\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(-2c + 2c) + (2b + 2b) = 0 + 4b = 4b\n\nSo x = 4b/3\n\nTherefore, point M is at (4b/3, 0)\n\nSimilarly, find intersection point N on AC.\n\nAC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). The equation of AC can be parameterized. Let's find its equation.\n\nThe slope of AC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 0) = d/c. So equation is y = (d/c)x.\n\nNow, find intersection of line MN with AC. So set y = (d/c)x into the equation of MN.\n\nFrom MN's equation:\n\ny - (2d/3) = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3 )\n\nSubstitute y = (d/c)x:\n\n(d/c)x - (2d/3) = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (c - b)/d to eliminate denominators:\n\n[(d/c)x - (2d/3)] * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n[ (x/c - 2/3 ) ] * (c - b) = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nExpand left side:\n\n(x/c)(c - b) - (2/3)(c - b) = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - (x b)/c - (2c)/3 + (2b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n- (x b)/c - (2c)/3 + (2b)/3 = - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-3(x b)/c - 2c + 2b = -2b - 2c\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3(x b)/c + 2b = -2b\n\nBring -2b to left:\n\n-3(x b)/c + 2b + 2b = 0\n\n-3(x b)/c + 4b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb( -3x/c + 4 ) = 0\n\nSince b ≠ 0 (as AB has length 2b), then:\n\n-3x/c + 4 = 0\n\n=> 3x/c = 4\n\n=> x = (4c)/3\n\nTherefore, x = 4c/3. Then y = (d/c)(4c/3) = 4d/3\n\nSo point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nAlright, so now we have points M(4b/3, 0) on AB and N(4c/3, 4d/3) on AC.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangle ENG.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of points E, N, and G.\n\nPoint E is the midpoint of AC, which we already found as (c, d)\n\nPoint N is (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nPoint G is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 )\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3 )\n\nTo find the area of triangle ENG, we can use the shoelace formula.\n\nFirst, list the coordinates:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3 )\n\nLet me write them as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3):\n\nx1 = c, y1 = d\n\nx2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3\n\nx3 = (2b + 2c)/3, y3 = 2d/3\n\nThe shoelace formula is:\n\nArea = | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2 |\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2cd)/3\n\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = -4cd/9\n\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = [(2b + 2c)/3]*(d - 4d/3) = [(2b + 2c)/3]*(-d/3) = - (2b + 2c)d /9\n\nNow, sum these terms:\n\n(2cd)/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d /9\n\nLet's convert all terms to ninths:\n\n(2cd)/3 = 6cd/9\n\nSo total:\n\n6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9 = [6cd - 4cd - 2bd - 2cd]/9 = [ (6cd - 4cd - 2cd) - 2bd ]/9 = [0 - 2bd]/9 = -2bd/9\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2:\n\n| -2bd/9 | /2 = (2bd/9)/2 = bd/9\n\nBut from earlier, we found that bd = 72 (since the area of ABC is 144 = 2bd => bd = 72). Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is 72/9 = 8.\n\nWait, but 72 divided by 9 is 8? 72/9 is 8. Yeah, 9*8=72. So the area is 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in the shoelace formula.\n\nLet me recompute the terms carefully.\n\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = 2cd/3\n\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = -4cd/9\n\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = [(2b + 2c)/3]*(d - 4d/3) = [(2b + 2c)/3]*(-d/3) = -(2b + 2c)d/9\n\nSo adding them:\n\n2cd/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9\n\nConvert 2cd/3 to sixths? Wait, 2cd/3 is 6cd/9, right? So:\n\n6cd/9 - 4cd/9 = 2cd/9\n\nThen subtract (2b + 2c)d/9:\n\n2cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9 = [2c d - 2b d - 2c d]/9 = (-2b d)/9\n\nSo the total is -2bd/9. Then absolute value divided by 2: | -2bd/9 | /2 = (2bd/9)/2 = bd/9\n\nSince bd = 72, then 72/9 = 8. So the area is 8. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, the ratio of similarity between triangle AMN and ABC is the ratio of their distances from A. The line MN divides the triangle into a smaller triangle AMN and a trapezoid. Since G is the centroid, which is 1/3 of the way from the base BC to the vertex A, the line MN passes through G, which is 2/3 of the way from the midpoint of BC to the vertex A? Wait, maybe not. Wait, centroid divides the medians in 2:1, so from vertex to centroid is 2/3, centroid to midpoint is 1/3.\n\nBut MN is parallel to BC and passes through G.", "answer": "8"}

So there's this shelf with three bookshelves, totaling 24 books. The top one has 8 mystery books, the middle one has 10 math books, and the bottom one has 6 science books. Then they take two books off each shelf. I need to find what fraction of the remaining books are math books. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the initial number of books on each shelf. The problem says the top shelf has 8 mystery books, the middle has 10 math, and the bottom has 6 science. Adding those up: 8 + 10 + 6. Let me check that: 8 + 10 is 18, plus 6 is 24. Yep, that matches the total given. So that's correct.\n\nNow, two books are removed from each shelf. So each shelf loses two books. Let's figure out how many books are left on each shelf after that. \n\nStarting with the top shelf: originally 8 books. Subtract 2, so 8 - 2 = 6 books left. The middle shelf had 10 math books. Subtract 2, so 10 - 2 = 8 books left. The bottom shelf had 6 science books. Subtract 2, so 6 - 2 = 4 books left. \n\nSo now, let's calculate the total number of books remaining. The top has 6, middle has 8, bottom has 4. Adding those: 6 + 8 + 4. Let me add them: 6 + 8 is 14, plus 4 is 18. So there are 18 books left in total.\n\nOut of these 18, how many are math books? The middle shelf originally had 10 math books, and two were removed, so 8 remain. So the number of math books is 8. \n\nTherefore, the fraction of the remaining books that are math books is 8 out of 18. To simplify that, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 2. 8 ÷ 2 = 4, 18 ÷ 2 = 9. So the simplified fraction is 4/9.\n\nWait, let me double-check everything. Original counts: 8 + 10 + 6 = 24. Correct. After removing two each: 6 + 8 + 4 = 18. Correct. Math books left: 10 - 2 = 8. Correct. So 8/18 reduces to 4/9. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in the subtraction or addition? Let's see. 8 - 2 is definitely 6. 10 - 2 is 8. 6 - 2 is 4. Then 6 + 8 is 14, plus 4 is 18. All correct. Then 8 math books left. So 8/18. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 4/9. \n\nYeah, I think that's it. So the answer should be 4/9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the fraction of remaining books that are math books:\n\n1. **Initial counts**:  \n   - Top shelf (mystery): 8 books  \n   - Middle shelf (math): 10 books  \n   - Bottom shelf (science): 6 books  \n   - Total: \\(8 + 10 + 6 = 24\\) books\n\n2. **After removing 2 books from each shelf**:  \n   - Top shelf: \\(8 - 2 = 6\\) books  \n   - Middle shelf: \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) books (math)  \n   - Bottom shelf: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) books  \n   - Total remaining books: \\(6 + 8 + 4 = 18\\) books\n\n3. **Fraction of math books**:  \n   - Math books left: 8  \n   - Fraction: \\(\\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{4}{9}\\) (simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}}\\)", "answer": "\\frac{4}{9}"}

The problem is about finding the volume of a cone. The formula given is V equals one-third times the base area times the height. Right, so they told us the base area is 30 square units and the height is 6.5 units. I need to plug those numbers into the formula and compute the volume. Hmm, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Yeah, I think it's definitely V = (1/3)Bh. So base area times height divided by three.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The base area is 30, so B is 30. The height h is 6.5. So substituting those values into the formula: V = (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. Let me compute this step by step. First, multiply 30 and 6.5. Let's see, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15, so adding those together gives 195. Then multiply that by 1/3. So 195 divided by 3. Let me divide 195 by 3. 3 goes into 19 six times (3*6=18), remainder 1. Bring down the 5 to make 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. So 65. So 195 divided by 3 is 65. Therefore, the volume should be 65 cubic units.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in multiplying 30 by 6.5. Let's do it another way. 30 multiplied by 6.5. 6.5 can be written as 13/2. So 30 times 13/2. 30 divided by 2 is 15. Then 15 times 13. Let's compute 15*10=150, 15*3=45, so 150+45=195. Yeah, same result. Then 195 divided by 3 is indeed 65. Okay, that seems right.\n\nSo the volume is 65 cubic units. Let me just confirm once more. If the base area is 30 and height is 6.5, then (1/3)*30*6.5. Yes, 30 divided by 3 is 10, so 10*6.5=65. Oh, that's a simpler way to compute it. Instead of multiplying first, you can divide the base area by 3 first. So 30 divided by 3 is 10, then multiply by 6.5. 10*6.5 is 65. Yep, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nI think that's all. The answer should be 65. No steps seem missing, and the arithmetic checks out both ways.

{"original_question": "Se o quarto termo de uma sequência aritmética é $200$ e o oitavo termo é $500$, qual é o sexto termo?", "question": "Se o quarto termo de uma sequência aritmética é $200$ e o oitavo termo é $500$, qual é o sexto termo?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. Hmm, arithmetic sequences, right? Let me recall. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. So, if I denote the first term as a₁ and the common difference as d, then the nth term can be written as aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d. \n\nGiven that the fourth term is 200, that would be a₄ = a₁ + 3d = 200. Similarly, the eighth term is 500, so a₈ = a₁ + 7d = 500. I need to find the sixth term, which is a₆ = a₁ + 5d. \n\nSo, I have two equations:\n1. a₁ + 3d = 200\n2. a₁ + 7d = 500\n\nI can solve these two equations to find a₁ and d, and then plug those into the formula for the sixth term. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a₁. That gives (a₁ + 7d) - (a₁ + 3d) = 500 - 200. Simplifying the left side: a₁ - a₁ + 7d - 3d = 4d. The right side is 300. So, 4d = 300. Dividing both sides by 4, d = 75. \n\nNow that I have the common difference d = 75, I can substitute back into one of the equations to find a₁. Let's use the first equation: a₁ + 3d = 200. Plugging d = 75 in, we get a₁ + 3*75 = 200. Calculating 3*75: 75*3 is 225. So, a₁ + 225 = 200. Subtracting 225 from both sides: a₁ = 200 - 225 = -25. \n\nSo, the first term is -25 and the common difference is 75. Now, to find the sixth term, a₆ = a₁ + 5d. Plugging in the values: a₆ = -25 + 5*75. Let's compute 5*75: 75*5 is 375. Then, -25 + 375 = 350. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If a₁ is -25, then the terms would be:\n\na₁: -25\n\na₂: -25 + 75 = 50\n\na₃: 50 + 75 = 125\n\na₄: 125 + 75 = 200 (which matches the given fourth term)\n\na₅: 200 + 75 = 275\n\na₆: 275 + 75 = 350\n\na₇: 350 + 75 = 425\n\na₈: 425 + 75 = 500 (which matches the given eighth term)\n\nLooks like that checks out. So, the sixth term is 350. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find the sixth term without finding a₁ and d? Let me think. Since the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500, the difference between these two terms is 500 - 200 = 300. The number of terms between the fourth and eighth term is 8 - 4 = 4 terms. So, each term increases by 300 over 4 steps, which would be a common difference of 300/4 = 75, which matches what I found earlier. So, starting from the fourth term (200), adding two common differences (2*75=150) would get to the sixth term. So, 200 + 150 = 350. That's another way to think about it. \n\nEither way, the sixth term is 350. I think that's solid. Both methods give the same answer. I can't see any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 350.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sixth term is \\boxed{350}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is 200 and the eighth term is 500, we need to find the sixth term.\n\nFirst, we denote the first term as \\(a_1\\) and the common difference as \\(d\\).

I need to convert the fraction 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power) into a finite decimal. Hmm, finite decimal means that when you convert the fraction to a decimal, it terminates after a certain number of digits, right? So, I remember that a fraction will have a finite decimal representation if and only if its denominator, after simplifying, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let's write down the denominator: 2² multiplied by 5⁷. So that's 2² × 5⁷. The numerator is 21. Let me see if I can simplify this fraction. Since 21 is 3 × 7, and the denominator is 2² × 5⁷. There are no common factors between 21 and the denominator, because 21 has prime factors 3 and 7, and the denominator has primes 2 and 5. So the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, to convert this to a decimal, I need to express it with a denominator that's a power of 10, because 10 is 2 × 5. The denominator here is 2² × 5⁷. To make it a power of 10, the exponents of 2 and 5 need to be equal. Currently, the exponent of 2 is 2, and the exponent of 5 is 7. So, to make them equal, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2⁵, because 2⁵ will make the exponent of 2 equal to 7 (since 2² × 2⁵ = 2⁷), and then the denominator becomes 2⁷ × 5⁷ = 10⁷. Alternatively, I could multiply by 2⁵ to balance the exponents. Let me write that out.\n\nOriginal fraction: 21 / (2² × 5⁷)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵:\n\nNumerator becomes 21 × 2⁵\n\nDenominator becomes 2² × 2⁵ × 5⁷ = 2⁷ × 5⁷ = 10⁷\n\nSo, the new fraction is (21 × 32) / 10⁷\n\nWait, 2⁵ is 32. So 21 × 32. Let me compute that.\n\n21 × 32: Let's calculate 20 × 32 = 640, and 1 × 32 = 32, so 640 + 32 = 672. So numerator is 672, denominator is 10⁷.\n\nTherefore, 672 divided by 10⁷. Let's write that as a decimal. 672 ÷ 10⁷. Since 10⁷ is 10,000,000, moving the decimal point seven places to the left. The number 672 is 672.0, so moving the decimal seven places left would be 0.0000672. Let me verify:\n\n672 ÷ 10,000,000. Let's count the zeros: 10,000,000 has 7 zeros. So starting from 672, which is 672.0, moving the decimal left 7 places:\n\n672.0 → 67.20 (1)\n6.720 (2)\n0.6720 (3)\n0.06720 (4)\n0.006720 (5)\n0.0006720 (6)\n0.00006720 (7)\n\nSo, yes, it becomes 0.0000672. So, the decimal representation is 0.0000672. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 21/(2²×5⁷) = 21/(4×78125) because 5⁷ is 78125, and 4×78125 is 312,500. So 21 divided by 312,500. Let me compute that division.\n\n21 ÷ 312,500. Let's see. 312,500 × 0.00006 = 18.75, because 312,500 × 0.00006 = 312,500 × 6 × 10^-5 = 1,875,000 × 10^-5 = 18.75. Then 21 - 18.75 = 2.25. So that's 0.00006 plus 2.25/312,500. Hmm, but this seems more complicated. Alternatively, 21 divided by 312,500. Let's write it as 21/312500. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 100: 21/312500 = 0.21/3125. Then 0.21 ÷ 3125. Hmm, maybe that's better. Let me do it step by step.\n\n0.21 divided by 3125. Since 3125 is 5^5, which is 3125. Let's see. 3125 × 0.00006 = 0.1875. So 0.21 - 0.1875 = 0.0225. So that's 0.00006 plus 0.0225/3125. 0.0225 divided by 3125. Let's compute 0.0225 ÷ 3125. 0.0225 is 2.25 × 10^-2. 3125 is 3.125 × 10^3. So, (2.25 × 10^-2) / (3.125 × 10^3) = (2.25 / 3.125) × 10^-5. 2.25 divided by 3.125. Let's compute that: 2.25 ÷ 3.125. Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 2250 ÷ 3125. 3125 × 0.72 = 2250 (since 3125 × 0.7 = 2187.5, 3125 × 0.02 = 62.5; 2187.5 + 62.5 = 2250). So that's 0.72. So, 0.72 × 10^-5 = 0.0000072. So adding that to the previous 0.00006 gives 0.00006 + 0.0000072 = 0.0000672. So that matches the previous result. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Since the denominator is 10^7, which is 1 followed by 7 zeros, so 10,000,000. So 672 over 10,000,000 is 0.0000672. Yes, that seems straightforward. So, the decimal representation is 0.0000672. Let me check if there's any other way to see this. Maybe breaking down the fraction into parts.\n\nThe original fraction is 21 divided by (2² × 5⁷). Let's separate the denominator into 2² and 5⁷. So, 21/(2² × 5⁷) = (21/5⁷) × (1/2²). Let's compute 21 divided by 5⁷ first. 5⁷ is 78125. So 21/78125. Let's compute that. 21 ÷ 78125. Hmm, 78125 × 0.00027 = 21. Let's check: 78125 × 0.0002 = 15.625, 78125 × 0.00007 = 5.46875. So 15.625 + 5.46875 = 21.09375. That's a bit over. So 0.00027 is 78125 × 0.00027 = 21.09375, which is 0.09375 over. So maybe 0.00027 - (0.09375/78125). Wait, this might not be the best way. Alternatively, perhaps using decimal division.\n\nAlternatively, 21 divided by 78125. Let's see, 78125 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal: 0. 78125 goes into 210 zero times. 2100 zero times. 21000 zero times. 210000. 78125 × 2 = 156250. 210000 - 156250 = 53750. Bring down a zero: 537500. 78125 × 6 = 468750. 537500 - 468750 = 68750. Bring down a zero: 687500. 78125 × 8 = 625000. 687500 - 625000 = 62500. Bring down a zero: 625000. 78125 × 8 = 625000. So the decimal is 0.00027 (from the 2, 6, 8, 8). Wait, let's write that step by step:\n\n21 ÷ 78125:\n\n0.\n\nAfter decimal:\n\n21.000000...\n\n78125 | 21.000000\n\n78125 goes into 210000 two times (2*78125=156250)\n\n210000 - 156250 = 53750\n\nBring down 0: 537500\n\n78125 × 6 = 468750\n\n537500 - 468750 = 68750\n\nBring down 0: 687500\n\n78125 × 8 = 625000\n\n687500 - 625000 = 62500\n\nBring down 0: 625000\n\n78125 × 8 = 625000\n\nSo we have 0.00027688...\n\nWait, so 21/78125 = 0.00027688... Hmm, but then we have to multiply that by 1/2², which is 1/4, so 0.00027688... divided by 4. Let's compute that.\n\n0.00027688 divided by 4: 0.00006922...\n\nBut that seems messy. Wait, but earlier when we multiplied numerator and denominator by 2⁵, we got 0.0000672. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let's see. If 21/78125 is 0.00027688..., then multiplying by 1/4 (since 1/2² is 1/4) would be 0.00027688... /4 = 0.00006922... But according to the other method, when we multiplied numerator and denominator by 2⁵, we got 0.0000672. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, there must be a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the first method again. Original fraction: 21/(2²×5⁷). Multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵: numerator becomes 21×32=672, denominator becomes 2⁷×5⁷=10⁷=10,000,000. So 672/10,000,000=0.0000672. That seems straightforward. But in the second method, breaking into 21/78125 ×1/4, which is 0.00027688... ×0.25=0.00006922... But these two results should be the same. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe my decimal conversion of 21/78125 was incorrect. Let me recalculate 21 divided by 78125 properly.\n\nCompute 21 ÷ 78125:\n\nLet me write this as 21 ÷ 78125.

{"original_question": "Quantos inteiros positivos de dois dígitos são fatores de 100 e 150?", "question": "Quantos inteiros positivos de dois dígitos são fatores de 100 e 150?", "response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is asking for numbers that are common factors of both 100 and 150. In other words, these numbers should divide both 100 and 150 without leaving a remainder. Such numbers are called common divisors. So, essentially, I need to find the common divisors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Got it.\n\nTo approach this, I remember that the common divisors of two numbers are the divisors of their greatest common divisor (GCD). Therefore, if I can find the GCD of 100 and 150, then all divisors of this GCD will be the common divisors of both numbers. Then, among those divisors, I need to count how many are two-digit numbers. That makes sense.\n\nSo, first step: find the GCD of 100 and 150. Let me recall how to compute the GCD. One way is to use the prime factorization method. Let's do that.\n\nPrime factorization of 100: 100 divided by 2 is 50, divided by 2 again is 25, then divided by 5 is 5, divided by 5 is 1. So, 100 = 2² × 5².\n\nPrime factorization of 150: 150 divided by 2 is 75, divided by 3 is 25, divided by 5 is 5, divided by 5 is 1. So, 150 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5².\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors. The common primes here are 2 and 5.\n\nFor 2: the lowest power between 2² and 2¹ is 2¹.\n\nFor 5: the lowest power between 5² and 5² is 5².\n\nSo, GCD(100, 150) = 2¹ × 5² = 2 × 25 = 50.\n\nOkay, so the GCD is 50. Therefore, all common divisors of 100 and 150 are the divisors of 50. Now, I need to list all the divisors of 50 and then count how many of them are two-digit numbers.\n\nLet's list the divisors of 50. To do this, I can list pairs of numbers that multiply to 50.\n\n1 × 50 = 50\n\n2 × 25 = 50\n\n5 × 10 = 50\n\nThat's all, since 50 is 50, and the next number would be 10, which we already have. So, the positive divisors of 50 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.\n\nNow, from these divisors, which ones are two-digit numbers? Let's see:\n\n1 is a single-digit number.\n\n2 is single-digit.\n\n5 is single-digit.\n\n10 is two-digit.\n\n25 is two-digit.\n\n50 is two-digit.\n\nSo, the two-digit divisors are 10, 25, and 50. That's three numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I miss any divisors? Let's confirm. 50 is 50. Divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. Yep, that's all. No other numbers. So, the three two-digit numbers are indeed 10, 25, 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the GCD or in listing the divisors. Let me verify GCD(100, 150) again.\n\nPrime factors of 100: 2² × 5².\n\nPrime factors of 150: 2 × 3 × 5².\n\nGCD is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. So, 2^1 × 5^2 = 2 × 25 = 50. Correct.\n\nDivisors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. Correct. So, two-digit numbers: 10, 25, 50. Three numbers.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach the problem is to list all two-digit numbers from 10 to 99 and check which ones divide both 100 and 150. But that seems tedious, but maybe we can confirm with an example.\n\nTake 10: 100 ÷ 10 = 10, which is integer; 150 ÷ 10 = 15, also integer. So, 10 is a common divisor.\n\n25: 100 ÷ 25 = 4, 150 ÷ 25 = 6. Both integers. Good.\n\n50: 100 ÷ 50 = 2, 150 ÷ 50 = 3. Both integers. Correct.\n\nCheck another number, say 20: 100 ÷ 20 = 5, which is fine, but 150 ÷ 20 = 7.5, which is not an integer. So, 20 is not a common divisor.\n\nSimilarly, 15: 150 ÷ 15 = 10, but 100 ÷ 15 ≈ 6.666, not integer. So, not a common divisor.\n\nSo, indeed, only 10, 25, 50 are two-digit numbers that divide both 100 and 150. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using the listing of factors of 100 and 150 and then finding common two-digit ones. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, list all two-digit factors of 100.\n\nFactors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nSo, two-digit factors are 10, 20, 25, 50.\n\nNow, list all two-digit factors of 150.\n\nFactors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nTwo-digit factors are 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75.\n\nNow, find the intersection of two-digit factors of 100 and 150.\n\nFrom 100: 10, 20, 25, 50.\n\nFrom 150: 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75.\n\nCommon ones are 10, 25, 50. Same as before. So, three numbers. Therefore, the answer is 3. So, this method also gives 3.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute GCD first and then list divisors, or list the factors of each number and find the intersection, I arrive at the same answer. So, that gives me confidence that the answer is indeed 3.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 using their prime factorizations:\n\n- Prime factorization of 100: \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n- Prime factorization of 150: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\\)\n\nThe GCD is obtained by taking the lowest powers of the common prime factors:\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 = 2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n\nNext, we list all divisors of 50:\n- Divisors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\n\nAmong these divisors, the two-digit numbers are 10, 25, and 50. \n\nTo verify, we can also list the two-digit factors of each number and find their intersection:\n- Two-digit factors of 100: 10, 20, 25, 50\n- Two-digit factors of 150: 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75\n\nThe common factors are 10, 25, and 50.\n\nThus, the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).", "answer": "3"}

Hmm, let me try to understand what that means.\n\nFirst, a perfect n-th power means that there exists some integer k such that kⁿ = 2²⁴. So, we need to find all integers n > 1 for which 2²⁴ can be expressed as kⁿ for some integer k. \n\nLet me think. If 2²⁴ is a perfect n-th power, then n must divide the exponent 24 when we write 2²⁴ in terms of prime factors. Wait, is that right? Because if we have a number like 2^a, and we want it to be a perfect n-th power, then a must be divisible by n. Because 2^(a/n) must be an integer. So, n has to be a divisor of 24. Let me check that.\n\nSuppose n divides 24. Then 24 = n * m, where m is an integer. So, 2²⁴ = (2^m)^n, which is indeed a perfect n-th power. Conversely, if n does not divide 24, then 24/n is not an integer, so 2^(24/n) would not be an integer, meaning that 2²⁴ cannot be written as kⁿ. So, the problem reduces to finding all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me confirm. If n is a divisor of 24, then 24/n is an integer, so 2^(24/n) is an integer, hence 2²⁴ is a perfect n-th power. So, yes, n must be a divisor of 24. Therefore, the answer is the number of positive divisors of 24 minus 1 (since we need n > 1). \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me test with an example. Let's take n = 2. Then 2²⁴ is (2¹²)², which is a perfect square. That works. If n = 3, 2²⁴ is (2⁸)³, since 8*3=24. That works too. If n = 4, (2⁶)⁴ = 2²⁴. Yep, works. Similarly, n = 6, (2⁴)⁶ = 2²⁴. So, all divisors of 24 greater than 1 should work. \n\nSo, first, let's list all positive divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is 2³ * 3¹. The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 4*2 = 8. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. But we need n > 1, so excluding 1, that leaves 7 divisors. But wait, hold on. Let me confirm. 24 has divisors:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Yes, that's 8 divisors. So, subtract 1 for n > 1, so 7. Therefore, the answer should be 7. But wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, but the question says \"for how many positive integers n > 1\", so we need to count the number of divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. Since 24 has 8 divisors, subtract 1 gives 7. Therefore, the answer is 7. \n\nBut let me confirm with specific examples. For n = 5, which is not a divisor of 24, 2²⁴ is not a perfect 5th power. Similarly, n = 7, which is also not a divisor of 24, 2²⁴ is not a perfect 7th power. So, only the divisors of 24 greater than 1 work. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 7. Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of divisors. Let's list them:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 8. So, excluding 1, 7. So, the answer is 7. Hmm. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If n is a divisor of 24, then 24 = n * m, where m is an integer. Then 2²⁴ = (2^m)^n. So, 2^m is an integer, so yes, that's a perfect n-th power. So, n must divide 24, and n > 1. So, the number of such n is equal to the number of divisors of 24 minus 1 (for n=1). Therefore, 8 - 1 = 7. \n\nBut let me check if n=24 is allowed. Yes, n=24, then 2²⁴ = (2)^24, which is a 24th perfect power. So, n=24 is included. Similarly, n=12: 2²⁴ = (2^2)^12 = 4^12, which is a perfect 12th power. So, all divisors greater than 1. So, yes, 7. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 7. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just check once again if I counted the divisors correctly. \n\nPrime factorization of 24 is 2³ * 3¹. The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 8. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, 8 divisors. Subtract 1 for n>1, so 7. So, the answer is 7. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a catch here. Let me see. Suppose n is a divisor of 24, but maybe there's a case where even if n divides 24, there might be some restrictions? Wait, but 2 is prime, so 2²⁴ is already a prime power, so any n-th root of it would have to be 2^(24/n). Since 24/n must be an integer, that's the only possible k. So, yes, n must divide 24, and k is 2^(24/n). Therefore, all n that divide 24 and are greater than 1 are valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1, which is 7. \n\nBut just to make sure, let's take a specific case. Let's take n=6. Then 2²⁴ = (2⁴)^6 = 16^6. Which is correct. Similarly, n=8: 2²⁴ = (2³)^8 = 8^8. Correct. n=12: (2²)^12 = 4^12. Correct. n=24: (2)^24. Correct. So, all these work. And the divisors not greater than 1 are only n=1, which is excluded. So, the answer is 7. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) exist such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, we need to find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. \n\nA number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power if and only if \\( n \\) divides 24.

Quantos níqueis ela tem?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Hillary having eleven coins, all of which are either dimes or nickels. The total value of these coins is 75 cents. We need to find out how many nickels she has. Hmm, right. So, first, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two types of coins: dimes and nickels. Dimes are worth 10 cents each, and nickels are 5 cents each. She has a total of 11 coins, and together they add up to 75 cents. We need to figure out how many of those are nickels.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. Let me denote the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. The problem states that she has a total of 11 coins, so that gives us the first equation: D + N = 11. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, the total value is 75 cents. Since each dime is 10 cents, the total value from dimes would be 10D cents. Similarly, each nickel is 5 cents, so the total value from nickels is 5N cents. Adding those together gives the total value: 10D + 5N = 75. So now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of D and N. Since we're asked specifically for the number of nickels (N), we can solve for N. Let me think about the best way to approach this. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution first because it seems straightforward.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express D in terms of N. So, D = 11 - N. Then substitute this into the second equation. Let's do that.\n\nReplace D in the second equation with (11 - N):\n\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\nLet's compute that step by step. First, multiply out the 10:\n\n10*11 = 110\n10*(-N) = -10N\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-10N + 5N = -5N\n\nSo now:\n\n110 - 5N = 75\n\nSubtract 110 from both sides:\n\n-5N = 75 - 110\n-5N = -35\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nN = (-35)/(-5) = 7\n\nSo N = 7. Therefore, there are 7 nickels. Let me check if this makes sense. If there are 7 nickels, then the number of dimes would be 11 - 7 = 4 dimes. Let's verify the total value.\n\n4 dimes: 4 * 10 = 40 cents\n7 nickels: 7 * 5 = 35 cents\nTotal: 40 + 35 = 75 cents, which matches the given total. So that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try solving using elimination. Let's see. If we take the two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nIf we multiply the first equation by 5, we get:\n\n5D + 5N = 55\n\nThen subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(10D + 5N) - (5D + 5N) = 75 - 55\n10D + 5N -5D -5N = 20\n5D = 20\nD = 4\n\nThen, since D = 4, substitute back into the first equation: 4 + N = 11 => N = 7. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nEither way, substitution or elimination, we get N = 7. Therefore, the number of nickels is 7. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using different reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, if all 11 coins were dimes, the total value would be 11*10 = 110 cents, which is 35 cents too much compared to the actual total of 75. Each nickel is worth 5 cents less than a dime. So, to reduce the total by 35 cents, we need to replace some dimes with nickels. Each replacement reduces the total by 5 cents. So, the number of replacements needed is 35/5 = 7. Therefore, she needs to replace 7 dimes with nickels, resulting in 7 nickels and 4 dimes. That's another way to think about it, which also gives the same answer. So all methods point to 7 nickels.\n\nJust to make sure, let's try plugging in different numbers. Suppose she had 6 nickels. Then she would have 5 dimes. 6*5 + 5*10 = 30 + 50 = 80 cents. That's too much. If she has 7 nickels and 4 dimes, that's 35 + 40 = 75, which is correct. If she had 8 nickels, that would be 8*5 = 40 cents, and 3 dimes: 30 cents. Total 70 cents, which is less. So 7 is the correct number.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 7 nickels.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of nickels Hillary has is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the number of dimes and \\( N \\) be the number of nickels. We know the following:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   D + N = 11\n   \\]\n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents:\n   \\[\n   10D + 5N = 75\n   \\]\n\nFirst, solve for \\( D \\) from the first equation:\n\\[\nD = 11 - N\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( D \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( N \\):\n\\[\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75 \\\\\n110 - 5N = 75 \\\\\n-5N = 75 - 110 \\\\\n-5N = -35 \\\\\nN = \\frac{-35}{-5} \\\\\nN = 7\n\\]\n\nVerify the solution by substituting \\( N = 7 \\) back into the equations. If there are 7 nickels, then there are \\( 11 - 7 = 4 \\) dimes. The total value is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 10 + 7 \\times 5 = 40 + 35 = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of nickels is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).", "answer": "7"}

Qual é a probabilidade de que a soma dos números que eles escolhem seja par?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so Paul and Jesse each choose a number randomly from the first six prime numbers. We need to find the probability that the sum of their numbers is even. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the first six prime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Wait, is that right? Let me check:\n\n2 is prime.\n\n3 is prime.\n\n4 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n\n5 is prime.\n\n6 is not prime.\n\n7 is prime.\n\n8 is not prime.\n\n9 is not prime (divisible by 3).\n\n10 is not prime.\n\n11 is prime.\n\n12 is not prime.\n\n13 is prime.\n\nSo yes, the first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Got that.\n\nNow, each person picks a number from these six primes, right? And they pick them randomly. So Paul picks one, Jesse picks another. Are their choices independent? I think so. So the total number of possible outcomes is 6 (Paul's choices) multiplied by 6 (Jesse's choices), which is 36 possible pairs. So 36 total outcomes.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sum is even. When is a sum even? A sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. Because even + even = even, and odd + odd = even. But even + odd = odd. So, the key is whether both numbers are even or both are odd.\n\nBut looking at the first six primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Wait, 2 is the only even prime number here. The rest are odd. So, out of the six primes, only one is even (2) and the other five are odd (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).\n\nSo, for the sum to be even, either both Paul and Jesse pick even numbers, or both pick odd numbers. But since there's only one even prime (2), the probability of picking an even number is 1/6, and the probability of picking an odd number is 5/6.\n\nSo, let's compute the probability of both picking even numbers. That would be (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nThen, the probability of both picking odd numbers. Since there are 5 odd primes, the probability for Paul is 5/6, and for Jesse is also 5/6. So that's (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of the sum being even is 1/36 + 25/36 = 26/36. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 13/18.\n\nWait, let me verify again. So, total possible outcomes: 6*6=36.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes: when both pick even or both pick odd.\n\nNumber of ways both pick even: only 1 even number (2), so Paul can pick 2, then Jesse can pick 2.

I have this problem here: the point (a, b) is on the line with the equation 3x + 2y = 12. When a = 4, what is the value of b? Hmm, right. So, they want me to find the y-coordinate when the x-coordinate is 4 on this line. \n\nFirst, I remember that a point (a, b) lying on a line means that when you plug in a for x and b for y in the equation, the equation holds true. So, substituting a = 4 into the equation should let me solve for b. Let me write that out.\n\nThe equation is 3x + 2y = 12. If x is 4, then substituting gives 3*(4) + 2y = 12. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12. So, 12 + 2y = 12. Hmm, subtract 12 from both sides to solve for y. That would give 2y = 12 - 12, which is 0. Then, dividing both sides by 2, y = 0. So, does that mean b is 0?\n\nWait, let me double-check. If x is 4, then plugging into 3x + 2y = 12: 3*4 is 12, so 12 + 2y = 12. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2y = 0. Divide by 2: y = 0. Yeah, that seems right. So, when a is 4, b must be 0. \n\nBut maybe I should visualize the line to make sure. The equation 3x + 2y = 12 is a straight line. Let me find its intercepts to understand its graph. When x = 0, 3*0 + 2y = 12, so 2y = 12, y = 6. So, the y-intercept is (0, 6). When y = 0, 3x + 2*0 = 12, so 3x = 12, x = 4. So, the x-intercept is (4, 0). Oh, so the line crosses the x-axis at (4, 0). That means when x is 4, y is indeed 0. So, that checks out with the previous calculation. \n\nTherefore, the value of b when a = 4 is 0. I think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. Substitute x = 4 into the equation, solve for y. The arithmetic seems straightforward. 3*4 is 12, subtract 12 from both sides gives 2y = 0, so y = 0. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to graph the line, starting from the x-intercept (4, 0), the line goes up 2 units and left 3 units each time? Wait, actually, the slope of the line can be calculated. Let's see. The equation is 3x + 2y = 12. Solving for y, we get 2y = -3x + 12, so y = (-3/2)x + 6. So, the slope is -3/2. That means for every increase of 2 in y, x decreases by 3. But maybe that's more complicated. \n\nBut since we already found the intercepts, and substituting x = 4 gives y = 0, which is the x-intercept, that's confirmed. So, the point (4, 0) is on the line, which is exactly the x-intercept. So, everything lines up. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The answer should be b = 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the point \\((a, b)\\) on the line with the equation \\(3x + 2y = 12\\), we need to find the value of \\(b\\) when \\(a = 4\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(a = 4\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n3(4) + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(3 \\times 4\\):\n\\[\n12 + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\\[\n2b = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nb = 0\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we check the x-intercept of the line \\(3x + 2y = 12\\).

The problem says that twelve 1x1 squares form a rectangle, as shown in the Asymptote figure. We need to find the total area of the shaded region. Hmm, since each square is 1x1, the area of each is 1, so the total area should be twelve, right? But the question is about the shaded area, not the whole rectangle. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the figure. The Asymptote code draws a grid with some shaded triangles. Let me try to parse the Asymptote code. It says: size(4cm); which sets the size. Then defaultpen(linewidth(0.75)); sets the line width. \n\nThe coordinates in the fill commands are (0,4)--(0,0)--(2,0)--cycle and (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle. So the first shaded region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The second shaded region is a quadrilateral with vertices (0,4), (3,4), (3,0), and back to (0,0). Wait, no, the last command is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle. So that's a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). \n\nSo there are two shaded regions: one is a right triangle with base 2 and height 4, and the other is a right triangle with base 3 and height 4. But wait, the second one is (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0) to cycle. So that's actually a triangle with base from (0,4) to (3,4) which is 3 units, and then down to (3,0). So that's a right triangle with legs 3 and 4. Similarly, the first one is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). So that's a right triangle with legs 4 and 2. \n\nBut each of these regions is shaded. Since each small square is 1x1, the area of each triangle can be calculated using the formula (1/2)*base*height. \n\nSo for the first triangle: base is 2, height is 4. Area is (1/2)*2*4 = 4. \n\nFor the second triangle: base is 3, height is 4. Area is (1/2)*3*4 = 6. \n\nSo total shaded area would be 4 + 6 = 10. But wait, the problem says twelve 1x1 squares form the rectangle. If the total area of the rectangle is 12, but shaded area is 10, that seems possible? But maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, let me check the Asymptote code again. The first fill is (0,4)--(0,0)--(2,0)--cycle. That is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The coordinates here: along the y-axis from (0,4) to (0,0) is 4 units, and then to (2,0) is 2 units along the x-axis. So yes, that's a right triangle with legs 4 and 2. \n\nThe second fill is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle. Wait, (0,4) to (3,4) is 3 units along the x-axis at y=4, then down to (3,0), which is 4 units down. So that's a right triangle with legs 3 and 4. \n\nSo their areas are 4 and 6, totaling 10. But the entire rectangle is twelve 1x1 squares, so 12x1=12. So the unshaded area would be 12 - 10 = 2. But is that possible? \n\nWait, but maybe the shaded regions overlap? If the two triangles overlap, then adding their areas would count the overlapping region twice. But looking at the coordinates, the first triangle is from (0,0) to (0,4) to (2,0). The second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So do they overlap? \n\nLet me sketch mentally. The first triangle is in the left half, from the top-left corner (0,4) down to (0,0) and then right to (2,0). The second triangle is starting from (0,4) going right to (3,4) and then down to (3,0). So these two triangles meet at (0,4) and (2,0) for the first triangle, and (0,4) and (3,0) for the second triangle. Wait, actually, the first triangle has vertices at (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). The second triangle has vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So the two triangles share the edge from (0,4) to (0,0) for the first triangle, and from (0,4) to (3,4) for the second triangle. Wait, no, actually, the first triangle is (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0) to (0,4). The second is (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0) to (0,4). So they share the point (0,4), but do they share any other area?\n\nThe first triangle is the area below the line from (0,4) to (2,0). The second triangle is the area below the line from (0,4) to (3,4) and then down to (3,0). Wait, actually, the second triangle is a right triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So that's a triangle that goes from the top-left corner (0,4) along the top edge to (3,4), then down to (3,0), forming a right triangle. \n\nSo the first triangle is from (0,4) down to (0,0) and then right to (2,0). The second triangle is from (0,4) right to (3,4) and down to (3,0). These two triangles might overlap in some region. Let's check. \n\nThe first triangle spans from x=0 to x=2, y=0 to y=4. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the first triangle is a right triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). So it's a triangle that goes from the top-left corner down to the bottom-left corner, then right to (2,0). So it's a triangle with base along the left edge from (0,4) to (0,0), then a horizontal line to (2,0). So the area is a right triangle with legs 4 and 2. \n\nThe second triangle is (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So that's a triangle that goes from the top-left corner along the top edge to (3,4), then down to (3,0). So it's a right triangle with legs 3 and 4. \n\nDo these triangles overlap? Let's see. The first triangle is between x=0 and x=2, the second is between x=0 and x=3. So they overlap from x=0 to x=2. But in terms of y, the first triangle goes from y=0 to y=4, but it's bounded by the lines connecting (0,4) to (2,0). The second triangle goes from y=0 to y=4 as well but is bounded by the line from (0,4) to (3,4) and then down to (3,0). \n\nSo the overlapping region would be where both triangles are present. Let's think about the lines. The first triangle's hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (2,0). The equation of that line is y = (-4/2)x + 4, which simplifies to y = -2x + 4. \n\nThe second triangle's hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (3,4), which is a horizontal line at y=4, then down to (3,0). The hypotenuse from (0,4) to (3,0) would have the equation y = (-4/3)x + 4. \n\nSo the overlapping region is between x=0 to x=2, and between the two hypotenuses. Wait, actually, the overlapping region would be where both triangles are covered. Let's see. \n\nFrom x=0 to x=2, the first triangle is below the line y = -2x + 4, and the second triangle is above the line y = (-4/3)x + 4? Wait, maybe not. Let's find the intersection point of the two hypotenuses. \n\nFirst hypotenuse: y = -2x + 4. Second hypotenuse: from (0,4) to (3,0), which is y = (-4/3)x + 4. Wait, actually, the second triangle's hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (3,0), which is the same as the first hypotenuse from (0,4) to (2,0) extended to (3,0). Wait, no. Wait, the second triangle's hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (3,0), which is a different line. Wait, but (0,4) to (3,0) is the same as the first hypotenuse from (0,4) to (2,0) and then extending to (3,0). Wait, no, actually, the first hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (2,0), and the second is from (0,4) to (3,0). So they form different lines. \n\nWait, but actually, the second triangle is formed by the points (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So the hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (3,0), which is the line y = (-4/3)x + 4. \n\nThe first triangle's hypotenuse is from (0,4) to (2,0), which is y = (-2)x + 4. \n\nThese two lines intersect at some point. Let's find their intersection. \n\nSet y = -2x + 4 and y = (-4/3)x + 4. \n\nSo:\n\n-2x + 4 = (-4/3)x + 4\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n-2x = (-4/3)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n-6x = -4x\n\nAdd 6x to both sides:\n\n0 = 2x => x = 0\n\nSo they only intersect at x=0, which is the point (0,4). Therefore, the two triangles do not overlap except at the point (0,4). So their areas don't overlap. Therefore, the total shaded area is indeed 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut wait, the entire rectangle is twelve 1x1 squares, so area 12. So the unshaded area would be 12 - 10 = 2. But let me check if the figure is as I imagine. Since the Asymptote code draws a grid from (0,0) to (3,4), right? The grid is 4 units high and 3 units wide, since there are three vertical lines at x=0,1,2,3 and four horizontal lines at y=0,1,2,3,4. So the rectangle is 3 units wide (from x=0 to x=3) and 4 units tall (from y=0 to y=4). So area 3*4=12, which matches twelve 1x1 squares. \n\nNow, the shaded regions: the first triangle is from (0,4) down to (0,0) and then right to (2,0). So that's a triangle in the bottom-left corner, spanning x=0 to x=2, y=0 to y=4, but only the part below the line from (0,4) to (2,0). The second triangle is from (0,4) right to (3,4) and down to (3,0). So that's a triangle in the top-right, spanning x=0 to x=3, y=0 to y=4, but only the part below the line from (0,4) to (3,0). \n\nWait, but since the grid is 3 units wide and 4 units tall, the coordinates go from (0,0) to (3,4). So the two triangles are in different corners. The first is in the bottom-left, the second in the top-right. Since their hypotenuses don't intersect except at (0,4), their areas don't overlap. Therefore, adding their areas is correct. \n\nSo the total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, the answer should be 10. But wait, the problem says \"Doze quadrados de 1 por 1 formam um retângulo\", which translates to \"Twelve 1x1 squares form a rectangle, as shown. What is the total area of the shaded region?\" So according to my calculation, 10. But let me verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the areas. Let's recalculate. \n\nFirst triangle: vertices (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). So base is 2, height is 4. Area is (1/2)*2*4 = 4. Correct. \n\nSecond triangle: vertices (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So base is 3, height is 4. Area is (1/2)*3*4 = 6. Correct. \n\nTotal shaded area: 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"regions sombreada\", which is plural. Maybe there are more shaded regions in the figure? The Asymptote code only has two fills. Let me check the code again. \n\nThe code says:\n\nfill((0, 4)--(0, 0)--(2, 0)--cycle, gray(0.75));\n\nfill((0, 4)--(3, 4)--(3, 0)--cycle, gray(0.75));\n\nSo only two shaded regions. So total shaded area is 10. \n\nBut wait, the rectangle is 3x4, which is 12. If shaded area is 10, then unshaded is 2. But in the grid, maybe there are two 1x1 squares unshaded? Let me see", "answer": "10"}
{"original_question": "Qual é o menor múltiplo positivo de 450 cujos dígitos são todos zeros e uns?", "question": "Qual é o menor múltiplo positivo de 450 cujos dígitos são todos zeros e uns?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The multiple has to be divisible by 450, which factors into 9 * 50, right? So 450 = 9 * 50. Therefore, the number must be divisible by both 9 and 50. \n\nFirst, let's recall the divisibility rules. For a number to be divisible by 50, it must end with 00, 50, or 100, etc. But since all digits can only be 0 or 1, the number must end with two 0s. Because 50 is 5*10, but 5 isn't allowed as a digit. Wait, actually, if the number is divisible by 50, the last two digits must be 00, 50, 00, etc. But since only 0 and 1 are allowed, the only possibility is 00. So the number must end with two zeros. Therefore, the number must have at least two zeros at the end. So the number is of the form 1...100.\n\nNow, also, the number must be divisible by 9. The divisibility rule for 9 is that the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the digits are only 0s and 1s, the sum of the digits is just the number of 1s. Therefore, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. So the number must have 9, 18, 27, etc., 1s. \n\nSo, putting it together, the number must end with two zeros and have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9. So the smallest such number would have 9 ones followed by two zeros. But wait, is that correct? Let's check.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smaller number. For example, maybe 11111111100 (nine 1s and two 0s). But is there a smaller number? For example, maybe with fewer digits. Let's see. The number must have at least two zeros at the end. Then, the remaining digits (the part before the two zeros) must consist of 1s, and the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. So the minimal number of 1s is 9. Therefore, the minimal number would be 11111111100. But let me verify if this number is indeed divisible by 450. \n\nFirst, check divisibility by 50: the last two digits are 00, so yes. Then check divisibility by 9: sum of digits is 9*1=9, which is divisible by 9. So 11111111100 is divisible by 450. But is there a smaller number? Let's see. For example, maybe 11111111100 is 11 digits long. Maybe there's a number with fewer digits. Let's see. Suppose we have 9 ones and two zeros. So, if we can arrange the 9 ones and two zeros in such a way that the number is smaller. But numbers with the same number of digits but with 1s and 0s arranged in a way that the number is smaller. Wait, but 11111111100 is the smallest number with nine 1s and two 0s. Because the leftmost digits are the most significant. So putting all the 1s first and then zeros would give the smallest number. So 11111111100 is 11 digits long. Is there a way to get a smaller number with the same number of digits but maybe more zeros? But no, because more zeros would make the number smaller, but we need the number of 1s to be 9. So 11111111100 is the smallest possible. Wait, but maybe there's a number with fewer digits. Let's check. Suppose we have 9 ones and two zeros. Then the total digits are 11. If we have fewer digits, say 10 digits. Then, the number of 1s must be 9, but with two zeros, but 9 + 2 = 11 digits. So 10 digits can't have 9 ones and two zeros. Wait, 9 ones and two zeros is 11 digits. So with 10 digits, you could have at most 9 ones and one zero, but that would only sum to 9, but not 10 digits. Wait, no, if you have 10 digits, the maximum number of ones is 10, but we need the sum of digits to be a multiple of 9. So the minimal number is 9 ones. So 9 ones and two zeros, 11 digits. So 11111111100 is the smallest. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a smaller number with more zeros but fewer digits. Wait, but in terms of numerical value, adding more zeros at the end would make the number larger. For example, 10011111100 is larger than 11111111100. So the smallest number would be the one with the 1s as far left as possible. So 11111111100 is indeed the smallest. \n\nBut let me verify this. Let's check if 11111111100 is divisible by 450. First, check divisibility by 50: last two digits are 00, so yes. Then check divisibility by 9: sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, yes, 11111111100 is divisible by 450. \n\nBut is there a smaller number? Let's think. Suppose we have a number like 11111111100 (11 digits) versus a number with more digits but starting with more zeros. Wait, but starting with more zeros would make the number smaller in value. But the problem is that the number must consist of 0s and 1s. So the smallest number with 9 ones and two zeros is indeed 11111111100. If we add more zeros in between, the number becomes larger. For example, 10011111100 is 10011111100, which is larger than 11111111100. So 11111111100 is the smallest. \n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the number can have leading zeros? But no, because leading zeros are not allowed in numbers. So the first digit must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number is 11111111100. \n\nBut let me check another possibility. What if the number is 11111111100, but maybe there is a smaller number with more zeros but the same number of digits. Wait, but in the same number of digits, putting more zeros would make the number smaller. For example, 10011111100 is 10011111100, which is 10 digits, but 11111111100 is 11 digits. Wait, no. Wait, 11111111100 is 11 digits. If we have a number with 10 digits, the maximum number of 1s is 10, but sum of digits must be 9. So 9 ones and 1 zero, but that's 10 digits. Wait, but 9 ones and 1 zero sum to 10 digits. Then the number would be 1111111110. But check if that's divisible by 450. \n\nWait, 1111111110: ends with a 0, so divisible by 10, but not necessarily by 50. To be divisible by 50, it needs to end with 00. So 1111111110 ends with a 0, which is divisible by 10 but not 50. Therefore, not divisible by 50. So that number is not valid. \n\nTherefore, to be divisible by 50, the number must end with two zeros. Therefore, 11 digits is the minimal. So 11111111100. \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose we have a number with 9 ones and two zeros. The problem is, if we can arrange the zeros in such a way that the number is smaller. For example, 100000000100 is 100000000100, which is 13 digits. But 11111111100 is 11 digits. So 11 digits is smaller. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 11111111100 is the smallest. But let me check if there's a number with 9 ones and two zeros arranged in a way that it's smaller. Wait, but the leftmost digits are the most significant. So putting all the ones first and then zeros gives the smallest number. \n\nSo 11111111100 is indeed the smallest number with nine 1s and two 0s. Therefore, the answer should be 11111111100. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a number with fewer digits. For example, if we have 9 ones and two zeros, that's 11 digits. If we can have a number with 9 ones and two zeros but in fewer digits, that's impossible because 9 + 2 = 11. So 11 digits is the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the minimal multiple is 11111111100. \n\nBut let me confirm this with actual division. Let's divide 11111111100 by 450. \n\nFirst, 11111111100 divided by 10 is 1111111110. Then divide by 50: 1111111110 divided by 50 is 22222222.2. Wait, that's not an integer. Wait, but 11111111100 divided by 50 is 222222222. So 11111111100 divided by 50 is 22,222,222.2? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 11111111100 / 50. \n\nDivide 11111111100 by 50: 11111111100 ÷ 50 = 11111111100 ÷ 10 ÷ 5 = 1111111110 ÷ 5. \n\n1111111110 ÷ 5: 5*2=10, so 222222222. So yes, 11111111100 ÷ 50 = 222222222, which is an integer. Then, check if this is divisible by 9. Wait, 222222222 is the result. Let's check if 222222222 is divisible by 9. Sum of digits: 2*9=18, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, 222222222 is divisible by 9. Therefore, 11111111100 is divisible by 450. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is indeed the smallest such number. \n\nBut just to make sure there isn't a smaller number, let's think if there's another way. Suppose we have a number with 18 ones and two zeros. That would be 20 digits. But 18 ones is more than 9, so the number would be larger. Similarly, numbers with more zeros would require more digits, making the number larger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the ones and zeros differently. For example, inserting zeros in between the ones. But that would make the number larger. For example, 10111111100 is larger than 11111111100. Similarly, 11011111100 is larger. So no, inserting zeros in between the ones makes the number larger. Therefore, the smallest number is when all the ones are first, then the zeros. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 11111111100. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest multiple is \\boxed{11111111100}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive multiple of 450 with digits only 0s and 1s, we need to consider the divisibility rules for 450, which factors into 9 and 50. \n\n1. **Divisibility by 50**: The number must end in 00, as only 0s and 1s are allowed.\n2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits (which are only 0s and 1s) must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.\n\nThe smallest number satisfying both conditions must have the fewest digits possible. The number must end with two 0s and have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is formed by having nine 1s followed by two 0s. \n\n- **Checking divisibility**:\n  - The number ends in 00, so it is divisible by 50.\n  - The sum of the digits is 9 (nine 1s), which is divisible by 9.\n\nThus, the smallest number is 11111111100. This number has nine 1s and two 0s, ends in 00, and meets both divisibility requirements.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11111111100}\n\\]", "answer": "11,\\! 111,\\! 111,\\! 100"}

Qual é a probabilidade de que a peça seja colocada em uma casa sombreada do tabuleiro de damas?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So, the problem is about a wheel that's spun twice, and each spin lands on a number. The first number is divided by 4, and the possible remainders (1, 2, 3) determine the column on a chessboard-like grid. The second number is divided by 5, and the possible remainders (1, 2, 3, 4) determine the row. Then a piece is placed on the intersection of that column and row. We need to find the probability that the piece lands on a dark square.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the chessboard. A standard chessboard has 8x8 squares, alternating between dark and light. But the problem mentions a \"tabuleiro de damas,\" which is like a chessboard but maybe with different dimensions? Wait, the problem says \"tabuleiro de damas\" which is literally \"dama board,\" but in Brazil, they use a different size maybe? Wait, no, the problem says \"tabuleiro de damas\" which in Portuguese means \"dama board,\" but the squares are determined by dividing by 4 and 5. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"O número determinado pela roda é dividido por 4, determinando um dos restos 1, 2, 3 que marcarão as colunas do tabuleiro de damas indicado.\" So, the rest when divided by 4 are 1,2,3 for columns. Similarly, rows are determined by dividing the second number by 5, giving remainders 1,2,3,4. So the tabuleiro de damas must have columns labeled 1,2,3 and rows labeled 1,2,3,4? Wait, but that's not a standard chessboard. Maybe it's a 3x4 grid? So 3 columns and 4 rows?\n\nBut in a standard chessboard, columns and rows would be alternating. Wait, but the problem says \"uma casa sombreada,\" which is a dark square. So we need to know how many dark squares there are in this 3x4 grid. But first, let's confirm the grid size.\n\nWait, columns are determined by dividing by 4, so possible remainders 1,2,3. That would be 3 columns. Rows are determined by dividing by 5, remainders 1,2,3,4, so 4 rows. So the grid is 3 columns by 4 rows. So 12 squares in total. Then, how are the dark squares arranged? In a standard chessboard, the color alternates starting with dark at the top-left. But here, since the grid is 3x4, maybe the coloring alternates similarly. Let me think.\n\nIn a standard 8x8 chessboard, the color alternates every square, so each pair of squares in a row is different. So for a 3x4 grid, each row would have alternating colors. Let's see: starting with dark at the top-left. Then the first row would be dark, light, dark, light. The second row would start with light, dark, light, dark. The third row would start with dark, light, dark, light? But since there are only 4 columns, in the third row, starting with dark, the colors would be dark, light, dark, light. Wait, but in a 3x4 grid, each row has 4 squares. So:\n\nRow 1: Dark, Light, Dark, Light\n\nRow 2: Light, Dark, Light, Dark\n\nRow 3: Dark, Light, Dark, Light\n\nTherefore, in a 3x4 grid, the dark squares are in positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3). Let me count that. Each odd row (1 and 3) has dark squares in columns 1 and 3. Each even row (2) has dark squares in columns 2 and 4. So that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 dark squares out of 12 total. Wait, 3 columns, 4 rows. So 3x4=12 squares. If each odd row has 2 dark squares and even rows have 2 dark squares, total dark squares would be 2*3=6? Wait, no. Wait, in 3 rows: rows 1 and 3 are odd, each with 2 dark squares, that's 4. Row 2 is even, with 2 dark squares. Total 6 dark squares. So 6 out of 12, which is 1/2. Wait, but that seems like half the squares are dark. But in a standard chessboard, half are dark, but here, since the grid is 3x4, which is even in rows but odd in columns? Wait, 3 columns and 4 rows. Hmm, maybe the coloring is such that each cell (i,j) is dark if (i + j) is odd. Let's check.\n\nIf we consider (i + j) odd:\n\nFor (1,1): 1+1=2 even, so light.\n\nWait, maybe the coloring starts with dark at (1,1). So (i + j) even is light, (i + j) odd is dark? Let's check.\n\n(1,1): 1+1=2 even → light.\n\n(1,2): 1+2=3 odd → dark.\n\n(1,3): 1+3=4 even → light.\n\n(1,4): 1+4=5 odd → dark.\n\nSo row 1: light, dark, light, dark.\n\nRow 2: (2,1): 2+1=3 odd → dark.\n\n(2,2): 2+2=4 even → light.\n\n(2,3): 2+3=5 odd → dark.\n\n(2,4): 2+4=6 even → light.\n\nRow 2: dark, light, dark, light.\n\nRow 3: (3,1): 3+1=4 even → light.\n\n(3,2): 3+2=5 odd → dark.\n\n(3,3): 3+3=6 even → light.\n\n(3,4): 3+4=7 odd → dark.\n\nRow 3: light, dark, light, dark.\n\nSo dark squares are in positions (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4). That's 6 dark squares. So 6 out of 12 total. Therefore, the probability of landing on a dark square is 6/12 = 1/2. But wait, the problem might not be a straight 3x4 grid. Wait, the problem says \"a tabuleiro de damas indicado,\" which is \"indicated dam board.\" Maybe the actual chessboard is standard 8x8, but the numbers are determined by dividing by 4 and 5? Wait, but the first number is divided by 4, giving remainders 1,2,3. So that's columns 1,2,3. The second number divided by 5 gives remainders 1,2,3,4, so rows 1,2,3,4. So the grid is 3 columns and 4 rows, making 12 squares. So the problem is about a 3x4 grid. Therefore, the dark squares are 6 out of 12, so probability 1/2. But wait, maybe the actual chessboard is 8x8, but the numbers are mapped to specific columns and rows? Wait, the problem says \"o número determinado pela roda é dividido por 4, determinando um dos restos 1,2,3 que marcarão as colunas do tabuleiro de damas indicado.\" So the columns are labeled 1,2,3 based on division by 4. Similarly, rows are labeled 1,2,3,4 based on division by 5. Therefore, the tabuleiro de damas in question is a 3x4 grid. So the answer should be 6/12 = 1/2. But let me confirm again.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's a \"tabuleiro de damas\" which is a specific board, maybe like a 8x8, but the numbers are determined by division by 4 and 5. Wait, but the possible remainders for columns are 1,2,3 (3 columns) and rows 1,2,3,4 (4 rows). So the board is 3 columns and 4 rows. Therefore, 12 squares. If half of them are dark, then probability 1/2. But maybe in the actual problem, the coloring is different? Wait, but according to the calculation above, if (i + j) is odd, then dark. In a 3x4 grid, with columns 1,2,3 and rows 1,2,3,4, then as we saw, there are 6 dark squares. Therefore, 6/12 = 1/2. But maybe in the problem, the coloring is such that the top-left corner is dark, and then alternates. So that would result in the same as (i + j) odd. So the probability is 1/2. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in Portuguese, and \"tabuleiro de damas\" could be a different size. Wait, but the problem mentions \"coluna\" and \"linha\" (column and row), so it's a grid. The numbers from the wheel are used to determine the column and row. The column is determined by dividing the first number by 4 (remainder 1,2,3), so columns 1,2,3. The row is determined by dividing the second number by 5 (remainder 1,2,3,4), so rows 1,2,3,4. So the grid is 3 columns and 4 rows, 12 squares. If half of them are dark, then probability 1/2. But maybe the actual board is different. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a standard chessboard, but the numbers are mapped to specific columns and rows. Wait, but the numbers are determined by division by 4 and 5. So the first spin determines the column (1,2,3) and the second spin determines the row (1,2,3,4). Therefore, the possible positions are (1,1), (1,2), ..., (3,4). So 3x4 grid. If the coloring is such that the top-left corner is dark, then alternating. As above, 6 dark squares. So probability 6/12=1/2. Therefore, 1/2. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is not about a 3x4 grid. Wait, the problem says \"o número determinado pela roda é dividido por 4, determinando um dos restos 1,2,3 que marcarão as colunas do tabuleiro de damas indicado.\" So the columns are determined by the remainder when divided by 4, which are 1,2,3. So three columns. Similarly, rows are determined by dividing by 5, which gives remainders 1,2,3,4. So four rows. So the grid is 3 columns and 4 rows. Then the total number of possible outcomes is 3*4=12. Each outcome is equally likely, since each number on the wheel is equally probable. Then, the number of dark squares is 6, so the probability is 6/12=1/2. So the answer is 1/2. But wait, maybe the problem is different. Maybe the numbers on the wheel are not equally likely? Wait, the problem says \"cada número na roda é igualmente provável.\" So each number on the wheel is equally probable. So if the wheel has numbers that when divided by 4 give remainders 1,2,3, and when divided by 5 give remainders 1,2,3,4. So the numbers on the wheel for columns are numbers congruent to 1,2,3 mod 4. Similarly, rows are numbers congruent to 1,2,3,4 mod 5. But the problem doesn't specify how many numbers are on the wheel. Wait, but since the remainders are 1,2,3 for columns and 1,2,3,4 for rows, that implies that the wheel for columns has numbers that can be 1,2,3 mod 4, but since remainders are 1,2,3, that means the numbers on the column wheel are numbers like 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11, etc., but since each spin results in a remainder, which is 1,2,3. So the column wheel must have numbers such that when divided by 4, they give 1,2,3. So numbers can be 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11, etc. But since the problem states that the number is determined randomly with each number on the wheel being equally probable. However, since there are three possible remainders, 1,2,3, that implies that the column wheel has three numbers, each corresponding to the remainders 1,2,3. Wait, but if the wheel is divided into sections, each labeled with numbers that when divided by 4 give 1, 2, or 3. So each spin for the column has three possible outcomes, each equally likely. Similarly, the row wheel has numbers that when divided by 5 give 1,2,3,4. So four possible outcomes, each equally likely. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 3*4=12, each with probability 1/12. Then, the number of favorable outcomes (landing on a dark square) is 6. Therefore, the probability is 6/12=1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, the problem says \"o número determinado pela roda é dividido por 4, determinando um dos restos 1,2,3 que marcarão as colunas do tabuleiro de damas indicado.\" So the column is determined by the remainder when the first number is divided by 4. Similarly, the row is determined by the remainder when the second number is divided by 5. Therefore, the possible columns are 1,2,3 and rows are 1,2,3,4. So the grid is 3x4. The coloring alternates starting with dark at (1,1). As we determined earlier, there are 6 dark squares. So 6 favorable outcomes out of 12 total. Therefore, probability 1/2. So the answer is 1/2. But let me check if the grid is indeed 3x4. The column is determined by dividing by 4, so", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}
{"original_question": "Qual é a soma dos dígitos na representação decimal finita da fração $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$?", "question": "Qual é a soma dos dígitos na representação decimal finita da fração $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal finite representation of the fraction 4321 divided by (5^7 multiplied by 2^8). Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that fractions can be converted into decimal form by dividing the numerator by the denominator. However, for the decimal to be finite, the denominator must only have factors of 2 and/or 5. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nThe denominator is 5^7 multiplied by 2^8. Since both 5 and 2 are prime factors, and the denominator is only composed of these primes, the decimal representation should indeed be finite. That makes sense. So, I need to compute 4321 divided by (5^7 * 2^8) and then add up all the digits in that decimal.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than just doing the long division. Let me think. To convert the fraction into a decimal, I can multiply numerator and denominator by a power of 2 or 5 to make the denominator a power of 10, which is straightforward to convert to decimal.\n\nLooking at the denominator: 5^7 * 2^8. Since there are more 2s (8) than 5s (7), I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5 once to make the number of 2s and 5s equal. That would make the denominator 10^8. Wait, let me verify:\n\nMultiplying the denominator by 5 once would give 5^(7+1) * 2^8 = 5^8 * 2^8 = (5*2)^8 = 10^8. Yes, that's right. So, if I multiply numerator and denominator by 5, the denominator becomes 10^8, which is 100,000,000. Then, the decimal would be numerator * 5 divided by 10^8. So, 4321 * 5 = 21,605. Therefore, the decimal is 21,605 / 100,000,000 = 0.00021605. \n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 4321 * 5: 4000*5=20,000; 300*5=1,500; 20*5=100; 1*5=5. Adding those together: 20,000 + 1,500 = 21,500; 21,500 + 100 = 21,600; 21,600 + 5 = 21,605. Yes, that's correct. So, 21,605 divided by 100,000,000 is moving the decimal point 8 places to the left. So, 21,605 becomes 0.00021605. Let me count the digits: 2,1,6,0,5. But wait, after the decimal point, how many digits are there? Let's see: 0.00021605. Let's break it down:\n\n- The first digit after the decimal is 0.\n- Second: 0\n- Third: 0\n- Fourth: 2\n- Fifth: 1\n- Sixth: 6\n- Seventh: 0\n- Eighth: 5\n\nSo, that's 8 digits after the decimal point. So, the decimal representation is 0.00021605. Now, we need to sum these digits. Let's list them:\n\nDigits: 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5. Let's compute step by step:\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\n0 + 2 = 2\n\n2 + 1 = 3\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n9 + 0 = 9\n\n9 + 5 = 14\n\nSo, the sum of the digits is 14. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me verify once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the decimal conversion. Let's confirm:\n\nIf we have 21,605 divided by 100,000,000, which is 21,605 / 10^8. Let's write 21,605 as a decimal less than 1 by moving the decimal point 8 places to the left:\n\n21,605.0 becomes 0.21605 when divided by 10^5, but we need to divide by 10^8, so we need to move the decimal point 8 places. Wait, 21,605 is 21605 * 10^0. To divide by 10^8, it's 21605 * 10^(-8) = 0.21605 * 10^(-3) = 0.00021605. Yes, that's correct. So, the decimal is indeed 0.00021605.\n\nTherefore, the digits are 0 (tenths place), 0 (hundredths), 0 (thousandths), 2 (ten-thousandths), 1 (hundred-thousandths), 6 (millionths), 0 (ten-millionths), 5 (hundred-millionths). So, digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Summing them: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14. So, the answer should be 14.\n\nBut wait, let me check once again if I converted the fraction correctly. The original fraction is 4321/(5^7 * 2^8). We can write this as 4321/(5^7 * 2^8) = (4321 * 5)/(5^8 * 2^8) = (4321 * 5)/(10^8). Which is 21,605/10^8 = 0.00021605. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to do this. Let me try converting the denominator to have both 2 and 5 exponents first. The denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. To make the denominator a power of 10, which is 10^n, we need the exponents of 2 and 5 to be equal. Since there are more 2s, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(8-7) = 5^1 to balance the exponents. So, multiply numerator and denominator by 5:\n\nNumerator becomes 4321 * 5 = 21,605\n\nDenominator becomes 5^7 * 2^8 * 5 = 5^8 * 2^8 = 10^8\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 21,605/10^8 = 0.00021605\n\nYes, same result. So, decimal is 0.00021605. So, digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Sum is 14. That seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's check if 0.00021605 is indeed equal to 21,605 divided by 100,000,000. Let's compute 21,605 * 10^(-8):\n\n21,605 * 10^(-8) = 0.00021605. Correct. So, that's the decimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the fraction step by step. Let's see:\n\nFirst, divide 4321 by 5^7 * 2^8. Let's compute 5^7 and 2^8 first.\n\n5^7: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125, 3125*5=15,625, 15,625*5=78,125. So, 5^7 = 78,125.\n\n2^8: 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16, 16*2=32, 32*2=64, 64*2=128, 128*2=256. So, 2^8 = 256.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 78,125 * 256. Let's compute that:\n\n78,125 * 256. Hmm, 78,125 * 200 = 15,625,000; 78,125 * 50 = 3,906,250; 78,125 * 6 = 468,750. Adding those together: 15,625,000 + 3,906,250 = 19,531,250; 19,531,250 + 468,750 = 20,000,000. Wait, that's interesting. So, 78,125 * 256 = 20,000,000. So, the denominator is 20,000,000. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 / 20,000,000.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. 5^7 * 2^8 = 78,125 * 256 = 20,000,000? Let me check that multiplication again. Because 78,125 * 256. Let's break it down:\n\n256 is 2^8, which is 16*16. So, 78,125 * 16 = 1,250,000. Then, 1,250,000 * 16 = 20,000,000. Yes, that's correct. So, denominator is 20,000,000. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 / 20,000,000.\n\nSo, converting that to decimal: 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let's compute this.\n\nDividing by 20,000,000 is the same as multiplying by 1/20,000,000. Let's see:\n\n4321 ÷ 20,000,000. Let's write it as 4321 / 20,000,000. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to simplify: 4.321 / 20,000. Then, 4.321 ÷ 20,000. Which is 0.00021605. Exactly the same as before. So, that's correct. Therefore, the decimal is 0.00021605, and the sum of the digits is 14.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 14. But just to be absolutely sure, let me write out the decimal again:\n\n0.00021605\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 0 (tenths place)\n- 0 (hundredths place)\n- 0 (thousandths place)\n- 2 (ten-thousandths place)\n- 1 (hundred-thousandths place)\n- 6 (millionths place)\n- 0 (ten-millionths place)\n- 5 (hundred-millionths place)\n\nSo, digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Sum: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum of the digits is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{14}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the digits in the decimal finite representation of the fraction \\(\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8}\\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal. \n\nThe denominator \\(5^7 \\cdot 2^8\\) can be converted to a power of 10 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5, which balances the exponents of 2 and 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{4321 \\cdot 5}{5^8 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{21605}{10^8}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the decimal \\(0.00021605\\). \n\nNext, we sum the digits of the decimal representation \\(0.00021605\\):\n\n- The digits are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5.\n- Summing these digits: \\(0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\\).\n\nThus, the sum of the digits is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).", "answer": "14"}

Hmm, that's a lot of terms. Let me see if I can simplify this somehow. \n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using trigonometric identities or product formulas. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me list out all the angles again: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. Wait, these angles are all multiples of 20°, right? 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, then 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. So they go from 20° up to 160° in steps of 20°, but not all multiples. Let me check: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. Yes, each is 20° more than the previous. So that's 8 terms, each 20° apart. Interesting.\n\nI also notice that some of these angles are supplementary or have relationships with others. For example, sin100° is sin(80°), since sin(180° - θ) = sinθ. Similarly, sin120° is sin60°, sin140° is sin40°, and sin160° is sin20°. Let me verify that:\n\n- sin100° = sin(80°) because 100° = 180° - 80°\n- sin120° = sin60° because 120° = 180° - 60°\n- sin140° = sin40° because 140° = 180° - 40°\n- sin160° = sin20° because 160° = 180° - 20°\n\nSo that means the original product can be rewritten as:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin60° * sin40° * sin20°\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(sin20°)^2 * (sin40°)^2 * (sin60°)^2 * (sin80°)^2\n\nSo instead of multiplying eight different sines, it's the product of each of these four sines squared. That might make it easier. So now the problem reduces to calculating [sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°]^2.\n\nAlright, let's compute the product inside the square first. Let me denote P = sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°. Then the final answer will be P^2.\n\nSo I need to compute P. Hmm, how can I compute this product? Maybe there's a formula for the product of multiple sine terms. Alternatively, I can use product-to-sum identities, but with four terms that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe recognizing some symmetry or using complex numbers?\n\nWait, another idea: products of sines at angles that are multiples of a certain degree can sometimes be related to roots of unity or specific trigonometric identities. For example, the product of sines of angles that are equally spaced around the unit circle.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that there's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1, but I need to check if that applies here. Wait, but here the angles are in degrees and not in terms of π. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity for sin θ in terms of complex exponentials. Let me recall that sinθ = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i). But multiplying all these sines together would result in a complicated expression. However, maybe if I pair terms in a clever way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that the product of sines can be expressed as a multiple-angle formula. For example, sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. But with four terms, applying this multiple times might get too messy.\n\nWait, another approach: since all these angles are related to 60°, which is a common angle, maybe there's a way to relate them through 60°. Let me check the angles:\n\n20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 80°, 60°, 40°, 20°. So 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° repeated twice each. Wait, but 80° is not repeated. Wait, sin80° is only once. Wait, no, original angles were 20°,40°,60°,80°,100°,120°,140°,160°, which became after substitution sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin80°, sin60°, sin40°, sin20°. So each of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80° appears twice. So the product is (sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°)^2.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°, then square it. Let me focus on that.\n\nFirst, sin60° is sqrt(3)/2, which is known. So maybe that's a helpful term to separate out. Let's write P = sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° = (sqrt(3)/2) * sin20° * sin40° * sin80°. So if I can compute sin20° * sin40° * sin80°, then multiply by sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo let's compute Q = sin20° * sin40° * sin80°. Then P = (sqrt(3)/2) * Q.\n\nSo how can I compute Q? Let's see. Maybe use product-to-sum identities step by step.\n\nFirst, let's take sin20° * sin40°. Using the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.\n\nSo sin20° * sin40° = [cos(20° - 40°) - cos(20° + 40°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos60°]/2 = [cos20° - cos60°]/2, since cosine is even.\n\nNow, cos60° is 0.5. So this becomes [cos20° - 0.5]/2.\n\nTherefore, Q = ([cos20° - 0.5]/2) * sin80°.\n\nSo Q = [cos20° - 0.5]/2 * sin80°.\n\nHmm, let's compute [cos20° - 0.5] * sin80° first.\n\nLet me write this as cos20° * sin80° - 0.5 * sin80°.\n\nLet's compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: cos20° * sin80°. Using the identity sin A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)] / 2.\n\nSo cos20° * sin80° = [sin(80° + 20°) + sin(80° - 20°)] / 2 = [sin100° + sin60°]/2.\n\nSecond term: -0.5 * sin80°.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nQ = [ ([sin100° + sin60°]/2 ) - 0.5 sin80° ] / 2.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me retrace. Q was equal to [cos20° - 0.5]/2 * sin80°, which was equal to [cos20° * sin80° - 0.5 sin80°]/2. Then breaking down cos20° * sin80° into [sin100° + sin60°]/2, so substituting that in:\n\nQ = [ ([sin100° + sin60°]/2 ) - 0.5 sin80° ] / 2.\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nFirst, let's compute [sin100° + sin60°]/2 - 0.5 sin80°, all over 2.\n\nSo:\n\nQ = [ (sin100° + sin60°)/2 - (sin80°)/2 ] / 2\n\n= [ (sin100° + sin60° - sin80°)/2 ] / 2\n\n= (sin100° + sin60° - sin80°)/4\n\nNow, compute sin100° - sin80°. Let's recall that sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2].\n\nSo sin100° - sin80° = 2 cos[(100° + 80°)/2] sin[(100° - 80°)/2] = 2 cos90° sin10°.\n\nBut cos90° is 0, so sin100° - sin80° = 0. Therefore, sin100° + sin60° - sin80° = sin60°.\n\nTherefore, Q = sin60° / 4.\n\nBut sin60° is sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, Q = (sqrt(3)/2) / 4 = sqrt(3)/8.\n\nWait, but wait, let me verify this step again. If sin100° - sin80° = 0, then sin100° = sin80°, which is true because sin100° = sin(80°), since sin(180° - θ) = sinθ. So sin100° = sin80°, so sin100° - sin80° = 0. Therefore, the numerator becomes sin60°, so Q = sin60° / 4 = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8. So Q = sqrt(3)/8.\n\nTherefore, going back to P, which was (sqrt(3)/2) * Q. So P = (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/8) = (3)/16.\n\nTherefore, P = 3/16. Then the original product is P squared, so (3/16)^2 = 9/256.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check this again because this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the algebra.\n\nStarting from Q = sin20° * sin40° * sin80°.\n\nWe first computed sin20° * sin40° = [cos20° - 0.5]/2.\n\nThen multiplied by sin80° to get [cos20° - 0.5] * sin80° / 2.\n\nThen split into two terms: cos20° * sin80° - 0.5 sin80°, each divided by 2.\n\nThen converted cos20° * sin80° into [sin100° + sin60°]/2.\n\nSo then Q became ([sin100° + sin60°]/2 - 0.5 sin80°)/2.\n\nThen sin100° - sin80° = 0, so numerator becomes sin60°, so Q = sin60° / 4.\n\nTherefore, Q = sqrt(3)/8. Then P = (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/8) = (3/16). Then the original product is P squared, so 9/256.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with another approach to be safe. Maybe using complex numbers or another identity.\n\nAlternatively, recall that there is a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The general formula is:\n\nProduct_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{(n-1)}}\n\nBut here, the angles are in degrees, so converting them to radians might be necessary. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the product formula for multiple angles. Wait, maybe for the product of sines of angles that are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are multiples of 20°, up to 80°, which is 4*20°. So n=4, step=20°, but total terms?\n\nWait, the formula I mentioned earlier is for the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1. If we set n=5, then the product would be sin(π/10) sin(2π/10) sin(3π/10) sin(4π/10). Converting 20° to radians is π/9, but 20° is π/9 radians? Wait, 180° is π radians, so 20° is π/9 radians. So 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° in radians are π/9, 2π/9, 3π/9=π/3, 4π/9. So the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) sin(4π/9). Is this the same as our Q?\n\nYes, Q is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, which in radians is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) sin(4π/9). So according to the formula, if n=5, the product would be sqrt(5)/2^{4} = sqrt(5)/16. But our product is sin(π/9) sin(2π", "answer": "\\frac{9}{256}"}

The options are Line, Circle, Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are a way to represent points in 3D space using a radius (r), an angle (θ), and a height (z). So, the coordinates are (r, θ, z). The question is asking about the shape described by z = c. \n\nLet me recall, in Cartesian coordinates, z = c would just be a horizontal plane cutting through the z-axis at height c. But here, it's in cylindrical coordinates. So maybe the same idea applies? Since z is directly given as a constant, maybe it's a plane as well? But wait, planes in cylindrical coordinates... Hmm.\n\nWait, in cylindrical coordinates, each coordinate corresponds to a different direction. The radius r is like the distance from the z-axis, θ is the angle around the z-axis, and z is the height. So if z is fixed, that would mean all points have the same height. But in 3D space, fixing the height would indeed result in a horizontal plane. However, in cylindrical coordinates, is there a difference between a plane and something else?\n\nLet me think again. If we fix z = c, then for any r and θ, the z-coordinate remains c. So, that's all the points where z is c, regardless of r and θ. So, in Cartesian coordinates, that would be the plane z = c, right? So in cylindrical coordinates, z = c would also represent a plane, but which plane?\n\nWait, the answer choices include Plane (C). So maybe the answer is C. But let me make sure. Let's compare with other options. A line would be one-dimensional, but z = c allows r and θ to vary, so that's two dimensions, which is a plane. A circle would be a closed curve, but here z is fixed, so it's not a circle. A sphere would require all coordinates to be fixed in some way, but here only z is fixed. A cylinder would have a fixed radius, but here r can be any value. So cylinder (D) is fixed radius, sphere (D) is different. A cone would require a relationship between r and θ, but here it's just z constant. So maybe indeed a plane.\n\nWait, but in cylindrical coordinates, the z-axis is vertical, so a horizontal plane at height c is indeed z = c. So yeah, that's a plane. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again: (C) Plane. Yep. So I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the shape described by the equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates \\((r, \\theta, z)\\), we need to consider the meaning of each coordinate. In cylindrical coordinates, \\( r \\) represents the radial distance from the \\( z \\)-axis, \\( \\theta \\) is the angular coordinate around the \\( z \\)-axis, and \\( z \\) is the height.\n\nThe equation \\( z = c \\) fixes the height at a constant value \\( c \\). This means that for any values of \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\), the height \\( z \\) remains \\( c \\). In three-dimensional space, this describes all points where the \\( z \\)-coordinate is constant, which forms a horizontal plane. \n\nComparing this with the given options, a horizontal plane is represented by the equation \\( z = c \\) in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "answer": "\\text{(C)}"}

Hmm, let me recall what I know about cross products and angles between vectors.\n\nFirst, the cross product of two vectors a and b is a vector that's perpendicular to both a and b. The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. So, maybe I can use this to find sinθ and then find θ?\n\nWait, the problem gives the cross product as a vector (3, 2, 6). So, the magnitude of the cross product would be the magnitude of that vector. Let me calculate that first. The magnitude of a vector (x, y, z) is √(x² + y² + z²). So for (3, 2, 6), that's √(3² + 2² + 6²) = √(9 + 4 + 36) = √49 = 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.\n\nGiven ||a|| = 2 and ||b|| = 7, then according to the cross product formula: 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Let's write that out:\n\n7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ\n\nSimplifying the right side: 14 sinθ = 7\n\nThen sinθ = 7 / 14 = 0.5\n\nSo θ = arcsin(0.5). The arcsin of 0.5 is 30 degrees, right? Because sin(30°) = 0.5. So that would make the angle θ = 30°. But wait, the question asks for the smallest possible angle. Is there a possibility that there's a smaller angle?\n\nWait, but in the cross product formula, the angle between the vectors is always between 0 and 180 degrees, right? Because the cross product's magnitude depends on the sine of the angle, which is positive in both the first and second quadrants. So the angle between two vectors is defined to be between 0 and 180 degrees, and the sine is positive in both cases. Therefore, arcsin(0.5) gives us 30°, which is the acute angle, and 150° is the obtuse angle. But since the cross product's magnitude is positive, we take the smallest angle between them, which is 30°. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I missed something? Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, calculate the magnitude of the cross product vector:\n\n(3)^2 + (2)^2 + (6)^2 = 9 + 4 + 36 = 49. Square root of 49 is indeed 7. Correct.\n\nThen, the formula ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. So 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Simplify: 7 = 14 sinθ => sinθ = 0.5. Yes, that's right. Then θ = arcsin(0.5) = 30° or 150°, but since the angle between two vectors is the smallest one, it's 30°. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but why is there a mention of \"smallest possible angle\"? Maybe there's a context where the cross product can imply something else? But no, the cross product only gives information about the magnitude of the sine of the angle. The direction of the cross product gives the axis of rotation, but the magnitude is determined by the sine of the angle between them. So the angle is uniquely determined by the magnitude of the cross product. Therefore, the angle must be 30°, and there's no smaller angle possible. So the answer is 30 degrees.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check using the dot product? Because sometimes cross product problems can be tricky, but here since we have both cross and dot products involved. Let me see.\n\nWe also know that the cross product magnitude is ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, and the dot product is ||a|| ||b|| cosθ. But since we only have the cross product here, maybe we don't need the dot product. But if I wanted to find the angle, I could use both. But since the problem only mentions the cross product, maybe the answer is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross product vector's direction could affect the angle? But the angle between two vectors is determined by their orientation in space, but regardless of the direction of the cross product, the angle is determined by the sine of the magnitude. So even if the cross product points in a particular direction, the angle is still determined by the sine of that magnitude. So the angle is fixed once the magnitudes of a and b are given. Therefore, the angle must be 30°, and that's the smallest possible angle.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 30 degrees. I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{30}\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 2\\), \\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = 7\\), and their cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product vector:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin \\theta\n\\]\nwe substitute the known values:\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\times 7 \\times \\sin \\theta\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n7 = 14 \\sin \\theta \\implies \\sin \\theta = \\frac{7}{14} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) whose sine is 0.5 is \\(30^\\circ\\) or \\(150^\\circ\\).

The problem is about finding the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The original function f(x) is given by x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, I need to recall how shifting a function horizontally affects its roots and consequently the sum of the roots. \n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, for f(x), the sum of its roots would be -(-49)/1 = 49. Wait, but the problem isn't asking for the sum of the roots of f(x), it's asking for the sum of the roots of g(x) = f(x + 5). So, shifting the function horizontally will shift the roots as well. \n\nBut how does shifting the function f(x) to f(x + 5) affect its roots? Let me think. If we have a function h(x) = f(x + k), then the graph of h(x) is the graph of f(x) shifted left by k units. Therefore, each root of h(x) is k less than the corresponding root of f(x). For example, if r is a root of f(x), then r - k is a root of h(x). \n\nTherefore, if the original roots of f(x) are r₁, r₂, r₃, then the roots of g(x) = f(x + 5) would be r₁ - 5, r₂ - 5, r₃ - 5. So, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r₁ + r₂ + r₃) - 15. Since the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49, subtracting 15 gives 49 - 15 = 34. So, the answer should be 34. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Maybe I should actually perform the substitution and see what happens to the polynomial g(x) = f(x + 5). Let's try expanding f(x + 5) and then apply Vieta's formula again. \n\nGiven f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Then, f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015. Let me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst, expand (x + 5)³. That's x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125. \n\nNext, expand -49(x + 5)². First, (x + 5)² is x² + 10x + 25. Multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225. \n\nThen, 623(x + 5) is 623x + 3115. \n\nFinally, subtract 2015. \n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\n(x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n- x³ term: x³.\n\n- x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².\n\n- x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x = (75 - 490 + 623)x = (75 + 623 - 490)x = (698 - 490)x = 208x.\n\n- constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015.\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\n125 - 1225 = -1100.\n\n-1100 + 3115 = 2015.\n\n2015 - 2015 = 0.\n\nSo, the constant term is 0.\n\nTherefore, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0. So, the polynomial is x³ - 34x² + 208x. \n\nTherefore, applying Vieta's formula again, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. So, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34. That matches my initial reasoning. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't want to expand the polynomial, I could use the property that shifting x by -5 in f(x) replaces each root r with r - 5, so the sum becomes (sum of roots of f) - 5*3 = 49 - 15 = 34. Either way, the answer is 34. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 34.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{34}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the roots of the function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\), we start by noting that the sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\) is given by \\(-b/a\\) using Vieta's formulas.\n\nFor the original function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \\), the sum of its roots is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{-49}{1} = 49\n\\]\n\nWhen we shift \\( f(x) \\) horizontally by 5 units, the new function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\) will have roots that are each 5 units less than the roots of \\( f(x) \\).

Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can help simplify this expression. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that there are reciprocal identities in trigonometry. For example, 1/cos²θ is the same as sec²θ. And I remember that there's an identity for sec²θ, which is 1 + tan²θ. Similarly, 1/sin²θ is csc²θ, and there's an identity for csc²θ as 1 + cot²θ. Maybe converting these into tan and cot terms could help? Let me write that down:\n\n1/cos²10° = 1 + tan²10°\n1/sin²20° = 1 + cot²20°\n1/sin²40° = 1 + cot²40°\n\nSo, substituting these into the original expression, the sum becomes:\n\n(1 + tan²10°) + (1 + cot²20°) + (1 + cot²40°)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to evaluating tan²10°, cot²20°, and cot²40°, then adding them up and adding 3. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nStarting with tan²10°. 10 degrees is a bit of a tricky angle, not one of the standard angles we usually work with. Maybe I can express 10 degrees in terms of other angles where the trigonometric functions might be related? For example, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, etc. But 10 degrees isn't directly connected to those. Alternatively, perhaps using complementary angles? Wait, 10 degrees and 80 degrees are complementary. But 80 degrees isn't a standard angle either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using double-angle or half-angle identities. Let's see. Let's consider tan10°. If I can relate tan10° to another angle where I know the tangent value, maybe through some identity. Alternatively, maybe express tan10° in terms of sin and cos. But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps using tan(3θ) formulas or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that cotθ is equal to tan(90° - θ). So cot20° is tan70°, and cot40° is tan50°. Therefore, cot²20° = tan²70° and cot²40° = tan²50°. So the expression becomes:\n\n3 + tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°, and then add 3. Hmm. Maybe there's a known identity or formula for the sum of squares of tangents at specific angles. I remember that sometimes sums of tan² terms can be related to certain trigonometric identities, especially when the angles are related in some way. For example, angles that add up to a certain value.\n\nWait, 10°, 50°, and 70°. Let's check if they add up to anything specific. 10 + 50 + 70 = 130°, which isn't a standard angle. Alternatively, maybe they are related through supplementary angles or something. Let's see. 70° is 90° - 20°, which we already saw. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(A) + tan(B) + tan(C) if A + B + C = 180°, but I don't think that applies here because the sum here is 130°, not 180°. Alternatively, maybe there's a connection with a triangle where these angles could be part of?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using complex numbers or Euler's formula? That might be a stretch, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan^2θ in terms of sin and cos. But that might not help. Alternatively, maybe express tan²θ as (sin²θ)/(cos²θ), so:\n\ntan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = (sin²10°)/(cos²10°) + (sin²50°)/(cos²50°) + (sin²70°)/(cos²70°)\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe cross-multiplying or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the angles 10°, 50°, and 70°. Let me note that 10°, 50°, and 120° add up to 180°, but 120° isn't one of the angles here. Alternatively, maybe these angles are related in some other way.\n\nWait, 10°, 50°, 70°, their supplements: 170°, 130°, 110°, which don't seem to form any particular triangle. Alternatively, maybe using multiple-angle identities. For example, tan3θ in terms of tanθ, but that might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan²θ = sec²θ - 1, which is similar to what I did before, but I already converted the original terms to that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between tan²10°, tan²50°, and tan²70°. Let me check if these angles are related in a way that allows us to use some identity. Let me recall that 10°, 50°, and 70°: 50° is 40° + 10°, 70° is 60° + 10°, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for tan(A)tan(B)tan(C) when A + B + C = 180°, but again, the angles here don't sum to 180°. Wait, 10° + 50° + 120° = 180°, but 120° isn't part of our angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the sum tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°, and trying to compute this sum. Let me see if there's an identity for the sum of squares of tangents.\n\nWait, I recall that there's an identity for tan²θ + tan²φ + tan²ψ if θ + φ + ψ = 180°, but again, the angles here don't add up to 180°. Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan²θ in terms of sin and cos:\n\ntan²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/ (1 + cos2θ) or something like that. Let me check. The identity is tan²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/(1 + cos2θ). So maybe substituting this into each term:\n\ntan²10° = (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°)\ntan²50° = (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°)\ntan²70° = (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°)\n\nSo the sum becomes:\n\n(1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°) + (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°) + (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°)\n\nHmm, that might be a way to express it, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let's compute each term numerically to see if there's a pattern.\n\nBut since the problem is likely expecting an exact value, not a decimal approximation, maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using complex numbers. Let me recall that tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, so tan²θ = sin²θ/cos²θ. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity that relates the sum of cotangents and tangents.\n\nWait, another thought: since 20°, 40°, and 10° are related by doubling angles. For example, 20° is double 10°, 40° is double 20°, but 10° is not double 40°, so maybe that's not directly helpful. But perhaps using some double-angle identities.\n\nLet me consider the first term, 1/cos²10°. Since 10° is half of 20°, so maybe expressing 1/cos²10° in terms of 20°. Let me recall that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, so 1/cos²θ = 2/(1 + cos2θ). So 1/cos²10° = 2/(1 + cos20°). Similarly, 1/sin²20° = 1/(1 - cos²20°) = 1/sin²20°, but 1/sin²20° = csc²20° = 1 + cot²20°, as before.\n\nWait, but maybe expressing all terms in terms of cos20°, cos40°, etc. Let me try.\n\nFirst term: 1/cos²10° = 2/(1 + cos20°)\n\nSecond term: 1/sin²20° = 1/(1 - cos²20°) = 1/sin²20°, but that's the same as csc²20°. Alternatively, using the identity 1/sin²θ = 1/(1 - cos²θ) = 1 + cot²θ.\n\nThird term: 1/sin²40° = 1/(1 - cos²40°) = 1 + cot²40°.\n\nBut not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use the identity for sum of 1/cos²θ and 1/sin²θ.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for the sum of sec²θ and csc²θ. Let's see. For example, if I can find a relation between sec²10° and csc²20°, but 10° and 20° are not directly related. However, 20° is double 10°, so maybe there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that 1/cos²θ + 1/sin²θ = (1 + tan²θ) + (1 + cot²θ) = 2 + tan²θ + cot²θ. But in our case, the angles are different: 10°, 20°, 40°, so that identity might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity that relates multiple angles. For example, if we consider the angles 10°, 50°, 70°, which add up to 130°, not a multiple of 90°, so not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for tan3θ. Let me recall that tan3θ = (3tanθ - tan³θ)/(1 - 3tan²θ). Maybe if we can relate tan10°, tan50°, tan70° through this identity.\n\nWait, 10°, 50°, 70°: 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which isn't a multiple of 30°, so maybe not directly. Alternatively, 50° is 3*10° + 20°, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that 50° = 60° - 10°, and 70° = 60° + 10°, so maybe using tan(60° - 10°) and tan(60° + 10°). Let me compute tan50° and tan70° in terms of tan(60° ± 10°). Let's recall the identity for tan(A ± B):\n\ntan(A ± B) = (tanA ± tanB)/(1 ∓ tanA tanB)\n\nSo tan50° = tan(60° - 10°) = (tan60° - tan10°)/(1 + tan60° tan10°)\nSimilarly, tan70° = tan(60° + 10°) = (tan60° + tan10°)/(1 - tan60° tan10°)\n\nWe know that tan60° = √3. Let's compute these:\n\ntan50° = (√3 - tan10°)/(1 + √3 tan10°)\ntan70° = (√3 + tan10°)/(1 - √3 tan10°)\n\nHmm, perhaps squaring these expressions to find tan²50° and tan²70°. Let me compute tan²50° and tan²70°.\n\nFirst, tan²50° = [(√3 - tan10°)/(1 + √3 tan10°)]²\nSimilarly, tan²70° = [(√3 + tan10°)/(1 - √3 tan10°)]²\n\nExpanding these squares:\n\ntan²50° = ( (√3 - tan10°)² ) / ( (1 + √3 tan10°)² )\nSimilarly for tan²70°.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator for tan²50°:\n\nNumerator: (√3 - tan10°)² = 3 - 2√3 tan10° + tan²10°\nDenominator: (1 + √3 tan10°)² = 1 + 2√3 tan10° + 3 tan²10°\n\nSimilarly, for tan²70°:\n\nNumerator: (√3 + tan10°)² = 3 + 2√3 tan10° + tan²10°\nDenominator: (1 - √3 tan10°)² = 1 - 2√3 tan10° + 3 tan²10°\n\nSo tan²50° + tan²70° = [ (3 - 2√3 tan10° + tan²10°)/(1 + 2√3 tan10° + 3 tan²10°) ) ] + [ (3 + 2√3 tan10° + tan²10°)/(1 - 2√3 tan10° + 3 tan²10", "answer": "12"}
{"original_question": "Quantos lados teria um polígono convexo se a soma de todos os seus ângulos internos, exceto um, for $1070^{\\circ}$?", "question": "Quantos lados teria um polígono convexo se a soma de todos os seus ângulos internos, exceto um, for $1070^{\\circ}$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking how many sides a convex polygon has if the sum of all its internal angles except one is 1070 degrees. Hmm, so normally, the sum of internal angles of a polygon with n sides is (n-2)*180 degrees. But here, they're saying that if we exclude one angle, the sum of the remaining angles is 1070 degrees. So, the total sum would be 1070 plus that one missing angle. \n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the sum of internal angles: (n-2)*180. If we subtract one angle, the remaining sum is 1070. So, (n-2)*180 - angle = 1070. Therefore, the missing angle is (n-2)*180 - 1070. \n\nBut since it's a convex polygon, all internal angles must be less than 180 degrees. So, the missing angle has to be less than 180. Therefore, (n-2)*180 - 1070 < 180. Let's write that inequality:\n\n(n-2)*180 - 1070 < 180\n\nSolving for n:\n\n(n-2)*180 < 1070 + 180\n\n(n-2)*180 < 1250\n\nDivide both sides by 180:\n\nn - 2 < 1250 / 180\n\nCalculating 1250 divided by 180. Let's see: 180*6 = 1080, so 1250 - 1080 = 170. So, 1250 / 180 = 6 + 170/180 ≈ 6.944. So, n - 2 < 6.944, which means n < 8.944. Since n must be an integer, n is at most 8. But wait, but in a convex polygon, all angles are less than 180. Also, the sum of all angles is (n-2)*180.\n\nBut also, the missing angle is (n-2)*180 - 1070. Let's compute that. Let's suppose n is 8. Then total sum is (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080. So, missing angle would be 1080 - 1070 = 10 degrees. That's okay, since 10 is less than 180. So, n=8 is possible.\n\nWait, but if n=7, total sum is (7-2)*180=5*180=900. Then missing angle would be 900 - 1070 = negative, which is impossible. So, n=7 is too small. So, n=8 is the only possible. Let me check.\n\nWait, but if n=9, total sum is (9-2)*180=7*180=1260. Then missing angle would be 1260 - 1070=190. But 190 is greater than 180, which is not allowed in a convex polygon. So, n=9 is invalid. Similarly, n=10 would give missing angle 1800 - 1070=730, which is way over 180. So, n must be 8. So, the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me verify again. For n=8, sum is 1080. If we exclude one angle, the sum is 1070, so the excluded angle is 10 degrees. Since all angles in a convex polygon must be less than 180, 10 is okay. So, that works. So, the polygon has 8 sides.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible n. Suppose n=8. Sum is 1080. If one angle is 10, the rest 7 angles sum to 1070, which is exactly the given. So, that's correct. What if n=7? Sum is 900. Then the missing angle would be 900 - 1070= -70. That's not possible. So, n=7 is invalid. For n=9, sum is 1260. Missing angle is 1260 - 1070=190, which is invalid. So, n=8 is the only possible. Therefore, the polygon has 8 sides.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe convex polygon has \\boxed{8} sides.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all its internal angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \\(n\\) sides: \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). \n\nGiven that the sum of all angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), the missing angle must be \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ - 1070^\\circ\\). Since the polygon is convex, all internal angles must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\). Therefore, the missing angle must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ - 1070^\\circ < 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ < 1250^\\circ\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn - 2 < \\frac{1250}{180} \\approx 6.944\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn < 8.944\n\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\(n\\) is 8. We check if \\(n = 8\\) satisfies the conditions:\n\n- The sum of the internal angles for \\(n = 8\\) is \\((8-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ\\).\n- The missing angle is \\(1080^\\circ - 1070^\\circ = 10^\\circ\\), which is valid as it is less than \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nChecking other values of \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(n = 7\\) or \\(n = 9\\)) results in invalid angles.

{"original_question": "Encontre o único número inteiro $\\textbf{ímpar}$ $t$ tal que $0<t<23$ e $t+2$ é o inverso de $t$ módulo $23$.", "question": "Encontre o único número inteiro $\\textbf{ímpar}$ $t$ tal que $0<t<23$ e $t+2$ é o inverso de $t$ módulo $23$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find an odd integer t between 1 and 22 such that t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23. Hmm, let me think about how inverses work. If t and 23 are coprime, then t has an inverse modulo 23. Since 23 is a prime number, any t that isn't a multiple of 23 should have an inverse. But since t is between 1 and 22, it's automatically coprime with 23, so every t in that range has an inverse. Got that.\n\nThe problem says t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23. So that means when we multiply t by (t + 2), the result should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. In equation form, that's t * (t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. Let me write that out:\n\nt(t + 2) ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nExpanding the left side gives t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23. Then, subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nt² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23\n\nSo, the equation we need to solve is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. Let's rearrange it:\n\nt² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nMaybe I can complete the square here. Let's see. To complete the square for t² + 2t, we take half of the coefficient of t, which is 1, and square it, getting 1. So:\n\nt² + 2t + 1 ≡ 1 + 1 mod 23\n\nWhich simplifies to (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23\n\nSo now the equation is (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. So we need to find t such that when we add 1 to t and square it, we get 2 modulo 23.\n\nSo essentially, we need to solve the congruence x² ≡ 2 mod 23, where x = t + 1. Then t = x - 1. So first, solve x² ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nI need to find all integers x such that x squared is congruent to 2 modulo 23. Then, subtract 1 to get t, and check if t is odd and between 1 and 22.\n\nLet me check the squares modulo 23. Let's compute x² mod 23 for x from 1 to 11, since 23 is prime, and squares are symmetric around 23/2. So if x² ≡ 2 mod 23, then (23 - x)² ≡ x² ≡ 2 mod 23. So we only need to check up to 11.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n1² = 1 mod 23 → 1\n2² = 4 mod 23 → 4\n3² = 9 mod 23 → 9\n4² = 16 mod 23 → 16\n5² = 25 mod 23 → 25 - 23 = 2\nAh, 5² ≡ 2 mod 23. So x = 5 is a solution. Then the other solution is x = 23 - 5 = 18. Let's check 18² mod 23:\n\n18² = 324. 324 divided by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 324 - 322 = 2. So 18² ≡ 2 mod 23. So yes, x = 18 is another solution.\n\nSo the solutions for x are 5 and 18. Therefore, t = x - 1. So for x = 5, t = 4. For x = 18, t = 17.\n\nBut the problem states that t must be odd and between 0 < t < 23. So t = 4 is even, so we discard that. t = 17 is odd. So 17 is the candidate.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's check if t = 17 satisfies the original condition. So t + 2 = 19. Then compute 17 * 19 mod 23.\n\n17 * 19 = 323. Dividing 323 by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. So 323 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that works. So 17 is indeed the inverse of 19 modulo 23, and 19 is 17 + 2. So that checks out.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions. We found x = 5 and 18. Then t = 4 and 17. Since t must be odd, only 17 is valid. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me check t = 17. So (17 + 2) = 19. Then 17 * 19 = 323. 323 divided by 23 is 14 with a remainder of 1. So yes, 17*19 ≡ 1 mod 23. Perfect. So that's correct.\n\nIs there any other number between 1 and 22, odd, such that t + 2 is the inverse? Let's see. Suppose I try t = 1. Then t + 2 = 3. 1*3 = 3 ≡ 3 mod 23 ≠ 1. Not good.\n\nt = 3. t + 2 = 5. 3*5 = 15 ≡ 15 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 5. t + 2 = 7. 5*7 = 35 ≡ 35 - 23 = 12 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 7. t + 2 = 9. 7*9 = 63. 63 - 2*23 = 63 - 46 = 17 ≡ 17 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 9. t + 2 = 11. 9*11 = 99. 99 - 4*23 = 99 - 92 = 7 ≡ 7 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 11. t + 2 = 13. 11*13 = 143. 143 - 6*23 = 143 - 138 = 5 ≡ 5 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 13. t + 2 = 15. 13*15 = 195. 195 - 8*23 = 195 - 184 = 11 ≡ 11 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 15. t + 2 = 17. 15*17 = 255. 255 - 11*23 = 255 - 253 = 2 ≡ 2 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 17. As before, 17*19 = 323 ≡ 1 mod 23. Good.\n\nt = 19. t + 2 = 21. 19*21 = 399. 399 - 17*23 = 399 - 391 = 8 ≡ 8 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nt = 21. t + 2 = 23 ≡ 0 mod 23. So 21*23 ≡ 0 mod 23. Not 1.\n\nSo indeed, only t = 17 works. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unique number is \\boxed{17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the unique odd integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 0 < t < 23 \\) and \\( t + 2 \\) is the inverse of \\( t \\) modulo 23, we start with the congruence:\n\n\\[\nt \\cdot (t + 2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 2t - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nCompleting the square on the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n(t + 1)^2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(t + 1)^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve \\( x^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23} \\) where \\( x = t + 1 \\).

{"original_question": "Qual é a área total da superfície, em polegadas quadradas, de um cubo com um volume de $1$ pé cúbico?", "question": "Qual é a área total da superfície, em polegadas quadradas, de um cubo com um volume de $1$ pé cúbico?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the total surface area of a cube that has a volume of 1 cubic foot. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic formulas related to cubes. \n\nFirst, the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed, right? So if the volume is 1 cubic foot, that means each edge of the cube is 1 foot long because 1 foot times 1 foot times 1 foot equals 1 cubic foot. Wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. Yeah, volume for a cube is side^3. So if volume is 1, then side length is the cube root of 1, which is 1. So each edge is 1 foot. Got that down.\n\nNow, the surface area of a cube. A cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The area of one face is side length squared. So if each face is 1 foot by 1 foot, then the area of one face is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total surface area should be 6 times 1 square foot, which is 6 square feet. But wait, the question asks for the area in square poles. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, a pole is a unit of length. I need to make sure I convert the surface area from square feet to square poles. \n\nWait, hold on. What is a pole? I'm not familiar with that unit. Let me think. A pole is a unit of length used in surveying. I think it's equal to 16.5 feet. Let me verify that. Yes, 1 pole is 16.5 feet. So, to convert feet to poles, you divide by 16.5. But since we're dealing with area, we need to convert square feet to square poles. So, 1 square pole is (16.5 feet)^2. Let me calculate that. 16.5 squared is 16.5 times 16.5. Let's compute that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 16 times 0.5 is 8, so 256 + 8 = 264 for the first part. Then 0.5 times 16 is 8, and 0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25. So adding those together: 264 + 8 + 0.25 = 272.25. So 1 square pole is 272.25 square feet. Therefore, to convert square feet to square poles, we divide by 272.25.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cube is 6 square feet. Therefore, in square poles, that would be 6 divided by 272.25. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 272.25. Let's see, 272.25 goes into 6 how many times? Well, 272.25 times 0.02 is 5.445. Hmm, maybe another way. Let's write this as a fraction. 6 / 272.25. Let me convert 272.25 into a fraction. 272.25 is the same as 272 and 1/4, which is 272 + 0.25. To convert that to an improper fraction: 272 is 272/1, so multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 1088/4. Then add 1/4: 1089/4. So 6 divided by (1089/4) is 6 * (4/1089) = 24/1089. Simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3. 24 ÷ 3 = 8, 1089 ÷ 3 = 363. So 8/363. Let's check if 8 and 363 have any common factors. 8 is 2^3, 363 is 3 × 121, which is 3 × 11^2. So no common factors. So 8/363 square poles. Wait, but 8 divided by 363 is approximately 0.02207. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion.\n\nWait, 1 pole is 16.5 feet, so 1 square pole is (16.5)^2 square feet. 16.5 squared is indeed 272.25. So 1 square pole = 272.25 square feet. So to convert 6 square feet to square poles, 6 / 272.25. Let's compute that as a decimal. 6 ÷ 272.25. Let me do this division step by step. 272.25 goes into 6.0000... how many times? 272.25 × 0.02 = 5.445. 0.02 × 272.25 = 5.445. So 272.25 × 0.02 = 5.445. Subtract that from 6.0000, we get 0.5550. Bring down a zero: 5.5500. 272.25 goes into 5.5500 about 0.02 times again? Wait, 272.25 × 0.002 = 0.5445. So 0.022 times 272.25 is approximately 5.99 (0.022 × 272.25 = 0.02 × 272.25 + 0.002 × 272.25 = 5.445 + 0.5445 = 5.9895). So 0.022 times 272.25 is approximately 5.9895, which is very close to 6. So 6 ÷ 272.25 ≈ 0.022. So approximately 0.022 square poles. But as a fraction, we have 6/272.25 = 24/1089 = 8/363 ≈ 0.02207. So the exact value is 8/363, which is approximately 0.02207 square poles.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"total surface area ... in square poles\". So perhaps they want an exact fraction or a decimal? Let me check the problem again. It says \" Qual é a área total da superfície, em polegadas quadradas, de um cubo com um volume de 1 pés cubeico?\" Translating that, it's \"What is the total surface area, in square poles, of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot?\" So they need the answer in square poles, and presumably as a numerical value, maybe as a fraction. So 8/363 is the exact value. Let me check if that can be simplified more. 8 and 363: 8 is 2^3, 363 is 3 × 11^2. No common factors, so 8/363 is simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me double-check. 1 pole = 16.5 feet. Therefore, 1 square pole = (16.5)^2 square feet. 16.5 × 16.5: 16 × 16 = 256, 16 × 0.5 = 8, 0.5 × 16 = 8, 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25. So total is 256 + 8 + 8 + 0.25 = 256 + 16 + 0.25 = 272 + 0.25 = 272.25. Yep, that's correct. So 1 square pole = 272.25 square feet. Therefore, 6 square feet = 6 / 272.25 square poles. Which is 6 divided by 272.25. Let me write that as a fraction: 6/272.25. To make this easier, multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate the decimal: 6×4=24, 272.25×4=1089. So 24/1089. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 8/363. So that's correct. So 8/363 is the exact value. If we want to write that as a decimal, it's approximately 0.02207 square poles.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of a fraction, or perhaps even a different unit conversion? Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Wait, the question is in square poles. So, if the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot, each edge is 1 foot. So surface area is 6*(1)^2 = 6 square feet. Then, converting square feet to square poles. Since 1 pole = 16.5 feet, then 1 square pole = (16.5)^2 square feet. So, 6 square feet divided by (16.5)^2 square feet per square pole. So 6 / (16.5)^2. Let me compute that. 16.5 squared is 272.25, so 6 / 272.25. Which is the same as before. So 6 divided by 272.25. Let me compute this division again. 272.25 × 0.02 = 5.445, subtract that from 6, gives 0.555. Then, 272.25 × 0.002 = 0.5445. So 0.02 + 0.002 = 0.022, gives 5.445 + 0.5445 = 5.9895. 6 - 5.9895 = 0.0105. So remaining 0.0105. So approximately 0.022 + (0.0105 / 272.25). Which is approximately 0.022 + 0.0000385 = 0.0220385. So approximately 0.022 square poles. So the answer is approximately 0.022 square poles, but the exact value is 8/363.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact answer in fraction form. Let me check. 8/363. Let me see if 363 can be simplified. 363 divided by 3 is 121. So 363 = 3 × 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 363 = 3 × 11^2. 8 is 2^3. So no common factors. So 8/363 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the initial step. Wait, the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot. So edge length is 1 foot. Surface area is 6*(1)^2 = 6 square feet. So converting 6 square feet to square poles. Since 1 pole is 16.5 feet, 1 square pole is (16.5)^2 square feet. So 6 / (16.5)^2. Let me compute that as a fraction. 16.5 is 33/2. So 16.5 squared is (33/2)^2 = 1089/4. So 6 divided by 1089/4 is 6 * 4/1089 = 24/1089 = 8/363. So yes, same result. So the exact answer is 8/363 square poles. Alternatively, if they want a decimal, approximately 0.022 square poles. But the problem says \"em polegadas quadradas\", which is square poles. So they want the answer in square poles, and probably as a fraction. Since 8/363 is the exact value, that's probably the answer they want.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe converting the edge length from feet to poles first, then compute the surface area. Let's see. The edge length is 1 foot. Since 1 pole is 16.5 feet, then 1 foot is 1/16.5 poles. Which is 2/33 poles. So the edge length in poles is 2/33 poles. Then, the area of one face is (2/33)^2 square poles. Multiply by 6 for total surface area. So 6*(2/33)^2. Let's compute that. (2/33)^2 = 4/1089. Multiply by 6: 24/1089 = 8/363. Same result. So that confirms it. So regardless of the method, we get 8/363 square poles. Therefore, that must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap: Volume of cube = 1 cubic foot => edge length = 1 foot. Surface area = 6*(1)^2 = 6 square feet. Convert square feet to square poles: 1 square pole = (16.5)^2 = 272.25 square feet. Therefore, 6 / 272.25 = 6 / (1089/4) = 24/1089 = 8/363. So the answer is 8/363 square poles. \n\nAlternatively, if I use fractions throughout: 1 foot = 1/16.5 poles = 2/33 poles. So edge length is 2/33 poles. Area per face: (2/33)^2 = 4/1089 square poles. Total surface area: 6*(4/1089) = 24/1089 = 8/363. Same result. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area is 8/363 square poles. Alternatively,", "answer": "864 \\mbox{ inches}^2"}
{"original_question": "Calcule o produto do número $5+\\sqrt{3}$ e seu conjugado radical.", "question": "Calcule o produto do número $5+\\sqrt{3}$ e seu conjugado radical.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to calculate the product of the number 5 plus the square root of 3 and its radical conjugate. Hmm, first, what exactly is a radical conjugate? I remember that in algebra, when you have a binomial expression with a radical, the conjugate is the same expression but with the sign of the radical term reversed. So, for example, the conjugate of a + b√c is a - b√c. Right? \n\nSo in this case, the number given is 5 + √3. Therefore, its radical conjugate should be 5 - √3. That makes sense. So the problem is asking for the product of (5 + √3) and (5 - √3). \n\nNow, how do I multiply these two binomials together? I think there's a formula for multiplying conjugates. Let me recall. Oh yeah, the product of (a + b)(a - b) is equal to a² - b². That's the difference of squares formula. So maybe I can apply that here instead of expanding the brackets the long way. Let me try that.\n\nHere, a would be 5 and b would be √3. So substituting into the formula, it should be (5)² - (√3)². Let me compute each term. 5 squared is 25, and (√3) squared is just 3. So subtracting those gives 25 - 3, which is 22. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check by expanding the multiplication manually to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do (5 + √3)(5 - √3). Multiply the first terms: 5*5 = 25. Then the outer terms: 5*(-√3) = -5√3. Inner terms: √3*5 = 5√3. Last terms: √3*(-√3) = - (√3)^2 = -3. \n\nNow, adding all these together: 25 -5√3 +5√3 -3. The middle terms, -5√3 and +5√3, cancel each other out. So we're left with 25 - 3, which is indeed 22. \n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the product of 5 + √3 and its radical conjugate 5 - √3 is 22. \n\nJust to recap, the key steps here were recognizing the conjugate of 5 + √3 is 5 - √3, then applying the difference of squares formula (or expanding manually and simplifying). Either way, the result is 22. I don't think I made any errors here. The terms involving the radical canceled each other out, leaving a simple numerical result. Yep, that makes sense.

Hmm, let's think. The sequence is all the positive odd integers. Each term increases by 2. So the first term is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, etc. \n\nI remember that for arithmetic sequences, the nth term can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Let me confirm that. \n\nIn this case, a_1 is 1, and the common difference d is 3 - 1 = 2. So substituting into the formula: a_n = 1 + (n - 1)*2. Let me test this with the first few terms. For n=1: 1 + (1-1)*2 = 1 + 0 = 1, which is correct. For n=2: 1 + (2-1)*2 = 1 + 2 = 3, also correct. n=3: 1 + 4 = 5, yes. So the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, to find the 2003rd term, I can plug n=2003 into the formula. Let's compute that:\n\na_2003 = 1 + (2003 - 1)*2  \n= 1 + 2002*2  \n= 1 + 4004  \n= 4005.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to think about it. \n\nSince the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7,..., each term is 2*(n) - 1. Let's test that. For n=1: 2*1 -1 =1, correct. n=2: 3, correct. n=3:5, correct. So another formula is a_n = 2n -1. \n\nThen, for n=2003: 2*2003 -1 = 4006 -1 = 4005. Same result. \n\nSo both formulas give me 4005. That seems to confirm the answer. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the sequence as starting at 1, and each term adds 2. So the first term is 1, the second is 1+2, the third is 1+2*2, the fourth is 1+2*3, etc. So in general, the nth term is 1 + 2*(n-1). Which again gives 1 + 2*(2003 -1) = 1 + 2*2002 = 1 + 4004 = 4005. \n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer. I think that's solid. \n\nBut maybe I should check with a smaller term to ensure my formula is right. Let's take the 5th term. According to the formula, 2*5 -1 =9. Let's count: 1,3,5,7,9. Yep, 5th term is 9. So that works. \n\nSimilarly, the 10th term: 2*10 -1 =19. Let's list them out up to 10 terms:\n\n1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. Yep, 10th term is 19. So the formula works. \n\nTherefore, applying it to n=2003, 2*2003 -1 = 4005. So I'm confident that's the correct answer. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is that the nth odd number is the number with the same position as n in the sequence. Since each odd number can be represented as 2n-1, that's a direct formula. So regardless of how large the term is, this formula holds. \n\nNo matter how big the term number gets, 2n-1 gives the nth odd number. So for term number 2003, it's 2*2003 -1. \n\nAlternatively, if someone doesn't remember the formula, they could derive it. Let's say you want to find the nth odd number. The first odd number is 1. Each subsequent odd number is 2 more than the previous. So starting at 1, the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7,... So the difference between each term is 2. So the sequence is an arithmetic progression with first term 1 and common difference 2. \n\nUsing the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 =1, d=2. Therefore, a_n =1 + (n-1)*2. Then, simplifying: a_n =1 +2n -2 =2n -1. So same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 4005. \n\nJust to make sure, maybe compute 2*2003 first. 2003*2: 2000*2=4000, 3*2=6, so 4000+6=4006. Then subtract 1: 4006-1=4005. Yep. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know the formula, maybe I could think in terms of pairs. For example, the first term is 1, the second term is 3, which adds up to 4. The third term is 5, which added to the next term, 7, gives 12. Wait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the sequence as numbers of the form 2k -1 where k is the term number. So for term k=1, 2*1 -1=1; term k=2, 2*2 -1=3, etc. So term k=2003 is 2*2003 -1=4005. \n\nI think that's the simplest way. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to use induction or another method, but for an arithmetic sequence, the formula is straightforward. \n\nSo, after verifying with multiple methods and checking smaller terms, I can confirm that the 2003rd term is indeed 4005. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 2003rd term is \\boxed{4005}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.

Since these are composite functions, I have to start from the inside and work my way out. So first, I need to compute f(5), right?\n\nAlright, f(x) is given as 2x - 3. So to find f(5), I substitute x with 5. Let me write that out. f(5) = 2*(5) - 3. Calculating that, 2 times 5 is 10, and 10 minus 3 is 7. So f(5) equals 7. Got that part down.\n\nNow, the problem asks for g(f(5) - 1). Since f(5) is 7, that means inside the g function, it's 7 - 1. Let me check that again. The expression is g(f(5) - 1), so first compute f(5), which we found to be 7, then subtract 1. So 7 - 1 is 6. Therefore, the input to the g function is 6. So now I need to compute g(6).\n\nOkay, g(x) is given as x + 1. So substituting x with 6, g(6) = 6 + 1, which is 7. So g(6) equals 7. Therefore, the value of g(f(5) - 1) is 7.\n\nWait, let me verify that again step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything. Starting from the inside: f(5). Plugging 5 into f(x) = 2x - 3. 2*5=10, 10-3=7. Correct. Then subtract 1: 7 -1 =6. Then plug 6 into g(x). g(6) =6 +1=7. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a composition of functions. First, f(5) is the first step, then subtract 1, then apply g. So composing functions, it's g(f(5) -1). So inside out, first f(5), then subtract 1, then g. Yep, same steps. So I think my answer is correct.

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that arctan(x) and arccot(x) are related. Maybe there's a way to simplify the expression inside the sine function.\n\nWait, arccot(1/x) is the same as arctan(x), right? Because cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so arccot(1/x) should be equal to arctan(x). Let me verify that. If θ = arccot(1/x), then cotθ = 1/x, which means tanθ = x, so θ = arctan(x). Yes, that seems correct. So arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). Therefore, the argument inside the sine becomes arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). So the equation simplifies to sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.\n\nAlright, so now I have sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3. Let me recall that sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Maybe I can use that identity here. Let θ = arctan(x). Then sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So the equation becomes 2 sinθ cosθ = 1/3. But θ is arctan(x), so sinθ and cosθ can be expressed in terms of x.\n\nIf θ = arctan(x), then we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse is sqrt(1 + x²). Therefore, sinθ = x / sqrt(1 + x²) and cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + x²). Plugging these into the equation:\n\n2 * (x / sqrt(1 + x²)) * (1 / sqrt(1 + x²)) = 1/3\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n2 * (x / (1 + x²)) = 1/3\n\nSo:\n\n2x / (1 + x²) = 1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3(1 + x²):\n\n6x = 1 + x²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx² - 6x + 1 = 0\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula gives x = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(32)] / 2 = [6 ± 4*sqrt(2)] / 2 = 3 ± 2*sqrt(2)\n\nSo the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2. But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equation. Since arctan(x) and arccot(1/x) are defined for all real x except x=0, but x=0 would make 1/x undefined. However, the original equation has arccot(1/x), so x cannot be 0. But since the solutions are 3 ± 2√2, which are both real numbers and not zero, they should be valid.\n\nBut let me double-check by plugging them back into the original equation. Let's take x = 3 + 2√2. Compute arctan(x) and arccot(1/x). Since arccot(1/x) = arctan(x), as we established earlier, the sum inside the sine is 2 arctan(x). So sin(2 arctan(x)) should equal 1/3.\n\nCompute tan(θ) = x, where θ = arctan(x). Then sin(2θ) = 2x / (1 + x²). Let's compute that with x = 3 + 2√2.\n\nFirst, compute x²: (3 + 2√2)² = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2.\n\nThen 1 + x² = 18 + 12√2.\n\nSo 2x / (1 + x²) = 2*(3 + 2√2) / (18 + 12√2) = (6 + 4√2) / (18 + 12√2). Factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2*(3 + 2√2)\nDenominator: 6*(3 + 2√2)\n\nSo simplifies to (2/6) = 1/3. So that works. Similarly, for x = 3 - 2√2, let's check:\n\nx = 3 - 2√2. x² = (3 - 2√2)^2 = 9 - 12√2 + 8 = 17 - 12√2.\n\n1 + x² = 18 - 12√2.\n\nThen 2x / (1 + x²) = 2*(3 - 2√2) / (18 - 12√2) = (6 - 4√2) / (18 - 12√2) = 2*(3 - 2√2) / 6*(3 - 2√2) = 2/6 = 1/3.

Let me start by recalling what I know about parallel lines in three-dimensional space. \n\nFirst, since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that. The direction vector for the first line is (2, -9, -2), and for the second line, it's (4, -18, -4). Hmm, if I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get (4, -18, -4), which is exactly the second direction vector. So yes, they are parallel. That makes sense. So, the lines are parallel, which means the distance between them is the shortest distance, which is perpendicular to both lines.\n\nBut how do I calculate that distance? I remember that for two skew lines (but wait, the problem says they are parallel, so they are not skew. Skew lines are non-parallel and don't intersect). So, parallel lines are either coinciding or they are two distinct parallel lines, and the distance between them is the distance between any two points on the lines minus the component along the direction. Wait, but since they are parallel, the distance is just the minimal distance between them, which can be calculated using the cross product of the direction vectors and the vector connecting a point on each line.\n\nThe formula, if I recall correctly, is: if you have two parallel lines, the distance between them is the length of the cross product of their direction vectors divided by the magnitude of the direction vector, but wait, actually, maybe it's the area of the parallelogram formed by the cross product divided by the length of the direction vector? Hmm, no, perhaps I need to use the formula for the distance between two skew lines, but since they are parallel, the formula simplifies.\n\nWait, let me check. The distance between two skew lines is |(a2 - a1) · (v1 × v2)| / |v1 × v2|, where a1 and a2 are points on each line, and v1, v2 are their direction vectors. But if the lines are parallel, then v1 × v2 is zero, which can't be. Wait, no, if they are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples, so their cross product is zero. That contradicts. Wait, but if lines are parallel, they don't have a unique distance because they extend infinitely, but the minimal distance is still defined as the distance between the closest points on the two lines. Wait, but if they are parallel, the minimal distance can be computed by taking a vector connecting any two points on the lines and finding its component perpendicular to the direction of the lines.\n\nSo, maybe the formula is |(b - a) × v| / |v|, where b and a are points on each line, and v is the direction vector. Let me verify.\n\nSuppose we have two parallel lines. Take a point a on the first line and a point b on the second line. The vector connecting them is (b - a). The direction vector of the lines is v. The distance between the lines is the length of the component of (b - a) perpendicular to v. Since the lines are parallel, this is the minimal distance. To compute this, we can take the cross product of (b - a) with v, then divide by the magnitude of v. Wait, actually, the area of the parallelogram formed by (b - a) and v is |(b - a) × v|. The base of the parallelogram is |v|, so the height, which is the distance between the lines, is |(b - a) × v| / |v|.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formula is |(b - a) × v| / |v|.\n\nSo, I need to compute the cross product of the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line with the direction vector, then take its magnitude, and divide by the magnitude of the direction vector.\n\nLet me write down the given lines again:\n\nFirst line: r1(t) = [3, -10, 1]^T + t[2, -9, -2]^T\n\nSecond line: r2(u) = [-5, -3, 6]^T + u[4, -18, -4]^T\n\nSince they are parallel, we can use the formula above.\n\nFirst, let's note that direction vector v is [2, -9, -2]^T for the first line, and for the second line, it's [4, -18, -4]^T, which is 2 times the first direction vector. So, they are scalar multiples, as we established before.\n\nNow, take a point on the first line, say when t = 0: a = [3, -10, 1]^T.\n\nTake a point on the second line, say when u = 0: b = [-5, -3, 6]^T.\n\nThen, the vector connecting a to b is b - a = [-5 - 3, -3 - (-10), 6 - 1] = [-8, 7, 5]^T.\n\nNow, compute the cross product of (b - a) and v, where v is [2, -9, -2]^T.\n\nSo, cross product (b - a) × v:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLet (b - a) = [-8, 7, 5]\n\nv = [2, -9, -2]\n\nCross product formula:\n\ni (7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) - j (-8*(-2) - 5*2) + k (-8*(-9) - 7*2)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) = (-14 + 45) = 31\n\nj: - [(-8*(-2) - 5*2)] = - [16 - 10] = -6\n\nk: (-8*(-9) - 7*2) = (72 - 14) = 58\n\nSo, cross product is [31, -6, 58]^T\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n31^2 = 961\n\n(-6)^2 = 36\n\n58^2 = 3364\n\nSum: 961 + 36 + 3364 = 961 + 36 = 997; 997 + 3364 = 4361\n\nSo, |(b - a) × v| = sqrt(4361)\n\nThen, divide by |v|.\n\nCompute |v|: sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(4 + 81 + 4) = sqrt(89)\n\nTherefore, the distance is sqrt(4361) / sqrt(89) = sqrt(4361 / 89)\n\nLet me compute 4361 divided by 89.\n\nFirst, check if 89 divides 4361.\n\n89 * 49 = 89 * 50 - 89 = 4450 - 89 = 4361\n\nYes! So 4361 / 89 = 49\n\nTherefore, sqrt(49) = 7\n\nSo, the distance between the lines is 7.\n\nWait, that's a whole number. That seems too clean. Let me verify the calculations step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, vector connecting a to b: [-8, 7, 5]. Correct.\n\nCross product with [2, -9, -2]:\n\ni component: 7*(-2) - 5*(-9) = -14 + 45 = 31. Correct.\n\nj component: - [(-8)*(-2) - 5*2] = - [16 -10] = -6. Correct.\n\nk component: (-8)*(-9) -7*2 = 72 -14 =58. Correct.\n\nSo cross product is [31, -6, 58]. Correct.\n\nMagnitude squared: 31² + (-6)² +58² = 961 +36 +3364= 4361. Correct.\n\nThen 4361 divided by 89: 89*49=4361. Correct. So sqrt(4361/89)=sqrt(49)=7. So the distance is 7.\n\nThat's a nice result. So the distance between the two parallel lines is 7 units.\n\nBut let me think again: why did the cross product divided by |v| give us the distance? Because the formula for the distance between two skew lines is |(b - a) × v| / |v|, but when the lines are parallel, they are skew lines? Wait, no. Wait, actually, if two lines are parallel, they are either coincident or parallel and non-intersecting, which in 3D space, they are considered skew if they are not coplanar? Wait, no. Wait, in three-dimensional space, two parallel lines are either coplanar (hence coinciding or parallel) or skew? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in three dimensions, two lines that are parallel must lie on the same plane. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if two lines are parallel, they are either coplanar or they are skew? Wait, no. If they are parallel, they must lie on the same plane. Let me recall: in 3D space, two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples. If they are not coplanar, then they are called skew lines. But if two lines are parallel and not coplanar, they are skew. Wait, but actually, if two lines are parallel, they are necessarily coplanar. Wait, maybe. Let me check.\n\nSuppose two lines are parallel. Then their direction vectors are scalar multiples. Suppose they are not coplanar. Then, you can have two parallel lines not lying on the same plane. For example, think of two parallel lines in different planes, but actually, in three-dimensional space, if two lines are parallel, they can be translated to lie on the same plane. Wait, perhaps they are always coplanar?\n\nWait, according to the definition, two lines are skew if they are neither parallel nor intersecting. So, parallel lines are coplanar, and skew lines are non-coplanar. Therefore, if two lines are parallel, they are coplanar. Therefore, the distance between two parallel lines is the same as the distance between two parallel lines in a plane, which is the minimal distance between a point on one line to the other line.\n\nTherefore, the formula |(b - a) × v| / |v| is valid here because even though the lines are parallel, the cross product gives the area of the parallelogram, and dividing by |v| gives the height, which is the distance between the lines.\n\nSo, since all steps check out, and the calculation leads to 7, that must be the correct answer. Therefore, the distance between the two lines is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe distance between the two lines is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the distance between the two parallel lines given by their parametric equations:\n\nFirst line: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSecond line: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\n1. **Verify the direction vectors**: The direction vector of the first line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and for the second line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\).

Let me start by understanding the problem. The rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). The question is asking for the number of integer points that lie strictly inside this rectangle. \n\nFirst, I should recall what it means for a point to be strictly inside the rectangle. I think that means the point must not lie on the boundary of the rectangle. So, if the rectangle's sides are aligned with the coordinate axes, then the interior points would have x-coordinates strictly between the leftmost and rightmost x-values, and y-coordinates strictly between the topmost and bottommost y-values.\n\nLooking at the vertices, the leftmost x-coordinate is -5, the rightmost is 5, the topmost y is 4, and the bottommost y is -4. But wait, since the rectangle is defined by these four points, the sides are vertical lines at x = -5 and x = 5, and horizontal lines at y = 4 and y = -4. \n\nBut when considering points strictly inside, we need to exclude the boundary. So, for the x-coordinate, points strictly inside would have x between -5 and 5, but not including -5 and 5. Similarly, for the y-coordinate, points strictly inside would have y between -4 and 4, but not including -4 and 4. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. The rectangle's top side is at y = 4, and the bottom side is at y = -4. So, the vertical range for y is from -4 to 4, but strictly inside would mean y must be greater than -4 and less than 4. Similarly, for x, since the left and right sides are at x = -5 and x = 5, strictly inside would mean x is greater than -5 and less than 5. \n\nTherefore, the integer points inside would have x in the range from -4 to 4 inclusive? Wait, no. If x has to be greater than -5 and less than 5, then the integer values x can take are from -4 up to 4. Because, for example, x = -5 is excluded, but x = -4 is allowed. Similarly, x = 5 is excluded, but x = 4 is allowed. So x can be -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 values. \n\nSimilarly, for y, since y must be greater than -4 and less than 4, the integer values y can take are from -3 up to 3. Let me check: if y has to be greater than -4, then the smallest integer y can be is -3 (since -4 is excluded). Similarly, the largest integer y can be is 3 (since 4 is excluded). So y can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 values. \n\nTherefore, the number of integer points would be the number of x-values multiplied by the number of y-values. So 9 x 7 = 63. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's take an example. If x is from -4 to 4 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Yes, that's 9. For y, from -3 to 3 inclusive, that's 7 numbers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So 7. 9*7 is 63. \n\nBut let me think again. The original rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4). So the rectangle spans from x = -5 to x = 5, and y = -4 to y = 4. But the interior points must not lie on these boundaries. So for x, since the rectangle's left and right sides are at x = -5 and x = 5, the interior points must have x strictly between -5 and 5. So x can be from -4 up to 4, inclusive. Similarly, for y, since the top and bottom sides are at y = 4 and y = -4, the interior points must have y strictly between -4 and 4, so y from -3 up to 3, inclusive. \n\nTherefore, the integer x-coordinates are from -4 to 4, which is 9 numbers. The integer y-coordinates are from -3 to 3, which is 7 numbers. Multiplying them gives 9*7=63. \n\nBut let me check with another method. The number of integer points strictly inside a rectangle can be calculated using the formula: (width - 2)*(height - 2). Here, width is the distance between x = -5 and x = 5, which is 10 units. Height is the distance between y = -4 and y = 4, which is 8 units. So (10 - 2)*(8 - 2) = 8*6 = 48. Wait, but that contradicts my previous answer. Hmm, which one is correct?\n\nWait, hold on. The formula (width - 2)*(height - 2) is for the number of integer points strictly inside a grid rectangle. But here, the rectangle is from x = -5 to x = 5, which is 10 units wide (from -5 to 5 inclusive), but the interior would be from -5 + 1 to 5 - 1, which is -4 to 4, which is 9 units. Similarly, for height, from y = -4 to y = 4, which is 8 units, but interior is from -3 to 3, which is 7 units. So (9)*(7)=63. \n\nBut the formula (width - 2)*(height - 2) would be (10 - 2)*(8 - 2) = 8*6=48. But why the discrepancy? Because the formula assumes that the rectangle is aligned with integer coordinates, but in this case, the original rectangle's sides are at x = -5, 5 and y = -4, 4, which are integers. So the width is 10 (from -5 to 5 inclusive), which is 10 units, but the interior points would be from -5 + 1 to 5 -1, which is 9 units. Similarly for height. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is being misapplied here. The formula (width - 2)*(height - 2) is when the rectangle is defined by integer boundaries. For example, if a rectangle is from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), where x1 and x2 are integers, then the width is x2 - x1 + 1. Then the interior points would be from x1 +1 to x2 -1, which is (x2 - x1 -1) units. So the number of interior points would be (x2 - x1 -1)*(y2 - y1 -1). \n\nIn this case, the rectangle spans from x = -5 to x =5. The width is 5 - (-5) = 10, but the number of interior points in x-direction would be 10 - 2 = 8. Wait, but if x ranges from -5 to 5 inclusive, that's 11 points. The interior points would be from -4 to 4 inclusive, which is 9 points. So 9 points in x. Similarly, y from -3 to 3 inclusive is 7 points. So 9*7=63. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the formula for the number of interior points when the rectangle is defined by integer coordinates. For example, if the rectangle is from (a, b) to (c, d) where a, b, c, d are integers, then the number of interior points is (c - a -1)*(d - b -1). \n\nIn this case, the rectangle is from x = -5 to x =5 and y = -4 to y =4. So c - a = 5 - (-5) =10, so c - a -1=9. d - b =4 - (-4)=8, so d - b -1=7. So 9*7=63. \n\nTherefore, that formula gives 63. But when I thought of (width -2)*(height -2), but width here is 10 (from -5 to 5 inclusive). So width is 10, so interior width is 10 -2=8. But that's not correct. Because the interior in x-direction is 9 units. Wait, maybe the formula is (width - 2)*(height - 2) when the rectangle is from (0,0) to (width, height). But in this case, the rectangle is not starting from (0,0). \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from different ways of defining width and height. Let me clarify. If the rectangle has left x-coordinate x1, right x-coordinate x2, top y-coordinate y2, and bottom y-coordinate y1. Then the width is x2 - x1, and the height is y2 - y1. Then the number of interior points would be (x2 - x1 -1)*(y2 - y1 -1). \n\nIn this problem, x1 = -5, x2 =5, so width is 5 - (-5)=10. So x2 - x1 -1=10 -1=9. Similarly, y1=-4, y2=4, so height is 4 - (-4)=8. So y2 - y1 -1=8 -1=7. Therefore, 9*7=63. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 63. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's list the possible x and y values. \n\nFor x, strictly inside the rectangle, x must satisfy -5 < x <5. Since x must be an integer, x can be -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 integers. \n\nFor y, strictly inside, y must satisfy -4 < y <4. Since y is an integer, y can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 integers. \n\nTherefore, the total number of integer points is 9*7=63. \n\nBut to make sure, maybe I can count them manually for a smaller case. Suppose we have a rectangle from x=-1 to x=1 and y=-1 to y=1. Then the interior points would be x=0 and y=0, so 1 point. According to the formula (width -2)*(height -2)= (2-2)*(2-2)=0*0=0. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: rectangle from x=0 to x=2 and y=0 to y=2. The interior points would be x=1 and y=1, so 1 point. The formula: (2-2)*(2-2)=0*0=0. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, in this case, the width is 2 (from 0 to 2 inclusive), so width is 2 units. But the interior points would be from 1 to1, so 1 point. The formula (width -2)*(height -2)= (2-2)*(2-2)=0. Hmm, but the formula is wrong here. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe if the rectangle is from x=a to x=b inclusive, then the number of interior points is (b - a -1). So in the case from x=0 to x=2 inclusive, interior points x=1, so 1. Similarly, y=1. So total 1*1=1. But the formula (width -2) where width is (b -a +1) gives (2 -0 +1 -2)=1. So (3 -2)=1. So maybe the formula is (width -2) where width is (b -a +1). \n\nBut in the original problem, the width is 10 units (from -5 to 5 inclusive), so width is 10. Then interior points in x-direction is 10 -2=8. Wait, but in reality, it's 9. So this seems conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because when we say width is 10 units, but the number of interior points is 9. So maybe the formula is (width -1 -1) = width -2. But in the case of x from -5 to 5 inclusive, width is 10 units. So interior points x is 10 -2=8. But in reality, it's 9. So maybe the formula is not directly applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula works when the rectangle is from (0,0) to (n, m). Then the number of interior points is (n -1)*(m -1). For example, from (0,0) to (2,2), interior points would be (1,1), which is 1. So (2 -1)*(2 -1)=1. Correct. \n\nBut in our problem, the rectangle is from (-5, -4) to (5,4). So it's not starting from (0,0). So perhaps the formula (width -2)*(height -2) works only when the rectangle is aligned with (0,0). \n\nTherefore, in this case, since the rectangle is from x=-5 to x=5, which is 10 units, but shifted left by 5, the number of interior x-coordinates is 9. Similarly, y from -4 to 4 is 8 units, shifted down by 4, so interior y-coordinates are 7. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 9*7=63. \n\nBut to cross-verify, let me consider the area of the rectangle. The area is 10*8=80. The number of interior lattice points can be approximated by the area, but the exact number is given by the formula of Pick's theorem: A = I + B/2 -1, where A is area, I is interior points, and B is boundary points. \n\nBut maybe I can use Pick's theorem here. Let's see. \n\nFirst, compute the area. The rectangle has length 10 (from x=-5 to x=5) and height 8 (from y=-4 to y=4). So area A =10*8=80. \n\nNow, B is the number of boundary points. The boundary of the rectangle consists of four sides. \n\nTop side: from (-5,4) to (5,4). The number of integer points on this side is from x", "answer": "63"}

I need to calculate the cross product of (2b - a) and (3c + a). Hmm, cross products have some distributive properties, right? So maybe I can expand this expression using the linearity of the cross product. Let me recall the formula for cross product distributivity. \n\nThe cross product is bilinear, which means it's linear in both of its arguments. So for vectors u, v, w, and scalars k and m, we have (ku + v) × (mw + n) = k m u × w + k n u × n + m v × w + m n v × n. Wait, but actually, the cross product is linear in each argument separately. So more precisely, (u + v) × w = u × w + v × w, and similarly for the other component. Also, scalar multiplication can be factored out: (k u) × v = k (u × v) = u × (k v). \n\nSo applying this to (2b - a) × (3c + a), let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, expand the first vector over the second vector:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a.\n\nSimplify the scalars:\n\n= 6 (b × c) + 2 (b × a) - 3 (a × c) - (a × a).\n\nNow, cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so a × a = 0. So that term drops out:\n\n= 6 (b × c) + 2 (b × a) - 3 (a × c).\n\nNow, note that cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that b × a = - (a × b). Similarly, let's rewrite each term using the given cross products.\n\nWe have:\n\nb × c is given as [1; -7; 18], right? The problem statement says that b × c = [1, -7, 18]^T.\n\nThen, a × c is given as [4; 7; 2]^T, so that's already in the expression.\n\nBut b × a is equal to - (a × b). And a × b is given as [6; -7; 3]^T. So b × a = - [6; -7; 3]^T = [-6; 7; -3]^T.\n\nSo substituting back into the expression:\n\n6 (b × c) + 2 (b × a) - 3 (a × c) = 6 [1; -7; 18] + 2 [-6; 7; -3] - 3 [4; 7; 2].\n\nNow, compute each of these scalar multiples:\n\nFirst term: 6 [1; -7; 18] = [6*1; 6*(-7); 6*18] = [6; -42; 108].\n\nSecond term: 2 [-6; 7; -3] = [2*(-6); 2*7; 2*(-3)] = [-12; 14; -6].\n\nThird term: -3 [4; 7; 2] = [-3*4; -3*7; -3*2] = [-12; -21; -6].\n\nNow, add these three vectors together component-wise.\n\nFirst, the x-components: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 - 12 -12 = -18.\n\nSecond, the y-components: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 +14) = -28; -28 -21 = -49.\n\nThird, the z-components: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 96.\n\nSo adding them up, the resultant vector is [-18; -49; 96].\n\nWait, let me double-check the arithmetic to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term components:\n\n6 (from 6*1), -42 (6*-7), 108 (6*18). Correct.\n\nSecond term: -12 (2*-6), 14 (2*7), -6 (2*-3). Correct.\n\nThird term: -12 (-3*4), -21 (-3*7), -6 (-3*2). Correct.\n\nAdding x: 6 -12 -12. 6 -12 is -6, then -6 -12 is -18. Correct.\n\ny: -42 +14 is -28, then -28 -21 is -49. Correct.\n\nz: 108 -6 -6. 108 -12 is 96. Correct.\n\nSo the final cross product is (-18, -49, 96). \n\nWait, but let me check if the order of the cross product is correct. Because when I expanded (2b -a) × (3c +a), I used the standard distributive property. Let me confirm that step again.\n\nYes, cross product is bilinear, so (u + v) × w = u × w + v × w, and similarly for the other component. So the expansion is correct.\n\nAlso, when I substituted b × a as - (a × b), that's correct because cross product is anti-commutative. So b × a = - (a × b), which is why we have that substitution.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo the answer should be [-18; -49; 96] in vector form, which can be written as \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the cross product \\((2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a})\\), we use the distributive properties of the cross product. \n\nFirst, expand the expression:\n\\[\n(2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a}) = 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} + 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the scalars and use the anti-commutative property of the cross product:\n\\[\n= 6 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) + 2 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a}) - 3 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c}) - 0\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given cross products:\n\\[\n= 6 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} + 2 \\left( -\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) - 3 \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCompute each term:\n\\[\n6 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\left( -\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n-3 \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAdd the vectors component-wise:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\\\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\\\ 108 - 6 - 6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]", "answer": "\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}"}

Arredonde sua resposta para o décimo de centavo mais próximo.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, Juan has this stamp collection organized by country and decade, and we need to find the average price per stamp for the 1970s. The prices are given as Brazil and France: 6 centavos each, Peru: 4 centavos each, and Spain: 5 centavos each. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the data from the Asymptote figure provided. The figure is probably a bar graph with the decades on the x-axis and the number of stamps on the y-axis, divided by countries. Let me parse the labels from the code. \n\nThe Asymptote code labels the decades as 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The countries are Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. Each decade has bars for each country. The numbers next to each bar are in the form: for 50s, Brazil has 4, France 8, Peru 6, Spain 3. For 60s: Brazil 7, France 4, Peru 4, Spain 9. Then 70s: Brazil 12, France 12, Peru 6, Spain 13. 80s: Brazil 8, France 15, Peru 10, Spain 9.\n\nSo, for the 1970s (70s), we need to find the total cost and divide by the total number of stamps. \n\nLet me confirm the numbers for 1970s. From the code:\n\n- Brazil: 12 stamps, each priced at 6 centavos.\n- France: 12 stamps, each 5 centavos.\nWait, hold on. Wait the problem says: \"Brasil e França são pontos de um mesma hostile (o Síago doJaneiro), e Perú e Esp負け são de um número de pontos ao contrário (o Síago da Avar bèa).\"\n\nHmm, maybe the price is per country? Wait, the problem says: \"O preços que ele pagou por seus stamps em uma loja de Selos were: Brazil and France, 6 centavos each, Peru 4 centavos each, and Spain 5 centavos each.\"\n\nWait, so each stamp from Brazil and France costs 6 centavos each, etc. So regardless of the country, the price per stamp is fixed. So Brazil and France each have their own bars, but each stamp in Brazil is 6, France is 6, etc.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code for the 70s says:\n\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"12\", (13.5,3.5)); // Brazil\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"12\", (13.5,2.5)); // France\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"6\", (13.5,1.5)); // Peru\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"13\", (13.5,0.5)); // Spain\n\nSo for 1970s:\n\n- Brazil: 12 stamps\n- France: 12 stamps\n- Peru: 6 stamps\n- Spain: 13 stamps\n\nSo total number of stamps in 70s is 12 + 12 + 6 + 13. Let me calculate that: 12+12=24, 24+6=30, 30+13=43. So 43 stamps in total for 1970s.\n\nNow, total cost. Each country's stamps are priced differently. So:\n\n- Brazil: 12 stamps * 6 centavos = 72 centavos\n- France: 12 stamps * 5 centavos = 60 centavos\nWait, hold on. Wait the problem says: \"Bruno e França, 6 centavos cada, Perú 4 centavos cada, e Esp )* 5 centavos cada.\"\n\nSo Brazil and France stamps are 6 centavos each, and Spain is 5 centavos each. Wait, but the problem didn't mention Perú's price. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"O preços que ele payou por seus stamps em uma loja de Selos were: Brazil and France, 6 centavos each, Peru 4 centavos each, and Spain 5 centavos each.\"\n\nAh, so Brazil and France: 6 each. Perú: 4 each. Spain: 5 each. So each country's stamps have their own price. So Brazil is 6, France 6, Peru 4, Spain 5.\n\nSo then, the total cost for 70s:\n\n- Brazil: 12 * 6 = 72\n- France: 12 * 5 = 60\n- Peru: 6 * 4 = 24\n- Spain: 13 * 5 = 65\n\nTotal cost: 72 + 60 + 24 + 65. Let me add that up step by step. 72 + 60 = 132. 132 + 24 = 156. 156 + 65 = 221. So total cost is 221 centavos.\n\nTotal number of stamps is 43. So average price per stamp is 221 / 43. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 43 * 5 = 215. So 221 - 215 = 6. So 5 + 6/43. 6 divided by 43 is approximately 0.1395. So total is approximately 5.1395 centavos.\n\nThe question says to round to the nearest tenth of a cent. So 5.1395 rounds to 5.1. Because the next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nTotal stamps: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43. Correct.\n\nTotal cost:\n\n- Brazil: 12 * 6 = 72\n- France: 12 * 5 = 60\n- Peru: 6 * 4 = 24\n- Spain: 13 * 5 = 65\n\n72 + 60 = 132; 132 +24 = 156; 156 +65 = 221. Correct.\n\n221 divided by 43. Let me do this division properly.\n\n43 goes into 221. 43*5=215. 221-215=6. So it's 5 + 6/43. 6 divided by 43. 43 into 6.0000.\n\n43 into 60 once (43*1=43), 60-43=17. Bring down a zero: 170.\n\n43*3=129. 170-129=41. Bring down a zero: 410.\n\n43*9=387. 410-387=23. Bring down a zero: 230.\n\n43*5=215. 230-215=15. Bring down a zero: 150.\n\n43*3=129. 150-129=21. Bring down a zero: 210.\n\n43*4=172. 210-172=38. Bring down a zero: 380.\n\n43*8=344. 380-344=36. Bring down a zero: 360.\n\n43*8=344. 360-344=16.\n\nSo this is getting a bit tedious, but up to this point, we have 5.1395... So approximately 5.1395 centavos. So when rounded to the nearest tenth, look at the hundredths place, which is 3. Since 3 < 5, round down. So 5.1 centavos.\n\nTherefore, the average price per stamp for the 1970s is 5.1 centavos.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I messed up the prices. The problem says Brazil and France are 6 centavos each, Peru is 4, and Spain is 5. So France is 5? The Asymptote code for France in 70s is labeled 12, which is correct. So France's price is 5 centavos each. So the total for France is indeed 12*5=60. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Spain is 5 centavos each, so 13*5=65. Correct.\n\nPeru is 4 centavos each, so 6*4=24. Correct.\n\nSo total cost is 72+60+24+65=221. Divided by 43 stamps. 221/43. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n43*5=215, 221-215=6. 6/43=0.1395... So total is 5.1395. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 5.1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.1 centavos.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average price per stamp for the 1970s is \\boxed{5.1} centavos.\n</think>\n\nTo find the average price per stamp for the 1970s, we need to calculate the total cost of all stamps from that decade and divide it by the total number of stamps.\n\nFor the 1970s:\n- **Brazil**: 12 stamps at 6 centavos each.

I need to find the area of triangle ACD in a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They also mentioned that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects the angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this first.\n\nFirst, trapezoid ABCD with AD parallel to BC. So AD and BC are the two bases. The legs are AB and CD. Now, AC is a diagonal that's perpendicular to CD. So AC ⊥ CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. That means angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. So AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD.\n\nSince the area of the trapezoid is 42, the formula for the area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = 42. But I don't know the lengths of AD, BC, or the height yet. Maybe I can express things in terms of other variables.\n\nLet me assign some variables. Let’s let AD = a, BC = b. Let’s let the height of the trapezoid (the distance between AD and BC) be h. Then, (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42. That's equation one.\n\nNow, AC is perpendicular to CD. So triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at C. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*AC*CD. But I don't know AC or CD yet. Maybe I can express AC and CD in terms of other variables.\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's consider triangle ABD. Wait, no, AC is a diagonal. So angle BAD is being bisected by AC. Let me think. Let's denote angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Then angle BAD = 2θ.\n\nSince AC is a diagonal, maybe we can use the angle bisector theorem here. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the two segments created by the bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides. Wait, but here the bisector is AC, which is not on side AB but on angle BAD. Hmm.\n\nWait, the angle bisector theorem applies when a bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But here, in the trapezoid ABCD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so maybe we can apply the theorem in triangle ABD? Wait, but ABCD is a trapezoid, not a triangle. Maybe I need to consider triangle ACD or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is right-angled at C. So maybe we can use trigonometric relations. Let me try to draw the trapezoid.\n\nImagine AD as the lower base, BC as the upper base. Then AB and CD are the legs. AC is a diagonal from A to C, which is perpendicular to CD. So point C is somewhere on BC, but since BC is parallel to AD, the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height from AD to BC. Wait, no. Wait, the height of the trapezoid is the distance between AD and BC. But AC is a diagonal, so maybe the height of the trapezoid is related to AC?\n\nWait, AC is perpendicular to CD, which is one of the legs. So in triangle ACD, which is right-angled at C, AC is the height. So the height of the trapezoid would be the same as AC? Wait, no. Because the height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the two bases AD and BC, which is a different direction. Hmm.\n\nWait, if AD is parallel to BC, then the legs AB and CD are not necessarily perpendicular to the bases. So the height of the trapezoid is the distance between AD and BC, which is different from AC. But AC is perpendicular to CD, so in triangle ACD, AC is the altitude.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, let's assume AD is along the x-axis. So point D would be at (a, 0). Then BC is parallel to AD, so it's also horizontal. Let me denote the coordinates of B and C. Since AB is a leg of the trapezoid, point B is somewhere above A. Let's say point B is at (p, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Then point C would be at (p + b, h), since BC is of length b and parallel to AD.\n\nBut wait, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and CD is the leg from C to D. Wait, CD is from point C to point D. If D is at (a, 0), and C is at (p + b, h), then CD is the vector from (p + b, h) to (a, 0). The slope of CD would be (0 - h)/(a - (p + b)) = -h/(a - p - b). But AC is perpendicular to CD. The slope of AC is from (0,0) to (p + b, h), so slope is h/(p + b). Therefore, the product of the slopes of AC and CD should be -1.\n\nSo, [h/(p + b)] * [-h/(a - p - b)] = -1.\n\nSimplify: (-h²)/[(p + b)(a - p - b)] = -1.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator: -h² = - (p + b)(a - p - b)\n\nSimplify: h² = (p + b)(a - p - b)\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's see. Angle BAD is the angle at point A between BA and DA. Since DA is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to D(a,0), and BA is from A(0,0) to B(p, h). So angle BAD is the angle between BA and the x-axis. The bisector of this angle is AC.\n\nThe angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector on the opposite side. Wait, but here, the bisector is AC, which is in triangle ABD? Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD.\n\nWait, triangle ABD has sides AB, BD, and AD. The angle at A is being bisected by AC, which meets BD at point C. Wait, but in the trapezoid, point C is on BC, which is the upper base. So maybe this is not directly applicable. Hmm, perhaps the angle bisector theorem isn't the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, since AC bisects angle BAD, the direction vector of AC should be such that the angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AC and AD. Let's compute the direction vectors.\n\nThe vector BA is from A(0,0) to B(p, h), so it's (p, h). The vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(p + b, h), so it's (p + b, h). The angle between BA and AC should be equal to the angle between AC and AD.\n\nAD is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to D(a,0), so direction vector is (a, 0). Wait, but AC is from A(0,0) to C(p + b, h), so direction vector is (p + b, h). So the angle between BA (p, h) and AC (p + b, h) should be equal to the angle between AC (p + b, h) and AD (a, 0).\n\nThe angle between two vectors u and v is given by cosθ = (u · v)/(|u||v|). So setting the cosines equal:\n\n[ (p, h) · (p + b, h) ] / [ |BA| |AC| ] = [ (p + b, h) · (a, 0) ] / [ |AC| |AD| ]\n\nSimplify numerator of left side: p(p + b) + h*h = p² + pb + h²\n\nDenominator: |BA| |AC| = sqrt(p² + h²) * sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² )\n\nRight side numerator: (p + b)*a + h*0 = a(p + b)\n\nDenominator: |AC| |AD| = sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² ) * a\n\nSo setting the two equal:\n\n[ p² + pb + h² ] / [ sqrt(p² + h²) * sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² ) ] = [ a(p + b) ] / [ sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² ) * a ]\n\nSimplify right side: [ a(p + b) ] / [ a * sqrt(...) ] = (p + b)/sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² )\n\nSo left side: [ p² + pb + h² ] / [ sqrt(p² + h²) * sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² ) ] = (p + b)/sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² )\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt( (p + b)^2 + h² ):\n\n[ p² + pb + h² ] / [ sqrt(p² + h²) ] = (p + b)\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(p² + h²):\n\np² + pb + h² = (p + b) sqrt(p² + h²)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since AC bisects angle BAD, the ratio of BA to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, maybe that's the angle bisector theorem in another form. Wait, in the angle bisector theorem, in triangle ABD, if AC is the bisector of angle BAD, then BA/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but BC is a side of the trapezoid. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so the theorem would state that BA/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but BC is not a side of triangle ABD. Hmm.\n\nWait, angle bisector theorem in triangle ABD: if AC is the bisector of angle BAD, then BA/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but BC is a side here? Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps in triangle ACD? Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the two segments created by the bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides. So in triangle ABD, if AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, then BA/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but BC is not a segment in triangle ABD. So maybe this is not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider triangle ABC? No, AC is a diagonal of the trapezoid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is right-angled. So maybe we can use some right triangle properties.\n\nLet me think. In triangle ACD, right-angled at C, so area is (1/2)*AC*CD. Also, in the trapezoid, the area is 42 = (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal, maybe we can express AC and CD in terms of the sides.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider coordinates again. Let me try to set coordinates more carefully.\n\nLet me set point A at (0, 0). Since AD is parallel to BC, let me have AD along the x-axis. So point D is at (d, 0) for some d > 0. Then, since it's a trapezoid, BC is parallel to AD, so BC is also horizontal. Let me denote the coordinates of B as (b_x, h) and C as (c_x, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Then, BC has length |c_x - b_x|, and AD has length d.\n\nNow, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(c_x, h), and it's given that AC is perpendicular to CD. CD is the segment from C(c_x, h) to D(d, 0). The slope of CD is (0 - h)/(d - c_x) = -h/(d - c_x). The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(c_x - 0) = h/c_x. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(h/c_x) * (-h/(d - c_x)) = -1\n\nMultiply left side: (-h²)/(c_x(d - c_x)) = -1\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: h²/(c_x(d - c_x)) = 1\n\nSo h² = c_x(d - c_x)\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's see. Angle BAD is the angle at A between BA and DA. DA is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to D(d,0). BA is from A(0,0) to B(b_x, h). The angle bisector is AC, which goes to C(c_x, h). So the direction vector of AC is (c_x, h). The angle between BA and AC should equal the angle between AC and AD.\n\nLet me compute the angle between BA and AC, and the angle between AC and AD.\n\nFirst, vector BA is (b_x, h), vector AC is (c_x, h), vector AD is (d, 0).\n\nThe angle between BA and AC can be found using the dot product:\n\ncosθ1 = (BA · AC)/( |BA| |AC| )\n\nBA · AC = b_x*c_x + h*h\n\n|BA| = sqrt(b_x² + h²)\n\n|AC| = sqrt(c_x² + h²)\n\nSimilarly, the angle between AC and AD:\n\ncosθ2 = (AC · AD)/( |AC| |AD| )\n\nAC · AD = c_x*d + h*0 = c_x*d\n\n|AD| = d\n\nSo cosθ2 = (c_x*d)/( sqrt(c_x² + h²)*d ) = c_x / sqrt(c_x² + h²)\n\nSince θ1 = θ2, so cosθ1 = cosθ2\n\nTherefore:\n\n(b_x*c_x + h²)/( sqrt(b_x² + h²)*sqrt(c_x² + h²) ) = c_x / sqrt(c_x² + h²)\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(c_x² + h²):\n\n(b_x*c_x + h²)/sqrt(b_x² + h²) = c_x\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(b_x² + h²):\n\nb_x*c_x + h² = c_x*sqrt(b_x² + h²)\n\nLet", "answer": "28"}

Expresse sua resposta na forma fracionária mais simples.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Alright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. There's a ratio of two square roots equal to 3 over 2. I guess the first step is to get rid of the denominators or maybe square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Hmm, squaring both sides should work. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I square both sides of the equation, that would give me \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\\). Let's compute both sides. The left side becomes \\(\\frac{2x}{3x - 1}\\) because squaring a square root just removes them. The right side is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\). So now the equation simplifies to \\(\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\nAlright, now I have a rational equation. To solve for \\(x\\), I can cross-multiply. That means multiplying both sides by \\(3x - 1\\) and 4 to eliminate the denominators. Let's do that. So, 4 times 2x equals 9 times (3x - 1). Let me write that out:\n\n\\(4 \\times 2x = 9 \\times (3x - 1)\\)\n\nSimplifying both sides. Left side is 8x, right side is 27x - 9. So now the equation is 8x = 27x - 9. Hmm, let's subtract 27x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. 8x - 27x = -9. That simplifies to -19x = -9. Then, dividing both sides by -19 gives x = (-9)/(-19) = 9/19. Wait, so x is 9/19?\n\nBut hold on, I need to check if this solution is valid in the original equation. Because sometimes when we square both sides, we can introduce extraneous solutions. So let's substitute x = 9/19 back into the original equation and see if it works.\n\nFirst, compute the left side: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x - 1}}\\). Let's plug in x = 9/19.\n\nCalculate 2x: 2*(9/19) = 18/19. So the numerator is sqrt(18/19).\n\nDenominator: 3x - 1 = 3*(9/19) - 1 = 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. So the denominator is sqrt(8/19).\n\nTherefore, the left side is sqrt(18/19)/sqrt(8/19). Let's simplify that. When you divide square roots, you can write it as sqrt(18/19 divided by 8/19) which is sqrt(18/19 * 19/8) = sqrt(18/8) = sqrt(9/4) = 3/2. Which matches the right side of the equation. So, yes, x = 9/19 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let me go through again.\n\nOriginal equation: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x - 1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Square both sides: \\(\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\\). Cross-multiplied: 8x = 27x - 9. Then, 8x - 27x = -9 => -19x = -9 => x = 9/19. Check by substitution: yes, it works. So seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the algebra when cross-multiplying. If I have \\(\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\\), cross-multiplying gives 4*2x = 9*(3x - 1). 8x = 27x - 9. Then subtract 27x: -19x = -9. Divide by -19: x = 9/19. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd the check: 2x = 18/19, 3x - 1 = 8/19. Then sqrt(18/19)/sqrt(8/19) = sqrt(18/8) = sqrt(9/4) = 3/2. Correct.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 9/19. The problem says to express the answer in the simplest fractional form, which 9/19 is already in simplest terms since 9 and 19 have no common factors other than 1. So, that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{19}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, we cross-multiply to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 2x = 9 \\cdot (3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n8x = 27x - 9\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(27x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-19x = -9\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(-19\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{19}\n\\]\n\nWe verify the solution by substituting \\(x = \\frac{9}{19}\\) back into the original equation.

So, the operation @ is defined as (m/n) @ (p/q) equals (m)(p)(q/n), right? And they want me to simplify the result of (7/30) @ (10/21). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definition correctly. The problem says that for fractions simplified (p/q), the operation @ between two fractions (m/n) and (p/q) is equal to multiplying the numerators m and p, then multiplying by (q/n). Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out:\n\nIf we have two fractions, simplified: (p/q). Then the operation @ is defined as (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). So, the first fraction is (m/n), the second is (p/q). Then, after applying the operation, it's m times p times (q/n). That seems like combining the numerators and denominators in some way. Let me check with an example if possible, but maybe that's it.\n\nSo, given that, let's apply this to (7/30) @ (10/21). Let me identify m, n, p, q here. The first fraction is 7/30, so m is 7 and n is 30. The second fraction is 10/21, so p is 10 and q is 21. According to the definition, we need to compute (m)(p)(q/n). Let's plug in those values.\n\nSo, m is 7, p is 10, q is 21, and n is 30. Therefore, substituting into the formula: 7 * 10 * (21/30). Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 7 and 10: 7*10 = 70. Then, multiply that by 21/30. So, 70 * (21/30). Let me see, 70 divided by 30 is the same as 7/3, right? Because 70 divided by 10 is 7, and 30 divided by 10 is 3. So, 70/30 simplifies to 7/3. Then, 7/3 multiplied by 21. Let's compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to simplify 21/30 first. 21 and 30 can both be divided by 3. 21 ÷3 = 7, 30 ÷3 = 10. So, 21/30 simplifies to 7/10. Therefore, the expression becomes 70 * (7/10). Then, 70 divided by 10 is 7, so 7 * 7 = 49. So, the result is 49. Wait, so 49 is an integer. Is that possible?\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, starting over: (7/30) @ (10/21) = 7 * 10 * (21/30). So, 7*10 is 70. Then, 21/30 is 0.7. So, 70 * 0.7 is 49. Yep, that's the same. Alternatively, 70 * 21 /30. Let's compute 70*21 first. 70*20=1400, 70*1=70, so total is 1470. Then, divide by 30: 1470 ÷30. 30*40=1200, 1470-1200=270. 30*9=270. So, 40+9=49. So, 1470 ÷30=49. So, yes, 49. So, the result is 49, which is an integer, so simplified form is 49/1, but since they just ask for the value simplified, it's 49. Hmm.\n\nBut let me check again if I applied the definition correctly. The operation @ is defined as (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). So, m is the numerator of the first fraction, n is the denominator of the first fraction, p is the numerator of the second fraction, q is the denominator of the second fraction. So, multiplying m*p*q/n. So, in this case, 7*10*21/30. Which is 7*10=70, 70*21=1470, 1470/30=49. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"simplified fractions (p/q)\". The first fraction is 10/21, which is already simplified. The second fraction is 7/30, which is also simplified. So, the operation is defined for fractions simplified. So, in the definition, is (p/q) the second fraction? Then, in the operation, is the first fraction (m/n) and the second (p/q). So, when you do (7/30) @ (10/21), m is 7, n is 30, p is 10, q is 21. So, the formula is m*p*q/n. So, 7*10*21/30. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the definition. Let me check again: \" defining as (m/n) @(p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n) for fractions simplified (p/q)\". So, the operation takes two fractions, (m/n) and (p/q), which are simplified, and returns (m)(p)(q/n). So, yes, that's how it's done. So, the result is 7*10*21/30. So, 7*10 is 70, 70*21 is 1470, divided by 30 is 49. So, 49. Therefore, the answer is 49. But let me check if there's a simplification step I missed.\n\nWait, 21/30 is 7/10, so 7*10*7/10. Wait, 7*10 is 70, then 70*(7/10). 70 divided by 10 is 7, so 7*7=49. So, same result. Alternatively, rearranging the multiplication: 7*10*(21/30) = 7*10*(7/10) = 7*(10*7/10) = 7*7 = 49. So, yeah, that works. So, the answer is 49.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting a fraction? The question says \"simplificada\" which is \"simplified\" in Portuguese. So, if 49 is an integer, then simplified form is 49/1. But maybe 49 is acceptable. Let me see the original problem again. It says \"o valor simplificante de (7/30) @(10/21)\". So, \"the simplified value of (7/30) @(10/21)\". So, since 49 is an integer, it's already simplified, so 49 is the answer. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let's do 7*10*21 divided by 30. Let's compute 7*10=70, 70*21=1470, 1470 divided by 30. 30*40=1200, 1470-1200=270, 270/30=9, so 40+9=49. Yep, that's right. So, 49 is the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 49, boxed as \\boxed{49}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n</think>\n\nThe operation @ is defined as \\(\\frac{m}{n} @ \\frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\\left(\\frac{q}{n}\\right)\\) for simplified fractions \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\).

Qual é a probabilidade de que os segmentos $AB$ e $CD$ se intersectem?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so the problem is about four points A, B, C, and D being chosen randomly and independently on a circle. We need to find the probability that the segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, when dealing with probabilities involving points on a circle, sometimes it's helpful to fix one point and consider the positions of the others relative to it. But since all points are chosen independently and randomly, maybe the order in which they are placed around the circle matters. Wait, but since the circle is rotationally symmetric, maybe the actual positions can be considered in terms of their angular coordinates from a fixed point. But dealing with angles might complicate things because of the circular nature. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the problem combinatorially.\n\nLet me recall that for two chords in a circle to intersect, the four endpoints must alternate around the circle. That is, if you go around the circle, you meet the points in an order like A, C, B, D or some permutation where they alternate. So, if the four points are arranged such that when you traverse the circle, you encounter A, then C, then B, then D (or any cyclic permutation of that order), then the chords AB and CD will intersect. Otherwise, if the points are arranged consecutively (like A, B, C, D or A, D, C, B), then the chords won't intersect.\n\nSo, maybe the key idea is that for two chords to intersect, the four points must be interleaved. That is, they can't all be on the same arc between A and B, or something like that. Wait, no. Let me think again. If AB and CD are chords, they intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. So, for example, if the order is A, C, B, D, then AB and CD cross each other inside the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that four randomly chosen points on a circle are arranged in such an alternating order. Now, how do we calculate that?\n\nSince all points are chosen independently and uniformly, the probability should only depend on their relative order. So, perhaps we can fix one point, say A, and then consider the positions of B, C, D relative to A. But since the circle is rotationally symmetric, we can fix A at a specific position without loss of generality. Then, the positions of B, C, D are randomly distributed around the circle.\n\nBut how do we count the number of possible orderings? Since the circle is continuous, the exact positions are determined by angles, but the relative order can be considered as a permutation. However, with four points, there are 4! = 24 possible permutations. But since the circle has rotational symmetry, some of these permutations are equivalent. Wait, actually, fixing point A, the remaining three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 different ways around the circle. But since the circle is rotationally symmetric, fixing A's position doesn't affect the probability.\n\nBut maybe instead of permutations, we can think in terms of the order of the four points. For four distinct points on a circle, there are (4-1)! = 6 possible circular permutations. Wait, circular permutations of n objects are (n-1)! So, for four points, there are 6 distinct circular orderings. But in our case, since we can traverse the circle in two directions (clockwise or counterclockwise), but the problem doesn't specify direction, so maybe each circular ordering is considered the same regardless of direction. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can fix the position of A and then consider the positions of B, C, D relative to A. Since the circle is continuous, the positions can be represented as angles between 0 and 360 degrees, but since we only care about the order, we can normalize and consider the angles as points on the interval [0,1) with 0 identified with 1.\n\nBut perhaps the key idea here is that the probability that the four points are arranged in an alternating order (like A, C, B, D) is equal to the number of such favorable orderings divided by the total number of possible orderings. However, since the circle is continuous, the exact probability isn't about permutations but about the relative positions.\n\nWait, actually, when dealing with continuous probability, the probability that four randomly chosen points on a circle have a certain order is 1/4! = 1/24, because all orderings are equally likely. But in this case, we're not looking for a specific order but an alternating order. So, how many alternating orderings are there?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we fix the order of the four points as A, B, C, D around the circle. Then, the chords AB and CD would not intersect. But if the order is A, C, B, D, then chords AB and CD intersect. Similarly, other orders where the points alternate. How many such alternating permutations are there?\n\nWait, in permutations, an alternating permutation is one where the elements alternately rise and fall. For example, for n elements, an up-down permutation starts with an increase, then a decrease, then an increase, etc. Similarly, a down-up permutation starts with a decrease, then an increase, etc. But in our case, we need the points to alternate around the circle. However, since the circle has no inherent direction, the concept of up and down might not apply directly. Wait, but in a circular arrangement, the alternation can be considered in either direction. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the four points on the circle and the two chords AB and CD. For the chords to intersect, the four points must be arranged such that one chord is \"inside\" the other? Wait, no. Actually, two chords intersect if and only if their endpoints are interleaved. That is, if the four points are arranged in the order A, C, B, D when moving around the circle, then AB and CD cross each other.\n\nSo, the key is that the four points must be interleaved. How many such interleaved arrangements are there?\n\nLet me try to count the number of interleaved permutations. Suppose we fix the position of point A. Then, the remaining three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. However, since the circle is rotationally symmetric, fixing A's position doesn't affect the probability. Now, for the points to be interleaved, the order must be such that between A and B, there is one of C or D, and between B and C, there is the remaining point, etc. So, starting from A, the next point could be C or D. Let's say it's C. Then, between C and B, we must have D. Then between B and D, we have A. Wait, but that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the four points as A, B, C, D placed in some order around the circle. For AB and CD to intersect, the points must alternate. So, the order could be A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C or similar, where between A and B there is one other point, and between B and C there is the other. Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the order around the circle is A, C, B, D. Then, chord AB connects A and B, passing through the arc that includes C and D. Chord CD connects C and D, passing through the arc that includes A and B. Therefore, the two chords cross each other inside the circle.\n\nAlternatively, if the order is A, B, C, D, then chord AB is adjacent, and chord CD is adjacent, so they don't intersect.\n\nSo, in order for AB and CD to intersect, the points must be arranged such that when you go around the circle, you encounter A, then one of C or D, then B, then the remaining one, then back to A. So, the interleaving.\n\nTherefore, starting from A, the next point is either C or D. Let's fix A's position. Then, the possible orders for the remaining three points (B, C, D) are 3! = 6 permutations. How many of these permutations result in an alternating order where A is followed by either C or D, then B, then the remaining one.\n\nWait, let's list all permutations of B, C, D after A:\n\n1. A, B, C, D\n2. A, B, D, C\n3. A, C, B, D\n4. A, C, D, B\n5. A, D, B, C\n6. A, D, C, B\n\nNow, in which of these permutations do the points alternate such that AB and CD intersect?\n\nLooking at permutation 1: A, B, C, D. Here, chord AB is adjacent, chord CD is adjacent. They don't intersect.\n\nPermutation 2: A, B, D, C. Similarly, AB is adjacent, but CD is not adjacent. Chord CD connects D and C, which are adjacent here. So, chords AB and CD don't intersect.\n\nPermutation 3: A, C, B, D. Here, starting at A, next is C, then B, then D. So, chord AB connects A and B, which are separated by C and D. Chord CD connects C and D, which are separated by B and A. So, these chords should intersect.\n\nPermutation 4: A, C, D, B. Starting at A, next is C, then D, then B. Chord AB connects A and B, separated by C and D. Chord CD connects C and D, separated by B and A. So, these should intersect.\n\nPermutation 5: A, D, B, C. Starting at A, next is D, then B, then C. Chord AB connects A and B, separated by D and C. Chord CD connects C and D, separated by B and A. So, these should intersect.\n\nPermutation 6: A, D, C, B. Starting at A, next is D, then C, then B. Chord AB connects A and B, separated by D and C. Chord CD connects C and D, separated by B and A. So, these should intersect.\n\nWait, so permutations 3, 4, 5, 6 result in intersecting chords, while permutation 1 and 2 do not. That's 4 out of 6 permutations. So, the probability would be 4/6 = 2/3? Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, hold on. But in this analysis, we fixed the position of A and considered the permutations of B, C, D after A. However, in reality, the circle is rotationally symmetric, so fixing A's position is valid. But the problem states that all four points are chosen independently. Wait, but if all four points are chosen, then the order isn't fixed. Wait, perhaps the approach of fixing A's position is not valid here because in reality, all four points are randomly placed, so we can't fix one of them.\n\nWait, maybe my mistake was in fixing A's position. Because in reality, all four points are indistinct. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the four points as a random permutation. However, on a circle, the concept of a permutation is a bit different because of rotational symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the four points as distinct and randomly placed, and then compute the probability based on their order. Let's suppose we fix the circle and label the points in the order they are placed around the circle. However, since the circle has no inherent direction, the arrangement is a random permutation.\n\nWait, here's another approach. For four distinct points on a circle, the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect is equal to the number of intersecting configurations divided by the total number of configurations. Since the points are chosen independently, the total number of configurations is 1 (since it's a continuous circle, but actually, the probability is determined by the relative orderings).\n\nWait, but in continuous probability, the probability that two chords intersect is actually 1/3. Wait, is that the case? Wait, no, I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard result: for four random points on a circle, the probability that the two chords AB and CD intersect is 1/3. How is that derived?\n\nWell, consider that once the four points are chosen, the two chords intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order (A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C etc.), which is half of the possible orderings. Wait, but how many orderings are there?\n\nWait, if we fix the order of the four points around the circle, there are 4! = 24 possible orderings. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, we can fix one point, say A, and then consider the order of the other three points. So, fixing A, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of B, C, D. For the chords AB and CD to intersect, the order must be such that C and D are interleaved with B. That is, after A, the next point is either C or D, then B, then the remaining one.\n\nSo, in the fixed order starting with A, the possible interleaved orders are:\n\nA, C, B, D\n\nA, D, B, C\n\nA, B, C, D (no intersection)\n\nA, B, D, C (no intersection)\n\nA, C, D, B (no intersection)\n\nA, D, C, B (no intersection)\n\nWait, but hold on, in this case, only two of the six orderings result in intersection. So, the probability would be 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, by fixing point A, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the remaining three points. For the chords AB and CD to intersect, the points must be ordered such that either C and D are interleaved with B. That is, the order must be A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. So, two favorable orderings out of six, hence probability 1/3.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that once the four points are on the circle, the two chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order. The number of such alternating orderings is 2 * (number of ways to choose which point is opposite). Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Imagine choosing four points on the circle. The probability that AB and CD intersect is the same as the probability that, given four random points, the chords AB and CD cross each other. Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, we can assume that all four points are distinct with probability 1.\n\nNow, fix the positions of the four points. Let's label them in the order they appear around the circle as P1, P2, P3, P4. Then, the chords P1P3 and P2P4 will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order.

I have two circles, both with center D, radii 1 and 2. The total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC. Hmm, wait, angle ADC... Since both circles have the same center D, points A, C, and D must form a triangle? Or maybe they are points on the circles? Wait, the problem mentions regions shaded, so maybe the shaded regions are segments or something like that. Let me visualize this.\n\nIf the circles are concentric (same center), then the area between them would be an annulus. But the problem mentions the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. So 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So the shaded area is 5/3 π.\n\nBut how is this shaded area formed? Since there are two circles, maybe the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle? If that's the case, then the area would be (θ/360)*(π*(2)^2) - (θ/360)*(π*(1)^2) = (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. So setting that equal to 5/3 π:\n\n(θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π\n\nDivide both sides by π: (θ/360)*3 = 5/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 360: θ = (5/3)*360 /3 = (5/3)*120 = 200 degrees.\n\nBut wait, 200 degrees is more than 180, so maybe that's the reflex angle. But the problem asks for the smaller angle ADC. So if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees? But that seems contradictory. Wait, but if the shaded area is the region between the two circles, then the angle given is the angle for the annulus sector, which would correspond to the angle of the sector. But if the angle is 200 degrees, then the shaded area is a major sector, but the problem mentions the smaller angle. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is a segment? Wait, but the problem says \"a kindly diagram\" but since there's no diagram, I have to imagine. Maybe the two circles are overlapping, but since they have the same center, they are concentric. So overlapping is not possible unless they are the same circle. Wait, no. Wait, two concentric circles with radii 1 and 2. So the smaller circle is entirely inside the larger one, right? So the area between them is the annulus. But the problem says the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is 4π, so 5/12 of that is 5π/3. The area of the annulus is 3π, so 5π/3 is more than the annulus. That can't be. Wait, that's a problem. So this suggests that maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the shaded area is not the entire annulus. Maybe it's a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, but not the entire annulus. So if the angle is θ, then the area would be (θ/360)*(π*2² - π*1²) = (θ/360)*(3π). Then set that equal to 5π/3. So (θ/360)*3π = 5π/3. Then θ = (5π/3)/(3π) *360 = (5/9)*360 = 200 degrees. But again, 200 degrees is the angle for the annulus sector. But the problem mentions the smaller angle ADC. If angle ADC is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle would be 160 degrees. But 160 is not among the options? Wait, the problem doesn't give options, so maybe 200 degrees is the answer? But the problem says \"the smaller angle ADC\". So maybe there's a different configuration.\n\nWait, maybe the shaded area is a combination of segments from both circles. For example, if points A and C are on the larger circle, and D is the center, then angle ADC is the central angle for a sector of the larger circle. But if parts of the shaded area are from the smaller circle, maybe subtracting a segment from the smaller circle. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle. Let me think. If angle ADC is θ degrees, then the area of the sector of the larger circle would be (θ/360)*π*2² = (θ/360)*4π. The area of the sector of the smaller circle would be (θ/360)*π*1² = (θ/360)*π. Then the area between them would be (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. If the shaded area is this region, then as before, (θ/360)*3π = 5π/3, leading to θ = 200 degrees. But again, 200 is more than 180, so the smaller angle would be 160. But the problem says \"the smaller angle ADC\". So maybe the answer is 160 degrees? But 160 isn't a standard angle. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let's check the problem again. It says \"a общая (comum) center D, têm raios de 1 e 2\". So two circles with center D, radii 1 and 2. The total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So the area of the larger circle is 4π, so 5/12 of that is 5π/3. The shaded area is 5π/3. The annulus area is 3π, which is less than 5π/3 (which is approximately 5.23, and 3π is approximately 9.42). Wait, 5π/3 is about 5.23, which is less than 3π. So maybe the shaded area is not the annulus. Wait, 5π/3 is about 5.23, which is more than the area of the smaller circle, which is π*1²=π≈3.14. Hmm, but how can the shaded area be more than the area of the smaller circle? If it's a combination.\n\nWait, maybe the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle plus a sector of the smaller circle? But then the total area would be (θ/360)*(4π + π) = (θ/360)*5π. Then setting that equal to 5π/3: (θ/360)*5π = 5π/3 ⇒ θ = (5π/3)/(5π) *360 = (1/3)*360 = 120 degrees. So angle ADC would be 120 degrees. But 120 is a common angle. So maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut why would the shaded area be the sum of the sectors? The problem says \"aária totalda outsidersa sombreada é 5/12 da area do círculo maial\". So \"total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle\". If the shaded region is a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle, then the total area would be 5/12 of the larger circle's area. Let me check:\n\nArea of the larger circle is 4π. 5/12 of that is 5π/3. If the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle (angle θ) plus a sector of the smaller circle (angle θ), then the area would be (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*5π. Setting that equal to 5π/3: (θ/360)*5π = 5π/3 ⇒ θ = (5π/3)/(5π) *360 = 120. So θ=120 degrees. That seems plausible.\n\nBut why would the shaded area be the sum of two sectors? The problem mentions \"a蜚 2 círculos, cada um com center D, têm raios de 1 e 2\". So maybe the shaded region is a sector of the larger circle overlapping with a sector of the smaller circle? Hmm, but since they are concentric, if you take a sector from the larger circle, it would naturally include the smaller circle's sector. Wait, but if you take a sector of the larger circle and subtract the sector of the smaller circle, that's the annulus sector. But if you add them, it's the area of the larger sector plus the smaller sector. So depending on the configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area of the larger sector plus the area of the smaller circle. But the problem says \"the total shaded area\", so perhaps it's a combination. Wait, but the answer 120 degrees is a common angle. Let me check if 120 degrees is correct.\n\nIf the angle is 120 degrees, then the sector area of the larger circle is (120/360)*4π = (1/3)*4π = 4π/3. The sector area of the smaller circle is (120/360)*π = π/3. So total shaded area would be 4π/3 + π/3 = 5π/3, which is 5/12 of the larger circle's area (5/12*4π=5π/3). So that works. Therefore, the angle is 120 degrees. But the problem says \"aieveis 2 círculos, cadaum com center D, têm raios de 1 e 2\". So maybe the shaded area is the larger sector plus the smaller sector. But how would that look? If you have a sector of the larger circle (120 degrees) and a sector of the smaller circle (120 degrees), but since they are concentric, if the sectors are in the same angle, then the shaded area would be the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector, which is 4π/3 - π/3 = 3π/3 = π. But π is not equal to 5π/3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, if the shaded area is the sum of the two sectors, then as calculated earlier, it would be 5π/3. But how can that be? If you have a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle, but they are separate regions? But since both circles are centered at D, if you take a sector from the larger circle and another sector from the smaller circle, but the problem states \"the total shaded area\", so maybe overlapping regions? Hmm, this is confusing without the diagram.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the union of two sectors: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. But since they are concentric, the union would just be the larger sector. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the sectors are in different angles. Wait, but the problem mentions angle ADC, which is a single angle. So maybe the shaded area is a combination of two sectors with angle ADC each, but from different circles.\n\nWait, maybe the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. Then the area would be (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. If this is equal to 5π/3, then θ = (5π/3)/(3π)*360 = (5/9)*360 = 200 degrees, which would make the smaller angle 160 degrees. But the problem mentions the smaller angle ADC. So if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would be 160. But 160 is not a standard answer. Wait, maybe the problem is in Spanish. \"a—ativa 2 círculos, cadaum com center D, têm raios de 1 e 2\". Maybe \"a—a\" is a typo. Maybe it's \"dois círculos\".\n\nAssuming it's two circles, radii 1 and 2, same center D. The shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle. So area is 5π/3. If the shaded area is the larger sector minus the smaller sector, then θ is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160. But the problem asks for the smaller angle, so maybe 160. But 160 is a possible answer. Wait, but why would the angle be 160?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the smaller sector plus the larger sector? But that would be 5π/3. Wait, but 5π/3 is more than the area of the larger circle. No, the larger circle is 4π. 5π/3 is less than 4π. Wait, but if the shaded area is a combination of a sector from the larger circle and a sector from the smaller circle, but arranged such that they add up to 5π/3. Wait, if angle ADC is θ, then the area would be (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π = 5πθ/360. Setting equal to 5π/3, so 5πθ/360 = 5π/3 ⇒ θ= (5π/3)/(5π/360) )= (5π/3)*(360/(5π)) )= 360/3 = 120. So θ=120. So angle ADC is 120 degrees, which is the smaller angle. Because 120 is less than 180. So maybe the answer is 120 degrees.\n\nBut then why would the problem mention the smaller angle if it's already 120? Wait, 120 is less than 180, so it's already the smaller angle. Wait, 120 is less than 180, so yes. So maybe the answer is 120 degrees. But then why did the initial calculation give ", "answer": "120"}

Quantos desses béqueres de água serão necessários para encher um tanque esférico com raio de 6 cm?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how many cylindrical pitchers are needed to fill a spherical tank. Hmm, first I need to remember the formulas for the volumes of a cylinder and a sphere. \n\nThe problem states that each cylindrical pitcher has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm. The spherical tank has a radius of 6 cm. So, I need to calculate the volume of one pitcher and then see how many of them fit into the volume of the spherical tank.\n\nStarting with the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is π times the radius squared times the height. So, plugging in the numbers: radius is 3 cm, height is 8 cm. Therefore, the volume of one pitcher is π * (3)^2 * 8. Let me compute that. 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 8 is 72. So, each pitcher has a volume of 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, the spherical tank. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)π times the radius cubed. The radius here is 6 cm. So, substituting that in: (4/3)π * (6)^3. Let me calculate that step by step. 6 cubed is 216. Then, 4/3 times 216. Hmm, 216 divided by 3 is 72, multiplied by 4 is 288. So, the volume of the spherical tank is 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, to find out how many pitchers are needed, I need to divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one pitcher. That should give the number of pitchers required. So, 288π divided by 72π. The π terms cancel out, leaving 288 divided by 72. Let me do that division. 72 times 4 is 288. So, 288 divided by 72 is 4.\n\nWait a second, so does that mean exactly 4 pitchers are needed to fill the spherical tank? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. \n\nFirst, checking the cylinder volume again: radius 3 cm, height 8 cm. 3 squared is 9, 9 times 8 is 72, times π. Correct. Sphere volume: radius 6 cm. 6 cubed is 216, times 4/3 is 288, times π. Correct. Dividing 288 by 72 gives 4. So, 4 pitchers. \n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any rounding or if the division isn't exact? But since both volumes are in terms of π, when we divide them, π cancels out, so there's no approximation needed here. The answer should be exact. \n\nTherefore, the number of cylindrical pitchers required is 4. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The key was remembering the formulas and substituting the correct values. The units are all in centimeters, so the volumes are in cubic centimeters, which makes sense. Dividing them gives a pure number, which is the count of pitchers. So, yeah, 4 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical pitchers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we calculate their volumes and divide:\n\n1. **Volume of one cylindrical pitcher**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the spherical tank**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of pitchers needed**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cylinder}}} = \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = \\frac{288}{72} = 4\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{4}", "answer": "4"}

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that arcsin is the inverse function of sine, so arcsin 0.4 is an angle whose sine is 0.4, and similarly, arcsin 0.5 is an angle whose sine is 0.5. Let me denote these angles to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet α = arcsin 0.4, so sin α = 0.4\n\nLet β = arcsin 0.5, so sin β = 0.5\n\nThen the problem is asking for sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). So, I need to compute sin(α + β) and sin(β - α), then multiply them together.\n\nI recall that there are sine addition and subtraction formulas. Let me recall them:\n\nsin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β\n\nsin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos α sin β\n\nYes, that's right. So, if I can compute sin α, cos α, sin β, cos β, then I can plug into these formulas.\n\nGiven that sin α = 0.4 and sin β = 0.5, I can find cos α and cos β using the Pythagorean identity: cos θ = sqrt(1 - sin² θ). But wait, I need to be careful about the angle's quadrant. However, since arcsin returns angles in the range [-π/2, π/2], which is the range where cosine is non-negative. So, cos α and cos β will both be positive.\n\nTherefore, cos α = sqrt(1 - 0.4²) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165\n\nSimilarly, cos β = sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660\n\nWait, let me check those calculations again. \n\nFor cos α:\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.4²) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84). Hmm, sqrt(0.84) is approximately 0.9165? Let me verify. \n\nYes, 0.9165 squared is approximately 0.84. Let's compute 0.9165^2:\n\n0.9^2 = 0.81, 0.0165^2 ≈ 0.000272, and cross term 2*0.9*0.0165 ≈ 0.0297. So total ≈ 0.81 + 0.0297 + 0.000272 ≈ 0.839972, which is roughly 0.84. So, yes, cos α ≈ 0.9165.\n\nSimilarly, cos β = sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Correct.\n\nSo, sin α = 0.4, cos α ≈ 0.9165\n\nsin β = 0.5, cos β ≈ 0.8660\n\nNow, let's compute sin(α + β):\n\nsin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n= 0.4 * 0.8660 + 0.9165 * 0.5\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n0.4 * 0.8660 = 0.3464\n\n0.9165 * 0.5 = 0.45825\n\nAdding these together: 0.3464 + 0.45825 = 0.80465\n\nSo, sin(α + β) ≈ 0.80465\n\nNow, sin(β - α):\n\nsin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n= 0.5 * 0.9165 - 0.8660 * 0.4\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.5 * 0.9165 = 0.45825\n\n0.8660 * 0.4 = 0.3464\n\nSubtracting these: 0.45825 - 0.3464 = 0.11185\n\nSo, sin(β - α) ≈ 0.11185\n\nTherefore, the product sin(α + β) * sin(β - α) ≈ 0.80465 * 0.11185\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.8 * 0.11185 = 0.08948\n\nThen, 0.00465 * 0.11185 ≈ 0.000519\n\nAdding them together: 0.08948 + 0.000519 ≈ 0.089999, which is approximately 0.09\n\nWait, that seems too clean. Hmm, maybe there's an exact value here?\n\nWait, let's check again. Let me recast the problem using exact terms instead of approximate decimals to see if it simplifies.\n\nGiven that sin α = 0.4 = 2/5, and sin β = 0.5 = 1/2.\n\nSo, cos α = sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 0.9165\n\nSimilarly, cos β = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nSo, sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β = (2/5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(21)/5)(1/2)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (2/5)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/5)\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(21)/5)(1/2) = sqrt(21)/10\n\nSo, sin(α + β) = sqrt(3)/5 + sqrt(21)/10 = (2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(21)) / 10\n\nSimilarly, sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α = (1/2)(sqrt(21)/5) - (sqrt(3)/2)(2/5)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(sqrt(21)/5) = sqrt(21)/10\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2)(2/5) = sqrt(3)/5\n\nSo, sin(β - α) = sqrt(21)/10 - sqrt(3)/5 = (sqrt(21) - 2 sqrt(3))/10\n\nTherefore, the product sin(α + β) * sin(β - α) = [(2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(21))/10] * [(sqrt(21) - 2 sqrt(3))/10]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(21))(sqrt(21) - 2 sqrt(3))\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n2 sqrt(3) * sqrt(21) = 2 sqrt(63) = 2 * 3 sqrt(7) = 6 sqrt(7)\n\n2 sqrt(3) * (-2 sqrt(3)) = -4 * 3 = -12\n\nsqrt(21) * sqrt(21) = 21\n\nsqrt(21) * (-2 sqrt(3)) = -2 sqrt(63) = -2 * 3 sqrt(7) = -6 sqrt(7)\n\nSo, adding all terms together:\n\n6 sqrt(7) - 12 + 21 - 6 sqrt(7) = (6 sqrt(7) - 6 sqrt(7)) + (-12 + 21) = 0 + 9 = 9\n\nDenominator: 10 * 10 = 100\n\nTherefore, the product is 9 / 100 = 0.09\n\nOh! So even though the approximate calculation gave me roughly 0.09, the exact value is 9/100, which is 0.09. That's a nice number. So, the answer is 9/100.\n\nWait, so that's interesting. The product simplifies to 9/100. Let me check that again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, expanding the numerator:\n\n(2√3 + √21)(√21 - 2√3)\n\nFirst term: 2√3 * √21 = 2 * √(3*21) = 2 * √63 = 2 * 3√7 = 6√7\n\nSecond term: 2√3 * (-2√3) = -4 * (√3)^2 = -4 * 3 = -12\n\nThird term: √21 * √21 = (√21)^2 = 21\n\nFourth term: √21 * (-2√3) = -2 * √(21*3) = -2 * √63 = -2 * 3√7 = -6√7\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n6√7 -12 +21 -6√7 = (6√7 -6√7) + (-12 +21) = 0 +9 =9\n\nYes, that's correct. So numerator is 9, denominator is 100. So, 9/100. \n\nTherefore, the exact value is 9/100. So, the answer is 9/100, which is 0.09. \n\nSo, even though the problem looked like it might require some messy decimal calculations, it actually simplifies neatly if we work with exact values. That's reassuring. \n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Let α = arcsin 0.4 and β = arcsin 0.5, so we need to compute sin(α + β) * sin(β - α).\n\n2. Use sine addition and subtraction formulas, which require knowing sin α, cos α, sin β, cos β.\n\n3. Since arcsin gives angles in the first quadrant (since 0.4 and 0.5 are positive), cosines are positive, so we can compute them via sqrt(1 - sin²).\n\n4. Plug into the formulas for sin(α + β) and sin(β - α), multiply those expressions together, and simplify.\n\n5. When multiplying out, the cross terms involving sqrt(7) cancel each other, leading to a simple numerator of 9 and denominator of 100.\n\nSo, the final answer is 9/100. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using trigonometric identities or another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. But in this case, since we have sin(α + β) sin(β - α), which is sin C sin D where C = α + β and D = β - α. Then, using the identity:\n\nsin C sin D = [cos(C - D) - cos(C + D)] / 2\n\nCompute C - D = (α + β) - (β - α) = 2α\n\nC + D = (α + β) + (β - α) = 2β\n\nTherefore, sin C sin D = [cos(2α) - cos(2β)] / 2\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\nsin(α + β) sin(β - α) = [cos(2α) - cos(2β)] / 2\n\nNow, compute cos(2α) and cos(2β) using double-angle formulas.\n\ncos(2α) = 1 - 2 sin² α = 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2*0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\ncos(2β) = 1 - 2 sin² β = 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2*0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, [cos(2α) - cos(2β)] / 2 = (0.68 - 0.5)/2 = 0.18/2 = 0.09 = 9/100\n\nSo, same result! Therefore, confirming that the answer is indeed 9/100. This method seems more straightforward. Instead of expanding the product directly, using the identity for sin A sin B and then applying double-angle formulas gives the same result with less computation. \n\nSo, either way, the answer is 9/100. Therefore, the problem simplifies nicely using trigonometric identities, and the exact value is 9/100. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just verify once more that I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in the first method. The first method required expanding the product of two binomials with radicals, which led to cancellation and a clean 9. The second method was much quicker with the identity. Both approaches lead to the same answer, so that gives me confidence. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 9/100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem \\(\\sin (\\arcsin 0.4 + \\arcsin 0.5) \\cdot \\sin (\\arcsin 0.5 - \\arcsin 0.4)\\), we start by letting \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\).

Qual é a velocidade da bicicleta expressa em polegadas por segundo?", "question": "Uma bicicleta está viajando a 20 pés por minuto. Qual é a velocidade da bicicleta expressa em polegadas por segundo?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about converting the speed of a bicycle from paces per minute to polegadas per second. Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand the units involved here. \n\nSo, the bicycle is moving at 20 paces per minute. I need to convert that to polegadas per second. I think \"aces\" and \"polegadas\" are both units of length, right? I remember that \"pace\" might be a unit based on the person's step, and \"polegada\" is a Portuguese word for inch, right? So, polegada is an inch. Let me confirm that. Yeah, polegada in Portuguese is equivalent to inch in English. So, 1 polegada = 1 inch. \n\nFirst, I need to convert paces to inches, and then convert the time from minutes to seconds. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nThe given speed is 20 paces per minute. To convert this to inches per minute, I need to know how many inches are in a pace. Wait, the problem doesn't specify how many inches are in a pace. Hmm, maybe I need to assume a standard conversion? Or perhaps there's a standard definition for a pace here. \n\nWait, in some contexts, a pace is considered to be the distance covered in one step. But the exact length can vary. However, since this is a math problem, maybe they define a pace in terms of polegadas (inches) explicitly. But the problem doesn't mention that. Wait, maybe I need to look up standard conversions? Wait, but since this is a problem from a math competition or textbook, they might expect me to know that a pace is, for example, 100 inches or 25.4 inches? Wait, 25.4 is a meter, no. Wait, actually, in the metric system, a meter is 100 centimeters, so 1 meter is 1000 millimeters. But inches are a different unit. 1 inch is 2.54 centimeters. So, 1 foot is 12 inches, 1 yard is 3 feet. \n\nWait, but in this case, since the target unit is polegada (inch), maybe they define a pace in inches. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is using \"pace\" as a unit equivalent to a certain number of inches. But without that information, I can't proceed. Wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is expecting me to use a conversion factor between paces and polegadas. But since the problem didn't provide that, perhaps there's a standard one? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem is in Portuguese, and \"pace\" is \" passo\" in Portuguese, which is a step. So, perhaps in the context of the problem, a pace is defined as, say, 10 polegadas. But since I don't have that information, maybe I need to make an assumption. Wait, but this is a problem from a math competition or textbook, so maybe they use a standard conversion. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to use 1 pace = 100 polegadas? Wait, but 100 polegadas would be 100 inches, which is about 2.54 meters. That seems too long for a step. Alternatively, maybe 1 pace = 10 polegadas, which is 10 inches, which is 0.254 meters. That still seems a bit short for a step. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the standard conversion factor where 1 pace is equal to 100 centimeters. Then, since 1 inch is 2.54 cm, 100 cm is 39.37 inches. So, 1 pace = 39.37 polegadas. But again, that might not be standard. Alternatively, maybe in the problem's context, a pace is defined as 10 polegadas. But without explicit information, this is tricky. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the fact that 1 meter is 3.28084 feet, and 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 meter is 39.37 inches. Therefore, 1 pace (if 1 meter is 10 paces) would be 3.937 inches. But that's even more complicated.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe the problem is written in a way that \"pace\" is a standard unit. Wait, but since it's not specified, maybe the answer is expected to be in terms of polegadas per second, assuming that 1 pace = 100 polegadas. Let me check that. If 1 pace = 100 polegadas, then 20 paces = 2000 polegadas. Then, per minute, so 2000 polegadas per minute. Then, convert minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds, so 2000 / 60 = 33.333... polegadas per second. But that seems like a lot. 33.33 inches per second is about 5.55 feet per second, which is really fast for a bicycle. A typical bicycle speed is around 15-20 mph, which is about 20-25 feet per second. Wait, 20 feet per second is about 2.4 meters per second, which is slow for a bicycle. Wait, no, 20 feet per second is actually about 12 km/h, which is very slow. Wait, maybe I messed up the units.\n\nWait, 1 foot per second is about 0.6818 meters per second. So, 20 feet per second is 13.64 meters per second, which is about 50 mph. Wait, 50 mph is a decent cycling speed. Wait, but 2.54 meters per second is about 9.32 feet per second. Wait, no, 1 m/s is about 3.2808 feet per second. So, 10 m/s is 32.808 feet per second, which is 22.36 mph. Wait, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, 20 paces per minute. If each pace is, say, 2.54 meters (1 foot), then 20 paces would be 50.8 meters per minute. Then, converting to meters per second: 50.8 / 60 = 0.8467 meters per second. Then, converting meters to polegadas: 1 meter is 39.37 inches. So, 0.8467 m/s * 39.37 in/m = approximately 33.33 inches per second. Wait, but that's the same as before. So, 33.33 inches per second. Hmm. But that's equivalent to about 2.7778 feet per second. Which is a reasonable cycling speed. 2.7778 ft/s is 18.63 km/h, which is a typical speed for a bicycle. Wait, 18.63 km/h is about 11.57 mph. That seems a bit slow for a bicycle. Wait, but 20 paces per minute is 20 steps per minute. If each step is about 0.5 meters, then 20*0.5=10 meters per minute, which is 0.1667 meters per second, which is 0.5468 feet per second, which is 0.6366 miles per hour. That's very slow. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is in a different unit system.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using \"pace\" as a different unit. Wait, maybe in the problem's context, 1 pace = 10 polegadas. So, 10 polegadas per pace. Then 20 paces per minute would be 200 polegadas per minute. Convert to polegadas per second: 200 / 60 ≈ 3.333... polegadas per second. But 3.333 inches per second is about 0.2778 feet per second, which is very slow. So, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if 1 pace = 100 polegadas, then 20 paces per minute is 2000 polegadas per minute, which is 33.333 polegadas per second. But that's 33.33 inches per second, which is about 2.78 feet per second. That's a reasonable cycling speed. Wait, but 2.78 feet per second is 18.64 km/h, which is about 11.57 mph. That's a slow bicycle speed. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different conversion. Wait, but the problem is in Portuguese. Let me check if \"pace\" in Portuguese is equivalent to something else.\n\nWait, \"pace\" in Portuguese is \"passo\", which is a step. The term \"passo\" can sometimes be used to mean a unit of length, similar to a step. In some contexts, a \"passo\" is considered to be 1 meter, but in other contexts, it's 0.76 meters. However, without specific information, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe in this problem, \"pace\" is defined as 100 polegadas (inches). If that's the case, then 20 paces per minute is 20*100=2000 polegadas per minute, which converts to 2000/60≈33.333 polegadas per second. But that seems like a high speed. Alternatively, if a \"pace\" is 10 polegadas (10 inches), then 20 paces per minute is 200 polegadas per minute, which is 200/60≈3.333 polegadas per second. But that's very slow. \n\nWait, maybe there is a standard conversion between paces and polegadas. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to convert paces to inches using a different method. Wait, let me think. Maybe the problem is from a source where 1 pace = 100 cm. Then, 1 pace = 100 cm = 39.37 inches. Then, 20 paces per minute = 20*39.37 inches per minute ≈ 787.4 inches per minute. Convert to inches per second: 787.4 / 60 ≈ 13.123 inches per second. That seems more reasonable. 13.123 inches per second is about 1.093 feet per second, which is 7.46 km/h. That's a typical walking speed, but a bicycle. Hmm, that's slow. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe I need to use the fact that 1 meter is 3.28084 feet, so 1 foot is 0.3048 meters. Therefore, 1 inch is 0.0254 meters. So, if I have 20 paces per minute, and assuming 1 pace is 1 foot (0.3048 meters), then 20 feet per minute is 20*0.3048 = 6.096 meters per minute. Convert to meters per second: 6.096 / 60 = 0.1016 meters per second. Convert to inches per second: 0.1016 meters * 39.37 inches/meter ≈ 4.0 inches per second. So, 4 inches per second. But that's very slow for a bicycle. Wait, but 4 inches per second is 24 inches per minute, which is 2 feet per minute. That's not possible. Wait, something is wrong here. \n\nWait, 20 paces per minute. If each pace is 1 foot (0.3048 meters), then 20 paces per minute is 20*0.3048 = 6.096 meters per minute. To get meters per second, divide by 60: 6.096 / 60 ≈ 0.1016 m/s. To convert to inches per second: 0.1016 m/s * 39.37 in/m ≈ 4.0 inches per second. But that's 4 inches per second, which is 24 inches per minute, which is 2 feet per minute. That seems way too slow. So, this can't be right. Therefore, my assumption about the pace length must be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 pace is equal to 40 inches. Then, 20 paces per minute would be 800 inches per minute. Convert to inches per second: 800 / 60 ≈ 13.333 inches per second. That's 13.333 inches per second, which is 1.111 feet per second, which is about 1.34 km/h. Still slow. \n\nWait, maybe the problem uses a different definition. Wait, maybe \"pace\" is a unit equivalent to 100 polegadas (inches). Let's try that. If 1 pace = 100 polegadas, then 20 paces per minute = 2000 polegadas per minute. Convert to polegadas per second: 2000 / 60 ≈ 33.333 polegadas per second. That's 33.33 inches per second. Converting to feet per second: 33.33 / 12 ≈ 2.777 feet per second. That's about 18.64 km/h. That's a reasonable cycling speed. But why would someone define a pace as 100 inches? That seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"pace\" as a different unit. Wait, maybe in the problem's context, \"pace\" is defined as 10 polegadas. Then, 20 paces per minute is 200 polegadas per minute. Convert to polegadas per second: 200 / 60 ≈ 3.333 polegadas per second. That's 3.333 inches per second. That's very slow. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to convert paces to polegadas using a direct conversion factor that is given in the problem, but it's", "answer": "4"}
{"original_question": "Um comitê do Senado tem 8 republicanos e 6 democratas. De quantas maneiras podemos formar um subcomitê de 5 membros que tenha pelo menos um membro de cada partido?", "question": "Um comitê do Senado tem 8 republicanos e 6 democratas. De quantas maneiras podemos formar um subcomitê de 5 membros que tenha pelo menos um membro de cada partido?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about forming a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee that has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. The subcommittee needs to have at least one member from each party. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many different ways we can form such a subcommittee.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, making a total of 14 members. We need to choose a subcommittee of 5 people, but it must include at least one Republican and at least one Democrat. So, it can't be all Republicans or all Democrats. Got it.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, when dealing with \"at least one\" conditions, sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possible subcommittees without any restrictions and then subtract the ones that don't meet the condition. That is, total number minus the ones that are all one party. That should give the number of valid subcommittees with at least one from each party.\n\nLet me verify that approach. The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is combination of 14 choose 5. Then, the number of all-attSSFicients is the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 plus the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6. Then subtract these from the total. That seems right.\n\nSo, mathematically, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of valid subcommittees = Total subcommittees - (All-attSSFicients + All-Democrats)\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nC(14,5) - [C(8,5) + C(6,5)]\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, C(14,5). The formula for combinations is n! / (k! * (n - k)!).\n\nCalculating C(14,5):\n\n14! / (5! * 9!) = (14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = let's compute that.\n\n14 × 13 = 182\n\n182 × 12 = 2184\n\n2184 × 11 = 24024\n\n24024 × 10 = 240240\n\nDenominator: 5 × 4 = 20; 20 × 3 = 60; 60 × 2 = 120; 120 × 1 = 120.\n\nSo, 240240 / 120 = 2002. So, C(14,5) is 2002.\n\nNext, C(8,5). Let's compute that.\n\n8! / (5! * 3!) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 336 / 6 = 56.\n\nSo, C(8,5) = 56.\n\nThen, C(6,5). Since 6 choose 5 is the same as 6 choose 1, which is 6. Alternatively, compute it:\n\n6! / (5! * 1!) = 6 / 1 = 6. So, C(6,5) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of invalid subcommittees is 56 + 6 = 62.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid subcommittees is 2002 - 62 = 1940.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, C(14,5):\n\n14 choose 5. Let me compute it again step by step.\n\n14*13*12*11*10 / 5*4*3*2*1\n\n14 divided by 2 is 7, so 14/2 = 7. Then, 10/5 = 2. So, cancelling 14 and 2 in the denominator, 14/2 = 7, and 10/5 = 2. So, numerator becomes 7*13*12*11*2. Let's compute:\n\n7*13 = 91\n\n91*12 = 1092\n\n1092*11 = 12012\n\n12012*2 = 24024\n\nDenominator: 3*1 = 3, and 4*1 = 4, so 3*4 = 12, then 12*1 = 12. Wait, no, original denominator was 5*4*3*2*1. After cancelling 14/2 and 10/5, the denominator becomes 3*2*1 = 6. Wait, but 5*4*3*2*1 = 120, and 14*13*12*11*10 = 240240. 240240 / 120 = 2002. So that's correct.\n\nC(8,5) is 56, that's correct. 8C5 = 56.\n\nC(6,5) is 6. Correct. So 56 + 6 = 62.\n\n2002 - 62 = 1940. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut let me check another way.

{"original_question": "Qual é o valor de $513^2 - 487^2$?", "question": "Qual é o valor de $513^2 - 487^2$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of 513 squared minus 487 squared. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you have a difference of squares, there's a formula to factor it. It's something like a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Let me check if that's right. Yeah, that's the difference of squares formula. So if I apply that here, maybe I can simplify the calculation instead of calculating each square separately.\n\nLet me set a = 513 and b = 487. Then according to the formula, 513² - 487² should be equal to (513 - 487)(513 + 487). Let me compute those two parts. First, 513 minus 487. Let's subtract 487 from 513. 513 minus 400 is 113, then minus 87 more would be 113 - 87. Wait, 113 - 80 is 33, then minus 7 is 26. So that part is 26. Then, 513 plus 487. Let's add them together. 500 + 400 is 900, 13 + 87 is 100. So 900 + 100 is 1000. So now we have 26 times 1000, which is 26,000. So does that mean the answer is 26,000?\n\nLet me verify to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's compute 513 squared and 487 squared separately and subtract them. Maybe that way I can check if the difference is indeed 26,000.\n\nFirst, 513 squared. Let's compute that. 500 squared is 250,000. Then, 13 squared is 169. Then, the cross term is 2*500*13 = 13,000. So adding those together: 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 263,169. So 513 squared is 263,169.\n\nNow, 487 squared. Let's do the same breakdown. 400 squared is 160,000. 87 squared is 7,569. The cross term is 2*400*87 = 2*400*80 + 2*400*7 = 160,000 + 560,000 = 720,000. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, cross term is 2ab, which is 2*400*87. Let me compute 2*400 = 800, then 800*87. Let's break down 87 into 80 + 7. So 800*80 = 64,000 and 800*7 = 5,600. So 64,000 + 5,600 = 69,600. So the cross term is 69,600. Then, adding the squares: 160,000 (from 400²) plus 69,600 plus 7,569. So 160,000 + 69,600 is 229,600. Then, plus 7,569 is 229,600 + 7,569. Let's compute that. 229,600 + 7,000 = 236,600. Then, plus 569 is 236,600 + 500 = 237,100, plus 69 = 237,169. So 487 squared is 237,169.\n\nNow subtract 237,169 from 263,169. Let's do that. 263,169 minus 237,169. Subtract the units place: 9 - 9 = 0. Minus tens: 6 - 6 = 0. Minus hundreds: 1 - 1 = 0. Minus thousands: 3 - 7. Hmm, we need to borrow. So 263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract 237,000 from 263,000, which is 26,000. Then subtract the remaining 169 from 169, which is 0. So the difference is 26,000. So yes, that matches the result from the difference of squares formula. So both methods give me the same answer, 26,000. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that 513 is 26 more than 487, so 513 = 487 + 26. Then, 513² - 487² can be written as (487 + 26)² - 487². Expanding that, it's (487² + 2*487*26 + 26²) - 487². The 487² cancels out, leaving 2*487*26 + 26². Let me compute that. First, 2*487*26. Let's compute 487*26 first. 487*20 is 9,740 and 487*6 is 2,922. Adding those together: 9,740 + 2,922. 9,740 + 2,000 = 11,740. Then, + 922 is 12,662. Then multiply by 2: 12,662*2 = 25,324. Then add 26², which is 676. So 25,324 + 676 = 26,000. Again, same answer. So multiple methods confirm that the result is 26,000. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\boxed{26000}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\), we can use the difference of squares formula, which states \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). \n\nLet \\(a = 513\\) and \\(b = 487\\).

Qual é o maior dos três números inteiros consecutivos?", "question": "O produto de três números inteiros consecutivos é 120. Esse produto dividido pela média dos três inteiros é 24. Qual é o maior dos três números inteiros consecutivos?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the product of three consecutive integers is 120. Then, when you divide that product by the average of the three integers, the result is 24. We need to find the largest of these three numbers. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. We have three consecutive integers. Let's call them n-1, n, and n+1. Because they are consecutive, each number is one more than the previous. So, the first one is n-1, the second is n, and the third is n+1.\n\nThe product of these three numbers is 120. So, (n-1)*n*(n+1) = 120. That seems straightforward. Then, the problem says that this product divided by the average of the three integers is 24. The average of three numbers is just the sum divided by three. So, the average here would be [(n-1) + n + (n+1)] / 3. Let's compute that.\n\nAdding them up: (n-1) + n + (n+1) = n -1 + n + n +1. The -1 and +1 cancel out, so that's 3n. Then, divided by 3, the average is 3n / 3 = n. So, the average of the three consecutive integers is just the middle number, which makes sense because of symmetry. So, the average is n.\n\nTherefore, the problem states that the product divided by the average is 24. So, (n-1)*n*(n+1)/n = 24. Let me write that out: (n-1)*n*(n+1)/n = 24. Simplifying this, the n in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we get (n-1)*(n+1) = 24. Which simplifies to n² -1 = 24. Therefore, n² = 25. So, n = 5 or n = -5. Hmm, so possible solutions are n=5 or n=-5.\n\nBut we need to check both possibilities because sometimes when you square numbers, you might get extraneous solutions. Let's check n=5 first. If n=5, then the three numbers are 4,5,6. Their product is 4*5*6 = 120. Perfect, that matches the first condition. Then, the average is 5, so 120 divided by 5 is 24. That works. Now, check n=-5. If n=-5, then the three numbers are -6, -5, -4. Their product is (-6)*(-5)*(-4) = -120. Wait, that's -120, but the problem says the product is 120. So, that's a problem. So, n=-5 gives a product of -120, which doesn't satisfy the first condition. Therefore, n=-5 is not a valid solution. So, the only valid solution is n=5. Therefore, the three numbers are 4,5,6, and the largest is 6. So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem says three consecutive integers. If they are consecutive, could they be increasing or decreasing? But in the case of n=-5, the numbers would be -6, -5, -4, which are consecutive but in decreasing order. However, their product is negative. But the problem states the product is 120, which is positive. So, positive product comes from either three positive numbers or one positive and two negative numbers. But three consecutive integers with a product of 120. Let's see. If we take three positive numbers, like 4,5,6, product 120. If we take three negative numbers, like -6,-5,-4, product is -120, which is not 120. So, only possible positive integers are 4,5,6. Alternatively, maybe two negative and one positive? Let's see. For example, -5, -4, -3: product is -60. Not 120. -4, -3, -2: product is -24. -3, -2, -1: product is -6. So, no. If you have two positive and one negative, but consecutive integers. For example, -6, -5, -4: product negative. Or 5,6,7: product 210. 3,4,5: 60. So, the only way to get a positive product is with three positive integers. So, 4,5,6. So, that works. Therefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let's check if there are other possible triples. Suppose n is a different number. For example, if n=6: numbers 5,6,7. Product 210. Divided by average 6: 210/6=35≠24. Similarly, n=4: numbers 3,4,5. Product 60. Divided by 4: 15≠24. So, no. Similarly, n=3: 2,3,4. Product 24. 24 divided by 3 is 8≠24. So, no. So, only n=5 works. Hence, the numbers are 4,5,6, and the largest is 6. So, the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest of the three integers is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\).

And I need to find the positive value of x. Alright, let's start breaking this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the equation is written as ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Cube roots can sometimes be tricky because they can take negative values, but since the problem specifies a positive value of x, maybe that will help later. \n\nSo, the cube root of something equals 16. To get rid of the cube root, I should probably cube both sides of the equation. Let me write that down. \n\nIf I cube both sides, that would be [∛(x² - 4x + 4)]³ = 16³. The cube and the cube root should cancel each other out on the left side, right? So that simplifies to x² - 4x + 4 = 16³. \n\nWait, 16 cubed. Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... Hmm, 256*10 is 2560, 256*6 is 1536, so 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So 16³ is 4096. \n\nSo now the equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Let me rearrange this to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 4096 from both sides: x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplify that: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. \n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. Hmm, solving quadratics usually involves factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me check if this quadratic factors nicely. \n\nLooking at the coefficients: the quadratic term is 1, so factors would be (x + a)(x + b) where a and b multiply to -4092 and add up to -4. Hmm, factoring 4092... That's a large number. Maybe it's easier to use the quadratic formula here. \n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [4 ± √(16 + 4*1*4092)] / 2. Let me compute the discriminant first: 16 + 4*1*4092. Let's calculate that. 4*4092 is 16368. Then 16 + 16368 is 16384. So the discriminant is √16384. \n\nWhat's the square root of 16384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128: 100*100 is 10,000, 28*28 is 784, and cross terms are 2*100*28 = 5600. So 10,000 + 5600 + 784 = 16,384. Yep, so √16384 = 128. \n\nSo then, x = [4 ± 128]/2. So that gives two solutions: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66, and (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62. \n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x, so x = 66. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's plug x = 66 back into the original equation to make sure. \n\nFirst, compute x² - 4x + 4. That would be 66² - 4*66 + 4. Let's calculate each term:\n\n66 squared: 66*66. Let's do 60*60 = 3600, 60*6 = 360, 6*60 = 360, 6*6 = 36. So (60+6)^2 = 60² + 2*60*6 + 6² = 3600 + 720 + 36 = 4356.\n\nThen, 4*66 = 264. So 4356 - 264 + 4. 4356 - 264: 4356 - 200 = 4156, then -64 = 4092. Then add 4: 4096. \n\nSo ∛4096. Wait, 16³ is 4096, so ∛4096 is indeed 16. So that checks out. \n\nSo the positive solution is x = 66. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if the quadratic was set up correctly. Original equation: cube root of (x² -4x +4) equals 16. Cubing both sides gives x² -4x +4 = 16³ = 4096. Then moving 4096 over gives x² -4x -4092 = 0. That seems right. \n\nFactoring that quadratic would require two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add to -4. Since 4092 is a large number, maybe the factors are not integers? Wait, but when we applied the quadratic formula, we got integer solutions, which is good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadratic could be factored, but given that the discriminant was a perfect square, 128, which is 16*8, so maybe the quadratic factors into (x - 66)(x + 62) = 0? Let's check. \n\nMultiply (x - 66)(x + 62): x² + 62x -66x -66*62. That simplifies to x² -4x -4092. Yep, exactly. So that's correct. \n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the positive value of x is 66.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe positive value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{66}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for the positive value of \\( x \\) such that \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\):\n\n1.

Wait, no, 15π/15 is π, so 8π/15 is 8/15 * π, which is 8/15 ≈ 0.533, so 0.533π. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2π/15 is 2/15 of π, 4π/15 is 4/15, 8π/15 is 8/15, which is 0.533π, but π is 15/15. Wait, 8π/15 is less than π? Wait, π is 15π/15. 8π/15 is less than π? No, 8/15 is 0.533, so 8π/15 is about 0.533π, which is less than π. Wait, no, π is 15π/15. So 8π/15 is less than π? Wait, 8π/15 is 8/15 * π, which is (8/15)*π, which is less than π because 8/15 < 1. So 8π/15 is in the first half of the unit circle. Similarly, 16π/15 is 16/15 * π, which is more than π. So cos(16π/15) is cos(π + π/15) which is -cos(π/15) because cosine is negative in the third quadrant and cos(π + x) = -cos(x). So maybe that can be simplified.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the other angles:\n\ncos(2π/15): 2π/15 is in the first quadrant.\n\ncos(4π/15): 4π/15 is also in the first quadrant.\n\ncos(8π/15): 8π/15 is in the second quadrant (since π/2 is 7.5π/15), so 8π/15 is between π/2 and π. Cosine is negative there.\n\ncos(16π/15): as mentioned, that's in the third quadrant, so cosine is negative.\n\nSo the product is [positive][positive][negative][negative] = positive * positive * negative * negative = positive * positive = positive. So the overall product is positive.\n\nBut maybe we can pair them in some way. Let's see:\n\ncos(2π/15) and cos(8π/15): 2π/15 and 8π/15. 8π/15 is π - 7π/15, so cos(8π/15) = -cos(7π/15). Similarly, cos(4π/15) and cos(16π/15): 16π/15 is π + π/15, so cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So perhaps we can rewrite the product as:\n\ncos(2π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(16π/15) = [cos(2π/15) * -cos(7π/15)] * [cos(4π/15) * -cos(π/15)] = [ -cos(2π/15)cos(7π/15) ] * [ -cos(4π/15)cos(π/15) ] = positive * positive? Wait, no, two negatives multiplied together would be positive. So maybe the overall product is positive, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to pair them. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe using multiple-angle identities or product-to-sum formulas. Let me recall that product of cosines can sometimes be expressed as a sum, but with four terms, that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here. Let's note that the angles are doubling each time: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. So each angle is double the previous one modulo 2π. So perhaps this is a geometric sequence in angles with ratio 2, but since it's modulo 2π, 16π/15 is equivalent to 16π/15 - 2π = 16π/15 - 30π/15 = -14π/15, but cosine is even, so cos(-14π/15) = cos(14π/15). Wait, but 14π/15 is π - π/15, so cos(14π/15) = -cos(π/15). So cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). So that's the same as before.\n\nSo maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see: starting with θ = 2π/15, then 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. But 16π/15 is equivalent to -14π/15, which is π + π/15, so as before. So perhaps we can consider the product as cos(θ)cos(2θ)cos(4θ)cos(8θ) where θ = 2π/15. Wait, but 8θ would be 16π/15, which is the last term. So maybe there's a formula for the product of cosines of angles that are doubling each time.\n\nI recall that there is a formula for the product of cosines when each angle is double the previous one. For example, the product formula for cos θ cos 2θ cos 4θ... up to 2^{n-1}θ. But in our case, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. But 16π/15 is greater than π, so maybe we need to adjust for that. Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity that relates the product of cosines to sine functions. There is a formula that says that the product of cosines can be expressed as a ratio involving sine functions. For example, the product formula:\n\ncos(θ)cos(2θ)cos(4θ)...cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ)\n\nBut this is when θ is not a multiple of π. Wait, let me check.\n\nYes, I think there is a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one. For example, for n terms, the product cosθ cos2θ cos4θ...cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). Let me verify this with a small n. Let's take n=2: cosθ cos2θ = [sin4θ]/(4 sinθ). Let's compute:\n\nLeft-hand side: cosθ cos2θ.\n\nRight-hand side: sin4θ/(4 sinθ).\n\nBut sin4θ = 2 sin2θ cos2θ = 2*(2 sinθ cosθ) cos2θ = 4 sinθ cosθ cos2θ. So sin4θ/(4 sinθ) = (4 sinθ cosθ cos2θ)/(4 sinθ) = cosθ cos2θ. So yes, it works for n=2.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: cosθ cos2θ cos4θ = sin8θ/(8 sinθ). Let's check:\n\nLeft-hand side: cosθ cos2θ cos4θ.\n\nMultiply by 2 sinθ: 2 sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ = sin2θ cos2θ cos4θ.\n\nThen multiply by 2 again: 2 sin2θ cos2θ cos4θ = sin4θ cos4θ.\n\nMultiply by 2 again: 2 sin4θ cos4θ = sin8θ.\n\nTherefore, 8 sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ = sin8θ => cosθ cos2θ cos4θ = sin8θ/(8 sinθ). So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, in general, for n terms, the product is sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ).\n\nSo in our case, if we have angles θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ, which is 4 terms (n=4), then the product would be sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). Let's check:\n\nθ = 2π/15, so 16θ = 32π/15. But 32π/15 is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product would be sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16. Wait, but hold on, in our original problem, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. But according to the formula, it's θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. So θ = 2π/15, then 2θ = 4π/15, 4θ = 8π/15, 8θ = 16π/15. So yes, exactly the angles given. Therefore, according to the formula, the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). But θ = 2π/15, so 16θ = 32π/15 = 2π + 2π/15. So sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, sin(32π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16. So the product is 1/16. But wait, let me double-check because this seems too straightforward.\n\nBut wait, in the formula, the product is cosθ cos2θ cos4θ cos8θ = sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). But in our case, θ = 2π/15. So sin(16θ) = sin(32π/15) = sin(2π + 2π/15) = sin(2π/15). So sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16. So the product is 1/16. But wait, but in our original problem, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. But according to the formula, that product is 1/16. However, in the formula, the product is cosθ cos2θ cos4θ cos8θ, which for θ = 2π/15, gives exactly the angles in the problem. So according to the formula, the answer is 1/16. But let me check if there's any catch here.\n\nWait, but in the formula, the angles are θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ, but when θ = 2π/15, 8θ = 16π/15, which is correct. So the formula applies here. But wait, the formula gives the product as sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). But 16θ is 32π/15, which is equivalent to 2π/15 modulo 2π. So sin(16θ) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ) = sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16. So yes, the product is 1/16. Therefore, the answer is 1/16. But let me verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, compute cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15).\n\nBut note that cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). Similarly, cos(8π/15) = cos(π - 7π/15) = -cos(7π/15). So substituting these in:\n\nProduct = cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * (-cos(7π/15)) * (-cos(π/15)) = [cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(π/15) * cos(7π", "answer": "\\frac{1}{16}"}

There's also a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.\n\nSince ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude AM must split the triangle into two congruent right triangles, right? So, M is the midpoint of BC. That means BM = MC. The length of AM is given as 11, which is the height of the triangle. Point D is on AM, 10 units from A, so DM must be 1 unit because AM is 11. So D is 10 units up from the bottom at M, or 1 unit below A.\n\nThe key part here is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ. Then angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow. Maybe using trigonometry or triangle properties?\n\nLet me start by setting up some variables. Let’s let AB = AC = x, and BC = 2y, so that BM = MC = y. Then, since AM is the altitude, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABM. So, x² = y² + 11². Therefore, x = sqrt(y² + 121). That's one relationship.\n\nNow, point D is on AM, 10 units from A, so coordinates might help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let’s place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0), so BC is from (-y,0) to (y,0). Then point D is at (0,1) since it's 10 units down from A along AM. Wait, AM is 11 units, so AD is 10 units, so D is 1 unit away from M. So coordinates: A(0,11), D(0,1), M(0,0), B(-y,0), C(y,0).\n\nNow, angle BDC is 3θ. Let me find θ first. In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Since ABC is isosceles, the base angles at B and C are equal. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so θ + 2α = 180°, where α is angle ABC. So α = (180° - θ)/2.\n\nBut how does angle BDC relate to θ? Let's consider triangle BDC. Points B, D, C. Coordinates of B(-y,0), D(0,1), C(y,0). So, we can compute vectors or use coordinates to find angle BDC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle BDC. Let me see. In triangle BDC, sides BD, DC, and BC. Let me compute the lengths.\n\nFirst, BD: distance from B(-y,0) to D(0,1). That's sqrt((0 - (-y))² + (1 - 0)²) = sqrt(y² + 1).\n\nSimilarly, DC: distance from D(0,1) to C(y,0). Same as BD, sqrt(y² + 1).\n\nBC is 2y.\n\nSo triangle BDC has sides BD = DC = sqrt(y² + 1), and BC = 2y. Therefore, triangle BDC is isosceles with BD = DC. Therefore, angles at B and C are equal. Wait, but angle BDC is the angle at D, which is 3θ. So in triangle BDC, the angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote them as φ each. Then, 3θ + 2φ = 180°, so φ = (180° - 3θ)/2.\n\nBut also, in triangle ABC, angle at A is θ, and angles at B and C are α = (180° - θ)/2. So angle at B in triangle ABC is α = (180° - θ)/2. But angle at B in triangle BDC is φ = (180° - 3θ)/2. Wait, but angle at B in triangle BDC is adjacent to angle at B in triangle ABC. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nPoint D is inside triangle ABC. So angle at B in triangle BDC is different from angle at B in triangle ABC. Hmm, maybe we need to relate these angles through some other method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find angle BDC. Let's compute vectors.\n\nVector DB goes from D(0,1) to B(-y,0): (-y, -1).\n\nVector DC goes from D(0,1) to C(y,0): (y, -1).\n\nThe angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula.\n\nThe dot product of vectors DB and DC is (-y)(y) + (-1)(-1) = -y² + 1.\n\nThe magnitudes of DB and DC are both sqrt(y² + 1).\n\nSo, cos(angle BDC) = ( -y² + 1 ) / ( sqrt(y² + 1) * sqrt(y² + 1) ) = (1 - y²) / (y² + 1).\n\nTherefore, angle BDC = arccos( (1 - y²)/(1 + y²) ).\n\nBut we also know angle BDC is 3θ. Let's express θ in terms of y.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = sqrt(y² + 121), then by the Law of Cosines:\n\nBC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cosθ\n\nBut BC is 2y, AB = AC = sqrt(y² + 121). So:\n\n(2y)² = 2*(y² + 121) - 2*(y² + 121)*cosθ\n\nSimplify:\n\n4y² = 2(y² + 121) - 2(y² + 121)cosθ\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2y² = y² + 121 - (y² + 121)cosθ\n\nSubtract y² + 121 from both sides:\n\n2y² - y² - 121 = - (y² + 121)cosθ\n\nSo:\n\ny² - 121 = - (y² + 121)cosθ\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n121 - y² = (y² + 121)cosθ\n\nTherefore:\n\ncosθ = (121 - y²)/(y² + 121)\n\nSo θ = arccos( (121 - y²)/(121 + y²) )\n\nBut angle BDC is 3θ, so:\n\narccos( (1 - y²)/(1 + y²) ) = 3 arccos( (121 - y²)/(121 + y²) )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can use trigonometric identities here. Let me denote φ = arccos( (121 - y²)/(121 + y²) ), so that 3φ = arccos( (1 - y²)/(1 + y²) )\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, let's use the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.\n\nIn triangle BDC, sides BD = DC = sqrt(y² + 1), BC = 2y.\n\nLaw of Sines: BD / sinφ = BC / sin(3θ)\n\nBut BD = sqrt(y² + 1), BC = 2y, and angle at D is 3θ. Wait, in triangle BDC, angles are 3θ at D, and two angles at B and C which are equal, each (180° - 3θ)/2.\n\nWait, maybe Law of Sines is better. Let's denote angle at B as φ and angle at C as φ. Then:\n\nBD / sinφ = BC / sin(3θ)\n\nBut BD = sqrt(y² + 1), BC = 2y, so:\n\nsqrt(y² + 1) / sinφ = 2y / sin(3θ)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABC, angle at A is θ, angles at B and C are α = (180° - θ)/2.\n\nBut angle at B in triangle BDC is φ, which is different from α. However, maybe these angles are related. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is isosceles, and D is on the altitude, perhaps there's some symmetry. Let me try to relate θ and φ.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates again. The coordinates are A(0,11), B(-y,0), C(y,0), D(0,1). So, angle BDC is the angle at D between points B and C. So, the angle between vectors DB and DC.\n\nEarlier, we found that cos(angle BDC) = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²). And angle BDC is 3θ, so:\n\ncos(3θ) = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)\n\nBut we also have cosθ = (121 - y²)/(121 + y²) from earlier.\n\nSo, we can use the triple angle formula for cosine. Recall that cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n4cos³θ - 3cosθ = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)\n\nBut we know cosθ = (121 - y²)/(121 + y²). Let's substitute that in:\n\n4[(121 - y²)/(121 + y²)]³ - 3[(121 - y²)/(121 + y²)] = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)\n\nThis looks very complicated, but maybe we can simplify it. Let me denote z = y² for simplicity.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n4[(121 - z)/(121 + z)]³ - 3[(121 - z)/(121 + z)] = (1 - z)/(1 + z)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, let’s compute [(121 - z)/(121 + z)]³. Let's call this term A.\n\nA = [(121 - z)/(121 + z)]³\n\nThen, 4A - 3[(121 - z)/(121 + z)] = (1 - z)/(1 + z)\n\nLet’s factor out [(121 - z)/(121 + z)] from the left side:\n\n[(121 - z)/(121 + z)] * [4A/( (121 - z)/(121 + z) )² - 3] = (1 - z)/(1 + z)\n\nWait, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, cross-multiplied.\n\nMultiply both sides by (121 + z)³(1 + z) to eliminate denominators. But this might get too messy. Alternatively, let me let t = (121 - z)/(121 + z). Then, we can express z in terms of t:\n\nt = (121 - z)/(121 + z)\n\nMultiply both sides by (121 + z):\n\nt(121 + z) = 121 - z\n\n121t + tz = 121 - z\n\nBring terms with z to one side:\n\ntz + z = 121 - 121t\n\nz(t + 1) = 121(1 - t)\n\nTherefore, z = [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - z)/(1 + z) can be expressed in terms of t:\n\n(1 - z)/(1 + z) = [1 - (121(1 - t)/(t + 1))]/[1 + (121(1 - t)/(t + 1))]\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n\n1 - [121(1 - t)/(t + 1)] = [ (t + 1) - 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ t + 1 - 121 + 121t ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ (t + 121t) + (1 - 121) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ 122t - 120 ] / (t + 1 )\n\nDenominator:\n\n1 + [121(1 - t)/(t + 1)] = [ (t + 1) + 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ t + 1 + 121 - 121t ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ (t - 121t) + (1 + 121) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ -120t + 122 ] / (t + 1 )\n\nTherefore, (1 - z)/(1 + z) = [1 - z]/[1 + z] = [122t - 120]/[-120t + 122] = [122(t - 1)] / [ -120(t - 1) ] = 122 / (-120) = -122/120 = -61/60, wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait, numerator: 122t - 120\n\nDenominator: -120t + 122\n\nSo, factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2*(61t - 60)\n\nDenominator: -2*(60t - 61)\n\nSo, (122t - 120)/(-120t + 122) = [2*(61t - 60)] / [-2*(60t - 61)] = - (61t - 60)/(60t - 61) = (60 - 61t)/(61 - 60t)\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe instead of substituting, let's go back to the original equation:\n\n4[(121 - z)/(121 + z)]³ - 3[(121 - z)/(121 + z)] = (1 - z)/(1 + z)\n\nLet me denote t = (121 - z)/(12", "answer": "11 \\sqrt{5} + 11"}
{"original_question": "A soma de 27 inteiros positivos consecutivos é $3^7$. Qual é a sua mediana?", "question": "A soma de 27 inteiros positivos consecutivos é $3^7$. Qual é a sua mediana?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is equal to 3 to the power of 7. We need to find their median. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have consecutive numbers, especially an odd number of them, the median is going to be the middle number. Since there are 27 numbers, the median will be the 14th term. That makes sense because in a list of numbers, the middle one when they're ordered is the median. So, if they're consecutive, the 14th term is the median.\n\nNow, the sum of these 27 consecutive integers is 3^7. Let me compute 3^7 to get a sense of what we're dealing with. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, and 3^7 is 2187. So the sum is 2187.\n\nOkay, so we have 27 consecutive numbers adding up to 2187. Let me recall the formula for the sum of consecutive numbers. If we have an arithmetic sequence, the sum is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last term. But since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1.\n\nAlternatively, for consecutive integers, the average is the same as the median because they are evenly spaced. Wait, yes! Since they are consecutive, the average will be the median. Because in an arithmetic sequence, the average is the average of the first and last term, but when the number of terms is odd, the median is exactly the middle term, which is equal to the average. So actually, the median is equal to the average here.\n\nTherefore, the median is equal to the sum divided by the number of terms. Because sum = average * number of terms, so average = sum / number of terms. Since the average is the median in this case, the median is 2187 divided by 27.\n\nLet me compute that. 2187 divided by 27. Let's see, 27 times 80 is 2160. Then 2187 minus 2160 is 27. So 27 times 81 is 2187. Therefore, 2187 divided by 27 is 81. So the median is 81.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's make sure that this makes sense. If the median is 81, then the sequence is from (81 - 13) to (81 + 13), since there are 27 numbers. So starting at 68 up to 94? Let's check the sum. The sum of consecutive numbers can also be calculated as the number of terms times the median. So 27 * 81 = 2187, which matches the given sum. Therefore, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way to confirm. Let's denote the first term as n. Then the 27 consecutive integers are n, n+1, n+2, ..., n+26. The sum of these is 27n + (0+1+2+...+26). The sum of the first k integers starting from 0 is k(k-1)/2. Wait, actually, the sum from 0 to 26 is (26)(27)/2 = 351. Therefore, the total sum is 27n + 351. According to the problem, this sum is 2187. Therefore, 27n + 351 = 2187.\n\nSolving for n: 27n = 2187 - 351 = 1836. Then n = 1836 / 27. Let's compute that. 27*60 = 1620. 1836 - 1620 = 216. 27*8 = 216. So 60 + 8 = 68. Therefore, n = 68. So the first term is 68, and the last term is 68 + 26 = 94. Therefore, the sequence is from 68 to 94. The median is the 14th term. Let's count: 68 is the first, 69 the second, ..., 68 + 13 = 81 is the 14th term. So the median is 81. That matches the previous result. Therefore, the answer is 81.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same conclusion. First, by recognizing that the median equals the average, which is the sum divided by the number of terms. Second, by setting up the equation for the sum and solving for the first term, then finding the median as the 14th term. Both approaches confirm that the median is 81.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. The key was to realize that for consecutive integers, the median is equal to the average, which is the sum divided by the number of terms. Then, either using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence or setting up the equation with the first term and solving for it. Both ways, the answer comes out to 81. So I feel confident that 81 is the correct median.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe median is \\boxed{81}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is \\(3^7\\), we need to find their median.\n\nFirst, we note that \\(3^7 = 2187\\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle term. For 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th term.\n\nThe sum of consecutive integers can also be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The sum \\(S\\) of \\(n\\) terms with the first term \\(a\\) and the last term \\(l\\) is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nHowever, since the integers are consecutive, the average is equal to the median. Therefore, the median (and average) can be found by dividing the total sum by the number of terms:\n\\[\n\\text{Median} = \\frac{2187}{27} = 81\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we denote the first term as \\(n\\). The sum of 27 consecutive integers starting from \\(n\\) is:\n\\[\n27n + \\sum_{k=0}^{26} k = 2187\n\\]\nThe sum of the first 26 integers is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{26} k = \\frac{26 \\times 27}{2} = 351\n\\]\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n27n + 351 = 2187\n\\]\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n27n = 2187 - 351 = 1836 \\implies n = \\frac{1836}{27} = 68\n\\]\nThe sequence starts at 68 and ends at \\(68 + 26 = 94\\). The 14th term (median) is:\n\\[\n68 + 13 = 81\n\\]\n\nThus, the median is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).", "answer": "81"}

Expresse sua resposta em notação de intervalo.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the inequality -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21 for real values of x. Hmm, this is a compound inequality, so I have to break it down into two separate inequalities and find the intersection of their solutions. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the left part: -4 < x⁴ + 4x². Then, the right part: x⁴ + 4x² < 21. If I can solve both, then the values of x that satisfy both will be the solution to the original inequality.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: -4 < x⁴ + 4x². Let me rearrange this to x⁴ + 4x² + 4 > 0. Wait, that looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Let me set y = x². Then, the inequality becomes y² + 4y + 4 > 0. \n\nHmm, y² + 4y + 4 factors into (y + 2)². So, (y + 2)² > 0. Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality is true for all real y except when (y + 2)² = 0. That happens when y = -2. But y is x², which is always non-negative. So y = -2 is impossible. Therefore, (y + 2)² is always positive. So, the left inequality x⁴ + 4x² + 4 > 0 is always true for all real x. So, the left part doesn't restrict x at all. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the right inequality: x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Again, let's substitute y = x². Then, the inequality becomes y² + 4y < 21. Bringing 21 to the left: y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Let's solve the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0 to find critical points.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)]/2 = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2. So, the solutions are y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3 and y = (-4 -10)/2 = -14/2 = -7. \n\nSo, the quadratic y² + 4y - 21 factors as (y - 3)(y + 7). Since the coefficient of y² is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 is satisfied between the roots y = -7 and y = 3. So, -7 < y < 3. But y = x², which is always ≥ 0. Therefore, combining these, we have 0 ≤ y < 3. \n\nSo, x² < 3. Taking square roots, that means -√3 < x < √3. \n\nBut wait, let me check. Since y = x² must be ≥ 0, the interval for y is [0, 3), which translates to x² < 3. So, x is in (-√3, √3). \n\nTherefore, the solution to the original compound inequality is the intersection of the solutions of both parts. But the left part didn't restrict x, so the solution is just x ∈ (-√3, √3). \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify this with some test values. Let's take x = 0. Then, x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. Which is between -4 and 21. So, that's okay. \n\nTake x = 1. Then, x⁴ + 4x² = 1 + 4 = 5, which is less than 21. \n\nTake x = √3. Then, x⁴ + 4x² = (√3)^4 + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 4*3 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the original inequality is x⁴ + 4x² < 21, so x = √3 is excluded. Similarly for x = -√3. \n\nWhat about x = 2? Then, x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32, which is greater than 21, so 2 is excluded. \n\nSo, seems like the solution is indeed (-√3, √3). \n\nWait, but let me check the left inequality again. The left inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x². But since x⁴ + 4x² is always non-negative (as x⁴ and 4x² are both non-negative), the smallest value it can take is 0 (when x = 0). Therefore, -4 < 0 is always true. So, indeed, the left inequality doesn't impose any restrictions, so the entire solution is determined by the right inequality. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be x ∈ (-√3, √3). \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, when solving the right inequality, we substituted y = x², solved for y, found that y must be less than 3, so x² < 3. But x² < 3 does mean that x is between -√3 and √3. So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the original inequality for some x in that interval and outside. For x = 0, as before, it's 0 which is between -4 and 21. For x = √3, it's 21 which is equal to 21, so not included. For x = 2, as before, it's 32 which is more than 21, so excluded. \n\nTherefore, the solution is x in (-√3, √3). \n\nBut let me make sure that there isn't a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let's re-examine the quadratic inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0. The quadratic opens upwards, so it's negative between the roots. The roots are at y = -7 and y = 3. But since y = x² ≥ 0, the valid interval for y is [0, 3). Therefore, x² must be less than 3, so x is between -√3 and √3. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (-√3, √3). \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the inequality are all real numbers between \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\). In interval notation, this is \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\) for real values of \\(x\\), we break it down into two separate inequalities and find the intersection of their solutions.\n\n1. **Left part inequality: \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\)**\n\n   Since \\(x^4\\) and \\(4x^2\\) are non-negative for all real \\(x\\), \\(x^4 + 4x^2\\) is always non-negative. Therefore, the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\) is always true for all real \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Right part inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)**\n\n   Substitute \\(y = x^2\\). The inequality becomes \\(y^2 + 4y < 21\\). Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\n   \\]\n   Solving the quadratic equation \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 10}{2}\n   \\]\n   The roots are \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\). Since \\(y = x^2 \\geq 0\\), we consider the interval between the roots where the quadratic is negative. The valid interval for \\(y\\) is \\(0 \\leq y < 3\\). Converting back to \\(x\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 < 3 \\implies -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\nThe intersection of the solutions of both inequalities is \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThus, the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the inequality are \\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}\\).", "answer": "(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})"}

Hmm. \n\nFirst, I remember that there are some identities related to symmetric sums.

Let me see:\n\nxy² + x²y = xy(y + x)\n\nSimilarly, xz² + x²z = xz(z + x)\n\nAnd yz² + y²z = yz(z + y)\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\nxy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) / something?

Let's note that.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find another equation involving (x + y + z) and (xy + yz + zx). Let's recall that x³ + y³ + z³ = 4.\n\nAlso, another identity: x³ + y³ + z³ = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz\n\nWe have x³ + y³ + z³ = 4, and xyz = 4. Let's plug in:\n\n4 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3*4\n\nSimplify: 4 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 12\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides: -8 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx)\n\nBut earlier, we found that (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = 24. Let's denote S = x + y + z and P = xy + yz + zx. Then:\n\nFrom above, we have:\n\n-8 = S^3 - 3SP\n\nBut we also have S*P = 24. So, SP = 24. Let's substitute SP = 24 into the first equation:\n\n-8 = S^3 - 3*24\n\nWhich is -8 = S^3 - 72\n\nAdd 72 to both sides: 64 = S^3\n\nTherefore, S^3 = 64 => S = 4 (since 4^3 = 64). Then, since S*P = 24, we have 4*P = 24 => P = 6.\n\nSo, the value of xy + yz + zx is 6. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\nWe had two equations:\n\n1. S*P = 24\n\n2. S^3 - 3S*P = -8\n\nSubstituting S*P = 24 into the second equation:\n\nS^3 - 3*24 = -8 => S^3 = -8 + 72 = 64 => S = 4\n\nThen, P = 24 / S = 24 / 4 = 6.

So, we have data from a survey conducted on students at Central High School. The survey included 300 men and 300 women in each series. We need to determine for which series the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what 135% means in terms of a ratio. If something is 135% of another, that means it's 1.35 times the original amount. So, if we let F be the number of female bus riders, then the number of male bus riders should be approximately 1.35F. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the percentages given in the table. Each percentage is the proportion of passengers from each gender in the respective series. So, for example, in the 9th series, 41.1% of the male students and 39.4% of the female students take the bus. \n\nSince each series has 300 men and 300 women, we can calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders for each series. Then, we can check the ratio of male to female riders against 135% (which is 1.35) and see which series has the ratio closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each series (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th), calculate the number of male bus riders and female bus riders.\n2. Compute the ratio of male riders to female riders for each series.\n3. Compare each ratio to 1.35 and find the series with the ratio closest to 1.35.\n\nLet's start with the first series, the 9th.\n\n**9th Series:**\n- Male percentage: 41.1%\n- Female percentage: 39.4%\n\nNumber of males: 300\nNumber of females: 300\n\nCompute the number of male riders:\n41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = Let's calculate that. 0.4 * 300 = 120, 0.01 * 300 = 3, 0.001 * 300 = 0.3. So total is 120 + 3 + 0.3 = 123.3. Hmm, but since the number of people should be an integer, maybe we can keep it as 123.3 for ratio purposes.\n\nSimilarly, female riders:\n39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300. Let's compute that. 0.3 * 300 = 90, 0.09 * 300 = 27, 0.004 * 300 = 1.2. So total is 90 + 27 + 1.2 = 118.2. Again, as a decimal.\n\nNow, the ratio of male to female riders is 123.3 / 118.2. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, divide 123.3 by 118.2. Let me approximate this division.\n\n118.2 * 1 = 118.2\n123.3 - 118.2 = 5.1\nSo, 1 + (5.1 / 118.2) ≈ 1 + 0.043 ≈ 1.043. So approximately 1.043. That's about 4.3% higher than 1. So the ratio here is about 1.043, which is much less than 1.35. So the 9th series is not the answer.\n\n**10th Series:**\n- Male percentage: 34.4%\n- Female percentage: 33.1%\n\nNumber of males: 300\nNumber of females: 300\n\nMale riders: 34.4% of 300 = 0.344 * 300. Let's compute:\n\n0.3 * 300 = 90\n0.04 * 300 = 12\n0.004 * 300 = 1.2\nTotal: 90 + 12 + 1.2 = 103.2\n\nFemale riders: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331 * 300.\n\n0.3 * 300 = 90\n0.03 * 300 = 9\n0.001 * 300 = 0.3\nTotal: 90 + 9 + 0.3 = 99.3\n\nRatio: 103.2 / 99.3. Let's compute that.\n\n103.2 ÷ 99.3. Let's see:\n\n99.3 * 1 = 99.3\n103.2 - 99.3 = 3.9\nSo, 1 + (3.9 / 99.3) ≈ 1 + 0.0392 ≈ 1.0392. So approximately 1.0392. Again, around 3.9% higher than 1. Still way below 1.35. So 10th series is not the answer either.\n\n**11th Series:**\n- Male percentage: 20.6%\n- Female percentage: 13.8%\n\nCalculating the numbers:\n\nMale riders: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300.\n\n0.2 * 300 = 60\n0.006 * 300 = 1.8\nTotal: 60 + 1.8 = 61.8\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300.\n\n0.1 * 300 = 30\n0.03 * 300 = 9\n0.008 * 300 = 2.4\nTotal: 30 + 9 + 2.4 = 41.4\n\nRatio: 61.8 / 41.4. Let's calculate this.\n\n61.8 ÷ 41.4. Let's see:\n\n41.4 * 1.5 = 62.1 (since 41.4 * 1 = 41.4, 41.4 * 0.5 = 20.7; total 41.4 + 20.7 = 62.1)\n\nBut the numerator is 61.8, which is 0.3 less than 62.1. So, 1.5 - (0.3 / 41.4) ≈ 1.5 - 0.0072 ≈ 1.4928. So approximately 1.493. That's very close to 1.5. But we need 1.35. Hmm, so 1.493 is higher than 1.35. Let's note that the 11th series ratio is approximately 1.493.\n\n**12th Series:**\n- Male percentage: 11.6%\n- Female percentage: 8.6%\n\nCalculating the numbers:\n\nMale riders: 11.6% of 300 = 0.116 * 300.\n\n0.1 * 300 = 30\n0.01 * 300 = 3\n0.006 * 300 = 1.8\nTotal: 30 + 3 + 1.8 = 34.8\n\nFemale riders: 8.6% of 300 = 0.086 * 300.\n\n0.08 * 300 = 24\n0.006 * 300 = 1.8\nTotal: 24 + 1.8 = 25.8\n\nRatio: 34.8 / 25.8. Let's compute this.\n\n34.8 ÷ 25.8. Let's see:\n\n25.8 * 1.3 = 33.54 (25.8 * 1 = 25.8, 25.8 * 0.3 = 7.74; total 25.8 + 7.74 = 33.54)\n\n34.8 - 33.54 = 1.26\n\nSo, 1.3 + (1.26 / 25.8) ≈ 1.3 + 0.0488 ≈ 1.3488. So approximately 1.3488. That's very close to 1.35. \n\nSo, the 12th series has a ratio of approximately 1.3488, which is just slightly below 1.35. The 11th series was approximately 1.493, which is higher. The 9th and 10th were much lower. \n\nWait, but the question asks for which series the number of male riders is closest to 135% of female riders. So, we need the ratio male/female closest to 1.35. \n\nFor the 12th series, the ratio is approximately 1.3488, which is 1.35 - 0.0012. \n\nFor the 11th series, it's approximately 1.4928, which is 1.4928 - 1.35 = 0.1428 higher. \n\nComparing the differences:\n\n12th series difference: |1.3488 - 1.35| = 0.0012\n\n11th series difference: |1.4928 - 1.35| = 0.1428\n\nSo, the 12th series is much closer. \n\nWait, but let me check the 9th and 10th again. Wait, 9th series was 1.043, which is 0.307 less than 1.35. 10th was 1.0392, which is 0.3108 less. So the 9th and 10th are further below, while 11th is above by 0.1428, and 12th is 0.0012 above. So the 12th series is the closest. \n\nBut wait, let me verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with the 12th series:\n\nMale riders: 11.6% of 300. 0.116 * 300. Let me compute 0.1 * 300 = 30, 0.01 * 300 = 3, 0.006 * 300 = 1.8. So 30 + 3 + 1.8 = 34.8. Correct.\n\nFemale riders: 8.6% of 300. 0.086 * 300. 0.08 * 300 = 24, 0.006 * 300 = 1.8. 24 + 1.8 = 25.8. Correct.\n\nRatio: 34.8 / 25.8. Let me do this division again to check.\n\n25.8 goes into 34.8 how many times?\n\n25.8 * 1 = 25.8\n\n34.8 - 25.8 = 9.0\n\nBring down a zero (treating it as 90.0). Now, 25.8 goes into 90.0 three times (25.8 * 3 = 77.4)\n\n90.0 - 77.4 = 12.6\n\nBring down another zero: 126.0\n\n25.8 goes into 126.0 four times (25.8 * 4 = 103.2)\n\n126.0 - 103.2 = 22.8\n\nBring down another zero: 228.0\n\n25.8 goes into 228.0 eight times (25.8 * 8 = 206.4)\n\n228.0 - 206.4 = 21.6\n\nBring down another zero: 216.0\n\n25.8 goes into 216.0 eight times (25.8 * 8 = 206.4)\n\n216.0 - 206.4 = 9.6\n\nHmm, so the division gives us 1.3488... approximately. So 1.3488. So that's 1.3488, which is indeed approximately 1.35. The difference is 1.35 - 1.3488 = 0.0012. So very small.\n\nFor the 11th series:\n\nMale riders: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300 = 61.8\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300 = 41.4\n\nRatio: 61.8 / 41.4. Let me compute that again.\n\nDivide 61.8 by 41.4.\n\n41.4 * 1.5 = 62.1. As before, 61.8 is 0.3 less, so 1.5 - (0.3 / 41.4). 0.3 / 41.4 ≈ 0.0072. So 1.4928. Correct.\n\nSo 1.4928 - 1.35 = 0.1428. So the difference is 0.1428.\n\nComparing 0.0012 vs 0.1428, the 12th series is much closer", "answer": "12"}
{"original_question": "Resolva\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "question": "Resolva\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the inequality |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, the sign of the expression depends on the signs of the numerator and the denominator. Also, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. \n\nSo, the inequality is a fraction less than zero, which means the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. That is, either the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. But since the numerator is an absolute value, it's always non-negative, right? Because absolute value is always non-negative. So |x² - 81| ≥ 0 for all real x. Therefore, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative. Because if numerator is non-negative and denominator is negative, the fraction will be negative. If numerator is positive and denominator is positive, the fraction is positive. If numerator is zero, the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality because we need it to be less than zero. \n\nSo, breaking that down, since |x² - 81| is non-negative, the denominator must be negative. So the key here is to set the denominator x² - 36x < 0 and find the values of x where that's true. But also, we need to make sure that the denominator isn't zero because the expression would be undefined. So first, let's solve the inequality x² - 36x < 0.\n\nFactoring the denominator: x(x - 36) < 0. So the critical points are x = 0 and x = 36. To find where the expression is negative, we can test intervals between these critical points. \n\nThe critical points divide the real line into three intervals:\n1. x < 0\n2. 0 < x < 36\n3. x > 36\n\nLet's test each interval:\n1. For x < 0, say x = -1: (-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0. So positive.\n2. For 0 < x < 36, say x = 1: (1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35 < 0. So negative.\n3. For x > 36, say x = 37: (37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37 > 0. So positive.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is negative only when 0 < x < 36. But we also have to exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are x = 0 and x = 36. However, in the interval 0 < x < 36, neither 0 nor 36 are included, so we don't need to exclude anything else here.\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider the numerator. The numerator is |x² - 81|. Since absolute value is always non-negative, the numerator is either positive or zero. So the numerator is positive except when x² - 81 = 0. Let's solve x² - 81 = 0. That gives x² = 81, so x = ±9. So at x = 9 and x = -9, the numerator becomes zero. At those points, the entire expression |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) would be zero divided by something (but we have to check if the denominator is non-zero there). \n\nSo, at x = 9: denominator is 9² - 36*9 = 81 - 324 = -243 ≠ 0. So the expression is 0 / (-243) = 0. Similarly, at x = -9: denominator is (-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405 ≠ 0. So the expression is 0 / 405 = 0. Therefore, at x = 9 and x = -9, the expression equals zero, which does not satisfy the inequality < 0. Therefore, those points are excluded from the solution set.\n\nSo putting this all together: the inequality |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0 is equivalent to the denominator being negative (since numerator is non-negative and zero only at x = ±9, which make the entire expression zero). Therefore, the solution is the set of x where x² - 36x < 0, excluding x = 0 and x = 36 (but since 0 < x < 36 already excludes those), and also excluding x = 9 and x = -9 because at those points the expression is zero. Wait, but x = -9 is in the interval 0 < x < 36? No, x = -9 is less than 0, so it's in the interval x < 0. So in the interval x < 0, the denominator is positive, so even though the numerator is zero at x = -9, the entire expression is zero there. But x = -9 is in the interval x < 0 where the denominator is positive, so in that interval, the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, x = -9 must be excluded. Similarly, x = 9 is in the interval 0 < x < 36 where the denominator is negative, so even though the numerator is zero there, the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So we have to exclude both x = -9 and x = 9.\n\nBut wait, when we solved the denominator inequality x² - 36x < 0, we found that 0 < x < 36. So x = -9 is not in that interval. Therefore, in the interval 0 < x < 36, the numerator is positive (since |x² - 81| is positive unless x² - 81 = 0, which is at x = ±9). So in 0 < x < 36, x² - 81 can be positive or negative depending on x. For example, if x is between 9 and 36, x² - 81 is positive, so |x² - 81| = x² - 81. If x is between 0 and 9, x² - 81 is negative, so |x² - 81| = -(x² - 81) = 81 - x². But regardless, since the numerator is non-negative, the entire expression is non-negative divided by negative (since denominator is negative in 0 < x < 36). Therefore, in 0 < x < 36, the expression is negative or zero. But when x = 9 or x = -9, the expression is zero. So in 0 < x < 36, the expression is negative except at x = 9 where it's zero. Similarly, in x < 0, the denominator is positive, and the numerator is |x² - 81|. Let's check if the numerator is positive or negative here. For x < 0, x² is positive, and 81 is positive. So x² - 81 could be negative or positive. For example, if x = -10, x² = 100, so x² - 81 = 19, so |x² - 81| = 19. If x = -5, x² = 25, so x² - 81 = -56, so |x² - 81| = 56. So in x < 0, the numerator is always positive. Therefore, in x < 0, the expression is positive divided by positive (since denominator is positive in x < 0), so the expression is positive. Therefore, in x < 0, the expression is positive, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality <0. In the interval 0 < x < 36, the expression is negative except at x = 9 where it's zero. Therefore, the solution is 0 < x < 36 excluding x = 9. Wait, but x = 9 is in 0 < x < 36, and at x = 9, the expression is zero, so we need to exclude it. So the solution is 0 < x < 36 with x ≠ 9.\n\nBut let me check x = 9 again. At x = 9, numerator is |81 - 81| = 0, denominator is 9*9 - 36*9 = 81 - 324 = -243. So 0 divided by -243 is 0. So the expression equals zero there, which does not satisfy the inequality <0, so x = 9 is excluded. Similarly, x = -9: numerator is |81 - 81| = 0, denominator is (-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405. So 0 divided by 405 is 0. So x = -9 also gives zero, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the solution is all x in (0, 36) except x = 9. So writing that as intervals: (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36).\n\nBut let me verify with some test points. Take x = 5 (in (0,9)): denominator is 25 - 180 = -155, numerator is |25 - 81| = 56. So 56 / (-155) = negative. So satisfies inequality.\n\nTake x = 10 (in (9,36)): denominator is 100 - 360 = -260, numerator is |100 - 81| = 19. So 19 / (-260) = negative. So satisfies inequality.\n\nTake x = -5 (x < 0): denominator is 25 - (-180) = 205, numerator is |25 - 81| = 56. 56 / 205 is positive. So doesn't satisfy inequality.\n\nTake x = 45 (x >36): denominator is 2025 - 1620 = 405, numerator |2025 -81| = 1944. 1944 / 405 is positive. Doesn't satisfy.\n\nTake x = 9: denominator is -243, numerator 0. 0/-243 = 0. Doesn't satisfy.\n\nTake x = 0: denominator is 0, undefined. So excluded.\n\nTake x = 36: denominator is 36² - 36*36 = 0. Undefined. Excluded.\n\nSo all test points check out. Therefore, the solution is x in (0,9) ∪ (9,36). So written in boxed notation as \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\), we need to determine where the expression is negative.

The problem is about a rectangular field that's bordered by an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the maximum possible area of the field.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The field is a rectangle. The track goes around it, but instead of going all the way around the rectangle, it only uses two of the straight sides and replaces the other two sides with semicircles. So, the track would look like a rectangle with semicircular ends, forming a shape somewhat like a rounded rectangle.\n\nThe total length of the track is 400 meters. That length should be the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since each semicircle has a circumference of π times the radius, two semicircles would make a full circle, so their combined circumference is 2πr, where r is the radius of each semicircle. But wait, actually, the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, but each semicircle would have a length of πr. So two semicircles would add up to πr * 2 = 2πr. So the total track length is the sum of the two straight sides (each of length L, the length of the field) and the circumference of the two semicircles (which is 2πr). So the total length is 2L + 2πr = 400 meters.\n\nBut we need to express the area of the field in terms of variables and then maximize it. The area of the rectangle is L times W, where L is the length and W is the width. However, in this case, the width of the field would be equal to the diameter of the semicircles. Since each semicircle has radius r, the diameter is 2r. Therefore, the width of the field is 2r. So the area A of the field is L * W = L * 2r.\n\nBut we have the constraint from the track length: 2L + 2πr = 400. Let's write that as 2L + 2πr = 400. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2: L + πr = 200. So L = 200 - πr.\n\nTherefore, the area A = L * 2r = (200 - πr) * 2r = 400r - 2πr².\n\nNow, we need to maximize this quadratic function in terms of r. The area A(r) = -2πr² + 400r. This is a quadratic function in the form of A(r) = ar² + br + c, where a = -2π, b = 400, and c = 0. Since the coefficient of r² is negative, the parabola opens downward, so the maximum occurs at the vertex.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by A(r) = ar² + br + c is at r = -b/(2a). Plugging in the values here, we get r = -400/(2*(-2π)) = -400/(-4π) = 100/π. So the radius r is 100 divided by π meters.\n\nOnce we have r, we can find L from the equation L = 200 - πr. Substituting r = 100/π, we get L = 200 - π*(100/π) = 200 - 100 = 100 meters.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the field that maximize the area are L = 100 meters and W = 2r = 2*(100/π) = 200/π meters.\n\nThen, the maximum area A is L * W = 100 * (200/π) = 20,000/π square meters.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's compute 200/π. If π is approximately 3.1416, then 200/3.1416 is approximately 63.66 meters. So the width is about 63.66 meters, and the length is 100 meters. The area would be approximately 100 * 63.66 = 6,366 square meters. But 20,000 divided by π is approximately 6,366.1977 meters². That seems reasonable.\n\nBut let me check again the steps to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, the track is two straight sides and two semicircles. So the total length of the track is indeed 2L + 2*(πr) = 400. Wait, hold on. Wait, each semicircle has a circumference of πr, so two semicircles would be 2*(πr) = 2πr. So the equation 2L + 2πr = 400 is correct. Then simplifying, L + πr = 200. So L = 200 - πr. Then area is L*2r = (200 - πr)*2r = 400r - 2πr². Then taking derivative with respect to r: dA/dr = 400 - 4πr. Setting derivative to zero: 400 - 4πr = 0 => 4πr = 400 => r = 100/π. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using vertex formula: r = -b/(2a) for quadratic equation ax² + bx + c. Here, the quadratic is -2πr² + 400r, so a = -2π, b = 400. So r = -400/(2*(-2π)) = 400/(4π) = 100/π. So same result.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is achieved when r = 100/π, so L = 200 - π*(100/π) = 100. Then area is 100*(2*(100/π)) = 20,000/π. Which is approximately 6,366.1977 square meters.\n\nBut the problem asks for the answer in meters squared, so we need to present it as 20,000/π. But maybe we can leave it in terms of π for an exact answer. So the maximum area is 20,000 divided by π square meters. So the answer is 20,000/π m². Which is approximately 6,366.20 m². But since the problem says \"greatest possible area\", we need to present the exact value, which is 20,000/π.\n\nWait, let me check once more if there's any error in the setup.\n\nThe track consists of two straight sides (each of length L) and two semicircular ends. Each semicircle has radius r, so the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, so each semicircle is πr. Therefore, two semicircles make πr + πr = 2πr. So total track length is 2L + 2πr = 400. Then yes, the equation is correct. Then solving for L gives L = (400 - 2πr)/2 = 200 - πr. Then area is L * 2r = (200 - πr)*2r = 400r - 2πr². Taking derivative and setting to zero gives r = 100/π.

So, we have triangle RST, and they told us that sin R is 2/5. We need to find sin T. The Asymptote code shows that there's a right angle at S, right? Because of the right angle mark at S. Let me make sure I understand the triangle setup.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, points T, S, and R are defined. T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, plotting these points, T is the origin, S is two units along the x-axis, and R is straight up from S by sqrt(21) units. Then they connected the lines to form the triangle. The right angle is at S, because the right angle mark is next to S. So, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S. Wait, but the problem says \"em triangle{RST}\" – maybe that's just the label? Hmm, maybe I should confirm.\n\nYes, the Asymptote code draws a right angle at S, so triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S. That means angle S is 90 degrees. Then angles R and T are the other two angles. Since it's a right-angled triangle, the sum of angles R and T should be 90 degrees. So, angle R + angle T = 90°, which means angle T = 90° - angle R. Therefore, sin T = sin(90° - R) = cos R, because sine of an angle is cosine of its complement. So, sin T = cos R. Therefore, if we can find cos R, that will be sin T.\n\nGiven that sin R = 2/5, we can use the Pythagorean identity to find cos R. The identity is sin² R + cos² R = 1. So, cos² R = 1 - sin² R = 1 - (4/25) = 21/25. Therefore, cos R = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Since angle R is acute (as it's a triangle angle less than 90 degrees), cos R is positive. Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. So, the answer should be sqrt(21)/5.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Let's confirm step by step.\n\nFirst, triangle RST is right-angled at S. Therefore, sides:\n\n- ST is opposite angle R.\n\n- SR is opposite angle T.\n\n- RT is the hypotenuse.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure which sides correspond to which angles. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, so in this case, the hypotenuse is RT. Then, angle R is at vertex R, so the sides adjacent to angle R are RT and SR? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIn triangle RST, right-angled at S. So, vertices:\n\n- S is at (2,0), T is at (0,0), R is at (2, sqrt(21)).\n\nSo, sides:\n\n- ST: from S(2,0) to T(0,0). That's along the x-axis, length 2 units.\n\n- SR: from S(2,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)). That's vertical, length sqrt(21) units.\n\n- RT: from R(2, sqrt(21)) to T(0,0). Let's compute the length of RT. Using distance formula: sqrt[(2-0)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 21] = sqrt[25] = 5 units. So, RT is 5 units. Therefore, the hypotenuse is RT, length 5. Then, the legs are ST (length 2) and SR (length sqrt(21)).\n\nTherefore, angle R is at vertex R. So, in triangle RST, angle R is at point R, between sides RT and RS. So, sides:\n\n- Opposite angle R: ST (length 2)\n\n- Adjacent to angle R: RS (length sqrt(21))\n\n- Hypotenuse: RT (length 5)\n\nTherefore, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/RT = 2/5, which matches the given information. Good.\n\nSimilarly, angle T is at vertex T. The sides:\n\n- Opposite angle T: SR (length sqrt(21))\n\n- Adjacent to angle T: ST (length 2)\n\n- Hypotenuse: RT (length 5)\n\nTherefore, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = SR/RT = sqrt(21)/5. Which is the same result as we got earlier through the complement angle. So, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is sqrt(21)/5, which in boxed form is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}.\n\nWait, let me just double-check. Since angle T is at point T, which is at (0,0). So, in triangle T, angle T connects sides TS and TR. TS is length 2, TR is hypotenuse 5, and SR is sqrt(21). So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, so sqrt(21)/5. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, since angle R and angle T are complementary, sin T = cos R, which is sqrt(21)/5. So, both methods confirm the answer. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the right-angled triangle \\( \\triangle RST \\) with a right angle at \\( S \\), we know that \\( \\sin R = \\frac{2}{5} \\).

The answer should be in the form √a/b where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Then I have to find a + b. Alright, let me start by recalling that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is given by the formula √(x² + y²). So, to minimize this distance, I can minimize the square of the distance, which is x² + y². That should make things easier because working with squares is simpler, and the square root is a monotonic function, so the minimum of the square corresponds to the minimum of the distance.\n\nGiven the equation y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute this into the distance squared formula. Let me write that out:\n\nDistance squared, D² = x² + y² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]².\n\nNow, let me compute that. First, expand the y² term:\n\n[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nSo, D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find the minimum value of this function D² with respect to x. To do that, I can take the derivative of D² with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then check if that critical point is indeed a minimum.\n\nLet me write D² as:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x^4 - 6x² + 9).\n\nWait, expanding (x² - 3)^2 gives x^4 - 6x² + 9. So, substituting that in:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x^4 - 6x² + 9) = x² + (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + (9/2).\n\nSimplifying the terms:\n\nx² - 3x² = -2x², so:\n\nD² = (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2.\n\nAlright, so now D² is a quartic function. Let's denote f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2. To find the minimum, take the derivative f’(x):\n\nf’(x) = (4/2)x³ - 4x = 2x³ - 4x.\n\nSet this equal to zero for critical points:\n\n2x³ - 4x = 0.\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x² - 2) = 0.\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 0 and x² = 2, which gives x = √2 and x = -√2.\n\nNow, we need to check which of these gives the minimum value of f(x). Let's evaluate f(x) at each critical point.\n\nFirst, at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nNext, at x = √2:\n\nf(√2) = (1/2)(√2)^4 - 2(√2)^2 + 9/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so (1/2)*4 = 2.\n\n(√2)^2 = 2, so 2*(2) = 4, but there's a negative sign: -4.\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (2 - 4) + 9/2 = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5 = 5/2.\n\nSimilarly, at x = -√2, since the function f(x) is even (only even powers of x), f(-√2) will also be 5/2.\n\nSo, the minimal value of D² is 5/2, achieved at x = ±√2. Therefore, the minimal distance is √(5/2) = √10 / 2. Wait, let me check that:\n\n√(5/2) can be written as √5 / √2, and rationalizing the denominator gives (√5 * √2) / (√2 * √2) = √10 / 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is √10 / 2. Therefore, in the form √a / b, we have a = 10 and b = 2. Now, check if a is square-free. 10 factors into 2 * 5, both primes, and neither 2 nor 5 are squared, so yes, 10 is square-free. Then a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the substitution of y into D²:\n\ny = (1/√2)(x² - 3), so y² = (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Then D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Then expanding (x² - 3)^2 gives x^4 - 6x² + 9, so D² = x² + (1/2)(x^4 -6x² +9) = x² + (1/2)x^4 -3x² + 9/2. Combining like terms: x² -3x² = -2x², so D² = (1/2)x^4 -2x² +9/2. Correct.\n\nTaking derivative: f’(x) = 2x³ -4x. Setting to zero: 2x³ -4x =0 => x(2x² -4)=0 => x=0 or x²=2. Correct.\n\nEvaluating f(x) at x=0: 9/2. At x=√2: (1/2)(4) -2*(2) +9/2 = 2 -4 +4.5=2.5=5/2. Correct. So minimal D² is 5/2, so D=√(5/2)=√10/2. So yes, a=10, b=2, a+b=12. Seems correct. But wait, let me check if there's any other critical points or if I missed something. The function D² is a quartic, so it's possible that there are more minima, but we checked all critical points. Since the leading term is (1/2)x^4, which tends to infinity as x approaches ±∞, the function should have a global minimum. We found two minima at x=±√2 and a maximum at x=0. Wait, but at x=0, D² is 9/2 which is 4.5, and at x=±√2, D² is 5/2 which is 2.5. So yes, 2.5 is smaller. So that's the minimum. So I think the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we need to minimize the distance squared function \\( D^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\).

Let me start by recalling that f inverse of a value y is the x such that f(x) = y. Since the function is piecewise, I need to check both pieces for each y to see where the solution might lie.\n\nFirst, let's tackle f inverse(0). That means I need to solve f(x) = 0 for x. The function is defined in two parts: for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x, and for x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. I should check each piece separately.\n\nStarting with the first piece, x ≤ 3: 3 - x = 0. Solving this, 3 - x = 0 → x = 3. Since x = 3 is indeed in the domain x ≤ 3, that's a valid solution. So one solution is x = 3. Now, I need to check if there's a solution in the second piece where x > 3: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Let me factor that equation.\n\nFirst, factor out an x: x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. So, either x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0. But since we're looking for x > 3, x = 0 is not in that domain. So we solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: x² - 2x - 3 = 0. Then factor the quadratic: (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. So solutions are x = 3 and x = -1. But x = 3 is the boundary point, which is already considered in the first piece, and x = -1 is not in x > 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in the second piece for f(x) = 0. So the only solution is x = 3. Therefore, f inverse(0) = 3.\n\nNow moving on to f inverse(6). Similarly, solve f(x) = 6. Again, check both pieces.\n\nFirst piece: x ≤ 3: 3 - x = 6 → -x = 3 → x = -3. Since -3 ≤ 3, this is valid. So x = -3 is a solution. Now check the second piece: x > 3, solve -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Let's rearrange this equation: -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0. Let's try to factor this cubic equation.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 6 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Let's test x = 1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0. x = 2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. So x = 2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (x - 2) out of the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's do synthetic division with root 2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -2 | -3 | 6\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: -2 + 2 = 0. Multiply by 2: 0. Add to next coefficient: -3 + 0 = -3. Multiply by 2: -6. Add to last coefficient: 6 + (-6) = 0. So the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 0x - 3) = (x - 2)(x² - 3). Therefore, x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = (x - 2)(x² - 3). Setting this equal to zero: x = 2, x = √3, x = -√3. Now, since we're looking for x > 3, check these roots. x = 2 is not in x > 3. x = √3 ≈ 1.732, which is also not in x > 3. x = -√3 ≈ -1.732, which is also not in x > 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in the second piece. Thus, the only solution is x = -3. Therefore, f inverse(6) = -3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. For f inverse(6), we found x = -3. But when x = -3, f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6, which is correct. So that's valid. However, let me check if there's another solution in x > 3. The cubic equation had roots at x = 2, which is less than 3, and x = ±√3, but those are still less than 3. So indeed, there are no solutions in x > 3. So f inverse(6) = -3.\n\nTherefore, f inverse(0) + f inverse(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. Wait, that's zero? Hmm, seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nFor f inverse(0):\n\nFirst piece: 3 - x = 0 → x = 3. Valid. Second piece: solving -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factored as x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. Solutions x=0, x=3, x=-1. x=3 is on the boundary, but x=3 is included in the first piece. So only x=3 is a solution. So f inverse(0)=3.\n\nFor f inverse(6):\n\nFirst piece: 3 - x =6 → x= -3. Valid. Second piece: solving -x³ + 2x² + 3x=6. Which led to x=2, x=±√3. All roots are less than or equal to 3, so no solutions in x>3. So f inverse(6)= -3.\n\nAdding them: 3 + (-3)=0. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the second equation again. For f inverse(6) in the second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x =6. So moving 6 to the left: -x³ + 2x² + 3x -6=0. Then multiplied by -1: x³ -2x² -3x +6=0. Then factored as (x-2)(x² -3). So roots at 2, sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). Indeed, none of these are greater than 3, so no solution. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the second piece, maybe x>3, the cubic could cross 6 again? Let me check the behavior of the function for x>3.\n\nTake the second piece: f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's compute its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing. f'(x) = -3x² +4x +3. For x>3, let's plug in x=4: f'(4)= -3*(16) +4*4 +3= -48 +16 +3= -29. Negative, so the function is decreasing at x=4. Since the leading term is -x³, as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. At x=3, the value is f(3) = -27 + 18 +9=0. So the function starts at x=3 with f(3)=0 and then decreases to negative infinity as x increases. Therefore, for x>3, f(x) is decreasing from 0 to negative infinity, so it never reaches 6 again. Therefore, there's no solution for f(x)=6 in x>3. So f inverse(6) is indeed -3.\n\nSimilarly, for f inverse(0), the first piece gives x=3, and the second piece would require f(x)=0, but in x>3, the function starts at 0 when x=3 and goes to negative infinity, so it doesn't reach 0 again.

For x=-3, which is in the first piece: f(-3)=3 - (-3)=6, which is correct. So f(-3)=6. And f(3)=0. So yes, f inverse(0)=3 and f inverse(6)=-3. Therefore, their sum is 0.\n\nI think that's correct.

So, we have a regular octahedron, which is like two square pyramids glued together at their bases. The problem says that the distances from a point P to five of its vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 triangular faces. Each vertex is connected to four others. The octahedron can be thought of as two pyramids with a square base, so it's dual to a cube. In coordinates, a regular octahedron can be represented with vertices at (0,0,±1), (0,±1,0), and (±1,0,0). So, each vertex is along one of the axes, either in the positive or negative direction.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. The coordinates probably are something like A=(1,0,0), B=(-1,0,0), C=(0,1,0), D=(0,-1,0), E=(0,0,1), F=(0,0,-1). So, each vertex is on a different axis. Then, point P is at (1.2,1.5,1), which is outside the octahedron. The lines connecting P to each vertex are red.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that in a regular octahedron, the vertices come in opposite pairs. So, A and B are opposites, C and D are opposites, E and F are opposites. So, if P is connected to all six vertices, the distances to opposite vertices might be related. Maybe there's some symmetry here.\n\nBut the problem states that the distances from P to five vertices are 3,7,8,9,11, and we need the sixth. So, perhaps there's a relationship between the distances to opposite vertices? Let me think.\n\nI remember that in some cases, especially with dual polyhedrons or symmetries, there might be reciprocal relations. But octahedrons and spheres... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the distances from a point inside the octahedron to all its vertices. Wait, but the octahedron is convex, so any point inside would have all distances positive, but how do they relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates. If we can assign coordinates to point P, then compute the distances to all vertices. But since we don't know the coordinates of P, except that it's at (1.2,1.5,1) in the Asymptote code, but that's just for drawing. The actual coordinates might be different. Wait, the Asymptote code is just a projection, so the coordinates in the code are for drawing purposes only.\n\nWait, maybe we need to use the fact that in a regular octahedron, the distance from any vertex to the center is the same. The center is at (0,0,0). The distance from the center to each vertex is 1 in the Asymptote code, since A is (1,0,0), etc. But in reality, the edge length of the octahedron would be the distance between adjacent vertices. Let's compute that. For example, the distance between A=(1,0,0) and C=(0,1,0) is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(2). So, the edge length is sqrt(2). But maybe the actual edge length is different. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the size of the octahedron, so maybe the coordinates in the Asymptote code are just for illustration, not to scale.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to assume the octahedron is regular but not necessarily of unit side length. Let me denote the regular octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±k), for some k. Wait, but in a regular octahedron, all edges are equal. Let me check.\n\nIf we take vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1), then the edges would be between these points. For example, the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is sqrt(2), and the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,0,1) is sqrt(2). The distance between (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0) is 2. Wait, but in a regular octahedron, all edges should be equal. But in this case, edges along the axes are length 2, and edges on the faces are length sqrt(2). So, that's not a regular octahedron. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the coordinates should be different. Let's think again. A regular octahedron can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (±a, 0, 0), (0, ±a, 0), (0, 0, ±b). For it to be regular, all edges must have the same length. Let's compute the edge lengths.\n\nThe edges between (a,0,0) and (0,a,0) would have length sqrt((a)^2 + (-a)^2) = sqrt(2 a²) = a sqrt(2).\n\nThe edges between (a,0,0) and (0,0,b) would have length sqrt(a² + b²).\n\nSince all edges must be equal, so a sqrt(2) = sqrt(a² + b²). Squaring both sides: 2 a² = a² + b² => a² = b² => a = b (since lengths are positive). So, if we set a = b, then all edges are equal. Therefore, a regular octahedron can have vertices at (±a, 0, 0), (0, ±a, 0), (0, 0, ±a). Wait, but that's a cube with edges along the axes, but with vertices at the centers of the cube's faces. Wait, actually, no. If a = b, then the distance from (a,0,0) to (0,a,0) is a sqrt(2), and the distance from (a,0,0) to (0,0,a) is sqrt(a² + a²) = a sqrt(2). So, all edges are a sqrt(2). Therefore, if we set a = 1, then the edge length is sqrt(2). So, the regular octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). That must be the standard regular octahedron.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are A=(1,0,0), B=(-1,0,0), etc., so that's the standard one. But in the problem, the distances from P to five vertices are 3,7,8,9,11. If the octahedron is of unit edge length, then the distances from an external point can be up to, say, 2 (if P is at a vertex), but 11 is much larger. So, maybe the octahedron is scaled up. But the problem doesn't mention scaling, so maybe we need to find a relationship that works regardless of size.\n\nWait, but the problem is in 3D space, so maybe there's a formula similar to the British flag theorem, which is for rectangles in 2D. The British flag theorem says that for any point P in the plane of a rectangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to two opposite corners is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances to the other two opposite corners. Maybe there's a 3D version for octahedrons?\n\nAlternatively, since the octahedron is dual to the cube, perhaps we can use properties of cubes. Wait, but the octahedron has opposite vertices, so if we consider the center of the octahedron (which is the origin), then each vertex is at (±1,0,0), etc. So, maybe if P is a point in space, then the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex relates to the distance from P to the center?\n\nWait, let's think. Let’s suppose the octahedron is centered at the origin with vertices at (±1,0,0), (0,±1,0), (0,0,±1). Let’s denote point P as (x,y,z). Then, the distance from P to each vertex can be written as sqrt((x ±1)^2 + y^2 + z^2) for the vertices along the x-axis, sqrt(x^2 + (y ±1)^2 + z^2) for the y-axis vertices, and sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z ±1)^2) for the z-axis vertices.\n\nIf we consider the sum of the squares of these distances, maybe there's a simplification. Let's compute the square of the distance to (1,0,0): (x -1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x² - 2x +1 + y² + z². Similarly, distance to (-1,0,0): (x +1)^2 + y² + z² = x² + 2x +1 + y² + z². Adding these two gives 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2. Similarly, for the y-axis vertices, distance to (0,1,0)^2 is x² + (y -1)^2 + z², and to (0,-1,0)^2 is x² + (y +1)^2 + z². Adding these gives 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2. Same for the z-axis vertices. So, if we add all eight distances squared, we get 4*(2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2) = 8x² + 8y² + 8z² + 8. \n\nAlternatively, if we denote S = sum of squares of distances from P to all vertices, then S = 8(x² + y² + z²) + 8. \n\nBut if the octahedron is scaled by a factor of k, then all coordinates are multiplied by k, so x, y, z become kx, ky, kz, and the sum S would become 8(kx)^2 + 8(ky)^2 + 8(kz)^2 + 8 = 8k²(x² + y² + z²) + 8. But maybe this isn't helpful unless we know the scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is related to the concept of the \"distance from a point to the vertices\" and there's a relation that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to some value. Wait, but in the case of the octahedron, since it's regular, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the distance from the point to the center.\n\nWait, let's see. If the center is the origin, then the distance from P to the center is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Let's denote that as d. Then, each distance squared to a vertex is (distance from P to vertex)^2 = (x ± 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x² ± 2x +1 + y² + z² = d² ± 2x +1. Similarly for other vertices. Wait, but that complicates things. However, if we sum all the squares of the distances:\n\nSum = [ (x -1)^2 + y² + z² ] + [ (x +1)^2 + y² + z² ] + [ x² + (y -1)^2 + z² ] + [ x² + (y +1)^2 + z² ] + [ x² + y² + (z -1)^2 ] + [ x² + y² + (z +1)^2 ]\n\nCompute this sum:\n\nFor x-axis vertices: (x-1)^2 + (x+1)^2 = (x² - 2x +1) + (x² + 2x +1) = 2x² + 2\n\nSimilarly, for y-axis vertices: 2y² + 2\n\nFor z-axis vertices: 2z² + 2\n\nTotal sum = 2x² + 2 + 2y² + 2 + 2z² + 2 = 2(x² + y² + z²) + 6\n\nBut x² + y² + z² is d², so sum = 2d² + 6\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered all eight distances, I had 8x² + 8y² + 8z² + 8. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, in the octahedron, there are six vertices, not eight. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake there. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the octahedron has six vertices: (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,-1). So, six vertices. Therefore, when we compute the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices, it should be:\n\nFor each vertex:\n\n1. (1,0,0): (x -1)^2 + y² + z²\n2. (-1,0,0): (x +1)^2 + y² + z²\n3. (0,1,0): x² + (y -1)^2 + z²\n4. (0,-1,0): x² + (y +1)^2 + z²\n5. (0,0,1): x² + y² + (z -1)^2\n6. (0,0,-1): x² + y² + (z +1)^2\n\nSo, sum all these:\n\nSum = [(x -1)^2 + (x +1)^2] + [(y -1)^2 + (y +1)^2] + [(z -1)^2 + (z +1)^2] + 3x² + 3y² + 3z²\n\nWait, no. Let's compute each pair:\n\nFor x-axis:\n\n1. (x -1)^2 + y² + z²\n2. (x +1)^2 + y² + z²\nSum: (x² - 2x +1 + y² + z", "answer": "\\sqrt{66}"}

The question is asking for the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball. Both are using the formula F = ma, right? Force equals mass times acceleration.\n\nLet me make sure I understand. They want the ratio of accelerations, asoftball / a_baseball. And they want it as a simplified fraction. The masses are given: 200 grams for the softball and 150 grams for the baseball. Wait, grams? Hmm, but in physics, usually we use kilograms. But maybe since both are in grams, it's okay. Let me check the units.\n\nSo, the force is the same for both. So F = m_jen * a_jen = m_jack * a_jack. Therefore, m_jen * a_jen = m_jack * a_jack. So, solving for the ratio a_jen / a_jack = m_jack / m_jen. Because if you divide both sides by m_jen * a_jack, you get a_jen / a_jack = m_jack / m_jen. So the ratio would be mass of Jack divided by mass of Jen.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball in relation to Jack's baseball\". So is it a_jen / a_jack or the other way around? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the question says \"quanto a aceleração da bola de Jen em comparação com a de Jack\". The Portuguese phrasing might be clearer, but in English, \"the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball in relation to Jack's baseball\" could mean a_jen / a_jack. But maybe they just want the ratio regardless of order. Let me think.\n\nBut according to the formula, if F is the same, then a = F/m. So the acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. So if Jen's ball is heavier (200g vs 150g), her acceleration should be less. So the ratio a_jen / a_jack = (F/m_jen) / (F/m_jack) = m_jack / m_jen = 150/200 = 3/4. So the ratio is 3/4. So the answer is 3/4. But let me verify.\n\nWait, let's write it step by step. Since F = m_jen * a_jen = m_jack * a_jack. Therefore, a_jen = F / m_jen and a_jack = F / m_jack. Therefore, the ratio a_jen / a_jack = (F / m_jen) / (F / m_jack) = m_jack / m_jen. Since the masses are 150g and 200g, the ratio is 150/200, which simplifies to 3/4. So yes, the ratio is 3/4. So Jen's acceleration is 3/4 of Jack's. So the answer is 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if they wanted a_jack / a_jen, it would be 4/3, but the problem says \"the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball in relation to Jack's baseball\". That phrasing is a bit unclear. But in standard ratio phrasing, \"in relation to\" usually means the first mentioned comes first. But the problem might be in Portuguese, and the translation might be slightly off. But given that in physics, when we talk about the ratio of a to b, it's a/b. So if it's \"the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball in relation to Jack's baseball\", it's a_jen / a_jack. Which would be 3/4.

Por exemplo, $121_{3}$ e $413_{5}$ teriam um dígito em comum.", "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the number of common digits between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number 629. The example given is 121 base 3 and 413 base 5, which share the digit 1. Okay, so first, I need to convert 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8. Then, compare the digits of both representations and count how many are the same. \n\nLet me start with converting 629 to base 7. To do that, I'll divide 629 by 7 repeatedly and note the remainders.\n\nFirst division: 629 divided by 7. Let's see, 7*89 is 623, right? Because 7*90 is 630, so 630 -7 is 623. So, 629 minus 623 is 6. So, the first remainder is 6. Then, the quotient is 89. \n\nNext, divide 89 by 7. 7*12 is 84, so 89 -84 is 5. So, next remainder is 5. Quotient is 12.\n\nThen, divide 12 by 7. 7*1 is 7, remainder 5. Quotient is 1.\n\nDivide 1 by 7. That's 0 with remainder 1. So, the remainders, from last to first, are 1, 5, 5, 6. Therefore, 629 in base 7 is 1556_7. Let me check that again. Wait: 1*7^3 = 343, 5*7^2 = 245, 5*7 = 35, 6*1 = 6. 343 +245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, converting 629 to base 8. Let's do the same process. Divide 629 by 8.\n\n8*78 is 624, since 8*80 is 640, subtract 8*2=16, so 640-16=624. So, 629 -624=5. Remainder is 5. Quotient is 78.\n\nDivide 78 by 8. 8*9=72, remainder 6. Quotient is 9.\n\nDivide 9 by 8. 8*1=8, remainder 1. Quotient is 1.\n\nDivide 1 by 8. That's 0 with remainder 1. So, writing the remainders from last to first, we get 1, 1, 6, 5. So, 629 in base 8 is 1165_8. Let me verify: 1*8^3=512, 1*8^2=64, 6*8=48, 5*1=5. 512+64=576, 576+48=624, 624+5=629. Correct.\n\nSo now we have both representations:\n\nBase 7: 1 5 5 6 (digits: 1,5,5,6)\n\nBase 8: 1 1 6 5 (digits:1,1,6,5)\n\nNow, let's list all the digits in each:\n\nBase 7 digits: 1, 5, 5, 6\n\nBase 8 digits: 1, 1, 6, 5\n\nNow, we need to compare these digits. Let's list the digits from both bases and see which ones are overlapping.\n\nFirst, list all digits in base 7: 1, 5, 6. Note that 5 is repeated twice, but we are only interested in unique digits. Similarly, in base 8, digits are 1, 1, 6, 5. Again, unique digits are 1, 6, 5. Wait, so both bases have the same digits? Let me check:\n\nBase 7 digits: 1, 5, 5, 6. Unique digits: 1,5,6\n\nBase 8 digits: 1,1,6,5. Unique digits:1,6,5\n\nSo, all digits in base 7 are the same as in base 8. Therefore, all three unique digits (1,5,6) are present in both representations. But wait, how many times do they appear?\n\nWait, the question says \"Quantos dos mesmos dígitos são foundadosanas representações em base 7 e base 8\". So, the question is how many digits are common between the two representations. But, in the example, they considered the digit 1 in 121_3 and 413_5, even though 1 appears twice in the first and once in the second. So, they counted the number of digits that are the same in the same position? Wait, no, in the example, they just said \"a dígitos em comum\", so maybe they count the number of digits that are the same regardless of their position. Wait, but in the example, 121_3 and 413_5, the digits 1 and 3 (wait, no, the digits are 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. So the common digits are 1. So, the digit 1 appears in the same position in both? Wait, in the example, 121_3 is 1-2-1 and 413_5 is 4-1-3. So the digit 1 is in the second position in both. So they count that as a common digit. So maybe when comparing the two numbers, each digit position is considered, and if the digit is the same in the same position, then it's counted. Otherwise, if they have same digits but in different positions, does that count? The example counts 1 as a common digit because it's the same digit in the same position. So perhaps the problem counts the number of digits that are the same in the same position. So, in the example, 121_3 and 413_5: first digit 1 vs 4 (different), second digit 2 vs 1 (different), third digit 1 vs 3 (different). Wait, but the example says \"a dígitos em comum\", but the example given is 121_3 and 413_5, which have the digit 1 in the middle. So, even though 1 is in the middle in both, but in different numbers. Wait, but 121_3 is a number and 413_5 is another number. So the digits are in different positions. So the example is saying that even though the digit 1 is present in both numbers, but in different positions, but they consider the digit 1 as a common digit. Wait, but 121_3 has digits 1, 2, 1 and 413_5 has digits 4, 1, 3. So the digit 1 is present in both numbers, but in different positions. However, the problem statement says \"Quantos dos mesmos dígitos são foundadosanas representações em base 7 e base 8\". The Portuguese \"dígitos em comum\" likely means \"digits common to both representations\". So, if a digit appears in both representations, regardless of position, how many times does it appear in each, but the count is just the number of distinct digits that are present in both representations. Wait, but in the example, they have 121_3 and 413_5. So digits are 1,2,1 vs 4,1,3. The common digits are 1. So even though 1 appears twice in the first number and once in the second, they only count the number of distinct digits that are present in both, which is 1. So it's 1 occurrence. Wait, but in the example, maybe they count the number of digits that are the same in the same position? But the example doesn't specify. Wait, the problem statement is in Portuguese: \"Quantos dos mesmos dígitos são foundadosanas representações em base 7 e base 8 de 629_{10}?\" So \"dígitos em comum\" means \"common digits\". So in the example, the two numbers have digits 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. The common digit is 1. So they count the number of common digits, regardless of their position. So in the example, it's 1. So in the problem, we need to find how many distinct digits are common to both base 7 and base 8 representations of 629. So, if both representations have digits 1,5,6, then the answer is 3. But let me check. Let's look at the base 7: 1556, so digits are 1,5,5,6. Base 8: 1165, digits are 1,1,6,5. So the digits in base 7 are 1,5,6. The digits in base 8 are 1,6,5. So all the same digits. Therefore, all three digits 1,5,6 are present in both representations. So the answer should be 3. But let me make sure. Wait, but in base 7, the digits are 1,5,5,6. So 1 appears once, 5 appears twice, 6 once. In base 8, 1 appears twice, 6 once, 5 once. So the common digits are 1,5,6. Each of these digits is present in both representations. So even though their counts differ, the problem is asking for how many digits are common, not how many times. So the answer is 3. But let me check the example again. The example is 121_3 and 413_5. The digits are 1,2,1 vs 4,1,3. The common digit is 1. So even though 1 appears twice in the first number, the common digit is just 1. So in the problem, the answer would be 3, since 1,5,6 are present in both. But let me check if that's correct. Wait, but in base 7, digits are 1,5,5,6. In base 8, digits are 1,1,6,5. So all three digits 1,5,6 are present in both. Therefore, the answer is 3. But maybe the problem is asking for the number of digits that are the same in the same position? For example, in the example, the middle digit is 2 in the first and 1 in the second, which are different, so not counted. So only the digit 1 is in the same position. So in the problem, if we look at 1556 (base7) and 1165 (base8), the digits are: 1 (position 1), 5 (position 2), 5 (position3), 6 (position4) vs 1 (position1),1 (position2),6 (position3),5 (position4). So comparing each position:\n\nPosition1: 1 vs 1 – same, count 1\n\nPosition2: 5 vs 1 – different\n\nPosition3:5 vs6 – different\n\nPosition4:6 vs5 – different\n\nSo only one digit is the same in the same position. So in the example, the answer would be 1. So the problem might be asking for the number of digits that are the same in the same position. So in the problem statement, the example counts 1 as the common digit because it is in the same position in both numbers. Therefore, in the problem, we need to check each digit position and count how many digits are the same in the same position. So let's do that. Let's write both numbers aligned:\n\nBase7: 1 5 5 6\n\nBase8: 1 1 6 5\n\nComparing digit by digit:\n\nPosition1: 1 vs 1 – same\n\nPosition2:5 vs1 – different\n\nPosition3:5 vs6 – different\n\nPosition4:6 vs5 – different\n\nSo only one digit is the same in the same position. Therefore, the answer would be 1. But wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. So which is it?\n\nThe problem statement says: \"Quantos dos mesmos dígitos são foundadosanas representações em base 7 e base 8 de 629_{10}?\" The Portuguese \"dígitos em comum\" is \"common digits\". So if it's just the count of distinct digits present in both representations, then it's 3. But if it's the number of digits that are the same in the same position, then it's 1. The example given is 121_3 and 413_5, which have the digit 1 in the middle of both, so they count that as a common digit. So in that case, they are counting the number of digits that are the same in the same position. Therefore, in the problem, the answer is 1. But let's check the example again. The example says \"121_{3} e 413_{5} teriam um dígitgo em comum\". So \"um dígitgo\" meaning \"one digit\". So they count the number of digits that are the same in the same position. Therefore, in the problem, we need to do the same: compare each digit in the same position and count how many are the same. So in our case, 1556 (base7) and 1165 (base8):\n\nPosition1: 1 vs1 – same\n\nPosition2:5 vs1 – different\n\nPosition3:5 vs6 – different\n\nPosition4:6 vs5 – different\n\nSo only the first digit is the same. Therefore, the answer is 1. But wait, let's check the problem statement again. It says: \"Quantos dos mesmos dígitos são foundadosanas representações em base 7 e base 8 de 629_{10}?\" So \"dígitos em comum\" – common digits. The example uses the plural \"dígitos\", but in the example, only one digit is common. Wait, the example says: \"121_{3} e 413_{5} teriamum dígitgo em comum\". So \"um dígitgo\" (one", "answer": "3"}

None of the bruxas were concerned about hugging each other since they are all good friends, and the feiticeios are a bit mean and don't hug each other back. The question is, how many hugs occurred in total?\n\nHmm. So first, I need to figure out how many hugs each group did to the other. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the bruxas. There are 6 of them, and each bruxa hugs each feiticeiro. So if there are 10 feiticeios, each bruxa has to hug all 10. So for each bruxa, that's 10 hugs. Since there are 6 bruxas, the total number of hugs from the bruxas to the feiticeios would be 6 multiplied by 10. Let me write that down: 6 * 10 = 60. So that's 60 hugs from bruxas to feiticeios.\n\nNow, the feiticeios. There are 10 feiticeios, but none of them hug each other. So each feiticeiro doesn't hug any other feiticeiro. Also, the problem states that the feiticeios \"meio que seodeiam\" which I think translates to \"a bit mean\" or \"not that bad,\" but the key point is they don't hug each other. So how many hugs do the feiticeios do to the bruxas? The problem says \"nၙira pula as mankin de cada um dos feiticeios.\" Wait, maybe I need to check the original Portuguese.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Seis bruxas eLLUfeiticeiroSanguemna reunião arcana. As bruxas决定 apertar as mãos de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Nenéa das bruxas se preocolpham em apertar as mãos umas das outropes feiticeiroS, ya que todas already são boas amigas, e os feiticeiroS mean que seodeiam e não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Quantos apados de mão ocorreS na reunião?\"\n\nWait, actually, the user might have made a typo in the translation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in Portuguese:\n\n\"Seis bruxas e dez feiticeiroS são em uma reunião arcana. As bruxas.QLabelar as mãos de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Nenáa das bruxas se preocolpham em apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS, ya que todas já são boas amigas, e os feiticeiroS meio que seodeiam e não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Quantos apados de mão ocorreS na reunião?\"\n\nHmm. Let me parse this again. The key part is:\n\n\"As bruxas决定 apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So, the bruxas decided to hug each of the feiticeios. Then, \"Nenáa das bruxas se preocolpham em apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS, ya que todas já são boas amigas, e os feiticeiroS meio que seodeiam e não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\"\n\nSo, the bruxas didn't pre靴ar (they weren't preoccupied) with hugging each other because they are all good friends, and the feiticeios are a bit mean and don't hug each other. So the feiticeios do not hug each other, but do they hug the bruxas?\n\nWait, the problem says \"As bruxasensapertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So the bruxas do hug each feiticeiro. The feiticeios are not huging each other. But does each feiticeiro hug the bruxas back?\n\nWait, in Portuguese, \"apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS\" could be ambiguous. Does \"mankin\" refer to the hands or the heads? Probably hands. So if the bruxas hug each feiticeiro, does each feiticeiro hug the bruxas back?\n\nIn the problem statement, the bruxas didn't preOCOPHAT (pre:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PreOCOPHAT) with hugging each other, but the feiticeios don't hug each other either. So, if each bruxa hugs each feiticeiro, and each feiticeiro is being hugged by all bruxas, then the total number of hugs from bruxas to feiticeios is 6*10=60.\n\nBut then, do the feiticeios hug back? The problem says \"não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So \"não apertam\" meaning they do not hug. So the feiticeios do not hug each other, but do they hug the bruxas?\n\nIn Portuguese, \"apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS\" – if the mankin is the hand, then \"apertar as mankin\" would mean hugging the hands. So if the bruxas are hugging the feiticeios, does that mean they are also hugging the feiticeios' hands? So the bruxas are hugging each feiticeiro's hand, and the feiticeios are not hugging each other's hands, nor are they hugging the bruxas' hands? Wait, but the problem says \"As bruxasensapertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So maybe each bruxa is hugging each feiticeiro's hand once. So each of the 6 bruxas hugging each of the 10 feiticeios once, totaling 60 hugs. The feiticeios are not hugging each other, nor are they hugging the bruxas back. So the total number of hugs is 60.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Seis bruxas e dez feiticeiroS são em uma reunião arcana. As bruxasasticsapertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Nenáa das bruxas se preocolpham em apertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS, ya que todas já são boas amigas, e os feiticeiroS meio que seodeiam e não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS. Quantos apados de mão ocorreS na reunião?\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. 6 bruxas and 10 feiticeios at the meeting.\n\n2. Bruxas decided to hug each of the feiticeios.\n\n3. None of the bruxas preOCOPHAT (preoccupied) with hugging each other, since they are all good friends.\n\n4. Feiticeios are a bit mean and don't hug each other.\n\n5. The question is how many hugs occurred.\n\nSo, the key is: do the feiticeios hug the bruxas back? The problem states that \"os feiticeiroS meio que seodeiam e não apertam as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So \"não apertam\" meaning they do not hug. Therefore, the feiticeios do not hug each other, nor do they hug the bruxas. Only the bruxas hug the feiticeios. Since there's no mention of the feiticeios hugging the bruxas, we can assume that only the bruxas are doing the hugging, and the feiticeios are passive.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hugs is 6 bruxas each hugging 10 feiticeios, so 6*10=60. The feiticeios are not contributing any hugs. The bruxas are not hugging each other. Therefore, the total is 60.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"As bruxasensapertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So \"sapertar\" means to hug, right? So each bruxa is hugging each feiticeiro. So each of the 6 bruxas is doing 10 hugs, totaling 60. The feiticeios are not hugging anyone, not each other, not the bruxas. So yes, 60.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in these problems, when two groups interact, sometimes it's expected that each person from one group does something to everyone in the other group, but maybe in the reverse too. But in this case, the problem specifically says \"As bruxasensapertar as mankin de cada um dos feiticeiroS.\" So it's explicitly stated that the bruxas are hugging the feiticeios, not the other way around. Also, the feiticeios are not mentioned to be hugging anyone. So unless there's a translation issue, the answer should be 6*10=60.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in Portuguese, and \"mankin\" is the head? But \"mankin\" in Portuguese is \"manhão\" or \"m�kining,\" which is the head or the front of the head. But hugging the head is less common. But regardless, the action is still between two people. If a bruxa hugs a feiticeiro's head, that's one hug. If the feiticeiro doesn't hug back, then it's one way. So 6*10=60.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 60, which in boxed form is \\boxed{60}.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves 6 bruxas and 10 feiticeios at a meeting. Each bruxa hugs every feiticeiro, but feiticeios do not hug each other or the bruxas. \n\n1. **Total hugs from bruxas to feiticeios**: Each of the 6 bruxas hugs each of the 10 feiticeios. This results in \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\) hugs.\n2. **No hugs from feiticeios**: Feiticeios do not hug each other or the bruxas, as stated in the problem.\n\nThus, the total number of hugs is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).", "answer": "60"}

The original polynomial f(x) is given as 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. That's because when you plug in 1 for x, each term becomes just the coefficient times 1 raised to some power, which is 1. So, for example, the coefficient of x⁴ is multiplied by 1⁴, which is 1, so it stays the same. Similarly, all the other terms would just be their coefficients. Therefore, evaluating f(1) gives the sum of the coefficients of f(x). But here, the polynomial we're dealing with is g(x) = f(x - 1). So, we need to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x), which would be g(1). \n\nWait, so if I can find g(1), that's the sum of the coefficients. But g(x) is f(x - 1), so substituting x = 1 into g(x) gives f(1 - 1) = f(0). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is f(0). Is that right? Let me verify.\n\nYes, because g(x) = f(x - 1), so the coefficients of g(x) are just a shifted version of f(x). But when we evaluate g(1), which is f(0), that's equivalent to substituting x = 0 into the original f(x). But f(0) would be the constant term of f(x). Wait, but is that the sum of the coefficients? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if I have a polynomial h(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0, then the sum of the coefficients is h(1) = a_n + a_{n-1} + ... + a_1 + a_0. So, to get the sum of the coefficients, we evaluate at x = 1. Therefore, for g(x) = f(x - 1), the sum of its coefficients is g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). Therefore, the answer is f(0). Let me compute f(0):\n\nf(x) = 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Plugging in x = 0:\n\n3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can expand g(x) = f(x - 1) and then sum the coefficients. Let's try that approach as a check.\n\nFirst, let's write out f(x - 1). The original f(x) is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. So, substituting x - 1 into f:\n\nf(x - 1) = 3*(x - 1)^4 + 5*(x - 1)^2 - 9*(x - 1) - 2.\n\nNow, let's expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 3*(x - 1)^4.\n\nLet me compute (x - 1)^4. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1. Multiply by 3:\n\n3x^4 - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.\n\nSecond term: 5*(x - 1)^2.\n\nCompute (x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5:\n\n5x² - 10x + 5.\n\nThird term: -9*(x - 1).\n\nThat's -9x + 9.\n\nFourth term: -2.\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\nFirst term: 3x⁴ -12x³ +18x² -12x +3\n\nSecond term: +5x² -10x +5\n\nThird term: -9x +9\n\nFourth term: -2\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n3x⁴\n\nThen, -12x³\n\nThen, 18x² +5x² = 23x²\n\nThen, -12x -10x -9x = (-12 -10 -9)x = -31x\n\nThen, constants: 3 +5 +9 -2 = (3+5)=8; 8+9=17; 17-2=15.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ng(x) = 3x⁴ -12x³ +23x² -31x +15.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients is when we plug in x =1:\n\ng(1) = 3*(1)^4 -12*(1)^3 +23*(1)^2 -31*(1) +15 = 3 -12 +23 -31 +15.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n3 -12 = -9\n\n-9 +23 = 14\n\n14 -31 = -17\n\n-17 +15 = -2.\n\nSo, that's indeed -2. So, the sum of the coefficients is -2, which matches the previous method. Therefore, the answer is -2. Therefore, I can confirm that both methods lead to the same result. So, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the coefficients of \\( g \\) is \\boxed{-2}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\), which is equal to \\( f(x-1) \\), we need to evaluate \\( g(1) \\).

Expresse sua resposta na forma mais simples de radical.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the minimal distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2. Hmm, let me think. I remember there's a formula for the distance from a point to a line in coordinate geometry. Is it something like |Ax + By + C| divided by the square root of (A² + B²)? Wait, right! The formula is |Ax₁ + By₁ + C| / sqrt(A² + B²), where (x₁, y₁) is the point and Ax + By + C = 0 is the line.\n\nFirst, I need to write the given line equation in the standard form Ax + By + C = 0. The given line is y = 2x - 2. Let me rearrange that. Subtract 2x and add 2 to both sides: -2x + y + 2 = 0. So, A is -2, B is 1, and C is 2. But wait, does the formula use Ax + By + C = 0? Let me check again. Yes, so in this case, the equation is -2x + y + 2 = 0. So A = -2, B = 1, C = 2.\n\nNow, the point is (6, 0). Plugging into the distance formula: |A*6 + B*0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²) = |-2*6 + 1*0 + 2| / sqrt((-2)² + 1²) = |-12 + 0 + 2| / sqrt(4 + 1) = |-10| / sqrt(5) = 10 / sqrt(5). But I need to rationalize the denominator, right? Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (10*sqrt(5)) / (sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)) = (10√5)/5 = 2√5. So the minimal distance is 2√5. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me verify using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to find the minimal distance is by finding the perpendicular distance from the point to the line. So, perhaps parametrize the line and use calculus to minimize the distance. Let's try that.\n\nThe line is y = 2x - 2. Let me represent any point on the line as (t, 2t - 2) where t is a parameter. Then, the distance between (6, 0) and (t, 2t - 2) is sqrt[(t - 6)^2 + (2t - 2 - 0)^2]. To minimize the distance, it's equivalent to minimize the square of the distance, which is (t - 6)^2 + (2t - 2)^2.\n\nLet me compute that: (t² - 12t + 36) + (4t² - 8t + 4) = 5t² - 20t + 40. To find the minimum, take derivative with respect to t: d/dt [5t² - 20t + 40] = 10t - 20. Set derivative equal to zero: 10t - 20 = 0 => t = 2. Then, substitute t = 2 back into the point on the line: (2, 2*2 - 2) = (2, 2). Now, the distance from (6, 0) to (2, 2) is sqrt[(6 - 2)^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = sqrt[16 + 4] = sqrt[20] = 2√5. So that matches the previous result. Okay, so that's good. Both methods give the same answer, so I think 2√5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors? Let me try that approach. The direction vector of the line y = 2x - 2 can be found. Since the slope is 2, a direction vector would be (1, 2). The vector from a point on the line to (6, 0) is (6 - x, -y). Wait, maybe I need a more systematic approach. The formula for the distance from a point to a line using vectors is |(v × w)| / |v|, where v is the direction vector of the line and w is the vector from a point on the line to the external point.\n\nLet me set a point on the line. Let's take x = 0, then y = -2. So the point is (0, -2). The vector from (0, -2) to (6, 0) is (6 - 0, 0 - (-2)) = (6, 2). The direction vector of the line is (1, 2). The cross product in 2D is scalar magnitude given by (6)(2) - (2)(1) = 12 - 2 = 10. The magnitude of the direction vector is sqrt(1² + 2²) = sqrt(5). So the distance is |10| / sqrt(5) = 10 / sqrt(5) = 2√5. Again, same answer. So all methods confirm that the minimal distance is 2√5. \n\nI think that's solid. The answer is 2√5. Let me just check once more. If I plug x = 6 into the line equation y = 2x - 2, y would be 10. So the point (6, 10) is on the line. The distance from (6, 0) to (6, 10) is 10, which is vertical distance. But that's not the minimal distance. The minimal distance should be a straight line perpendicular to the line y = 2x - 2. Since the slope of the given line is 2, the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/2. So the equation of the line perpendicular to y = 2x - 2 passing through (6, 0) is y - 0 = -1/2(x - 6), which is y = -1/2x + 3. Now, find the intersection point between y = 2x - 2 and y = -1/2x + 3.\n\nSet 2x - 2 = -1/2x + 3. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction: 4x - 4 = -x + 6. Bring all terms to left: 4x -4 + x -6 = 0 => 5x -10 = 0 => 5x =10 => x=2. Then y = 2(2) -2 = 2. So the intersection point is (2, 2), which is the same as before. Distance from (6,0) to (2,2) is sqrt[(6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2] = sqrt[16 +4] = sqrt[20] = 2√5. Yep, same result. So all methods lead to the same answer. I think I can confidently say the minimal distance is 2√5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimal distance is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimal distance from the point \\((6, 0)\\) to the line \\(y = 2x - 2\\), we use the formula for the distance from a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to a line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we rewrite the line equation \\(y = 2x - 2\\) in standard form \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n-2x + y + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(A = -2\\), \\(B = 1\\), and \\(C = 2\\). Plugging the point \\((6, 0)\\) into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\frac{|-2 \\cdot 6 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 2|}{\\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \\frac{|-10|}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we use another method by finding the perpendicular distance. Parametrize the line as \\((t, 2t - 2)\\). The distance squared from \\((6, 0)\\) to \\((t, 2t - 2)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(t - 6)^2 + (2t - 2)^2 = 5t^2 - 20t + 40\n\\]\n\nTaking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\n\\[\n10t - 20 = 0 \\implies t = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(t = 2\\) back into the line gives the point \\((2, 2)\\). The distance from \\((6, 0)\\) to \\((2, 2)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(6 - 2)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm the minimal distance is \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]", "answer": "2\\sqrt{5}"}

The roots are \\( \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4 \\), and they're all distinct. The expressions are \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 \\), \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 \\), and \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 \\). The question is asking for the set of these three values, which I guess doesn't consider the order, just the distinct values among them.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, there are things called symmetric sums of roots. Maybe I can use Vieta's formulas here. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a quartic equation \\( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0 \\), the sums of the roots are:\n\n- \\( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 = -a \\)\n- \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = b \\)\n- \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = -c \\)\n- \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = d \\)\n\nIn our case, the polynomial is \\( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \\). So comparing to the general form, \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( d = 2 \\). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the general quartic is \\( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d \\). Our given polynomial is \\( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 \\). So actually, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term)\n- \\( c = 0 \\) (no \\( x \\) term)\n- \\( d = 2 \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Sum of roots: \\( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 = -a = -2 \\)\n- Sum of products two at a time: \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = b = 0 \\)\n- Sum of products three at a time: \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = -c = 0 \\)\n- Product of all roots: \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = d = 2 \\)\n\nBut the problem is asking for the values of three different combinations of products: \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 \\), \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 \\), and \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 \\). These are symmetric sums, but not the same as the elementary symmetric sums given by Vieta. So maybe I need to relate these expressions to the known sums from Vieta.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s call \\( S_1 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 \\)\n\n\\( S_2 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 \\)\n\n\\( S_3 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 \\)\n\nWe need to find the set \\( \\{ S_1, S_2, S_3 \\} \\).\n\nI remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric expressions, we can consider the square of the sum of the roots or other symmetric expressions. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe consider that the sum \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \\) might be related to the sum of products two at a time.\n\nWait, let's compute \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \\):\n\n\\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4) + (\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4) + (\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3) \\)\n\nBut if we expand this, we get all the possible products of two roots, right? Because each pair is covered once:\n\n\\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the sum \\( \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = b = 0 \\). So \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \\).\n\nSo the sum of the three expressions is zero. That might be helpful.\n\nNow, maybe I can find another equation involving \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\). Let me think. Perhaps by considering \\( (S_1)(S_2)(S_3) \\), or \\( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \\), but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps consider the product \\( S_1 S_2 S_3 \\). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the product of the roots. Since the product of all roots is 2. Also, each \\( S_i \\) is a sum of two products of roots. Maybe there's a way to relate \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) to the other symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if we denote \\( S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \\), and if we can compute \\( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \\), then we can relate it to the sum of the products. Let me compute \\( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \\):\n\nEach \\( S_i^2 \\) would be:\n\n\\( S_1^2 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)^2 = \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2^2 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2 \\)\n\nSimilarly for \\( S_2^2 \\) and \\( S_3^2 \\). Adding them up:\n\n\\( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = \\sum (\\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2 + 2\\alpha_i\\alpha_j\\alpha_k\\alpha_l + \\alpha_m^2\\alpha_n^2) \\)\n\nWait, this might get messy. Let me see if there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) are the roots of some cubic equation, and we can find that cubic equation using Vieta's. Since we know their sum is zero, and maybe their products can be related to the original polynomial's coefficients.\n\nWait, but how would that work? Let me think. Suppose that \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) are roots of a cubic equation \\( t^3 + pt^2 + qt + r = 0 \\). Then, using Vieta's formulas for this cubic, we would have:\n\n- \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -p \\)\n- \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = q \\)\n- \\( S_1S_2S_3 = -r \\)\n\nBut we already know that \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \\), so \\( p = 0 \\). Then the cubic would be \\( t^3 + qt + r = 0 \\).\n\nSo we need to find \\( q \\) and \\( r \\). Let's see if we can compute \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = q \\) and \\( S_1S_2S_3 = -r \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( q = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\).

Em centavos, qual é o custo de um lápis?", "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. So the problem is about figuring out the cost of one pencil. They give me two different combinations: three pencils and one jumbo eraser cost $1.24, and five pencils and one jumbo eraser cost $1.82. I need to find out how much one pencil costs, in cents. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably translate the problem into mathematical equations. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let's say the cost of one pencil is 'p' dollars, and the cost of one jumbo eraser is 'e' dollars. The problem mentions dollars and cents, and at the end they want the answer in cents, so maybe I'll need to convert dollars to cents later. But let's start with dollars first.\n\nAccording to the problem, three pencils and one eraser cost $1.24. So that translates to 3p + e = 1.24. Then, five pencils and one eraser cost $1.82, which is 5p + e = 1.82. So now I have two equations:\n\n1) 3p + e = 1.24\n\n2) 5p + e = 1.82\n\nSince both equations have the term 'e', maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'e'. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24.\n\nSimplifying the left side: 5p + e - 3p - e = 2p.\n\nRight side: 1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58.\n\nSo, 2p = 0.58. Therefore, p = 0.58 / 2 = 0.29.\n\nWait, so p is $0.29. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $1 is 100 cents, $0.29 is 29 cents. So, the cost of one pencil is 29 cents. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, defining variables: p for pencil, e for eraser. Equations set up correctly: 3p + e = 1.24 and 5p + e = 1.82. Subtracting equations: 2p = $0.58. Then p = $0.29, which is 29 cents. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify by plugging back into the original equations. If p is $0.29, then let's find e. Using the first equation: 3*(0.29) + e = 1.24. Calculating 3*0.29: 0.87. So 0.87 + e = 1.24. Therefore, e = 1.24 - 0.87 = 0.37. So the eraser is $0.37. Then check the second equation: 5*0.29 + 0.37. 5*0.29 is 1.45. Adding 0.37 gives 1.82, which matches the second equation. So that checks out. So yes, the pencil is 29 cents. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"Nenhum dos preços inclui impostos\" which I think just means that there are no taxes or additional costs included in those prices, so the prices are pure for the items themselves. So that's just a statement to clarify, not part of the equations. So my answer should be 29 cents. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure there isn't a trick here. Sometimes problems give you two equations and you have to solve for two variables, but in this case, since both equations have 'e', subtracting them allows us to eliminate 'e' and solve for 'p' directly. So yeah, that's the standard method for systems of equations. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to solve for 'e' as well, I could once I know 'p', substitute back into one of the equations. But since the question only asks for the cost of a pencil, once I found p = $0.29, which is 29 cents, that's the answer. So I think that's solid. \n\nJust to recap:\n\n1) 3p + e = 1.24\n\n2) 5p + e = 1.82\n\nSubtract 1 from 2:\n\n(5p - 3p) + (e - e) = 1.82 - 1.24\n\n2p = 0.58\n\np = 0.29 dollars = 29 cents.\n\nAll steps check out, and verifying the numbers in the original equations works. So I can confidently say the answer is 29 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cost of one pencil is \\boxed{29} cents.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the cost of one pencil in dollars and \\( e \\) be the cost of one jumbo eraser in dollars.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what this means. The fraction is 137 divided by 500. If I convert that into a decimal, it should be a terminating decimal because the denominator is a power of 2 or 5, right? Wait, 500 is 5^3 times 2^2, so yes, the decimal should terminate. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let me divide 137 by 500. Since 500 goes into 137 zero times, I can write it as 0. and then proceed with the division. Let's compute it step by step.\n\n137 divided by 500. Let me convert this fraction into a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to make the denominator 1000. So 137/500 = (137*2)/1000 = 274/1000. Therefore, 274 divided by 1000 is 0.274. So the decimal expansion is 0.274. So the digits to the right of the decimal are 2, 7, 4. The last non-zero digit is 4. Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do the long division of 137 divided by 500. Let's see:\n\n500 goes into 137 zero. Add a decimal point. Then add a zero: 1370 divided by 500. 500 goes into 1370 two times (500*2=1000). Subtract 1000 from 1370, get 370. Bring down another zero: 3700. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (500*7=3500). Subtract 3500 from 3700, get 200. Bring down a zero: 2000. 500 goes into 2000 four times (500*4=2000). Subtract, remainder zero. So the decimal is 0.274. So yes, the last non-zero digit is 4. But wait, the problem says \"the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal.\" So in 0.274, the digits after decimal are 2,7,4. So 4 is the last non-zero digit. So the answer is 4? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem is in Portuguese: \"Quanto é o último dígitodo n˜ao nula à direfeitáda do ponto decimal na_expansion decimal de 137/500?\" Translating that, it's \"What is the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 137/500?\" So according to my calculation, it's 4. But I have a feeling that maybe the problem is trickier. Maybe they want me to compute it without converting to decimal? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute the last non-zero digit directly without converting to decimal. Because sometimes, when the decimal is terminating, you can still have non-zero digits after a certain point, but in this case, the decimal terminates at three decimal places. So there are no more digits after 0.274. So 4 is the last non-zero digit. But maybe the problem is expecting me to consider something else. Let me check if 137/500 can be simplified. 137 is a prime number? Let me check: 137 divided by 2 is 68.5, not integer. Divided by 3: 137/3 ≈ 45.666, not integer. 5: ends with 7, so no. 7: 137/7 ≈ 19.57, nope. 11: 137/11 ≈12.45, no. 13: 137/13≈10.53, no. So 137 is prime. So 137 and 500 are co-prime. So the fraction is in simplest terms.\n\nTherefore, the decimal expansion is terminating at three digits. So 0.274. So the last non-zero digit is 4. So the answer is 4. But maybe the question is a trick question? Wait, maybe the problem is written in another way. Let me check the original problem again.\n\n\"Quanto é o último dígitodo n˜ao nula à direfação decimal de 137/500?\" So yes, \"non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point\". So in 0.274, the digits to the right are 2,7,4. So 4 is the last one. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is presented differently. Let me check the denominator: 500. 500 is 5^3 * 2^2. So when converting to decimal, the number of decimal places is determined by the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Here, exponent of 5 is 3, exponent of 2 is 2. So the number of decimal places is 3. So 137 divided by 500 is 0.274, which terminates after three decimal places. Therefore, the last digit is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another base? But no, it's decimal. So yeah, seems straightforward. But why would the problem be asked then? Maybe there is a mistake in my calculation. Let me verify 137 divided by 500.\n\n137 divided by 500. Let's compute 137/500. Since 1/500 is 0.002, so 137*0.002 = 0.274. Yes, that's correct. So 0.274. So the digits after decimal are 2,7,4. So the last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the last non-zero digit before multiplying by some power of 10? Wait, but since it's terminating, there are no digits beyond 4. So 4 is the last non-zero digit. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut I feel like maybe there's a different approach here. For example, sometimes in problems where you have to find the last non-zero digit of a fraction, even if it's terminating, you might need to adjust for the number of zeros introduced. But in this case, since the decimal terminates, there are no trailing zeros. So the last digit is already non-zero. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Let me check the numbers again. 137 divided by 500. 500 times 0.2 is 100, 500 times 0.3 is 150. So 0.274 times 500 is 137. So yes, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Maybe it's \"the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 137/500\", but 137/500 is 0.274, which is three decimal places. So digits are 2, 7, 4. So 4 is the last. So answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in a different way. For example, if the fraction was 137/50, which is 2.74, then the last non-zero digit is 4 as well. But in this case, denominator is 500. So 0.274. So answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute 137 divided by 500 by hand step by step to confirm.\n\nSo, 137 divided by 500. Let's do long division.\n\n500 ) 137.000\n\n500 goes into 1370 two times (2*500=1000). Subtract 1000 from 1370: 370.\n\nBring down the next 0: 3700.\n\n500 goes into 3700 seven times (7*500=3500). Subtract 3500 from 3700: 200.\n\nBring down the next 0: 2000.\n\n500 goes into 2000 four times (4*500=2000). Subtract: 0.\n\nSo the decimal is 0.274. So the last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4. But the problem seems straightforward. Maybe the original problem was in another form, but according to the given numbers, 137/500 converts to 0.274, so the last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a different base? But the problem mentions \"decimal expansion\", which implies base 10. So I think the answer is 4.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to compute the last non-zero digit. For example, sometimes, when dealing with fractions that result in trailing zeros in decimal, you can compute the last non-zero digit by multiplying by powers of 10 to eliminate the trailing zeros. But in this case, since the decimal terminates, there are no trailing zeros. So the last digit is already non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if 137/500 can be expressed in a different way. For example, 137 divided by 500. Let's see:\n\n137/500 = (137/5)/100. 137 divided by 5 is 27.4, so 27.4 divided by 100 is 0.274. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute 137 * 2^3 / 10^3, which is 137 * 8 / 1000 = 1096 / 1000 = 1.096, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, 137/500 = (137*2)/1000 = 274/1000 = 0.274. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \"137/500\" but with a different fraction. For example, if it were 137/50, which is 2.74, the last non-zero digit is 4. If it were 137/5, which is 27.4, last non-zero digit is 4. So seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the denominator was a multiple of 2 and 5 with higher exponents, but in this case, 500 is 2^2 * 5^3. So when converting to decimal, the number of decimal places is determined by the maximum exponent, which is 3 here. So 3 decimal places. So 0.274. So last digit is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another base, but since it's mentioned \"decimal expansion\", which is base 10. So I think the answer is 4. Therefore, I think the answer is 4. But just to be 100% sure, let me check with another method.\n\nAnother way: Let's compute 137 divided by 500. Since 500 is 5*100, so 137 divided by 500 is (137/5)/100. 137 divided by 5 is 27.4, so 27.4 divided by 100 is 0.274. So same result. So 0.274, last digit 4.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert 137/500 to a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to get denominator as 1000, which is 274/1000=0.274.\n\nTherefore, the last non-zero digit is 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check if there's a different interpretation. For example, sometimes problems ask for the last non-zero digit before the decimal, but that's not the case here. The problem says \"the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point\", which is exactly the last digit in the decimal part. So in 0.274, the digits are 2, 7, 4. The last one is 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a language where decimal point is represented differently? But the problem mentions \"a point decimal\", which is the same as a decimal point. So 0.274.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4. So I will go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}\n</think>\n\nTo find the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{137}{500}\\):\n\n1. Convert the fraction \\(\\frac{137}{500}\\) into a decimal. Since the denominator 500 is a product of powers of 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n2.

The ratio of AB to AD is given as k. Hmm, let me start by visualizing the rectangle. Let me sketch it mentally: ABCD with AB and CD as the top and bottom sides, and AD and BC as the left and right sides. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals. Since AB/AD = k, the rectangle is k times longer horizontally than vertically. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. So, if I want points closer to O than to any vertex, I need to consider the regions where the distance to O is less than the distance to A, B, C, or D. Since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe I can exploit that symmetry to simplify the problem.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the rectangle to make it easier. Let's place the center O at the origin (0,0). Since AB/AD = k, if I let AD = h (height), then AB = k*h (width). To make calculations easier, perhaps I can set specific coordinates. Let me choose coordinates such that point A is at (-k, h/2), B at (k, h/2), C at (k, -h/2), and D at (-k, -h/2). Wait, actually, if O is the center, then AB is the horizontal side and AD is the vertical side. So if AB = k * AD, then length AB = k * AD. Let me denote AD = a, so AB = k*a. Then, if I place the rectangle with O at (0,0), the coordinates would be A at (-k*a/2, a/2), B at (k*a/2, a/2), C at (k*a/2, -a/2), D at (-k*a/2, -a/2). Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set AD along the y-axis and AB along the x-axis, with the center at (0,0). Then, since AB = k * AD, if AD is of length h, AB is k*h. So, coordinates:\n\nLet me define the rectangle with A at (-k, 1), B at (k, 1), C at (k, -1), D at (-k, -1). Wait, but then AB would be 2k and AD would be 2, so the ratio AB/AD = k/1. But the problem states AB/AD = k, so if I set AD = 1, then AB = k. So, coordinates would be A at (-k/2, 1/2), B at (k/2, 1/2), C at (k/2, -1/2), D at (-k/2, -1/2). Hmm, maybe scaling the rectangle so that AD is 1 unit. Alternatively, perhaps to make calculations simpler, set coordinates such that AB = k and AD = 1. Then, since the rectangle is centered at the origin, the coordinates would be A at (-k/2, 1/2), B at (k/2, 1/2), C at (k/2, -1/2), D at (-k/2, -1/2). That might be a good approach.\n\nSo, the rectangle has vertices at (-k/2, 1/2), (k/2, 1/2), (k/2, -1/2), (-k/2, -1/2). The center O is at (0,0). The problem is to find the area of the region within the rectangle where a point (x,y) is closer to O than to any of the four vertices.\n\nTo formalize this, a point (x,y) is closer to O than to A, B, C, D if the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance from (x,y) to each of the vertices. So, we need to find the set of points (x,y) in the rectangle such that:\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nand\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nand\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nand\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nBut since the rectangle is symmetric with respect to both axes, and the center is at the origin, maybe we can consider the first quadrant where x >= 0 and y >= 0, and then multiply the area by 4 to get the total region. Wait, but the problem is about the entire rectangle. So, perhaps the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex will also be symmetric. So, maybe I can compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire region is symmetric across both axes and the origin, so we can compute the area in the first quadrant (x >=0, y >=0) and multiply by 4. Let me try that.\n\nSo, in the first quadrant, the vertices are A at (-k/2, 1/2), but since x >=0, maybe in the first quadrant, the vertex closest to O is A? Wait, no. Wait, the vertices are at (-k/2, 1/2), (k/2, 1/2), (k/2, -1/2), (-k/2, -1/2). So in the first quadrant, the vertices are at (k/2, 1/2) and (k/2, -1/2). Wait, but (k/2, 1/2) is vertex B, and (k/2, -1/2) is vertex C. Wait, no, hold on. If A is (-k/2, 1/2), B is (k/2, 1/2), C is (k/2, -1/2), D is (-k/2, -1/2). So in the first quadrant (x >=0, y >=0), the vertices are B at (k/2, 1/2) and C at (k/2, -1/2). Wait, but C is in the fourth quadrant. Wait, no. If the rectangle is centered at (0,0), then the four vertices are:\n\nA: (-k/2, 1/2) – second quadrant\n\nB: (k/2, 1/2) – first quadrant\n\nC: (k/2, -1/2) – fourth quadrant\n\nD: (-k/2, -1/2) – third quadrant\n\nSo, in the first quadrant, the vertex is B at (k/2, 1/2). Similarly, in the second quadrant, vertex A is (-k/2, 1/2), third quadrant vertex D is (-k/2, -1/2), and fourth quadrant vertex C is (k/2, -1/2). So, depending on the quadrant, the closest vertex varies. However, due to symmetry, maybe the regions where a point is closer to O than to any vertex will also be symmetric. Therefore, perhaps it's sufficient to compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by 4. Let me try this approach.\n\nSo, let's focus on the first quadrant where x >=0 and y >=0. The vertices in this quadrant are B at (k/2, 1/2). The other vertices in adjacent quadrants are A, C, D, but they are not in the first quadrant. So, in the first quadrant, the closest vertex to any point (x,y) would be either B or O? Wait, O is the center. Wait, but O is (0,0). So, the distance from (x,y) to O is sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and the distance to B is sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 ). So, in the first quadrant, the point (x,y) must satisfy sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 ) to be closer to O than to B. Similarly, in the fourth quadrant, the point would have to satisfy sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 ) to be closer to O than to C. But due to symmetry, these regions in first and fourth quadrants are mirror images. Similarly, in the second and third quadrants, the regions would be symmetric. So, perhaps the entire region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is symmetric across all four quadrants. Therefore, computing the area in the first quadrant and multiplying by 4 gives the total area.\n\nTherefore, let's focus on the first quadrant. The condition is that the distance to O is less than the distance to B. So, in the first quadrant, the region where sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 ). Let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\nx^2 + y^2 < (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(x^2 - k x + (k^2)/4) + (y^2 - y + 1/4)\n\nSo, x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - k x + (k^2)/4 + y^2 - y + 1/4\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting x^2 + y^2:\n\n0 < -k x + (k^2)/4 - y + 1/4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk x + y < (k^2)/4 + 1/4\n\nSo, the inequality is k x + y < (k^2 + 1)/4\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the region where a point is closer to O than to B is the area below the line k x + y = (k^2 + 1)/4.\n\nSimilarly, in the second quadrant, the condition would involve the distance to A, but due to symmetry, the region would be similar. Wait, actually, in the second quadrant, the closest vertex to a point (x,y) would be A at (-k/2, 1/2). So, the distance condition would be sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 ). Following similar steps, squaring both sides:\n\nx^2 + y^2 < (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nx^2 + k x + (k^2)/4 + y^2 - y + 1/4\n\nSubtracting x^2 + y^2:\n\n0 < k x + (k^2)/4 - y + 1/4\n\nWhich gives:\n\nk x - y < (k^2 + 1)/4\n\nSo, in the second quadrant, the region is above the line k x - y = (k^2 + 1)/4.\n\nSimilarly, in the third quadrant, the condition would involve vertex D, and in the fourth quadrant vertex C. But due to symmetry, these regions would mirror the first and second quadrant regions.\n\nTherefore, the total region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of all these regions in each quadrant. Wait, but actually, the condition must hold for all four vertices. So, in each quadrant, the point must be closer to O than to the nearby vertex in that quadrant. So, in the first quadrant, the condition is k x + y < (k^2 + 1)/4; in the second quadrant, k x - y < (k^2 + 1)/4; in the third quadrant, -k x - y < (k^2 + 1)/4; and in the fourth quadrant, -k x + y < (k^2 + 1)/4. But due to symmetry, these four inequalities define a diamond-shaped region centered at O. However, since we are in the rectangle, the intersection of these regions within the rectangle will form a polygon whose vertices are the intersections of these lines with the rectangle's sides or with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is bounded by these four lines. Let me try to visualize. The lines k x + y = (k^2 + 1)/4, k x - y = (k^2 + 1)/4, -k x - y = (k^2 + 1)/4, and -k x + y = (k^2 + 1)/4. These are four lines forming a diamond (a rotated rectangle) centered at O. The area bounded by these lines within the rectangle ABCD is the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the area of this diamond inside the rectangle and then dividing by the area of the rectangle to get the probability.\n\nSo, first, let me compute the area of the diamond. The diamond is defined by the four inequalities above. The intersection points of these lines can be found by solving the equations pairwise. For example, intersecting k x + y = (k^2 + 1)/4 and k x - y = (k^2 + 1)/4. Adding these two equations: 2 k x = (k^2 + 1)/2 => x = (k^2 + 1)/(4 k). Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2 y = 0 => y = 0. So, the intersection point is ( (k^2 +1)/(4k), 0 ). Similarly, intersecting k x + y = (k^2 +1)/4 and -k x + y = (k^2 +1)/4: Adding gives 2 y = (k^2 +1)/2 => y = (k^2 +1)/4. Subtracting gives 2 k x = 0 => x = 0. So, the intersection point is (0, (k^2 +1)/4 ). Wait, but this point may lie outside the rectangle. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the rectangle has vertices at (k/2, 1/2), so in the first quadrant, the maximum x is k/2 and maximum y is 1/2. So, (k^2 +1)/(4k) must be less than or equal to k/2 for the intersection point to lie within the rectangle. Let's check:\n\n(k^2 +1)/(4k) <= k/2\n\nMultiply both sides by ", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}
{"original_question": "Determine o resto de 54 (mod 6).", "question": "Determine o resto de 54 (mod 6).", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Hmm, let me start by recalling what modulo means. The expression \"54 mod 6\" is asking for the remainder after dividing 54 by 6. Right?\n\nAlright, division is basically splitting a number into equal parts. So if I divide 54 by 6, how many times does 6 go into 54? Let me do the division step by step. \n\nFirst, 6 times 1 is 6. Then 6 times 2 is 12, 6 times 3 is 18, 6 times 4 is 24, 6 times 5 is 30, 6 times 6 is 36, 6 times 7 is 42, 6 times 8 is 48, 6 times 9 is 54. Wait, hold on, 6 multiplied by 9 is exactly 54. So that means 6 divides into 54 exactly 9 times with no remainder left over. \n\nTherefore, if there's no remainder, the modulo operation would be 0. Let me confirm that. The formula for modulo is: a mod b = a - b * floor(a/b). So here, a is 54 and b is 6. The floor of 54 divided by 6 is 9, since 6*9=54. Then, 54 - 6*9 = 54 - 54 = 0. Yep, that checks out. \n\nSo the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. That makes sense because 54 is a multiple of 6. Let me think if there's another way to verify this. Maybe by listing the multiples of 6 and seeing which one equals 54. Starting from 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54... The ninth multiple is 54, so there's no leftover. \n\nAnother thought: since 6 times 9 is 54, 54 is divisible by 6, hence the remainder is zero. Yep, that's consistent. I don't think I made a mistake here. The key was recognizing that 6 multiplied by 9 gives exactly 54, so there's no remainder. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can check using subtraction. If I subtract 6 from 54 repeatedly until I can't subtract anymore, the remaining number is the remainder. Let's try: 54 - 6 = 48, 48 -6=42, 42-6=36, 36-6=30, 30-6=24, 24-6=18, 18-6=12, 12-6=6, 6-6=0. I subtracted 6 a total of 9 times, and I ended up with 0. So that confirms that the remainder is indeed 0. \n\nSo all methods point to the same conclusion: 54 divided by 6 is 9 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 54 mod 6 is 0. I think that's solid. No issues here. The answer should be 0.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the remainder of \\(54 \\mod 6\\):\n\n1. **Division**: Divide 54 by 6.  \n   \\(54 \\div 6 = 9\\) with a remainder.  \n   Since \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\), there is no remainder.\n\n2. **Verification**:  \n   - Using the formula \\(a \\mod b = a - b \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor\\):  \n     \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{54}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 9\\)  \n     \\(54 - 6 \\times 9 = 54 - 54 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Multiples Check**:  \n   The ninth multiple of 6 is \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\), confirming no remainder.\n\n4. **Subtraction Method**:  \n   Subtracting 6 from 54 nine times results in 0.\n\nThus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", "answer": "0"}

So, for each term in the sum, I need to first evaluate whether the input is greater than or equal to 4 or not, and then apply the corresponding function (floor or ceiling) to get the result. Then, after computing each term individually, I can add them all together to get the final answer.\n\nLet me break down each term one by one.\n\nFirst term: f(π/3). So, π is approximately 3.14159, right? So π divided by 3 is approximately 3.14159 / 3 ≈ 1.0471975. So π/3 ≈ 1.0472. Now, since this value is less than 4, according to the definition of f(n), we need to apply the ceiling function here. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. So, the ceiling of 1.0472 would be 2, because 2 is the smallest integer that is greater than 1.0472. Therefore, f(π/3) = 2.\n\nSecond term: f(√45). Let's compute √45. 45 is between 36 and 49, so the square root should be between 6 and 7. Let's calculate it more precisely. 6^2 = 36, 6.5^2 = 42.25, 6.7^2 = 44.89, which is very close to 45. So √45 ≈ 6.7082. So, √45 ≈ 6.7082. Now, since this is greater than 4, we use the floor function. The floor of 6.7082 is 6, because 6 is the greatest integer less than or equal to 6.7082. Therefore, f(√45) = 6.\n\nThird term: f(8^(2/3)). Let's compute 8^(2/3). 8 is 2^3, so 8^(2/3) is (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2^2 = 4. So, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4. Now, since the input here is exactly 4, which is equal to 4, we use the floor function as per the definition. The floor of 4 is 4. Therefore, f(8^(2/3)) = 4.\n\nNow, adding up all three terms: 2 + 6 + 4. Let me compute that: 2 + 6 is 8, and 8 + 4 is 12. So the total sum is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst term: π/3. π is approximately 3.1416, so divided by 3 is indeed approximately 1.047. Since 1.047 is less than 4, ceiling is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(45). Let's verify sqrt(45). 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49. 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is 0.11 less than 45. So sqrt(45) is approximately 6.708. So, 6.708 is indeed greater than 4, so floor is 6. Correct.\n\nThird term: 8^(2/3). 8 is 2^3, so 8^(2/3) is (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2^2 = 4. So, exactly 4. Since 4 is the threshold, floor(4) is 4. Correct.\n\nThen adding 2 + 6 + 4: 2 + 6 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12. So, the answer should be 12.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward, but let me check if I interpreted the function correctly. The function f(n) is floor(n) if n ≥ 4, else ceiling(n). So for numbers less than 4, it's ceiling, and for numbers 4 and above, it's floor. Wait, hold on. Wait, the floor function usually takes a number and gives the greatest integer less than or equal to it, right? And ceiling gives the least integer greater than or equal. So for example, floor(1.047) is 1, but ceiling(1.047) is 2. So that's correct. So for numbers less than 4, we take ceiling, which rounds up to the next integer. For numbers 4 or more, take floor, which is the integer part (since they're already integers if the number is integer). Wait, but in the third term, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4, so floor(4) is 4, which is correct. If it was, say, 4.5, floor(4.5) would be 4. But since 4.5 is equal to 4.5, floor is 4. But if it's 4.999, floor is still 4. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the first term, π/3. π is approximately 3.1415926535, so dividing by 3 gives approximately 1.0471975512. So, yes, that's correct. Since that's less than 4, ceiling is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond term, sqrt(45). Let me compute sqrt(45) more precisely. 6.7^2 = 44.89, 6.71^2 = 45.0241, so sqrt(45) is approximately 6.7082039325. So that's approximately 6.7082, which is less than 7, so floor would be 6. Correct.\n\nThird term, 8^(2/3). As we saw, 8^(1/3) is 2, so 2 squared is 4. So exactly 4. So floor(4) is 4. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all three terms are computed correctly, and their sum is 12. So, the answer is 12. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \\) where the function \\( f(n) \\) is defined as:\n\\[\nf(n) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\lfloor n \\rfloor & \\text{if } n \\geq 4, \\\\\n\\lceil n \\rceil & \\text{if } n < 4,\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\n1. **Evaluating \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\)**:\n   - \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\approx 1.0472 \\), which is less than 4.\n   - Therefore, we use the ceiling function: \\( \\lceil 1.0472 \\rceil = 2 \\).\n   - Hence, \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Evaluating \\( f(\\sqrt{45}) \\)**:\n   - \\( \\sqrt{45} \\approx 6.7082 \\), which is greater than 4.\n   - Therefore, we use the floor function: \\( \\lfloor 6.7082 \\rfloor = 6 \\).\n   - Hence, \\( f(\\sqrt{45}) = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating \\( f(8^{2/3}) \\)**:\n   - \\( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \\), which is exactly 4.\n   - Therefore, we use the floor function: \\( \\lfloor 4 \\rfloor = 4 \\).\n   - Hence, \\( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \\).\n\nAdding these results together:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).", "answer": "12"}

Quanto dinheiro, em centavos, restou após converterem o máximo de moedas em notas que puderam?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie sold biscuits and made different amounts of money. Linda made $27.47, Sherry $35.23, June $37.37, and Connie $26.52. Then they all added up their money and went to the bank to convert the coins into bills. The question is, how much money, in centavos, was left after converting as many coins as possible into bills. So, essentially, we need to find the total amount they have in cents, then subtract the largest number of dollar bills they can get, and the remainder will be the leftover cents.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each person has a certain amount of money with dollars and cents. When they combine all their money, the total will be some number of dollars and cents. Then, when they go to convert the coins into bills, they can only use whole dollar bills. So, the leftover money would be the amount that can't make up a full dollar, right? So, for example, if the total is $100.50, converting as many bills as possible would mean getting 100 one-dollar bills, leaving 50 cents. So the question is asking for that leftover cents, specifically in centavos, which are hundredths of a dollar, so cents.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money they have together in cents.\n2. Divide that total by 100 to get the number of dollars, and the remainder will be the leftover cents.\n3. The answer is the remainder in cents, which should be between 0 and 99.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"restou como centavos\" which translates to \"remained in centavos\". So, the leftover is in cents, so we just need to find the remainder when the total is divided by 100, and that's the answer in cents. So, for example, if the total was 12345 cents, dividing by 100 gives 123 dollars and 45 cents, so the remainder is 45 centavos. Therefore, the answer would be 45.\n\nBut let me double-check the steps. First, convert each person's amount to cents. Then sum all those cents, then take the total modulo 100 to get the remainder in cents. That should give the answer.\n\nLet me do the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, convert each person's amount to cents. Since dollars to cents is multiplying by 100, and cents stay the same.\n\nLinda: $27.47 = 27*100 + 47 = 2747 cents\n\nSherry: $35.23 = 35*100 + 23 = 3523 cents\n\nJune: $37.37 = 37*100 + 37 = 3737 cents\n\nConnie: $26.52 = 26*100 + 52 = 2652 cents\n\nNow, add all these up:\n\n2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652\n\nLet me compute step by step.\n\nFirst, add Linda and Sherry: 2747 + 3523\n\n2747 + 3523:\n\n2700 + 3500 = 6200\n\n47 + 23 = 70\n\nSo total is 6200 + 70 = 6270 cents.\n\nNext, add June's amount: 6270 + 3737\n\n6270 + 3737:\n\n6000 + 3000 = 9000\n\n270 + 737 = 1007\n\nSo 9000 + 1007 = 10007 cents.\n\nThen, add Connie's amount: 10007 + 2652\n\n10007 + 2652:\n\n10000 + 2000 = 12000\n\n7 + 652 = 659\n\n12000 + 659 = 12659 cents.\n\nSo total is 12659 cents.\n\nNow, to find the remainder when divided by 100, since each dollar is 100 cents. So 12659 divided by 100 is 126 dollars with a remainder of 59 cents. Therefore, the leftover is 59 centavos.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again to make sure.\n\n27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52.\n\nAlternatively, adding the dollars first:\n\n27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 27+35=62; 62+37=99; 99+26=125 dollars.\n\nThen adding the cents: 47 + 23 + 37 + 52.\n\n47+23=70; 70+37=107; 107+52=159 cents.\n\nSo total is 125 dollars and 159 cents, which is 126.59 dollars. So 126 dollars and 59 cents. So converting to cents, that's 126*100 + 59 = 12600 + 59 = 12659 cents. Then 12659 divided by 100 is 126.59, so 126 dollars, 59 cents. Therefore, the remainder is 59 cents. So the answer is 59 centavos.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"oito\" which is 8? Wait, no, the problem is in Portuguese. Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Quanto ingresso, em centavos, restou após convertér o máximo de moedas em cada uma das kartas?\" which translates to \"How much money, in centavos, remained after converting the maximum number of coins in each of the cards?\" Wait, maybe the translation is slightly off. Wait, but the key part is converting the coins into bills. So the total amount is converted into as many dollar bills as possible, and the remainder is the leftover in cents. So yes, the remainder when total is divided by 100 is the amount left in cents, which is the answer.\n\nSo according to the calculation, 12659 cents divided by 100 is 126.59, so 126 dollars and 59 cents. Therefore, the remainder is 59 cents, so 59 centavos. So the answer is 59.\n\nBut let me verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is presented differently. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"After the sale, they pooled their money and went to the bank to exchange the coins into bills. How much money, in centavos, was left after exchanging the maximum number of coins into bills?\"\n\nSo \"exchange the maximum number of coins into bills\" – which means that they are exchanging all their coins (the cents part) into as many dollar bills as possible, and the remainder is the leftover cents. So yes, the leftover is the amount that couldn't make up a full dollar, so that's the remainder when total cents is divided by 100.\n\nTherefore, 12659 divided by 100: 12659 ÷ 100 = 126.59. So the remainder is 59. Therefore, 59 centavos. So the answer is 59.\n\nBut let me check the arithmetic once again to be thorough.\n\nFirst, converting each amount to cents:\n\nLinda: $27.47 = 27*100 + 47 = 2747\n\nSherry: $35.23 = 35*100 +23=3523\n\nJune: $37.37=37*100+37=3737\n\nConnie: $26.52=26*100+52=2652\n\nSum:\n\n2747 + 3523 = 2747 + 3500 = 6247; 6247 +23=6270\n\n6270 +3737: 6270 + 3000 = 9270; 9270 + 737 = 10007\n\n10007 +2652: 10007 + 2000=12007; 12007 +652=12659. Correct.\n\nTotal cents:12659.\n\n12659 divided by 100 is 126.59. So 126 dollars, 59 cents. Therefore, 59 centavos left. So answer is 59.\n\nBut let me check if there is any possible mistake here. For example, maybe the problem is expecting something else.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in Portuguese, and \"centavos\" is a term for cents. So yes, the answer is in cents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using \"centavos\" as a unit, which is the same as cents. So 100 centavos = 1 real (the Brazilian currency before the Real symbol was used). So yes, \"centavos\" is 1/100 of a Real, same as cents in US. So converting all their money into Reais and cents, then the remainder in cents would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in a way that each of them has some coins, but the problem states they \"vendли biscuits de escoteira\" and arrecadou money. So perhaps each person has coins (like pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters) and they are pooling their coins together and converting them into bills. So the total amount they have in coins is the sum of all their coins, and then converting as many as possible into dollar bills, leaving the remainder in coins. But the problem says \"oito\" which is 8? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the original problem might have had \"oito\" but the translation is \"how much... in centavos\". Maybe \"oito\" is a typo or mistranslation. But given the context, the answer is 59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in a different way. Wait, the problem says \"oito\" but perhaps in the original Portuguese, it's \"oito\" but here it's translated as \"how much... in centavos\". Maybe the problem is asking for something else. Wait, no. The key is that after converting all their money into bills (i.e., exchanging the coins into dollar bills), how much is left. So the leftover is the amount that can't be made into a dollar, which is the remainder in cents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 59 centavos. So I think that is correct.\n\nBut let me check once more with the total.\n\nTotal dollars: 27 +35 +37 +26 = 125 dollars.\n\nTotal cents: 47 +23 +37 +52 = 159 cents.\n\nSo total money is 125 dollars and 159 cents, which is 126.59 dollars.\n\n126.59 dollars is equal to 12659 cents.\n\nDivided by 100, that's 126 dollars, 59 cents. So remainder is 59 cents. So 59 centavos.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{59}\n</think>\n\nLinda, Sherry, June, and Connie sold biscuits and made the following amounts of money: Linda ($\\$27.47$), Sherry ($\\$35.23$), June ($\\$37.37$), and Connie ($\\$26.52$).

I need to find the average score of the class. There are 30 students in total. Out of them, 20 got 80, 8 got 90, and 2 got 100. Hmm, average is usually the total sum divided by the number of people, right? So first, I should calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by 30.\n\nLet me break it down. The 20 students who scored 80: so that's 20 multiplied by 80. Let me compute that. 20 times 80 is 1600. Got that. Then the 8 students with 90: 8 times 90. Let's see, 8 times 90 is 720. And the 2 students who got 100: 2 times 100 is 200. Now, add all those up to get the total sum.\n\nSo adding 1600, 720, and 200. Let's do 1600 plus 720 first. 1600 + 700 is 2300, and then plus 20 more is 2320. Then add the 200. 2320 + 200 is 2520. So the total sum of all the scores is 2520.\n\nNow, to find the average, I divide this total by the number of students, which is 30. So 2520 divided by 30. Hmm, let me compute that. 30 times 80 is 2400. Subtract 2400 from 2520, which leaves 120. Then 120 divided by 30 is 4. So 80 plus 4 is 84. Wait, so 2520 divided by 30 is 84. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down the division. 2520 divided by 30. Since 30 is 3 times 10, I can divide by 10 first and then by 3. Dividing 2520 by 10 gives 252, then dividing 252 by 3. 3 goes into 25 eight times (24) with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 2, making it 12. 3 goes into 12 four times. So 84. Yep, that's correct. So the average is 84.\n\nLet me just verify once more to be sure. 20 students at 80: 20*80=1600. 8 students at 90: 8*90=720. 2 students at 100: 2*100=200. Total is 1600+720=2320+200=2520. Total students 30. 2520/30=84. Yep, that's correct.

I need to find the value of n in this magic square. From what I remember, a magic square has all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals adding up to the same number. So, my goal is to set up equations based on that property and solve for n.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the square based on the Asymptote code. The square is divided into a 3x3 grid. The labels are given in the Asymptote code, so I can map them out:\n\nTop row (from left to right):\n- First cell: n - 3\n- Second cell: 3\n- Third cell: n + 1\n\nMiddle row (from left to right):\n- First cell: n + 2\n- Second cell: 2n - 9\n- Third cell: 1\n\nBottom row (from left to right):\n- First cell: 2\n- Second cell: n\n- Third cell: n - 1\n\nSo the square looks like this:\n\n| n-3 | 3    | n+1 |\n|-----|------|-----|\n| n+2 | 2n-9 | 1   |\n| 2   | n    | n-1 |\n\nAlright, now I need to set up equations based on the magic square properties. Let's start with the first row. The sum of the first row should be equal to the magic constant, let's call it S. So:\n\n(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S\n\nSimplify that:\n\nn - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S\n\nSo, 2n + 1 is the magic constant.\n\nNow, let's look at the second row. The sum should also be S:\n\n(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S\n\nSimplify:\n\nn + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S\n\nSo, 3n - 6 is also equal to S. Since both expressions equal S, they must be equal to each other:\n\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\nSolving for n:\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides: 1 = n - 6\n\nAdd 6 to both sides: n = 7\n\nWait, so n is 7? Let me check if this works for other rows and diagonals to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet's compute the magic constant S using n = 7.\n\nFrom the first row: 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15\n\nFrom the second row: 3n - 6 = 3*7 - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15\n\nOkay, so S is 15. Let's check the third row:\n\n2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. That works.\n\nNow, check the columns. Let's start with the first column:\n\n(n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Good.\n\nSecond column:\n\n3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Perfect.\n\nThird column:\n\n(n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = (7 + 1) + 1 + 6 = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15. Nice.\n\nNow, the diagonals. First diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):\n\n(n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. That's correct.\n\nSecond diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):\n\n(n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15. Also correct.\n\nSo, all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 15 when n = 7. Therefore, the value of n is 7.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just double-check my equations to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes when solving for n. The first row gave S = 2n + 1, the second row gave S = 3n - 6. Setting them equal: 2n +1 = 3n -6 → n =7. Yep, that's correct. The rest of the checks worked out. So, I'm confident that n =7 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( n \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and the two main diagonals are equal, we need to find the value of \\( n \\).\n\nThe magic square is structured as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nn-3 & 3 & n+1 \\\\\n\\hline\nn+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & n & n-1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the first row:\n\\[\n(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the second row:\n\\[\n(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6\n\\]\n\nSince both sums must be equal (they are both the magic constant \\( S \\)):\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\\\\n1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \\\\\nn = 7\n\\]\n\nWe verify the magic constant \\( S \\) using \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 2 \\times 7 + 1 = 15 \\\\\n3n - 6 = 3 \\times 7 - 6 = 15\n\\]\n\nChecking the third row:\n\\[\n2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15\n\\]\n\nChecking the columns:\n- First column: \\((7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15\\)\n- Second column: \\(3 + (2 \\times 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\\)\n- Third column: \\((7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15\\)\n\nChecking the diagonals:\n- First diagonal: \\((7 - 3) + (2 \\times 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\\)\n- Second diagonal: \\((7 + 1) + (2 \\times 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15\\)\n\nAll rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, confirming the value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).", "answer": "7"}

Jim caminha diagonalmente pelo campo. Martha chega ao mesmo local caminhando ao longo de seu comprimento e largura. O campo tem 300 pés de largura e 400 pés de comprimento. Quantos pés a menos que Martha Jim caminha?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So, the problem is about Jim and Martha starting at the same corner of a rectangular field. Jim is taking the diagonal path, while Martha is going along the length and the width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. We need to find out how many feet less Jim walks compared to Martha.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out the distance each of them covers. For Martha, it's straightforward. She walks the entire length and then the entire width. So, that would be 400 feet plus 300 feet. Let me calculate that: 400 + 300 = 700 feet. So Martha walks 700 feet in total.\n\nNow, Jim is taking the diagonal. To find the length of the diagonal in a rectangle, I remember from geometry that you can use the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of a right-angled triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. In this case, the length and width of the field are the legs, so a = 400 feet and b = 300 feet. So, the diagonal would be the square root of (400² + 300²).\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, square 400: 400 * 400 = 160,000. Then square 300: 300 * 300 = 90,000. Add those two results together: 160,000 + 90,000 = 250,000. Then take the square root of 250,000. Hmm, what's the square root of 250,000?\n\nWell, 500 squared is 250,000 because 500*500=250,000. Wait, but 500 squared is 250,000? Let me check: 500*500. 5*5=25, and then two zeros from each 500, so 25 followed by four zeros: 250,000. Yes, that's right. So the square root of 250,000 is 500. Therefore, the diagonal is 500 feet.\n\nSo Jim walks 500 feet, and Martha walks 700 feet. The question is asking how many feet less does Jim walk than Martha. So subtract Jim's distance from Martha's distance: 700 - 500 = 200 feet.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, verifying the Pythagorean theorem part: 400² is 160,000, 300² is 90,000. Adding them gives 250,000. Square root of 250,000 is indeed 500 because 500*500 is 250,000. Then Martha's total is 400 + 300 = 700. So 700 - 500 = 200. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to check. If the field were a square, then the diagonal would be side*sqrt(2). But in this case, it's a rectangle, so the formula still applies. Let me think if there's any possible error here.\n\nWait, could I have confused the length and width? The problem says the field has 300 pés of largura and 400 pés of comprimento. So width is 300, length is 400. So the sides are 300 and 400. So the diagonal is sqrt(300² + 400²). Which is sqrt(90,000 + 160,000) = sqrt(250,000) = 500. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that the diagonal is just the sum, but that would be 700, which is the same as Martha's path. But no, that's not right. The diagonal is a straight line, so it's shorter than going along both sides. Which in this case, 500 is indeed shorter than 700. So the difference is 200 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 200 feet. Let me just verify once more. 500 + 500 is 1000, which is more than 700. Wait, no, that's not necessary. But the calculation seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, if I calculate the difference in steps: Martha walks 400 + 300 = 700. Jim walks sqrt(400² + 300²) = 500. So 700 - 500 = 200. Yep, that's 200 feet less. So the answer is 200.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations. The key was recognizing that the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 300 and 400. Applying Pythagoras gives 500, subtracting from 700 gives 200. So the answer is 200 feet.\n</think>\n\nJim e Martha start no cantinho de um campo retangular. Jim caminha diagonalmente,enquanto Martha irá ao longo da comprão e da largura.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that the cube roots of 1 are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. Also, these roots satisfy the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Maybe that equation will be useful here.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the roots. Since ω³ = 1, the roots are 1, ω, ω². But since ω ≠ 1, we can use the fact that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression we need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me see if I can simplify this. Maybe combine the two fractions into a single fraction? Let's try that.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So:\n\n[1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)] / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n(1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAnd the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand that:\n\n1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so substituting that in:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nSo both the numerator and the denominator become 2 + ω + ω². Wait, that means the expression simplifies to (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1. So does that mean the expression is always equal to 1? But the problem says \"Encontre todos os valores possíveis\", implying there might be more than one value. But according to this, it's always 1. Is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nStarting with 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since ω³ = 1, maybe there's another way to approach this. Since ω is a root of x³ - 1 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. So ω and ω² satisfy x² + x + 1 = 0. Therefore, ω² = -ω -1, and similarly ω = -ω² -1.\n\nSo maybe substitute ω² = -ω -1 into the expression. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Substitute ω² with -ω -1:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-ω -1)) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(-ω)\n\nSimplify the second term: 1/(-ω) = -1/ω. So the expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.\n\nNow, let's combine these terms. The common denominator would be ω(1 + ω). So:\n\n[ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)] = [ω -1 - ω] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1)/[ω(1 + ω)]\n\nHmm, so now we have -1/[ω(1 + ω)]. Let me compute ω(1 + ω):\n\nω + ω². But since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then ω + ω² = -1. So ω(1 + ω) = -1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is -1, so the entire expression becomes -1/(-1) = 1. So again, we get 1.\n\nWait, so no matter how I approach it, substituting or combining fractions, I end up with 1. So does that mean the expression is always equal to 1? But the problem says \"Encontre todos os valores possíveis\", which implies there could be multiple values. Maybe the problem is designed such that even though ω can be ω or ω², the expression still evaluates to the same value in both cases?\n\nWait, let's check with specific values. Let me take ω = e^(2πi/3) which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then ω = -1/2 + i√3/2 and ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal is 2/(1 + i√3). Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2. The reciprocal is 2/(1 - i√3).\n\nSo adding these two reciprocals:\n\n2/(1 + i√3) + 2/(1 - i√3). Let's compute each term:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate to rationalize:\n\n2/(1 + i√3) * (1 - i√3)/(1 - i√3) = 2(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nSimilarly, 2/(1 - i√3) * (1 + i√3)/(1 + i√3) = 2(1 + i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2\n\nAdding these two results: (1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo indeed, the sum is 1. Therefore, regardless of whether ω is ω or ω², the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, let's check the case when ω = 1. Wait, but ω ≠ 1 because it's given that ω³ = 1 and ω is a complex number. So ω is either ω or ω². In both cases, the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Encontre todos os valores possíveis\", so maybe 1 is the only possible value. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another approach. Let me consider that ω³ = 1, so ω³ - 1 = 0, which factors as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Since ω ≠ 1, then ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So we can use this equation.\n\nLet me denote S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's compute S.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 + ω²) and (1 + ω) respectively. Wait, but maybe a better approach is to express S as follows:\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)] = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nWait, that's the same as before. The numerator is 2 + ω + ω², denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Then since ω² + ω + 1 = 0, numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1. Denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's compute the denominator:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so substituting:\n\n1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². Again, since ω + ω² = -1, denominator is 2 -1 = 1. Therefore, S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of ω being ω or ω², S is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's use the fact that ω² = conjugate of ω if we consider ω as a complex root. Since ω = e^(2πi/3), its conjugate is e^(-2πi/3) = ω². So maybe the expression is real. Let me compute numerically.\n\nTake ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal is 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2/(1 + i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3): 2(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = (1 - i√3)/2. Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) would be the conjugate, which is (1 + i√3)/2. Adding them gives (1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3)/2 = 1. So indeed, the sum is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we take ω = e^(-2πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2, then 1 + ω = 1/2 - i√3/2, reciprocal is (1 + i√3)/2, and 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2, reciprocal is (1 - i√3)/2. Adding them gives the same result: 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which complex cube root of unity we take (other than 1), the expression evaluates to 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Encontre todos os valores possíveis\", which is Portuguese for \"Find all possible values\". If the expression always equals 1, then the only possible value is 1. So the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other case. For example, if ω is allowed to be 1, but the problem states ω is a complex number with ω³=1. Since 1 is real, but ω and ω² are complex. So ω must be one of the non-real cube roots. Therefore, the expression is always 1, so only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity, satisfying the equation \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\). This implies \\(\\omega^2 = -\\omega - 1\\) and \\(\\omega = -\\omega^2 - 1\\).\n\nWe start by combining the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\), we substitute \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\):\n\\[\n2 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the denominator by expanding \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\):\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we substitute this in:\n\\[\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nAgain, using \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\):\n\\[\n2 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe verified this result by substituting specific values of \\(\\omega\\) (both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\)) and rationalizing the denominators, which confirmed the result.

Hmm, this sounds like a traveling salesman problem (TSP) but with the added twist that we can start at any of the four points. The TSP is about finding the shortest possible route that visits each city (or in this case, point) exactly once and returns to the starting point. But here, the problem says \"visit the other three points once,\" which I think means that we don't have to return to the starting point. So it's more like a traveling salesman path problem, where you start at a point, visit all others exactly once, and the total distance is minimized. And we can choose which starting point to minimize over.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out all possible routes starting from each of the four points and calculate their total distances. Then, compare them to find the smallest one.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should sketch the diagram based on the Asymptote code provided. The Asymptote code draws lines between D--B--C--cycle, D--A--B--cycle, and D--A--C--cycle. The labels are given for the distances: DB is 3, AB is 6, AC is 6, DC is 4, AD is 5, CB is 4. Let me note down all the distances:\n\nFrom the Asymptote code:\n\n- D to B: 3\n- D to A: 5\n- A to B: 6\n- A to C: 6\n- C to B: 4\n- D to C: 4\n\nAlso, since the figure is drawn with these connections, the points are arranged such that D is connected to A, B, and C. Let me try to visualize this. Let me note the coordinates given in the Asymptote code:\n\nA = (-3,3)\nB = (3,0)\nC = (0,-4)\nD = (0,0)\n\nSo, D is at the origin. A is at (-3,3), which is in the second quadrant. B is at (3,0), so on the x-axis. C is at (0,-4), on the negative y-axis. So connecting D to B is 3 units, D to A is 5 units, A to B is 6 units, A to C is 6 units, C to B is 4 units, and D to C is 4 units.\n\nLet me verify the distances using coordinates to ensure that the given distances are correct. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check.\n\nFirst, distance from D(0,0) to B(3,0): that's 3 units, which matches. Distance from D(0,0) to A(-3,3): sqrt[(-3-0)^2 + (3-0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = sqrt[18] ≈ 4.24, but the problem states DA is 5. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait, maybe the coordinates are approximate? Because in the Asymptote code, it's possible that the points are placed to make the distances look certain, but the actual coordinates might not exactly match. Let me check the distances again.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code draws D--B--C--cycle, D--A--B--cycle, and D--A--C--cycle. So the figure is a combination of those three polygons. Let's see:\n\n1. D--B--C--cycle: So triangle DBC with sides DB=3, BC=4, and CD=4.\n\n2. D--A--B--cycle: Triangle DAB with sides DA=5, AB=?, and BD=3.\n\n3. D--A--C--cycle: Triangle DAC with sides DA=5, AC=6, and CD=4.\n\nBut then, the distance AB is given as 6. Let's compute AB with coordinates A(-3,3) and B(3,0):\n\nDifference in x: 3 - (-3) = 6, difference in y: 0 - 3 = -3. So AB distance is sqrt(6² + (-3)²) = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708, but the problem states AB is 6. Hmm, so there is inconsistency here. Maybe the coordinates are not to scale? The Asymptote code might have just placed the points approximately, but the distances given are exact. So perhaps we should take the given distances as exact, even if the coordinates don't perfectly reflect them. The problem is presented with exact distances, so we should use those.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates might be illustrative but not exact. So, perhaps I shouldn't rely on the coordinates but just take the given distances as accurate. Let me list the distances again:\n\n- DB = 3\n- DA = 5\n- AB = 6\n- AC = 6\n- CB = 4\n- DC = 4\n\nAdditionally, since DA=5, AC=6, and DC=4, there is triangle DAC with sides 5, 6, 4. Let me check if that's possible. 5 + 4 > 6: 9 > 6, yes. 5 + 6 > 4: 11 > 4, yes. 4 + 6 > 5: 10 > 5, yes. So triangle DAC is valid.\n\nSimilarly, triangle DBC has sides DB=3, BC=4, DC=4. Check: 3 + 4 > 4: 7 > 4, yes. 3 + 4 > 4: same. 4 + 4 > 3: 8 > 3, yes. So triangle DBC is valid.\n\nTriangles DAB and ABC: AB is given as 6, DA=5, so triangle DAB has sides 5, 6, 3? Wait, DB=3. So triangle DAB has sides DA=5, DB=3, AB=6. Check the triangle inequality: 5 + 3 > 6? 8 > 6, yes. 5 + 6 > 3: 11 > 3. 3 + 6 > 5: 9 > 5. So triangle DAB is valid.\n\nSo all given distances are consistent with triangle inequalities.\n\nNow, the problem is to start at any of the four points (A, B, C, D) and visit the other three exactly once, then find the minimal total distance.\n\nSince we can start at any point, we need to compute the minimal route for each starting point and then take the smallest of those four totals.\n\nSo, for each starting point, we need to find all possible Hamiltonian paths (visiting each of the other three points exactly once) and compute their total distances, then pick the shortest one for each start point, then compare all four.\n\nBut with four points, starting at each point, the number of paths is 3! = 6 for each starting point. But since the path is a route, the direction matters. So for each starting point, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the other three points. However, since some paths might repeat due to direction, but in terms of total distance, it's the same regardless of direction.\n\nWait, but since we are starting at a point and visiting the others in some order, the direction of the path (clockwise or counterclockwise) would affect the sequence of the points but not the total distance. So for each starting point, the number of unique paths is 3! = 6. So for each starting point, there are 6 different routes. Therefore, to compute the minimal distance for each starting point, we need to check all 6 permutations.\n\nBut 4 starting points times 6 permutations each would be 24 total routes. However, some of these routes might be duplicates in terms of total distance. For example, starting at A and going B->C->D is the same as starting at A and going D->C->B in terms of the set of distances, but the order is different. However, the total distance would be the same: AB + AC + AD or something else. Wait, no. Wait, the total distance depends on the order of the path. For example, starting at A, going to B, then to C, then to D would have a total distance of AB + BC + CD. But starting at A, going to D, then to C, then to B would be AD + DC + CB. These are different paths, but the total distances would be AB + BC + CD vs. AD + DC + CB. However, BC and CB are the same distance, so BC = 4 and CB = 4. Similarly, DC is 4, so DC and CD are both 4. But AD is 5, and AB is 6. So the total distances would be:\n\nFirst route: AB + BC + CD = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14\n\nSecond route: AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 4 = 13\n\nWait, so different starting points can lead to different total distances even for the same set of edges. Therefore, the starting point does affect the total distance. Therefore, we need to consider all possible starting points and all possible permutations of the other three points, compute the total distance for each, and then find the minimum.\n\nBut with 4 starting points and 6 permutations each, that's 24 routes. However, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all 24.\n\nAlternatively, for each starting point, we can list all possible routes and compute their distances. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible permutations for each starting point. Let me start with point A.\n\nStarting at A:\n\nWe need to visit B, C, D. The possible permutations of B, C, D are:\n\n1. B -> C -> D\n2. B -> D -> C\n3. C -> B -> D\n4. C -> D -> B\n5. D -> B -> C\n6. D -> C -> B\n\nFor each of these, compute the total distance:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D: AB + BC + CD = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14\n2. A -> B -> D -> C: AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\n3. A -> C -> B -> D: AC + CB + BD = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\n4. A -> C -> D -> B: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\n5. A -> D -> B -> C: AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12\n6. A -> D -> C -> B: AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 4 = 13\n\nSo the total distances starting at A are 14, 13, 13, 13, 12, 13. The minimal is 12.\n\nWait, route 5: A -> D -> B -> C has total distance 5 + 3 + 4 = 12. That's the shortest starting at A.\n\nNext, starting at B:\n\nWe need to visit A, C, D. Permutations of A, C, D:\n\n1. A -> C -> D\n2. A -> D -> C\n3. C -> A -> D\n4. C -> D -> A\n5. D -> A -> C\n6. D -> C -> A\n\nCompute total distances:\n\n1. B -> A -> C -> D: BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\n2. B -> A -> D -> C: BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\n3. B -> C -> A -> D: BC + CA + AD = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n4. B -> C -> D -> A: BC + CD + DA = 4 + 4 + 5 = 13\n5. B -> D -> A -> C: BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\n6. B -> D -> C -> A: BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n\nSo starting at B, the total distances are 16, 15, 15, 13, 14, 13. The minimal is 13.\n\nNext, starting at C:\n\nWe need to visit A, B, D. Permutations of A, B, D:\n\n1. A -> B -> D\n2. A -> D -> B\n3. B -> A -> D\n4. B -> D -> A\n5. D -> A -> B\n6. D -> B -> A\n\nCompute total distances:\n\n1. C -> A -> B -> D: CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\n2. C -> A -> D -> B: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\n3. C -> B -> A -> D: CB + BA + AD = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n4. C -> B -> D -> A: CB + BD + DA = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n5. C -> D -> A -> B: CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n6. C -> D -> B -> A: CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\n\nSo starting at C, the total distances are 15, 14, 15, 12, 15, 13. The minimal is 12.\n\nFinally, starting at D:\n\nWe need to visit A, B, C. Permutations of A, B, C:\n\n1. A -> B -> C\n2. A -> C -> B\n3. B -> A -> C\n4. B -> C -> A\n5. C -> A -> B\n6. C -> B -> A\n\nCompute total distances:\n\n1. D -> A -> B -> C: DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15\n2. D -> A -> C -> B: DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15\n3. D -> B -> A -> C: DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\n4. D -> B -> C -> A: DB + BC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n5. D -> C -> A -> B: DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\n6. D -> C -> B -> A: DC + CB + BA", "answer": "13"}
