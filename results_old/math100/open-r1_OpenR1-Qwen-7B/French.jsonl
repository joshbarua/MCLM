They told me that sin D is 0.7. Let me visualize the diagram first. Point F is at the origin (0,0), E is at (0,7) since the horizontal coordinate is 0 and the vertical is 7. D is at (sqrt(51),7), which is somewhere in the first quadrant. The right angle is at E, because the Asymptote code has a right angle mark at D-E-F. So, DEF is a right-angled triangle at E.\n\nWait, hold on. If the right angle is at E, then sides DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. But the coordinates given are F at (0,0), E at (0,7), so EF is vertical, length 7. D is at (sqrt(51),7), so DE would be the horizontal distance from E to D, which is sqrt(51) units. But the problem says to find DE, which is the horizontal leg. But maybe I need to verify this using the given sine value.\n\nThey say sin D = 0.7. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So angle D is at point D. Let me confirm the sides. Since the right angle is at E, angle D is one of the acute angles. The sides adjacent to angle D would be DE and DF? Wait, in triangle DEF, right-angled at E, so angle D is at the point (sqrt(51),7). Let me see: the triangle has vertices D, E, F. E is (0,7), F is (0,0), D is (sqrt(51),7). So DE is the segment from D to E, which is from (sqrt(51),7) to (0,7). That's a horizontal line, so DE's length is sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). But they want us to find DE given that sin D = 0.7. So maybe I need to compute DE using trigonometry instead of just reading it off the coordinates?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The coordinates are given, so maybe DE is indeed sqrt(51). But let me check with the sine given. Let's see. If angle D is at point D, which is (sqrt(51),7). The right angle is at E, so angle D is one of the acute angles. Let's label the triangle properly. In triangle DEF, right-angled at E. So sides:\n\n- Opposite angle D: that would be EF, which is 7 units.\n\n- Adjacent to angle D: DE, which is the horizontal leg, length sqrt(51).\n\n- Hypotenuse DF: from D (sqrt(51),7) to F (0,0). Let's compute DF's length. The horizontal distance is sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51), vertical distance is 7 - 0 = 7. So DF's length is sqrt( (sqrt(51))^2 + 7^2 ) = sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. So DF is 10.\n\nSo, in triangle DEF, angle D: opposite side is EF = 7, hypotenuse DF = 10. Therefore, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = 7 / 10 = 0.7. Which matches the given value. So DE is adjacent to angle D, which is sqrt(51). Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). But maybe the problem is designed to make sure I confirm this using the sine value instead of just reading it from coordinates.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Supposons que sin D = 0.7\" and asks for DE. So even though the coordinates are given, maybe they want me to use trigonometry to find DE.\n\nLet me try that approach. If I consider angle D in triangle DEF. Since it's a right-angled triangle at E, angle D is one of the acute angles. The sine of angle D is 0.7, which is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D is EF, which is 7. The hypotenuse is DF. So sin D = EF / DF = 7 / DF = 0.7. Therefore, DF = 7 / 0.7 = 10. Then, using Pythagoras, DE can be found as sqrt(DF^2 - EF^2) = sqrt(10^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(100 - 49) = sqrt(51). Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). So even if I approach it this way, I get the same answer. So maybe the coordinates were just there to confirm the answer.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify whether we should use coordinates or trigonometry. Since they gave sin D = 0.7, perhaps they want to use that to compute DE, which would be the adjacent side. Wait, in triangle DEF, angle D: adjacent side is DE, opposite is EF = 7, hypotenuse DF. So if sin D = 0.7, which is opposite over hypotenuse, then cos D would be adjacent over hypotenuse = DE / DF. But since we found DF = 10, then DE = DF * cos D. But we need to find DE, so if we can find cos D, we can multiply by DF. Alternatively, since we know sin D = 0.7, cos D = sqrt(1 - sin^2 D) = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51) ≈ 0.7141. But DE = DF * cos D = 10 * sqrt(0.51). Wait, but sqrt(0.51) is equal to sqrt(51)/10, because sqrt(51)/10 squared is 51/100 = 0.51. So DE = 10 * (sqrt(51)/10) = sqrt(51). So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use coordinates but just the triangle, since EF is 7, DF is 10, DE is sqrt(51). So either way, the answer is sqrt(51). Therefore, DE = sqrt(51). The problem is probably set up so that the coordinates are given, but the key is to use the sine ratio to find the hypotenuse first, then apply Pythagoras. But even if you just compute DE from coordinates, you get sqrt(51). So either approach works here.\n\nI think the answer is sqrt(51). Let me check once again. If DE is the adjacent side to angle D, sin D = 7/10, so DF is 10. Then DE = sqrt(10^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(51). Yep, that's right. So DE is sqrt(51). Therefore, the value of DE is sqrt(51), which can be written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( DE \\) is \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the right triangle \\( DEF \\) with a right angle at \\( E \\), we know the following:\n- \\( EF = 7 \\)\n- \\( \\sin D = 0.7 \\)\n\nWe need to find the length of \\( DE \\).\n\n1. **Identify the sides in the right triangle**:\n   - \\( EF \\) is the side opposite angle \\( D \\).\n   - \\( DF \\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Use the given sine value to find the hypotenuse \\( DF \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\sin D = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( DF \\):\n   \\[\n   DF = \\frac{EF}{\\sin D} = \\frac{7}{0.7} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find \\( DE \\)**:\n   \\[\n   DE = \\sqrt{DF^2 - EF^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 - 7^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 49} = \\sqrt{51}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( DE \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}\\).", "answer": "\\sqrt{51}"}

Let me recall how complex numbers can be rotated. From what I remember, if you have a complex number and you want to rotate it around another complex number, you first translate the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotation in the complex plane is usually around the origin, so you have to shift the point to the origin first, rotate it, and then move it back.\n\nGiven z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i and c = 2 - 3i. Let me write these in terms of their real and imaginary parts. So z has a real part of 2 + √2 and an imaginary part of -(3 + 3√2). The center c has a real part of 2 and an imaginary part of -3.\n\nFirst, I need to translate z by subtracting the center c. That is, compute z - c. Let's do that step by step.\n\nThe real part of z is 2 + √2, and the real part of c is 2. So subtracting those gives (2 + √2) - 2 = √2.\n\nThe imaginary part of z is -(3 + 3√2), and the imaginary part of c is -3. Subtracting those gives -(3 + 3√2) - (-3) = -(3 + 3√2) + 3 = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2. So z - c is √2 - 3√2 i. That simplifies to √2(1 - 3i). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, once we have the translated point, which is √2 - 3√2 i, we need to rotate this by π/4 radians counterclockwise. Rotating a complex number by an angle θ in the complex plane can be done by multiplying it by e^(iθ). Since we're rotating counterclockwise by π/4, θ is π/4. So the rotation factor is e^(iπ/4) which is cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2.\n\nSo we need to multiply the translated point (√2 - 3√2 i) by (√2/2 + i√2/2). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let me write both complex numbers:\n\nTranslated point: √2 - 3√2 i\n\nRotation factor: √2/2 + i√2/2\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n(√2)(√2/2) + (√2)(i√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(i√2/2)\n\nLet's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: √2 * i√2/2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\nThird term: -3√2 i * √2/2 = -3*(2i)/2 = -3i\n\nFourth term: -3√2 i * i√2/2. Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants: -3√2 * √2 = -3*(2) = -6\n\nThen multiply the i terms: i * i = i² = -1\n\nSo the fourth term is -6*(-1) = 6\n\nWait, let me check that again. The fourth term is:\n\n(-3√2 i) * (i√2/2) = (-3√2 * √2) * (i * i) / 2\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the order. Let me recast:\n\n= (-3√2 * i) * (i√2 / 2) = (-3√2 * √2) * (i * i) / 2\n\nBut actually, it's (-3√2)(i) multiplied by (i√2 / 2). So:\n\nFirst, multiply the coefficients: (-3√2)(√2 / 2) = (-3*2)/2 = -3\n\nThen multiply the imaginary parts: i * i = i² = -1\n\nSo the fourth term is -3 * (-1) = 3\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, let me check again.\n\nWait, (-3√2 i) * (i√2 / 2) = (-3√2 * √2 / 2) * (i * i) = (-3*2 / 2) * (-1) = (-3) * (-1) = 3. Yes, that's correct. So the fourth term is 3.\n\nSo putting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: i\n\nThird term: -3i\n\nFourth term: 3\n\nSo total: 1 + 3 + i - 3i = 4 - 2i\n\nTherefore, the result of the multiplication is 4 - 2i.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify that again step by step.\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: √2 * i√2/2 = (√2 * √2)/2 * i = 2/2 * i = i\n\nThird term: -3√2 i * √2/2 = -3*(√2 * √2)/2 * i = -3*(2)/2 * i = -3i\n\nFourth term: -3√2 i * i√2/2 = -3*√2*√2/2 * i^2 = -3*2/2*(-1) = -3*(-1) = 3\n\nSo adding all terms: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. Yes, that's correct. So the rotated point is 4 - 2i.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me check if I did the algebra correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using polar form would be better. Let's see.\n\nThe translated point is √2 - 3√2 i. Let me compute its magnitude and angle.\n\nMagnitude: sqrt( (√2)^2 + ( -3√2 )^2 ) = sqrt( 2 + 9*2 ) = sqrt(2 + 18) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5)\n\nThe angle θ: arctangent of (-3√2 / √2 ) = arctangent (-3). So θ is arctan(-3). Since the point is in the fourth quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary), θ is negative or we can represent it as 2π - arctan(3).\n\nBut when we rotate it by π/4, the new angle would be θ + π/4.\n\nBut maybe using rotation formula in polar form is more complicated here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, let me check again. Multiplying (√2 - 3√2 i) by (√2/2 + i√2/2). Let's write this as:\n\n(√2)(√2/2) + (√2)(i√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(i√2/2)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. √2 * √2/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\n2. √2 * i√2/2 = (√2 * √2)/2 * i = 2/2 * i = i\n\n3. -3√2 i * √2/2 = (-3√2 * √2)/2 * i = (-3*2)/2 * i = -3i\n\n4. -3√2 i * i√2/2 = (-3√2 * √2)/2 * i^2 = (-3*2)/2 * (-1) = (-6)/2 * (-1) = -3 * (-1) = 3\n\nSo total: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, after translating back by adding c, which is 2 - 3i, we get w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the rotation is applied to z - c, which is √2 - 3√2 i. Then, after rotating, we add c back. So w = (rotated point) + c.\n\nBut the rotated point is 4 - 2i. Then adding c = 2 - 3i gives 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i = 6 - 5i. So w = 6 - 5i.\n\nBut let me confirm that the rotation is indeed done correctly. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for rotating a point z around c by angle θ is:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ)\n\nIn this case, θ is π/4. So e^(iπ/4) = cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2.\n\nTherefore, w = c + (z - c)(√2/2 + i√2/2)\n\nWe already calculated z - c = √2 - 3√2 i.\n\nSo (z - c)(√2/2 + i√2/2) = (√2 - 3√2 i)(√2/2 + i√2/2) = 4 - 2i as above.\n\nTherefore, w = c + (4 - 2i) = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the multiplication was correct. Because sometimes when multiplying complex numbers, sign errors can happen.\n\nWait, in the fourth term: (-3√2 i) * (i√2/2) = (-3√2 * √2)/2 * i^2 = (-3*2)/2 * (-1) = (-6)/2 * (-1) = -3 * (-1) = 3. That's correct. So the fourth term is 3.\n\nSo adding up all terms: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. Then adding c (2 - 3i) gives 4 + 2 = 6, -2i -3i = -5i. So w = 6 -5i. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if translating z by c first is correct. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because the rotation is around c, so we have to translate z to the origin relative to c, rotate, then translate back. That is, w = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had z - c, multiply by rotation factor, then add c back. So yes, 6 -5i.\n\nWait, but let me check if the rotation by π/4 is indeed counterclockwise. Since we're using e^(iπ/4), which is indeed a counterclockwise rotation. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me see.\n\nThe original point z is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). The center c is (2, -3). So translating z by subtracting c gives ( (2 + √2) - 2, (-3 - 3√2) - (-3) ) = (√2, -3√2). Then rotating this point (√2, -3√2) by π/4 counterclockwise around the origin.\n\nThe rotation matrix for π/4 is [cosθ, -sinθ; sinθ, cosθ]. So:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nHere, θ = π/4, so cosθ = sinθ = √2/2.\n\nSo plugging in x = √2, y = -3√2:\n\nx' = √2*(√2/2) - (-3√2)*(√2/2) = (√2*√2)/2 + (3√2*√2)/2 = (2)/2 + (3*2)/2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\ny' = √2*(√2/2) + (-3√2)*(√2/2) = (2)/2 + (-3*2)/2 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nSo the rotated point is (4, -2). Then translating back by adding c's coordinates (2, -3): (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5). Therefore, w = 6 -5i. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6 -5i.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let's compute the rotation using coordinates:\n\nOriginal translated point: (√2, -3√2)\n\nRotation by π/4:\n\nx' = √2 * cos(π/4) - (-3√2) * sin(π/4) = √2*(√2/2) + 3√2*(√2/2) = (2/2) + (3*2)/2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\ny' = √2 * sin(π/4) + (-3√2) * cos(π/4) = √2*(√2/2) - 3√2*(√2/2) = (2/2) - (3*2)/2 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nYes, so the rotated point is (4, -2). Adding back c (2, -3) gives (6, -5), which is 6 -5i. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 6 -5i.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe complex number \\( w \\) is \\boxed{6 - 5i}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the complex number \\( w \\) which is the result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians counterclockwise, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\)**:\n   \\[\n   z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotate the translated point by", "answer": "6 - 5i"}
{"original_question": "Simplifiez $\\sqrt{242}$.", "question": "Simplifiez $\\sqrt{242}$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the square root of 242. Hmm, let me think. I remember that simplifying square roots involves breaking down the number into its prime factors and then seeing if any of those factors can be taken out of the square root. Let me start by factoring 242.\n\nFirst, I know that 242 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 242 by 2. 242 divided by 2 is 121. Okay, so 242 = 2 × 121. Now, I need to factor 121. Hmm, 121... that's a common square number. Wait, 11 times 11 is 121. So, 121 = 11 × 11. Putting that together, the prime factorization of 242 is 2 × 11 × 11. \n\nSo, the square root of 242 can be written as the square root of (2 × 11 × 11). Now, since square roots can be split into the product of square roots, that would be sqrt(2) × sqrt(11 × 11). The square root of 11 × 11 is just 11, right? Because sqrt(n × n) = n. So, sqrt(121) is 11. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(242) = sqrt(2 × 11 × 11) = sqrt(2) × sqrt(11 × 11) = sqrt(2) × 11. Which simplifies to 11 × sqrt(2). So, the simplified form of sqrt(242) is 11√2. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If I square 11√2, do I get 242? Let's see. (11√2)^2 = 11^2 × (√2)^2 = 121 × 2 = 242. Yep, that checks out. So, that seems correct. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss any other factors. Let's try dividing 242 by other primes. After dividing by 2, we had 121. 121 is 11 squared, so no other factors. So, the prime factors are indeed 2, 11, and 11. So, there's no other factor that's a square number except for 11 squared. So, sqrt(242) can't be simplified further beyond 11√2. \n\nI think that's it. So, the simplified form is 11 times the square root of 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified form of $\\sqrt{242}$ is \\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{242}\\), we start by factoring 242 into its prime factors. \n\nFirst, we divide 242 by 2:\n\\[\n242 \\div 2 = 121\n\\]\nNext, we factor 121, which is a perfect square:\n\\[\n121 = 11 \\times 11\n\\]\nThus, the prime factorization of 242 is:\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\times 11 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nWe can then express the square root of 242 using these prime factors:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 11 \\times 11}\n\\]\n\nSince the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we split this into:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 \\times 11 \\times 11} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{11 \\times 11}\n\\]\n\nThe square root of \\(11 \\times 11\\) is 11, so we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11 \\times 11} = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 11 = 11\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}\\).", "answer": "11\\sqrt2"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling how circular permutations work. Normally, for n people sitting around a round table, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But here, we have a specific condition where three people must be seated together. \n\nFirst, maybe I can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single entity or \"block.\" If they're sitting together, then instead of 8 separate people, we have this block plus the remaining 5 individuals. So that's 1 block + 5 people = 6 \"units\" in total. \n\nFor circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around the table would be (6-1)! = 5! because it's circular. But wait, within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in different ways. How many ways can they arrange themselves within the block? That's 3! since there are three people. \n\nSo, multiplying the number of arrangements of the blocks by the number of arrangements within the block gives us 5! * 3!. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nBut hold on, does the circular arrangement of the blocks affect the calculation? Normally, in circular permutations, fixing one position removes the rotational symmetry. However, when we have a block that's part of the arrangement, does fixing the block's position matter? Let me think. \n\nIf we consider the block as a single entity, arranging 6 entities around a circular table would indeed be (6-1)! = 5!. Then, within the block, there are 3! arrangements. So multiplying these together gives the total number of arrangements. \n\nBut let me verify with a smaller example. Suppose there are 3 people who must sit together around a table with 3 people. Then, the number of arrangements would be (3-1)! * 3! = 2! * 6 = 12. But if all three are sitting together, there are actually only 2 distinct arrangements, right? Because in a circular table, all three sitting together can be rotated, but since they have to sit together, the only thing that matters is their order relative to each other. Wait, no, actually, if all three are sitting together, the circular arrangement would have (3-1)! = 2 ways, and within the block, 3! = 6, so total 12. But if they have to be seated together, the number of distinct seating arrangements should be 2 * 1 = 2? Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait, no. Let's think. If three people must sit together at a circular table with three seats, there's only one way to arrange them because once you fix their block, rotating the entire table doesn't change the arrangement. But within the block, they can be arranged in 3! ways. So total arrangements would be 1 (for the block's position) * 3! = 6. But since it's a circular table, arranging the block in different rotations would be considered the same. Wait, but if the block is the entire table, then there's no rotation possible. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nActually, in circular permutations, when we have a block, we fix the block's position relative to the table. So, for example, if we have a block of 3 people, we can fix that block's position, and then arrange the remaining people. But since the block is a single entity, arranging it around the table would just be rotating the block, but if the block is fixed, then the number of arrangements is (n-1)! for the blocks. Wait, maybe I need to recall the formula for circular permutations with blocks. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is similar to linear arrangements. For linear arrangements, if you have k people who must be together, you treat them as a block, so you have (n - k + 1)! arrangements, and then multiply by k! for the internal arrangements. So for circular arrangements, maybe it's (n - k)! * k!? \n\nWait, let me check. If we have n people around a circular table, and k of them must be together, then the number of arrangements is (n - k)! * k!. Let me test this with n=3 and k=3. Then it would be (3-3)! * 3! = 0! * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6, which matches. If n=4 and k=2, then (4-2)! * 2! = 2! * 2 = 4. Let's see, linear arrangements would be 3! * 2 = 12, but circular arrangements would be 12 / 4 = 3? Wait, no. Wait, for circular arrangements where two people must be together, we can treat them as a block, so we have 3 units: the block and the other two people. So (3-1)! * 2! = 2! * 2 = 4. But in reality, for circular arrangements, fixing the block's position, we have 2! arrangements for the remaining two people, and 2! arrangements within the block, so 2! * 2! = 4. That seems correct. \n\nSo the formula (n - k)! * k! works for circular arrangements. Therefore, in the given problem, n=8, k=3. So the number of arrangements would be (8 - 3)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 120 * 6 = 720. Wait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, but in circular permutations, the formula is different. For linear permutations, the number is n! / k! * k! = n! for arranging k people together. Wait, no. Wait, for linear arrangements, if you have k people who must be together, you treat them as a block, so you have (n - k + 1)! ways to arrange the blocks, and then multiply by k! for the internal arrangements. So total is (n - k + 1)! * k!.\n\nBut for circular arrangements, the formula is different because rotations are considered the same. So when we have a block, how does that affect the count? \n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have 8 people around a circular table, and Pierre, Rosa, Thomas must be together. Let's fix their block. Then, the number of ways to arrange the block around the table is (8 - 3)! because in circular permutations, fixing one position removes the rotational symmetry. Wait, but if we fix the block's position, then the remaining 5 people can be arranged in (8 - 3)! ways? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Treat the three people (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) as a single block. Now, we have 6 entities to arrange around the table: the block and the other 5 individuals.\n\n2. The number of ways to arrange 6 entities around a circular table is (6 - 1)! = 5!.\n\n3. Within the block, the three people can be arranged in 3! ways.\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 5! * 3! = 120 * 6 = 720.\n\nBut let me verify this with another example. Suppose there are 4 people, and 2 of them must sit together. Then, according to the formula, it would be (4 - 2)! * 2! = 2! * 2 = 4. Let's check manually. \n\nIn a circular table with 4 seats, if two people must sit together. Treat them as a block, so we have 3 entities: the block and the other two people. The number of circular arrangements is (3 - 1)! = 2. Then, within the block, 2! = 2. Total arrangements: 2 * 2 = 4. Let's list them:\n\nPositions around the table. Let the block be AB (A and B must be together). The possible arrangements are:\n\n1. AB, C, D\n\n2. AB, D, C\n\n3. BA, C, D\n\n4. BA, D, C\n\nBut in circular arrangements, AB is the same as BA if we rotate. Wait, but in a circle, AB and BA are different unless the block is considered as a single entity. Wait, no. If the block is treated as a single entity, then rotating the block would just rotate the entire arrangement. So if the block is in positions 1-2, then rotating it would move it to positions 2-3, etc. But since we're treating the block as a single entity, the number of circular arrangements is (n - k)! where n is the total number of entities. Wait, in the case of 4 people with 2 together, we have 3 entities: the block and two individuals. So circular arrangements are (3 - 1)! = 2. Then, within the block, 2! = 2. So total 4. \n\nBut when I list them, if the block is AB, then the two possible arrangements are AB-C-D and AB-D-C. Rotating the block would not change the arrangement because the block is considered as a single entity. However, if the block is BA, that's a different arrangement. So in total, 2 (positions of the block) * 2 (internal arrangements) = 4. That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem: 8 people, 3 must sit together. Treat them as a block, so 6 entities. Circular arrangements: (6 - 1)! = 5! = 120. Internal arrangements: 3! = 6. Total: 120 * 6 = 720. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose we fix the block in one position to account for the circular table. Then, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways, and the block can be arranged internally in 3! ways. So the total is 5! * 3! = 720. That seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, if we didn't fix the block, then the number of circular arrangements would be (6 - 1)! * 3! = 5! * 3! = 720. Yes, that matches. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5! multiplied by 3! which is 120 * 6 = 720. So 720 ways. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose we have 3 people sitting together in a circular table. The formula (n - k)! * k! gives (3 - 3)! * 3! = 0! * 6 = 6. Which is correct, as they can be arranged in a circle in 6 ways. So that works. \n\nAnother test case: 4 people, 2 must sit together. As above, 2! * 2! = 4. Which works. \n\nSo applying the same formula to 8 people with 3 together: (8 - 3)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 720. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 720. So the number of ways is 720. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways is \\boxed{720}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all sit together, we can treat them as a single block. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the remaining 5 individuals) around a circular table.\n\n1. **Arranging the 6 units around the table**: For circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) units is \\((n-1)!\\). Here, \\( n = 6 \\), so the number of ways is \\((6-1)! = 5!\\).\n\n2. **Arranging Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: The three people can be arranged among themselves in \\(3!\\) ways.\n\nMultiplying these two results gives the total number of arrangements:\n\\[\n5! \\times 3! = 120 \\times 6 = 720\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around the table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas together is \\(\\boxed{720}\\).", "answer": "720"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that the binomial theorem is used to expand expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\). The general term in the expansion is given by \\(\\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(a = 10x^3\\), \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n = 5\\). \n\nThe constant term would be the term where the power of \\(x\\) is zero.

Let's compute the exponent of \\(x\\) in this term. \n\nFor \\((10x^3)^{5 - k}\\), the exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(3(5 - k)\\). For \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\), the exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(-2k\\). So, combining these, the total exponent of \\(x\\) in the term is \\(3(5 - k) - 2k\\). \n\nWe want this exponent to be zero for the constant term. So, setting up the equation:\n\n\\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 0\\)\n\nLet me solve this equation for \\(k\\). \n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n\\(15 - 3k - 2k = 0\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(15 - 5k = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\(-5k = -15\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nOkay, so when \\(k = 3\\), the term will be constant with respect to \\(x\\).

Then, \\(10x^3\\) squared is \\(100x^6\\), and \\(-1/(2x^2)\\) cubed is \\(-1/(8x^6)\\). Multiplying those gives \\(100/8 = 12.5\\), but with the negative sign, it's \\(-12.5\\), and 12.5 times 10 is 125. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\) is 10, so 10 * 100 * (-1/8) = 10 * (100/8) * (-1) = 10 * 12.5 * (-1) = -125. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(-125\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. For example, using the expansion step by step.

The problem says that if n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, we need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, okay. So, n ≡ 2 mod 7, which means that n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to go that far. Maybe I can substitute n with 2 in the expression and compute the result modulo 7. Because if n ≡ 2 mod 7, then each term in the product (n + 2), (n + 4), (n + 6) would be congruent to (2 + 2), (2 + 4), (2 + 6) modulo 7. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then:\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 ≡ 8 mod 7\n\nBut 8 mod 7 is 1, right? Because 7*1=7, so 8-7=1. So that term is 1 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) ≡ 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.\n\nCalculating that: 4*6 is 24, and 24*1 is 24. Then 24 mod 7. Let's compute 7*3=21, so 24-21=3. So 24 mod 7 is 3. Therefore, the remainder is 3. So the answer should be 3.\n\nWait, let me verify this step by step again to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nStarting with n ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7. Correct.\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7. Correct.\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 mod 7. 8 - 7 = 1, so 1 mod 7. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 4 * 6 * 1. 4*6 is indeed 24. 24 divided by 7 is 3 with remainder 3. So 24 mod 7 is 3. So the remainder is 3. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with actual numbers. Let's pick a number n that is congruent to 2 mod 7. For example, n = 2. Then compute (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 192. Then divide 192 by 7. 7*27=189, so 192-189=3. So remainder is 3. That checks out.\n\nAnother example: n = 9 (since 9 ≡ 2 mod 7, because 9 - 2 =7). Then (9 + 2)(9 + 4)(9 + 6) = 11 * 13 * 15. Let's compute this. 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Now divide 2145 by 7. 7*300=2100, 2145-2100=45. 45 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, remainder 3. So 2145 mod 7 is 3. Again, remainder 3. So that works.\n\nAnother example: n=16 (16 ≡ 2 mod 7, since 16-2=14). Then (16 +2)(16 +4)(16 +6)=18*20*22. 18*20=360, 360*22=7920. Divide 7920 by 7. 7*1131=7917, so 7920-7917=3. Remainder 3. Again, same result.\n\nSo seems like the remainder is always 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without plugging in numbers. Let's see.\n\nSince n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n = 7k + 2. Then:\n\nn + 2 = 7k + 4\n\nn + 4 = 7k + 6\n\nn + 6 = 7k + 8\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\n(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\n\nBut when expanding this, all terms with 7k will be multiples of 7, so modulo 7, the entire expression is equivalent to 4*6*8 mod 7.\n\nBut 8 mod 7 is 1, so 4*6*1=24, which mod 7 is 3. So same result. So regardless of k, the remainder is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nSo I think that's correct. The remainder is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3}\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\) into each term of the product:\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nSince \\( 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\), the product becomes:\n\\[\n(4)(6)(1) \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the product:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n24 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:\n\\[\n24 \\div 7 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).", "answer": "3"}

Quel est le nombre minimum de degrés qu'il doit être tourné jusqu'à ce qu'il coïncide avec sa position d'origine ?", "question": "Un pentagone régulier est tourné dans le sens antihoraire autour de son centre. Quel est le nombre minimum de degrés qu'il doit être tourné jusqu'à ce qu'il coïncide avec sa position d'origine ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon has to be rotated anticlockwise around its center to come back to its original position. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a regular pentagon is. It's a five-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle should be 108 degrees because the formula for internal angles is (n-2)*180/n, where n is the number of sides. So, (5-2)*180/5 = 3*180/5 = 540/5 = 108. Yeah, that's right.\n\nBut the question is about rotation. When you rotate a regular polygon around its center, the angle of rotation that maps it onto itself is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides. So for a pentagon, that would be 360/5 = 72 degrees. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If you rotate a regular pentagon by 72 degrees, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex. So after 5 such rotations, it would have gone all the way around and returned to the original position. So 72 degrees is the smallest angle needed. But the question says \"minimum number of degrees\" until it coincides with its original position. So 72 degrees is the answer? But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the concept of rotational symmetry. The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5, meaning there are 5 positions where it looks the same. So the angle between each symmetry position is 360/5 = 72 degrees. So the minimal angle is indeed 72 degrees. But let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think about the vertices. A regular pentagon has five vertices. If you rotate it by 72 degrees, each vertex moves to the next one's position. So after one rotation, vertex 1 is where vertex 2 was, vertex 2 is where vertex 3 was, and so on. After five rotations, all vertices would have cycled through all positions and returned to their original spots. Therefore, 72 degrees is the minimal angle required.\n\nWait, but is there a smaller angle that could also work? For example, 36 degrees. If you rotate by 36 degrees, would that map the pentagon onto itself? Let's see. If you rotate by 36 degrees, which is half of 72, would that align the vertices? Let's imagine. Suppose we have a regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E. If we rotate it by 36 degrees, vertex A would move to somewhere between A and B, but since the pentagon has five-fold symmetry, each vertex is 72 degrees apart. So moving by 36 degrees would not land on another vertex. Therefore, the pentagon would not coincide with its original position. So 36 degrees would not work. Similarly, 108 degrees? Let's see. 108 is 3/5 of 180. Wait, 108 is the internal angle. But rotating the pentagon by 108 degrees would not align the vertices. Let me check. If you rotate the pentagon by 108 degrees, how many times does that fit into 360? 360 divided by 108 is 3.333..., which is not an integer, so it's not a symmetry. Therefore, 108 degrees is not a rotational symmetry.\n\nSo, returning to the original thought, the minimal angle is 72 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be 72 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't a different way to calculate this. The formula for the rotational symmetry angle is 360 divided by the number of sides. Since a pentagon has 5 sides, 360/5=72. So that's the minimal angle. Therefore, the pentagon must be rotated by 72 degrees to align with its original position. So the answer is 72 degrees. But let me confirm with a real-life example. If you take a regular pentagon and rotate it by 72 degrees, does it look the same? Yes, because each vertex is symmetric. So after 5 rotations of 72 degrees each, you get back to the original position. So, yes, 72 degrees is correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of degrees required is 72 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum number of degrees is \\boxed{72}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated anticlockwise around its center to coincide with its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five sides of equal length and five internal angles of 108 degrees each. \n\nThe key concept here is rotational symmetry. A regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides has rotational symmetry of order \\( n \\), meaning it can be rotated by \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} \\) degrees to map itself onto itself. For a pentagon, \\( n = 5 \\), so the angle of rotational symmetry is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis means that rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will align it with its original position. Testing smaller angles, such as 36 degrees or 108 degrees, does not result in the pentagon coinciding with its original position because these angles do not divide evenly into 360 degrees. \n\nThus, the minimum number of degrees required for the pentagon to coincide with its original position is indeed 72 degrees.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]", "answer": "72"}

Quelle est la valeur de $x + y$ ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a parallelogram with coordinates (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y), where x is greater than 7. I need to find the value of x + y. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. So, maybe I can use the properties of midpoints or vectors here. Let me jot down the given points: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). The order of the points might matter here. Are these points listed in order? The problem says \"les coordinates d'un parallélogramme sont (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) et (x, y)\", so probably in order, but not necessarily clockwise or counterclockwise. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the order of the vertices matters because adjacent vertices are connected by sides.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the order of the points. Hmm. That might complicate things. If the points are given in order, then it's a parallelogram ABCD with vertices A, B, C, D in that order. But if they are not in order, then we need to figure out which points are adjacent.\n\nBut maybe the problem assumes that the points are given in order. Let me check the original problem again. It says: \"Quelques sont (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) et (x, y) et x > 7. Quelle est la valeur de x + y?\" So, the French translation is \"The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y), with x > 7. What is the value of x + y?\" The wording \"sont\" (are) might imply that these four points are the vertices of the parallelogram, listed in order. So, perhaps A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y), forming a parallelogram. But we need to verify if this order makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is not specified, so we have to consider different configurations. But since x is greater than 7, and the existing points are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), which are all around x=5 to 7, except (6,8) which is at x=6. So, maybe the fourth point is to the right of x=7. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst, let's assume the points are given in order: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y). Then, in a parallelogram, the vector from A to B should be the same as the vector from D to C. Similarly, the vector from B to C should be the same as the vector from A to D.\n\nLet me compute vectors. The vector AB is B - A = (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). The vector BC is C - B = (7-6,4-8) = (1,-4). If ABCD is a parallelogram, then vector DC should be equal to vector AB, and vector AD should be equal to vector BC.\n\nSo, vector DC = C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y) should equal vector AB = (1,5). Therefore:\n\n7 - x = 1 => x = 7 - 1 = 6\n\nBut the problem states x > 7, so this would mean x=6 which contradicts. Therefore, this configuration is invalid. So, maybe the order is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y), but with a different pairing of sides. Wait, perhaps the sides are AB and BC, then CD and DA. Hmm, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So, AB should be equal and parallel to CD, and BC equal and parallel to DA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points are not in order. Let's try different pairings. Let's suppose that AB is one side, BC is another side, but then CD and DA would be the other sides. Wait, but if we take AB and BC as adjacent sides, then the opposite sides would be CD and DA. But since we have four points, maybe we need to compute the missing point based on the properties.\n\nAlternatively, since a parallelogram can be defined by two vectors originating from the same point. So, if we take point A(5,3) as the origin, then vectors AB and AD would define the parallelogram. Then point B would be A + AB, point D would be A + AD, and point C would be A + AB + AD.\n\nBut in the given points, we have three points: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y). So, maybe AB is vector (1,5), and then AD is another vector. If we can figure out AD such that point D is (5 + a, 3 + b), and point C is A + AB + AD = (5 +1 + a, 3 +5 + b) = (6 + a, 8 + b). But point C is given as (7,4). So:\n\n6 + a = 7 => a = 1\n\n8 + b = 4 => b = -4\n\nTherefore, vector AD is (1, -4). Therefore, point D would be A + AD = (5 +1, 3 -4) = (6, -1). But then, since x >7, this would give x=6, which is invalid. So, again, conflict. Therefore, this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vectors are different. Let's suppose that point A is (5,3), point B is (6,8), point C is (7,4). Then, if we consider AB and BC as sides, then we can find point D such that AD is equal and parallel to BC, and CD is equal and parallel to AB.\n\nWait, in a parallelogram, the fourth vertex can be found by adding the vector from A to B to point C. So, point D = C + AB. Vector AB is (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). So, D = (7 +1, 4 +5) = (8,9). Then, x=8, y=9, so x+y=17. But let's check if this forms a parallelogram.\n\nIf D is (8,9), then sides AB, BC, CD, DA. AB is from (5,3) to (6,8), BC is from (6,8) to (7,4), CD is from (7,4) to (8,9), DA is from (8,9) to (5,3). Wait, but CD would be (8-7,9-4)=(1,5), which is same as AB. DA is (5-8,3-9)=(-3,-6), which is same as BC's negative? Wait, BC is (1,-4), so DA is (-1,4)? Wait, no. Wait, vector DA is from D to A, which is (5-8,3-9)=(-3,-6). Vector BC is (7-6,4-8)=(1,-4). So, DA is not equal to BC. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. If the parallelogram is ABCD, then the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. In a parallelogram, AB should be equal and parallel to CD, and BC equal and parallel to DA. So, if AB is vector (1,5), then CD should also be (1,5). But point C is (7,4), so D would be C - AB = (7-1,4-5)=(6,-1). Then DA would be from D(6,-1) to A(5,3), which is (-1,4). And BC is from B(6,8) to C(7,4), which is (1,-4). So DA is (-1,4), which is the negative of BC. So, DA is equal and opposite to BC. So, that works. Then in this case, D is (6,-1), but x=6 which is not greater than 7. So, that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Let's suppose that the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y), but arranged in a different order. For example, maybe the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, but in a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given points are not in order. Let's think differently. Let's use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. So, the midpoint of diagonal AC should be the same as the midpoint of diagonal BD.\n\nIf we consider points A(5,3) and C(7,4), their midpoint is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6, 3.5). Then, the midpoint of diagonal BD should also be (6, 3.5). Therefore, if B is (6,8), then D should be such that midpoint of BD is (6,3.5). So, coordinates of D would be (2*6 -6, 2*3.5 -8) = (12-6, 7-8) = (6, -1). Again, D is (6,-1), which gives x=6, which is not greater than 7. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagonals are AC and BD, but the other diagonal is AD and BC. Wait, no, diagonals are AC and BD. So, regardless of the order, the midpoint should be the same. So, if we take another pair of points as diagonals. Suppose that the diagonals are AB and CD. Then their midpoints should be the same. Let's check.\n\nIf diagonal AB is from A(5,3) to B(6,8), midpoint is ( (5+6)/2, (3+8)/2 ) = (5.5, 5.5). Then diagonal CD would need to have the same midpoint. If C is (7,4), then D would be such that midpoint of CD is (5.5,5.5). So, coordinates of D would be (2*5.5 -7, 2*5.5 -4) = (11 -7, 11 -4) = (4,7). Then x=4, which is less than 7, but the problem states x >7, so invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagonals are AD and BC. Then their midpoints should be the same. Let's see. If diagonal AD is from A(5,3) to D(x,y), midpoint is ( (5+x)/2, (3+y)/2 ). Diagonal BC is from B(6,8) to C(7,4), midpoint is ( (6+7)/2, (8+4)/2 ) = (6.5, 6). Therefore, setting these midpoints equal:\n\n( (5+x)/2, (3+y)/2 ) = (6.5, 6 )\n\nSolving:\n\n(5 + x)/2 = 6.5 => 5 + x = 13 => x = 8\n\n(3 + y)/2 = 6 => 3 + y = 12 => y = 9\n\nTherefore, D would be (8,9), so x=8, y=9, x+y=17. Let's check if this forms a parallelogram.\n\nSo, points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9). Let's check the sides:\n\nAB: (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5)\n\nBC: (7-6,4-8) = (1,-4)\n\nCD: (8-7,9-4) = (1,5)\n\nDA: (5-8,3-9) = (-3,-6)\n\nWait, AB and CD are both (1,5), which is good. BC is (1,-4), DA is (-3,-6). Hmm, BC and DA are not the same. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal and parallel. So, AB should equal CD, and BC should equal DA. But BC is (1,-4), DA is (-3,-6). These are not the same. So, this is not a parallelogram. So, this approach is invalid.\n\nWait, but according to the midpoints, the diagonals should bisect each other. So, if we set the midpoints equal, then the diagonals bisect each other, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the figure is a parallelogram. Wait, no, actually, in a quadrilateral, if the diagonals bisect each other, then it is a parallelogram. So, if the midpoint of AD is the same as the midpoint of BC, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. But in this case, the sides are not matching. So, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the vectors. Let's see. If diagonals are AD and BC with midpoints at (6.5,6), then the condition is satisfied, but the sides are not equal. So, that would not form a parallelogram. Therefore, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider another pair of diagonals. Suppose the diagonals are AC and BD. Wait, we tried that earlier, which gave D(6,-1), which is invalid. Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are AB and CD. Wait, we tried that too, which gave D(4,7), which is invalid. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the given points are not in order. So, perhaps the sides are not AB, BC, CD, DA but a different order. Let me think. Let's suppose that the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y), but arranged in a different order, such that the sides are AB, BD, DC, CA or something. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use vectors. Let's suppose that the parallelogram has three points: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). Let's assume that AB and AC are adjacent sides. Then, the vector AB is (1,5), and the vector AC is (2,1). Then, the fourth point D would be B + AC = (6 +2, 8 +", "answer": "17"}

Quelle est la valeur de $\\tan A$ ?", "question": "Dans le triangle rectangle $ABC$ avec $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$, nous avons $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$. Quelle est la valeur de $\\tan A$ ?", "response": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a right triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. They tell me that sin A is equal to twice the cosine of A, and I need to find the value of tan A. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the trigonometric ratios are defined based on the sides opposite and adjacent to the angles. Since angle B is 90 degrees, angles A and C must add up to 90 degrees. So angle A is acute, and so is angle C. The problem gives me a relationship between sin A and cos A: sin A = 2 cos A. And I need to find tan A. But tan A is sin A over cos A, right? So if I can find sin A and cos A individually, or relate them in a way that allows me to compute tan A directly, that would work.\n\nGiven that sin A = 2 cos A, maybe I can express tan A in terms of this. Since tan A is sin A / cos A, if I substitute sin A with 2 cos A, then tan A would be (2 cos A) / cos A, which simplifies to 2. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. If sin A = 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. That's right? Because tan A is sin A / cos A. So if sin A is twice cos A, then tan A is 2. Hmm, that seems almost too easy. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach. Let's consider the triangle. Since angle B is 90 degrees, sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively. Wait, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. But angle B is 90 degrees, so side b is the hypotenuse. So, in triangle ABC, right-angled at B, sides are: AB, BC, and AC. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me draw the triangle mentally. Let's say point B is the right angle, so sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then angle A is at point A, so the sides opposite angle A is BC, adjacent is AB. Similarly, angle C is at point C, opposite is AB, adjacent is BC.\n\nSo, sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AC, and cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AB / AC. The problem states that sin A = 2 cos A, so BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC). Multiplying both sides by AC gives BC = 2 AB. So the side opposite angle A is twice the side adjacent to angle A. Therefore, BC = 2 AB.\n\nThen tan A = opposite / adjacent = BC / AB = 2 AB / AB = 2. So that confirms it again. So tan A is 2. So maybe that's the answer. But let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, we know that (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 = (AC)^2. From the previous result, BC = 2 AB. Let's let AB = x, then BC = 2x. Then AC would be sqrt(x^2 + (2x)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + 4x^2) = sqrt(5x^2) = x sqrt(5). Therefore, sides are AB = x, BC = 2x, AC = x sqrt(5). Then sin A = BC / AC = 2x / (x sqrt(5)) = 2 / sqrt(5), and cos A = AB / AC = x / (x sqrt(5)) = 1 / sqrt(5). So sin A = 2 / sqrt(5) and cos A = 1 / sqrt(5). Then sin A / cos A = (2 / sqrt(5)) / (1 / sqrt(5)) = 2, which is 2. So that's consistent. Therefore, tan A is indeed 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1. Since sin A = 2 cos A, substitute that in. So (2 cos A)^2 + cos^2 A = 1. That is 4 cos^2 A + cos^2 A = 1, so 5 cos^2 A = 1. Therefore, cos^2 A = 1/5, so cos A = 1/sqrt(5) or -1/sqrt(5). But since angle A is acute (between 0 and 90 degrees), cosine is positive. So cos A = 1/sqrt(5). Then sin A = 2 cos A = 2/sqrt(5). Therefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (2/sqrt(5)) / (1/sqrt(5)) = 2. So that's another way to confirm.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach—whether by using the ratio directly, by considering the sides of the triangle, by applying the Pythagorean theorem, or by using the fundamental trigonometric identity—we end up with tan A = 2. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't a trick or a different interpretation here. The problem says \"triangle rectangle ABC\" which translates to \"right triangle ABC\" with angle B being 90 degrees. So angle A and angle C are the other two angles, which must add up to 90 degrees. The given condition is sin A = 2 cos A, which as we saw leads directly to tan A = 2. There's no ambiguity here because angle A is acute, so all the trigonometric functions are positive. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nI think that's solid. All methods lead to the same conclusion. So I can confidently say that tan A is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\tan A$ is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(\\angle B = 90^\\circ\\), we know that \\(\\sin A = 2 \\cos A\\).

Alright, let's start by recalling what vertical and horizontal asymptotes are.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator and find its roots. The denominator here is x² - 5x -14. Let me try to factor that quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7. Let me check: 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). Wait, let's verify that: (x + 2)(x - 7) = x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes occur at x = -2 and x = 7 because those are the values that make the denominator zero. But I should check if the numerator is also zero at these points. The numerator is 2x, so when x = -2, the numerator is -4, and when x = 7, the numerator is 14. Since the numerator isn't zero at either of these points, both x = -2 and x = 7 are vertical asymptotes. So, a and b are -2 and 7. Wait, but the problem says \"asymptotes vertically x = a and x = b,\" so a and b are the roots we found. So, a = -2 and b = 7? Or is there a different order? Probably, they could be in any order, but when they ask for a + b + c, the order might not matter because addition is commutative. So, let's note that a and b are -2 and 7. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes of rational functions depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is degree 1 (2x), and the denominator is degree 2 (x² -5x -14). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, is that right? Let me recall: if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they are equal, it's the leading coefficients. If the numerator is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote but an oblique one. So, yes, in this case, since the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nSo, a = -2, b = 7, c = 0. Therefore, a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, factoring the denominator: x² -5x -14. The factors of -14 that add to -5 are 2 and -7. So, (x + 2)(x - 7) is correct. Then, setting each factor equal to zero gives x = -2 and x = 7. Since the numerator at these points is non-zero, those are indeed vertical asymptotes. Then, horizontal asymptote: since the denominator is degree 2 and numerator is degree 1, horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, adding them up: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem specifies the order of a and b. It says \"asymptotes vertically x = a and x = b\". So, they might be in the order from left to right? So, x = -2 and x = 7, so a = -2 and b =7. Then, c =0. Therefore, a + b + c = -2 +7 +0 =5. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want them in some other order? But since they are vertical asymptotes, the order shouldn't matter for the sum. So, the answer should be 5. Hmm, seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me check once again. Maybe I miscalculated something. Let's verify the vertical asymptotes once more. The denominator factors to (x + 2)(x -7). So, roots at x = -2 and x =7. Correct. The numerator is 2x, so at x = -2, numerator is -4, not zero; at x =7, numerator is 14, also not zero. So, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7. So, a and b are -2 and7. Then, horizontal asymptote is y=0. Therefore, sum is -2 +7 +0=5. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a different kind of asymptote, but no, they specified vertical and horizontal. So, yeah, 5 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\):\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) factors to \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n   - The roots of the denominator are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Since the numerator \\( 2x \\) is not zero at these points, the vertical asymptotes are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:\n   - The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2).\n   - Hence, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Sum of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)**:\n   - Adding these values: \\( a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]", "answer": "5"}

Hmm, that's 99² + 99 + 1. Hmm, I wonder if there's a trick here instead of just doing each term step by step. Let me think... \n\nFirst, I know that 99 squared is a common calculation, but maybe there's a way to factor or simplify this expression. Let me write it down again: 99² + 99 + 1. If I factor out a 99 from the first two terms, that would be 99(99 + 1) + 1. Let's check that. 99 times (99 + 1) is 99*100, which is 9900. Then add 1, so 9900 + 1 is 9901.

For example, sometimes expressions like x² + x + 1 come up in geometric sequences or other contexts. Wait, another thought: 99 is close to 100. Maybe there's a way to express 99 in terms of 100 - 1. Let's see. Let me try that. So 99 = 100 - 1. Then 99² would be (100 - 1)². Let's expand that. (100 - 1)² = 100² - 2*100*1 + 1² = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. Then 99² + 99 + 1 is 9801 + 99 + 1. Let me add those numbers step by step. 9801 + 99 is 9900, and then 9900 + 1 is 9901. So that gives the same result as before. \n\nWait, so both methods lead to 9901. That seems consistent. Let me check with another approach just to be sure. Maybe compute each term individually. 99 squared: 99*99. Let's compute that. 100*100 is 10,000. Subtract 100 + 99, which is 199. So 10,000 - 199 = 9801. So 99² is 9801. Then add 99: 9801 + 99. Let's see, 9801 + 100 is 9901, then subtract 1 to get 9801 + 99 = 9900 - 1? Wait, no. Wait, 9801 + 99. 9801 + 100 is 9901, so subtract 1 gives 9900? Wait, no. Wait, 9801 + 99 is 9801 + (100 - 1) = 9901 - 1 = 9900. Then add 1: 9900 + 1 = 9901. So that works out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a clever algebraic identity. Let's think. If I have x² + x + 1, and if I multiply by (x - 1), I get x³ - 1. Because (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = x³ - 1. So maybe if I set x = 99, then (99 - 1)(99² + 99 + 1) = 99³ - 1. But I don't know if that helps here. Let me compute 99³ - 1 and see if that relates. \n\nBut 99³ is 99*99*99. Let's compute that. First, 99*99 = 9801 as before. Then 9801*99. Let me compute that. 9801*100 = 980,100, subtract 9801 to get 980,100 - 9,801 = 970,299. So 99³ is 970,299. Then 99³ - 1 is 970,298. But how does that relate to our original expression? Wait, (99 - 1)(original expression) = 970,298. But 99 - 1 is 98. So 98*(original expression) = 970,298. Therefore, original expression is 970,298 / 98. Let's compute that. 970,298 divided by 98. \n\nHmm, 98*9,900 = 98*10,000 - 98*100 = 980,000 - 9,800 = 970,200. Then 970,298 - 970,200 = 98. So 970,298 / 98 = 9,900 + 1 = 9,901. So that gives us 9,901. Which matches the previous results. So that's another way to get to the same answer. \n\nSo through multiple methods: factoring, direct expansion, and even using the identity involving x³ - 1, we end up with 9,901. Therefore, the answer should be 9901. \n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me verify once more. Let's compute each term step by step without any shortcuts. \n\nFirst, 99 squared. 99*99. Let's compute this:\n\n99\nx99\n-----\nFirst multiply 99 by 9: 891\nThen multiply 99 by 90: 8910\nAdd them together: 891 + 8910 = 9801. So 99² = 9801. \n\nThen add 99: 9801 + 99. Let's compute that. 9801 + 99. Since 9801 + 100 = 9901, subtract 1 gives 9900. Wait, 9801 + 99 is 9801 + (100 - 1) = 9901 - 1 = 9900. Wait, no. Wait, 9801 + 99: 9801 + 100 is 9901, so subtract 1 to get 9900. Then add 1: 9900 + 1 = 9901. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 99² + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9901. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 99 + 1 first, which is 100, then add to 99². So 99² + 100. 99² is 9801, so 9801 + 100 = 9901. Then we have already added 100 instead of 99, so we need to subtract 1. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 99² + 99 + 1. If I group 99² + (99 + 1), that's 99² + 100. 99² is 9801, so 9801 + 100 = 9901. Then, no need to subtract anything because we already added 99 + 1. Wait, but 99 + 1 is 100, so adding that to 99² gives 9901. So that's another way to see it. \n\nYes, so 99² + 99 + 1 = 99² + (99 + 1) = 99² + 100 = 9801 + 100 = 9901. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 9901. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning. All approaches converge to the same result. So I'm confident the answer is 9901.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(99^2 + 99 + 1\\), we can use algebraic manipulation or direct computation:\n\n1. **Algebraic Insight**:\n   - Recognize that \\(99 = 100 - 1\\).\n   - Expand \\(99^2\\) using the binomial formula: \\((100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(9801 + 99 + 1\\).\n   - Simplify step-by-step: \\(9801 + 99 = 9900\\), then \\(9900 + 1 = 9901\\).\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - Direct computation: \\(99^2 = 9801\\).\n   - Add \\(99\\) and \\(1\\): \\(9801 + 99 + 1 = 9901\\).\n\nBoth methods confirm the result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9901}\n\\]", "answer": "9901"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem is about operator norms, right? The operator norm of a matrix is the smallest C such that the inequality ||A v|| ≤ C ||v|| holds for all vectors v. So, essentially, I need to compute the operator norm of the given matrix. But how exactly do you compute that?\n\nI remember that for a matrix A, the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm (which is the default here) is equal to the largest singular value of A. And the singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of A^T A. Alternatively, it's the square roots of the eigenvalues of A^* A for complex matrices, but since this is a real matrix, it's the same. So maybe I can compute the singular values of the given matrix.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the operator norm is the maximum of ||A v|| / ||v|| over all non-zero vectors v. So, the maximum value of the ratio of the norm of A v to the norm of v. Therefore, the minimal C is the maximum of this ratio over all possible v, which would correspond to the singular value.\n\nBut maybe I can compute it step by step. Let me try both approaches and see which one works better.\n\nFirst, let's recall the matrix:\n\nA = [2   3]\n      [0  -2]\n\nSo, this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me first compute A^T A. Since A is real, A^T is just the transpose of A.\n\nA^T = [2   0]\n       [3  -2]\n\nSo, A^T A is:\n\n[2*2 + 0*0, 2*3 + 0*(-2)]\n[3*2 + (-2)*0, 3*3 + (-2)*(-2)]\n\nWait, let me compute that properly.\n\nFirst entry: (2)(2) + (0)(0) = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSecond entry: (2)(3) + (0)(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nThird entry: (3)(2) + (-2)(0) = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nFourth entry: (3)(3) + (-2)(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nSo, A^T A = [4   6]\n           [6  13]\n\nNow, to find the eigenvalues of A^T A, which will give me the squares of the singular values. Then, take the square roots of the maximum eigenvalue to get the operator norm.\n\nSo, let's compute the eigenvalues of [4   6; 6  13]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(A^T A - λ I) = 0.\n\nSo, determinant of:\n\n[4 - λ   6      ]\n[6       13 - λ ]\n\nWhich is (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - (6)(6) = 0.\n\nCompute (4 - λ)(13 - λ) = (4)(13) - 4λ -13λ + λ^2 = 52 - 17λ + λ^2\n\nSubtract 36 (since 6*6=36):\n\nSo, 52 - 17λ + λ^2 - 36 = 16 -17λ + λ^2 = 0\n\nSo the quadratic equation is λ^2 -17λ +16 =0.\n\nSolving for λ:\n\nλ = [17 ± sqrt(17^2 - 4*1*16)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant: 289 - 64 = 225\n\nsqrt(225) =15\n\nThus, λ = [17 ±15]/2\n\nSo, λ1 = (17 +15)/2 =32/2=16\n\nλ2=(17 -15)/2=2/2=1\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of A^T A are 16 and 1. Therefore, the singular values of A are sqrt(16)=4 and sqrt(1)=1.\n\nTherefore, the operator norm is the largest singular value, which is 4. Therefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the operator norm is the maximum of ||A v|| / ||v|| over all v ≠0. Let's try to maximize this ratio.\n\nLet me consider a vector v = [x; y]. Then, A v = [2x + 3y; -2y]\n\nThen, ||A v||^2 = (2x +3y)^2 + (-2y)^2 = (4x^2 +12xy +9y^2) +4y^2 =4x^2 +12xy +13y^2\n\n||v||^2 =x^2 + y^2\n\nSo, the ratio squared is (4x^2 +12xy +13y^2)/(x^2 + y^2). To maximize this ratio, we can set it up as a function f(x,y) = (4x^2 +12xy +13y^2)/(x^2 + y^2). To find the maximum, we can use Lagrange multipliers or parametrize with polar coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, set y = kx, then express in terms of k.\n\nLet me try that. Let y = kx. Then, since x and y are variables, we can let x =1 (since the ratio is homogeneous of degree 0), so y =k.\n\nSo, substitute into f(1, k):\n\n(4(1)^2 +12(1)(k) +13(k)^2)/(1^2 + k^2) = (4 +12k +13k^2)/(1 +k^2)\n\nLet’s denote this as f(k) = (13k^2 +12k +4)/(k^2 +1). To find the maximum of f(k), take derivative with respect to k and set to zero.\n\nCompute f'(k) = [(26k +12)(k^2 +1) - (13k^2 +12k +4)(2k)] / (k^2 +1)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(26k +12)(k^2 +1) - 2k(13k^2 +12k +4)\n\nFirst term: 26k*(k^2) +26k*1 +12*k^2 +12*1 =26k^3 +26k +12k^2 +12\n\nSecond term: 2k*(13k^2) +2k*(12k) +2k*4=26k^3 +24k^2 +8k\n\nSubtract the second term from the first term:\n\n[26k^3 +26k +12k^2 +12] - [26k^3 +24k^2 +8k] = (26k^3 -26k^3) + (12k^2 -24k^2) + (26k -8k) +12\n\n= 0 -12k^2 +18k +12\n\nThus, numerator is -12k^2 +18k +12. Set this equal to zero:\n\n-12k^2 +18k +12 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n12k^2 -18k -12 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n2k^2 -3k -2 =0\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk = [3 ± sqrt(9 +16)] /4 = [3 ± sqrt(25)] /4 = [3 ±5]/4\n\nSo, k1=(3+5)/4=8/4=2, k2=(3-5)/4=(-2)/4=-0.5\n\nSo critical points at k=2 and k=-0.5.\n\nNow evaluate f(k) at these points:\n\nFirst, k=2:\n\nf(2) = (13*(4) +12*2 +4)/(4 +1) = (52 +24 +4)/5 =80/5=16\n\nSecond, k=-0.5:\n\nf(-0.5)= (13*(0.25) +12*(-0.5)+4)/(0.25 +1)= (3.25 -6 +4)/1.25= (1.25)/1.25=1\n\nAlso, check the behavior as k approaches infinity. As k→∞, f(k)= (13k^2 +12k +4)/(k^2 +1) ≈13k^2/k^2=13. So the limit is 13. So the maximum occurs at k=2 with value 16, and another critical point at k=-0.5 with value 1, and the limit at infinity is 13.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of f(k) is 16, so the maximum ratio ||A v|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4. So that confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using another method. For example, using the fact that the operator norm is the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the matrix, but since this is a non-symmetric matrix, eigenvalues don't directly relate. Wait, but actually, for the operator norm, it's the largest singular value, which is the square root of the eigenvalue of A^T A, which we already computed as 4. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the maximum of ||A v|| over all v with ||v||=1. Then the maximum is the operator norm. So, we need to maximize ||A v|| where ||v||=1.\n\nExpressed as maximizing sqrt(4x^2 +12xy +13y^2) subject to x^2 + y^2 =1.\n\nThis is equivalent to maximizing 4x^2 +12xy +13y^2. Let me denote this quadratic form. Let’s write it as [x y] [4   6; 6 13] [x; y]. Which is exactly the same as the eigenvalue problem we had before. So again, the maximum value of this quadratic form over the unit circle is the largest eigenvalue of A^T A, which is 16, so the maximum sqrt(16)=4.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 4. So the minimal C is 4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with a specific vector. For example, take v such that y =2x (since k=2). Let me set x=1, y=2. Then v= [1; 2]. Compute A v:\n\n[2*1 +3*2; 0*1 + (-2)*2] = [2 +6; 0 -4] = [8; -4]. The norm is sqrt(8^2 + (-4)^2)=sqrt(64 +16)=sqrt(80)=4*sqrt(5). The norm of v is sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So the ratio is 4*sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)=4. So that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, take another vector. Let's take the singular vector corresponding to the singular value 4. Since in A^T A, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1, the singular vectors are the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 16.\n\nFrom A^T A -16 I = [4-16  6; 6 13-16] = [-12 6; 6 -3]\n\nSo, the equation is -12x +6y =0, and 6x -3y=0. Both equations reduce to 2x - y =0, so y=2x. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1; 2], which is the same vector as before. So when we apply A to this vector, we get a vector of norm 4 times the original norm, hence the ratio 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector would satisfy A^T A v = v, so (A^T A -I)v=0. Then, [3 6;6 12]v=0, which gives 3x +6y=0 => x= -2y. So eigenvector is [ -2;1], and applying A to this vector:\n\n[2*(-2) +3*1; 0*(-2) + (-2)*1] = [ -4 +3; 0 -2 ] = [ -1; -2 ]. The norm is sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5), and the norm of the original vector is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So the ratio is 1, which matches the singular value 1.\n\nTherefore, all checks out. So the minimal C is indeed 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest real positive number \\( C \\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest real positive number \\( C \\) such that \n\\[\n\\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\bold{v} \\right\\| \\le C \\|\\bold{v}\\|\n\\]\nfor all two-dimensional vectors \\(\\bold{v}\\), we need to determine the operator norm of the given matrix.

{"original_question": "Quel est $1^{(2^{235423523})}$ ?", "question": "Quel est $1^{(2^{235423523})}$ ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what 1 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of 235423523 is. Let me start by breaking down the expression. The problem is written as 1^(2^(235423523)). That means I have to compute 2 raised to the power of 235423523 first, and then take 1 to that result as the exponent. \n\nWait, hold on. Exponents are read from the top down, right? So 2^(235423523) is a tower of exponents, but here it's written as 2 raised to that big number. Then 1 raised to that huge exponent. But I remember that any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. Because 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is still 1. So regardless of what the exponent is, 1 to the power of anything is 1. \n\nLet me verify this with some smaller exponents to make sure. For example, 1^2 is 1, right? 1^3 is 1, 1^4 is 1, and so on. Even if the exponent is a million, 1^1,000,000 is still 1. So even if the exponent is something like 2^10, which is 1024, 1^1024 is still 1. Therefore, even if the exponent is another exponent tower, like 2^(235423523), raising 1 to that power would still result in 1. \n\nSo even though 2^(235423523) is an enormous number—maybe too big to compute directly—it doesn't matter because the base is 1. The result will always be 1. \n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a case where 1 raised to an exponent isn't 1? Well, if the exponent is 0, then 1^0 is 1 as well. If the exponent is negative, 1^(-n) is 1, because 1 divided by 1 multiple times is still 1. But in this problem, the exponent is definitely a positive integer, right? Because 2 raised to any positive integer is positive, and 235423523 is a positive integer. So the exponent here is a huge positive integer, but even so, 1 raised to that is still 1. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the size of the exponent, as long as the base is 1, the result is 1. So the answer should be 1. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check once more with another example. Suppose I have 1^(5^(3^2)). Let's compute that. First, compute the innermost exponent: 3^2 is 9. Then 5^9 is 1953125. Then 1 raised to that power is still 1. Yep, that works. So even with multiple layers, it's still 1. \n\nSo applying the same logic, 1^(2^(235423523)) is just 1. The exponent, even though it's a massive number, doesn't change the base of 1. Therefore, the answer is 1. \n\nI don't see any exceptions or special cases here. The properties of exponents tell us that 1 raised to any real number is 1. Since the exponent here is a real number (specifically, a positive integer), the result holds. \n\nSo, after all this thinking and checking, I'm confident that the answer is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\) is determined by the base and the exponent. Any number raised to any power remains \\(1\\) if the base is \\(1\\).

So, we have a complex number z such that z^5 = 1 and z ≠ 1. We need to calculate the expression z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Hmm, complex numbers and roots of unity. Alright, let's start by recalling that the solutions to z^5 = 1 are the 5th roots of unity. Since z ≠ 1, we're dealing with the primitive 5th roots of unity. \n\nFirst, the 5th roots of unity are given by e^(2πik/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Since z ≠ 1, we can take k = 1, 2, 3, 4. Now, these roots have the property that z^5 = 1, so z^5 - 1 = 0. Factoring this, we get (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1) = 0. Since z ≠ 1, it must satisfy the equation z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0. That's useful information.\n\nNow, the expression we need to compute is z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Let me see if I can manipulate this expression using the equation we have. Let's denote S = z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Maybe if I can relate S to the equation z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0. Let's see. If I multiply both sides of S by z², perhaps? Let's try that.\n\nMultiplying S by z²: z³ + z + z⁴ + z². Then, z^4 + z^3 + z² + z = 0 (from the equation above). So, z^4 + z^3 + z² + z = 0. Therefore, multiplying S by z² gives us 0. Wait, so z² * S = 0. Therefore, z² * S = 0. But z² is not zero because z is a root of unity and hence non-zero. Therefore, S must be zero? Wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, let's check that again. If S = z + 1/z + z² + 1/z², then z² * S = z³ + z + z⁴ + z². But since z^4 + z³ + z² + z + 1 = 0, then z^4 + z³ + z² + z = -1. Therefore, z² * S = (z^4 + z³ + z² + z) + z² = (-1) + z². Wait, hold on, that seems different from my initial thought. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, z² * S = z²(z + 1/z + z² + 1/z²) = z³ + z + z⁴ + z². But from the equation z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0, we can rearrange to z^4 + z^3 + z² + z = -1. Therefore, z² * S = (z^4 + z^3 + z² + z) + z² = (-1) + z². Wait, but that would mean z² * S = -1 + z². Hmm, but this isn't zero unless z² = 1, which it isn't. So my previous conclusion was wrong. So maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that z^5 = 1, so 1/z = z^4, 1/z² = z^3, since z^5 = 1 implies z^k = z^(k mod 5). So 1/z = z^4, 1/z² = z^3. Therefore, the expression S becomes z + z^4 + z² + z^3. But from the equation z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0, we can substitute S here. Since z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. Therefore, S = -1. Wait, so is the answer -1?\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify. Since z is a root of z^4 + z^3 + z² + z + 1 = 0, then z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. Therefore, substituting back into S, which is z + z⁴ + z² + z³, that's exactly the same as the left-hand side, so S = -1. Therefore, the answer is -1. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let's check with a specific root. Let's take z = e^(2πi/5). Then, z + 1/z + z² + 1/z² = e^(2πi/5) + e^(-2πi/5) + e^(4πi/5) + e^(-4πi/5). This is equal to 2cos(2π/5) + 2cos(4π/5). Let's compute this numerically. Cos(2π/5) is approximately 0.3090, and cos(4π/5) is approximately -0.8090. So 2*0.3090 + 2*(-0.8090) = 0.618 - 1.618 = -1. So yes, numerically, it is -1. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-1}.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake in the reasoning. The key step was recognizing that 1/z = z^4 and 1/z² = z^3 because z^5 = 1. Then substituting into S gives z + z^4 + z² + z³, which is exactly the sum from the equation z^4 + z³ + z² + z + 1 = 0, except with a missing 1. Therefore, S = -1. That seems correct. So, the answer is indeed -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\( z \\) such that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we need to calculate the expression \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\).\n\nFirst, we note that the 5th roots of unity satisfy the equation \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\). Factoring this, we get:\n\\[\n(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\n\\]\nSince \\( z \\neq 1 \\), it must satisfy the equation:\n\\[\nz^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the given expression \\( S = z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Using the property \\( z^5 = 1 \\), we know that \\( \\frac{1}{z} = z^4 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:\n\\[\nS = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3\n\\]\n\nFrom the equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), we can rearrange it to:\n\\[\nz^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1\n\\]\n\nThus, substituting this into our expression for \\( S \\), we find:\n\\[\nS = -1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]", "answer": "-1"}

Hmm, let me think. Alright, first, I remember that when subtracting numbers in a different base, it's similar to subtracting in base 10, but I have to remember that each digit represents a power of 9 instead of 10. So, the rightmost digit is 9^0, which is 1, then the next is 9^1, which is 9, and so on. \n\nLet me write down the numbers to visualize:\n\n      5 8 (base 9)\n    - 1 8 (base 9)\n    -----------\n      ? ? (base 9)\n\nSo, subtracting the units place first: 8 base 9 minus 8 base 9. Wait, 8 in base 9 is just 8 in decimal, right? Because 8 is less than 9, so there's no need to borrow. So 8 - 8 = 0. So the units digit of the result is 0.\n\nNow moving to the next digit (the 9's place): 5 base 9 minus 1 base 9. That's straightforward too. 5 - 1 = 4. So the 9's place in the result is 4. Therefore, putting it all together, the result is 40 base 9. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should convert both numbers to base 10, subtract them, and then convert back to base 9 to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 58 base 9. In base 10, that would be 5*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 5*9 + 8*1 = 45 + 8 = 53.\n\nThen 18 base 9 is 1*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSubtracting in base 10: 53 - 17 = 36.\n\nNow, converting 36 back to base 9. Let's see, 9^2 is 81, which is larger than 36, so the highest power needed is 9^1. \n\n36 divided by 9 is 4, with a remainder of 0. So 4*9^1 + 0*9^0, which is 40 in base 9. \n\nSo that matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the answer is 40 base 9. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me go through the subtraction again in base 9 without converting. \n\nStarting with the rightmost digit: 8_9 - 8_9. As before, that's 0. Then the left digit: 5_9 - 1_9. That's 4_9. So the result is 40_9. Yep, same as before. \n\nI think that's solid. Maybe another way to check is by adding 40_9 and 18_9 to see if we get 58_9. Let's try that.\n\n40 base 9 + 18 base 9. \n\nAdd the units digits: 0 + 8 = 8_9. Then the 9's place: 4 + 1 = 5_9. So the sum is 58_9, which matches the original problem. That confirms that 40_9 - 18_9 = 58_9? Wait, no, actually, in subtraction, if we add the subtrahend (18) to the difference (40), we should get the minuend (58). So 40 + 18 = 58, which is correct. So that's another check. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 40 base 9. \n\nBut let me just think if there's any other way this could have gone wrong. For example, if there was a borrow involved. In the units place, we had 8_9 - 8_9. Since both digits are the same, we didn't need to borrow. If the subtrahend digit was larger, we would have to borrow from the next higher place. For example, if it was 8_9 - 9_9, then we would need to borrow 1 from the 9's place, making it 1_9 (since 9 in base 9 is 10 base 9, so borrowing 1 would add 9 to the current digit). But in this case, both digits are the same, so no borrowing is needed. \n\nTherefore, the subtraction is straightforward here. Both digits in the subtrahend (18 base 9) are less than or equal to the corresponding digits in the minuend (58 base 9), so no borrowing occurs. \n\nHence, the result is 40 base 9. \n\nAnother thing to check: sometimes when subtracting in different bases, people might confuse the base conversion. But since we did the subtraction in base 9 and confirmed it by converting to base 10 and back, it's solid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some might think that in base 9, the digits go up to 8, which they do, so 58 base 9 is 5*9 +8 =53, which is correct. So all the steps check out. \n\nSo I think that's it. The answer is 40 in base 9. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{40_9}\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) and express the result in base 9, we start by subtracting the digits in each place value without converting to base 10 initially.\n\n1. Subtract the units place: \\(8_9 - 8_9 = 0_9\\).\n2. Subtract the 9's place: \\(5_9 - 1_9 = 4_9\\).\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(40_9\\).\n\nTo verify, we convert both numbers to base 10:\n- \\(58_9\\) in base 10 is \\(5 \\times 9 + 8 = 53\\).\n- \\(18_9\\) in base 10 is \\(1 \\times 9 + 8 = 17\\).\n\nSubtracting in base 10: \\(53 - 17 = 36\\).\n\nConverting 36 back to base 9:\n- \\(36 \\div 9 = 4\\) with a remainder of 0, so \\(36_{10} = 40_9\\).\n\nAdding \\(40_9\\) and \\(18_9\\) confirms the result:\n- Units place: \\(0_9 + 8_9 = 8_9\\).\n- 9's place: \\(4_9 + 1_9 = 5_9\\).\n\nThus, the final result is \\(\\boxed{40_9}\\).", "answer": "40_9"}

Hmm, let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities. I remember that \\(\\sec x\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\cos x\\), right? So \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). Maybe substituting that in will help simplify things.\n\nLet me rewrite the first term using the identity. So, \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\). Dividing by \\(\\cos x\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1/\\cos x\\), so maybe this can be written as \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). Let me check that again. Yes, because \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) divided by \\(\\sin x\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). Okay, so the first term simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n\nNow, the second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). That's straightforward; maybe I can leave it as it is for now. So the entire expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor out something here. Both terms have a \\(\\cos x\\) in the denominator. Let's see. The first term is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\) and the second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). If I factor out \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\), then the first term would be \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\) and the second term would be \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\sin x\\). So factoring out \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x \\right )\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems like a good step. Let me verify that. Yes, factoring \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) from both terms would leave \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x\\) inside the parentheses. That's correct.\n\nNow, let's look at what's inside the parentheses: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\sin x\\). To combine these terms, I can write them with a common denominator. The common denominator would be \\(\\sin x\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\).\n\nWait, that's a key point. \\(1 - \\sin^2 x\\) is one of the Pythagorean identities, right? It equals \\(\\cos^2 x\\). So substituting that in, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, putting it all back together, the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x}\\) gives \\(\\cos x\\), so the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\) is the cotangent of x, which is written as \\(\\cot x\\). So the simplified form of the original expression is \\(\\cot x\\).\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), converted \\(\\sec x\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\), which is correct. Then, expressed both terms over \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\) by factoring out \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\), leading to \\(\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\sin x}\\), which is \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin x}\\), multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) gives \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\), which is indeed \\(\\cot x\\). \n\nHmm, let me verify once more by plugging in a value for x. Let's take x = 45 degrees, where \\(\\sin 45 = \\cos 45 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), and \\(\\sec 45 = \\sqrt{2}\\). \n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}/2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2}\\). Simplify each term: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}/2} = 2\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2} = 1\\). So the expression is 2 - 1 = 1. \n\nNow, \\(\\cot 45\\) is also 1, since \\(\\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\), and both are \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) over \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), which is 1. So that checks out. \n\nAnother test: x = 30 degrees. Then, \\(\\sin 30 = 1/2\\), \\(\\cos 30 = \\sqrt{3}/2\\), \\(\\sec 30 = 2/\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{2/\\sqrt{3}}{1/2} - \\frac{1/2}{\\sqrt{3}/2}\\). Compute each term: first term is \\(\\frac{2/\\sqrt{3}}{1/2} = 4/\\sqrt{3}\\), second term is \\(\\frac{1/2}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).

I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the test cases confirm that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original one. So the answer should be \\(\\boxed{\\cot x}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\cot x}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), we start by using the identity \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\).

The problem says that the product of two quadratic polynomials, 3t² + 5t + a and 4t² + bt - 2, is equal to another quartic polynomial: 12t⁴ + 26t³ - 8t² -16t +6. My job is to figure out what a and b are, right? Then add them together for the answer. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are both quadratics, it's going to be a bit more involved. Each term in the first polynomial has to be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nSo, the first polynomial is 3t² + 5t + a, and the second one is 4t² + bt - 2. Let me denote them as follows:\n\nFirst polynomial: P(t) = 3t² + 5t + a\n\nSecond polynomial: Q(t) = 4t² + bt - 2\n\nTheir product is given as R(t) = 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6\n\nSo, P(t) * Q(t) = R(t). To find a and b, I need to multiply P(t) and Q(t) and then compare the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with R(t). That makes sense because if two polynomials are equal for all values of t, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. \n\nAlright, let's perform the multiplication. Let me write out each term:\n\nFirst, multiply 3t² by each term in Q(t):\n\n3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴\n\n3t² * bt = 3b t³\n\n3t² * (-2) = -6t²\n\nNext, multiply 5t by each term in Q(t):\n\n5t * 4t² = 20t³\n\n5t * bt = 5b t²\n\n5t * (-2) = -10t\n\nThen, multiply a by each term in Q(t):\n\na * 4t² = 4a t²\n\na * bt = ab t\n\na * (-2) = -2a\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms together:\n\n12t⁴ + 3b t³ -6t² + 20t³ + 5b t² -10t +4a t² + ab t -2a\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of t.\n\nStarting with the highest degree, which is t⁴:\n\n12t⁴\n\nThen t³ terms:\n\n3b t³ + 20t³ = (3b + 20) t³\n\nThen t² terms:\n\n-6t² +5b t² +4a t² = (-6 +5b +4a) t²\n\nThen t terms:\n\n-10t + ab t = (-10 + ab) t\n\nConstant term:\n\n-2a\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product polynomial is:\n\n12t⁴ + (3b + 20) t³ + (-6 +5b +4a) t² + (-10 + ab) t -2a\n\nNow, this should be equal to the given polynomial R(t):\n\n12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of t.\n\nStarting with the t⁴ term:\n\n12 = 12. Well, that's already matching. So no problem here.\n\nNext, t³ term:\n\n3b +20 =26\n\nSo, solving for b:\n\n3b =26 -20 =6\n\nTherefore, b=6/3=2\n\nOkay, so b=2.\n\nNow, moving on to the t² term:\n\n-6 +5b +4a = -8\n\nWe already know that b=2, so substitute that in:\n\n-6 +5*(2) +4a = -8\n\nCalculate 5*2=10\n\nSo:\n\n-6 +10 +4a = -8\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 +4a = -8\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n4a = -8 -4 = -12\n\nTherefore, a= -12 /4= -3\n\nSo, a= -3.\n\nNext, check the t term:\n\n-10 +ab = -16\n\nAgain, substitute a= -3 and b=2:\n\n-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16\n\nWhich matches the coefficient in R(t). Good.\n\nFinally, the constant term:\n\n-2a =6\n\nSubstitute a= -3:\n\n-2*(-3)=6\n\nWhich is 6=6. That also checks out. Perfect, so all coefficients match. So, our values of a= -3 and b=2 are correct.\n\nTherefore, a + b = -3 +2= -1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, multiplication steps:\n\n3t²*4t²=12t⁴, correct.\n\n3t²*bt=3bt³, correct.\n\n3t²*(-2)= -6t², correct.\n\n5t*4t²=20t³, correct.\n\n5t*bt=5bt², correct.\n\n5t*(-2)= -10t, correct.\n\na*4t²=4a t², correct.\n\na*bt=abt, correct.\n\na*(-2)= -2a, correct.\n\nThen combining like terms:\n\nt⁴:12t⁴, correct.\n\nt³:3bt³ +20t³=(3b +20)t³, correct.\n\nt²:-6t² +5bt² +4a t²=(-6 +5b +4a)t², correct.\n\nt terms: -10t +abt=(-10 +ab)t, correct.\n\nconstants: -2a, correct.\n\nSetting coefficients equal:\n\nt³:3b +20=26 =>3b=6 =>b=2, correct.\n\nt²:-6 +5*2 +4a=-8 =>-6 +10 +4a=-8 =>4 +4a=-8 =>4a=-12 =>a=-3, correct.\n\nt term:-10 +a*b=-10 +(-3)(2)=-10 -6=-16, which matches, correct.\n\nconstants:-2a=6 =>a=-3, correct.\n\nAll steps check out. So, a=-3, b=2. Therefore, a + b= -3 +2= -1.\n\nBut wait, the problem is in French. Let me just confirm that I didn't misread anything.

The problem says it's being filled at a rate of 20π cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at 4 meters per hour. Hmm, so when they say the level is rising, that relates to the volume increasing over time, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, since the reservoir is being filled, the volume is increasing with time. The rate at which the volume is increasing is 20π m³/h. \n\nBut the problem also mentions that the water level (which is the height h) is rising at 4 meters per hour. So, dh/dt = 4 m/h. Wait, calculus might be involved here. Since we're dealing with rates of change, I should probably use related rates. \n\nLet me recall. If V = πr²h, then the rate of change of volume with respect to time is dV/dt = πr² dh/dt. We know dV/dt is 20π and dh/dt is 4. So plugging those in:\n\n20π = πr² * 4\n\nOkay, let's solve for r. First, I can divide both sides by π to cancel that out:\n\n20 = r² * 4\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n\nr² = 20 / 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nr² = 5\n\nSo, the radius r is the square root of 5. Since they want the simplest radical form, that would be √5 meters. \n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nVolume rate is 20π m³/h. The rate of height increase is 4 m/h. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. Taking derivative with respect to time, dV/dt = πr² dh/dt. So substituting the known values:\n\n20π = πr² * 4\n\nDivide both sides by π: 20 = 4r²\n\nDivide by 4: 5 = r²\n\nSo r = √5. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nIs there any other detail I might have missed? The problem mentions it's a right circular cylinder, which I think is just standard. The units are in meters, and the answer should be in meters. The question specifies to put the answer in the simplest radical form, which √5 already is. \n\nI think that's all. The key was recognizing that the rate of volume increase is related to the rate of height increase through the formula involving the radius. Since the radius isn't changing with time, it's a constant, so we can solve for it straightforwardly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of the reservoir is \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}} meters.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the radius of a cylindrical reservoir that is being filled with water at a rate of \\(20\\pi\\) cubic meters per hour, with the water level rising at 4 meters per hour. \n\nGiven:\n- The rate of volume increase, \\(\\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{h}\\)\n- The rate of height increase, \\(\\frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \\, \\text{m/h}\\)\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\).

So, we have a piecewise function f(x) defined as ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. We need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, interesting. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the function. The function has two parts: one is a quadratic part for x ≥ a, and the other is a linear part for x < a. Since a is a parameter, the shape and the point where the function switches (at x = a) will depend on the value of a. The goal is to ensure that no matter what horizontal line we draw (like y = k for any real number k), the graph of f(x) will cross it at least once. So, we need to find the maximum a where this condition holds.\n\nLet me break it down. For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, both parts of the function must cover all possible y-values. However, since the quadratic part is a parabola opening upwards (assuming a is positive) or downwards (if a is negative), and the linear part is a straight line, their combination might have limitations. \n\nWait, but the coefficient a affects both the quadratic and linear parts. So, if a is positive, the quadratic part (ax²) is upward-opening, and the linear part (ax + 2a) is increasing. If a is negative, the quadratic part is downward-opening, and the linear part is decreasing. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether a is positive or negative, so we need to consider both cases. But maybe we can figure out the direction based on the problem's requirements.\n\nThe key is that the entire graph must cover all real numbers y. But since the quadratic part is either a parabola or a downward-opening curve, it might have a maximum or minimum. If a is positive, the quadratic part has a minimum at x = a (since the vertex of ax² is at x = 0, but here the function switches at x = a). Wait, no. Wait, actually, the quadratic part is ax², so its vertex is at x = 0, but the function switches at x = a. So, the quadratic part is only defined for x ≥ a. Therefore, if a is positive, then x ≥ a is part of the domain where x is already greater than a, so the quadratic part is increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of a. Wait, if a is positive, then ax² is a parabola opening upwards, so for x ≥ a, as x increases, ax² increases. If a is negative, then ax² is a downward-opening parabola, so for x ≥ a (which is negative), as x increases, ax² would decrease because squaring a negative number makes it positive, but multiplying by a negative a would make it negative again. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each piece of the function separately.\n\n1. For x ≥ a: f(x) = ax². This is a parabola. If a > 0, it opens upwards, with vertex at (0, 0). But since it's only defined for x ≥ a, the portion of the parabola we're considering starts at x = a. So, if a > 0, the minimum value of this parabola on x ≥ a is at x = a, which is a*(a)^2 = a³. Then, as x increases beyond a, the value of f(x) increases without bound. So, for a > 0, the quadratic part contributes a minimum at y = a³ and goes to infinity as x increases.\n\n2. For x < a: f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a linear function. If a > 0, the line has a positive slope, so as x approaches a from the left, the value approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For x approaching negative infinity, the value of the line goes to negative infinity. If a < 0, the line has a negative slope, so as x approaches a from the left, the value approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For x approaching negative infinity, the value goes to positive infinity. \n\nSo, when a is positive, the linear part (for x < a) is increasing from negative infinity up to a² + 2a at x = a. The quadratic part (for x ≥ a) is increasing from a³ upwards. Therefore, the entire graph for a > 0 would consist of a line increasing from negative infinity to a² + 2a, and then a parabola increasing from a³ onwards. So, the combined graph would have a minimum value at y = a³. But wait, the linear part might have a higher value at x = a. Let's check.\n\nWait, at x = a, the quadratic part is f(a) = a*(a)^2 = a³. The linear part, as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, if a³ < a² + 2a, then the linear part is above the quadratic part at x = a. Otherwise, they meet at that point. Let's solve when a³ = a² + 2a.\n\na³ - a² - 2a = 0\n\na(a² - a - 2) = 0\n\na(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\n\nSolutions are a = 0, a = 2, a = -1.\n\nBut since we are considering a > 0, the relevant solutions are a = 0 and a = 2. So, when a = 2, the linear and quadratic parts meet at x = 2. For a < 2, the quadratic part at x = a is lower than the linear part approaching from the left, so there's a gap between the two parts. Wait, actually, when a is positive and less than 2, the quadratic part at x = a is a³, and the linear part as x approaches a from the left is a² + 2a. Let's compare a³ and a² + 2a for 0 < a < 2.\n\nTake a = 1: a³ = 1, a² + 2a = 1 + 2 = 3. So, 1 < 3. So, the linear part is higher at x = a. For a approaching 0 from the right, a³ approaches 0 and a² + 2a approaches 0 as well, but the linear part is approaching 0 faster? Wait, no. Let's compute the limit as a approaches 0+:\n\nlim_{a→0+} (a³ - (a² + 2a)) = 0 - 0 = 0. But the derivative of a³ - a² - 2a is 3a² - 2a - 2. At a = 0, derivative is -2, which is negative. So, near a = 0, a³ - a² - 2a is negative, so a³ < a² + 2a. Therefore, for 0 < a < 2, the quadratic part at x = a is below the linear part approaching from the left, creating a gap between the two pieces. For a = 2, they meet. For a > 2, the quadratic part at x = a is a³, and the linear part approaching from the left is a² + 2a. Let's check a = 3: 27 vs 9 + 6 = 15. So, 27 > 15, so the quadratic part is higher. So, for a > 2, the quadratic part at x = a is above the linear part.\n\nTherefore, when a > 2, the two pieces of the function meet at x = a, and the quadratic part is above the linear part. For 0 < a < 2, there's a gap between the two parts at x = a. For a = 2, they meet. \n\nNow, considering a < 0. Let's analyze that case. If a is negative, then the quadratic part is ax², which is a downward-opening parabola since a is negative. The vertex of the parabola is still at (0, 0), but since it's defined only for x ≥ a, and a is negative, the domain of the quadratic part starts at x = a (negative x). As x increases from a to 0, ax² decreases because squaring a negative x gives a positive value, and multiplying by a negative a gives a negative value. Then, from x = 0 onwards, the quadratic part continues decreasing until x approaches positive infinity, but since a is negative, ax² is negative and becomes more negative as x increases. Wait, no. Wait, if a is negative, then ax² is negative for all x ≠ 0. As x increases from a (negative) to 0, ax² becomes less negative (since squaring makes it positive and multiplying by a negative a makes it negative again but with a larger magnitude as x moves towards 0). Wait, this is confusing. Let me take a specific example. Let a = -1. Then, for x ≥ -1, f(x) = -x². So, at x = -1, f(-1) = -1. At x = 0, f(0) = 0. For x > 0, f(x) = -x², which decreases from 0 to negative infinity as x increases. So, the quadratic part for a negative a is a downward-opening parabola starting at x = a (negative) and going down to negative infinity as x increases.\n\nThe linear part for x < a is f(x) = ax + 2a. If a is negative, then this is a line with slope a (negative) and y-intercept 2a. So, as x approaches a from the left, the value approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For a negative, let's take a = -1 again. Then, the linear part at x approaching -1 from the left is (-1)(-1) + 2*(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1. Which matches the quadratic part at x = -1. So, for a = -1, the linear and quadratic parts meet at x = -1. For other a < 0, let's see. Let's take a = -2. Then, the quadratic part is f(x) = -2x² for x ≥ -2, and the linear part is f(x) = -2x + 2*(-2) = -2x -4 for x < -2. At x = -2, the quadratic part is -2*(-2)^2 = -8. The linear part as x approaches -2 from the left is -2*(-2) -4 = 4 -4 = 0. So, there's a jump discontinuity at x = -2. The quadratic part is -8, and the linear part approaches 0. So, there's a gap between the two parts.\n\nSimilarly, for a < 0, the quadratic part is a downward-opening parabola starting at x = a (negative) and going down to negative infinity as x increases. The linear part for x < a is a line with negative slope, starting from negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, and approaching a² + 2a at x = a. Let's check when a² + 2a is greater than the quadratic part's value at x = a, which is a³. So, compare a² + 2a and a³ for a < 0.\n\nTake a = -1: a² + 2a = 1 - 2 = -1; a³ = -1. They are equal. For a = -2: a a² + 2a = 4 -4 = 0; a³ = -8. So, 0 > -8. Therefore, for a < 0, the linear part at x = a is greater than the quadratic part. For a = -0.5: a² + 2a = 0.25 -1 = -0.75; a³ = -0.125. So, -0.75 < -0.125. Therefore, for a < 0, the linear part at x = a is less than the quadratic part. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor a < 0, the quadratic part at x = a is a³. The linear part as x approaches a from the left is a² + 2a. So, compare a³ and a² + 2a.\n\nTake a = -0.5: a³ = -0.125, a² + 2a = 0.25 -1 = -0.75. So, a³ (-0.125) is greater than a² + 2a (-0.75). So, quadratic part is higher. For a = -2: a³ = -8, a² + 2a = 4 -4 = 0. So, quadratic is -8, linear is 0. Quadratic is lower. So, it seems that for a < 0, depending on the value of a, the comparison between a³ and a² + 2a can vary. Let's solve a³ = a² + 2a.\n\na³ - a² - 2a = 0\n\na(a² - a - 2) = 0\n\na(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\n\nSolutions: a = 0, a = 2, a = -1.\n\nSo, when a = -1, they are equal. For a < -1, let's take a = -2: a³ = -8, a² + 2a = 4 -4 = 0. So, quadratic part is lower. For a between -1 and 0, like a = -0.5: quadratic part is higher. So, at a = -1, they are equal. Therefore, for a < -1, the linear part at x = a is higher than the quadratic part, and for -1 < a < 0, the quadratic part is higher than the linear part.\n\nTherefore, the graph's continuity and the values depend on the value of a. But the problem doesn't mention continuity, just that the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once. So, even if there's a jump discontinuity, as long as the function covers all y-values, it's okay.\n\nBut the key is that for each horizontal line y = k, there must be at least one x such that f(x) = k. So, we need to ensure that both pieces of the function cover all real numbers. However, since the quadratic part (for x ≥ a) is a parabola (either opening upwards or downwards depending on a) and the linear part (for x < a) is a line, their combined graph may have gaps unless they overlap in their ranges.\n\nTo cover all", "answer": "2"}
{"original_question": "Pour quelle valeur de $c$ le cercle avec l'équation $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$ aura-t-il un rayon de longueur 1 ?", "question": "Pour quelle valeur de $c$ le cercle avec l'équation $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$ aura-t-il un rayon de longueur 1 ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: For which value of c does the circle with the equation x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0 have a radius of length 1? Hmm, let me think. I remember that the general equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. So, the given equation isn't in that standard form, so I need to complete the squares for both x and y terms to convert it into the standard form. Then, once I have it in that form, I can compare the right-hand side to r² and set r² equal to 1², which is 1. That should give me the value of c. Let me try to do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equation again: x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0. I need to complete the square for the x terms and the y terms separately. Let's start with the x terms: x² - 10x. To complete the square, I take the coefficient of x, which is -10, divide it by 2, getting -5, and then square it, which is 25. So, x² - 10x can be written as (x - 5)² - 25. Wait, let me check that. If I expand (x - 5)², that's x² - 10x + 25. So, to get x² - 10x from that, I need to subtract 25. So yes, x² - 10x = (x - 5)² - 25. Got that.\n\nNow for the y terms: y² + 6y. Similarly, completing the square here. Take the coefficient of y, which is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, square it to get 9. So, y² + 6y = (y + 3)² - 9. Let me verify: (y + 3)² is y² + 6y + 9, so subtracting 9 gives y² + 6y. Correct.\n\nSo now, substituting these back into the original equation. The original equation was x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0. Replacing the x terms and y terms with the completed squares:\n\n(x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 3)² - 9 + c = 0.\n\nCombine the constants: -25 - 9 + c = -34 + c. So the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 5)² + (y + 3)² - 34 + c = 0.\n\nThen, moving the constant term to the other side:\n\n(x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = 34 - c.\n\nNow, this is in the standard form of a circle: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where the center is (5, -3) and the radius squared is 34 - c. The problem states that the radius is 1, so r² = 1² = 1. Therefore, we set 34 - c equal to 1:\n\n34 - c = 1.\n\nSolving for c:\n\nSubtract 34 from both sides: -c = 1 - 34 => -c = -33.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: c = 33.\n\nWait, so c should be 33? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0.\n\nCompleted squares:\n\nx² -10x = (x-5)² -25\n\ny² +6y = (y+3)² -9\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n(x-5)² -25 + (y+3)² -9 +c =0\n\nCombine constants: -25 -9 = -34. So:\n\n(x-5)² + (y+3)² -34 +c =0\n\nMove constants to the other side:\n\n(x-5)² + (y+3)² = 34 -c\n\nSet equal to r² which is 1:\n\n34 -c =1\n\nSo c=34 -1=33. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, that would give (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 -1 =0, so (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 =1. Which is indeed a circle with radius 1. So that checks out. So c=33 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is c=33.

That is, f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x. Hmm. Let's start by understanding what the function f is. It's given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). So that's a quadratic function that maps [0,1] to [0,1]. The parameter λ scales the function. \n\nFirst, maybe I should recall that for a function f, a point x where f(x) = x is called a fixed point. If x isn't a fixed point, but f(f(x)) = x, then x is part of a 2-cycle. So the problem is asking for the λ where there's a 2-cycle, but no fixed points. Wait, but actually, even if there are fixed points, if there's a 2-cycle, then those fixed points could be unstable or stable. But in any case, for our problem, we just need the existence of a 2-cycle where the points aren't fixed. So even if there are fixed points, as long as there's another 2-cycle, that's okay? Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as \"iliste de λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤4, pour lesquelles il exists x ∈ [0,1] tel que f(x) ≠x mais f(f(x))=x.\" So it's just asking for the λ where there exists at least one x which isn't a fixed point but is a periodic point of period 2. So even if there are fixed points, as long as there's some x that's part of a 2-cycle, then that λ counts. But we need to consider all λ where such an x exists. \n\nSo my job is to find all λ in [0,4] where f has a 2-cycle. But not all cycles, just 2-cycles. So maybe we need to solve for x such that f(f(x)) = x, but f(x) ≠ x. Let's write down the equations.\n\nFirst, f(x) = λx(1 - x). Then f(f(x)) would be λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]. So that's f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]. Let's write that out:\n\nf(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x) * [1 - λx(1 - x)]\n\nWe want this equal to x, so:\n\nλ^2 x(1 - x) [1 - λx(1 - x)] = x\n\nBut we also want f(x) ≠ x, so λx(1 - x) ≠ x. \n\nSo let's first set up the equation f(f(x)) = x. Let's subtract x from both sides:\n\nλ^2 x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ λ^2 (1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] - 1 ] = 0\n\nSo either x = 0, or the other factor is zero. But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is a fixed point, because f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0. Wait, f(1) is 0, but 0 is a fixed point. So x = 0 and x = 1 are always fixed points regardless of λ. So if we are looking for x where f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x, then x cannot be 0 or 1. So we need to solve the equation when x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 1.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the equation:\n\nλ^2 (1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] - 1 = 0\n\nLet me expand this equation step by step. Let's denote y = x for simplicity. Then:\n\nλ^2 (1 - y)[1 - λy(1 - y)] - 1 = 0\n\nFirst, expand the inner term [1 - λy(1 - y)]:\n\n1 - λy + λ y^2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nλ^2 (1 - y)(1 - λy + λ y^2) - 1 = 0\n\nNow let's multiply out (1 - y)(1 - λy + λ y^2):\n\nFirst, multiply 1*(1 - λy + λ y^2) = 1 - λy + λ y^2\n\nThen, multiply -y*(1 - λy + λ y^2) = -y + λ y^2 - λ y^3\n\nCombine these:\n\n1 - λy + λ y^2 - y + λ y^2 - λ y^3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - (λy + y) + (λ y^2 + λ y^2) - λ y^3\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 - y(λ + 1) + 2λ y^2 - λ y^3\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nλ^2 [1 - y(λ + 1) + 2λ y^2 - λ y^3] - 1 = 0\n\nExpand this:\n\nλ^2 - λ^2 y(λ + 1) + 2λ^3 y^2 - λ^3 y^3 - 1 = 0\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n-λ^3 y^3 + 2λ^3 y^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)y + (λ^2 - 1) = 0\n\nNote that λ^2 - 1 is the constant term here.\n\nBut since we know that x = 0 and x = 1 are solutions to f(f(x)) = x, but we need the other solutions where x ≠ 0,1. So maybe we can factor out (y - 0) and (y - 1) from the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's recall that fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, which is λx(1 - x) = x. Let's solve that equation:\n\nλx(1 - x) = x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nλx(1 - x) - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ λ(1 - x) - 1 ] = 0\n\nSo either x = 0, or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0. The latter gives:\n\nλ(1 - x) = 1 => 1 - x = 1/λ => x = 1 - 1/λ\n\nBut x must be in [0,1], so 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 => 1/λ ≤ 1 => λ ≥ 1. But since λ is in [0,4], so for λ ≥1, x = 1 - 1/λ is a fixed point in [0,1]. For λ <1, the only fixed point is x=0.\n\nTherefore, the fixed points are x=0 (always), and for λ ≥1, x=1 - 1/λ. Wait, but when λ=1, x=1 -1/1=0, so x=0 is still a fixed point. For λ >1, x=1 -1/λ is another fixed point. For example, λ=2, x=1 -1/2=1/2.\n\nSo now, returning to the equation f(f(x))=x. We have solutions at x=0, x=1, and potentially other solutions. But we need solutions where x ≠0 and x≠1. So let's consider the equation f(f(x))=x, excluding x=0 and x=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if x is a period-2 point, then it's not a fixed point, so f(x) ≠x, but f(f(x))=x. So to find such x, we can solve f(f(x))=x and exclude the fixed points. So let's write the equation f(f(x))=x and subtract the fixed points.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to set up the equation f(f(x))=x and then subtract x from both sides, then factor out x, which gives x*(something) =0, so x=0 or something=0. Then the something=0 gives the other solutions. So let's do that.\n\nWe have:\n\nf(f(x)) = x\n\nSo substituting f(x):\n\nλ [ λ x (1 - x) ] [1 - λ x (1 - x) ] = x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nλ² x (1 - x) [1 - λ x (1 - x) ] = x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nλ² x (1 - x) [1 - λ x (1 - x) ] - x =0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ λ² (1 - x)(1 - λ x (1 - x)) -1 ] =0\n\nTherefore, solutions are x=0 or solutions to:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λ x (1 - x)) -1 =0\n\nWe can ignore x=0 and x=1 (since x=1 would make f(x)=0, and then f(f(1))=f(0)=0≠1, so x=1 is not a solution). So we can focus on solving:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λ x (1 - x)) -1 =0\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λ x (1 - x)) =1\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let me let y = x - 1/2, but not sure. Alternatively, expand the terms.\n\nFirst, expand (1 - x)(1 - λ x (1 - x)):\n\nFirst, compute the inner term: 1 - λ x (1 - x) =1 - λ x + λ x²\n\nThen multiply by (1 - x):\n\n(1 - x)(1 - λ x + λ x²) = (1)(1 - λ x + λ x²) -x(1 - λ x + λ x²)\n\n=1 - λ x + λ x² -x + λ x² - λ x³\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - (λ x + x) + (λ x² + λ x²) - λ x³\n\n=1 - x(λ +1) + 2λ x² - λ x³\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² [1 - x(λ +1) + 2λ x² - λ x³] =1\n\nWhich is:\n\nλ² - λ² x(λ +1) + 2λ³ x² - λ³ x³ =1\n\nBring 1 to the left:\n\nλ² -1 - λ² x(λ +1) + 2λ³ x² - λ³ x³ =0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x:\n\n-λ³ x³ + 2λ³ x² - λ²(λ +1)x + (λ² -1)=0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ²(λ +1)x - (λ² -1)=0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out λ² from the first three terms:\n\nWait, wait, let's check the coefficients again:\n\nWait, the cubic term is -λ³ x³,\n\nquadratic term is +2λ³ x²,\n\nlinear term is -λ²(λ +1)x,\n\nconstant term is + (λ² -1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can factor this equation. Let's see.\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\n-λ³ x³ + 2λ³ x² - λ²(λ +1)x + (λ² -1)=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ²(λ +1)x - (λ² -1)=0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out λ²:\n\nλ² [λ x³ - 2λ x² + (λ +1)x] - (λ² -1)=0\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, maybe factor x from the first three terms:\n\nx [ λ³ x² - 2λ³ x + λ²(λ +1) ] - (λ² -1)=0\n\nBut not helpful. Alternatively, check if x=1 is a root. Let's plug x=1:\n\nλ³(1) -2λ³(1) + λ²(λ +1)(1) - (λ² -1) = λ³ -2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² +1 = (λ³ -2λ³ + λ³) + (λ² - λ²) +1 =0 +0 +1=1≠0. So x=1 is not a root.\n\nSimilarly, check x=0:\n\n0 -0 +0 - (λ² -1)= -λ² +1. So if -λ² +1=0, then λ=1. So x=0 is a root only when λ=1. But we already know x=0 is a fixed point for all λ, so maybe in that case, it's a fixed point. But we are looking for roots other than x=0 and x=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write this cubic equation as:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ²(λ +1)x - (λ² -1)=0\n\nLet me try to factor this. Suppose there is a rational root. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of (λ² -1) divided by factors of λ³. But since coefficients are in terms of λ, this is not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps substitute t = x. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation is:\n\nλ²(λ +1)x - λ³ x³ -2λ³ x² - (λ² -1) =0\n\nWait, perhaps rearrange terms:\n\nλ²(λ +1)x - (λ³ x³ + 2λ³ x²) - (λ² -1)=0\n\nFactor λ³ x² from the cubic terms:\n\n= λ²(λ +1)x - λ³ x²( x + 2 ) - (λ² -1)=0\n\nStill not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the equation is a cubic in x, so perhaps we can write it as:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ²(λ +1)x - (λ² -1) =0\n\nLet me factor out λ²:\n\nλ² [λ x³ - 2λ x² + (λ +1)x ] - (λ² -1)=0\n\nHmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by λ² (assuming λ ≠0):\n\nλ x³ - 2λ x² + (λ +1)x - (1 - 1/λ²)=", "answer": "(3,4]"}

The numerator is cos5°cos20° + cos35°cos50° - sin5°sin20° - sin35°sin50°, and the denominator is sin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°. Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator using some trigonometric identities. Let me start by looking at the numerator.\n\nThe numerator has two products of cosines and two products of sines, each with different angles. The first two terms are cos5°cos20° and cos35°cos50°, and the last two terms are -sin5°sin20° and -sin35°sin50°. Wait a minute, these might be related to the cosine addition formula. Remember that cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. But here, in the numerator, we have cosA cosB minus sinC sinD. Maybe not directly. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe grouping terms.\n\nLet me group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\nNumerator = (cos5°cos20° - sin5°sin20°) + (cos35°cos50° - sin35°sin50°)\n\nOh! Wait, cosA cosB - sinA sinB is equal to cos(A + B). Because the formula is cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So that's useful. So then, the first group is cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°, and the second group is cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°. So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°. That's a good start.\n\nNow, let's check the denominator. The denominator is sin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°. Let me rearrange the terms:\n\nDenominator = (sin5°cos20° + cos5°sin20°) - (sin35°cos50° + cos35°sin50°)\n\nAgain, those are sine addition formulas. Remember that sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So the first part is sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°, and the second part is sin(35° + 50°) = sin85°. So the denominator becomes sin25° - sin85°.\n\nSo now, putting numerator and denominator together, the expression simplifies to:\n\ntanθ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]\n\nAlright, that's better. Now, let's see if we can simplify this further. Maybe use sum-to-product identities on the numerator and denominator.\n\nStarting with the numerator: cos25° + cos85°. The sum-to-product identity for cosines is:\n\ncosA + cosB = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] cos[(A - B)/2]\n\nSo applying that here, A = 25°, B = 85°, so:\n\ncos25° + cos85° = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°)\n\nBut cos(-30°) is equal to cos30°, so this becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator is sin25° - sin85°. The sum-to-product identity for sines is:\n\nsinA - sinB = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nSo applying that here, A = 25°, B = 85°:\n\nsin25° - sin85° = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°)\n\nBut sin(-30°) is -sin30°, which is -0.5. So this becomes 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°.\n\nTherefore, putting numerator and denominator together:\n\ntanθ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-cos55°] = [2 cos30°] / (-1) = -2 cos30°\n\nBut cos30° is √3/2, so:\n\ntanθ = -2*(√3/2) = -√3\n\nWait, so tanθ = -√3. But θ is supposed to be the smallest positive angle. Hmm. So when is tanθ = -√3? Well, tanθ = √3 at θ = 60°, so tanθ = -√3 would be at θ = 180° - 60° = 120°, or in the second quadrant. But angles are positive, so the smallest positive angle where tanθ = -√3 is 120°, since tan120° = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So θ = 120°. But wait, the problem says the smallest positive angle. But 120° is the first positive angle where tanθ = -√3. But I need to confirm if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\ncos5°cos20° + cos35°cos50° - sin5°sin20° - sin35°sin50°\n\nGrouped as (cos5°cos20° - sin5°sin20°) + (cos35°cos50° - sin35°sin50°) = cos(25°) + cos(85°). That's correct because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, but here we have cosA cosB - sinA sinB = cos(A + B). Wait, hold on. Wait, cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So yes, that's correct. So the first group is cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°, and the second group is cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°, so numerator is cos25° + cos85°. Then applying sum-to-product:\n\ncos25° + cos85° = 2 cos55° cos30°, correct. Because (25 + 85)/2 = 55°, (25 - 85)/2 = -30°, cos(-30°) = cos30°, so 2 cos55° cos30°.\n\nDenominator:\n\nsin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°\n\nGrouped as (sin5°cos20° + cos5°sin20°) - (sin35°cos50° + cos35°sin50°) = sin(25°) - sin(85°). Correct, because sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So first group is sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°, second group is sin(35° + 50°) = sin85°, so denominator is sin25° - sin85°. Then applying sum-to-product for sine subtraction:\n\nsin25° - sin85° = 2 cos55° sin(-30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°, since sin(-x) = -sinx. sin30° is 0.5, so denominator is -2 cos55° * 0.5 = -cos55°, which is correct. So denominator is -cos55°.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-cos55°] = -2 cos30°, as before. Since cos30° = √3/2, so that's -√3. Therefore, tanθ = -√3. So θ is 120°, since tan120° = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So the smallest positive angle is 120°, which is the answer. Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller positive angle where tanθ = -√3. The period of tanθ is 180°, so the solutions are θ = 120° + 180°k, where k is integer. So the smallest positive angle is 120°, yes.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says \"positive angle θ\", so θ must be greater than 0°, so 120° is the smallest. Therefore, the answer is 120°, which in boxed form is \\boxed{120}.\n\nWait, but let me check once again. Because sometimes when you manipulate trigonometric expressions, there might be an identity or a step that I overlooked. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator: cos5°cos20° + cos35°cos50° - sin5°sin20° - sin35°sin50°\n\nGrouped as (cos5°cos20° - sin5°sin20°) + (cos35°cos50° - sin35°sin50°)\n\nEach of these is cos(A + B):\n\ncos5°cos20° - sin5°sin20° = cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°\n\ncos35°cos50° - sin35°sin50° = cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°\n\nSo numerator: cos25° + cos85°, correct.\n\nDenominator:\n\nOriginal denominator: sin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°\n\nGrouped as (sin5°cos20° + cos5°sin20°) - (sin35°cos50° + cos35°sin50°)\n\nEach of these is sin(A + B):\n\nsin5°cos20° + cos5°sin20° = sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°\n\nsin35°cos50° + cos35°sin50° = sin(35° + 50°) = sin85°\n\nSo denominator: sin25° - sin85°, correct.\n\nThen, applying sum-to-product:\n\nNumerator: cos25° + cos85° = 2 cos55° cos30°, correct.\n\nDenominator: sin25° - sin85° = -2 cos55° sin30°, which is -cos55°, correct.\n\nTherefore, tanθ = (2 cos55° cos30°)/(-cos55°) = -2 cos30° = -√3.\n\nTherefore, θ = arctan(-√3). The arctangent of -√3. Since tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. The principal value of arctan(-√3) is -60°, but we need the smallest positive angle. So -60° + 180° = 120°, which is the smallest positive angle. Therefore, θ = 120°, which is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative.

The problem is to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ELLIPSE. Hmm, right. So first, I need to check if there are any repeated letters in the word. Let me write down the letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. \n\nAlright, let's count each letter. The letter E appears twice, and the letter L appears twice as well. The other letters are I, P, S, which are all unique. So, there are 7 letters in total with two E's and two L's. \n\nI remember that when you have a word with repeated letters, the number of distinct permutations is the factorial of the total number of letters divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated letter. So the formula should be something like 7! divided by (2! for the E's times 2! for the L's). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the general formula for permutations of multiset is:\n\nNumber of arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each distinct item.\n\nIn this case, n is 7 (since ELLIPSE has 7 letters). The letters E and L each appear twice, and the rest are unique. So plugging into the formula:\n\nNumber of arrangements = 7! / (2! * 2!)\n\nLet me compute that. First, 7! is 7 factorial. Let's calculate that:\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n\nThen 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! = 2 × 2 = 4\n\nSo 5040 divided by 4 is 1260.\n\nWait, let me double-check the division. 5040 divided by 4. 4 goes into 50 four times (4*12=48) with a remainder of 2. Then bring down the 4 to make 24. 4 goes into 24 six times. Then bring down the 5. 4 into 5 once with remainder 1. Bring down the 0. 4 into 10 twice with remainder 2. Then bring down the next 0. Wait, maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n5040 ÷ 4 = (5000 + 40) ÷ 4 = 5000 ÷ 4 + 40 ÷ 4 = 1250 + 10 = 1260. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of distinct arrangements should be 1260. Let me just make sure there aren't any other repeated letters that I missed. The word ELLIPSE: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L are the only ones repeated twice. The others are unique. So yes, the formula applies here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5040 divided by 4, which is 1260. So 1260 distinct ways to arrange the letters.\n</think>\n\nThe word ELLIPSE consists of 7 letters with repetitions: E (2 times), L (2 times), and I, P, S each appearing once.

Hmm, factorials can get really big, and trailing zeros are those numbers at the end before the actual digits of the factorial start. For example, 5! is 120, which has one trailing zero. So how do I find out how many zeros are at the end of 42!?\n\nI remember that trailing zeros in a number come from factors of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of the number contributes to a trailing zero. But in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s, right? So the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nSo the strategy here is to count the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. Then, each of those 5s will pair with a 2 to make a 10, contributing to a trailing zero. Since there are more 2s than 5s, we don't have to worry about the 2s running out.\n\nTo count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!, I can use the method where you divide 42 by 5, take the integer part, then divide by 25, take the integer part, and so on until the division result is zero. Then add up all those numbers.\n\nLet me explain. For each multiple of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42, there's at least one 5. But some numbers have more than one 5, like 25, which is 5 squared. So those contribute an extra 5. So we need to account for that.\n\nFirst, divide 42 by 5. 42 ÷ 5 is 8.4. But we take the integer part, which is 8. That means there are 8 multiples of 5 between 1 and 42.\n\nBut then, we need to check for multiples of 25, because each of those contributes an extra 5. So divide 42 by 25. 42 ÷ 25 is 1.68. Taking the integer part gives 1. That means there's 1 multiple of 25 (which is 25 itself) in the numbers from 1 to 42. This contributes an additional 5.\n\nNext, check for multiples of higher powers of 5, like 125. But 125 is larger than 42, so dividing 42 by 125 would give 0. So we can stop here.\n\nAdding them up: 8 (from the multiples of 5) + 1 (from the multiples of 25) = 9. Therefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let me list out the multiples of 5 between 1 and 42: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. Among these, 25 is 5 squared, so it has an extra 5. So each of these numbers contributes at least one 5, and 25 contributes an additional one. So total number of 5s is 8 + 1 = 9. Then, since there are more than enough 2s to pair with these 5s, the number of trailing zeros should be 9. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can check with a smaller factorial to see if this method works. For example, 10!. The number of trailing zeros should be 2. Let's apply the method: 10 ÷ 5 = 2, and 10 ÷ 25 = 0. So total 2, which is correct. Similarly, 25!: 25 ÷5 =5, 25 ÷25=1, 25 ÷125=0. So total 5+1=6 trailing zeros. Let me check 25! manually. 25! is a very large number, but I know that 25! ends with 6 zeros, so that works. So the method seems valid.\n\nTherefore, applying this method to 42!, which is 42 ÷5=8, 42 ÷25=1, so total 8+1=9. So the answer should be 9. Therefore, there are 9 zeros at the end of 42!.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are more factors of 2 than 5 in \\(42!\\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nWe use the method of dividing 42 by increasing powers of 5 and taking the floor of each result:\n\n1. Divide 42 by 5: \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   This counts the multiples of 5.\n\n2. Divide 42 by 25 (the next power of 5):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n   This counts the multiples of 25, which contribute an extra factor of 5.\n\n3. Divide 42 by 125 (a higher power of 5):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n   \\]\n   This and higher powers contribute nothing.\n\nAdding these results gives the total number of factors of 5:\n\\[\n8 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).", "answer": "9"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function looks symmetric in x and y. That might be helpful. Maybe I can assume that x = y at the maximum? Let me test that idea. If I set x = y, then the function becomes f(x, x) = x√(1 - x²) + x√(1 - x²) = 2x√(1 - x²). Then, to find the maximum of this, I can take the derivative with respect to x and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of 2x√(1 - x²). Let's denote g(x) = 2x√(1 - x²). The derivative g’(x) would be 2√(1 - x²) + 2x*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = 2√(1 - x²) - (2x²)/√(1 - x²). Setting this equal to zero:\n\n2√(1 - x²) - (2x²)/√(1 - x²) = 0  \nMultiply both sides by √(1 - x²):  \n2(1 - x²) - 2x² = 0  \n2 - 2x² - 2x² = 0  \n2 - 4x² = 0  \n4x² = 2  \nx² = 1/2  \nx = ±√(1/2) = ±√2/2 ≈ ±0.707\n\nSo the maximum when x = y is at x = √2/2, and the value is 2*(√2/2)*√(1 - 1/2) = 2*(√2/2)*(√(1/2)) = 2*(√2/2)*(1/√2) = 2*(1/2) = 1. So when x = y = √2/2, f(x, y) = 1.\n\nBut wait, is this the actual maximum of the original function? Maybe there's a higher value when x ≠ y. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use trigonometric substitution because of the square roots. Let me set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, since √(1 - x²) would then be cosθ if x = sinθ. But I need to be careful with the ranges. Since x and y are between -1 and 1, θ and φ can be between -π/2 and π/2, but maybe it's easier to consider θ and φ in [0, π/2] since the function is symmetric and we're looking for maximum, which is likely positive.\n\nSo substituting x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then √(1 - x²) = cosθ and √(1 - y²) = cosφ. Then the function becomes:\n\nf(θ, φ) = sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ = sin(θ + φ)\n\nSo f(θ, φ) = sin(θ + φ). The maximum value of sin is 1, so the maximum of f(θ, φ) is 1, achieved when θ + φ = π/2. Then, θ and φ would be such that θ + φ = π/2. Let me check if this corresponds to x and y values.\n\nIf θ + φ = π/2, then since x = sinθ and y = sinφ, we have y = sin(π/2 - θ) = cosθ. So y = cosθ and x = sinθ. Therefore, x = sinθ and y = cosθ. Then, x² + y² = sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So x and y must satisfy x² + y² = 1. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1, achieved when x² + y² = 1. Wait, but in the original problem, x and y can be between -1 and 1, but if x and y are on the unit circle, then they can only take values such that x² + y² = 1, which is a subset of the given domain. So, in this case, if x and y are on the unit circle, then f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ) = sin(π/2) = 1. So that's consistent.\n\nBut does this mean that the maximum is indeed 1? Wait, but when we set x = y = √2/2, which gives x² + y² = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, so that point is on the unit circle. So both approaches give the same maximum. So maybe 1 is indeed the maximum.\n\nBut let me verify with another method. Let's use Lagrange multipliers. The function to maximize is f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²). The domain is all (x, y) with x, y ∈ [-1, 1]. So we can set up the Lagrangian with the constraint x² + y² = 1? Wait, but actually, the maximum may not necessarily be on the boundary. Wait, but in the trigonometric substitution, we found that the maximum is achieved when x and y are on the unit circle. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if we use Lagrange multipliers without assuming x and y are on the unit circle, maybe we can check.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives of f(x, y):\n\nFirst, ∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) + x*(0) + y*( (1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) ) = √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²)\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y = x*( (1/(2√(1 - y²)))*(-2y) ) + √(1 - x²) = - (xy)/√(1 - y²) + √(1 - x²)\n\nSet these partial derivatives to zero.\n\nSo we have:\n\n√(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²) = 0  ...(1)  \n- (xy)/√(1 - y²) + √(1 - x²) = 0  ...(2)\n\nLet me write equation (1) as:\n\n√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)  \nSquare both sides:  \n1 - y² = (x² y²)/(1 - x²)  \nMultiply both sides by (1 - x²):  \n(1 - y²)(1 - x²) = x² y²  \nExpand left side:  \n1 - x² - y² + x² y² = x² y²  \nSubtract x² y² from both sides:  \n1 - x² - y² = 0  \nSo x² + y² = 1\n\nSimilarly, take equation (2):\n\n- (xy)/√(1 - y²) + √(1 - x²) = 0  \nRearrange:  \n√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)  \nSquare both sides:  \n1 - x² = (x² y²)/(1 - y²)  \nMultiply both sides by (1 - y²):  \n(1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x² y²  \nWhich is the same as equation (1) after expansion, leading to x² + y² = 1\n\nTherefore, the critical points occur when x² + y² = 1. So on the unit circle. Therefore, to find the maximum, we can restrict to x² + y² = 1, and then the function becomes f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ) = 1 as before. So the maximum is indeed 1.\n\nBut let me check if there are other critical points on the boundaries. For example, when x or y is at the extremes, like x = 1, then f(1, y) = 1*√(1 - y²) + y*√(1 - 1) = √(1 - y²) + 0. The maximum of √(1 - y²) is 1 when y = 0. So f(1, 0) = 1. Similarly, f(0, 1) = 1. So the function can also achieve 1 on the boundaries. So even on the boundaries, the maximum is 1. Therefore, the overall maximum is 1.\n\nBut let me check another point. For example, x = √2/2 and y = √2/2, which gives f(x, y) = 1. If I take x = y = 1/2, then f(1/2, 1/2) = (1/2)√(1 - 1/4) + (1/2)√(1 - 1/4) = (1/2)*(√(3)/2) + (1/2)*(√(3)/2) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1. So indeed, 1 is larger.\n\nAnother test: x = √3/2, y = 1/2. Then f(√3/2, 1/2) = (√3/2)*√(1 - 1/4) + (1/2)*√(1 - 3/4) = (√3/2)*(√3/2) + (1/2)*(1/2) = (3/4) + (1/4) = 1. So that's also 1. Interesting. So even when x and y are different but satisfy x² + y² = 1, the function f(x, y) = 1. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf x² + y² = 1, then f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²). Since x² + y² =1, √(1 - y²) = |x| and √(1 - x²) = |y|. But since x and y are between -1 and 1, but the square roots are non-negative. However, if x and y are positive, then √(1 - y²) = x and √(1 - x²) = y. Wait, no. Wait, if x is positive, then √(1 - y²) is √(1 - y²), which is not necessarily x. Wait, hold on. If x² + y² =1, then 1 - y² = x², so √(1 - y²) = |x|. Similarly, √(1 - x²) = |y|. So if x and y are non-negative, then √(1 - y²) = x and √(1 - x²) = y, so f(x, y) = x*x + y*y = x² + y² =1. So if x and y are non-negative and x² + y² =1, then f(x, y) =1. Similarly, if x and y are negative, then √(1 - y²) = |x| = -x (since x is negative) and √(1 - x²) = |y| = -y. So f(x, y) = x*(-x) + y*(-y) = -x² - y². Since x² + y² =1, this becomes -1, which is the minimum. So the maximum on the unit circle is 1 when x and y are non-negative, and the minimum is -1 when x and y are negative.\n\nBut in the original problem, x and y can be between -1 and 1, so the maximum is 1, achieved when x and y are non-negative and x² + y² =1. For example, x = y = √2/2, or x =1, y=0, etc.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another method. Suppose I use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let's consider vectors u = (x, y) and v = (√(1 - y²), √(1 - x²)). Then f(x, y) = u · v. By Cauchy-Schwarz, |u · v| ≤ ||u|| ||v||. Compute ||u||² = x² + y², ||v||² = (1 - y²) + (1 - x²) = 2 - x² - y². So ||u|| ||v|| = sqrt(x² + y²) * sqrt(2 - x² - y²). Let me denote S = x² + y². Then the product is sqrt(S(2 - S)). To maximize sqrt(S(2 - S)), we need to maximize S(2 - S). The maximum of S(2 - S) occurs when S =1, since it's a quadratic function with maximum at S =1. So S(2 - S) =1*(2 -1)=1. Therefore, sqrt(1) =1. Hence, the maximum of |u · v| is 1. Therefore, the maximum of f(x, y) is 1. This confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is indeed 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value of \\( f(x, y) \\) is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x, y) = x \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) where \\( -1 \\le x, y \\le 1 \\), we can use trigonometric substitution and symmetry arguments.\n\n1. **Trigonometric Substitution**:\n   - Let \\( x = \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( y = \\sin \\phi \\).

Let me recall how to do this. Hmm, I think the area of a triangle can be found using the cross product of two vectors. Right, because the magnitude of the cross product gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, so half of that would be the area of the triangle. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, if I have two vectors in space, the cross product of those vectors is a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by them, and half of that magnitude would be the area of the triangle. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the formula should be (1/2) * ||OA × OB||, where || is the magnitude of the cross product.\n\nAlright, so first I need to compute the cross product of vectors OA and OB. Let me write down the vectors:\n\nVector OA is <1, 2, 3>, and vector OB is <-3, -2, 1>. To compute the cross product OA × OB, I can use the determinant method with the unit vectors i, j, k.\n\nThe cross product is calculated as follows:\n\ni component: (OA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y)\nj component: -(OA_x * OB_z - OA_z * OB_x)\nk component: (OA_x * OB_y - OA_y * OB_x)\n\nWait, let me check that again.

So expanding that determinant gives the cross product components.\n\nSo, let's compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst, the i component: OA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y. OA_y is 2, OB_z is 1. So 2*1 = 2. OA_z is 3, OB_y is -2. So 3*(-2) = -6. Therefore, the i component is 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\nWait, no, hold on.

So 3*(-2) = -6.\n\nTherefore, the i component is 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8. Got that right.\n\nNext, the j component: a3b1 - a1b3. Because the formula is:\n\nj component: -(a3b1 - a1b3). Wait, no, let me check again. The cross product is:\n\na × b = (a2b3 - a3b2)i - (a1b3 - a3b1)j + (a1b2 - a2b1)k\n\nWait, that's another way to write it. So, the i component is a2b3 - a3b2, the j component is -(a1b3 - a3b1), and the k component is a1b2 - a2b1.\n\nSo for the j component, first compute a1b3 - a3b1. a1 is OA_x = 1, b3 is OB_z = 1. So 1*1 = 1. a3 is OA_z = 3, b1 is OB_x = -3. So 3*(-3) = -9. Therefore, a1b3 - a3b1 = 1 - (-9) = 1 + 9 = 10. Then, since it's -(a1b3 - a3b1), the j component is -10.\n\nNow the k component: a1b2 - a2b1. a1 is 1, b2 is OB_y = -2. So 1*(-2) = -2. a2 is 2, b1 is -3. So 2*(-3) = -6. Therefore, a1b2 - a2b1 = -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is <8, -10, 4>.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Because if I use the determinant method:\n\ni |  j |  k\n1 |  2 | 3\n-3 | -2 | 1\n\nSo, the i component is (2*1 - 3*(-2)) = 2 + 6 = 8. Correct.\n\nThe j component is -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.\n\nThe k component is (1*(-2) - 2*(-3)) = (-2 + 6) = 4. Correct. So the cross product is indeed (8, -10, 4).\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude ||v|| is sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2).\n\nSo ||OA × OB|| = sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(64 + 100 + 16) = sqrt(180).\n\nSimplify sqrt(180). Let's see, 180 = 36 * 5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, the magnitude is 6√5.\n\nThen, the area of triangle OAB is half of that, so (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, cross product components:\n\ni: 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. Correct.\n\nj: -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.\n\nk: 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.\n\nMagnitude squared: 8² + (-10)² + 4² = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. Correct. So sqrt(180) = sqrt(36*5) = 6√5. Then half of that is 3√5. That seems right.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle OAB is 3√5.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just check if there's another way to compute the area, maybe using coordinates of the points. Since O, A, and B are points in 3D space, with O at the origin, coordinates of A are (1,2,3) and coordinates of B are (-3,-2,1). The area of triangle OAB can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * || OA × OB ||\n\nWhich is exactly what we did. So, this confirms that the answer is 3√5.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that \\( t_n \\) satisfies the recurrence relation and relates to the Fibonacci sequence. For the golden ratio \\( \\phi \\), we know that \\( \\phi^n + (-\\phi)^{-n} = L_n \\), where \\( L_n \\) is the nth Lucas number. However, this might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the eigenvalues approach. The characteristic equation roots are complex and can be written in polar form.

However, since \\( \\phi \\) is real and greater than 1, the corresponding angle would be imaginary, leading to hyperbolic functions. This approach might not be helpful here.\n\nInstead, we can use the recurrence relation and periodicity.

The problem mentions medians AD, BE, and CF intersecting at the centroid G. Then, a line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. I need to find the area of triangleENG.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties about centroids and medians. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1.\n\nSince the line through G is parallel to BC and intersects AB at M and AC at N, triangleAMN should be similar to triangleABC because of the parallel lines. The ratio of similarity would be the ratio of the distances from the line MN to BC. But since MN is passing through G, which is the centroid, the distance from G to BC is one-third the height of ABC? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nThe centroid divides the median into 2:1, so if we consider the height of ABC, h, then the distance from G to BC would be h/3? Because from vertex A to BC is h, and the centroid is 2/3 of the way along the median from A to D. So the remaining 1/3 is from G to D? Wait, no. If the centroid is 2/3 along the median from the vertex, then the distance from the centroid to the base BC is 1/3 of the height. So yes, the distance from G to BC is h/3, and the distance from A to G is 2h/3.\n\nBut the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. So the distance between MN and BC is h/3. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between triangleAMN and ABC would be (h - h/3)/h = 2/3. Wait, but if MN is closer to BC, then triangleAMN is similar to ABC with a ratio of 1/3? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIf two lines are parallel, the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides. But first, I need to figure out the ratio of similarity. The line MN is at a height of h/3 from BC. Since the total height of ABC is h, the distance from MN to A is h - h/3 = 2h/3. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between AMN and ABC is (2h/3)/h = 2/3. Wait, but similarity ratio is the ratio of corresponding sides. So if AMN is similar to ABC with a ratio of 2/3, then their areas would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9. But the area of ABC is 144, so the area of AMN would be 4/9 * 144 = 64. Then, the area of AMN is 64. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the area of triangleENG. So maybe I need to find the coordinates of E, N, G, and then compute the area?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry could help here. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place triangleABC such that point B is at (0,0), C is at (2c,0), and A is at (0,2a), making BC horizontal. Then, the centroid G would be at ((0 + 0 + 2c)/3, (2a + 0 + 0)/3) = (2c/3, 2a/3). Wait, but if I place A at (0,2a), B at (0,0), and C at (2c,0), then the midpoint of BC is at (c,0), so the median from A is the line from (0,2a) to (c,0). The centroid G is located 2/3 along this median from A, so coordinates would be ( (2c/3), (2a/3) ). That makes sense.\n\nNow, the line through G parallel to BC. Since BC is horizontal from (0,0) to (2c,0), its slope is 0. Therefore, the line MN through G is horizontal, at the same y-coordinate as G, which is 2a/3. So MN is the horizontal line y = 2a/3. This line intersects AB and AC.\n\nFirst, find the equation of AB. Points A(0,2a) and B(0,0). Wait, AB is vertical? If A is at (0,2a) and B is at (0,0), then AB is the vertical line x=0. But then, the line y=2a/3 would intersect AB at (0, 2a/3). Wait, but the problem says that MN intersects AB at M and AC at N. If AB is vertical at x=0, then MN intersects AB at (0, 2a/3). But then, where does it intersect AC?\n\nPoint C is at (2c,0), so AC is the line from (0,2a) to (2c,0). Let's find the equation of AC. The slope is (0 - 2a)/(2c - 0) = -a/c. The equation is y - 2a = (-a/c)(x - 0), so y = (-a/c)x + 2a.\n\nThe line MN is y = 2a/3. To find the intersection point N with AC, set y = 2a/3 in the equation of AC:\n\n2a/3 = (-a/c)x + 2a\n\nSubtract 2a from both sides:\n\n2a/3 - 2a = (-a/c)x\n\nConvert 2a to 6a/3:\n\n2a/3 - 6a/3 = (-a/c)x\n\n-4a/3 = (-a/c)x\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n4a/3 = (a/c)x\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\n4/3 = x/c\n\nSo x = (4/3)c\n\nTherefore, point N is at (4c/3, 2a/3)\n\nBut wait, point C is at (2c,0), so 4c/3 is less than 2c, so that's okay. So MN intersects AB at M(0, 2a/3) and AC at N(4c/3, 2a/3).\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of E. E is the midpoint of AB. Wait, BE is the median from B to AC. Wait, the median BE connects B to the midpoint of AC. The midpoint of AC is ((0 + 2c)/2, (2a + 0)/2) = (c, a). So point E is at (c, a). Wait, no. Wait, BE is the median from B to AC. The median from B to AC would connect B(0,0) to the midpoint of AC. The midpoint of AC is (c, a), so the median BE is from (0,0) to (c,a). Therefore, point E is the midpoint of AC? Wait, no. Wait, the median from B is BE, which connects B to the midpoint of AC. So E is the midpoint of AC. Therefore, E is at ((0 + 2c)/2, (2a + 0)/2) = (c, a). Wait, but in the problem statement, it's called median BE and CF. So E is the midpoint of AC, and F is the midpoint of AB, and D is the midpoint of BC.\n\nWait, but in my coordinate system, midpoint of AB is (0, a), which is point F. Wait, no. Wait, if A is at (0,2a) and B at (0,0), then the midpoint of AB is (0, a). So point F is (0, a). Similarly, midpoint of AC is (c, a), which is point E. Midpoint of BC is (c, 0), which is point D.\n\nSo, BE is the median from B(0,0) to E(c, a). CF is the median from C(2c,0) to F(0,a). AD is the median from A(0,2a) to D(c,0). The centroid G is the intersection of these medians. As we calculated earlier, G is at (2c/3, 2a/3).\n\nNow, we need to find triangleENG. Points E, N, and G.\n\nPoint E is at (c, a).\n\nPoint N is at (4c/3, 2a/3).\n\nPoint G is at (2c/3, 2a/3).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nE: (c, a)\n\nN: (4c/3, 2a/3)\n\nG: (2c/3, 2a/3)\n\nTo find the area of triangleENG, we can use the shoelace formula.\n\nFirst, list the coordinates:\n\nE: (c, a)\n\nN: (4c/3, 2a/3)\n\nG: (2c/3, 2a/3)\n\nLet me write them as (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):\n\nx1 = c, y1 = a\n\nx2 = 4c/3, y2 = 2a/3\n\nx3 = 2c/3, y3 = 2a/3\n\nThe area is given by:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n= |[c*(2a/3 - 2a/3) + (4c/3)*(2a/3 - a) + (2c/3)*(a - 2a/3)] / 2|\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: c*(0) = 0\n\nSecond term: (4c/3)*(2a/3 - 3a/3) = (4c/3)*(-a/3) = -4ac/9\n\nThird term: (2c/3)*( (3a/3 - 2a/3) ) = (2c/3)*(a/3) = 2ac/9\n\nSo adding them up:\n\n0 - 4ac/9 + 2ac/9 = (-2ac/9)\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2:\n\n| (-2ac/9 ) / 2 | = | -ac/9 | = ac/9\n\nSo the area is ac/9.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of the area of ABC, which is 144. Let's find the relationship between ac and the area of ABC.\n\nIn our coordinate system, triangleABC has vertices at A(0,2a), B(0,0), and C(2c,0). The area of ABC can be calculated as the base times height / 2. The base BC is 2c, and the height is 2a (since A is at (0,2a)). So area = (2c * 2a)/2 = 2ac. So area of ABC is 2ac = 144, so 2ac = 144 => ac = 72.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangleENG is ac/9 = 72/9 = 8.\n\nWait, so the area is 8? Let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, coordinates:\n\n- A(0,2a), B(0,0), C(2c,0)\n\n- Centroid G(2c/3, 2a/3)\n\n- Line MN through G parallel to BC (horizontal line y=2a/3)\n\n- Intersection with AB (vertical line x=0) at M(0, 2a/3)\n\n- Intersection with AC at N(4c/3, 2a/3)\n\n- E is midpoint of AC: ((0 + 2c)/2, (2a + 0)/2) = (c, a)\n\nPoints E(c, a), N(4c/3, 2a/3), G(2c/3, 2a/3)\n\nCalculating area via shoelace:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nE: (c, a)\n\nN: (4c/3, 2a/3)\n\nG: (2c/3, 2a/3)\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nFirst term: c*(2a/3 - 2a/3) = 0\n\nSecond term: (4c/3)*(2a/3 - a) = (4c/3)*(-a/3) = -4ac/9\n\nThird term: (2c/3)*(a - 2a/3) = (2c/3)*(a/3) = 2ac/9\n\nSum: -4ac/9 + 2ac/9 = -2ac/9\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2: | -2ac/9 | /2 = ac/9\n\nSince area of ABC is 2ac = 144 => ac =72\n\nThus, area of triangleENG is 72/9 = 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{8}\n</think>\n\nGiven a triangle \\(ABC\\) with an area of 144, we need to find the area of triangle \\(ENG\\) where \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), \\(N\\) is the intersection of a line through the centroid \\(G\\) (parallel to \\(BC\\)) with \\(AC\\), and \\(G\\) is the centroid of \\(ABC\\).\n\n1. **Coordinates Setup**:\n   - Place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 2a)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), and \\(C\\) at \\((2c, 0)\\).\n   - The centroid \\(G\\) is at \\(\\left(\\frac{2c}{3}, \\frac{2a}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Line through \\(G\\) parallel to \\(BC**:\n   - Since \\(BC\\) is horizontal, the line through \\(G\\) is horizontal at \\(y = \\frac{2a}{3}\\).\n   - This line intersects \\(AB\\) (vertical line \\(x = 0\\)) at \\(M(0, \\frac{2a}{3})\\) and \\(AC\\) at \\(N\\left(\\frac{4c}{3}, \\frac{2a}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Coordinates of Points**:\n   - \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), so \\(E\\) is at \\((c, a)\\).\n   - \\(N\\) is at \\(\\left(\\frac{4c}{3}, \\frac{2a}{3}\\right)\\).\n   - \\(G\\) is at \\(\\left(\\frac{2c}{3", "answer": "8"}

The problem is about a library with three shelves. The total number of books is 24. The top shelf has 8 mystery books, the middle shelf has 10 math books, and the bottom shelf has 6 science books. Then, two books are removed from each shelf. We need to find the fraction of the remaining books that are math books. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many books are left on each shelf after removing two from each. The top shelf originally has 8 books. If two are taken away, that leaves 8 - 2 = 6 books. The middle shelf starts with 10 math books. Subtracting two gives 10 - 2 = 8 math books remaining. The bottom shelf has 6 science books, so removing two leaves 6 - 2 = 4 science books. \n\nNow, let's check if the total number of books after removal makes sense. The top shelf has 6, middle has 8, bottom has 4. Adding those together: 6 + 8 + 4 = 18. Originally, there were 24 books. Removing two from each of the three shelves means removing a total of 2 * 3 = 6 books. So 24 - 6 = 18, which matches the total after removal. That checks out.\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of the remaining books that are math books. The math books remaining are 8. The total remaining books are 18. So the fraction is 8 out of 18. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The GCD of 8 and 18 is 2. Dividing both by 2 gives 4/9. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. 8 divided by 2 is 4, and 18 divided by 2 is 9. Yes, that's correct. So the simplified fraction is 4/9. \n\nBut let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original counts per shelf: top 8, middle 10, bottom 6. Total 24. After removing two from each: 6, 8, 4. Total 18. Math books left are 8. So 8/18 simplifies to 4/9. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The problem says \"quelle fraction des livres restants sur les trois étagže sont des livres de mathématiques\". So they want the fraction of the remaining books that are math books. Yes, so math books after removal: 10 - 2 = 8. Total remaining: 24 - 6 = 18. So 8/18. Simplify to 4/9. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations. The key steps were subtracting two from each shelf's original count, summing the remaining books, and then finding the proportion that are math books. Simplifying the fraction was straightforward once we had the numbers. So the answer should be 4/9.\n</think>\n\nThe library initially has 24 books distributed as follows: 8 mystery on the top shelf, 10 math on the middle shelf, and 6 science on the bottom shelf. After removing two books from each shelf, the remaining books are calculated as:\n\n- Top shelf: \\(8 - 2 = 6\\)\n- Middle shelf: \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) (math books remain)\n- Bottom shelf: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\)\n\nTotal remaining books: \\(6 + 8 + 4 = 18\\). The fraction of math books is \\(\\frac{8}{18}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}}\\)", "answer": "\\frac{4}{9}"}

The problem says the area of the base is 30 square units and the height is 6.5 units. Hmm, okay, so I just need to plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. It's one-third of the base area multiplied by the height. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I substitute B with 30 and h with 6.5, then V should be (1/3)*30*6.5.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. First, multiply 30 by 6.5. Let's see, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. So adding those together, 180 + 15 = 195. Then, multiply that by 1/3. So 195 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 3 goes into 19 five times (5*3=15), subtract 15 from 19, we get 4. Bring down the 5 to make 45. 3 goes into 45 fifteen times. So 195 divided by 3 is 65. Therefore, the volume should be 65 cubic units.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure. 30 times 6.5 is indeed 195. Then 195 divided by 3 is 65. Yeah, that seems correct. So the volume is 65 cubic units. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula is straightforward, and plugging in the numbers step by step gives me 65.

The problem is about an arithmetic sequence. They say that the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. I need to find the sixth term. Hmm, arithmetic sequences... right, they are sequences where each term increases by a constant difference. So, the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nAlright, so the fourth term is 200. That would be a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200. And the eighth term is 500, so a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500. Now, I need to find the sixth term, which is a_6 = a_1 + 5d. \n\nHmm, maybe I can set up equations using the given terms and solve for a_1 and d first. Let's write down the equations:\n\n1. a_1 + 3d = 200\n2. a_1 + 7d = 500\n\nIf I subtract the first equation from the second, that should eliminate a_1 and give me the difference in terms of d. Let's try that:\n\n(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\nSimplifying the left side: a_1 + 7d - a_1 - 3d = 4d\n\nRight side: 300\n\nSo, 4d = 300. Therefore, d = 300 / 4 = 75. Okay, so the common difference is 75.\n\nNow, plug back d = 75 into one of the original equations to find a_1. Let's use the first equation:\n\na_1 + 3*75 = 200\n\n3*75 is 225. So, a_1 + 225 = 200. Therefore, a_1 = 200 - 225 = -25. So, the first term is -25.\n\nNow, let's check if this makes sense. If a_1 is -25 and d is 75, then:\n\na_1 = -25\n\na_2 = -25 + 75 = 50\n\na_3 = 50 + 75 = 125\n\na_4 = 125 + 75 = 200. Okay, that matches the given fourth term.\n\nThen a_5 = 200 + 75 = 275\n\na_6 = 275 + 75 = 350\n\na_7 = 350 + 75 = 425\n\na_8 = 425 + 75 = 500. That also matches the given eighth term. So, the calculations check out.\n\nTherefore, the sixth term is 350. Let me just make sure there's no other way to approach this problem. Maybe using the terms directly?\n\nAlternatively, since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between terms is constant. The fourth term is 200, the eighth term is 500. The difference between the fourth and eighth term is 500 - 200 = 300 over 4 steps (from term 4 to term 8). So, each step is 300 / 4 = 75, which is the common difference. Then, moving from term 4 to term 6 is two steps. So, 200 + 2*75 = 200 + 150 = 350. Yep, same result. That's a quicker way if you can visualize the terms on the number line.\n\nSo, either way, whether solving for a_1 and d or using the difference between terms, we get the sixth term as 350. I think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations. All steps make sense. So, the answer should be 350.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sixth term is \\boxed{350}.\n</think>\n\nGiven an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500, we need to find the sixth term.\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\]\n\nWe know:\n\\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \\]\n\\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \\]\n\\[ 4d = 300 \\]\n\\[ d = 75 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( d = 75 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[ a_1 + 3 \\cdot 75 = 200 \\]\n\\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = -25 \\]\n\nNow, we find the sixth term:\n\\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \\]\n\\[ a_6 = -25 + 5 \\cdot 75 \\]\n\\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \\]\n\\[ a_6 = 350 \\]\n\nThus, the sixth term is \\(\\boxed{350}\\).", "answer": "350"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that fractions can be converted to decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator. But the denominator here is a product of powers of 2 and 5, which makes me think that maybe there's a smarter way than just doing long division.\n\nWait, right! Fractions whose denominators are only composed of 2s and 5s can be converted to finite decimals. Because 10 is 2 times 5, and multiplying by powers of 10 shifts the decimal. So, if I can adjust the denominator to be a power of 10 by multiplying numerator and denominator by the necessary factors, that should work.\n\nLet me check the denominator: it's 2 squared times 5 to the seventh power. So, 2² * 5⁷. To make the denominator a power of 10, I need the exponents of 2 and 5 to be equal because 10ⁿ = (2*5)ⁿ. Here, the exponent of 5 is higher (7) than the exponent of 2 (2). So, I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by 2⁵ to make the exponent of 2 equal to 7. That way, the denominator becomes 2⁷ * 5⁷ = 10⁷.\n\nLet me verify that. Original denominator: 2² * 5⁷. Multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵: new numerator is 21 * 2⁵, new denominator is 2² * 2⁵ * 5⁷ = 2⁷ * 5⁷. Yes, that works. So then, the fraction becomes (21 * 2⁵) / 10⁷.\n\nNow, calculate 21 * 2⁵. Let's compute 2⁵ first. 2⁵ is 32. Then 21 * 32. Let me do that multiplication. 20*32=640, and 1*32=32, so 640+32=672. So the numerator is 672, and the denominator is 10⁷, which is 10,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 672 / 10,000,000. To convert this to a decimal, since the denominator is 10⁷, we can just place the numerator in the decimal with seven decimal places. So, 672 becomes 0.0000672.\n\nWait, let me check that. 10⁷ is 1 followed by seven zeros, so 10,000,000. So, 672 divided by 10,000,000 is moving the decimal point seven places to the left. Starting from 672, which is 672.0, moving the decimal seven places left: 6.72 becomes 0.672, then 0.0672, 0.00672, 0.000672, 0.0000672. Yes, that's seven places. So, the decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation steps to be sure. Original fraction: 21/(2²*5⁷). Calculated 2⁵=32, 21*32=672. So, 672 divided by 10⁷. 10⁷ is 10,000,000. So, 672/10,000,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do the division directly? Let's see. 21 divided by (2²*5⁷). First, compute the denominator: 2² is 4, 5⁷ is 78125. So, 4*78125. Let me compute that. 78125 * 4: 78125*2=156250, so times 2 again is 312500. So denominator is 312500. Then 21 divided by 312500. Let's do that division.\n\n21 ÷ 312500. Hmm, 312500 goes into 21 zero times. Add a decimal point and some zeros. 312500 goes into 210 zero times, 2100 zero times, 21000 zero times, 210000 six times because 312500*6=187500. Subtract 187500 from 210000, get 22500. Bring down the next zero: 225000. 312500 goes into 225000 zero times. Next zero: 2250000. 312500*7=2187500. Subtract from 2250000: 62500. Bring down the next zero: 625000. 312500 goes into 625000 exactly two times. So, the decimal is 0.0000672. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo, converting the fraction to a decimal gives 0.0000672. Let me just confirm once more that I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. The original denominator is 2² * 5⁷. By multiplying numerator and denominator by 2⁵, we get 2⁷ *5⁷ in the denominator, which is 10⁷, correct. Then numerator becomes 21*32=672, correct. So the decimal is 672/10,000,000 = 0.0000672. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. Just to recap: when the denominator is a product of 2s and 5s, we can adjust the fraction to have a denominator of 10^n, which gives a finite decimal. Since the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator are 2 and 7, respectively, we multiply by 2^5 to balance the exponents. Then, the decimal is just the numerator (after multiplication) divided by 10^n, which translates to moving the decimal point left by n places. All steps check out, so the final answer should be 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) into a finite decimal, we first balance the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator.

{"original_question": "Combien d'entiers positifs à deux chiffres sont des facteurs à la fois de 100 et de 150 ?", "question": "Combien d'entiers positifs à deux chiffres sont des facteurs à la fois de 100 et de 150 ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150. So, I need to find numbers between 10 and 99 inclusive that divide both 100 and 150 without leaving a remainder. Hmm, factors common to both numbers. That sounds like I need to find the common divisors of 100 and 150, specifically the two-digit ones. \n\nFirst, maybe I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 because the common factors would be the divisors of the GCD. Let me recall how to compute the GCD. The prime factorization method might work here. Let's break down both numbers into their prime factors.\n\nStarting with 100. 100 divided by 2 is 50, divided by 2 again is 25. Then 25 divided by 5 is 5, and divided by 5 again is 1. So the prime factors of 100 are 2² × 5².\n\nNow for 150. 150 divided by 2 is 75. 75 divided by 3 is 25, then 25 divided by 5 is 5, and divided by 5 again is 1. So the prime factors of 150 are 2¹ × 3¹ × 5².\n\nTo find the GCD, we take the lowest power of each common prime factor. The common primes here are 2 and 5. For 2, the lowest power is 2¹, and for 5, it's 5². Wait, hold on. Wait, 100 has 2² and 150 has 2¹. So the minimum exponent is 1. For 5, both have 5². So GCD is 2¹ × 5² = 2 × 25 = 50. So the greatest common divisor is 50. Therefore, all common divisors of 100 and 150 are the divisors of 50.\n\nNow, I need to list all the divisors of 50 and then check which ones are two-digit numbers. Let's list them out. The divisors of 50 are the numbers that can divide 50 without leaving a remainder. Starting from 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. Let me verify that. 50 divided by 1 is 50, 50 divided by 2 is 25, 50 divided by 5 is 10, 50 divided by 10 is 5, 50 divided by 25 is 2, and 50 divided by 50 is 1. So those are all the divisors.\n\nNow, among these divisors, which ones are two-digit numbers? Let's see. The list is 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. The single-digit numbers are 1, 2, 5. The two-digit numbers are 10, 25, 50. So that's three numbers: 10, 25, 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. 10 is two digits, yes. 25 is two digits, 50 is two digits. So that's three numbers. So the answer should be 3. But let me make sure there aren't any other two-digit divisors that I might have missed. Let me list all the divisors again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list all the factors of 50 systematically. The divisors of a number can be found by checking numbers from 1 up to the square root of the number and seeing if they divide it. For 50, the square root is approximately 7.07. So we check numbers from 1 to 7. \n\n1 divides 50. 2 divides 50. 5 divides 50. 7? 50 divided by 7 is about 7.14, which is not an integer, so 7 is not a divisor. Then the corresponding higher divisors would be 50/1=50, 50/2=25, 50/5=10, and since we already checked up to 7, the next divisor would be 10, which we already have. So yes, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.\n\nTherefore, the two-digit divisors are 10, 25, and 50. So three in total. Therefore, the answer should be 3. But let me confirm by checking if each of these numbers indeed divides both 100 and 150.\n\nStarting with 10. 100 divided by 10 is 10, which is an integer. 150 divided by 10 is 15, also an integer. So 10 is a common divisor. \n\nNext, 25. 100 divided by 25 is 4, which is an integer. 150 divided by 25 is 6, which is an integer. So 25 is also a common divisor.\n\nThen, 50. 100 divided by 50 is 2, and 150 divided by 50 is 3. Both are integers, so 50 is a common divisor.\n\nSo all three numbers are indeed common divisors of 100 and 150. Therefore, the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is 3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other two-digit numbers that divide both 100 and 150. For example, is there a number like 20? Let's check 20. 100 divided by 20 is 5, which is okay, but 150 divided by 20 is 7.5, which is not an integer. So 20 is not a divisor of 150. Similarly, 25 is okay, but 20 isn't. How about 15? 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666, which is not an integer. 150 divided by 15 is 10, which is okay, but since 15 doesn't divide 100, it's not a common divisor. \n\nAnother number, 40. 100 divided by 40 is 2.5, not an integer. 150 divided by 40 is 3.75. Not an integer. So 40 is out. How about 50? We already have 50. \n\nWhat about 25? Wait, 25 is already accounted for. So maybe there's no other two-digit numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list all two-digit numbers and check, but that's time-consuming. But since we know the GCD is 50, and the divisors of 50 are only 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, then the two-digit ones are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these numbers. \n\nFirst, we compute the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:\n- \\(100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(150 = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) is found by taking the lowest power of each common prime factor:\n- The common prime factors are 2 and 5.\n- The lowest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n- The lowest power of 5 is \\(5^2\\).\n\nThus, the GCD is \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 = 2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n\nNext, we list the divisors of 50:\n- The divisors of 50 are \\(1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\\).\n\nAmong these, the two-digit divisors are \\(10, 25,\\) and \\(50\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).", "answer": "3"}

Hmm, let me start by recalling what a perfect nth power means. If a number x is a perfect nth power, then there exists some integer k such that x = kⁿ. So in this case, 2²⁴ should be equal to kⁿ for some integer k. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of integers n > 1 such that 2²⁴ is a perfect nth power. That means we need to find all n > 1 for which there exists some integer k where kⁿ = 2²⁴. \n\nLet me think. Since 2²⁴ is a power of 2, k must also be a power of 2. Let's let k = 2^m for some integer m. Then substituting into the equation kⁿ = 2²⁴ gives (2^m)ⁿ = 2²⁴. Using exponent rules, this simplifies to 2^(m*n) = 2²⁴. Therefore, m*n = 24. \n\nSo now the problem reduces to finding the number of integers n > 1 such that there exists an integer m where m*n = 24. But m has to be a positive integer as well because k = 2^m must be a positive integer. Therefore, m and n are positive integers with m*n = 24, and n > 1. \n\nWait, but m can be any positive integer such that n = 24/m is also an integer. So n must be a divisor of 24. But since n > 1, we need to find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. \n\nBut hold on, not exactly. Because m has to be a positive integer as well. So for each divisor n of 24 (with n > 1), m = 24/n must also be a positive integer. Therefore, n must divide 24. So the possible values of n are the divisors of 24 greater than 1. \n\nBut let me check. For example, take n = 2. Then m = 24/2 = 12. So k = 2^12 = 4096. Then 4096² = (2^12)² = 2^24, which works. \n\nSimilarly, n = 3: m = 24/3 = 8. So k = 2^8 = 256. Then 256³ = 2^(8*3) = 2^24, which is correct. \n\nSimilarly, n = 4: m = 6. k = 2^6 = 64. 64^4 = 2^24. Yep. \n\nContinuing this way, n must divide 24, and n > 1. So the number of such n is equal to the number of divisors of 24 minus 1 (since we exclude n = 1). \n\nBut let me verify. First, let's find all divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is 2³ * 3¹. The number of divisors is (3 + 1)*(1 + 1) = 4*2 = 8. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \n\nSince n > 1, we exclude 1, so there are 7 divisors. Therefore, there are 7 possible values of n. But wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, but does each divisor n of 24 correspond to a valid k? Since k = 2^(24/n), which is an integer because 24/n is an integer (since n divides 24). Therefore, for each divisor n > 1 of 24, there exists such a k. Therefore, the number of integers n > 1 is equal to the number of divisors of 24 minus 1 (excluding n = 1). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me list all the divisors of 24 again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So excluding 1, we have 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 7 numbers. Each of these n would make 2²⁴ a perfect nth power. \n\nFor example, n = 24: then k = 2^(24/24) = 2^1 = 2. So 2^24 = 2^24, which is trivially true. But the problem states n > 1, so 24 is allowed. Similarly, n = 12: k = 2^(24/12) = 2² = 4, so 4¹² = 2²⁴. That works. \n\nTherefore, all divisors of 24 greater than 1 are valid. Since there are 7 such divisors, the answer is 7. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Suppose we approach this problem by considering the exponents. Since 2²⁴ is a perfect nth power, then 24 must be divisible by n. Because the exponent in a perfect nth power must be a multiple of n. Wait, is that correct? \n\nWait, if a number is a perfect nth power, then in its prime factorization, all exponents must be multiples of n. In this case, the prime factorization of 2²⁴ is just 2²⁴. So the exponent here is 24. Therefore, for 2²⁴ to be a perfect nth power, 24 must be divisible by n. So n must be a divisor of 24. But n > 1. Therefore, the number of such n is the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1, which is 7. \n\nSo that's another way to see it. Since the exponent 24 must be divisible by n, so n divides 24, and n > 1. Hence, the number is 7. \n\nTherefore, both approaches agree. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let's test n = 5. If n = 5, then 2²⁴ is a perfect 5th power. That would mean there exists an integer k such that k⁵ = 2²⁴. But 2²⁴ = (2⁴.8)⁵? Wait, no. Let's see. 24 divided by 5 is 4.8, which is not an integer. So k would have to be 2^(24/5), which is not an integer. Therefore, n = 5 is not allowed. \n\nSimilarly, n = 7: 24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.428..., which is not an integer, so k would not be an integer. Therefore, n must divide 24. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 7. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of such integers \\( n \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) satisfy the condition that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, we need to find the number of integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that there exists an integer \\( k \\) where \\( k^n = 2^{24} \\).\n\nSince \\( 2^{24} \\) is a power of 2, \\( k \\) must also be a power of 2.

Combien de nickels a-t-elle ?", "question": "Hillary a onze pièces, toutes des dimes et des nickels. Au total, les pièces valent 75 cents. Combien de nickels a-t-elle ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Hillary having eleven coins, all dimes and nickels, totaling 75 cents. The question is how many nickels she has. Hmm, so I need to figure out the number of nickels. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dimes are worth 10 cents each and nickels are worth 5 cents each. The total number of coins is 11, and the total amount is 75 cents. So, if I let the number of dimes be, say, D and the number of nickels be N, then I can set up some equations here.\n\nThe first equation would be about the total number of coins. Since she has 11 coins in total, that means D plus N equals 11. So:\n\nD + N = 11\n\nThen, the second equation is about the total value. Each dime is 10 cents, so the value from dimes is 10D cents. Similarly, each nickel is 5 cents, so the value from nickels is 5N cents. Together, these add up to 75 cents. Therefore:\n\n10D + 5N = 75\n\nOkay, so now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nI need to solve this system to find the number of nickels, which is N. Let me think about how to solve this. There are a couple of methods: substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express D in terms of N. Let's do that. If D + N = 11, then D = 11 - N. So, D is 11 minus the number of nickels. Then, I can substitute this expression for D into the second equation. That way, the second equation will only have one variable, N. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting D = 11 - N into the second equation:\n\n10*(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\nNow, let's compute this step by step. First, distribute the 10 into (11 - N):\n\n10*11 = 110\n10*(-N) = -10N\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75\n\nCombine like terms. The terms with N are -10N and +5N. So:\n\n-10N + 5N = -5N\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n110 - 5N = 75\n\nNow, let's solve for N. Subtract 110 from both sides:\n\n-5N = 75 - 110\n-5N = -35\n\nThen, divide both sides by -5:\n\nN = (-35)/(-5)\nN = 7\n\nSo, N equals 7. Therefore, there are 7 nickels. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 7 nickels, then the number of dimes would be 11 - 7 = 4 dimes. Let's calculate the total value:\n\n4 dimes * 10 cents = 40 cents\n7 nickels * 5 cents = 35 cents\n40 + 35 = 75 cents\n\nYes, that adds up to 75 cents. So, that checks out. Therefore, the number of nickels is 7.\n\nWait, let me think again if there's another way to approach this. Sometimes, problems like this can be solved by considering the total amount and the difference in value. For example, if all 11 coins were nickels, then the total would be 11 * 5 = 55 cents. But we have 75 cents, which is 20 cents more. Since a dime is 5 cents more than a nickel, each time we replace a nickel with a dime, the total increases by 5 cents. So, how many replacements do we need to get an increase of 20 cents?\n\n20 cents / 5 cents per replacement = 4 replacements. So, replace 4 nickels with dimes. Therefore, the number of dimes is 4, and the number of nickels is 11 - 4 = 7. Same answer. So, that confirms it again. So, 7 nickels.\n\nAlternatively, another method: Let's say all coins are nickels. Then the total would be 55 cents. The actual total is 75 cents, which is 20 cents more. Each dime adds an extra 5 cents compared to a nickel. So, the number of dimes is 20 / 5 = 4. Hence, 4 dimes and 7 nickels. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, all methods lead to 7 nickels. That seems solid. Therefore, the answer must be 7. But just to be thorough, let's try plugging in the numbers again. If there are 7 nickels (35 cents) and 4 dimes (40 cents), total is 75. Correct. So, yeah, that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of nickels is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the number of dimes and \\( N \\) be the number of nickels. We know the following:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   D + N = 11\n   \\]\n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents:\n   \\[\n   10D + 5N = 75\n   \\]\n\nFirst, solve for \\( D \\) from the first equation:\n\\[\nD = 11 - N\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( D = 11 - N \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\\]\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\\[\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75\n\\]\n\\[\n110 - 5N = 75\n\\]\n\\[\n-5N = 75 - 110\n\\]\n\\[\n-5N = -35\n\\]\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-35}{-5} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of nickels is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).", "answer": "7"}

Quelle est la probabilité que la somme des nombres qu'ils choisissent soit paire ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so Paul and Jesse each pick a number at random from the first six prime numbers. We need to find the probability that the sum of their numbers is even. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the first six prime numbers are. \n\nPrimes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Wait, hold on, 2 is the first prime, then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Yep, that's correct. So each of them is picking one of these six numbers, right?\n\nNow, the problem is about the sum being even. I remember that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. If one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd. So, to get an even sum, they either both pick even numbers or both pick odd numbers. \n\nBut looking at the first six primes: 2 is the only even prime here. All the others (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd. So there's only one even number (2) and five odd numbers. That makes things a bit simpler. \n\nSo, Paul and Jesse each have six choices. The total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. That's the denominator of our probability. Now, the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. \n\nSince the only even prime is 2, the cases where the sum is even are:\n\n1. Both Paul and Jesse pick an even number (which can only be 2).\n2. Both Paul and Jesse pick an odd number (any of the remaining five primes).\n\nLet's calculate these two cases separately.\n\nFirst case: Both pick 2. The probability for Paul to pick 2 is 1/6, and the same for Jesse. Since they pick independently, the probability is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nSecond case: Both pick odd numbers. There are five odd numbers. So the probability that Paul picks an odd number is 5/6, and the same for Jesse. So the probability for both picking odd is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n\nAdding these two cases together gives the total probability: 1/36 + 25/36 = 26/36. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 13/18.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. So total possible outcomes are 36. Number of favorable outcomes: for both even, only 1 (Paul picks 2 and Jesse picks 2). For both odd, there are 5 options for Paul and 5 for Jesse, so 25. So total favorable outcomes are 1 + 25 = 26. Therefore, probability is 26/36, which reduces to 13/18. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: The sum is even if both are even or both are odd. Since there's only one even number, the probability that both pick even is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36. The probability that both pick odd is (5/6)(5/6) = 25/36. So adding them gives 26/36 = 13/18. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the answer should be 13/18. Let me check if there's any other possible way they could get an even sum. If one picks even and the other odd, the sum is odd. Since 2 is the only even prime, that can't happen here. So all other combinations where one is even (which is only 2) and the other is odd would result in an odd sum, but since there's only one even number, those cases aren't possible. Wait, actually, if Paul picks 2 (even) and Jesse picks an odd number, the sum is odd + even = odd. Similarly, if Jesse picks 2 and Paul picks odd, the sum is still odd. So indeed, the only way to get an even sum is both even or both odd. Since there's only one even number, the both even case is only 1 outcome. The both odd case is 5*5=25. So 26 favorable out of 36. 26 divided by 36 reduces to 13/18. So yes, that's the probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum is even is 13/18.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}}.\n</think>\n\nPaul and Jesse each pick a number at random from the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The only even prime number is 2, and the rest (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.\n\n1. **Both pick even numbers:**\n   - There is only one even number (2).\n   - The probability that Paul picks 2 is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n   - The probability that Jesse picks 2 is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n   - The combined probability is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\n2. **Both pick odd numbers:**\n   - There are five odd numbers.\n   - The probability that Paul picks an odd number is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n   - The probability that Jesse picks an odd number is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n   - The combined probability is \\(\\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{25}{36}\\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together gives the total probability of an even sum:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{26}{36} = \\frac{13}{18}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}}\\).", "answer": "\\frac{13}{18}"}

I need to find the value of b when the point (a, b) is on the line 3x + 2y = 12 and a is 4. Hmm, so the line equation is 3x plus 2y equals 12. Since the point (a, b) is on this line, substituting x with a and y with b should satisfy the equation. The problem says when a is 4, what is b. So, I guess I just plug in a = 4 into the equation and solve for b. Let me check if that's right.\n\nSo, substituting x with 4 in the equation 3x + 2y = 12. That would be 3*(4) + 2y = 12. Let me compute 3 times 4, which is 12. So, the equation becomes 12 + 2y = 12. Then, subtract 12 from both sides to solve for y. Wait, but here y is b, right? So, 12 + 2y = 12. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2y = 0. Then divide both sides by 2: y = 0. So, b would be 0? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write the equation again step by step. Starting with 3x + 2y = 12. Given that a = 4, which is the x-coordinate. So, x is 4. Therefore, substitute x with 4: 3*4 + 2y = 12. 3*4 is indeed 12. So, 12 + 2y = 12. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2y = 0. Then, divide by 2: y = 0. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, b is 0.\n\nWait, but let me visualize the line. The equation 3x + 2y = 12. If I convert this to slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + c, then I can see the y-intercept. Let's do that. Starting with 3x + 2y = 12. Subtract 3x from both sides: 2y = -3x + 12. Then divide by 2: y = (-3/2)x + 6. So, the line has a slope of -3/2 and a y-intercept at (0, 6). If a is 4, that's x = 4. So, plugging x = 4 into the equation gives y = (-3/2)*4 + 6. Let's compute that. (-3/2)*4 is -6. Then, -6 + 6 is 0. So, y = 0. Yep, that matches the previous result. So, b is indeed 0. So, the answer should be 0.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if the point (4, 0) actually lies on the line 3x + 2y = 12. Let's plug in x = 4 and y = 0. 3*4 is 12, 2*0 is 0. 12 + 0 = 12, which equals the right-hand side. So, yes, that works. Therefore, when a is 4, b is 0. So, the value of b is 0.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. Both substitution methods give the same result, and checking the point confirms it's on the line.

The problem says that twelve 1x1 squares form a rectangle, as illustrated. We need to find the total area of the shaded region. Hmm. Since all the squares are 1x1, each has an area of 1, right? So twelve of them would make a rectangle with area 12. But the question is about the shaded parts. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the Asymptote figure. The code mentions a grid from (0,0) to (3,4), maybe? Let me parse the Asymptote code. It draws a grid with vertical lines from 0 to 3 and horizontal lines from 0 to 4. The shaded regions are two triangles: one from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), and another from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). There's also some diagonals drawn: (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). \n\nSo the rectangle must be 3 units wide and 4 units tall, since the vertical lines go up to 4 and the horizontal lines span 0 to 3. That makes sense because 3x4 is 12 squares. The first shaded area is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The second shaded area is another triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). \n\nLet me confirm the coordinates. The first triangle is from the top-left corner (0,4) down to the bottom-left (0,0), and then over to (2,0). So that's a right triangle with base along the left side from (0,0) to (2,0), which is 2 units, and height from (0,0) to (0,4), which is 4 units. Wait, but in a triangle area, the formula is (base * height)/2. So if the base is 2 and the height is 4, the area would be (2*4)/2 = 4. \n\nThe second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). That's a right triangle as well. The base is from (3,4) down to (3,0), which is 4 units, and the height is from (3,0) to (0,0), which is 3 units. Wait, but actually, the base here is vertical from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units, and the height is horizontal from (3,0) to (0,0), which is 3 units. But when calculating the area of a right triangle, it's (base * height)/2. So here, base and height are 4 and 3, so area is (4*3)/2 = 6. \n\nSo adding the two shaded areas together: 4 + 6 = 10. But wait, the entire rectangle is 12 units. So if the shaded areas are 10, then the unshaded would be 2, but that might not be necessary here. However, the problem just asks for the total area of the shaded region, which would be 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the triangles. Let's look again. \n\nFirst triangle: (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). So this is a triangle with vertices at the top-left corner, the bottom-left corner, and a point two units over on the bottom. So this is a right triangle with legs of length 4 (from (0,4) to (0,0)) and 2 (from (0,0) to (2,0)). So area is (4*2)/2 = 4. That's correct. \n\nSecond triangle: (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). This is a triangle with vertices at the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right. So this is a right triangle with legs of length 3 (from (3,4) to (3,0)) and 4 (from (3,0) to (0,0)), but wait, actually, the horizontal leg is from (3,0) to (0,0), which is 3 units, and the vertical leg is from (0,0) to (0,4), but the triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). Wait, no. The triangle is (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So the base is from (3,4) to (3,0), which is vertical, 4 units. The other side is from (3,0) to (0,4). Hmm, that's a diagonal. Wait, but is that a right triangle? Let me see. If you connect (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0), then the sides are vertical (3,4) to (3,0) which is 4 units, horizontal (0,4) to (3,4) which is 3 units, and then the hypotenuse from (0,4) to (3,0). Wait, but the triangle is (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). So the two legs are 3 and 4, making it a 3-4-5 triangle. So area is (3*4)/2 = 6. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if you consider the coordinates, the base can be the vertical side from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units, and the height is the horizontal distance from (3,0) to (0,4), which is 3 units. But actually, in a right triangle, the legs are perpendicular. Here, the vertical leg is 4 units, and the horizontal leg is 3 units, so area is indeed 6. \n\nTherefore, adding 4 + 6 gives 10. But wait, let me check again. The problem says twelve 1x1 squares form the rectangle. If the rectangle is 3x4, that's 12 squares. The shaded areas are two triangles each made of some squares? Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the shaded regions are filled areas, so they are full triangles, not necessarily made up of half-squares. \n\nSo each shaded triangle's area is calculated as 4 and 6, totaling 10. But 10 is less than 12, which makes sense. So the answer should be 10. \n\nBut let me visualize again. The first triangle is on the left side, from (0,4) down to (0,0), then over to (2,0). The second triangle is on the right side, from (0,4) up to (3,4), then down to (3,0). The overlapping area? Wait, do these triangles overlap? Let me see. The first triangle is from the left side, the second from the top right. They might not overlap. Let's check if there is any intersection. The first triangle has vertices at (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). The second triangle has vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). The only common point is (0,4). So they don't overlap. Therefore, the total shaded area is indeed 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Wait, the Asymptote code draws a grid from (0,0) to (3,4). So the rectangle is 3 units in width (from x=0 to x=3) and 4 units in height (from y=0 to y=4). The shaded regions are two triangles: one on the left side, and one on the right side. \n\nWait, but if the rectangle is 3x4, the area is 12. The two shaded triangles have areas 4 and 6, summing to 10. So unless there's another shaded region, but the problem says \"la Supermane surface de la forma\" which translates to \"the total surface area of the shaded region\". So if there are only those two triangles, then 10 is the answer. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe the Asymptote code draws more shaded areas? The code says: \n\nfill((0, 4)--(0, 0)--(2, 0)--cycle, gray(0.75));\nfill((0, 4)--(3, 4)--(3, 0)--cycle, gray(0.75));\n\nSo only two filled regions. The first is the triangle from (0,4) down to (0,0) then to (2,0). The second is the triangle from (0,4) up to (3,4) then down to (3,0). So those are the only two shaded areas. \n\nTherefore, their areas are 4 and 6, totaling 10. So the answer is 10. \n\nBut wait, the problem statement mentions \"douze carrés de 1 par 1\", which is twelve 1x1 squares, forming a rectangle. So the rectangle must be 3x4, since 3*4=12. Then the shaded regions are parts of that rectangle. So the answer is 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in French? The original user message is in English, but the Asymptote code is from a problem that might have been in French, given the coordinate labels. But regardless, the calculation seems straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded areas are not both triangles. Wait, let's look at the Asymptote code again. The first fill is (0,4)--(0,0)--(2,0)--cycle. That is a triangle. The second fill is (0,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--cycle, which is also a triangle. So two triangles. \n\nCalculating their areas. First triangle: base=2, height=4. Area= (2*4)/2=4. Second triangle: base=4, height=3. Wait, no. Wait, the second triangle's base is from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units. The height is from (3,0) to (0,0), which is 3 units. So area=(4*3)/2=6. So total shaded area=4+6=10. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10. \n\nBut let me check once again, perhaps I made a mistake in coordinates. Let's plot the points. \n\nFirst triangle: (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). So starting at top-left corner (0,4), down to bottom-left (0,0), then right to (2,0). So this is a right triangle with legs along the left side (4 units) and the base (2 units). Area 4. \n\nSecond triangle: (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). Starting at top-left (0,4), right to top-right (3,4), then down to (3,0). This is a right triangle with legs along the top (3 units) and the right side (4 units). So area=(3*4)/2=6. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 4 + 6 = 10. \n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the shaded region is 10. So the answer is \\boxed{10}. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}\n</think>\n\nThe problem states that twelve 1x1 squares form a rectangle, and we need to find the total area of the shaded region.

{"original_question": "Quel est le plus petit multiple positif de 450 dont les chiffres sont tous des zéros et des uns ?", "question": "Quel est le plus petit multiple positif de 450 dont les chiffres sont tous des zéros et des uns ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. A multiple of 450 means the number has to be divisible by 450. And the digits can only be 0s or 1s. So, the number should look like a combination of 1s and 0s, but not starting with a 0, of course. The goal is the smallest such number.\n\nFirst, let's recall that 450 factors into prime factors. Let me do that. 450 divided by 2 is 225. Then 225 is 15 squared, which is 3 squared times 5 squared. So, 450 = 2 × 3² × 5². Therefore, any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 5², and 3². Let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. Divisible by 2: The number must end with an even digit. Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. So the number has to end with a 0.\n\n2. Divisible by 5² (which is 25): To be divisible by 25, the last two digits must form a number that's divisible by 25. The possible endings with 0s and 1s would be 00, 25, 50, 75. But since we can only use 0s and 1s, the only possible valid ending is 00. So the number must end with two 0s.\n\nWait, but 25 is required for divisibility by 25. So the last two digits need to be 00, 25, 50, or 75. However, since we can only use 0s and 1s, the only possible is 00. Therefore, the number must end with two 0s. So that's two of the digits fixed as 0s at the end.\n\n3. Divisible by 3² (which is 9): For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the digits are only 0s and 1s, the sum is just the number of 1s. Therefore, the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the number must:\n\n- End with two 0s (to satisfy divisibility by 25).\n- Have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9 (to satisfy divisibility by 9).\n- Start with a 1 (since it can't start with a 0).\n\nTherefore, the smallest such number would be the smallest number that starts with 1, ends with two 0s, and has a number of 1s equal to 9, 18, 27, etc. Since we want the smallest number, we need the smallest number of 1s, which is 9. So we need a number with nine 1s and two trailing 0s. However, we also need to arrange the 1s and 0s such that the entire number is as small as possible. \n\nBut wait, when arranging digits to make the smallest number, we place the smaller digits on the left. Since the number can't start with a 0, the first digit is 1. Then, we need to place the remaining 8 ones and the two zeros in such a way that the number is minimized. However, the two zeros have to be at the end. So the structure would be: 1 followed by some combination of 1s and 0s (with exactly 8 more 1s and any number of 0s) and ending with two 0s. Wait, but the total number of 1s should be 9, so if the last two digits are fixed as 0s, then the remaining digits (before the last two) must contain 9 - 2 = 7 ones? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. So if we have two trailing zeros, the number of 1s can be 9, 18, etc. So if we take the minimal case, 9 ones. So the total number of digits would be 9 (ones) + 2 (zeros) = 11 digits. But we need to arrange the 9 ones and two zeros such that the number is as small as possible. However, the two zeros have to be at the end. So the number would be something like 1 followed by eight 1s and some 0s, and then two 0s. Wait, but if we have nine 1s and two 0s, the total digits are 11. To make the smallest number, we want the most significant digits to be as small as possible. Since the first digit is 1, then we want the next digits to be 0s where possible. But the problem is that between the first 1 and the trailing zeros, we have to place the remaining 8 ones. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of 1s is nine. The last two digits are zeros, so the first nine digits must contain nine 1s. Wait, no. Wait, if the total number of 1s is nine, and the last two digits are zeros, then the first (n-2) digits must contain nine 1s. Wait, but n is the total number of digits. Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify.\n\nTotal digits in the number: Let's denote the number as N. N must end with two 0s, so the last two digits are 0. The remaining digits (before the last two 0s) must contain nine 1s. Because the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9, which is 9 here. So the number N has (9 + 2) = 11 digits: nine 1s and two 0s. But to arrange them into the smallest possible number, we need the 1s to be as far to the right as possible, except for the first digit, which must be 1. So the structure would be 1 followed by as many 0s as possible, then the remaining eight 1s. Wait, but that would be 10000000000, which is eleven digits with one 1 followed by ten 0s. But that only has one 1. But we need nine 1s. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The number must have nine 1s and two 0s. The two 0s are at the end. The first digit is 1, then we need to place the remaining eight 1s and any 0s in the preceding positions. To make the number as small as possible, after the first 1, we should place as many 0s as possible before the remaining 1s. But since we need eight more 1s, we need to have a sequence of digits starting with 1, followed by some 0s and 1s, such that there are eight 1s in total (including the first one), and the total number of digits before the last two 0s is 9. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of digits is 9 (ones) + 2 (zeros) = 11 digits. The first digit is 1, then we have 8 more 1s and two 0s. Wait, no. Wait, the total digits: If there are nine 1s and two 0s, total digits are 11. The two 0s are at the end, so the first nine digits must contain nine 1s. But that would mean all the first nine digits are 1s, followed by two 0s. So the number would be 11111111100. But that's 11 digits. But wait, that number is eleven 1s followed by two 0s? Wait, no. Wait, nine 1s and two 0s. So 11111111100. But that's 11 digits. But does that number have nine 1s? Let's count: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's nine 1s and two 0s. So yes. But is that the smallest possible?\n\nWait, 11111111100 is a pretty large number. Maybe we can arrange the 1s and 0s in a way that there are more 0s in the higher place values. For example, instead of having all the 1s first, maybe intersperse some 0s to make the number smaller. But since the number can't start with a 0, the first digit has to be 1. Then, to make the number as small as possible, we want the next digits to be 0s as much as possible. So perhaps the number is 10000000000 (ten 0s after the first 1), but that only has one 1. Not enough. So we need eight more 1s. Wait, but if the number is 1 followed by eight 1s and two 0s, but arranged such that the 0s are as far to the right as possible. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number is 100000000000000000000, but that has too many digits. Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let's think step by step.\n\nGiven that the number must end with two 0s, the number looks like N = ...00. So the last two digits are 0. The rest of the digits must form a number that is divisible by 450 / 100 = 4.5. Wait, but 450 / 100 is 4.5, which is not an integer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, since we know the number must be divisible by 2, 25, and 9. So, let's think of numbers composed of 0s and 1s that end with 00 (divisible by 25 and 2), and the sum of digits is a multiple of 9. So, the number must have a sum of digits equal to 9, 18, 27, etc. The minimal sum is 9, so we need nine 1s. Therefore, the minimal number is the smallest number with nine 1s and two 0s at the end. But how to arrange the digits to make the smallest number.\n\nThe smallest number would have the 1s as far to the right as possible. So, the first digit is 1, then as many 0s as possible, then the remaining 1s. Wait, but we need nine 1s. So, starting with 1, then we need eight more 1s. So, the number would be 1 followed by eight 1s and then two 0s. But that would be 11111111100. However, is there a way to place some 0s between the 1s to make the number smaller?\n\nFor example, 10111111100. But this has two 1s at the beginning, but the total number of 1s is still nine. However, the value of the number depends on the positions of the digits. Let's compare 11111111100 and 10111111100. Which one is smaller? The first number is 11111111100, which is 11,111,111,100. The second is 10,111,111,100. The second is smaller because after the first digit, the second digit is 0 instead of 1. So, yes, inserting a 0 as early as possible makes the number smaller.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal number is 100000000100? Wait, no. Wait, if we have nine 1s and two 0s, but inserting 0s between the 1s would decrease the value. For example, 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100. But how many 0s do we need to insert? Let's see.\n\nThe total length of the number is 9 (ones) + 2 (zeros) = 11 digits. If we want the number to be as small as possible, we need the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. Since the first digit is 1, the next digits should be 0s as much as possible. However, we need to have nine 1s in total. So, after the first digit (1), we can have some 0s, then the remaining 1s. Let's denote the number as 1 followed by k zeros and then (8 - k) ones, and then two zeros at the end. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of 1s is nine. The first digit is 1, so we need eight more 1s. So, after the first 1, we can have some 0s and then the remaining 1s. For example, 1 followed by m zeros and then (8 - m) ones, and then two zeros. The total digits would be 1 + m + (8 - m) + 2 = 12 digits. Wait, this seems off. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the entire number has to be 9 ones and 2 zeros. The two zeros are at the end. The first digit is 1. The remaining digits (positions 2 to 9) can be a combination of 1s and 0s, but we need a total of 8 more 1s. So, the number is 1 followed by some combination of 0s and 1s (with 8 ones) and then two 0s. To make the number as small as possible, after the first 1, we want as many 0s as possible before the remaining 1s. So, the optimal arrangement would be 1 followed by eight 0s and then eight 1s? Wait, no. Wait, we need eight 1s in total after the first 1. Wait, no. Wait, total 1s are nine. The first digit is 1, so remaining 1s needed are eight. So, after the first digit, we need to have eight 1s and some 0s. But how to arrange them?\n\nWait, let's think of the number as 1 [some", "answer": "11,\\! 111,\\! 111,\\! 100"}

So, we have a wheel that's spun twice, and each spin randomly determines a number. The first number is divided by 4, and the remainder tells us the column on a chessboard. The second number is divided by 5, and the remainder tells us the row. Then, a pawn is placed on the intersection of that column and row. We need to find the probability that the pawn lands on a shaded square of the chessboard.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the chessboard. A standard chessboard has 8 columns and 8 rows, alternating between black and white squares. But here, the columns are determined by dividing by 4, so there are 4 columns. Wait, that seems different from a regular chessboard. Hmm, maybe the problem is using a smaller chessboard? Let me check the Asymptote code provided.\n\nWait, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing a circle divided into parts and some lines to form a grid. The labels \"1\" through \"9\" and \"3\" on the axes. Hmm, maybe the chessboard here is 3x3? Because there are 3 columns labeled 1, 2, 3 and 3 rows labeled 1, 2, 3? But the problem mentions dividing by 4 and 5, which would give remainders 0-3 and 0-4, but the labels on the chessboard are 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, maybe the labels are shifted by 1? Let me think.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code labels the columns as 1, 2, 3 and rows as 1, 2, 3, 4? But the chessboard grid is 3 columns and 4 rows? That doesn't align with a standard chessboard. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just an illustration, not a standard chessboard. Let me focus on the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says when the wheel is spun twice, each number is determined randomly. Each number on the wheel has the same probability. The first number is divided by 4, giving remainders 1, 2, 3 (columns). The second number is divided by 5, giving remainders 1, 2, 3, 4 (rows). Then, a pawn is placed on the intersection. So the chessboard here has 3 columns (since remainders are 1, 2, 3) and 4 rows (remainders 1, 2, 3, 4). So it's a 3x4 grid. The shaded squares would be how many? Let me see the Asymptote code again. The shaded squares are in the corners: (3,0)--(3,2)--(4,2)--(4,0) for the columns, and similar for rows. Wait, maybe the shaded squares are the ones in the corners? But in the Asymptote code, they have filled certain squares. Let me parse that.\n\nThe Asymptote code draws a circle and then some lines to make a grid. The fill commands are:\n\n1. Fill((3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n2. Fill((3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n3. Fill((4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n4. Fill((4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n5. Fill((5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n6. Fill((5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle, gray(0.7));\nAnd labels for the columns and rows.\n\nWait, the coordinates in the Asymptote code might not correspond directly to the problem's chessboard. Let me try to parse the coordinates. The circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 2. Then lines are drawn from (1.7,1) to (-1.7,-1), etc., creating diagonals. Then a vertical line from (0,2) to (0,-2). The labels are placed at (0.8,0.5) as \"1\", (0.8,-0.5) as \"2\", (-0.8,0.5) as \"6\", (-0.8,-0.5) as \"9\", (-0.7,0) as \"3\", (0.7,0) as \"7\". The pointer is at (-2.8,0). So this seems like a custom-drawn wheel with numbers labeled 1, 2, 6, 9, 3, 7 around the circumference. Wait, but 6 and 9 are numbers, but maybe they are meant to be labels. The exact arrangement might be important.\n\nBut the key point is that each spin results in a number, which is then divided by 4 or 5 to get the remainder. The columns (from first spin) are remainders 1,2,3, and rows (from second spin) are remainders 1,2,3,4. So the grid is 3 columns by 4 rows. The shaded squares are probably the ones in the corners, but let's check.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the shaded areas are:\n\n1. (3,0) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,0) – this is the lower left square of the leftmost column.\n2. (3,-2) to (3,-1) to (4,-1) to (4,-2) – the lower left square of the bottom row.\n3. (4,1) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,1) – the upper right square of the rightmost column.\n4. (4,-1) to (4,0) to (5,0) to (5,-1) – the upper left square of the middle row.\n5. (5,0) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,0) – the upper right square of the rightmost column again?\n6. (5,-2) to (5,-1) to (6,-1) to (6,-2) – the lower left square of the bottom row again.\n\nWait, maybe the shaded squares are the four corners? But in the code, there are two shaded rectangles on the leftmost column (lower left and upper left) and two on the bottom row (lower left and lower right). Hmm, maybe the shaded squares are the four corners: upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right? But according to the Asymptote code, the upper right is (4,1) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,1), which is the square at column 4, row 2? Wait, the coordinates in the Asymptote code might not directly correspond to the grid. Let me think.\n\nWait, the circle is of radius 2, centered at (0,0). The lines drawn divide the circle into sections. The labels are placed at certain positions. The Asymptote code also draws a grid from (3,-2) to (6,2), creating a 3x4 grid? Maybe the chessboard is a 3x4 grid with columns 1, 2, 3 and rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then the shaded squares are the four corners of this grid. But in the Asymptote code, the shaded areas are at (3,0)-(4,1), (3,-2)-(4,-1), (4,1)-(5,2), (4,-1)-(5,0), (5,0)-(6,1), (5,-2)-(6,-1). Wait, maybe not. It's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded squares are the ones where the column and row numbers are both odd or both even? But the problem mentions \"cases ombrées\", which I think means shaded squares. Since the Asymptote code has filled some squares gray, let's try to count them.\n\nFrom the Asymptote code:\n\n1. First shaded square: from (3,0) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,0). So this is the square at column 3, row 1 (assuming x=3 is column 3, y=0 is row 1? But the coordinates are a bit unclear). Wait, in the Asymptote code, the x-axis goes from -2.8 to 6, but the labels are placed at (3,0) which might be column 3, row 0? Hmm, maybe the grid is from (3,0) to (6,-2), so columns are 3,4,5,6 and rows are 0,-1,-2? That seems conflicting. Maybe the coordinates are scaled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chessboard is divided into a grid where each column is labeled 1,2,3 and each row is labeled 1,2,3,4. The shaded squares are the four corners: (1,1), (1,4), (3,1), (3,4). But in the Asymptote code, the shaded areas are in the lower left, upper left, upper right, and lower right? Wait, the code has:\n\n1. Lower left: (3,0) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,0)\n2. Lower left bottom: (3,-2) to (3,-1) to (4,-1) to (4,-2)\n3. Upper right: (4,1) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,1)\n4. Upper left: (4,-1) to (4,0) to (5,0) to (5,-1)\n5. Upper right again: (5,0) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,0)\n6. Lower left again: (5,-2) to (5,-1) to (6,-1) to (6,-2)\n\nSo maybe the shaded squares are two on the left (lower and upper left), two on the right (upper and lower right). But in a 3x4 grid, there are 12 squares. If four of them are shaded, which ones are they? The code shades squares that are at the edges: leftmost column (columns 3 and 5?), and bottom row (rows 0 and -2). So maybe the shaded squares are the four corners: (3,0), (3,-2), (5,0), (5,-2). But in the code, the shaded areas are:\n\n1. (3,0) to (4,1) – starts at column 3, row 0, goes to column 3, row 1, and over to column 4, row 1. So this is a square from column 3 to 4, row 0 to 1. So that's the square at column 3, row 1 (since rows are from 0 to -2, but maybe the labels are shifted). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinates in the Asymptote code are not to scale. The circle has radius 2, but the grid is drawn from (3,-2) to (6,2). So the grid is centered at (4.5, 0), maybe? The labels for columns are at (3,0), (4,1), (5,0), (6,1), etc. Wait, the Asymptote code labels \"1\" at (3.5,-2), \"2\" at (4.5,-2), \"3\" at (5.5,-2), and \"1\" at (3,-1.5), \"2\" at (3,-0.5), \"3\" at (3,0.5), \"4\" at (3,1.5). So columns are labeled 1,2,3 at positions x=3,4,5, and rows are labeled 1,2,3,4 at y=-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5. So the grid is divided into 3 columns (x=3,4,5) and 4 rows (y=-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5). Each cell is 1 unit wide and 1 unit tall.\n\nTherefore, the chessboard grid is 3 columns (x=3,4,5) and 4 rows (y=-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5). The shaded squares in the Asymptote code are:\n\n1. (3,0) to (3,1): Wait, in the code, the first fill is (3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle. But according to the row labels at y=-0.5 (which is the middle of the rows?), but the y-coordinates in the code are (3,0) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,0). Wait, maybe the rows are divided as follows:\n\nEach row is between y=-1.5 to -0.5, y=-0.5 to 0.5, y=0.5 to 1.5, and y=1.5 to 2.5? But the labels are at y=-1.5, y=-0.5, y=0.5, y=1.5. So each row is 1 unit tall. Similarly, columns are x=3,4,5, each 1 unit wide.\n\nTherefore, the square from (3,0) to (4,1) is column x=3 to 4, row y=0 to 1. But according to the row labels, y=0 is actually the row below the middle. Wait, maybe the rows are shifted. If the rows are labeled at y=-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, then the row between y=-1.5 and -0.5 is row 1, between -0.5 and 0.5 is row 2, between 0.5 and 1.5 is row 3. So the square from (3,0) would be column 3, row 2 (since y=0 is between -0.5 and 0.5, which is row 2). Wait, but the square (3,0) to (4,1) spans from row 1 to row 2? Because y=0 is the boundary between row 1 and row 2. Similarly, the square (3,-2) to (4,-1) is column 3", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}
{"original_question": "Quelle est la somme des chiffres dans la représentation décimale finie de la fraction $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$ ?", "question": "Quelle est la somme des chiffres dans la représentation décimale finie de la fraction $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$ ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction 4321 divided by (5^7 times 2^8). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the fraction given is 4321 over (5^7 multiplied by 2^8). The question asks for the sum of the digits in its decimal form, which is finite. Since it's finite, that means when reduced to simplest terms, the denominator should only have factors of 2 and/or 5. Let me verify that.\n\nThe denominator here is 5^7 * 2^8. Since 5 and 2 are primes, and the denominator is already a product of these primes, the fraction should indeed terminate. So, the decimal representation will terminate, and thus, we can convert it into a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator to make the denominator a power of 10. But maybe there's a smarter way than just brute-forcing the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the fraction first. Let's see:\n\nFirst, note that 5^7 is 78125 and 2^8 is 256. So the denominator is 78125 * 256. But multiplying those together might give me a power of 10? Wait, 5^7 * 2^8 is 5^7 * 2^7 * 2 = (5*2)^7 * 2 = 10^7 * 2 = 2 * 10^7 = 20,000,000. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, 5^7 * 2^8 = 5^7 * 2^7 * 2 = (5*2)^7 * 2 = 10^7 * 2 = 2*10^7 = 20,000,000. Yes, that's right. So the denominator is 20,000,000. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 / 20,000,000. To convert this into a decimal, we can divide 4321 by 20,000,000. Alternatively, we can manipulate the fraction to have a denominator that's a power of 10.\n\nSince the denominator is 20,000,000, which is 2 * 10^7, we can write the fraction as (4321 / 20,000,000) = (4321 / (2 * 10^7)) = (4321 / 2) / 10^7 = 2160.5 / 10^7. But 2160.5 / 10^7 is equal to 0.00021605. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let's do the division step by step. 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let's write this as 4321 / 2 / 10^7. So first divide 4321 by 2: 4321 / 2 = 2160.5. Then, 2160.5 divided by 10^7 is moving the decimal point 7 places to the left. So 2160.5 becomes 0.21605, and then moving the decimal another 7 places? Wait, no. Wait, 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 2160.5 / 10,000,000 = 0.00021605. Let me confirm:\n\n2160.5 ÷ 10,000,000. Since 1,000,000 is 10^6, so 2160.5 / 10^6 = 0.0021605. Then, dividing by 10 again (to get 10^7) would move the decimal one more place to the left: 0.00021605. So that's 0.00021605. Let me count the decimal places: 0.00021605 is 0.00021605, which is 21605 divided by 100,000,000? Wait, no. Wait, 2160.5 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.00021605.\n\nBut maybe I should do the division directly. Let's try converting 4321 / 20,000,000 into a decimal. Let's note that 4321 divided by 20,000,000 is the same as 4321 divided by 20 million. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let's write this as 4321 / 20,000,000. Let's convert this into a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by something to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20,000,000 is 2 * 10^7. So, 4321 / (2 * 10^7) = (4321 / 2) / 10^7 = 2160.5 / 10^7 = 0.00021605. Wait, but 2160.5 divided by 10^7 would be 0.00021605. Let me check this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 4321 / 20,000,000. Let's move the decimal in the denominator to make it 1, which would require moving the decimal 7 places to the left, so we have to do the same to the numerator: 4321 becomes 0.4321. So, 0.4321 divided by 20,000. Wait, no, because moving the decimal 7 places in the denominator (20,000,000) to the left makes it 1, so we have to divide the numerator by 10^7 as well. Wait, that might complicate things. Maybe I should instead multiply numerator and denominator by 5^8 to make the denominator 10^7 * 5. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to note that since the denominator is 2 * 10^7, so to write the decimal, we can represent the numerator as 4321 and then place the decimal point such that there are 7 decimal places, but since the denominator is 2 * 10^7, maybe we need to adjust for the 2.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's write the fraction as 4321/(2*10^7) = (4321/2)/10^7 = 2160.5/10^7. Now, 2160.5 divided by 10^7 is 0.00021605. Let's verify that. 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 2160.5 / 10,000,000. Let's divide 2160.5 by 10,000,000. Moving the decimal point 7 places to the left: 2160.5 becomes 0.00021605. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the decimal representation is 0.00021605. Let's check if that's right. Let's compute 0.00021605 * 20,000,000. Multiplying 0.00021605 by 20,000,000: 0.0002 * 20,000,000 = 4,000. 0.00001605 * 20,000,000 = 321. So total is 4,000 + 321 = 4,321. Which matches the numerator. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the decimal representation is 0.00021605. Now, we need to sum the digits in this decimal. Let's write it out: 0.00021605. The digits after the decimal are: 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. But wait, how many digits are there? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the first decimal place:\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 0\n\n3: 0\n\n4: 2\n\n5: 1\n\n6: 6\n\n7: 0\n\n8: 5\n\nWait, but the decimal is 0.00021605. So after the decimal, there are 8 digits? Let me check:\n\n0.00021605\n\nPositions:\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 0\n\n3: 0\n\n4: 2\n\n5: 1\n\n6: 6\n\n7: 0\n\n8: 5\n\nYes, so digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Therefore, summing them up: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5 = 14. Wait, that's 14. But let me confirm again because decimals can sometimes be confusing in terms of digit positions.\n\nWait, but the question says \"la somme des chiffres dans la representation decimale finie\". So the decimal representation is 0.00021605, which as digits after the decimal is 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So adding those: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5 = 14. But let me check if the decimal is indeed 0.00021605.\n\nWait, but when I converted 4321 divided by 20,000,000, I got 0.00021605. Let me verify that with another method. Let's do long division of 4321 by 20,000,000.\n\nSo 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Since 20,000,000 is larger than 4321, the decimal will start with some zeros after the decimal point. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. Let's write this as 4321.0 divided by 20,000,000. Since 20,000,000 is 2*10^7, so we can write this as 4321.0 / 20,000,000.\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\n20,000,000 goes into 43,210 (after adding a decimal point and some zeros) how many times?\n\nWait, actually, let's set it up properly:\n\nDividend: 4321.00000000\n\nDivisor: 20,000,000\n\nWe need to divide 4321.00000000 by 20,000,000.\n\nSince the divisor is 20 million, which is greater than 4321, the result will be less than 1. So we start by adding decimal places.\n\nFirst, how many times does 20,000,000 go into 43,210,000 (which is 4321.0 moved one decimal place)? Wait, maybe I should use the long division method step by step.\n\nAlternatively, note that 4321 / 20,000,000 = (4321/20,000,000) = (4321/2)/10,000,000 = 2160.5 / 10,000,000 = 0.00021605.\n\nYes, so that seems correct. Therefore, the decimal is 0.00021605, which is 0.00021605. So written out, it's 0.00021605. So the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So adding those: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when decimals are written, leading zeros after the decimal might not be counted, but in this case, all the digits after the decimal are necessary to represent the value. So each digit, including leading zeros, should be included in the sum. So 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5 is indeed 14. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the decimal placement.\n\nWait, let's confirm the decimal value again. Let's compute 0.00021605 * 20,000,000. 0.0002 * 20,000,000 = 4,000. 0.00001605 * 20,000,000 = 321.0. So 4,000 + 321 = 4,321, which matches the numerator. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the decimal is indeed 0.00021605, and the digits are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Sum is 14. But wait, maybe there's a", "answer": "14"}

The problem is to find the product of several sine values: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, and sin 160°. Hmm, that's quite a few terms. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that products of sines can sometimes be simplified using trigonometric identities. Maybe there's a pattern here or some symmetry I can exploit. Let me list out all the angles:\n\n20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°.\n\nLooking at these, I notice that some angles are supplementary or have some relation. For example, 20° and 160° add up to 180°, so sin 160° = sin(180° - 20°) = sin 20°. Similarly, 40° and 140° add up to 180°, so sin 140° = sin 40°. Similarly, 60° and 120° add up to 180°, so sin 120° = sin 60°. Then, 80° and 100° add up to 180°, so sin 100° = sin 80°. So actually, the product can be rewritten in pairs:\n\nsin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80° × sin100° × sin120° × sin140° × sin160° = (sin20° × sin160°) × (sin40° × sin140°) × (sin60° × sin120°) × (sin80° × sin100°)\n\nBut since sin(180° - x) = sinx, each of these pairs is equal to sinx × sinx. Wait, no. Wait, sin160° = sin20°, so sin20° × sin160° = sin20° × sin20° = sin²20°. Similarly, sin140° = sin40°, so sin40° × sin140° = sin²40°, and so on. So the entire product becomes:\n\nsin²20° × sin²40° × sin²60° × sin²80°.\n\nBut wait, that seems like we have squared terms. However, the original product is sin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80° × sin100° × sin120° × sin140° × sin160°, which simplifies to sin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80° × sin80° × sin60° × sin40° × sin20°, which is indeed (sin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80°)². Because each term is duplicated except sin60°, which is paired with itself. Wait, no:\n\nWait, original angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°.\n\nBut 100° is 180°-80°, so sin100°=sin80°; 120°=180°-60°, so sin120°=sin60°; 140°=180°-40°, so sin140°=sin40°; 160°=180°-20°, so sin160°=sin20°. Therefore, the original product is:\n\nsin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80° × sin80° × sin60° × sin40° × sin20° = (sin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80°)^2.\n\nSo the product is the square of the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°. Therefore, if I can compute the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, then squaring it would give the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the product directly, considering the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using complex numbers or product-to-sum formulas. Let me recall that there is a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression, but here the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are not in arithmetic progression. Wait, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° – the common difference is 20°, so they are in arithmetic progression with common difference 20°, starting at 20°, four terms. So maybe the formula for the product of sines in arithmetic progression can be applied here.\n\nThe formula for the product of sines in arithmetic progression: If we have angles a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d, then the product can be expressed... Hmm, I don't remember the exact formula, but perhaps I can look it up in my mind. Alternatively, recall that for the product of sines with angles in arithmetic progression, there's a formula involving powers of 2 and some trigonometric functions. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for multiple angles. For example, sinθ × sin(60° - θ) × sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. Wait, that might be useful here. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the angles 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°. If I group them as (20°, 40°, 80°) and 60°. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps pairing angles such that they can be expressed using sum and difference.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° can be written as multiples of 20°, which is 1/9 of 180°, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that sin60° = √3/2. So that term is known.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for the product of sines:\n\nProduct_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n/(2^{n-1})\n\nBut this is for angles in radians, and here we have degrees. Wait, but maybe there's an analogous formula in degrees. Let me recall that formula. For example, the product of sines of angles kπ/(2n+1) for k from 1 to n is sqrt((2n+1)/2^{2n}} or something like that. Wait, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, since the angles are in arithmetic progression, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, with common difference 20°, starting at 20°, four terms. So n=4, d=20°, a=20°. Then the product formula might be applicable here.\n\nLooking up the formula for the product of sines in arithmetic progression: After a quick recall, I think the formula is:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n-1} sin(a + kd) = something involving powers of 2 and other trigonometric terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials. Let me recall that sinθ = (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i), so the product can be written as a product of such terms. But that might get complicated with eight terms. Alternatively, note that some terms are duplicates due to sine of supplementary angles. Wait, we already used that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that the product of sines can be related to a multiple-angle formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° can be written as 20°, 2×20°, 3×20°, 4×20°, so multiples of 20° up to 4×20°. So perhaps using the formula for the product of sines of multiple angles. For example, there is a formula for sinθ × sin2θ × sin3θ...× sin nθ, but I don't recall it exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates the product of sines to a polynomial whose roots are the sines of the angles. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the product step by step. Let me first compute sin20° × sin40° × sin60° × sin80°.\n\nFirst, compute sin20° × sin80°. Maybe using the identity sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.\n\nSo sin20° × sin80° = [cos(60°) - cos(100°)] / 2.\n\nSimilarly, sin40° × sin60° = [cos(20°) - cos(100°)] / 2.\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes:\n\n([cos60° - cos100°]/2) × ([cos20° - cos100°]/2).\n\nSo that's (cos60° - cos100°)(cos20° - cos100°) / 4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, cos60° = 0.5, cos100° = cos(180° - 80°) = -cos80°, so cos100° = -cos80°.\n\nSimilarly, cos20° is just cos20°.\n\nTherefore, substitute these values:\n\n(0.5 - (-cos80°)) (cos20° - (-cos80°)) / 4 = (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) / 4.\n\nNow, let's compute this product. Let's denote x = cos80°, y = cos20°. Then the expression becomes (0.5 + x)(y + x)/4.\n\nExpanding this:\n\n[0.5y + 0.5x + xy + x²] / 4.\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps use numerical values to approximate and check, but since the answer is likely a nice fraction or multiple of sqrt(3), maybe exact value exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the identity for cosA + cosB. Wait, but we have cos20° + cos80°. Let me compute that:\n\ncos20° + cos80° = 2 cos50° cos30°, using the identity cosA + cosB = 2 cos((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2). So here, A=80°, B=20°, so (A+B)/2=50°, (A-B)/2=30°, so it becomes 2 cos50° cos30°. So cos20° + cos80° = 2 cos50° cos30°.\n\nSimilarly, 0.5 + cos80° = 0.5 + cos80°, which is not as straightforward, but maybe we can write 0.5 as cos60°, so 0.5 + cos80° = cos60° + cos80°, which can be written as 2 cos70° cos10°, again using the identity cosA + cosB = 2 cos((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2). Here, A=80°, B=60°, so (A+B)/2=70°, (A-B)/2=10°, so cos60° + cos80° = 2 cos70° cos10°.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[2 cos70° cos10° × 2 cos50° cos30°] / 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression was (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°)/4. So substituting the expressions:\n\n[2 cos70° cos10°] × [2 cos50° cos30°] / 4.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 4 cos70° cos10° cos50° cos30°, divided by 4, so cos70° cos10° cos50° cos30°.\n\nSo now we have cos70° cos10° cos50° cos30°. Let's see. Let me compute this product.\n\nFirst, note that cos70° = sin20°, cos10° remains, cos50° = sin40°, and cos30° = √3/2. So perhaps writing in terms of sines?\n\nAlternatively, note that 70°, 50°, and 10°, 30°: maybe some pairing.\n\nAlternatively, use product-to-sum identities again. Let me try.\n\nFirst, pair cos70° and cos10°, and cos50° and cos30°.\n\nCompute cos70° cos10° = [cos(70° + 10°) + cos(70° - 10°)] / 2 = [cos80° + cos60°]/2.\n\nSimilarly, cos50° cos30° = [cos(50° + 30°) + cos(50° - 30°)] / 2 = [cos80° + cos20°]/2.\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\n([cos80° + cos60°]/2) × ([cos80° + cos20°]/2) / (cos30°)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression after substitution was cos70° cos10° cos50° cos30°, which we broke down into ([cos80° + cos60°]/2) × ([cos80° + cos20°]/2) / (cos30°)?\n\nWait", "answer": "\\frac{9}{256}"}

Let me recall what cylindrical coordinates are. In cylindrical coordinates, a point in 3D space is represented by (r, θ, z), where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, θ is the angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane, and z is the height, just like in Cartesian coordinates. \n\nThe equation given is z = c. Hmm, so that would mean that for all points on this shape, their z-coordinate is fixed at c. In Cartesian coordinates, if z is constant, that's a horizontal plane. But since we're in cylindrical coordinates, does that translate similarly?\n\nWait, in cylindrical coordinates, even though we use r and θ to describe the radial position, the z-coordinate still directly corresponds to the height. So if z is fixed at c, then regardless of r and θ, as long as z is c, the set of all such points would form a horizontal plane cutting through the z-axis at height c. \n\nBut let me make sure. Let me think again. In cylindrical coordinates, the coordinates are (r, θ, z). So r and θ define a point in the xy-plane, and z is the vertical coordinate. If z is fixed, then regardless of how far out you go in the xy-plane (controlled by r and θ), you stay at the same height z = c. So that should indeed be a horizontal plane.\n\nLooking at the options: (A) Lique, which I think is a typo and probably not. (B) Cercle, which is circle, but in 3D, a circle would be a 2D shape, but z = c in 3D is a plane, so probably not. (C) Plan, which is plane, yes. (D) Sphère, sphere, which is a 3D surface where all points are equidistant from a center. So z = c isn't a sphere. (E) Cylindinger, which is a surface with radius r around the z-axis, but that would be r = constant. (F) Con, cone, which is a surface that tapers to a point. That would be something like z = m r + b or something. So none of these seem to fit except (C) Plan.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If r is allowed to vary from 0 to infinity, and θ varies from 0 to 2π, but z is fixed, then yes, that's a plane. If r were fixed and θ varied, then it might be a circle, but since both r and θ can vary, it's a plane. So the answer should be (C) Plan.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates represents all points where the height \\( z \\) is constant.

The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is the vector (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let's see. I remember that the cross product of two vectors is related to the sine of the angle between them. Specifically, the magnitude of the cross product is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. So, maybe I can use that formula here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula: ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, where θ is the angle between vectors a and b. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, then I can solve for sinθ. Once I have sinθ, I can find θ by taking the inverse sine. That should give me the angle. But the question says \"the smallest possible angle,\" so I need to make sure that this is indeed the angle we're supposed to find. Wait, but is there a possibility of another angle? Hmm, no, because the cross product magnitude is directly related to sinθ, which is a function that has a unique value between 0 and π. So, if we compute arcsin of that value, we should get the angle between 0 and 180 degrees. But since they're asking for the smallest possible angle, maybe θ is acute? But perhaps there's a catch here. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the cross product magnitude is ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, and the direction of the cross product is given by the right-hand rule. But since we're just given the vector, the magnitude is ||a × b||. So, let's compute that first. The cross product vector given is (3, 2, 6). To find its magnitude, I need to calculate the square root of (3² + 2² + 6²). Let's compute that:\n\n3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 + 36 = 49. The square root of 49 is 7. So, ||a × b|| = 7.\n\nNow, according to the formula, ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. We have ||a|| = 2, ||b|| = 7, so substituting in:\n\n7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ\n\nSimplify the right side: 2*7 is 14, so 7 = 14 sinθ. Then, divide both sides by 14:\n\nsinθ = 7 / 14 = 1/2\n\nSo, sinθ = 1/2. Therefore, θ is the angle whose sine is 1/2. The principal value for arcsin(1/2) is 30 degrees. But wait, sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants, so θ could be 30 degrees or 150 degrees. However, since the cross product is a vector, the direction tells us about the orientation, but the angle between two vectors is always between 0 and 180 degrees, right? So, the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle between them when they are placed tail to tail. Therefore, the angle should be 30 degrees, which is acute. So, 30 degrees is the smallest possible angle. Therefore, the answer is 30 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check. The formula gives us ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, so sinθ is positive, which means θ is between 0 and 180 degrees. Since sinθ = 1/2, θ can be 30 or 150 degrees. But the angle between two vectors is defined as the smallest angle between them, so it's the acute angle. Therefore, 30 degrees is correct. But let me check if there's any catch here. The cross product's magnitude is 7, and the product of the magnitudes is 14. So, 7 is half of 14, so sinθ is 1/2, which gives 30 degrees. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the dot product to find the angle. Wait, the dot product formula is ||a|| ||b|| cosθ = a · b. But we don't have the dot product here. However, maybe we can compute the area of the parallelogram formed by a and b, which is ||a × b|| = 7, which is the same as the area. The area is also ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, which we already used. So, maybe not necessary. But just to confirm, if I compute the cross product's magnitude, which we did, and relate it to the sine of the angle, that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to find the angle using the dot product, we would need to know the dot product. But since we don't have that information, we can't directly use the dot product formula. So, the cross product magnitude is the way to go here.\n\nTherefore, the angle θ satisfies sinθ = 1/2, so θ = 30 degrees. Therefore, the smallest possible angle is 30 degrees. Wait, but the problem says \"le plus petit angle possible entre a et b\", which translates to \"the smallest possible angle between a and b\". But in reality, given the cross product, the angle is uniquely determined? Wait, no. Because the cross product's magnitude is ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, but if you have two vectors, their cross product's magnitude depends on the sine of the angle between them. So, given that the cross product's magnitude is fixed here, there are two possible angles: θ and 180 - θ. But the angle between two vectors is defined as the smallest one, so between 0 and 180 degrees. So, if sinθ = 1/2, then θ is 30 degrees, and 150 degrees. But 30 degrees is smaller, so the angle between them is 30 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 30 degrees.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me check once again:\n\nGiven ||a|| = 2, ||b|| = 7, a × b = (3,2,6). Compute ||a × b||: sqrt(9 + 4 + 36) = sqrt(49) = 7. Then, ||a × b|| = 7, and ||a|| ||b|| sinθ = 2*7*sinθ = 14 sinθ. Therefore, 7 = 14 sinθ => sinθ = 0.5 => θ = 30° or 150°, but since we take the smallest angle, 30° is the answer. Yep, that seems right. So, the answer is 30 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest possible angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) degrees.\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 2\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = 7\\), and their cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, \\(\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin\\theta\\), we substitute the known values:\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\times 7 \\times \\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sin\\theta\\):\n\\[\n7 = 14 \\sin\\theta \\implies \\sin\\theta = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) whose sine is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) or \\(150^\\circ\\).

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a cubic polynomial, the sum of the roots is related to the coefficient of the x² term. Specifically, if the polynomial is ax³ + bx² + cx + d, then the sum of the roots is -b/a. So maybe I can use that here.\n\nBut wait, g(x) is f(x + 5). So I need to find the sum of the roots of g(x). Let me recall that if a function h(x) has roots r1, r2, r3, then the function h(x + k) will have roots shifted by -k. That is, the roots of h(x + k) are r1 - k, r2 - k, r3 - k.

So if the original roots of f(x) are s1, s2, s3, then the roots of g(x) will be s1 - 5, s2 - 5, s3 - 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (s1 - 5) + (s2 - 5) + (s3 - 5) = (s1 + s2 + s3) - 15. So if I can find the sum of the roots of f(x), subtract 15, and that should give me the sum of the roots of g(x).\n\nNow, for f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, the coefficients are a = 1 (for x³), b = -49 (for x²), c = 623 (for x), d = -2015. So the sum of the roots of f(x) is -b/a = -(-49)/1 = 49. So the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49. Then, subtracting 15 gives 49 - 15 = 34. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) should be 34.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, I can consider expanding g(x) = f(x + 5) and then compute the coefficients of the resulting polynomial, and then use Vieta's formula again. Let's try that to verify.\n\nFirst, let's write out f(x + 5):\n\nf(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.\n\nLet me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (x + 5)³. That expands to x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.\n\nSecond term: -49(x + 5)². Let's compute (x + 5)² first, which is x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225.\n\nThird term: 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115.\n\nFourth term: -2015.\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\nFirst term: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125\n\nSecond term: -49x² - 490x - 1225\n\nThird term: 623x + 3115\n\nFourth term: -2015\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nStart with the x³ term: only x³. So x³.\n\nNext, x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = (15 - 49)x² = -34x².\n\nx terms: 75x - 490x + 623x = (75 - 490 + 623)x. Let me compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 = 208. So 208x.\n\nConstant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step.\n\n125 - 1225 = -1100\n\n-1100 + 3115 = 2015\n\n2015 - 2015 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0. So g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients are a = 1, b = -34, c = 208, d = 0.\n\nThen, the sum of the roots of g(x) is -b/a = -(-34)/1 = 34. So that matches the previous result. So the sum of the roots is indeed 34.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same answer, so I can be confident that the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.\n\nBut let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The key idea here is that shifting the input of a polynomial by a constant (in this case, 5) shifts all the roots by that constant. Therefore, the sum of the roots is shifted by 5 for each root, hence subtracting 5 times the number of roots (which is 3 here) from the original sum. Since the original sum was 49, subtracting 15 gives 34. Alternatively, expanding the polynomial and looking at the coefficient gives the same result. So both approaches confirm that the sum is 34.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. So the answer should be 34.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{34}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the roots of the function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\) where \\( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \\):\n\n1. **Sum of roots of \\( f(x) \\)**:\n   - The polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 1 and the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is -49.\n   - The sum of the roots of \\( f(x) \\) is given by \\( -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Effect of shifting the polynomial**:\n   - The roots of \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\) are each shifted by -5 compared to the roots of \\( f(x) \\).\n   - If the roots of \\( f(x) \\) are \\( s_1, s_2, s_3 \\), the roots of \\( g(x) \\) are \\( s_1 - 5, s_2 - 5, s_3 - 5 \\).\n   - The sum of the roots of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( (s_1 - 5) + (s_2 - 5) + (s_3 - 5) = (s_1 + s_2 + s_3) - 15 \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the sum**:\n   - The sum of the roots of \\( f(x) \\) is 49.\n   - Subtracting 15 from this sum gives \\( 49 - 15 = 34 \\).\n\n4. **Verification by expanding \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   - Expanding \\( f(x + 5) \\) and combining like terms results in the polynomial \\( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \\).\n   - The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is -34, so the sum of the roots of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( -\\frac{-34}{1} = 34 \\).\n\nThus, the sum of the roots of \\( g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).", "answer": "34"}

Hmm. Let me write that down again to make sure I got it right. It's 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Alright, the question is asking for the sum of these three terms. I need to figure out how to compute this. Let's see.\n\nFirst, maybe I can recall some trigonometric identities that might help simplify these terms. I know that 1/cos²θ is equal to sec²θ, and there's an identity that relates sec²θ to tan²θ: sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ. Similarly, 1/sin²θ is csc²θ, and there's an identity for csc²θ as well: csc²θ = 1 + cot²θ. But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express these terms in terms of angles that are related, like complementary angles or something. Let's check the angles given: 10°, 20°, 40°. Hmm, 10°, 20°, 40°—I notice that 10° + 20° + 40° = 70°, which isn't a special angle I know of. Wait, but 40° is twice 20°, so maybe there's a double-angle identity here. Let's think about that.\n\nAlso, 10°, 20°, and 40°—each is a multiple of 10°, so maybe there's a pattern with that. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate these angles through complementary angles. For example, sin40° is equal to cos50°, since sinθ = cos(90° - θ). Let me check that: sin40° = cos(50°), yes, because 90° - 40° = 50°. Similarly, sin20° = cos70°, and sin10° = cos80°. But I don't know if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using sum formulas or product-to-sum identities. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of sine or cosine of the same angle. Let me see. Let's write all terms in terms of sine or cosine. The first term is 1/cos²10°, which is sec²10°. The next two terms are 1/sin²20° and 1/sin²40°. So, maybe if I can express sec²10° in terms of sine or cosine? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use reciprocal identities.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe use the identity 1/cos²θ = 1 + tan²θ. So, 1/cos²10° = 1 + tan²10°. Then, the expression becomes 1 + tan²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use the identity for 1/sin²θ. Let's recall that 1/sin²θ = 1 + cot²θ. So, 1/sin²20° = 1 + cot²20°, and similarly 1/sin²40° = 1 + cot²40°. So, substituting that in, the entire expression becomes:\n\n1 + tan²10° + 1 + cot²20° + 1 + cot²40° = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. Hmm. So, now we have 3 plus these other terms. Maybe this is a better approach? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find some relationship between tan²10°, cot²20°, and cot²40°. Let's see. Let me calculate tan10°, cot20°, and cot40° numerically first to see if there's a pattern or something. But wait, maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, think about angles in terms of their relationships. For example, 20° is twice 10°, and 40° is twice 20°, so maybe there are double-angle identities here.\n\nLet me recall that cotθ = tan(90° - θ). So, cot20° = tan70°, and cot40° = tan50°. So, cot²20° = tan²70°, cot²40° = tan²50°. So, substituting that in, the expression becomes 3 + tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Wait, 10°, 50°, 70°—those angles add up to 130°, which isn't particularly special. Alternatively, maybe 10°, 50°, 70° are related in another way. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here.\n\nWait, 10°, 50°, 70°, if we subtract 90°, we get negative angles, but maybe not. Alternatively, 10° is complementary to 80°, 50° is complementary to 40°, 70° is complementary to 20°. So, tan²10° = cot²80°, tan²50° = cot²40°, tan²70° = cot²20°. So, substituting back, that's the same as 3 + cot²80° + cot²40° + cot²20°. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the expression 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Let's see if there's a way to combine these terms or relate them through some identity. Alternatively, maybe use complex numbers or Euler's formula? That might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's a telescoping series or something when combining these terms. Wait, but they are all separate terms added together. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for sin2θ or cos2θ. Let's see. For example, sin20° is 2sin10°cos10°, but not sure. Wait, let's see. Let me write down the terms again:\n\n1/cos²10°, 1/sin²20°, 1/sin²40°.\n\nHmm. Let's see if we can relate these angles. 10°, 20°, 40°—each is double the previous: 10°, 20°=2*10°, 40°=2*20°. So, perhaps there's a pattern with doubling angles. Let's recall that sin2θ = 2sinθcosθ. So, maybe express 1/sin²20° as 1/(4sin²10°cos²10°). Wait, because sin20° = 2sin10°cos10°, so sin²20° = 4sin²10°cos²10°. Therefore, 1/sin²20° = 1/(4sin²10°cos²10°). Similarly, sin40° = 2sin20°cos20°, so 1/sin²40° = 1/(4sin²20°cos²20°). But 20° is double 10°, so maybe we can express this in terms of 10° as well. Let's try that.\n\nSo, let's rewrite each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/cos²10°.\n\nSecond term: 1/sin²20° = 1/(4sin²10°cos²10°).\n\nThird term: 1/sin²40° = 1/(4sin²20°cos²20°). But sin20° = 2sin10°cos10°, so sin²20° = 4sin²10°cos²10°, so substituting back, 1/sin²40° = 1/(4*(4sin²10°cos²10°)*cos²20°) = 1/(16sin²10°cos²10°cos²20°). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express all terms in terms of sin10° and cos10°. Let's see:\n\nFirst term: 1/cos²10°.\n\nSecond term: 1/sin²20° = 1/(4sin²10°cos²10°).\n\nThird term: 1/sin²40°. Let's express sin40° as sin(2*20°) = 2sin20°cos20°, so sin²40° = 4sin²20°cos²20°. Then, since sin20° = 2sin10°cos10°, so sin²20° = 4sin²10°cos²10°, so sin²40° = 4*(4sin²10°cos²10°)*cos²20° = 16sin²10°cos²10°cos²20°. Therefore, 1/sin²40° = 1/(16sin²10°cos²10°cos²20°).\n\nSo, now the entire expression becomes:\n\n1/cos²10° + 1/(4sin²10°cos²10°) + 1/(16sin²10°cos²10°cos²20°).\n\nHmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that 1/cos²θ = 1 + tan²θ, as I mentioned earlier. So, maybe:\n\n1/cos²10° = 1 + tan²10°,\n\n1/sin²20° = 1 + cot²20°,\n\n1/sin²40° = 1 + cot²40°.\n\nTherefore, the sum becomes:\n\n(1 + tan²10°) + (1 + cot²20°) + (1 + cot²40°) = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°.\n\nSo, now we need to compute tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. Let's see.\n\nFirst, note that cotθ = tan(90° - θ), so cot20° = tan70°, and cot40° = tan50°. Therefore, cot²20° = tan²70°, cot²40° = tan²50°. So, the expression becomes tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°.\n\nHmm, so we need to compute tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°. Is there a known identity for the sum of squares of tangents at these angles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these angles are related in a way that their sum is 130°, which is 90° + 40°, but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity involving sum of squares of tangents for specific angles.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that tan3θ = (3tanθ - tan³θ)/(1 - 3tan²θ). Maybe if we can relate 10°, 50°, 70° to some multiple angles. For example, 3*10° = 30°, 3*50° = 150°, 3*70° = 210°. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use complex numbers. Let me think. If we consider complex exponentials, perhaps we can express these tangents in terms of sine and cosine. But this might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, recall that tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, so tan²θ = sin²θ/cos²θ. So, tan²10° = sin²10°/cos²10°, tan²50° = sin²50°/cos²50°, tan²70° = sin²70°/cos²70°. So, the sum is:\n\nsin²10°/cos²10° + sin²50°/cos²50° + sin²70°/cos²70°.\n\nHmm. Let's write each term as (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ = 1/cos²θ - 1. Wait, that's just tan²θ + 1 = sec²θ. Wait, no, that's the original identity. Wait, sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, so sin²θ/cos²θ = (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ = 1/cos²θ - 1. Therefore, tan²θ = sec²θ - 1. Which is the same identity. So, maybe that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each term as (sin²θ)/(cos²θ) = (1 - cos2θ)/2 / cos²θ. Wait, that might not be helpful. Let's see. Let me write each term as:\n\nFor θ = 10°, 50°, 70°:\n\ntan²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/ (1 + cos2θ). Wait, that's a formula for tan²θ in terms of cos2θ. Let me verify:\n\ntan²θ = (sin²θ)/(cos²θ) = (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/ (1 + cos2θ). Yes, that's correct. Because cos2θ = 2cos²θ - 1, so 1 - cos2θ = 2sin²θ, and 1 + cos2θ = 2cos²θ. Therefore, (1 - cos2θ)/(1 + cos2θ) = (2sin²θ)/(2cos²θ) = tan²θ. So, yes, tan²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/(1 + cos2θ). So, maybe using this identity can help.\n\nSo, applying this to each term:\n\ntan²10° = (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°),\n\ntan²50°", "answer": "12"}

The problem is asking how many sides a convex polygon would have if the sum of all its interior angles except one is 1070 degrees. Hmm. Alright, so first, I need to remember the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon. I think it's (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. Right? Yeah, that sounds familiar. For example, a triangle (3 sides) has (3-2)*180 = 180 degrees, which is correct. A quadrilateral (4 sides) has (4-2)*180 = 360 degrees, which is also right.\n\nSo the problem says that if we take the sum of all the interior angles except one, it's 1070 degrees. That means the total sum of the interior angles minus one of the angles equals 1070. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal sum - one angle = 1070\n\nSo, if the total sum is (n-2)*180, then:\n\n(n-2)*180 - x = 1070\n\nWhere x is the measure of the missing interior angle. Now, since it's a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees. So x < 180. That gives me a range for possible x. Also, since x is an angle in a polygon, it must be a positive number. So x > 0. Therefore, 0 < x < 180.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation:\n\n(n-2)*180 = 1070 + x\n\nBut since x is between 0 and 180, then 1070 < (n-2)*180 < 1070 + 180\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1070 < (n-2)*180 < 1250\n\nDivide all parts by 180:\n\n1070/180 < n - 2 < 1250/180\n\nCalculating 1070 divided by 180. Let's see, 180*5 = 900, 1070 - 900 = 170. So 1070/180 = 5 + 170/180 ≈ 5.944...\n\nSimilarly, 1250/180: 180*6 = 1080, 1250 - 1080 = 170. So 1250/180 = 6 + 170/180 ≈ 6.944...\n\nSo,\n\n5.944... < n - 2 < 6.944...\n\nTherefore, n - 2 is between approximately 5.944 and 6.944. Since n must be an integer (number of sides), n - 2 must also be an integer. The only integer between 5.944 and 6.944 is 6. So n - 2 = 6, which means n = 8.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If n - 2 is 6, then n is 8. Let's verify this.\n\nIf n = 8, the total sum of interior angles is (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080 degrees. Then, if we subtract one angle x, the sum becomes 1080 - x = 1070. Therefore, x = 1080 - 1070 = 10 degrees. Wait, x is 10 degrees? But in a convex polygon, all interior angles have to be greater than 0 and less than 180. 10 degrees is valid. So that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, is there another possible n? Let me check. If n - 2 was 7, then n would be 9. Then total sum would be 7*180 = 1260. Then 1260 - x = 1070, so x = 1260 - 1070 = 190. But 190 degrees is greater than 180, which is not allowed in a convex polygon. So that's invalid. Similarly, if n - 2 was 5, then n = 7. Total sum is 5*180 = 900. Then 900 - x = 1070, which would mean x = 900 - 1070 = -170. Negative angle, which is impossible. So n -2 can't be 5. Similarly, if n -2 was 6, as we saw, x = 10, which is okay. So n = 8 is the only possible solution.\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 8 sides. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nTotal sum of angles except one: 1070. Total sum is (n-2)*180. So (n-2)*180 - x = 1070. Since x is between 0 and 180, then (n-2)*180 must be between 1070 and 1250. Calculated that n-2 is approximately 5.944 to 6.944, so n-2 must be 6. Thus n=8. Then x=10, which is valid. So yes, 8 sides.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. The key was realizing that x has to be between 0 and 180, so we can find n by bounding (n-2)*180 between 1070 and 1250. Since n has to be an integer, only n=8 works. So the answer should be 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polygon has \\boxed{8} sides.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), we start by using the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\).

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an inverse modulo 23 means. If a number x is the inverse of y modulo 23, then x * y ≡ 1 mod 23. So, in this problem, we have that t + 2 multiplied by t should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. That gives me the equation:\n\n(t + 2) * t ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes:\n\nt² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\nSo, the equation to solve is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. Alright, so I need to find t such that this quadratic congruence holds. Since t is an integer between 0 and 23, and it's supposed to be odd, we can check the odd numbers in that range. But maybe there's a smarter way than just plugging in all the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve the quadratic equation modulo 23. Let me try completing the square or using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe standard quadratic formula is t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). But working modulo 23, we have to be careful with division and square roots. Let's see:\n\nThe equation is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 2, c = -1.\n\nSo discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 4 - 4(1)(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo D = 8. Now, we need to find the square roots of 8 modulo 23. Hmm, 8 is not a perfect square, so we need to find some number x such that x² ≡ 8 mod 23.\n\nLet me try squaring numbers from 1 to 11 modulo 23 (since squares are symmetric around 11.5):\n\n1² = 1 mod 23\n\n2² = 4\n\n3² = 9\n\n4² = 16\n\n5² = 25 ≡ 2 mod 23\n\n6² = 36 ≡ 13 mod 23\n\n7² = 49 ≡ 3 mod 23\n\n8² = 64 ≡ 18 mod 23\n\n9² = 81 ≡ 12 mod 23\n\n10² = 100 ≡ 8 mod 23\n\n11² = 121 ≡ 121 - 5*23 = 121 - 115 = 6 mod 23\n\nSo, 10² ≡ 8 mod 23. Therefore, sqrt(8) mod 23 is 10 and -10 ≡ 13 mod 23.\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\nt = [-2 ± 10] / 2 mod 23.\n\nWait, but division by 2 modulo 23. Since 2 and 23 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod 23 is 12 because 2*12 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. So, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 12.\n\nTherefore, let's compute both solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (-2 + 10) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 mod 23. But 4 is even, and we need an odd t, so maybe this is not the solution? Wait, but let's check if 4 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, t = 4: check if (4 + 2) * 4 ≡ 1 mod 23. That is, 6 * 4 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, 24 mod 23 is 1. So 4 is a solution. But 4 is even, so it's not the answer we need. Hmm.\n\nSecond solution: (-2 - 10) / 2 = (-12) / 2 = -6 mod 23. Which is equivalent to 17 mod 23 (since -6 + 23 = 17). 17 is odd, so that's our candidate. Let's check:\n\n(17 + 2) * 17 = 19 * 17. Let's compute 19*17. 20*17=340, minus 1*17=17, so 340 -17=323. Now, 323 divided by 23: 23*14=322, so 323 - 322 =1. Therefore, 323 ≡1 mod23. So yes, 19*17≡1 mod23. Therefore, t=17 is a solution.\n\nSince 17 is odd and between 0 and 23, that's the unique solution they're asking for. Let me confirm that there are no other solutions. Since we solved the quadratic equation, and in modular arithmetic, a quadratic equation can have at most two solutions, and we found two solutions: 4 and 17. But since they asked for the odd one, 17 is the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check all odd numbers between 0 and 23 to make sure there's no other solution. Let's list them:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21.\n\nLet's compute (t + 2) * t mod23 for each:\n\nt=1: (3)(1)=3 mod23≠1\n\nt=3: (5)(3)=15≠1\n\nt=5: (7)(5)=35≡35-23=12≠1\n\nt=7: (9)(7)=63≡63-2*23=63-46=17≠1\n\nt=9: (11)(9)=99≡99-4*23=99-92=7≠1\n\nt=11: (13)(11)=143≡143-6*23=143-138=5≠1\n\nt=13: (15)(13)=195≡195-8*23=195-184=11≠1\n\nt=15: (17)(15)=255≡255-11*23=255-253=2≠1\n\nt=17: (19)(17)=323≡1 as before.\n\nt=19: (21)(19)=399≡399-17*23=399-391=8≠1\n\nt=21: (23)(21)=483≡483-21*23=483-483=0≠1\n\nSo indeed, only t=17 works. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unique odd integer is \\boxed{17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the odd integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 0 < t < 23 \\) and \\( t + 2 \\) is the inverse of \\( t \\) modulo 23, we start with the equation:\n\n\\[\n(t + 2) \\cdot t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we get the quadratic congruence:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 2t - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) modulo 23, where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\), we calculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nD = 2^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = 4 + 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nWe need the square roots of 8 modulo 23.

{"original_question": "Quelle est la surface totale, en pouces carrés, d'un cube ayant un volume de $1$ pied cube ?", "question": "Quelle est la surface totale, en pouces carrés, d'un cube ayant un volume de $1$ pied cube ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the total surface area of a cube that has a volume of 1 cubic foot, and the answer should be in square inches. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic formulas. \n\nFirst, the volume of a cube is given by the formula \\( V = s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the length of a side. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, I can set up the equation \\( 1 \\, \\text{ft}^3 = s^3 \\). Solving for \\( s \\), I take the cube root of both sides, which gives \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{1 \\, \\text{ft}^3} \\). The cube root of 1 is 1, so each side of the cube is 1 foot long. \n\nNow, the problem asks for the surface area in square inches. I remember that a cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The surface area of a cube is therefore \\( 6s^2 \\). Since each side is 1 foot, the area of one face is \\( 1 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 1 \\, \\text{ft} = 1 \\, \\text{ft}^2 \\). Multiplying by 6 gives a total surface area of \\( 6 \\times 1 \\, \\text{ft}^2 = 6 \\, \\text{ft}^2 \\).\n\nBut wait, the answer needs to be in square inches. I need to convert square feet to square inches. Let me recall the conversion factors. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 square foot is \\( 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 12 \\, \\text{inches} = 144 \\, \\text{in}^2 \\). \n\nTherefore, each square foot is 144 square inches. The total surface area in square feet is 6, so multiplying by 144 will give the total surface area in square inches. Let me compute that: \\( 6 \\times 144 \\). Let's break that down: 6 times 100 is 600, 6 times 40 is 240, and 6 times 4 is 24. Adding those together: 600 + 240 = 840, plus 24 is 864. So, 6 times 144 is 864. \n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the cube is 864 square inches. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Volume of cube is 1 cubic foot. So each edge is 1 foot. Correct.\n2. Surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one face. Each face is 1x1 feet, so 1 square foot. 6 square feet. Right.\n3. Convert square feet to square inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1 square foot is 144 square inches. Multiply 6 by 144. 6*144=864. Yes, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any errors here. The key steps were converting the edge length from feet to inches correctly and then applying the surface area formula appropriately. Sometimes when converting units, especially squared units, it's easy to mix up the conversion factors, but 1 foot to inches is definitely 12, so 1 square foot is 12 squared. Yep, that checks out. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if each edge is 12 inches, then the area of each face is 12 in * 12 in = 144 in². There are 6 faces, so 6*144=864. That's the same answer. So, whether I calculate it by converting the edge length first or convert the area later, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that 864 is the correct answer. \n\nI think that's all. The problem wasn't too complicated once I broke it down step by step. Just making sure all the unit conversions are done properly, especially since the answer is required in square inches and the given volume is in cubic feet. It's easy to mix up feet and inches when dealing with squares and cubes, but taking it slow and doing each unit conversion carefully helps prevent mistakes. \n\nFinal answer should be 864 square inches. Let me write that in the required format.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total surface area of the cube is \\boxed{864} square inches.\n</think>\n\nTo find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we start by determining the side length of the cube. The volume of a cube is given by \\( V = s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, each side of the cube is 1 foot long.\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square with area \\( s^2 \\). Therefore, the surface area in square feet is:\n\\[\n6 \\times (1 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 1 \\, \\text{ft}) = 6 \\, \\text{ft}^2\n\\]\n\nWe need to convert this area to square inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 1 square foot is:\n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 12 \\, \\text{inches} = 144 \\, \\text{in}^2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the surface area in square feet by the conversion factor gives:\n\\[\n6 \\, \\text{ft}^2 \\times 144 \\, \\text{in}^2/\\text{ft}^2 = 864 \\, \\text{in}^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the total surface area of the cube is \\(\\boxed{864}\\) square inches.", "answer": "864 \\mbox{ inches}^2"}
{"original_question": "Calculez le produit du nombre $5+\\sqrt{3}$ et de son conjugué radical.", "question": "Calculez le produit du nombre $5+\\sqrt{3}$ et de son conjugué radical.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to calculate the product of the number 5 plus the square root of 3 and its radical conjugate. Hmm, let me remember what a radical conjugate is. From what I recall, the radical conjugate of an expression like a + sqrt(b) is a - sqrt(b). So in this case, the conjugate of 5 + sqrt(3) should be 5 - sqrt(3). Got that down.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the product of these two numbers. So I need to multiply (5 + sqrt(3)) by (5 - sqrt(3)). I think there's a formula for multiplying conjugates, kind of like the difference of squares. Let me check. Oh yeah, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So applying that here, where a is 5 and b is sqrt(3). \n\nLet me write that out step by step to make sure I don't mess up. First, multiply the first terms: 5 times 5 is 25. Then, the outer terms: 5 times -sqrt(3) is -5sqrt(3). Inner terms: sqrt(3) times 5 is 5sqrt(3). And the last terms: sqrt(3) times -sqrt(3) is - (sqrt(3))². \n\nWait, combining those terms: 25 -5sqrt(3) +5sqrt(3) - (sqrt(3))². The middle terms, -5sqrt(3) and +5sqrt(3), should cancel each other out because they're opposites. So that leaves 25 minus (sqrt(3)) squared. \n\nNow, (sqrt(3)) squared is just 3, right? Because squaring a square root cancels them out. So substituting that in, we have 25 - 3. Which is 22. So the product should be 22. \n\nLet me verify that again to be sure. Alternatively, using the difference of squares formula: (5)^2 - (sqrt(3))^2 = 25 - 3 = 22. Yep, that checks out. \n\nI think that's it. The radical conjugate is 5 - sqrt(3), multiplying them gives 25 - 3 = 22. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. The key was recognizing the conjugate and applying the formula correctly. Alternatively, if I were to multiply them the long way, expanding the product, it still should result in 22. Let me try that to confirm. \n\nExpanding (5 + sqrt(3))(5 - sqrt(3)):\n\nFirst term: 5*5 = 25\n\nOuter term: 5*(-sqrt(3)) = -5sqrt(3)\n\nInner term: sqrt(3)*5 = 5sqrt(3)\n\nLast term: sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3)) = - (sqrt(3))^2 = -3\n\nNow, add all those terms together: 25 -5sqrt(3) +5sqrt(3) -3. Combine like terms: 25 -3 =22, and -5sqrt(3) +5sqrt(3) =0. So total is 22. Yep, same result. \n\nOkay, so I'm confident the answer is 22. No issues here. Just making sure that the radical conjugate is indeed 5 - sqrt(3) and not something else. Since the original term is 5 + sqrt(3), changing the sign of the radical part gives the conjugate. So yes, that's correct. \n\nI guess another way to think about this is that multiplying a number and its conjugate removes the radical part, leaving a rational number. In this case, 22 is a rational number, which makes sense. So that's a good check. \n\nSo, final answer should be 22.

The first term is 1, then 3, then 5, etc.\n\nI remember that the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Let me verify that. So for the first term, when n=1, it should be 1. Plugging into the formula: 1 + (1 - 1)*2 = 1 + 0 = 1. That works. The second term, n=2: 1 + (2 - 1)*2 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that arccot(1/x) is related to arctan(x) somehow. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that connects these two inverse functions. Let me recall. \n\nI know that arccot(z) is the same as arctan(1/z) for z > 0, right? But if z is negative, then it's different. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of right triangles. For arctan(x), if I imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent side is 1, then the angle would be arctan(x). Similarly, arccot(1/x) can be thought of as the angle whose cotangent is 1/x, which would also be an angle in a right triangle where the adjacent side is 1/x and the opposite side is 1. So, if I have two angles, arctan(x) and arccot(1/x), their sum might be a special angle or something that can be simplified.\n\nWait, let's try to visualize this. Let’s denote θ = arctan(x). Then, tanθ = x. Now, arccot(1/x) is the angle φ such that cotφ = 1/x. But cotφ = adjacent/opposite = 1/x in a right triangle, so tanφ = x. Therefore, φ = arctan(x). Wait, so arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). Is that correct? Let me check with a specific value. Let's take x = 1. Then arccot(1/1) = arccot(1) = π/4, and arctan(1) = π/4. So yes, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) when x > 0. But if x < 0, then arccot(1/x) would be... Hmm, arccot(z) for negative z. The range of arccot is usually defined as (0, π), so for z < 0, arccot(z) is in (π/2, π). But arctan(z) for z < 0 is in (-π/2, 0). So perhaps arccot(1/x) is not equal to arctan(x) when x is negative. Maybe there's a sign consideration here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arccot(1/x) can be expressed as arctan(x) when x > 0, but adjusted by π when x < 0? Wait, let me think again. Let’s use the identity that arccot(z) = arctan(1/z) for z > 0, but for z < 0, arccot(z) = arctan(1/z) + π. Because cotangent is cos/sin, so if z is negative, cotφ = z < 0, which would mean that φ is in (π/2, π), so arctan(1/z) would be in (-π/2, 0), so adding π would bring it into (π/2, π). Therefore, arccot(z) = arctan(1/z) + π for z < 0.\n\nBut in our problem, we have arccot(1/x). Let's substitute z = 1/x. So if x > 0, then z = 1/x is positive, so arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). If x < 0, then z = 1/x is negative, so arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. However, arctan(x) for x < 0 is in (-π/2, 0), so adding π would give us in (π/2, π). So, in summary:\n\narccot(1/x) = {\narctan(x), if x > 0;\narctan(x) + π, if x < 0.\n}\n\nTherefore, the original expression inside the sine function is arctan(x) + arccot(1/x), which would be:\n\nIf x > 0: arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x)\nIf x < 0: arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π\n\nBut wait, let me check. If x is positive, then arccot(1/x) is arctan(x), so the sum is arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). If x is negative, arccot(1/x) is arctan(x) + π, so the sum is arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π. So the angle inside the sine function is either 2 arctan(x) or 2 arctan(x) + π depending on the sign of x.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nFor x > 0:\nsin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3\n\nFor x < 0:\nsin(2 arctan(x) + π) = 1/3\n\nBut sin(θ + π) = -sinθ, so sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = -sin(2 arctan(x)). Therefore, for x < 0, the equation becomes:\n\n-sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3 ⇒ sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3\n\nSo combining both cases:\n\nFor x > 0: sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3\n\nFor x < 0: sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3\n\nSo now, let's solve each case separately.\n\nFirst, let’s handle x > 0. Let’s set θ = arctan(x). Then θ is in (0, π/2), since x > 0. Then, sin(2θ) = 1/3. So we can write 2θ = arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = π - arcsin(1/3). Therefore, θ = (1/2) arcsin(1/3) or θ = (π - (1/2) arcsin(1/3)). But θ = arctan(x), so x = tanθ. Therefore, x = tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] or x = tan[(π - (1/2) arcsin(1/3))].\n\nSimilarly, for x < 0: sin(2θ) = -1/3, so 2θ = arcsin(-1/3) or 2θ = π - arcsin(-1/3). But arcsin(-1/3) = -arcsin(1/3), so 2θ = -arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = π + arcsin(1/3). Therefore, θ = - (1/2) arcsin(1/3) or θ = (π + (1/2) arcsin(1/3)). However, θ = arctan(x) for x < 0, so θ is in (-π/2, 0). Let's check:\n\nFirst solution: θ = - (1/2) arcsin(1/3). Since arcsin(1/3) is positive, θ is negative, which is in (-π/2, 0), so valid.\n\nSecond solution: θ = (π + (1/2) arcsin(1/3)). Let's compute this angle. π is approximately 3.1416, and (1/2) arcsin(1/3) is approximately (1/2)(0.3398) ≈ 0.1699, so total θ ≈ 3.1416 + 0.1699 ≈ 3.3115 radians, which is greater than π/2 (≈1.5708) but less than 3π/2. However, arctan(x) for x < 0 is in (-π/2, 0). So θ ≈ 3.3115 is not in (-π/2, 0). Therefore, this solution is invalid. Therefore, only θ = - (1/2) arcsin(1/3) is valid. Therefore, x = tan[- (1/2) arcsin(1/3)].\n\nBut tan(-α) = -tanα, so x = - tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)].\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nFor x > 0: two solutions: tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] and tan[(π - (1/2) arcsin(1/3))].\n\nFor x < 0: one solution: - tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)].\n\nBut wait, let's verify if these solutions are correct and if there are any restrictions.\n\nFirst, let's compute tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)]. Let’s denote α = arcsin(1/3). Then sinα = 1/3, cosα = sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = 2√2/3. Then, tan(α/2) = sinα / (1 + cosα) = (1/3) / (1 + 2√2/3) = (1/3) / ((3 + 2√2)/3) = 1 / (3 + 2√2). Similarly, rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2√2):\n\n(1)(3 - 2√2) / [(3 + 2√2)(3 - 2√2)] = (3 - 2√2) / (9 - 8) = 3 - 2√2.\n\nTherefore, tan(α/2) = 3 - 2√2. Therefore, tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] = 3 - 2√2 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172. Similarly, the other solution is tan[(π - α)/2]. Let’s compute that.\n\nLet’s denote β = π - α, so sinβ = sinα = 1/3, cosβ = -cosα = -2√2/3. Then tan(β/2) = sinβ / (1 + cosβ) = (1/3) / (1 - 2√2/3) = (1/3) / ((3 - 2√2)/3) = 1 / (3 - 2√2). Rationalize:\n\n1 / (3 - 2√2) * (3 + 2√2)/(3 + 2√2) = (3 + 2√2) / (9 - 8) = 3 + 2√2. Therefore, tan(β/2) = 3 + 2√2 ≈ 3 + 2.828 ≈ 5.828.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x > 0 are 3 - 2√2 and 3 + 2√2.\n\nFor x < 0, we have x = - tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172. But let's check if this solution is valid. Let’s substitute x = - (3 - 2√2) into the original equation.\n\nCompute arctan(x) + arccot(1/x). Since x is negative, arctan(x) is negative, arccot(1/x) is arctan(x) + π. Therefore, the sum is arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π. Then sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = -sin(2 arctan(x)). We need this to be 1/3. So -sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3 ⇒ sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3. Let's check if sin(2 arctan(- (3 - 2√2))) = -1/3.\n\nWait, maybe instead of substituting, let's verify the solution. Let’s compute x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172. Then arctan(x) ≈ arctan(-0.172) ≈ -0.171 radians. Then 2 arctan(x) ≈ -0.342 radians. Then sin(-0.342) ≈ -0.339, which is approximately -1/3. So yes, it checks out. Therefore, this solution is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 3 - 2√2, x = 3 + 2√2, and x = - (3 - 2√2) = 2√2 - 3.\n\nWait, let me note that - (3 - 2√2) is equal to -3 + 2√2, which is the same as 2√2 - 3. Since √2 ≈ 1.414, so 2√2 ≈ 2.828, so 2.828 - 3 ≈ -0.172, which matches our earlier approximation.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 3 - 2√2, x = 3 + 2√2, and x = 2√2 - 3.\n\nBut let me check if all these solutions are valid and if there are any restrictions. For example, when x = 0, but x = 0 is not in the domain because arccot(1/0) is undefined (since 1/0 is undefined). So x ≠ 0. Also, when solving sin(2 arctan(x)) = ±1/3, we need to make sure that 2 arctan(x) is within the range where sine can take that value. Since arctan(x) is between -π/2 and π/2 when x is real, 2 arctan(x) is between -π and π. However, sine is periodic with period 2π, so sin(θ) = 1/3 and sin(θ) = -1/3 have solutions in that interval. But we need to check if the solutions we found are in the correct range.\n\nWait, actually, for x > 0, θ = arctan(x) is in (0, π/2), so 2θ is in (0, π). For x < 0, θ = arctan(x) is in (-π/2, 0), so 2θ is", "answer": "3 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2}"}

Trouvez la distance entre ces deux lignes.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have two lines here, and they're supposed to be parallel. My task is to find the distance between them. Let me start by recalling what I know about lines in 3D space. \n\nFirst, both lines are given in parametric form. The first line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and the second one is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\). The problem states they are parallel, so that should be a given, which probably means I don't have to check that part. But maybe I should verify it just in case. \n\nLooking at the direction vectors: the first line has direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and the second one has \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Hmm, let me see if these are scalar multiples of each other. If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is exactly the second direction vector. So yes, they are parallel. That checks out. \n\nNow, since the lines are parallel, the distance between them isn't straightforward like the distance between skew lines. Instead, the distance should be the minimal distance between any two points on the lines. But since they're parallel, this distance can be found by taking a vector connecting any two points on the lines and then projecting it onto the direction perpendicular to the lines. \n\nWait, another way I remember is that if two lines are parallel, the distance between them is the length of the vector that connects them (from one line to the other) and is perpendicular to both lines. Since they are parallel, their direction vectors are the same (up to a scalar), so the perpendicular distance can be calculated using the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line. \n\nSo the formula for the distance \\(d\\) between two parallel lines is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}|}{|\\vec{v}|}\n\\]\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me recall. If you have two parallel lines, then the distance between them is the distance from any point on one line to the other line. To compute this, you can take the vector that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line, then take the cross product of the direction vector with this connecting vector, and then divide by the magnitude of the direction vector. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v}|}{|\\vec{v}|}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\vec{PQ}\\) is the vector connecting any two points P and Q on the two lines, and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the direction vector of the lines. \n\nYes, that sounds right. Because the cross product of \\(\\vec{PQ}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) gives a vector whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by \\(\\vec{PQ}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\), and dividing by \\(|\\vec{v}|\\) gives the height of the parallelogram, which is the distance between the lines. \n\nOkay, so let's apply this. First, I need a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's take the points when \\(t = 0\\) and \\(u = 0\\). \n\nFor the first line, when \\(t = 0\\), the point is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). For the second line, when \\(u = 0\\), the point is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\). So the vector \\(\\vec{PQ}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{PQ} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\\\ -3 - (-10) \\\\ 6 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so \\(\\vec{PQ} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). \n\nNext, the direction vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the direction vector of the lines, which we already saw is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (or the scalar multiple, but since direction vectors can be scaled, we can use either one). \n\nNow, compute the cross product \\(\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v}\\). Let me recall the cross product formula. If \\(\\vec{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\vec{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 \\\\ a_3b_1 - a_1b_3 \\\\ a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo applying that here, with \\(\\vec{PQ} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\):\n\nFirst component: \\(7*(-2) - 5*(-9) = -14 + 45 = 31\\)\n\nSecond component: \\(5*2 - (-8)*(-2) = 10 - 16 = -6\\)\n\nThird component: \\(-8*(-9) - 7*2 = 72 - 14 = 58\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 31 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 58 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is:\n\n\\[\n|\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \\sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \\sqrt{4361}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that arithmetic:\n\n31 squared: 31*31. 30*30=900, 30*1=30, 1*30=30, 1*1=1. So (30+1)^2=900 + 60 +1=961. Yes, 31²=961.\n\n(-6)²=36.\n\n58²=58*58. Let's compute 50*50=2500, 50*8=400, 8*50=400, 8*8=64. So (50+8)^2=2500 + 400 + 400 +64=2500+800+64=3364. Correct.\n\nSo adding 961 + 36 = 997, then 997 + 3364 = 4361. So sqrt(4361). Hmm, that's going to be a bit messy. Let me see if this simplifies. Let's check if 4361 is a perfect square. Let's try 66²=4356, 67²=4489. So between 66 and 67. 66²=4356, 66.5²=4422.25, so 4361 is between 66² and 66.5². So sqrt(4361) is irrational. So we can leave it as sqrt(4361) for now.\n\nThen, the magnitude of the direction vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \\sqrt{89}\n\\]\n\nSo the distance \\(d\\) is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\sqrt{4361}}{\\sqrt{89}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4361}{89}}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute 4361 divided by 89. Let's see. 89*49=89*50 -89=4450 -89=4361. Oh! So 89*49=4361. Therefore, 4361/89=49. Therefore, sqrt(49)=7. So the distance is 7. \n\nWait, that's nice! So even though the cross product magnitude was sqrt(4361), and the direction vector magnitude was sqrt(89), their ratio simplifies to 7. \n\nSo the distance between the two parallel lines is 7. \n\nLet me verify that again. So the cross product of PQ and v is (31, -6, 58), whose magnitude squared is 31² + (-6)^2 +58²=961+36+3364=4361. The magnitude of v is sqrt(89). So 4361/89=49, so sqrt(49)=7. Perfect, that checks out. \n\nTherefore, the distance between the two lines is 7. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the cross product calculation. Let me recheck:\n\n\\(\\vec{PQ} = (-8,7,5)\\), \\(\\vec{v}=(2,-9,-2)\\)\n\nCross product components:\n\ni component: (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) = -14 +45=31\n\nj component: (5)(2) - (-8)(-2)=10 -16= -6\n\nk component: (-8)(-9) - (7)(2)=72 -14=58\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (31, -6, 58). Then magnitude squared is 31² + (-6)^2 +58²=961 +36 +3364=4361. 4361 divided by 89 is indeed 49, so sqrt(49)=7. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 7. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that since the lines are parallel, the distance can be found by taking the absolute value of the scalar triple product divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Wait, scalar triple product is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors. But in this case, scalar triple product is \\(\\vec{PQ} \\cdot (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w})\\), but since the lines are parallel, maybe that's not necessary here. But in our case, we computed the cross product of PQ and v, then took its magnitude over |v|, which gives the distance. \n\nAlternatively, since they are parallel, the distance can be calculated as the distance from a point on one line to the other line. So if I take the first line, parametrized as \\(\\vec{r}_1(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ -10 \\\\1\\end{pmatrix} + t\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\-9 \\\\-2\\end{pmatrix}\\), and the second line as \\(\\vec{r}_2(u) = \\begin{pmatrix}-5 \\\\-3 \\\\6\\end{pmatrix} + u\\begin{pmatrix}4 \\\\-18 \\\\-4\\end{pmatrix}\\), which is the same as \\(\\vec{r}_2(u) = \\begin{pmatrix}-5 \\\\-3 \\\\6\\end{pmatrix} + 2u\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\-9 \\\\-2\\end{pmatrix}\\). So actually, the second line can be written as \\(\\vec{r}_2(u) = \\begin{pmatrix}-5 \\\\-3 \\\\6\\end{pmatrix} + 2u\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\-9 \\\\-2\\end{pmatrix}\\), which might make it clearer that they are parallel with direction vector 2 times the first direction vector. \n\nBut perhaps another approach is to parametrize the distance between two points on each line and then minimize it. Let me try that. \n\nTake a general point on the first line: \\(\\vec{r}_1(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}3 + 2t \\\\ -10 -9t \\\\1 -2t\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nTake a general point on the second line: \\(\\vec{r}_2(u) = \\begin{pmatrix}-5 +4u \\\\ -3 -18u \\\\6 -4u\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nThe vector between these two points is:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{d}(t, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 +4u - (3 +2t) \\\\ -3 -18u - (-10 -9t) \\\\6 -4u - (1 -2t) \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nx-component: -5 +4u -3 -2t = -8 +4u -2t\n\ny-component: -3 -18u +10 +9t =7 +9t -18u\n\nz-component:6 -4u -1 +2t =5 +2t -4u\n\nSo the vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -8 +4u -2t \\\\7 +9t -18u \\\\5 +2t -4u \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nThe distance squared between the two points is the square of this vector's magnitude:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = (-8 +4", "answer": "7"}

The vertices of the rectangle are given as (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). Hmm, let me visualize this first. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the boundaries of the rectangle. Since the coordinates are from -5 to 5 in the x-direction (from -5 to 5) and from -4 to 4 in the y-direction (from -4 to 4). But wait, the problem says \"strictly inside,\" which I think means excluding the boundary. So, points that are inside the rectangle but not on the edges.\n\nSo, for integer coordinates, the x-coordinate has to be greater than -5 and less than 5? Wait, no. If it's strictly inside, then the x-coordinates should be strictly between -5 and 5. Similarly, y-coordinates should be strictly between -4 and 4.\n\nBut how do we count that? Let me think. For a rectangle aligned with the axes, the number of integer points strictly inside can be calculated by considering the number of integer points along each axis within the range.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the rectangle is from x = -5 to x = 5, but excluding the boundaries. So the x-coordinates must satisfy -5 < x < 5. But x has to be an integer. So, the possible integer x-values would be from -4 to 4 inclusive? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nIf x must be strictly greater than -5 and strictly less than 5, then x can be -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Because if x is -5, it's on the boundary, same with 5. So that's 9 integer x-values.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinates: strictly between -4 and 4, so y has to be greater than -4 and less than 4. So y can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 integer y-values.\n\nTherefore, the total number of integer points inside would be 9 x 7 = 63. Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have inclusive counts, you have to be careful.\n\nWait, for x: from -5 to 5, but not including -5 and 5. So the integers between -5 and 5 (exclusive) are -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 numbers. Similarly for y: from -4 to 4, exclusive, so integers are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 numbers.\n\nSo 9 * 7 = 63. Therefore, the answer is 63. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me think again to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula for the number of integer points inside a rectangle is (width - 1) * (height - 1). Wait, but in this case, the width in the x-direction is from -5 to 5, which is 10 units, but since we are excluding the boundaries, it's 10 - 2 = 8? Wait, no. Wait, the width in terms of integer steps. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the rectangle spans from x = a to x = b, then the number of integer x-coordinates strictly inside would be (b - a - 1). Similarly for y. So here, a is -5, b is 5 for x. So (5 - (-5) - 1) = 10 - 1 = 9. Wait, but that's the same as before. Similarly, for y, the span is from -4 to 4, so (4 - (-4) -1) = 8 -1 =7. So 9*7=63. Yep, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall the formula for lattice points in a rectangle: the number of interior points is (number of integer points along the x-axis minus 2) multiplied by (number along y-axis minus 2). Since the rectangle has length 10 (from -5 to 5) and height 8 (from -4 to 4). But actually, the number of integer points along the x-axis would be 10 (from -5 to 5 inclusive), but excluding the two endpoints, it's 8. Wait, no. Wait, the number of integer points along the x-axis from -5 to 5 inclusive is 11 (since 5 - (-5) +1 =11). But if we exclude the endpoints, it's 11 -2=9. Similarly, along the y-axis from -4 to 4 inclusive is 9 points, excluding the endpoints gives 7. So again, 9*7=63.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 63. But let me check with a small example to make sure.\n\nSuppose we have a rectangle from (1,1) to (3,3). The interior points would be (2,2). So 1 point. Using the formula: (3-1-1)*(3-1-1)=1*1=1. Correct. Another example: from (0,0) to (2,2). The interior points would be (1,1). Again, 1. If we do (2-0-1)*(2-0-1)=1*1=1. Correct. If the rectangle is from (0,0) to (3,3), the interior points would be (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). That's 4 points. Using the formula: (3-0-1)*(3-0-1)=2*2=4. Correct. So the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem: the width is 5 - (-5) =10, so interior x-values are 10 -2=8? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (b - a -1). For x from -5 to 5, so (5 - (-5) -1)=10 -1=9. Similarly, y from -4 to 4, (4 - (-4)-1)=8 -1=7. 9*7=63. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of integer points strictly inside the rectangle is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integer points strictly inside the region is \\boxed{63}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangular region with vertices at \\((5,4)\\), \\((-5,4)\\), \\((-5,-4)\\), and \\((5,-4)\\), we need to consider the ranges for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-coordinates that exclude the boundaries.\n\n1. **Identify the range for \\(x\\)-coordinates**:\n   - The region spans from \\(x = -5\\) to \\(x = 5\\).\n   - Excluding the boundaries, the integer \\(x\\)-coordinates must be strictly between \\(-5\\) and \\(5\\).\n   - The valid integer values for \\(x\\) are \\(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\), which gives 9 possible values.\n\n2. **Identify the range for \\(y\\)-coordinates**:\n   - The region spans from \\(y = -4\\) to \\(y = 4\\).\n   - Excluding the boundaries, the integer \\(y\\)-coordinates must be strictly between \\(-4\\) and \\(4\\).\n   - The valid integer values for \\(y\\) are \\(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\), which gives 7 possible values.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of integer points**:\n   - The total number of points is the product of the number of valid \\(x\\)-coordinates and the number of valid \\(y\\)-coordinates.\n   - This is \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\).\n\nThus, the number of integer points strictly inside the region is \\(\\boxed{63}\\).", "answer": "63"}

Let me recall that the cross product has some distributive properties over vector addition and scalar multiplication. Specifically, for any vectors u, v, w and scalars k, m, we have:\n\nu × (v + w) = u × v + u × w\n(ku) × v = k(u × v)\nSimilarly, (u + v) × w = u × w + v × w and u × (kv) = k(u × v)\n\nSo applying these properties, I can expand the expression (2b - a) × (3c + a).\n\nFirst, let me distribute the cross product over the terms inside the parentheses. Let's denote the two vectors as (2b - a) and (3c + a). So:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = (2b × 3c) + (2b × a) + (-a × 3c) + (-a × a)\n\nNow, let's handle each term step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term: 2b × 3c. Using the scalar multiplication property, this is (2*3)(b × c) = 6(b × c). Similarly, the second term is 2b × a, which can be written as 2(b × a). The third term is -a × 3c, which is -3(a × c). The fourth term is -a × a. \n\nBut wait, a cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So a × a = 0. Therefore, the fourth term is -a × a = 0. So that term drops out.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to:\n\n6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c)\n\nNow, let's recall the anti-commutative property of cross products: u × v = -v × u. Therefore, (b × a) = - (a × b). Similarly, (a × c) is already given.\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n6(b × c) + 2(- (a × b)) - 3(a × c) = 6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given cross products. From the problem statement:\n\na × b = [6, -7, 3]\na × c = [4, 7, 2]\nb × c = [1, -7, 18]\n\nTherefore, substituting these values:\n\n6*( [1, -7, 18] ) - 2*( [6, -7, 3] ) - 3*( [4, 7, 2] )\n\nNow, let's compute each scalar multiplication:\n\nFirst term: 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term: -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-2*6, -2*(-7), -2*3] = [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term: -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-3*4, -3*7, -3*2] = [-12, -21, -6]\n\nNow, adding these three resulting vectors together:\n\nFirst, add the first and second terms:\n\n[6, -42, 108] + [-12, 14, -6] = (6 - 12, -42 + 14, 108 - 6) = (-6, -28, 102)\n\nThen, add the third term to this result:\n\n(-6, -28, 102) + [-12, -21, -6] = (-6 -12, -28 -21, 102 -6) = (-18, -49, 96)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) equals the vector (-18, -49, 96).\n\nWait, let me double-check the arithmetic to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108) – correct.\n\nSecond term: -2*(6, -7, 3) = (-12, 14, -6) – correct.\n\nThird term: -3*(4, 7, 2) = (-12, -21, -6) – correct.\n\nAdding first and second terms:\n\n6 -12 = -6\n\n-42 +14 = -28\n\n108 -6 = 102. So that gives (-6, -28, 102). Then adding the third term:\n\n-6 -12 = -18\n\n-28 -21 = -49\n\n102 -6 = 96. So (-18, -49, 96). That seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check each component again:\n\nFor the x-component:\n\n6*1 (from first term) + (-12) (from second term) + (-12) (from third term) = 6 -12 -12 = -18. Correct.\n\nY-component:\n\n6*(-7) = -42; 14 (from second term); -21 (from third term). So -42 +14 -21 = (-42 +14) = -28; -28 -21 = -49. Correct.\n\nZ-component:\n\n6*18 = 108; -6 (from second term); -6 (from third term). So 108 -6 -6 = 96. Correct.\n\nLooks like all the arithmetic checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be (-18, -49, 96). Let me just confirm that the problem didn't require any further simplification or if there's a different form expected, but since they just ask for the cross product, this should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the cross product \\((2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a})\\), we use the distributive properties of the cross product over vector addition and scalar multiplication. \n\nFirst, we expand the expression:\n\\[\n(2 \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{a}) \\times (3 \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{a}) = 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} + 2 \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a}\n\\]\n\nUsing scalar multiplication properties:\n\\[\n2 \\mathbf{b} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} = 6 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} = 2 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a}) = -2 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b})\n\\]\n\\[\n- \\mathbf{a} \\times 3 \\mathbf{c} = -3 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c})\n\\]\n\\[\n- \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given cross products:\n\\[\n6 (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) - 2 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}) - 3 (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c})\n\\]\n\nUsing the given values:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n6 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n-2 \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n-3 \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAdding these vectors together:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -42 \\\\ 108 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 14 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ -21 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]", "answer": "\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}"}

Arrondissez votre réponse au dixième de centime le plus proche.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Juan's stamp collection, right? He organizes his stamps by country and decade of issue. The question is asking for the average price per stamp in the 1970s, in centimes, rounded to the nearest tenth. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how much he spent on stamps from Brazil and Peru in the 1970s, since those are the countries mentioned for that decade. \n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, there's a table provided. Let me parse the labels. The vertical lines are for each decade: 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The horizontal lines are for each country. The countries mentioned are Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain. Each cell in the table probably represents the number of stamps for that country in that decade. \n\nSo, for the 1970s (which I guess is the 1970s, so the third vertical line from the left, labeled \"70s\"), the countries are Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. The numbers given are 12, 12, 6, 13. Let me confirm: the Asymptote code says for the 70s:\n\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"12\", (13.5,3.5));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"12\", (13.5,2.5));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"6\", (13.5,1.5));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"13\", (13.5,0.5));\n\nYes, so Brazil has 12 stamps, France has 12, Peru has 6, and Spain has 13 in the 1970s. Each of these numbers is the count of stamps from each country in that decade. \n\nNow, the prices per stamp are given. The problem states: Brésil (Brazil) and France, 6 centimes each; Peru, 4 centimes each; and Spain, 5 centimes each. So, Brazil and France are in the 60s, but in the 1970s, Brazil is still Brazil (Brésil is just a spelling variation), France, and Peru and Spain are the same countries. \n\nSo, for the 1970s, the price per stamp for Brazil (and hence Brésil, since it's the same country) is 6 centimes, France is 6 centimes, Peru is 4 centimes, and Spain is 5 centimes. \n\nTherefore, to find the total cost for each country in the 1970s, we need to multiply the number of stamps by the price per stamp. Then, add up all those totals to get the overall cost for the 1970s. Then, divide that total by the total number of stamps in the 1970s to get the average price per stamp. \n\nLet me write down the numbers:\n\nCountry | Number of Stamps | Price per Stamp (centimes) | Total Cost (centimes)\n---|---|---|---\nBrazil | 12 | 6 | 12*6 = 72\nFrance | 12 | 6 | 12*6 = 72\nPeru | 6 | 4 | 6*4 = 24\nSpain | 13 | 5 | 13*5 = 65\n\nNow, let's calculate each total:\n\n- Brazil: 12 * 6 = 72\n- France: 12 * 6 = 72\n- Peru: 6 * 4 = 24\n- Spain: 13 * 5 = 65\n\nAdding these up: 72 + 72 = 144; 144 + 24 = 168; 168 + 65 = 233. So the total cost in the 1970s is 233 centimes.\n\nTotal number of stamps in the 1970s: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13. Let's add those: 12 + 12 = 24; 24 + 6 = 30; 30 + 13 = 43. So 43 stamps.\n\nTherefore, the average price per stamp is total cost divided by number of stamps: 233 / 43.\n\nLet me compute that division. 233 divided by 43. Let's see:\n\n43 * 5 = 215. 233 - 215 = 18. So 5 with a remainder of 18. So 5 + 18/43. Let's convert 18/43 to a decimal. \n\n18 ÷ 43. Let's do this division. 43 goes into 18 zero times. Add a decimal point. 43 goes into 180 four times (43*4=172). Subtract 172 from 180: 8. Bring down a zero: 80. 43 goes into 80 once (43*1=43). Subtract: 80 - 43 = 37. Bring down a zero: 370. 43 goes into 370 eight times (43*8=344). Subtract: 370 - 344 = 26. Bring down a zero: 260. 43 goes into 260 six times (43*6=258). Subtract: 260 - 258 = 2. Bring down a zero: 20. 43 goes into 20 zero times. Bring down another zero: 200. 43 goes into 200 four times (43*4=172). Subtract: 200 - 172 = 28. Bring down a zero: 280. 43 goes into 280 six times (43*6=258). Subtract: 280 - 258 = 22. Bring down a zero: 220. 43 goes into 220 five times (43*5=215). Subtract: 220 - 215 = 5. Bring down a zero: 50. 43 goes into 50 once (43*1=43). Subtract: 50 - 43 = 7. Bring down a zero: 70. 43 goes into 70 once (43*1=43). Subtract: 70 - 43 = 27. Bring down a zero: 270. 43 goes into 270 six times (43*6=258). Subtract: 270 - 258 = 12. Bring down a zero: 120. 43 goes into 120 two times (43*2=86). Subtract: 120 - 86 = 34. Bring down a zero: 340. 43 goes into 340 seven times (43*7=301). Subtract: 340 - 301 = 39. Bring down a zero: 390. 43 goes into 390 nine times (43*9=387). Subtract: 390 - 387 = 3. So we're starting to see a repeating decimal.\n\nSo, 18/43 ≈ 0.41860465116... So approximately 0.4186. Therefore, 233/43 ≈ 5.4186 centimes. \n\nRounded to the nearest tenth of a centime, that would be 5.4 centimes. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. Maybe I made an error in division. Let me verify 233 divided by 43.\n\n43*5 = 215. 233 - 215 = 18. So 5 with 18 remainder. 18/43. Let me use another method. Maybe convert both numerator and denominator to centimes. Wait, 233 centimes divided by 43 stamps. \n\nAlternatively, 233 ÷ 43. Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\n43 × 5 = 215. 233 - 215 = 18. So 5.418... So yes, approximately 5.418. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 5.4. Because the next digit is 1, which is less than 5, so it stays 5.4. \n\nSo the average price per stamp in the 1970s was 5.4 centimes. \n\nBut let me double-check the total cost and the number of stamps again. \n\nBrazil: 12 stamps at 6 centimes each: 12*6 = 72. \n\nFrance: 12*6 = 72. \n\nPeru: 6*4 = 24. \n\n Spain: 13*5 = 65. \n\nTotal: 72 + 72 = 144; 144 +24=168; 168+65=233. Correct. \n\nTotal stamps: 12+12+6+13=43. Correct. \n\n233 divided by 43. Let me check with another method. 43*5.4 = 43*5 + 43*0.4 = 215 + 17.2 = 232.2. Hmm, that's close to 233. 232.2 vs 233, difference is 0.8. So 5.4 + 0.8/43 ≈ 5.4 + 0.0186 ≈ 5.4186. So 5.4186, which rounds to 5.4. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.4 centimes. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"arrondissez vostre réponse au dixème de centime le plus proche.\" So, to the nearest tenth of a centime. So 5.4186... is approximately 5.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Correct. \n\nI think that's it. So the average price per stamp in the 1970s was 5.4 centimes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5.4}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price per stamp in the 1970s for Juan's collection, we need to calculate the total cost of stamps from Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain during that decade and divide it by the total number of stamps.\n\nThe number of stamps and their respective prices are as follows:\n- **Brazil (Brésil)**: 12 stamps at 6 centimes each\n- **France**: 12 stamps at 6 centimes each\n- **Peru**: 6 stamps at 4 centimes each\n- **Spain**: 13 stamps at 5 centimes each\n\nCalculating the total cost for each country:\n- Brazil: \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\) centimes\n- France: \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\) centimes\n- Peru: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) centimes\n- Spain: \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\) centimes\n\nSumming these totals gives the overall cost for the 1970s:\n\\[72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233\\] centimes\n\nThe total number of stamps in the 1970s is:\n\\[12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43\\]\n\nThe average price per stamp is then calculated by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:\n\\[\n\\frac{233}{43} \\approx 5.4186\n\\]\n\nRounding this value to the nearest tenth of a centime gives:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.4}\n\\]", "answer": "5.4 \\text{ cents}"}

I have this trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. The problem says that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects the angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid ABCD is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, the bases are AD and BC. The legs are AB and CD. Now, AC is a diagonal that is perpendicular to CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. That seems important. Maybe I can use some properties of angle bisectors here.\n\nLet me start by drawing a diagram. AD and BC are the two bases. Let me label the vertices such that A is the bottom-left, B is the top-left, C is the top-right, and D is the bottom-right. So AD is the left base, BC is the right base, AB is the left leg, and CD is the right leg. AC is the diagonal from A to C, which is perpendicular to CD. So AC ⊥ CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD, so angle BAC equals angle CAD.\n\nSince AC is an angle bisector, maybe I can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the divided opposite sides. In triangle ABD, if AC is the bisector of angle BAD, then AB/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but I need to confirm which triangle we're talking about. Actually, since AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD in the trapezoid, which is a quadrilateral, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD? Wait, not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABD, angle at A is being bisected by AC. Then the Angle Bisector Theorem would state that AB/AD = BC/CD. Wait, but BC and CD are sides of the trapezoid, not necessarily of triangle ABD. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. Maybe I need to consider triangle ACD instead. Wait, AC is perpendicular to CD, so triangle ACD is a right triangle. That might be useful.\n\nGiven that AC is perpendicular to CD, so triangle ACD is right-angled at C. So the area of triangle ACD would be (1/2)*AC*CD. Since the problem asks for [ACD], this seems like a good formula. So if I can find AC and CD, I can compute the area.\n\nAlso, the area of the trapezoid ABCD is 42. The area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. The height here would be the distance between the two bases AD and BC. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, and CD is a leg of the trapezoid, maybe the height of the trapezoid is equal to AC? Wait, not necessarily. The height is the perpendicular distance between AD and BC. If AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg, then the height could be related to AC, but I need to be careful.\n\nWait, let's clarify. In a trapezoid, the height is the distance between the two bases. If the trapezoid is not necessarily isosceles, the legs can have different lengths and the height can be found by dropping a perpendicular from one base to the other. Here, AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg, but it's not necessarily the height of the trapezoid because CD is a leg, but the height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. So maybe AC is not the height unless CD is perpendicular to both bases, which it's not necessarily. So AC is a diagonal that is perpendicular to the leg CD, but the height of the trapezoid is the distance between AD and BC.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Let's try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AD is one of the bases, let's assume AD is horizontal for simplicity. So point A would be at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Then BC is parallel to AD, so BC is also horizontal. Let me denote point C as (c, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Then point B would be at (b, h), because BC is parallel to AD and has the same length as BC. Wait, but actually, in a trapezoid, the lengths of the bases can be different. So if AD is length, say, b - a, and BC is length c - b, but maybe this is complicating things. Alternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg, so CD is the leg from C to D, which is from (c, h) to (0,0). So CD has coordinates from (c, h) to (0,0). The slope of CD would be (h - 0)/(c - 0) = h/c. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the slope of AC times the slope of CD should be -1.\n\nSo AC is from A (a, 0) to C (c, h). The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(c - a) = h/(c - a). The slope of CD is h/c. Therefore, their product should be -1:\n\n(h/(c - a)) * (h/c) = -1\n\nSo (h²)/(c(c - a)) = -1\n\nBut h² is positive, and c(c - a) must be negative for the product to be -1. Therefore, c(c - a) < 0. So this implies that either c > 0 and (c - a) < 0, meaning c < a, or c < 0 and (c - a) > 0, but since lengths are positive, c is probably positive. So c < a. Therefore, c is between 0 and a.\n\nSo we have (h²)/(c(c - a)) = -1, which implies h² = -c(c - a) = c(a - c)\n\nSo h² = c(a - c)\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's think about that. Angle BAD is the angle at point A between BA and AD. Since AD is horizontal (from (a,0) to (0,0)), the direction of AD is to the left. BA is from A (a,0) to B (b, h). Wait, but in the trapezoid, BC is parallel to AD, so BC is horizontal. Therefore, point B is at (b, h), and since BC is parallel to AD, which is horizontal, then BC has length (c - b), but since AD is from (a,0) to (0,0), length a. Wait, maybe I need to adjust my coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to set up the coordinate system such that AD is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (d,0), and BC is parallel to AD, so it's along some line y = h, from (e, h) to (f, h). Then the trapezoid has vertices A(0,0), D(d,0), C(f, h), B(e, h). Then AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(f, h). This might be a better coordinate system.\n\nGiven that, AC is perpendicular to CD. CD is from C(f, h) to D(d,0). The slope of CD is (0 - h)/(d - f) = -h/(d - f). The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(f - 0) = h/f. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(h/f) * (-h/(d - f)) = -1\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-h²)/(f(d - f)) = -1\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nh²/(f(d - f)) = 1\n\nTherefore, h² = f(d - f)\n\nThat's equation (1).\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's find the angle bisector. Point A is at (0,0). BA is from A(0,0) to B(e, h), and AD is from A(0,0) to D(d,0). The angle bisector of angle BAD is AC. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. In other words, AB/AD = BC/CD.\n\nWait, in the Angle Bisector Theorem, for a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But here, we have a trapezoid, not a triangle. However, if we consider triangle ABD, but AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD. Wait, actually, in the trapezoid, AC connects A to C, which is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I need to consider triangle ABC or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, the ratio of the adjacent sides AB and AD should be equal to the ratio of the segments created by the bisector on the opposite side. But in this case, the opposite side is BD? Wait, no. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, the angle bisector from A(0,0) to C(f, h) should satisfy the angle bisector condition. The direction vector of AB is (e, h), and the direction vector of AD is (d, 0). The angle bisector direction vector should be a combination of these two. The Angle Bisector Theorem in vector terms might help here. Alternatively, using the formula for the angle bisector in coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the angle bisector condition can be expressed in terms of the slopes. The angle between AB and AC should be equal to the angle between AD and AC.\n\nLet me compute the slopes. The slope of AB is (h - 0)/(e - 0) = h/e. The slope of AD is (0 - 0)/(d - 0) = 0, since it's along the x-axis. The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(f - 0) = h/f.\n\nThe angle between AB and AC should equal the angle between AD and AC. The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|.\n\nSo, tan(theta1) = |(h/f - h/e)/(1 + (h/f)(h/e))|\n\nSimilarly, tan(theta2) = |(h/f - 0)/(1 + (h/f)*0)| = |h/f|\n\nSince the angles are equal, tan(theta1) = tan(theta2). Therefore,\n\n|(h/f - h/e)/(1 + (h²)/(f e))| = |h/f|\n\nAssuming all slopes are positive (since the points are ordered), we can drop the absolute values:\n\n(h/f - h/e)/(1 + (h²)/(f e)) = h/f\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + (h²)/(f e)):\n\nh/f - h/e = (h/f)(1 + (h²)/(f e))\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nh/f + (h³)/(f² e)\n\nSo left side: h/f - h/e\n\nTherefore:\n\nh/f - h/e = h/f + (h³)/(f² e)\n\nSubtract h/f from both sides:\n\n- h/e = (h³)/(f² e)\n\nMultiply both sides by e:\n\n- h = (h³)/f²\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h ≠ 0):\n\n-1 = h² / f²\n\nTherefore, h² = -f²\n\nBut h and f are real numbers, so h² = -f² implies h = 0 and f = 0, which can't be since h is the height of the trapezoid. This is a contradiction. Hmm, so maybe my assumption that the angles are equal in terms of tan(theta1) = tan(theta2) is leading to a contradiction, which suggests I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the angle bisector in terms of vectors. The direction vector of AB is (e, h), and the direction vector of AD is (d, 0). The angle bisector direction vector is (f, h). The angle bisector should satisfy the condition that the unit vectors in the directions of AB and AD add up to the unit vector in the direction of AC.\n\nSo, unit vector of AB: (e, h)/sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nUnit vector of AD: (d, 0)/d = (1, 0)\n\nSum of unit vectors: (e/sqrt(e² + h²) + 1, h/sqrt(e² + h²))\n\nThis should be proportional to the direction vector of AC: (f, h)\n\nTherefore,\n\n(e/sqrt(e² + h²) + 1)/f = (h/sqrt(e² + h²))/h\n\nSimplify the right side: 1/sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nTherefore,\n\n(e/sqrt(e² + h²) + 1)/f = 1/sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nMultiply both sides by f:\n\ne/sqrt(e² + h²) + 1 = f/sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(e² + h²):\n\ne + sqrt(e² + h²) = f\n\nTherefore,\n\nf = e + sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating f, e, and h.\n\nBut we also have from the perpendicularity condition h² = f(d - f) (equation 1). So maybe we can combine these equations.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's see if we can find another relation.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 42. The area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. In this coordinate system, AD is the length from (0,0) to (d,0), so AD = d. BC is from (e, h) to (f, h), so BC = f - e. The height is h. Therefore:\n\nArea = (1/2)*(d + (f - e))*h = 42\n\nSo,\n\n(d + f - e)*h = 84\n\nThat's equation (2).\n\nWe also have from the angle bisector condition:\n\nf = e + sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nAnd from the perpendicularity condition:\n\nh² = f(d - f)\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1. h² = f(d - f)\n\n2. (d + f - e)*h = 84\n\n3. f = e + sqrt(e² + h²)\n\nThis is a system of three equations with four variables: d, e, f, h. But since we are looking for the area of triangle ACD, which", "answer": "28"}

I have this equation: the square root of 2x divided by the square root of (3x minus 1) equals 3 over 2. I need to solve for x. Hmm, radicals in the equation. Alright, step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. That usually helps. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, starting with the equation:\n√(2x) / √(3x - 1) = 3/2\n\nIf I square both sides, that should get rid of the denominators inside the square roots. Let's try that.\n\n(√(2x) / √(3x - 1))² = (3/2)²\n\nSimplifying the left side: (√(2x))² / (√(3x - 1))² = 2x / (3x - 1)\nAnd the right side: 9/4\n\nSo now the equation is:\n2x / (3x - 1) = 9/4\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for x. Let's cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\nMultiply both sides by (3x - 1) and by 4 to get rid of denominators.\n\n4 * 2x = 9 * (3x - 1)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLeft side: 8x\nRight side: 27x - 9\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n8x = 27x - 9\n\nNow, subtract 27x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.\n\n8x - 27x = -9\n-19x = -9\n\nDivide both sides by -19:\n\nx = (-9)/(-19) = 9/19\n\nWait, so x is 9/19? Let me check if that's correct. Sometimes when you square both sides, you might introduce extraneous solutions, so it's good to verify.\n\nLet's substitute x = 9/19 into the original equation and see if both sides equal.\n\nFirst, compute the left side: √(2x) / √(3x - 1)\n\nCalculate 2x: 2*(9/19) = 18/19\n\nSo √(18/19)\n\nThen compute 3x -1: 3*(9/19) -1 = 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19\n\nSo √(8/19)\n\nNow, the left side is √(18/19) / √(8/19) = √(18/19) * √(19/8) = √(18/8) = √(9/4) = 3/2\n\nWhich is equal to the right side, 3/2. So that checks out. Therefore, x = 9/19 is indeed the solution.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my algebra when I squared both sides. Sometimes even if the solution checks out, there might be a mistake in the steps.\n\nOriginal equation: √(2x)/(√(3x -1)) = 3/2\n\nSquared both sides: (2x)/(3x -1) = 9/4. Then cross-multiplied to get 8x = 27x -9. Then -19x = -9, so x = 9/19. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAnd when substituting back in, everything works out. So I think that's the correct answer.

The problem gives me specific fractions: 7/30 @ 10/21. I need to simplify the result. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the operation correctly. The operation @ takes two fractions, m/n and p/q, and when applied, it multiplies the numerators m and p, and then multiplies by q/n. Wait, but the fractions need to be in their simplest form. The second fraction here is 10/21. Let me check if that's already in simplest form. 10 and 21 have no common factors besides 1, right? 10 is 2*5, 21 is 3*7. So yes, 10/21 is simplified. That's good.\n\nSo applying the operation: (7/30) @ (10/21) = (7)(10)(21/30). Let me write that out numerically. So m is 7, n is 30, p is 10, q is 21. Plugging into the formula: 7 * 10 * (21/30). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 7 * 10. That's 70. Then multiply by 21/30. So 70 * (21/30). Hmm, maybe simplify 21/30 first. 21 divided by 3 is 7, 30 divided by 3 is 10. So 21/30 simplifies to 7/10. So now the expression becomes 70 * (7/10). Let's compute that. 70 divided by 10 is 7, so 7 * 7 is 49. So does that mean the result is 49?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let's go through each step again.\n\nStarting with (7/30) @ (10/21) = (7)(10)(21/30). So numerators: 7*10=70. Then multiply by 21/30. So 70*(21/30). Let's compute 21/30. That's 0.7, but perhaps better to reduce the fraction. 21 and 30 have a common factor of 3. 21 ÷3=7, 30 ÷3=10. So 21/30=7/10. Therefore, 70*(7/10). 70 divided by 10 is 7, 7*7=49. So yes, 49. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there's a different way to approach this. Let me think. The formula says (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). So m=7, n=30, p=10, q=21. So substituting, we have (7)(10)(21/30) = 7*10*21/30. Let's compute numerator first: 7*10=70, then 70*21. Let me compute 70*21. 70*20=1400, plus 70*1=70, so 1400+70=1470. Then denominator is 30. So 1470 divided by 30. Let's divide 1470 by 30. 30*40=1200, 1470-1200=270. 30*9=270. So total is 40+9=49. So again, 49. Same result.\n\nSo seems like 49 is the answer. But let me check once more to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the operation. The problem says \"for the fractions simplified p/q\". Wait, the operation is defined as (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n), where p/q is simplified. So the formula uses the simplified form of p/q, which is already given as p/q. So in this case, since 10/21 is already simplified, we just use p=10, q=21. So no issues there. So yes, substituting into the formula gives us 7*10*(21/30)=7*10*(7/10)=7*7=49.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is m*p*(q/n). So m is 7, p is 10, q is 21, n is 30. So 7*10*(21/30). 21/30 can be simplified as 7/10, so 7*10*(7/10). The 10 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving 7*7=49. Yep.\n\nAnother way: Let's compute 21/30 first. 21 divided by 30 is 0.7. Then 7*10*0.7. 7*10=70, 70*0.7=49. Yep.\n\nSo all approaches lead to 49. Therefore, the simplified value is 49.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if 49 can be simplified further. 49 is 7 squared, so it's a prime number squared. So 49/1 is already in simplest form. So the answer is 49.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. All steps check out, and multiple methods confirm the same result. So I'm confident the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified value is \\boxed{49}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\(\\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21}\\) using the defined operation \\(\\frac{m}{n} @ \\frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\\left(\\frac{q}{n}\\right)\\), we follow these steps:\n\n1.

I remember that when dealing with random points on a circle, the positions are usually considered independent and uniformly distributed. So each point is randomly placed on the circumference, and their positions don't affect each other. The question is about the probability that the two chords AB and CD intersect each other inside the circle.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how chords intersect on a circle. If you have two chords, they intersect inside the circle if and only if the four endpoints are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if you go around the circle, the order is A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C, or any rotation of that. So, for example, if the points are ordered A, B, C, D as you go around the circle, the chords AB and CD don't intersect. But if they're ordered A, C, B, D, then AB and CD cross each other.\n\nSo, the key here is the order of the four points around the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, the probability that they are arranged in such an alternating order is the key to solving the problem.\n\nLet me think. For four distinct points on a circle, the number of possible orderings is 4! = 24. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, we can fix one point's position and consider the relative positions of the other three. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of permutations around the circle.\n\nWait, actually, when dealing with circular permutations, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! for n objects. So for four points, it would be 3! = 6 distinct arrangements. But since the circle can be rotated, the starting point doesn't matter. However, in this case, the chords AB and CD are fixed once the points are placed. But how does the order affect the crossing?\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of considering all possible permutations, think about choosing four points on the circle and then the probability that when you connect AB and CD, they cross.\n\nAnother approach: fix point A at some position (since the circle is rotationally symmetric, we can fix A without loss of generality). Then, the positions of B, C, D are random on the circumference. The chord AB is then from A to B. The chord CD is from C to D. For AB and CD to intersect, the points must be arranged such that C and D are on opposite arcs created by AB.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. If I fix A and B on the circle, then the circle is divided into two arcs: the minor arc AB and the major arc AB. For CD to intersect AB, C and D must be on different arcs. That is, one on the minor arc AB and one on the major arc AB. If both C and D are on the same arc, then the chord CD won't cross AB.\n\nSo, given that A and B are fixed, the probability that C and D are on different arcs. Since the points are chosen uniformly and independently, the probability that C is on the minor arc AB is equal to the length of the minor arc divided by the circumference. Similarly for D. But since we are dealing with probabilities, maybe we can normalize the circumference to 1.\n\nWait, but if we fix A and B, the length of the minor arc AB is a random variable, right? Because the positions of A and B are also random. Wait, but earlier I fixed A, but actually, since the points are chosen randomly, the positions of A, B, C, D are all independent. So perhaps fixing A is okay because of rotational symmetry.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's consider the circle with circumference 1. Let’s fix point A at 0. Then, points B, C, D are uniformly random in [0,1). The chord AB will then be from 0 to B. The chord CD will be from C to D. For these chords to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one of C or D is in the interval [0, B) and the other is in [B, 1). So, given that B is a random variable, we can compute the probability over all possible B.\n\nAlternatively, since all points are independent and uniformly random, maybe the probability is the same regardless of the position of A. So we can fix A at 0, and then B, C, D are three independent uniform points on [0,1). Then, we can compute the probability that C and D are on opposite sides of B.\n\nBut actually, if we fix A at 0, then B is uniform in [0,1). Then, given B, the probability that C and D are on different arcs determined by B is equal to the probability that one is less than B and the other is greater than B. Since C and D are independent, the probability that C < B is B, and the probability that D < B is B, and similarly for D > B. So the probability that C and D are on different sides of B is 2 * B * (1 - B). Then, since B is uniform over [0,1), we need to integrate this probability over B from 0 to 1.\n\nSo the total probability would be the integral from 0 to 1 of 2B(1 - B) dB. Let's compute that:\n\n∫₀¹ 2B(1 - B) dB = 2 ∫₀¹ (B - B²) dB = 2 [ (B²/2 - B³/3) ] from 0 to 1 = 2 [ (1/2 - 1/3) - 0 ] = 2 [ 1/6 ] = 1/3.\n\nWait, so is the probability 1/3? But I remember hearing that the probability is 1/3 or 1/6? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. If we fix A at 0, and B is uniform in [0,1). Then, given B, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2B(1 - B). Then, since B is uniform, the expected value of 2B(1 - B) over B is 1/3. So the probability would be 1/3. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since all four points are distinct, the probability that they are arranged in an alternating order (A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C, etc.) around the circle. For four distinct points on a circle, the number of possible orderings is 4! = 24, but considering rotational symmetry, we can fix A's position, so there are 3! = 6 possible orderings. For the chords AB and CD to intersect, the order must be such that C and D are interleaved with A and B. So how many such orderings are there?\n\nIf we fix A at position 1 (for simplicity), then the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the order is A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. Wait, but there are two such possibilities. So out of 6 possible orderings, 2 result in intersecting chords. Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nAh, that matches the previous result. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with another approach. Suppose we fix four points on the circle. The probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that when you connect the four points, the two chords cross each other. Since the four points are in general position (assuming no three points are colinear, which they aren't on a circle), the two chords intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order.\n\nThere are 4! = 24 possible orderings of the four points around the circle. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, we can fix one point's position, say A, and consider the order of B, C, D relative to A. Fixing A, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the remaining three points. For each of these orderings, we can determine if AB and CD intersect.\n\nFor example, if the order is A, B, C, D, then AB is adjacent to B, and CD is adjacent to C and D. These chords don't intersect. If the order is A, C, B, D, then AB connects A to B, passing through the interior, and CD connects C to D, which would cross AB. Similarly, A, D, B, C would also result in intersecting chords. So for each fixed A, there are 2 favorable orderings out of 6 possible. Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that once points A and B are chosen, the remaining two points C and D are equally likely to be in any of the four arcs determined by A and B. Wait, but actually, if we fix A and B, the circle is divided into two arcs: the minor arc AB and the major arc AB. The positions of C and D are independent and uniform. The probability that C and D are on opposite arcs is equal to the probability that one is on the minor arc and the other is on the major arc. Since the arcs are of length L and 1 - L, where L is the length of the minor arc AB. But since L is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1/2, perhaps?\n\nWait, actually, if we fix A and B, the length of the minor arc AB is a random variable. But since all points are chosen independently, the positions of C and D are uniform, independent of A and B. So given A and B, C and D are two uniform random variables on the circle. The probability that C and D are on opposite arcs determined by AB is equal to the probability that one is on the minor arc AB and the other is on the major arc AB. Since the minor arc AB has length L and the major arc has length 1 - L. Since L is the minimum of the two arcs, but since AB is a chord, L is between 0 and 1/2. However, since A and B are chosen randomly, L is actually uniformly distributed between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. The length of the minor arc AB when two points are chosen uniformly at random on the circle is a Beta distribution. Specifically, the distribution of the minor arc length L is f(l) = 2 for 0 < l < 1/2. So it's uniform over (0, 1/2). Hmm, okay. So given L, the probability that C is in the minor arc AB is L, and the probability that D is in the minor arc AB is L. Therefore, the probability that C and D are on opposite arcs is 2 * L * (1 - L). Then, since L is uniformly distributed over (0, 1/2), we need to compute the expectation of 2L(1 - L) over L ~ Beta(1,1) on (0, 1/2). Wait, but actually, L is uniform over (0, 1/2). So the expectation would be ∫₀^(1/2) 2L(1 - L) * 2 dL. Wait, because the probability density function for L is 2 on (0, 1/2). So the is it?\n\nWait, actually, when you fix two points A and B on the circle, the length of the minor arc AB is L, which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1/2. So the probability density function of L is 2 on (0, 1/2). Therefore, the expected value of 2L(1 - L) would be ∫₀^(1/2) 2L(1 - L) * 2 dL. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand 2L(1 - L) = 2L - 2L². Then multiply by 2 (the density):\n\n∫₀^(1/2) (2L - 2L²) * 2 dL = 4 ∫₀^(1/2) (L - L²) dL = 4 [ (L²/2 - L³/3) ] from 0 to 1/2\n\nCompute at 1/2:\n\n( (1/2)² / 2 - (1/2)³ / 3 ) = (1/8 - 1/24) = (3/24 - 1/24) = 2/24 = 1/12\n\nMultiply by 4: 4 * 1/12 = 1/3\n\nSo again, we get 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, this seems conflicting with my initial thought that maybe it's 1/6. But according to both methods, fixing the circle and integrating over all possibilities, as well as considering the circular permutations, we get 1/3. So perhaps the answer is 1/3.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we label the four points in the order they appear around the circle as P1, P2, P3, P4. For chords P1P2 and P3P4 to intersect, the points must be interleaved, i.e., the order is P1, P3, P2, P4 or P1, P4, P2, P3. There are two such interleaved orders out of the 4! possible permutations. However, considering rotational symmetry, how does this affect the count?\n\nWait, actually, when considering circular permutations, the number of distinct arrangements where the four points are interleaved is 2. Because once you fix one point, say A, the other three can be arranged in 3! ways. The interleaved arrangements would be A, C, B, D and A, D, B, C. So two out of 6, which is 1/3. So that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider all possible ways to arrange four points on a circle, there are (4 - 1)! = 6 distinct circular permutations. For each permutation, we can check if the chords AB and CD intersect. How many of these permutations result in intersecting chords?\n\nLet's list all 6 permutations (fixing A as the first element):\n\n1. A, B, C, D: AB and CD don't intersect.\n2. A, B, D, C: AB and CD don't intersect.\n3. A, C, B, D: AB and CD intersect.\n4. A, C, D, B: AB and CD intersect.\n5. A, D, B, C: AB and CD intersect.\n6. A, D, C, B: AB and CD don't intersect.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check permutation 4: A, C, D, B. So", "answer": "\\frac{1}{3}"}

So, there are two circles with the same center D. The radii are 1 and 2. The shaded area is supposed to be 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. We need to find the measure of the angle ADC in degrees, which is the smallest one. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the diagram. There's a smaller circle with radius 1 and a larger one with radius 2, both centered at D. The Asymptote code shows points A, C, D. A is on the larger circle, C is also on the larger circle, and D is the center. The angle ADC is formed at the center D by points A and C. So, we need to find how big that angle is, given that the shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the shaded regions are filled gray. The code mentions \"region1\" and \"region2\", but since I can't see the image, I need to infer from the code. Let me parse the code a bit.\n\nThey define a unit circle (radius 1) and a scaled-up circle (radius 2). The angle ADC is drawn with points A, D, C. So, the lines DA and DC are radii of the larger circle. The shaded areas are probably the segments or sectors formed between these radii. Since the problem mentions the total shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area.\n\nThe larger circle has area π*(2)^2 = 4π. So, 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So the shaded area is 5/3 π.\n\nNow, the shaded regions must be sectors or segments of the circles. Since both circles have the same center, the angle ADC is common to both. Let me think.\n\nThe Asymptote code mentions a path region1 which is a curve from a to a/2, then an arc, then c/2 to c, then an outer arc. Region2 is an arc from a/2 to c/2, then a line to d, then another line. Hmm, this is a bit confusing without seeing the image, but maybe I can reconstruct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shaded area is a combination of a sector from the larger circle and a sector from the smaller circle, or maybe a segment. Wait, the problem states two circles with the same center, radii 1 and 2. The angle ADC is the angle at D between points A and C, which are both on the larger circle. So, DA and DC are both radii of the larger circle, each of length 2. The angle between them is what we need to find.\n\nThe shaded area is probably the area between the two circles (the annulus) but limited by the angle ADC. Wait, but if both circles are centered at D, then the area between them is an annulus, which has area π*(2^2 - 1^2) = 3π. However, the problem says the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is 5/12 * 4π = 5π/3. Since 5π/3 is less than 3π (which is 9π/3), so maybe the shaded area is a part of the annulus or a combination of sectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area of the sector formed by angle ADC in the larger circle minus the sector in the smaller circle. Let me think.\n\nIf the angle is θ, then the area of the sector in the larger circle (radius 2) would be (θ/2π)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/2π)*4π = 2θ. Similarly, the area of the sector in the smaller circle (radius 1) would be (θ/2π)*π*(1)^2 = θ/2. So, the shaded area would be 2θ - θ/2 = (3θ)/2. According to the problem, this area is 5π/3. So, (3θ)/2 = 5π/3, solving for θ gives θ = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9. Converting that to degrees, π radians is 180 degrees, so 10π/9 radians is (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees. But the problem asks for the smallest angle ADC, so maybe we need to consider the reflex angle? Wait, but angles around a point are 360 degrees, so 200 degrees is less than 360, so if the angle is 200 degrees, that's already quite large. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the shaded area is not the difference between the two sectors but something else. Let me re-examine the Asymptote code.\n\nThe code defines region1 as (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle. So starting at point a, going to a/2, then following an inner arc (from the smaller circle?), then c/2 to c, then an outer arc (from the larger circle?), forming a closed path. Then region2 is arc from a/2 to c/2, then line to d, then line back. Hmm. Maybe region1 is a sort of lens shape formed by the two arcs, and region2 is a triangle-like shape?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which has area 4π, so 5π/3. Let's see. The larger circle's area is 4π, so 5/12 of that is indeed 5π/3.\n\nIf the shaded area is a combination of a sector from the larger circle and a sector from the smaller circle, but subtracted or added. Wait, maybe it's the area between the two arcs (the inner and outer arcs) over the angle θ. So, the area would be the area of the sector in the larger circle minus the sector in the smaller circle. So, as I thought before: 2θ - (θ/2) = 3θ/2. Then set that equal to 5π/3. Solving for θ gives θ = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9 ≈ 200 degrees. But 10π/9 radians is 200 degrees. However, the problem says \"the smallest\" angle ADC. If the angle is 200 degrees, then the other angle around point D would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees, so the smallest one is 160 degrees. Wait, but 160 degrees is smaller. Wait, but the problem says \"le plus petit\" which is \"the smallest\". So if the angle is 200 degrees, then the smallest angle between DA and DC would be 160 degrees. But 160 degrees is still larger than 180, but wait, no. If the angle is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. But 160 degrees is still more than 180? Wait, no. Wait, angles around a point are measured from 0 to 360. If the angle between DA and DC is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle is 360 - 200 = 160 degrees, right? Wait, no. Wait, 200 degrees is already more than 180, so the smaller angle would be the other way around, which is 160 degrees. So, the smallest angle is 160 degrees. But 160 is less than 200. So, if the angle is 200, the smallest is 160. But the problem says \"Combien de degrés la plus small angle\", so is the answer 160 degrees or 200 degrees?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the shaded area corresponds to 200 degrees or 160 degrees. But according to the calculation, if the angle is 200 degrees, the area would be 3θ/2 = 3*(200 degrees)/2 = 300 degrees. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when dealing with radians, θ has to be in radians. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong because I was mixing degrees and radians.\n\nWait, let's redo this properly. Let's convert everything to radians.\n\nThe area of the sector in the larger circle (radius 2) with angle θ (radians) is (1/2)*r^2*θ = (1/2)*(2)^2*θ = 2θ.\n\nThe area of the sector in the smaller circle (radius 1) with angle θ is (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = θ/2.\n\nSo, the area between them (the annular sector) is 2θ - θ/2 = (3θ)/2.\n\nThe problem states this area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. So, 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.\n\nTherefore, (3θ)/2 = (5/3)π. Solving for θ:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 3θ = (10/3)π\n\nDivide by 3: θ = (10/9)π radians.\n\nConvert θ to degrees: θ = (10/9)*π * (180/π) = (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.\n\nSo, θ is 200 degrees. However, the problem asks for the smallest angle ADC. Since 200 degrees is greater than 180 degrees, the smallest angle between DA and DC would actually be the reflex angle, which is 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. But wait, in terms of the angle at the center, the angle between DA and DC can be measured in two ways: the smaller angle (less than 180 degrees) and the larger angle (more than 180 degrees). But the problem specifies \"the smallest\" angle, so it's 160 degrees.\n\nBut wait, hold on. If the angle is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But is that correct? Let me confirm. If two lines intersect, the angles formed are θ and 360 - θ. So, the smaller one is the minimum of θ and 360 - θ. In this case, θ is 200 degrees, so 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Since 160 < 200, the smallest angle is 160 degrees. But the problem says \"Combien de degrés la plus small angle\", which translates to \"How many degrees is the smallest angle\". So the answer is 160 degrees?\n\nBut wait, the answer choices (if any) are not given. The problem is from a competition, perhaps, and the answer is expected in degrees. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, but maybe the shaded area is not the annular sector. Maybe it's a combination of regions. Let me think again about the Asymptote code.\n\nThe code defines region1 as a path from a to a/2, then an inner arc, then c/2 to c, then an outer arc. So, starting at point a, going to a/2 (midpoint?), then following an inner arc (from the smaller circle?), which connects to c/2, then to c, then following an outer arc (from the larger circle?) back to a. Then region2 is an arc from a/2 to c/2, then a line to d, then a line back. Hmm. Maybe region1 is a sort of curvilinear quadrilateral, and region2 is a triangle-like shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the intersection of two sectors or something else. But since I can't see the diagram, I need to make an educated guess based on the description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the union of two segments. Wait, if the angle is θ, then the area of the sector in the larger circle is (1/2)*r^2*θ, and the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (1/2)*r^2*θ. The shaded area might be the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector. So, as before, (1/2)*(2)^2*θ - (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = 2θ - 0.5θ = 1.5θ. Set equal to 5π/3. Then 1.5θ = 5π/3, so θ = (5π/3)/1.5 = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9 radians, which is 200 degrees. Then the smallest angle is 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. But the problem says \"le plus grand cercle\", which is the larger one, area 4π. The shaded area is 5/12 of that, which is 5π/3. So if θ is 200 degrees, then the area would be 1.5θ = 1.5*(10π/9) = 15π/9 = 5π/3, which matches. So, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smallest angle is 160 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the measure of the smallest angle ADC. So, is it 160 degrees? But the answer is supposed to be in degrees, boxed. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle is drawn as ADC, which is at point D. If the angle is 200 degrees, then the lines DA and DC are almost opposite, but not quite. The smallest angle between them would be 160 degrees. Hmm. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is not an annular sector but something else. For example, if the angle is θ, maybe the shaded area consists of two regions: a segment in the larger circle and a segment in the smaller circle. But I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the shaded area is the area swept by the lines DA and DC, considering both circles. If DA is length 2 and DC is length 1, but they are both radii of different circles. Wait, but the centers are the same, so DA and DC are both from D to A and D to C. If A and C", "answer": "120"}

Now, the spherical reservoir. Let's compute its volume.\n\nV_sph = (4/3)π * (6 cm)³\n= (4/3)π * 216 cm³\n= (4/3) * 216 * π cm³\n= 288π cm³\n\nSo the sphere's volume is 288π cm³. To find out how many beakers we need, we divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one beaker.\n\nNumber of beakers = V_sph / V_cyl\n= (288π cm³) / (72π cm³)\n= 288 / 72\n= 4\n\nWait, so 288 divided by 72 is 4? Let me check that again. 72 times 4 is 288. Yep, that's correct. So, 4 beakers would be needed.\n\nBut hold on, let me verify the calculations once more to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the volume formulas or arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the cylinder: radius 3 cm, height 8 cm. Area of the base is π*(3)^2 = 9π. Multiply by height 8: 9π*8=72π. That seems right.\n\nSphere: radius 6 cm. Volume is (4/3)π*(6)^3. 6 cubed is 216. 4/3 of 216 is (4*216)/3 = (864)/3 = 288. So 288π. Correct.\n\nDivide 288π by 72π: the π cancels out, 288/72=4. Yes, that's 4. So, 4 beakers. Hmm. That seems straightforward. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"combien de telsfoiliers d'eau\". Is there a possibility that there's a language barrier here? The original problem says \"Combien de tels foiliers d'eau\", which translates to \"How many of such beakers of water are needed...\". So, I think the term is \"beakers\" plural, so the answer should be 4 beakers. \n\nIs there any chance I messed up the formulas? Let me confirm. Cylinder volume is definitely πr²h. Sphere is (4/3)πr³. Yes. The numbers: 3 squared is 9, times 8 is 72. Sphere: 6 cubed is 216, times 4/3 is 288. Divided by 72 gives 4. All steps check out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in units? But all units are in centimeters, so no issue there. The answer is 4. So, 4 cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical reservoir. \n\nWait, just to visualize, a sphere with radius 6 cm... How big is that? Let's see, the volume is 288π, which is roughly 904.78 cm³. Each beaker is 72π, which is about 226.19 cm³. 904.78 divided by 226.19 is approximately 4. So, that matches. \n\nAlternatively, if I do 288π / 72π, the π cancels, so 288/72=4. Yep. So even in decimal terms, it's 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning. So, 4 beakers needed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we compare their volumes:\n\n1. **Volume of the cylindrical beaker**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cyl}} = \\pi r_{\\text{cyl}}^2 h_{\\text{cyl}} = \\pi (3\\, \\text{cm})^2 (8\\, \\text{cm}) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the spherical reservoir**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sph}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{\\text{sph}}^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6\\, \\text{cm})^3 = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of beakers required**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_{\\text{sph}}}{V_{\\text{cyl}}} = \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = \\frac{288}{72} = 4\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{4}", "answer": "4"}

Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that arcsin is the inverse function of sine, right? So arcsin 0.4 is the angle whose sine is 0.4, and similarly arcsin 0.5 is the angle whose sine is 0.5. So maybe I can let θ = arcsin 0.4 and φ = arcsin 0.5. Then the expression becomes sin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ). That might simplify things. \n\nBut how do I compute this? Maybe using trigonometric identities? Like the sine addition and subtraction formulas. Let me recall those. \n\nThe sine of a sum is sin(θ + φ) = sinθ cosφ + cosθ sinφ, and the sine of a difference is sin(φ - θ) = sinφ cosθ - cosθ sinφ. So if I multiply these two expressions together, maybe there's a simplification. Let me write that out:\n\nsin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ) = [sinθ cosφ + cosθ sinφ][sinφ cosθ - cosθ sinφ]\n\nHmm, multiplying these two terms... Let's expand the product:\n\nFirst term: sinθ cosφ * sinφ cosθ = sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ\n\nSecond term: sinθ cosφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ\n\nThird term: cosθ sinφ * sinφ cosθ = cosθ cosθ sinφ sinφ\n\nFourth term: cosθ sinφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -cosθ cosθ sinφ sinφ\n\nWait, let's check that expansion again. The first term is sinθ cosφ multiplied by sinφ cosθ, which is sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ. The second term is sinθ cosφ multiplied by (-cosθ sinφ), which is -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. The third term is cosθ sinφ multiplied by sinφ cosθ, which is cosθ sinφ sinφ cosθ. The fourth term is cosθ sinφ multiplied by (-cosθ sinφ), which is -cos²θ sin²φ. \n\nSo combining like terms:\n\nFirst and second terms: sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. Wait, those two terms look similar. Let me factor out sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. Wait, actually, both terms have sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ and -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. Wait, actually, they are the same term but with a negative sign. So sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ = sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ - sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ. Which cancels out? Wait, no, they are the same term. Wait, hold on. Let me write them as:\n\nFirst term: sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ\n\nSecond term: -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ\n\nThird term: cosθ sinφ sinφ cosθ\n\nFourth term: -cos²θ sin²φ\n\nSo, first term and fourth term: sinθ sinφ cosφ cosθ - cos²θ sin²φ\n\nSecond term and third term: -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ + cosθ sin²φ cosθ\n\nWait, maybe I need to group them differently. Let's see:\n\nFirst term: sinθ cosθ sinφ cosφ\n\nSecond term: -sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ\n\nThird term: sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ\n\nFourth term: -cos²θ sin²φ\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: sinθ cosφ * sinφ cosθ = sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ\n\nSecond term: sinθ cosφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ\n\nThird term: cosθ sinφ * sinφ cosθ = cos²θ sin²φ\n\nFourth term: cosθ sinφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -cos²θ sin²φ\n\nWait, so actually, the third and fourth terms are cos²θ sin²φ - cos²θ sin²φ, which cancels out. Then the first and second terms are sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. But these two terms are the same, just written in different order. So sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ = 0. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, first term: sinθ cosφ * sinφ cosθ = sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ\n\nSecond term: sinθ cosφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ\n\nThird term: cosθ sinφ * sinφ cosθ = cosθ sinφ sinφ cosθ = sin²φ cos²θ\n\nFourth term: cosθ sinφ * (-cosθ sinφ) = -cos²θ sin²φ\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term + Fourth term = sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ - sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ + sin²φ cos²θ - cos²θ sin²φ\n\nNow, look at the first two terms. They are both sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ and -sinθ cosθ cosφ sinφ. Which is the same as sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ - sinθ sinφ cosθ cosφ = 0. So those two terms cancel each other out. Then we have the last two terms: sin²φ cos²θ - cos²θ sin²φ = 0. So all terms cancel out? Then the entire product is zero? That seems surprising. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in expanding. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Instead of expanding, maybe use the identity sin A * sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. Let me try that.\n\nLet A = θ + φ and B = φ - θ. Then sin A * sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.\n\nCompute A - B = (θ + φ) - (φ - θ) = θ + φ - φ + θ = 2θ\n\nCompute A + B = (θ + φ) + (φ - θ) = θ + φ + φ - θ = 2φ\n\nSo sin A * sin B = [cos(2θ) - cos(2φ)] / 2\n\nTherefore, the original expression is [cos(2θ) - cos(2φ)] / 2. Let's compute that.\n\nGiven θ = arcsin 0.4 and φ = arcsin 0.5. So cos(2θ) and cos(2φ). Let me recall that cos(2α) = 1 - 2 sin²α. So maybe that's easier to compute.\n\nSo cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ. Since sinθ = 0.4, then cos(2θ) = 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2*0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nSimilarly, cos(2φ) = 1 - 2 sin²φ. Since sinφ = 0.5, then cos(2φ) = 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2*0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, [cos(2θ) - cos(2φ)] / 2 = (0.68 - 0.5)/2 = (0.18)/2 = 0.09\n\nSo the product is 0.09, which is 9/100. So the answer should be 0.09, or 9/100. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me compute sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) and sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) separately and then multiply them. But that might be more complicated.\n\nFirst, compute arcsin 0.4 and arcsin 0.5. Let's call them θ and φ. Then sin(θ + φ) and sin(φ - θ). Then multiply those two sines.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity sin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ) = [sin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ)]. Wait, but we already tried expanding and got zero, but according to the other method, it's 0.09. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps my first approach had a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if we use the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2, then A is θ + φ and B is φ - θ. Then A - B = 2θ and A + B = 2φ. So [cos(2θ) - cos(2φ)] / 2. Then cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ = 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. cos(2φ) = 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 0.5. Then 0.68 - 0.5 = 0.18. Divided by 2 is 0.09. So that's 9/100. So that's 0.09. \n\nBut when I expanded the original expression, I thought all terms canceled out, but maybe that was a mistake. Let me verify the expansion again. Let's take θ and φ as arcsin 0.4 and arcsin 0.5. Then sinθ = 0.4 and sinφ = 0.5. Then cosθ and cosφ can be found using Pythagorean identity.\n\nSince θ = arcsin 0.4, then cosθ = sqrt(1 - 0.4²) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165\n\nSimilarly, φ = arcsin 0.5, so cosφ = sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660\n\nSo let's compute sin(θ + φ) and sin(φ - θ):\n\nFirst, sin(θ + φ) = sinθ cosφ + cosθ sinφ = 0.4 * 0.8660 + 0.9165 * 0.5 ≈ 0.3464 + 0.45825 ≈ 0.80465\n\nThen sin(φ - θ) = sinφ cosθ - cosφ sinθ = 0.5 * 0.9165 - 0.8660 * 0.4 ≈ 0.45825 - 0.3464 ≈ 0.11185\n\nNow multiply these two results: 0.80465 * 0.11185 ≈ Let's compute that.\n\n0.8 * 0.1 = 0.08\n\n0.8 * 0.01185 ≈ 0.00948\n\n0.00465 * 0.1 ≈ 0.000465\n\n0.00465 * 0.01185 ≈ ~0.000055\n\nAdding all together: 0.08 + 0.00948 + 0.000465 + 0.000055 ≈ 0.08999, which is approximately 0.09. So that matches the previous result. So the exact value is 0.09, which is 9/100. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9/100. So boxed, that's \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the expression \\(\\sin (\\arcsin 0.4 + \\arcsin 0.5) \\cdot \\sin (\\arcsin 0.5 - \\arcsin 0.4)\\), we start by letting \\(\\theta = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\phi = \\arcsin 0.5\\).

Quelle est la vitesse du vélo exprimée en pouces par seconde ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the speed from 20 feet per minute to inches per second. Hmm, let me think about how to do this step by step. First, I remember that unit conversion involves changing the units while keeping the value the same. The goal here is to go from feet to inches and from minutes to seconds. \n\nStarting with 20 feet per minute. Let me recall the conversion factors. There are 12 inches in a foot, right? So to convert feet to inches, I would multiply by 12. And for time, since we're going from minutes to seconds, there are 60 seconds in a minute. So maybe I need to divide by 60 to convert minutes to seconds. \n\nLet me write this down:\n\n20 ft/min * (12 in/1 ft) * (1 min/60 sec) \n\nWait, that seems right. Let me verify the units. The feet unit cancels out with the 1 ft in the denominator, leaving inches. Then minutes cancel out with the 1 min in the denominator, leaving seconds. So that would leave me with inches per second. Perfect.\n\nSo calculating the numerical value. 20 times 12 is 240. Then 240 divided by 60 is 4. So 4 inches per second. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion factors. Let me think. \n\nYes, 1 foot is 12 inches, so multiplying by 12 inches/foot. Then 1 minute is 60 seconds, so dividing by 60 seconds/minute. So the calculation is 20 * 12 / 60. \n\n20*12 is indeed 240. 240 divided by 60 is 4. So 4 inches per second. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down into two steps. First convert feet per minute to inches per minute, then convert inches per minute to inches per second. \n\nSo starting with 20 feet per minute. 20 feet/minute * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches per minute. Then, to convert inches per minute to inches per second, divide by 60. 240 /60 = 4 inches per second. Yep, same result. \n\nSo both methods give me 4 inches per second. That seems to check out. \n\nAlternatively, using dimensional analysis. The original unit is ft/min. We need to get to in/sec. So we need to multiply by (12 in/1 ft) to convert feet to inches, and then multiply by (1 min/60 sec) to convert minutes to seconds. \n\nSo 20 ft/min * 12 in/ft * 1 min/60 sec = (20 *12)/60 in/sec = 240/60 = 4 in/sec. \n\nSame answer. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 4 inches per second. Let me just confirm once more with another approach. \n\nSuppose in one minute, the bike travels 20 feet. How many inches is that? 20*12=240 inches. So in one minute, 240 inches. Then, how many seconds are in a minute? 60. So per second, it's 240/60=4 inches. Yep, that's the same. \n\nSo all methods lead to 4 inches per second.

De combien de façons peut-on former un sous-comité de 5 membres qui compte au moins un membre de chaque parti ?", "question": "Un comité du Sénat compte 8 Républicains et 6 Démocrates. De combien de façons peut-on former un sous-comité de 5 membres qui compte au moins un membre de chaque parti ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about forming a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee that has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. The requirement is that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party. So, we need to figure out how many different ways we can form such a subcommittee. \n\nFirst, I remember that when we need to count the number of ways to form a group with certain conditions, sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possible groups without any restrictions and then subtract the ones that don't meet the conditions. In this case, the condition is having at least one member from each party. So, maybe I can calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 (8+6) and then subtract the cases where all 5 are Republicans or all 5 are Democrats. That should give the number of valid subcommittees with at least one from each party. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nTotal number of ways without restrictions is C(14,5). Then, the number of ways where all 5 are Republicans is C(8,5), and all Democrats would be C(6,5). So, subtracting those from the total should give the answer. But wait, let me make sure there's no overlap between the two cases. Since we can't have all 5 being both all Republicans and all Democrats at the same time, there's no overlap, so inclusion-exclusion isn't necessary here. So, the formula would be:\n\nTotal = C(14,5) - C(8,5) - C(6,5)\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify. The total number of possible subcommittees is indeed C(14,5). The ones that don't meet the requirement are those that are all one party, so subtracting the all-integer (either all Republicans or all Democrats) gives the required number. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach it another way. Since the subcommittee must have at least one from each party, the possible distributions are the different ways to split 5 members into two groups (one for each party) with each group having at least one. The possible distributions are:\n\n1 Republican and 4 Democrats\n\n2 Republicans and 3 Democrats\n\n3 Republicans and 2 Democrats\n\n4 Republicans and 1 Democrat\n\nSo, these are the valid combinations. Then, the total number of subcommittees is the sum of each of these cases. Let's compute each one:\n\nFirst case: 1 Republican and 4 Democrats. The number of ways is C(8,1) * C(6,4)\n\nSecond case: 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats. C(8,2) * C(6,3)\n\nThird case: 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. C(8,3) * C(6,2)\n\nFourth case: 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat. C(8,4) * C(6,1)\n\nThen, sum all these up. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: C(8,1) is 8, C(6,4) is 15. So, 8*15=120\n\nSecond term: C(8,2)=28, C(6,3)=20. 28*20=560\n\nThird term: C(8,3)=56, C(6,2)=15. 56*15=840\n\nFourth term: C(8,4)=70, C(6,1)=6. 70*6=420\n\nAdding them up: 120 + 560 = 680; 680 + 840 = 1520; 1520 + 420 = 1940\n\nSo, total is 1940. Let me check what the first method gives. Let's compute C(14,5):\n\nC(14,5) = 14! / (5! * 9!) = (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2*1) = (14*13*12*11*10)/120\n\nCalculate numerator: 14*13=182; 182*12=2184; 2184*11=24024; 24024*10=240240\n\nDivide by 120: 240240 / 120 = 2002\n\nThen, subtract C(8,5) and C(6,5). C(8,5) is 56, C(6,5)=6. So total subtracted is 56+6=62\n\nTherefore, total using first method: 2002 - 62 = 1940\n\nSame result.

{"original_question": "Quelle est la valeur de $513^2 - 487^2$ ?", "question": "Quelle est la valeur de $513^2 - 487^2$ ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the value of 513 squared minus 487 squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember there's a formula for the difference of squares, right? It goes like a squared minus b squared equals (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can use that here instead of calculating each square separately because that might be easier and less error-prone.\n\nLet me write that down: 513² - 487² = (513 - 487)(513 + 487). That sounds right. So now I just need to compute those two differences and sums. Let's start with 513 minus 487. Hmm, 513 minus 487. Let's subtract 400 from 513 first, which gives me 113. Then subtract 87 more. So 113 minus 87. Let me do that step by step. 113 minus 80 is 33, then minus 7 more is 26. So 513 - 487 is 26.\n\nNow for the sum: 513 plus 487. Let's add 500 and 400 first, which is 900. Then add the remaining 13 and 87. 13 + 87 is 100. So 900 + 100 is 1000. Therefore, 513 + 487 equals 1000.\n\nSo now, multiplying those two results together: 26 times 1000. That's straightforward. 26 multiplied by 1000 is 26,000. Therefore, 513² - 487² equals 26,000. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, verifying 513 - 487. Let's do 487 + 26 = 513. Yes, that's correct. 487 plus 20 is 507, then plus 6 is 513. So the subtraction checks out. Then 513 + 487. Let's add them another way. 513 + 487. Breaking it down: 500 + 400 = 900, 13 + 87 = 100. So 900 + 100 = 1000. That's right. So 26 * 1000 is 26,000. Yep, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute each square individually, just to confirm, let's see:\n\n513 squared. Let's compute 500 + 13 squared. Using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So 500² is 250,000. 2ab is 2*500*13 = 100*13 = 1,300. Then b² is 13² = 169. So total is 250,000 + 1,300 + 169 = 250,000 + 1,300 is 251,300, plus 169 is 251,469. So 513² is 251,469.\n\nNow 487 squared. Let's do the same approach. 487 is 500 - 13. So (500 - 13)² = 500² - 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 - 13,000 + 169. So 250,000 minus 13,000 is 237,000. Then plus 169 is 237,169. So 487² is 237,169.\n\nSubtracting them: 251,469 - 237,169. Let's subtract. 251,469 minus 200,000 is 51,469. Then minus 37,000 more would be 51,469 - 37,000 = 14,469. Then subtract the remaining 169: 14,469 - 169 = 14,300. Wait, that's 14,300. But according to the difference of squares, it should be 26,000. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the individual squares.\n\nFirst, 513 squared. Let me compute 513*513. Let's do it step by step. 500*500 = 250,000. Then 500*13 = 6,500, and 13*500 = 6,500, so total for cross terms is 13,000. Then 13*13=169. So total is 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 263,169. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, (a + b)² is a² + 2ab + b². So for 513, which is 500 + 13, so a=500, b=13. So a²=250,000, 2ab=2*500*13=13,000, and b²=169. So adding them up: 250,000 + 13,000 = 263,000 + 169 = 263,169. So 513² is 263,169.\n\nWait, earlier I thought I did that as 251,469, but that was wrong. Let me check again. Maybe I confused the numbers. Let me multiply 513 by 513 properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking it down differently. 513*500 = 256,500. Then 513*13. Let's compute 513*10=5,130, 513*3=1,539. So 5,130 + 1,539 = 6,669. So total is 256,500 + 6,669 = 263,169. Yes, that's correct. So 513 squared is indeed 263,169.\n\nNow 487 squared. Let's compute that. 487*487. Let's do the same approach. 400 + 87. So (400 + 87)² = 400² + 2*400*87 + 87². 400² is 160,000. 2*400*87 is 800*87. Let's compute 800*80=64,000 and 800*7=5,600. So 64,000 + 5,600 = 69,600. Then 87² is 7,569. So total is 160,000 + 69,600 = 229,600 + 7,569 = 237,169. So that's correct. So 487 squared is 237,169.\n\nNow subtract: 263,169 - 237,169. Let's subtract. 263,169 minus 237,169. The 263,169 minus 200,000 is 63,169. Then subtract 37,000: 63,169 - 37,000 = 26,169. Then subtract the remaining 169: 26,169 - 169 = 26,000. There we go. So that matches the difference of squares method. So my initial calculation when I thought I got 14,300 was wrong because I messed up the 513 squared. So the correct result is indeed 26,000.\n\nSo the difference of squares formula worked perfectly here, and when I first thought I messed up, it was because of an arithmetic error in calculating 513 squared. So it's important to double-check your work when doing it manually, especially with large numbers. But the difference of squares method simplifies the problem a lot, avoiding the tediousness of squaring each number individually. Therefore, the answer is 26,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\boxed{26000}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\), we can use the difference of squares formula, which states \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\):\n\\[\na - b = 513 - 487 = 26\n\\]\n\\[\na + b = 513 + 487 = 1000\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply these results together:\n\\[\n(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \\times 1000 = 26000\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can also compute each square individually:\n\\[\n513^2 = 263169\n\\]\n\\[\n487^2 = 237169\n\\]\n\\[\n513^2 - 487^2 = 263169 - 237169 = 26000\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{26000}\\).", "answer": "26000"}

Quel est le plus grand des trois entiers consécutifs ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the product of three consecutive integers is 120. When this product is divided by the average of the three integers, the result is 24. We need to find the largest of these three integers. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the three consecutive integers. Since they are consecutive, if I let the middle one be x, then the other two would be x-1 and x+1. That makes sense because consecutive integers differ by 1. So, the three numbers are x-1, x, and x+1.\n\nNow, the product of these three numbers is given as 120. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n(x - 1) * x * (x + 1) = 120\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(x - 1) * x * (x + 1) = 120\n\nI can also note that multiplying three consecutive numbers is like multiplying three numbers in a row, so maybe there's a pattern here. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe second part of the problem says that when the product is divided by the average of the three integers, the result is 24. Let's parse that. The average of the three integers is ( (x - 1) + x + (x + 1) ) / 3. Let's compute that.\n\nAdding them up: (x - 1) + x + (x + 1) = x - 1 + x + x + 1. The -1 and +1 cancel out, so that's 3x. Therefore, the average is 3x / 3 = x. Oh, interesting! The average of three consecutive integers is just the middle one, which is x. That simplifies things.\n\nSo, the product divided by the average is 24. The product is 120, so:\n\n120 / x = 24\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\nx = 120 / 24 = 5\n\nSo, x is 5. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. The largest of these is 6. Wait, but let me verify that this is correct because sometimes these problems can be tricky.\n\nFirst, check if the product is 120. 4 * 5 * 6 = 120. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, check the average. The average of 4, 5, 6 is (4 + 5 + 6)/3 = 15/3 = 5. Then, 120 divided by 5 is 24, which matches the problem statement. So, everything checks out.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't other possible solutions. Sometimes, when dealing with integers, there might be negative numbers involved. Let me consider if x could be negative.\n\nSuppose x is negative. Let's say x = -5. Then the three numbers would be -6, -5, -4. Their product is (-6)*(-5)*(-4). Let's calculate that: (-6)*(-5) = 30, then 30*(-4) = -120. The product is -120, which doesn't match the given product of 120. So, that's not valid.\n\nWhat if x is a different negative number? Let's try x = -1. Then the numbers are -2, -1, 0. Their product is (-2)*(-1)*0 = 0, which is not 120. So, that's out.\n\nHow about x = 0? Then the numbers are -1, 0, 1. Product is 0. Not 120.\n\nx = 1: numbers 0,1,2. Product 0. x=2: numbers 1,2,3. Product 6. x=3: 2,3,4. 24. x=4: 3,4,5. 60. x=5: 4,5,6. 120. So, as we can see, when x=5, the product is 120. So, positive numbers only here. If we tried x=10, the product would be way larger, like 9*10*11=990, which is way bigger than 120. So, x=5 is the only positive integer that works here.\n\nTherefore, the three numbers must be 4,5,6, with the largest being 6.\n\nBut let me just check if there's another way this could be approached, maybe without assuming the middle number is x. Let's say instead, let the three consecutive integers be n, n+1, n+2. Then, the product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 120. The average is (n + n+1 + n+2)/3 = (3n + 3)/3 = n + 1. Then, the product divided by the average is n(n+1)(n+2)/(n+1) = n(n+2). So, according to the problem, n(n+2) = 24.\n\nSo, n(n+2) = 24. Let's solve this equation.\n\nn² + 2n - 24 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nn = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(100)] / 2 = [-2 ± 10]/2\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nn = (-2 + 10)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nn = (-2 -10)/2 = -12/2 = -6\n\nSo, n = 4 or n = -6. Then, the three numbers would be:\n\nIf n = 4: 4,5,6\n\nIf n = -6: -6, -5, -4\n\nNow, check the product for n = -6: (-6)*(-5)*(-4) = (-6)*(-5) = 30, 30*(-4) = -120. Not 120. So, that's invalid. Therefore, only n=4 is valid. So, the numbers are 4,5,6. So, largest is 6. That's the same answer as before.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how we approach it, the largest integer is 6. So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut just to ensure there are no other possible solutions, let's check if n(n+2) =24 has other integer solutions. For n=4: 4*6=24. For n=-6: -6*(-4)=24. Wait, that's 24. Wait, but in the case of n=-6, the product is -120, not 120, so even though n(n+2)=24, the product is negative. So, even though the equation n(n+2)=24 has two solutions, only n=4 gives a valid product of 120. The other solution gives a product of -120, which is not equal to 120, so it's invalid. Therefore, only n=4 is the solution.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer is 6.\n\nI think that's thorough. So, the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest of the three consecutive integers is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be \\( x-1 \\), \\( x \\), and \\( x+1 \\).

Hmm, let me start by recalling how to handle cube roots. Since the cube root of something equals 16, I can cube both sides to get rid of the cube root, right? That should make the equation easier to solve. Let me write that down.\n\nThe original equation is:\n∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nIf I cube both sides, that becomes:\n(∛(x² - 4x + 4))³ = 16³\n\nSimplifying the left side, the cube and the cube root cancel each other out, so I have:\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16³\n\nNow, let me compute 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... wait, 256*10 is 2560, 256*6 is 1536, so adding those gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16³ is 4096. So now the equation is:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nHmm, okay. Now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set it to zero:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nx = [-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-4092))] / (2*1)\nx = [4 ± √(16 - 4*(-4092))] / 2\nx = [4 ± √(16 + 16368)] / 2\nWait, because the discriminant is 16 - 4*1*(-4092). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the discriminant inside the square root:\n\nb² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*1*(-4092) = 16 - (-16368) = 16 + 16368 = 16384\n\nOh, 16384 is a perfect square. What's the square root of 16384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128: 100*100=10,000, 28*28=784, and cross terms 2*100*28=5600, so total 10,000 + 5600 + 784 = 16,384. So √16384 = 128.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\nx = [4 ± 128] / 2\n\nSo that gives two solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x. So between 66 and -62, the positive one is 66. So x = 66.\n\nWait, but let me check if these solutions actually satisfy the original equation, because sometimes when we cube both sides, we might introduce extraneous solutions. Let me verify x = 66 first.\n\nCompute x² - 4x + 4 when x = 66:\n\n66² is 4356, minus 4*66 is 264, so 4356 - 264 = 4092, then add 4: 4092 + 4 = 4096\n\nSo the cube root of 4096 is 16, since 16³ = 4096. So that works.\n\nNow check x = -62:\n\n(-62)² is 3844, minus 4*(-62) is +248, so 3844 + 248 = 4092, add 4 gives 4096 again. So cube root of 4096 is 16. So that also works.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes products of cosines can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Maybe I can use the product-to-sum formulas? But with four terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall there are some product identities for multiple angles or something related to roots of unity.

Let me check.\n\nLooking at the angles: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. But 16π/15 is more than π, so cos(16π/15) is the same as cos(π + π/15) which is -cos(π/15). Similarly, maybe other terms can be expressed as negative angles or in terms of smaller angles?\n\nWait, cos(16π/15) is equal to cos(π + π/15) which is -cos(π/15). Let me confirm that. The cosine of π + x is -cos(x), so yes, cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). So that term is -cos(π/15). So maybe I can rewrite the entire product as cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * (-cos(π/15)).\n\nSo that product becomes -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Hmm. That might be easier to handle.\n\nNow, I remember that products of cosines with angles doubling each time can sometimes be simplified using a formula. For example, the product from k=0 to n-1 of cos(θ * 2^k) can be expressed in terms of sin(θ) or something. Let me recall that formula.\n\nYes, there's a formula for the product of cosines with angles in a geometric progression where each term is double the previous one. The formula is something like:\n\nProduct from k=0 to n-1 of cos(θ * 2^k) = (sin(2^n θ)) / (2^n sinθ)\n\nIs that right? Let me check for a small n. Let's take n=1: product is cosθ. The formula would give sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ). But sin(2θ)/2 sinθ = (2 sinθ cosθ)/2 sinθ = cosθ. So yes, that works. For n=2: product is cosθ * cos(2θ). The formula gives sin(4θ)/(4 sinθ). Let's check:\n\ncosθ * cos2θ = [sin4θ]/[4 sinθ]. Let's compute RHS: sin4θ/(4 sinθ). Let's compute LHS:\n\ncosθ * cos2θ = [cosθ * cos2θ] = [ (cos3θ + cosθ)/2 ] by the product-to-sum formula. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Wait, let me compute for specific θ. Let θ = π/4. Then cos(π/4)*cos(π/2) = (√2/2)*0 = 0. Formula: sin(4*(π/4))/ (4 sin(π/4)) = sin(π)/(4*(√2/2)) = 0/(2√2) = 0. So matches. So maybe the formula works. So perhaps for n=4, the product cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * cos(8θ) = sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). Let me check θ=π/16. Then the product would be cos(π/16)cos(π/8)cos(π/4)cos(π/2). But cos(π/2)=0, so product is 0. Formula: sin(16*(π/16))/16 sin(π/16) = sin(π)/16 sin(π/16) = 0, which matches. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this formula, if we set θ = π/15, then the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)). But 16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, substituting back, the product becomes (-sin(π/15))/(16 sin(π/15)) = -1/16.\n\nSo the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, going back to our original problem, the product we need is -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = -(-1/16) = 1/16. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me retrace. Our original product was:\n\ncos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15).\n\nWe noticed that cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So the product is equal to -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Then, we applied the formula and found that the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, substituting back, the original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16. So the answer is 1/16.\n\nBut let me verify that again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). Correct.\n\nSo original product: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * (-cos(π/15)) = -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). So yes, the product inside is the same as the formula, which gives -1/16. Therefore, the entire original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16.\n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. The formula says that the product from k=0 to n-1 of cos(θ * 2^k) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). In our case, θ = π/15, and n=4 terms: cos(π/15), cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15). So n=4. Then the product should be sin(2^4 * π/15)/(2^4 sin(π/15)) = sin(16π/15)/16 sin(π/15). But 16π/15 is π + π/15, so sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, sin(16π/15)/16 sin(π/15) = (-sin(π/15))/16 sin(π/15) = -1/16. So the product is indeed -1/16. Therefore, our original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/16. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can test with a specific value. Let's compute each term numerically and multiply them to see if we get approximately 1/16.\n\nFirst, convert the angles to degrees for easier understanding. 2π/15 is 24 degrees, 4π/15 is 48 degrees, 8π/15 is 96 degrees, and 16π/15 is 192 degrees.\n\nCompute each cosine:\n\ncos(24°): approximately 0.9135\n\ncos(48°): approximately 0.6691\n\ncos(96°): approximately -0.1045\n\ncos(192°): cos(180° + 12°) = -cos(12°) ≈ -0.9781\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\n0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6128\n\n0.6128 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0638\n\n-0.0638 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0624\n\nNow, 1/16 is 0.0625. So the numerical approximation is about 0.0624, which is very close to 1/16 (0.0625). So that checks out. Therefore, the answer is indeed 1/16.\n\nTherefore, after simplifying using trigonometric identities and verifying numerically, the product simplifies to 1/16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16}}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the product \\(\\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{15} \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi}{15} \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi}{15} \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac{16 \\pi}{15} \\right)\\), we start by noting that \\(\\cos \\left( \\frac{16 \\pi}{15} \\right) = \\cos \\left( \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{15} \\right) = -\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{15} \\right)\\).

So, we have an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC and an altitude AM = 11. There's a point D on AM such that AD = 10, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude AM is also the median and the angle bisector. That means M is the midpoint of BC. The coordinates in the Asymptote code suggest that A is at (0,11), M is the midpoint of B and C, which are at (-5.5,0) and (5.5,0) respectively. But wait, the Asymptote code mentions B is at (-11/2,0) which is -5.5, and C at (11/2,0) which is 5.5. So BC has length 11, and AM is 11. So if that's the case, the base BC is 11 and the altitude is 11, making ABC an isosceles triangle with sides AB = AC. Then the legs AB and AC can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: each is sqrt((11/2)^2 + 11^2). Wait, but that's if BC is 11. However, the problem might not specify BC's length yet. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, they place B at (-11/2,0) and C at (11/2,0), so BC is 11 units long, and AM is 11 units. So in that case, the triangle ABC would have base BC = 11 and altitude AM = 11. Then AB and AC would each be sqrt((11/2)^2 + 11^2) = sqrt( (121/4) + 121 ) = sqrt( (121/4) + (484/4) ) = sqrt(605/4) = (√605)/2. But that seems a bit complicated. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just an illustration, not to scale? Because the problem says \"Supposons qu'il y a un point D sur AM avec AD=10\", so AD is 10, which is 11 - AD = 1, so DM = 1. So point D is 10 units from A and 1 unit from M.\n\nBut maybe I need to approach this algebraically. Let me denote the triangle ABC with AB = AC, altitude AM = 11, so M is the midpoint of BC. Let's let BC = 2x, so BM = MC = x. Then, since AM is the altitude, AB = AC = sqrt(x^2 + 11^2). So the sides AB and AC are each sqrt(x^2 + 121). The perimeter would then be 2*sqrt(x^2 + 121) + 2x.\n\nNow, there's a point D on AM such that AD = 10. Since AM = 11, then DM = 1. So D is 10 units up from A towards M, or 1 unit below M. Wait, AM is the altitude from A to BC, so starting at A (0,11) in the Asymptote code, going down to M (0,0). So if AD = 10, then D is at (0,1), since A is (0,11) and moving down 10 units would be at (0,1). Then DM is 1 unit, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, angle BDC is 3 times angle BAC. Let's denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. We need to relate these angles somehow. Maybe using trigonometry or coordinate geometry?\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0), B at (-x,0), C at (x,0), so that BC is 2x, and M is the midpoint. Then point D is at (0,1) as established.\n\nNow, angle BAC is θ. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angle BAC is the vertex angle, and angles at B and C are equal. The coordinates of B, C, D are (-x,0), (x,0), (0,1). So we need to compute angle BDC, which is the angle at D between points B, D, and C.\n\nTo find angle BDC, we can compute vectors DB and DC and use the dot product formula. Let's compute vectors DB and DC. Point D is (0,1). Point B is (-x,0), so vector DB is (-x - 0, 0 - 1) = (-x, -1). Similarly, vector DC is (x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1). The angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC.\n\nThe dot product of DB and DC is (-x)(x) + (-1)(-1) = -x² + 1. The magnitude of DB is sqrt(x² + 1), and the magnitude of DC is sqrt(x² + 1). So the cosine of angle BDC is ( -x² + 1 ) / ( sqrt(x² + 1) * sqrt(x² + 1) ) ) = (1 - x²) / (x² + 1).\n\nSo angle BDC has cosine equal to (1 - x²)/(1 + x²). Now, angle BAC is θ. In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ, and since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. The length of AB is sqrt(x² + 121), as we established earlier. The angle θ can be found using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC: cosθ = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC). But since AB = AC, this simplifies to (2AB² - BC²)/(2AB²). Since AB² = x² + 121 and BC = 2x, so BC² = 4x². Therefore, cosθ = (2(x² + 121) - 4x²)/(2(x² + 121)) ) = (2x² + 242 - 4x²)/(2x² + 242) ) = (-2x² + 242)/(2x² + 242) ) = ( -x² + 121 ) / (x² + 121 ).\n\nSo cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). But we also have that angle BDC = 3θ, and we found that cos(angle BDC) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²). Therefore, using the cosine of 3θ:\n\ncos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²).\n\nBut we also have cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). So we can use the triple angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ.\n\nTherefore, setting this equal to (1 - x²)/(1 + x²):\n\n4cos³θ - 3cosθ = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)\n\nSubstituting cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²):\n\n4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)] = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can let y = x² to simplify the equation. Let y = x². Then:\n\n4[(121 - y)/(121 + y)]³ - 3[(121 - y)/(121 + y)] = (1 - y)/(1 + y)\n\nLet me denote z = (121 - y)/(121 + y). Then the equation becomes:\n\n4z³ - 3z = (1 - y)/(1 + y)\n\nBut we need to express (1 - y)/(1 + y) in terms of z. Let's solve for y in terms of z:\n\nz = (121 - y)/(121 + y)\n\nMultiply both sides by (121 + y):\n\nz(121 + y) = 121 - y\n\n121z + zy = 121 - y\n\nBring terms with y to one side:\n\nzy + y = 121 - 121z\n\ny(z + 1) = 121(1 - z)\n\nTherefore, y = [121(1 - z)] / (z + 1)\n\nNow, substitute back into (1 - y)/(1 + y):\n\n(1 - y)/(1 + y) = [1 - y]/[1 + y] = [1 - (121(1 - z)/(z + 1))]/[1 + (121(1 - z)/(z + 1))]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: [ (z + 1) - 121(1 - z) ] / (z + 1 )\n\nDenominator: [ (z + 1) + 121(1 - z) ] / (z + 1 )\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ (z + 1 - 121 + 121z ) ] / [ (z + 1 + 121 - 121z ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: z + 1 - 121 + 121z = (z + 121z) + (1 - 121) = 122z - 120\n\nDenominator: z + 1 + 121 - 121z = (z - 121z) + (1 + 121) = -120z + 122\n\nSo (1 - y)/(1 + y) = (122z - 120)/(-120z + 122) = [122(z - 1)] / [ -120(z - 1) + 4 ] Hmm, wait, maybe factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 122(z - 1) + 4\n\nWait, 122z - 120 = 122z - 122 + 2 = 122(z - 1) + 2\n\nDenominator: -120z + 122 = -120(z - 1) - 2\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, factor 2:\n\nNumerator: 122(z - 1) + 4\n\nDenominator: -120(z - 1) + 4\n\nWait, maybe not helpful. Let's just proceed.\n\nSo (1 - y)/(1 + y) = (122z - 120)/(-120z + 122) = [2(61z - 60)] / [ -2(60z - 61) ] = [61z - 60]/[-60z + 61] = -(61z - 60)/(60z - 61)\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe instead of substituting z, let's work directly with the equation:\n\n4z³ - 3z = (1 - y)/(1 + y)\n\nBut we have y = [121(1 - z)]/(1 + z)\n\nSo substitute y into the right-hand side:\n\n(1 - [121(1 - z)/(1 + z)]) / (1 + [121(1 - z)/(1 + z)])\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator:\n\n1 - [121(1 - z)/(1 + z)] = [ (1 + z) - 121(1 - z) ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [1 + z - 121 + 121z ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [ (1 - 121) + (z + 121z) ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [ -120 + 122z ] / (1 + z )\n\nDenominator:\n\n1 + [121(1 - z)/(1 + z)] = [ (1 + z) + 121(1 - z) ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [1 + z + 121 - 121z ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [ (1 + 121) + (z - 121z) ] / (1 + z )\n\n= [122 - 120z ] / (1 + z )\n\nTherefore, (1 - y)/(1 + y) = [ -120 + 122z ] / [122 - 120z ]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n4z³ - 3z = (122z - 120)/(122 - 120z )\n\nMultiply both sides by (122 - 120z ) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n(4z³ - 3z)(122 - 120z ) = 122z - 120\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:\n\nFirst, expand 4z³ * (122 - 120z ) = 488z³ - 480z^4\n\nThen, -3z * (122 - 120z ) = -366z + 360z²\n\nSo overall, left-hand side is:\n\n-480z^4 + 488z³ + 360z² - 366z\n\nSet equal to right-hand side:\n\n-480z^4 + 488z³ + 360z² - 366z = 122z - 120\n\nBring all terms to the left-hand side:\n\n-480z^4 + 488z³ + 360z² - 366z - 122z + 120 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-480z^4 + 488z³ + 360z² - 488z + 120 = 0\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n-480z^4 + 488z³", "answer": "11 \\sqrt{5} + 11"}

Quelle est leur médiane ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers that add up to 3^7. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that there are 27 consecutive positive integers. Their sum is equal to 3 to the power of 7. I need to find the median of this set of numbers. \n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, they form an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 1. In such a sequence, the median is equal to the average of the first and last term because the terms are evenly spaced. But since there are 27 terms, which is an odd number, the median will actually be the 14th term (since (27+1)/2 = 14). So the median is the middle number, right?\n\nBut let me confirm that. For an odd number of terms, the median is the term at position (n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. So here, n is 27, so (27+1)/2 = 14. So yes, the 14th term is the median. Alternatively, since the numbers are consecutive, the median should be equal to the average of the sequence. So maybe I can find the average first and that would be the median. Since the sum is 3^7, the average would be 3^7 divided by 27. Let me check that.\n\nWait, 27 is 3^3, so 3^7 divided by 3^3 is 3^(7-3) = 3^4 = 81. So the average is 81. Therefore, the median is 81. Is that right? Let me verify.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, let me think again. If the numbers are consecutive integers, the median is indeed equal to the average. Because in an arithmetic sequence, the average is equal to the median. So if I compute the sum as 27 times the average, then the average is 3^7 / 27 = 3^4 = 81. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the median is 81.\n\nBut maybe I need to approach it more directly. Let's suppose that the first term is a. Then the 27 consecutive numbers are a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+26. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = n/2 * (first term + last term). So here, n = 27, first term = a, last term = a + 26. Therefore, the sum S = 27/2 * (a + (a + 26)) = 27/2 * (2a + 26) = 27*(a + 13). \n\nAccording to the problem, this sum is equal to 3^7. So 27*(a + 13) = 3^7. Let's compute 3^7: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187. Therefore, 27*(a + 13) = 2187. \n\nDivide both sides by 27: a + 13 = 2187 / 27. Let's compute that: 2187 divided by 27. 27*80=2160, so 2187 - 2160 = 27. Therefore, 2187 /27 = 81. So a +13 =81. Therefore, a=81 -13=68. \n\nSo the first term is 68. Therefore, the sequence is from 68 to 68+26=94. The median is the middle term, which is the 14th term. Let's compute that. The first term is 68, so the 14th term is 68 +13=81. Wait, 68 +13 is 81? Wait, 68 +13=81? 68 +10=78, plus 3=81. Yes, correct. So the 14th term is 81. Therefore, the median is 81. \n\nAlternatively, since the average is 81, and in an arithmetic sequence the median equals the average, that's another way to see it. So either way, the median is 81. Therefore, the answer should be 81. \n\nBut let me check once again. Let's compute the sum of numbers from 68 to 94. The number of terms is 94 -68 +1=27. Correct. The sum is (68 +94)*27/2= (162)*27/2=81*27=2187. Which is 3^7. So that's correct. Therefore, the median is indeed 81. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 81. So I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe median is \\boxed{81}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem of finding the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \\(3^7\\), we start by noting that the median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle term. \n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the integers:\n\\[\n3^7 = 2187\n\\]\n\nSince the sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n\\]\nwhere \\(n = 27\\), we have:\n\\[\n2187 = \\frac{27}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n2187 = 27 \\times (\\text{average})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{average} = \\frac{2187}{27} = 81\n\\]\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence of consecutive integers, the median is equal to the average. Therefore, the median of the sequence is 81. \n\nTo verify, we consider the first term \\(a\\) and the last term \\(a + 26\\). The sum of the sequence is:\n\\[\n27 \\times (a + 13) = 2187\n\\]\nSolving for \\(a\\):\n\\[\na + 13 = \\frac{2187}{27} = 81\n\\]\n\\[\na = 81 - 13 = 68\n\\]\n\nThe sequence starts at 68 and ends at 94, with the 14th term (the median) being:\n\\[\n68 + 13 = 81\n\\]\n\nThus, the median is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).", "answer": "81"}

Exprimez votre réponse en notation d'intervalle.", "response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out for which real values of x the inequality -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21 is satisfied. Hmm, okay. So, this is a compound inequality, meaning both parts need to be true: first, x⁴ + 4x² has to be greater than -4, and second, it has to be less than 21. Let me tackle each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.\n\nStarting with the left part: x⁴ + 4x² > -4. Let me see. Since x⁴ is always non-negative (because any real number to the fourth power is non-negative) and 4x² is also non-negative (since x² is non-negative), their sum is going to be non-negative. So x⁴ + 4x² is always ≥ 0. The question is, when is this sum greater than -4? But since it's always at least 0, which is already greater than -4, this inequality holds for all real x. So, the left part doesn't restrict the values of x at all. That simplifies things.\n\nNow, moving on to the right part: x⁴ + 4x² < 21. This seems trickier. Let me consider substituting y = x². Since x is a real number, y will be non-negative (y ≥ 0). Then the inequality becomes y² + 4y < 21. Let's write that as y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Now, solving this quadratic inequality. First, find the roots of the equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)] / 2 = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2. So the roots are (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and (-4 -10)/2 = -14/2 = -7. So the quadratic factors as (y - 3)(y + 7) = 0. But since y ≥ 0, the root at y = -7 is irrelevant. So, the critical points are y = 3. \n\nNow, since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of y² is positive), the inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0 is satisfied between the roots. But since one root is at y = -7 (which is not in the domain) and the other is at y = 3, the inequality holds for y in (-7, 3). But since y ≥ 0, the valid interval is [0, 3). Therefore, y must be between 0 and 3. Translating back to x, since y = x², we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. \n\nSolving for x: x² < 3 implies that |x| < √3. So, x is in (-√3, √3). Also, x² ≥ 0 is always true, so the combined solution here is x ∈ (-√3, √3).\n\nBut wait, we have to remember that the original inequality is x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Let me verify if this substitution is correct. Let me take x = √3. Then x⁴ = (√3)^4 = 9, and 4x² = 4*(3) = 12. So x⁴ + 4x² = 9 + 12 = 21. So at x = √3, the expression equals 21, which is not less than 21. Therefore, x must be strictly less than √3 in absolute value. So, x ∈ (-√3, √3). That makes sense.\n\nBut let me check another point. Let's take x = 0. Then 0 + 0 = 0 < 21. Good. Take x = 1: 1 + 4 = 5 < 21. Good. Take x = 2: 16 + 16 = 32, which is greater than 21. So, 2 is outside the interval. So, between √3 and 2, the expression exceeds 21. Therefore, the upper bound is indeed √3.\n\nSo, combining both parts of the original inequality: the left part is always true, and the right part restricts x to (-√3, √3). Therefore, the solution is x ∈ (-√3, √3).\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, let me take x = -√3. Then x² = (√3)^2 = 3, so x⁴ = 9. So x⁴ +4x² = 9 + 12 = 21. So again, at x = -√3, the expression equals 21, which is not less than 21. So x must be strictly between -√3 and √3.\n\nIs there a possibility that the left inequality x⁴ +4x² > -4 could restrict x further? But since x⁴ and 4x² are both non-negative, their sum is at least 0, which is greater than -4. So, no, the left inequality doesn't impose any additional restrictions. Therefore, the entire solution set is just from the right inequality.\n\nSo, the final answer should be all real numbers x such that |x| < √3. In interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).\n\nBut to make sure, let me test a value inside the interval and outside. Let's take x = 1.5. Then x² = 2.25, x⁴ = 5.0625. So 5.0625 + 4*(2.25) = 5.0625 + 9 = 14.0625 < 21. That works. Take x = 1.9: x² ≈ 3.61, x⁴ ≈ 13.0321. Then 13.0321 + 4*3.61 ≈ 13.0321 + 14.44 ≈ 27.4721, which is greater than 21. So, 1.9 is outside the interval. Wait, but 1.9 is approximately 1.9, which is greater than √3 ≈ 1.732. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me compute √3 more precisely. √3 is approximately 1.732. So, x = 1.8 would be 1.8² = 3.24, x⁴ = (3.24)² ≈ 10.4976. Then 10.4976 + 4*3.24 ≈ 10.4976 + 12.96 ≈ 23.4576, which is still greater than 21. So, x = 1.8 is outside the interval. Let's find x where x⁴ +4x² =21. Let me solve it numerically. Let me set y =x². So y² +4y =21. y² +4y -21=0. The solution is y = [-4 ±√(16 +84)]/2 = [-4 ±√100]/2 = [-4 ±10]/2. So positive solution is (6)/2=3. So y=3. Therefore, x²=3, so x=±√3≈±1.732. So, indeed, x must be between -√3 and √3. \n\nTherefore, the solution is x ∈ (-√3, √3). So, the answer is \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the inequality are \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \\), we analyze each part of the compound inequality separately.\n\n1. **Left part of the inequality: \\( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \\)**\n   - Since \\( x^4 \\) and \\( 4x^2 \\) are both non-negative for all real \\( x \\), their sum \\( x^4 + 4x^2 \\) is always non-negative.

I have three variables x, y, z with three equations. I need to find the value of xy + yz + zx. Hmm, the equations given are:\n\n1. xyz = 4,\n2. x³ + y³ + z³ = 4,\n3. xy² + x² y + xz² + x² z + yz² + y² z = 12.\n\nI remember that when dealing with symmetric equations involving sums of variables, products, and powers, sometimes it's useful to use symmetric sums or Newton's identities. Let me recall some formulas.\n\nFirst, let's denote S1 = x + y + z, S2 = xy + yz + zx, and S3 = xyz. These are the elementary symmetric sums. We know S3 from the first equation: S3 = 4.\n\nWe also have the equation x³ + y³ + z³ = 4. There's a formula that relates x³ + y³ + z³ to S1, S2, and S3. Let me recall that formula. \n\nYes, x³ + y³ + z³ = (x + y + z)³ - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz. So, substituting the known values:\n\n4 = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 3*4.\n\nHmm, that gives me an equation involving S1 and S2. But we have another equation as well. Let me see the third equation: xy² + x² y + xz² + x² z + yz² + y² z = 12.\n\nThis expression is a bit more complicated. Let me try to factor or rewrite it. Let's look at the terms:\n\nxy² + x² y can be factored as xy(x + y), right? Similarly, xz² + x² z = xz(x + z), and yz² + y² z = yz(y + z). So the entire expression is:\n\nxy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z).\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz. Wait, let me check that.\n\nExpanding (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx):\n\n= x(xy) + x(yz) + x(zx) + y(xy) + y(yz) + y(zx) + z(xy) + z(yz) + z(zx)\n\n= x²y + xyz + x²z + xy² + y²z + yzx + zxy + yz² + z²x\n\n= x²y + x²z + xy² + y²z + xz² + yz² + 3xyz.\n\nSo, (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x²y + x²z + xy² + y²z + xz² + yz² + 3xyz.\n\nBut our third equation is x²y + xy² + x²z + yz² + xz² + y²z = 12. Comparing this to the expansion above, the left side of our third equation is equal to (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz. Because the expansion includes the 3xyz term, which is not included in the third equation. Therefore:\n\nThird equation: (S1)(S2) - 3S3 = 12.\n\nWe know S3 = 4, so substituting:\n\nS1*S2 - 3*4 = 12 ⇒ S1*S2 - 12 = 12 ⇒ S1*S2 = 24 ⇒ S1*S2 = 24. So that's another equation involving S1 and S2.\n\nEarlier, from the second equation, we had:\n\n4 = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 12.\n\nBecause substituting into x³ + y³ + z³:\n\nx³ + y³ + z³ = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 3*S3 = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 12 = 4.\n\nSo that equation becomes S1³ - 3S1*S2 = 4 - 12 = -8. Therefore:\n\nS1³ - 3S1*S2 = -8.\n\nBut we already have S1*S2 = 24. Let me denote S1 = a and S2 = b. Then we have:\n\nFrom the third equation: a*b = 24.\n\nFrom the second equation: a³ - 3a*b = -8.\n\nSubstituting b = 24/a into the second equation:\n\na³ - 3a*(24/a) = -8 ⇒ a³ - 72 = -8 ⇒ a³ = 64 ⇒ a = 4.\n\nSo, S1 = a = 4. Then, since a*b = 24, we have 4*b = 24 ⇒ b = 6. Therefore, S2 = 6.\n\nBut S2 is exactly the value we need to find, which is xy + yz + zx. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, let me verify this step by step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, let's recap:\n\nGiven:\n\n1. xyz = 4 ⇒ S3 = 4.\n2. x³ + y³ + z³ = 4.\n3. xy² + x² y + xz² + x² z + yz² + y² z = 12.\n\nWe used the identity for x³ + y³ + z³:\n\nx³ + y³ + z³ = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz.\n\nSo substituting the known values:\n\n4 = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 3*4 ⇒ 4 = S1³ - 3S1*S2 + 12 ⇒ S1³ - 3S1*S2 = -8. (Equation A)\n\nThen, for the third equation, we recognized that:\n\nxy² + x² y + xz² + x² z + yz² + y² z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\n\nWhich gives:\n\n12 = S1*S2 - 3*4 ⇒ S1*S2 = 12 + 12 = 24. (Equation B)\n\nSo now, from Equation B: S1*S2 = 24.\n\nFrom Equation A: S1³ - 3*24 = -8 ⇒ S1³ = -8 + 72 = 64 ⇒ S1 = 4.\n\nThen, substituting S1 = 4 into Equation B: 4*S2 = 24 ⇒ S2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, xy + yz + zx = 6. That seems correct. Let me check if there are any possible issues here.\n\nWait, but we have to make sure that the variables x, y, z actually exist such that these equations hold with S1 = 4 and S2 = 6. But since the problem states \"Supposons que x, y, z satisfont les équations\", meaning \"Suppose that x, y, z satisfy the equations\", and asks us to compute xy + yz + zx, so we can assume that such real numbers exist, and the answer is 6. \n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to confirm, we could try to find such numbers. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nGiven S1 = 4, S2 = 6, S3 = 4. So the cubic equation with roots x, y, z is t³ - S1 t² + S2 t - S3 = 0 ⇒ t³ - 4t² + 6t - 4 = 0.\n\nLet me try to factor this cubic. Let's check for rational roots. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTesting t=1: 1 - 4 + 6 -4 = -1 ≠0.\n\nt=2: 8 - 16 + 12 -4 = 0. Yes, t=2 is a root.\n\nSo we can factor (t - 2)(t² - 2t + 2) = 0. The quadratic factor t² - 2t + 2 has discriminant 4 - 8 = -4, so complex roots. Therefore, the real solution is t=2, and two complex roots. So if the problem allows complex numbers, then x, y, z can be 2 and two complex numbers. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's okay. Since the equations are satisfied regardless, the symmetric sums are real numbers, so even if two variables are complex, their product and sum would still be real. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects all variables to be real. But given that the cubic has one real root and two complex roots, unless the original problem specifies, we can still proceed. Since the equations are given for x, y, z (not necessarily real), but the question is about xy + yz + zx, which would be real if the variables are real or complex. However, since we found a real value for xy + yz + zx, that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6}\n</think>\n\nGiven the equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nFirst, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n4 = S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 12\n\\]\nwhere \\( S_1 = x + y + z \\), \\( S_2 = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( S_3 = xyz = 4 \\). This simplifies to:\n\\[\nS_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 = -8 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the third equation. We recognize that:\n\\[\nxy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n12 = S_1S_2 - 12\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nS_1S_2 = 24 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\nFrom Equation 2, we have \\( S_1S_2 = 24 \\). Substituting this into Equation 1:\n\\[\nS_1^3 - 3 \\cdot 24 = -8 \\implies S_1^3 - 72 = -8 \\implies S_1^3 = 64 \\implies S_1 = 4\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( S_1 = 4 \\) in Equation 2:\n\\[\n4S_2 = 24 \\implies S_2 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).", "answer": "6"}

So, the question is asking which level (9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th) has the number of boys taking the bus closest to 135% of the number of girls taking the bus. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what 135% of the number of girls taking the bus means. Since percentages can sometimes be confusing, 135% is the same as 1.35 times the number of girls. So, if I can find the number of girls taking the bus for each level, multiply that by 1.35, and then compare it to the number of boys taking the bus for that same level. The level where the boys' number is closest to that calculated value is the answer.\n\nGiven that there are 300 boys and 300 girls in each level, right? The data in the table gives the percentage of boys and girls taking the bus for each level. So for each level, I can calculate the actual number of boys and girls taking the bus, then check how close the boys' number is to 135% of the girls' number.\n\nLet me start by writing down the percentages from the table:\n\n- 9th level: boys 41.1%, girls 39.4%\n- 10th level: boys 34.4%, girls 33.1%\n- 11th level: boys 20.6%, girls 13.8%\n- 12th level: boys 11.6%, girls 8.6%\n\nFirst, I need to convert these percentages into actual numbers of boys and girls for each level. Since there are 300 boys and 300 girls in each level, the number of boys taking the bus would be (percentage/100)*300, and same for girls.\n\nLet me create a table for each level with the number of boys and girls taking the bus:\n\nStarting with the 9th level:\n- Boys: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300\n- Girls: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300\n\nCalculating these:\nBoys: 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\nGirls: 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a person, these numbers should probably be rounded to whole numbers. However, maybe the problem expects exact percentages rather than rounded numbers? Wait, the question says \"le nombre de garçons prenant le bus est-il le plus proche de 135% du nombre de filles prenant le bus\". It doesn't specify rounding, but since the percentages are given to one decimal place, maybe we can use the exact numbers as per the percentages multiplied by 300. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentages are exact, so the numbers are 41.1% and 39.4%, which are exact. So 41.1% of 300 is exactly 123.3, and 39.4% is exactly 118.2. But since the number of students must be whole numbers, perhaps we should round these to the nearest whole number. However, the problem may not require rounding unless specified. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"le nombre de garçons prenant le bus est-il le plus proche de 135% du nombre de Filipes prenant le bus\". The original percentages are given to one decimal place, but when calculating 135% of the girls, we can get a decimal. The answer choices are levels, so the closest whole number. Therefore, maybe we need to round the numbers first to whole numbers, then compute 135% of the girls' numbers, and see which boys' number is closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can work with the exact percentages and compute the exact value of 135% of the girls' numbers, then see which boys' number is closest. Let me see.\n\nBut the problem is presented as a table with percentages. The numbers in the table are presumably exact percentages, so when calculating the number of students, we can use those percentages multiplied by 300. So for each level, the number of boys taking the bus is 300*(percentage/100), same for girls. Then, 135% of the girls' number is 1.35*(number of girls taking the bus). Then compare that to the number of boys taking the bus. The level where the difference between boys and 1.35*girls is the smallest is the answer.\n\nBut since the numbers are already percentages, maybe we can compute 1.35 times the percentage of girls, then compare that to the percentage of boys. Wait, that might not be the correct approach. Let me think.\n\nIf we take 135% of the number of girls taking the bus, that would be 1.35 * (girls taking the bus). So, if we denote G as the number of girls taking the bus, then 1.35*G is the target number of boys. The number of boys taking the bus is B. We need to find the level where B is closest to 1.35*G.\n\nAlternatively, if we express this in terms of percentages, since B% of 300 and G% of 300, then:\n\nB = 1.35 * G\n\nBut since B and G are percentages, we can write:\n\nB = 1.35 * G\n\nWait, but B and G are percentages, so maybe dividing by 300, we can say:\n\nNumber of boys taking the bus = (B/100)*300\n\nNumber of girls taking the bus = (G/100)*300\n\nSo 1.35 * (G/100)*300 = (B/100)*300\n\nSimplifying, 1.35*G = B\n\nSo, to have B equal to 1.35*G. Therefore, the percentage of boys taking the bus should be 135% of the percentage of girls taking the bus.\n\nBut the problem says \"le nombre de garçons prenant le bus est-il le plus proche de 135% du nombre de Filipes prenant le bus\". So it's not exactly B = 1.35*G, but rather |B - 1.35*G| is minimized.\n\nTherefore, for each level, compute |B - 1.35*G|, and find the level with the smallest difference.\n\nTherefore, we can compute this for each level.\n\nLet's go through each level one by one.\n\nFirst, 9th level: B = 41.1%, G = 39.4%\n\nCompute 1.35*G = 1.35 * 39.4\n\nFirst, 1.35 * 39.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1 * 39.4 = 39.4\n\n0.3 * 39.4 = 11.82\n\n0.05 * 39.4 = 1.97\n\nAdding those together: 39.4 + 11.82 + 1.97 = 53.19\n\nSo 1.35*G = 53.19\n\nBut B is 41.1. So the difference is |41.1 - 53.19| = 12.09\n\nSecond, 10th level: B = 34.4%, G = 33.1%\n\n1.35*G = 1.35*33.1\n\n1*33.1 = 33.1\n\n0.3*33.1 = 9.93\n\n0.05*33.1 = 1.655\n\nTotal: 33.1 + 9.93 + 1.655 = 44.685\n\nDifference: |34.4 - 44.685| = 10.285\n\nThird, 11th level: B = 20.6%, G = 13.8%\n\n1.35*13.8 = ?\n\n1*13.8 = 13.8\n\n0.3*13.8 = 4.14\n\n0.05*13.8 = 0.69\n\nTotal: 13.8 + 4.14 + 0.69 = 18.63\n\nDifference: |20.6 - 18.63| = 1.97\n\nFourth, 12th level: B = 11.6%, G = 8.6%\n\n1.35*8.6 = ?\n\n1*8.6 = 8.6\n\n0.3*8.6 = 2.58\n\n0.05*8.6 = 0.43\n\nTotal: 8.6 + 2.58 + 0.43 = 11.61\n\nDifference: |11.6 - 11.61| = 0.01\n\nWait, the difference here is 0.01, which is very small. So 12th level has a difference of 0.01. That's the smallest difference.\n\nBut let me check all calculations again to be sure.\n\nStarting with 9th level:\n\n1.35 * 39.4:\n\n39.4 * 1 = 39.4\n\n39.4 * 0.3 = 11.82\n\n39.4 * 0.05 = 1.97\n\nAdding up: 39.4 + 11.82 = 51.22 + 1.97 = 53.19. Correct.\n\nDifference |41.1 - 53.19| = 12.09\n\n10th level:\n\n1.35 * 33.1:\n\n33.1 * 1 = 33.1\n\n33.1 * 0.3 = 9.93\n\n33.1 * 0.05 = 1.655\n\nTotal: 33.1 + 9.93 = 43.03 + 1.655 = 44.685\n\nDifference |34.4 - 44.685| = 10.285\n\n11th level:\n\n1.35 * 13.8:\n\n13.8 + 4.14 + 0.69 = 18.63\n\nDifference |20.6 - 18.63| = 1.97\n\n12th level:\n\n1.35 * 8.6:\n\n8.6 + 2.58 + 0.43 = 11.61\n\nDifference |11.6 - 11.61| = 0.01\n\nSo indeed, the 12th level has the smallest difference of 0.01. Therefore, the answer should be 12th level.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Because the problem says \"le nombre de garçons prenant le bus est-il le plus proche de 135% du nombre de Filipes prenant le bus\". So the number of boys is closest to 135% of the number of girls. So, the number of boys (which is 300*(B/100)) should be closest to 135% of the number of girls (300*(G/100)).\n\nAlternatively, since 300 is common, we can factor that out:\n\n300*(B/100) ≈ 1.35*300*(G/100)\n\nWhich simplifies to B ≈ 1.35*G\n\nSo, same as before. Therefore, the percentage of boys should be approximately 135% of the percentage of girls. So the calculation is correct. So 12th level has B = 11.6 and 1.35*G = 11.61, so difference is 0.01. That's the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th level.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify with another approach. Maybe compute the exact number of boys and girls, then calculate 135% of girls and see the difference.\n\nFor 9th level:\n\nBoys: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411*300 = 123.3\n\nGirls: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394*300 = 118.2\n\n135% of girls: 1.35*118.2 = ?\n\n1.35*100 = 135, 1.35*18 = 24.3, 1.35*0.2 = 0.27\n\nWait, 118.2 = 100 + 18 + 0.2\n\nSo 1.35*100 = 135\n\n1.35*18 = 24.3\n\n1.35*0.2 = 0.27\n\nTotal: 135 + 24.3 + 0.27 = 159.57\n\nSo 135% of girls is 159.57. The number of boys is 123.3. The difference is |123.3 - 159.57| = 36.27\n\nSimilarly, for 10th level:\n\nBoys: 34.4% of 300 = 0.344*300 = 103.2\n\nGirls: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331*300 = 99.3\n\n135% of girls: 1.35*99.3\n\n1.35*100 = 135, minus 1.35*0.7 = 0.945, so 135 - 0.945 = 134.055\n\nDifference |103.2 - 134.055| =", "answer": "12"}
{"original_question": "Résoudre\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "question": "Résoudre\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the inequality |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this inequality is asking. The fraction has an absolute value in the numerator and a quadratic expression in the denominator. Since the inequality is less than zero, that means the entire fraction must be negative. \n\nFirst, I remember that a fraction is negative when the numerator and denominator have opposite signs. So, either the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. But since the numerator is an absolute value, it can't be negative. Absolute values are always non-negative, right? So the numerator |x² - 81| is always ≥ 0. Therefore, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative. Because if the numerator is positive or zero, and the denominator is negative, then the fraction is negative. If the numerator is zero, then the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality < 0. So, essentially, the inequality simplifies to the denominator being negative, provided that the numerator is not zero. \n\nWait, let me check that. If numerator is zero, then the expression is zero, which is not less than zero. So, we can say that |x² - 81| / (x² - 36x) < 0 is equivalent to x² - 36x < 0, but with the condition that |x² - 81| ≠ 0. Because if the numerator is zero, the expression is zero, which isn't less than zero. So, we need to solve x² - 36x < 0, and exclude the points where |x² - 81| = 0. \n\nLet me write that down step by step. \n\nFirst, solve the inequality in the denominator: x² - 36x < 0. \n\nFactor the denominator: x(x - 36) < 0. \n\nSo, the critical points are x = 0 and x = 36. To determine where the expression is negative, we can test intervals. \n\nThe critical points divide the number line into three intervals: \n1. x < 0 \n2. 0 < x < 36 \n3. x > 36 \n\nTesting each interval:\n\n1. For x < 0: Let's pick x = -1. Then (-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0. So positive. \n2. For 0 < x < 36: Let's pick x = 10. Then 10(10 - 36) = 10(-26) = -260 < 0. So negative. \n3. For x > 36: Let's pick x = 40. Then 40(40 - 36) = 40(4) = 160 > 0. So positive. \n\nTherefore, x² - 36x < 0 when 0 < x < 36. \n\nBut we also need to exclude the points where the numerator is zero. The numerator is |x² - 81| = 0 when x² - 81 = 0. Solving that: x² = 81 → x = ±9. \n\nSo, x = 9 and x = -9. \n\nBut wait, x = -9 is in the interval x < 0, which we already considered. So, we need to exclude x = -9 and x = 9 from the solution set. \n\nBut wait, x = 9 is in the interval 0 < x < 36? Wait, 9 is between 0 and 36, right? 0 < 9 < 36. So, x = 9 is inside the interval where the denominator is negative. But we need to exclude x = 9 because at x = 9, the numerator is zero, making the entire expression zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. \n\nSimilarly, x = -9 is in the interval x < 0, which was part of the solution for the denominator. So, we need to exclude x = -9 as well. \n\nTherefore, combining these results, the solution set is 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9. \n\nBut let me verify that. Let's check x = 9. At x = 9, denominator is 9² - 36*9 = 81 - 324 = -243, which is negative. Numerator is |81 - 81| = 0. So, 0 / (-243) = 0, which is not less than zero. So, x = 9 must be excluded. \n\nSimilarly, x = -9: denominator is (-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405, which is positive. Numerator is |(-9)^2 - 81| = |81 - 81| = 0. So, again, the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, both x = 9 and x = -9 are excluded. \n\nTherefore, the solution is 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9. But wait, x = -9 is not in the interval 0 < x < 36, so we only need to exclude x = 9. \n\nWait, but the original denominator is x² - 36x. Let me check if x = -9 is in the denominator's domain. The denominator can't be zero. So, x² - 36x ≠ 0. Solving x² - 36x = 0 gives x(x - 36) = 0, so x = 0 or x = 36. Therefore, x = -9 is not a point where the denominator is zero, so x = -9 is allowed. Wait, but the numerator is zero at x = -9, which makes the entire expression zero. So, even though the denominator is not zero there, the numerator is. Therefore, x = -9 must be excluded from the solution set. \n\nBut in the interval where the denominator is negative (0 < x < 36), x = -9 is not in that interval, so we don't have to exclude it there. But x = -9 is a separate point where the expression is zero, so we need to exclude it regardless. \n\nTherefore, the solution is 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9. \n\nBut let me test a value in each interval to make sure. \n\nFirst, let's check x between -∞ and -9. Let's pick x = -10. Denominator: (-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460 > 0. Numerator: |(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19 > 0. So, 19 / 460 > 0. So, this interval is not part of the solution. \n\nNext, between -9 and 0. Let's pick x = -5. Denominator: 25 - 36*(-5) = 25 + 180 = 205 > 0. Numerator: |25 - 81| = | -56 | = 56 > 0. So, 56 / 205 > 0. Not part of the solution. \n\nBetween 0 and 9: Let's pick x = 1. Denominator: 1 - 36 = -35 < 0. Numerator: |1 - 81| = 80 > 0. So, 80 / (-35) < 0. So, this interval is part of the solution, except x = 9. \n\nBetween 9 and 36: Let's pick x = 18. Denominator: 18² - 36*18 = 324 - 648 = -324 < 0. Numerator: |324 - 81| = |243| = 243 > 0. So, 243 / (-324) < 0. So, this interval is part of the solution, except x = 9. \n\nBetween 36 and ∞: Let's pick x = 40. Denominator: 1600 - 36*40 = 1600 - 1440 = 160 > 0. Numerator: |1600 - 81| = 1519 > 0. So, 1519 / 160 > 0. Not part of the solution. \n\nAt x = 9: Expression is 0 / (81 - 324) = 0, which is not less than zero. So, excluded. \n\nAt x = 0: Denominator is 0, so undefined. Excluded. \n\nAt x = 36: Denominator is 36² - 36*36 = 0, so undefined. Excluded. \n\nTherefore, combining all this, the solution is 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9. \n\nBut let's write that in interval notation. So, (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36). \n\nBut let me confirm once more. The denominator is negative between 0 and 36, not including 0 and 36. But the numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9. Since x = -9 is not in the interval (0, 36), we only need to exclude x = 9. So, yes, the solution is (0, 36) without x = 9, which is (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36). \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be written in boxed notation as \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the inequality is \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\), we need to determine where the fraction is negative. Since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the fraction will be negative when the denominator is negative, provided the numerator is not zero.\n\nFirst, solve the inequality in the denominator:\n\\[ x^2 - 36x < 0 \\]\nFactoring the denominator:\n\\[ x(x - 36) < 0 \\]\nThe critical points are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\). Testing intervals around these points, we find the solution is:\n\\[ 0 < x < 36 \\]\n\nNext, we exclude the points where the numerator is zero. The numerator \\(|x^2 - 81| = 0\\) when:\n\\[ x^2 - 81 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x = \\pm 9 \\]\n\nBetween \\(0 < x < 36\\), we exclude \\(x = 9\\). The point \\(x = -9\\) is not in the interval \\(0 < x < 36\\) and is already excluded since the denominator is not zero there. \n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is:\n\\[ (0, 9) \\cup (9, 36) \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}\\).", "answer": "(0,9) \\cup (9,36)"}

So, we have a rectangular field surrounded by a running track. The track is made up of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the maximum possible area of the field.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the track. The Asymptote code shows a rectangle with length 3 units and width 2 units, then two semicircles on the ends. Wait, but the actual dimensions might not be to scale here. The problem mentions the track consists of two straight sides (which would be the length and width of the rectangle) and two semicircles. The length of the track is 400 meters. Hmm, so the perimeter of the track is 400 meters. But the track's perimeter isn't the same as the rectangle's perimeter, right? Because the track includes the two semicircles.\n\nSo, let me break it down. The track has two straight parts and two semicircular parts. If the field is a rectangle with length L and width W, then the two straight parts of the track would be the lengths of the rectangle, each of length L, but wait, no. Wait, the Asymptote code shows a rectangle with length 3 and width 2, but the track is on the outside. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing a rectangle from (0,0) to (3,0) to (3,2) to (0,2) to (0,0). Then, it's drawing two semicircles: one on the top side from (3,1) with radius 1, and another on the bottom side from (0,1) with radius 1. Wait, so actually, the track is made up of the two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. But in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is 3 units long and 2 units wide. Then, the semicircles have a radius of 1 unit each. Wait, that might not correspond directly to the problem's variables. The problem says the length of the track is 400 meters, so maybe in the problem, the track is 400 meters, but in the Asymptote code, the units are centimeters or something else? Wait, the Asymptote code is just a diagram, so maybe the actual problem's units are different. But perhaps we can use variables.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. \"A rectangular field is surrounded by a running track, as indicated below. The track consists of two bords of the field and two half-circles. The length of the track is 400 meters. What is the greatest possible area of the field, in square meters?\"\n\nSo, the track is made up of two straight sides (which would be the length and width of the rectangle) and two semicircles. Wait, but in a typical running track around a rectangle, the semicircles would be at the ends, each with a radius equal to half the width of the track. Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the track is like a rectangle with semicircular ends, which is a common running track. But in that case, the total length of the track would be the perimeter of the rectangle plus the circumference of the semicircles. Wait, no. Wait, if the track is around the field, then the track's perimeter would consist of the two straight sections (the length of the field) and the two semicircular sections. But the straight sections would be the length of the field, and the semicircular sections would have a diameter equal to the width of the field. Wait, that seems to make sense.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the field is a rectangle with length L and width W, then the track goes around it. The track would have two straight parts: the length of the field, L, but since the track is on the outside, actually, the straight parts of the track would be longer than L. Wait, no. Wait, no, if the track is the boundary around the field, then the straight parts of the track would align with the sides of the field. So, the length of the track would be the perimeter of the field plus the circumferences of the semicircular ends. Wait, but in reality, a running track around a rectangle has the straight parts as the lengths and widths, and the curved parts as semicircles. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn standard running tracks, the innermost lane has a circumference of 400 meters, but that's a full circle. Wait, no. Wait, a standard running track is an oval, often composed of two straightaways and two semicircular ends. The length around the track is 400 meters for one lap. But in this problem, the track is described as consisting of two bords of the field (which would be the length and width) and two half-circles. Wait, maybe the track is the same as the perimeter of the field, but with semicircular ends instead of straight sides. Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the running track as a rectangle with semicircular ends, making the total track length equal to the perimeter of a rectangle with semicircles, which would make it an oval shape.\n\nSo, if the track is an oval, the total length (perimeter) would be the sum of the two straight sides (which would be the length of the rectangle) and the circumference of the two semicircles (which together make a full circle). So, the perimeter of the track would be 2*L + 2*pi*r, where r is the radius of the semicircular ends. But in the problem, the track is made up of two bords of the field (so the two straight sides) and two half-circles. So, the two half-circles make a full circle, so their combined circumference is 2*pi*r. So, the total perimeter of the track is 2*L + 2*pi*r = 400 meters. But in this problem, the \"bords\" probably refer to the length and width of the field. Wait, but the problem says \"two bords of the field\", which could mean the two sides of the field. Wait, but a rectangle has two length sides and two width sides. So, if the track is made up of two bords (maybe the length and width) and two half-circles, then perhaps the length of the track is the sum of the two lengths and the two circumferences of the semicircles. Wait, that would make the total track length 2*L + 2*(pi*r), where r is the radius of the semicircles.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the field is a rectangle with length 3 and width 2, and the semicircles have a radius of 1. So, the track's perimeter would be 2*(3) + 2*(pi*1) = 6 + 6.28 ≈ 12.28 units. But in the problem, the track's length is 400 meters. So, perhaps in the problem, the length of the track is 400 meters, which is equal to 2*L + 2*pi*r, where L is the length of the straight part (the length of the field) and r is the radius of the semicircular ends. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the semicircles are on the ends of the field, so the radius of the semicircles would be half of the width of the field. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the field is 3 units long and 2 units wide. Then, the semicircles on each end have a radius of 1 unit, which is half the width. So, in general, for the problem, if the field has width W, then the radius of each semicircle is W/2. Therefore, the total perimeter of the track would be 2*L (the two straight sides) plus 2*(pi*(W/2)) (the two semicircles, which make a full circle). So, the total perimeter is 2L + pi*W = 400 meters.\n\nSo, the problem is to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is L*W, given that 2L + pi*W = 400. So, we have a constraint 2L + pi*W = 400, and we need to maximize the area A = L*W.\n\nTo maximize A, we can express A in terms of one variable. Let's solve the constraint equation for L: 2L = 400 - pi*W => L = (400 - pi*W)/2. Then, substitute into A: A = [(400 - pi*W)/2] * W = (400W - pi*W^2)/2. Then, A = (400W - pi*W^2)/2. To find the maximum, take derivative of A with respect to W, set to zero.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a quadratic in W, we can find the vertex. Let me write A as A = (-pi/2)W^2 + 200W. This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so it opens downward, and the vertex is the maximum point.\n\nThe vertex of a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -pi/2, b = 200. So, W = -200/(2*(-pi/2)) = -200/(-pi) = 200/pi. So, W = 200/pi meters. Then, substitute back into L: L = (400 - pi*(200/pi))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100 meters. Therefore, the maximum area is L*W = 100*(200/pi) = 20000/pi ≈ 6366.1977 square meters.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let me check the steps again. The perimeter of the track is 2L + pi*W = 400. Then, area is L*W. Express L in terms of W: L = (400 - pi*W)/2. Then, A = [(400 - pi*W)/2] * W = (400W - pi*W^2)/2. Taking derivative dA/dW = 200 - pi*W. Setting derivative to zero: 200 - pi*W = 0 => W = 200/pi. Then, L = (400 - pi*(200/pi))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the maximum area is 100*(200/pi) = 20000/pi ≈ 6366.2 square meters.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to model this. Wait, the problem says \"two bords of the field and two half-circles\". In the Asymptote code, the bords are the two length sides, and the two half-circles are the ends. So, maybe in the problem, the track is composed of two length sides (so the length of the track would include the two straight parts of the field and the two semicircular parts). Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the field is a rectangle, and the track is around it with the straight parts being the length of the field and the semicircular parts having a radius equal to half the width of the field. So, the total perimeter of the track is 2L + 2*(pi*(W/2)) = 2L + pi*W. So, yes, that's the same as before. Therefore, the model is correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is 20000/pi square meters. But let me compute 20000 divided by pi. Since pi is approximately 3.14159265, 20000 / 3.14159265 ≈ 6366.1977. So, approximately 6366.2 square meters. But since the problem asks for the greatest possible area in square meters, we need to present it as an exact value, which is 20000/pi. But let me check the problem statement again. It says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So, they probably want the exact value, expressed as 20000/pi. But maybe it's better to rationalize or present it in terms of fractions? Wait, 20000/pi is already simplified, so perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, if they want an approximate value, but the problem says \"greatest possible area\", which is likely an exact value, so 20000/pi.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Suppose we have two semicircles, each with radius r. Then, the diameter of each semicircle is 2r. If the semicircles are at the ends of the rectangle, then the width of the field is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, so W = 2r. Therefore, the perimeter of the track is 2L + 2*(pi*r) = 2L + 2*pi*r. But since W = 2r, then r = W/2. Therefore, substituting back, the perimeter is 2L + 2*pi*(W/2) = 2L + pi*W. So, yes, same as before. So, the perimeter equation is 2L + pi*W = 400. Then, area is L*W. So, the maximum area is when L = 100 and W = 200/pi, giving area 100*(200/pi) = 20000/pi.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20000/pi, which is approximately 6366.2, but as an exact value, 20000/pi. So, in boxed form, \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible area of the field is \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}} square meters.\n</think>\n\nGiven a rectangular field surrounded by a running track composed of two straight sides (the length and width of the field) and two semicircular ends, we need to find the maximum possible area of the field when the total length of the track is 400 meters.\n\n1. **Understanding the Track**:\n   - The track consists of two straight sections (length \\( L \\)) and two semicircular sections (total circumference equivalent to one full circle with radius \\( r \\)).\n   - The width of the field \\( W \\) is twice the radius of the semicircular ends, i.e., \\( W = 2r \\).\n\n", "answer": "\\frac{20000}{\\pi}"}

I need to find the value of sin T in triangle RST. The problem says that sin R is 2/5. Hmm, first, I should probably visualize the triangle. The Asymptote code draws a right-angled triangle at S, right? Because there's a right angle mark at S. Wait, no, the right angle is at S? Let me check the Asymptote code again. The code defines T at (0,0), S at (2,0), and R at (2, sqrt(21)). So connecting R to S to T and back to R. Then there's a right angle mark at S. Wait, but in the coordinates, S is at (2,0) and T is at (0,0), so the line from S to T is horizontal. Then R is at (2, sqrt(21)), so the line from R to S is vertical? Wait, no, because R is at (2, sqrt(21)), so if S is at (2,0), then RS is a vertical line of length sqrt(21). Then ST is the horizontal line from S(2,0) to T(0,0), which is length 2. Then RT connects R(2, sqrt(21)) to T(0,0). But the right angle is at S? Wait, because the right angle mark is at S. Let me confirm the right angle. If S is at (2,0), T is at (0,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)), then the sides at S are SP and SQ. Wait, actually, in the drawing, the right angle is at S, so the two legs are SP and SQ. But according to the coordinates, SP would be ST, which is horizontal from S to T, and SQ would be SR, which is vertical from S to R. So yes, the right angle is at S. Therefore, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S. That makes sense.\n\nSo, angle at S is 90 degrees, angle at R is given with sin R = 2/5, and we need to find sin T.\n\nWait, in a right-angled triangle, the angles other than the right angle are complementary. So angle R and angle T add up to 90 degrees. Therefore, sin T should be equal to cos R, because sin(90 - x) = cos x. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sides to compute sin T directly.\n\nLet me confirm the sides. Since the triangle is right-angled at S, the sides opposite the angles are:\n\n- Opposite angle R: ST, which is 2 units long (from S(2,0) to T(0,0))\n- Opposite angle T: RS, which is sqrt(21) units long (from R(2, sqrt(21)) to S(2,0))\n- Hypotenuse RT: which we can compute using Pythagoras.\n\nBut wait, the hypotenuse would be RT. Let me compute its length. The coordinates of R are (2, sqrt(21)) and T are (0,0). So the distance between R and T is sqrt[(2 - 0)^2 + (sqrt(21) - 0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 21] = sqrt[25] = 5. So the hypotenuse RT is 5 units long. That's why the problem mentions that RS is 5 units. Wait, RS is sqrt(21), RT is 5. So in triangle RST, right-angled at S, with hypotenuse RT = 5, side ST = 2, side RS = sqrt(21). Wait, hold on: ST is 2, RS is sqrt(21), and RT is 5. So, in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, which is RT = 5. Then the other two sides are 2 and sqrt(21). Let me check if 2^2 + (sqrt(21))^2 equals 5^2. 4 + 21 = 25, which is 25. Yes, that works. So it's a right-angled triangle with legs 2 and sqrt(21), hypotenuse 5.\n\nNow, angle R is at vertex R, which is (2, sqrt(21)). So angle R is one of the acute angles. The sine of angle R is given as 2/5. Let's verify that. In triangle RST, angle R is at R. The side opposite angle R is ST, which is 2. The hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. Therefore, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/RT = 2/5. That's correct. So that matches the given information.\n\nNow, angle T is at vertex T, which is (0,0). The side opposite angle T is RS, which is sqrt(21). The hypotenuse is still RT = 5. Therefore, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = RS/RT = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(21)/5. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since angle R and angle T are complementary, sin T = cos R. Let's compute cos R. In triangle RST, cos R = adjacent/hypotenuse. The angle at R is adjacent to side RS (length sqrt(21)) and hypotenuse RT (5). Wait, no. Wait, angle R is at vertex R, so the adjacent sides are RS and RT? Wait, no. In a right-angled triangle, each acute angle has the adjacent side as one leg and the hypotenuse. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, in triangle RST, right-angled at S. So angle R is at R. The sides adjacent to angle R are RS and RT? Wait, no. Let's think. In a right-angled triangle, the two legs are adjacent to both acute angles. So angle R is adjacent to side RS and hypotenuse RT. Wait, angle R is at R, so the sides adjacent to angle R would be the sides connected to R, which are RS and RT. But RS is one leg (opposite angle T), and RT is the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the definitions.\n\nIn any right-angled triangle, for an acute angle, the sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent side is the one that is next to the angle, forming the angle with the hypotenuse.\n\nSo for angle R at vertex R, the sides adjacent to angle R are RS and RT? Wait, but angle R is formed by sides RS and RT? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle RST, vertex R is connected to vertices S and T. So the two sides forming angle R are RS and RT. But in a right-angled triangle, one of those sides is the hypotenuse. Wait, hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. The hypotenuse is RT, since the right angle is at S. So sides RS and ST are the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse.\n\nTherefore, angle R is between sides RS and RT. So the side adjacent to angle R is RS (length sqrt(21)), and the side opposite angle R is ST (length 2). Therefore, cos R = adjacent/hypotenuse = RS/RT = sqrt(21)/5. And sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/RT = 2/5, which matches the given information. Therefore, sin T = cos R = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nAlternatively, angle T is at vertex T, right-angled at S. So angle T is formed by sides ST and RT. The side opposite angle T is RS (length sqrt(21)), and the hypotenuse is RT (5). Therefore, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nEither way, we get the same answer. So the value of sin T is sqrt(21)/5.\n\nBut let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recap:\n\n- Triangle RST is right-angled at S.\n\n- Therefore, sides:\n\n  - ST: horizontal leg, length 2.\n\n  - RS: vertical leg, length sqrt(21).\n\n  - RT: hypotenuse, length 5.\n\n- Angle R is at vertex R (coordinates (2, sqrt(21))).\n\n  - Opposite side: ST (2).\n\n  - Hypotenuse: RT (5).\n\n  - Therefore, sin R = 2/5. Correct.\n\n- Angle T is at vertex T (coordinates (0,0)).\n\n  - Opposite side: RS (sqrt(21)).\n\n  - Hypotenuse: RT (5).\n\n  - Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, since angles R and T are complementary, sin T = cos R. Since cos R = sqrt(21)/5, then sin T = sqrt(21)/5. That also checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in a right-angled triangle, the sine of one acute angle is the cosine of the other. Since they add up to 90 degrees, sin T = cos R. So if sin R = 2/5, then cos R = sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. All approaches lead to the same answer. So I'm confident that sin T is sqrt(21)/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\sin{T}$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.\n</think>\n\nIn $\\triangle RST$, we are given that $\\sin R = \\frac{2}{5}$ and the triangle is right-angled at $S$.

Trouvez $a+b$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Then express that minimum distance as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Finally, find a + b. Alright, let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) is given by the formula √(x² + y²). So, to find the minimum distance, I need to minimize this expression. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, minimizing √(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance, which is x² + y². That might be easier to work with because it avoids dealing with the square root.\n\nGiven that y is expressed in terms of x, I can substitute the expression for y into the distance squared formula. So, let's do that.\n\nThe function is y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Let's compute y²:\n\ny² = [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nTherefore, the square of the distance, let's call it D, is:\n\nD = x² + y² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum value of D with respect to x. To do this, I can take the derivative of D with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then verify that it's a minimum using the second derivative test or by checking intervals.\n\nLet me compute the derivative D':\n\nFirst, expand the (x² - 3)² term to make differentiation easier:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9.\n\nSo, D = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9) = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + (9/2) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2.\n\nNow, take the derivative:\n\nD' = d/dx [(1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2] = (1/2)*4x³ - 4x + 0 = 2x³ - 4x.\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n2x³ - 4x = 0.\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x² - 2) = 0.\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 0 and x² - 2 = 0 ⇒ x = ±√2.\n\nTherefore, the critical points are at x = -√2, 0, √2.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate D at these points to see which gives the minimum distance.\n\nFirst, compute D at x = 0:\n\nD(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nThen, compute D at x = √2:\n\nD(√2) = (1/2)(√2)^4 - 2(√2)^2 + 9/2.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so (1/2)*4 = 2.\n\n(√2)^2 = 2, so -2*(2) = -4.\n\nTherefore, D(√2) = 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 9/2 = ( -4/2 + 9/2 ) = 5/2.\n\nSimilarly, D(-√2) will be the same since x is squared in the expression, so it's also 5/2.\n\nNow, compare the values: at x = 0, D is 9/2 = 4.5, and at x = ±√2, D is 5/2 = 2.5. So, the minimum occurs at x = ±√2 with D = 5/2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance squared is 5/2, so the minimum distance is √(5/2) = √10 / 2. Wait, let me check that.\n\n√(5/2) can be written as (√5)/√2. To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2:\n\n(√5 * √2)/ (√2 * √2) = √10 / 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimum distance is √10 / 2. Therefore, in the form √a / b, we have a = 10 and b = 2. Check if a is square-free: 10 factors into 2 * 5, neither of which are squares. So, a = 10 is square-free. Then a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, before finalizing, let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the expression for D was x² + y². Substituted y correctly: y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), so y² = (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Then expanding (x² - 3)^2 correctly gives x⁴ -6x² +9. Then multiplied by 1/2: (1/2)x⁴ -3x² + 9/2. Then added x² to get D = (1/2)x⁴ -2x² +9/2. Correct.\n\nDerivative: 2x³ -4x. Factored as 2x(x² -2). So critical points at 0 and ±√2. Correct.\n\nEvaluating D at x=0: 9/2, at x=√2: substituted back, got 5/2. Correct. So 5/2 is less than 9/2, so indeed minimum at ±√2. Then distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt10 / 2. Yes, rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt10 over 2. So a=10, b=2. 10 is square-free, so a + b = 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12. Hmm, seems straightforward. Did I miss anything? Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. For example, using Lagrange multipliers, but that's overkill here. Since we can express y in terms of x, substitution is the way to go. The calculation seems right. The critical points found are correct, and the second derivative test could be used to confirm it's a minimum, but since we have only one positive critical point (excluding x=0 which gives a larger distance), and since the function tends to infinity as x approaches ±infinity, the minimum must be at ±√2. So I think this is correct.\n\nAnother way: compute the second derivative at x=√2. Let's see.\n\nFirst derivative D' = 2x³ -4x.\n\nSecond derivative D'' = 6x² -4.\n\nAt x=√2, D'' = 6*(2) -4 = 12 -4 = 8 > 0, so concave up, which means it's a local minimum. Similarly at x=-√2, same second derivative. So yes, those are local minima. Since the function D is a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the global minimum is at those points. So that's confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we start by expressing the squared distance \\( D \\) from the origin to a point \\((x, y)\\) as:\n\n\\[\nD = x^2 + y^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\) into the distance formula, we get:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the squared distance becomes:\n\n\\[\nD = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the expression for \\( D \\):\n\n\\[\nD = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, we take the derivative of \\( D \\) with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nD' = 2x^3 - 4x\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 4x = 0 \\implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\implies x = 0 \\text{ or } x = \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nEvaluating \\( D \\) at these critical points:\n\n- At \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nD(0) = \\frac{9}{2}\n\\]\n\n- At \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nD(\\pm \\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \\frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe minimum value of \\( D \\) is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\), so the minimum distance is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2}\n\\]\n\nExpressing this in the form \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{b} \\), we have \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).

That means, for a given y-value, I need to find the x that maps to it through f. Since the function is piecewise, I have to consider both pieces separately and see where the solutions for x might lie.\n\nFirst, let's break down the function f(x). For x less than or equal to 3, f(x) = 3 - x. That's a linear function with a negative slope, decreasing. For x greater than 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. That's a cubic function. Cubic functions can be a bit trickier because they can have different shapes, but since the leading coefficient is negative, as x approaches positive infinity, the function will go to negative infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, it will go to positive infinity.

Therefore, we need to solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\nx² - 2x - 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, 1 and -3? 1 * (-3) = -3 and 1 + (-3) = -2. Yes, so:\n\n(x + 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nTherefore, x = -1 or x = 3. But x > 3 in this case, so neither of these solutions are in the domain x > 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case for f(x) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 3. So f inverse(0) = 3.\n\nNow, moving on to f inverse(6). So we need to solve f(x) = 6 for x.\n\nAgain, split into the two cases.\n\nCase 1: x ≤ 3\n\nf(x) = 3 - x. Set equal to 6:\n\n3 - x = 6\n\nSolving:\n\n- x = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nx = -3\n\nCheck if x = -3 is ≤ 3. Yes, it is. So that's a valid solution.\n\nCase 2: x > 3\n\nf(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set equal to 6:\n\n- x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6\n\nBring 6 to the left:\n\n- x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\nx³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, need to solve this cubic equation. Let's try to factor it. Maybe using rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.\n\nTest x = 1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nx = 2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nDivide x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 by (x - 2):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  -2  -3   6\n\nMultiply 2*1 = 2, add to -2: 0\n\nMultiply 2*0 = 0, add to -3: -3\n\nMultiply 2*(-3) = -6, add to 6: 0\n\nSo the quotient is x² + 0x - 3. Therefore:\n\nx³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = (x - 2)(x² - 3)\n\nSo set that equal to zero:\n\n(x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0\n\nSolutions are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3)\n\nNow, in the case where x > 3, we need to check which of these roots satisfy x > 3.\n\nx = 2: 2 > 3? No.\n\nx = sqrt(3): approximately 1.732, which is less than 3. No.\n\nx = -sqrt(3): negative, which is less than 3. No.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions in the x > 3 case. Therefore, the only solution for f(x) = 6 is x = -3.\n\nTherefore, f inverse(6) = -3.\n\nTherefore, f inverse(0) + f inverse(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the answer is 0? Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for f inverse(0):\n\nCase 1: x ≤ 3, 3 - x = 0 → x = 3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: x > 3, solved equation -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factored out x, got x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. Then solving -x² + 2x + 3 = 0 leads to x = -1 or 3. But x > 3, so no solutions. Correct.\n\nSo f inverse(0) = 3.\n\nFor f inverse(6):\n\nCase 1: x ≤ 3, 3 - x = 6 → x = -3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: x > 3, equation -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Which simplifies to x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0. Found root x = 2, then factored into (x - 2)(x² - 3). The other roots are sqrt(3) and -sqrt(3), none of which are > 3. So only x = -3. Correct.\n\nSo f inverse(6) = -3.\n\nAdding them: 3 + (-3) = 0. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there's another solution in the cubic equation for f inverse(6). Wait, in the cubic equation, we had x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0. The roots are 2, sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). But sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is less than 3, so not in the domain. So indeed, only x = -3 is valid. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 0. So f inverse(0) + f inverse(6) = 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \\) for the given piecewise function:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n3 - x & \\text{ if } x \\leq 3, \\\\\n-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \\text{ if } x > 3,\n\\end{array}\n\\right. \\]\n\nwe need to solve for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 6 \\), then sum the solutions.\n\n**For \\( f^{-1}(0) \\):**\n\n1. **Case \\( x \\leq 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   3 - x = 0 \\implies x = 3\n   \\]\n   Since \\( 3 \\leq 3 \\), this is valid.

Hmm, let me think. First, I should recall what a regular octahedron looks like. It's a Platonic solid with eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. The vertices are arranged such that each face is an equilateral triangle. The Asymptote code draws the octahedron with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and a point P somewhere in space. The drawing is perspective, so it's a bit hard to visualize in 3D, but maybe I can figure it out using coordinates.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, they define the vertices as A(1,0,0), B(-1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,-1,0), E(0,0,1), F(0,0,-1). Wait, so these are the six vertices of the regular octahedron. Let me confirm: in a regular octahedron, all edges are equal, and each vertex is connected to four others. Let me check the coordinates. The distance between A(1,0,0) and C(0,1,0) is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt(2). Similarly, the distance between A and E is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2] = sqrt(2). So all edges are of length sqrt(2). The coordinates seem to form a regular octahedron centered at the origin with vertices along the axes.\n\nNow, point P is given as (1.2, 1.5, 1). Wait, but in the Asymptote code, P is drawn in red, and the edges from P to each of the vertices are shown. But according to the coordinates, E is (0,0,1) and F is (0,0,-1). So P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Let me check the distances. For example, the distance from P to A(1,0,0) would be sqrt[(1.2-1)^2 + (1.5-0)^2 + (1-0)^2] = sqrt[0.04 + 2.25 + 1] = sqrt[3.29] ≈ 1.813. But in the problem statement, the distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. That's way larger. So maybe the coordinates given in the Asymptote code are just for the figure, not the actual problem's coordinates. The problem is abstract, so the actual coordinates of P are unknown, except that its distances to five of the six vertices are given.\n\nSo the problem is: given a regular octahedron with six vertices, and a point P in space such that the distances from P to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.\n\nI need to find a way to relate these distances. Maybe using the properties of a regular octahedron. Let me recall that in a regular octahedron, the centroid (center) is equidistant from all vertices. If the octahedron is centered at the origin, then each vertex is equidistant from the origin. However, in this problem, the distances from P to the vertices are not equal, so P is not at the center. But how does this affect the distances?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or theorem related to distances from a point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron. I don't recall one off the top of my head, but perhaps there's a coordinate geometry approach.\n\nSince the octahedron is regular, it's symmetric, so maybe we can assign coordinates to the vertices and set up equations based on the given distances. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's assign coordinates to the octahedron. A regular octahedron can be represented with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). Let me confirm that this is a regular octahedron. The distance between any two adjacent vertices, say (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt(2). Similarly, distance between (1,0,0) and (0,0,1) is sqrt(2), etc. So all edges are of length sqrt(2). So this is indeed a regular octahedron centered at the origin with vertices along the axes.\n\nSo let's denote the vertices as follows:\n\nA: (1, 0, 0)\n\nB: (-1, 0, 0)\n\nC: (0, 1, 0)\n\nD: (0, -1, 0)\n\nE: (0, 0, 1)\n\nF: (0, 0, -1)\n\nNow, point P is somewhere in space. Let the coordinates of P be (x, y, z). The distances from P to the vertices are:\n\nPA: sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]\n\nPB: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]\n\nPC: sqrt[x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2]\n\nPD: sqrt[x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2]\n\nPE: sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2]\n\nPF: sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]\n\nGiven that five of these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and we need to find the sixth.\n\nBut since the problem states \"les distances d'un point P à cinq des sommets d'un octaèdre regular sont 3, 7, 8, 9 et 11. Trouver la distance de P au sixème sommet.\" So five distances are given, and we need the sixth.\n\nFirst, perhaps there's a relation between the squares of the distances. Let me square the distances to simplify the equations.\n\nLet me denote the squared distances as follows:\n\nPA² = (x - 1)^2 + y² + z²\n\nPB² = (x + 1)^2 + y² + z²\n\nPC² = x² + (y - 1)^2 + z²\n\nPD² = x² + (y + 1)^2 + z²\n\nPE² = x² + y² + (z - 1)^2\n\nPF² = x² + y² + (z + 1)^2\n\nGiven five of these squared distances, and need the sixth.\n\nSuppose we take the differences between PA² and PB², for example:\n\nPA² - PB² = [(x - 1)^2 + y² + z²] - [(x + 1)^2 + y² + z²] = (x² - 2x + 1) - (x² + 2x + 1) = -4x\n\nSimilarly, PC² - PD² = [x² + (y - 1)^2 + z²] - [x² + (y + 1)^2 + z²] = (y² - 2y + 1) - (y² + 2y + 1) = -4y\n\nSimilarly, PE² - PF² = [x² + y² + (z - 1)^2] - [x² + y² + (z + 1)^2] = (z² - 2z + 1) - (z² + 2z + 1) = -4z\n\nSo these differences give us linear equations for x, y, z. For example, PA² - PB² = -4x, so x = (PB² - PA²)/4\n\nSimilarly, y = (PD² - PC²)/4, z = (PE² - PF²)/4\n\nBut since we don't know which distances correspond to which vertices, this complicates things. Wait, but the problem states that five distances are given. So five of the six squared distances are known. Let's denote them as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and we need to find the sixth, d6.\n\nBut perhaps there's a relation between the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octahedron. Let me recall that in some symmetric configurations, such as regular polyhedrons, there might be a formula for the sum of squared distances.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the octahedron is centered at the origin. Then, for any point P(x, y, z), the sum of the squares of the distances to the six vertices can be calculated as follows:\n\nSum = PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF²\n\n= [(x - 1)^2 + y² + z²] + [(x + 1)^2 + y² + z²] + [x² + (y - 1)^2 + z²] + [x² + (y + 1)^2 + z²] + [x² + y² + (z - 1)^2] + [x² + y² + (z + 1)^2]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nExpand each term:\n\n(x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1\n\n(x + 1)^2 = x² + 2x + 1\n\nSimilarly, (y - 1)^2 = y² - 2y + 1\n\n(y + 1)^2 = y² + 2y + 1\n\n(z - 1)^2 = z² - 2z + 1\n\n(z + 1)^2 = z² + 2z + 1\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\nFor x-coordinates:\n\n(x - 1)^2 + (x + 1)^2 + x² + x² + x² + x²\n\n= (x² - 2x + 1) + (x² + 2x + 1) + 4x²\n\n= (2x² + 2) + 4x²\n\n= 6x² + 2\n\nSimilarly for y-coordinates:\n\ny² + y² + (y - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + y² + y²\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, let's redo:\n\nEach term contributes x², y², z² terms as follows:\n\nFirst term (PA²): x² - 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\nSecond term (PB²): x² + 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\nThird term (PC²): x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²\n\nFourth term (PD²): x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²\n\nFifth term (PE²): x² + y² + z² - 2z + 1\n\nSixth term (PF²): x² + y² + z² + 2z + 1\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\nFor x² terms:\n\nPA²: 1 x²\n\nPB²: 1 x²\n\nPC²: 1 x²\n\nPD²: 1 x²\n\nPE²: 1 x²\n\nPF²: 1 x²\n\nTotal x² terms: 6x²\n\nFor y² terms:\n\nPA²: 1 y²\n\nPB²: 1 y²\n\nPC²: 1 y²\n\nPD²: 1 y²\n\nPE²: 1 y²\n\nPF²: 1 y²\n\nTotal y² terms: 6y²\n\nFor z² terms:\n\nAll terms have 1 z², so total 6z²\n\nFor linear terms:\n\nPA²: -2x\n\nPB²: +2x\n\nPC²: -2y\n\nPD²: +2y\n\nPE²: -2z\n\nPF²: +2z\n\nSo combining:\n\n-2x + 2x = 0\n\n-2y + 2y = 0\n\n-2z + 2z = 0\n\nConstant terms:\n\nPA²: 1\n\nPB²: 1\n\nPC²: 1\n\nPD²: 1\n\nPE²: 1\n\nPF²: 1\n\nTotal constants: 6\n\nTherefore, the sum of all six squared distances is:\n\n6x² + 6y² + 6z² + 6 = 6(x² + y² + z² + 1)\n\nBut since the octahedron is centered at the origin, x² + y² + z² is the squared distance from P to the origin. Let's denote OP² = x² + y² + z². Then the total sum is 6(OP² + 1).\n\nBut how does this help? If we know five of the squared distances, we can compute the sum of the five, subtract from the total sum, and get the sixth. But we don't know OP². However, maybe there's another relation.\n\nAlternatively, since the octahedron is regular, maybe the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to all vertices can be expressed in terms of OP². Let's check:\n\nSum = 6(OP² + 1) = 6(x² + y² + z² + 1). So if we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of OP², but that's trivial. Wait, maybe there's another formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a relation between the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices and the sum of the squares of the distances to the center. Wait, but I already considered that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in a regular octahedron, the coordinates are symmetric. Let me think. Suppose we take the given distances, square them, and try to set up equations.\n\nLet me denote the given distances squared as follows: suppose the five given distances are d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and the sixth is d6. Then, the sum of all six squared distances is 6(OP² + 1). Therefore, if we can compute the sum of the five given distances, we can find d6.\n\nBut we don't know OP². However, maybe there's another relation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the octahedron can be inscribed in a sphere. The vertices lie on a sphere of radius sqrt(2) (since each vertex is at distance sqrt(1^2 + 0 + 0) = 1 from the origin, but wait, in our", "answer": "\\sqrt{66}"}

Répondez sous forme de fraction irréductible.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about Jen and Jack throwing baseballs and softball, and we need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball compared to Jack's baseball. Both are being propelled with the same force. Hmm, right, the formula we're supposed to use is Newton's second law, which says force equals mass times acceleration. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formula: F = m * a. So, if the force is the same for both Jen and Jack, then the masses of their respective balls must be different, which they are. The softball is 200 grams, and the baseball is 150 grams. But wait, grams and kilograms? Oh, right, the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. Maybe I should convert those grams to kilograms to keep the units consistent. \n\n200 grams is 0.2 kilograms, and 150 grams is 0.15 kilograms. Let me double-check that. Yes, 1 gram is 0.001 kilograms, so 200 grams is 0.2 kg and 150 grams is 0.15 kg. \n\nSo, both balls are being hit with the same force, let's say F. For Jen's softball, the force F is equal to 0.2 kg times her acceleration, which we can call a_Jen. Similarly, for Jack's baseball, the force F is equal to 0.15 kg times his acceleration, a_Jack. \n\nSo, writing those equations out:\n\nF = 0.2 * a_Jen\n\nF = 0.15 * a_Jack\n\nSince both forces are equal, I can set these two equations equal to each other. That means:\n\n0.2 * a_Jen = 0.15 * a_Jack\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of a_Jen to a_Jack. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. \n\nDivide both sides by 0.15 * a_Jen:\n\nWait, maybe it's better to solve for a_Jen / a_Jack. Let me try that. \n\nStarting from 0.2 * a_Jen = 0.15 * a_Jack, divide both sides by 0.15 * a_Jen:\n\n(0.2 / 0.15) = (a_Jack / a_Jen)\n\nSo, the ratio of a_Jack to a_Jen is 0.2 / 0.15. Therefore, the ratio of a_Jen to a_Jack would be the reciprocal of that. \n\nSo, (a_Jen / a_Jack) = 0.15 / 0.2\n\nLet me compute that. 0.15 divided by 0.2. Hmm, 0.15 divided by 0.2 is the same as 15 divided by 20, which simplifies to 3/4. Wait, 15/20 is 3/4? Let me check: 15 divided by 5 is 3, 20 divided by 5 is 4. Yes, so 15/20 is 3/4. So, 0.15 / 0.2 = 3/4. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration is 3/4. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The equation was 0.2 * a_Jen = 0.15 * a_Jack. So, solving for a_Jen / a_Jack:\n\na_Jen / a_Jack = 0.15 / 0.2 = 3/4. \n\nYes, that's correct. So, Jen's ball has 3/4 the acceleration of Jack's ball. Wait, but intuitively, if you throw a heavier ball with the same force, the acceleration should be less, right? Because F = m*a. So, if mass increases, acceleration decreases for the same force. Since the softball is heavier (200g vs 150g), it would have less acceleration. Therefore, Jen's acceleration is less than Jack's. So, the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's is 3/4, which is less than 1, which makes sense. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure. Both balls are hit with the same force. The formula F = m*a tells us that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when force is constant. So, the ratio of accelerations is inverse of the ratio of masses. Wait, masses are 0.2 kg and 0.15 kg. So, mass ratio is 0.2 / 0.15 = 4/3. Therefore, acceleration ratio is 0.15 / 0.2 = 3/4. Exactly. So, the ratio is 3/4. \n\nAlternatively, if we write the masses as fractions: 200g is 200/1000 kg = 1/5 kg, and 150g is 150/1000 kg = 3/20 kg. Then, the ratio of masses is (1/5)/(3/20) = (1/5)*(20/3) = 4/3. Therefore, acceleration ratio is 3/4. \n\nYes, that's the same result. So, either way, the ratio is 3/4. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check once more. Suppose the force is the same. If you have a heavier object, you need a smaller acceleration to maintain the same force. So, the acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. So, if mass is 4/3 times larger (since 200g / 150g = 4/3), then acceleration is 3/4 times smaller. Therefore, the ratio is 3/4. \n\nYep, all methods lead to the same answer. So, the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's is 3/4. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball when both are kicked with the same force, we use Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the softball, \\( m_{\\text{softball}} = 200 \\, \\text{g} = 0.2 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Mass of the baseball, \\( m_{\\text{baseball}} = 150 \\, \\text{g} = 0.15 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nBoth objects are kicked with the same force \\( F \\). Therefore, we can write the equations for force as:\n\\[ F = m_{\\text{softball}} \\cdot a_{\\text{Jen}} \\]\n\\[ F = m_{\\text{baseball}} \\cdot a_{\\text{Jack}} \\]\n\nSince the forces are equal, we equate the two equations:\n\\[ 0.2 \\cdot a_{\\text{Jen}} = 0.15 \\cdot a_{\\text{Jack}} \\]\n\nTo find the ratio of accelerations \\( \\frac{a_{\\text{Jen}}}{a_{\\text{Jack}}} \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{a_{\\text{Jen}}}{a_{\\text{Jack}}} = \\frac{0.15}{0.2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{0.15}{0.2} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}}\\).", "answer": "\\frac 34"}

Let me start by converting 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8. Then I'll compare the digits of the two representations and count how many are the same.\n\nFirst, converting 629 to base 7. To do this, I divide 629 by 7 and record the remainders. Let me start the division process:\n\n629 divided by 7. 7*89 = 623, so the quotient is 89 and the remainder is 6. So the least significant digit (rightmost) in base 7 is 6.\n\nNow take 89 and divide by 7. 7*12 = 84, so quotient is 12, remainder 5. Next digit is 5.\n\n12 divided by 7: 7*1 = 7, quotient 1, remainder 5. Next digit is 5.\n\n1 divided by 7: quotient 0, remainder 1. So the most significant digit (leftmost) is 1.\n\nPutting the remainders together from last to first: 1, 5, 5, 6. So 629 in base 7 is 1556_7.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 1*7^3 = 343, 5*7^2=245, 5*7^1=35, 6*7^0=6. 343+245=588, 588+35=623, 623+6=629. Yes, that's correct. So base 7 is 1556.\n\nNow converting 629 to base 8. Let's do similar division by 8.\n\n629 divided by 8: 8*78 = 624, remainder 5. So the rightmost digit is 5.\n\n78 divided by 8: 8*9 =72, remainder 6. Next digit is 6.\n\n9 divided by 8: 8*1=8, remainder 1. Next digit is 1.\n\n1 divided by 8: quotient 0, remainder 1. So the leftmost digit is 1.\n\nPutting them together: 1, 1, 6, 5. So 629 in base 8 is 1165_8.\n\nCheck: 1*8^3=512, 1*8^2=64, 6*8^1=48, 5*8^0=5. 512+64=576, 576+48=624, 624+5=629. Correct. So base 8 is 1165.\n\nNow, compare the two numbers: 1556_7 and 1165_8.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nBase 7: 1 5 5 6\n\nBase 8: 1 1 6 5\n\nNow, compare each digit position by position. Let's index them from right to left (LSB to MSB), or maybe left to right. Wait, the digits in each base are:\n\nBase 7: Thousands place:1, hundreds:5, tens:5, ones:6\n\nBase 8: Thousands place:1, hundreds:1, tens:6, ones:5\n\nWait, but in base 7, the digits are 1 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (ones). In base 8, it's 1 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (ones). Wait, but in base 7, the digits go up to 7^3=343, so 629 is 1*343 +5*49 +5*7 +6*1. In base 8, it's 1*512 +1*64 +6*8 +5*1. So the digit positions correspond to different powers. Wait, but when comparing digits, do we align them by position or just as the number of digits? For example, 1556_7 is four digits and 1165_8 is also four digits. But in base 7, the digits correspond to 7^3, 7^2, 7^1, 7^0. In base 8, they correspond to 8^3, 8^2, 8^1, 8^0. So the actual digit values are in different positions.\n\nBut the question says \"combien de chiffres identiques trouves-t-on dans les represents en base 7 et en base 8 de 629_{10}\". So it's asking how many digits are the same in the two representations, regardless of their positions. So even if a digit appears in a different place, if the digit itself is the same, it counts. So for example, if base 7 had a 1 in the thousands place and base 8 also has a 1 in the thousands place, that's one. Then if base 7 has a 5 in the hundreds place and base 8 has a 1 there, that's different. If base 7 has a 5 in the tens place and base 8 has a 6, that's different. But if base 7 has a 6 in the ones place and base 8 has a 5, that's different. Wait, but wait, maybe the digits are considered as numbers, regardless of their position. So for example, if the digits in base 7 are 1,5,5,6 and in base 8 are 1,1,6,5, then how many digits (as numbers) are the same. So 1,5,5,6 vs 1,1,6,5. So comparing each digit:\n\nFirst digit (leftmost): 1 vs 1 – same.\n\nSecond digit:5 vs1 – different.\n\nThird digit:5 vs6 – different.\n\nFourth digit:6 vs5 – different.\n\nSo only the first digit is the same. So answer is 1?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe the problem is considering digits as positions, like the digit positions. But in that case, the number of digits is the same (4 digits in both). But maybe they are comparing the digits in the same position? Wait, the problem statement says \"Combien de chiffres identiques trouves-t-on dans les represents en base 7 et en base 8 de 629_{10}?\" So \"how many identical digits are found in the representations in base 7 and base 8 of 629\". So it's not about digit positions but just the digits present. So for example, the example given is 121_3 and 413_5. They have a 1 in the middle. So even if they are in different positions, as long as the digit is the same, it counts. So in the example, 121_3 is digits 1,2,1 and 413_5 is digits 4,1,3. So the digit 1 is present in both, so that counts once. So regardless of the position.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, we need to collect all the digits from base 7 and base 8 representations and count how many digits are common between both, regardless of their positions.\n\nSo base 7: 1,5,5,6\n\nBase 8:1,1,6,5\n\nNow, let's list the digits from each:\n\nBase7 digits: 1,5,5,6\n\nBase8 digits:1,1,6,5\n\nNow, the common digits between both sets. So the digits present in both base7 and base8 are 1,5,6. Let's count how many times each occurs.\n\nIn base7: 1 appears once, 5 appears twice, 6 appears once.\n\nIn base8:1 appears twice, 5 appears once, 6 appears once.\n\nSo the intersection of the digits is {1,5,6}. Now, to count how many digits are identical in both representations. But wait, the problem might be asking how many digits (individual instances) are the same in both representations. For example, if a digit appears in both numbers, how many times does it appear in both?\n\nWait, the example given is 121_3 and 413_5. The digit 1 is present in both numbers. But in 121_3, there are two 1s, and in 413_5, there is one 1. So the total number of overlapping digits would be 2 (since 1 appears twice in base3 and once in base5, so overlapping once? Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the problem says \" Combien de chiffres identiques trouves-t-on ? Par exemple, 121_{3} et 413_{5}auraient un chiffre en common.\" So translating the example, the two numbers are 121 base3 and 413 base5. The digit 1 is present in both numbers. So even though in base3 it's two 1s and in base5 it's one 1, the total number of overlapping digits is 1 (since the digit 1 is present in both numbers, regardless of how many times). Wait, but the example says \"un chiffre en common\", which is one digit. But in reality, the digit 1 appears twice in base3 and once in base5, so the total overlapping digits would be one instance of the digit 1. But in the problem statement, the example might just be showing that the digit 1 is common, not the number of times. So maybe the problem is asking how many digits (regardless of their position) are the same in both representations.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, base7: digits are 1,5,5,6; base8:1,1,6,5. So the digits 1,5,6 are common. Now, how many times do these digits appear in both representations?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the number of digits that are identical in both representations, considering each occurrence. For example, in the example, even though 121_3 has two 1s, and 413_5 has one 1, the common digits are two in total (one from each number). Wait, no, the problem says \"Combien de chiffres identiques trouves-t-on ? Par exemple, 121_{3} et 413_{5}auraient un chiffre en common.\" So translating, \"how many identical digits are found in the representations...\". So if the two numbers are 121_3 and 413_5, the digits are 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. The digit 1 is present in both, so the answer is 1. But in reality, the digit 1 appears twice in the first number and once in the second, so there are two digits in the first number and one in the second, but the overlapping digits are just one instance of the digit 1. So the answer is 1. Therefore, the problem is asking for the number of distinct digits that are present in both representations, not the number of times they overlap. So even if a digit appears multiple times in both, it's counted once. So in our problem, the common digits are 1,5,6. Each of these digits appears at least once in both representations. So the count is 3. But wait, in base7, 1 appears once, 5 twice, 6 once. In base8, 1 twice, 5 once, 6 once. So the digits 1,5,6 are present in both. So the answer would be 3. But wait, wait, the example in the problem statement says \"Combien de chiffres identiques trouves-t-on ? Par exemple, 121_{3} et 413_{5}auraient un chiffre en common.\" So in that example, the digits 1 is present in both. So the answer is 1. But according to the problem's example, if it's asking for the number of common digits regardless of their positions, then even if a digit appears multiple times in both, it's counted once. So in the example, 121_3 has digits 1,2,1 and 413_5 has digits 4,1,3. The common digit is 1, so answer is 1. But if we count the number of overlapping digits considering their multiplicities, it would be 2 (from 121_3) and 1 (from 413_5), but since the question is in French, \"Combien de chiffres identiques\", which translates to \"How many identical digits\", which in French usually means the count of distinct digits that are the same in both representations. So in the example, it's 1. So the answer is 1. Therefore, in our problem, we need to count how many distinct digits are present in both base7 and base8 representations. So 1,5,6 are present in both. So the answer is 3. But let's check again.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's example, 121_3 and 413_5 have the digit 1 in common. So even though 121_3 has two 1s and 413_5 has one, the number of common digits is 1, not 2. So it's the count of distinct digits that are present in both numbers. So the problem is asking for the number of distinct digits shared between the two representations. So in our case, how many distinct digits are present in both base7 and base8 representations of 629.\n\nBase7: digits are 1,5,5,6. So digits 1,5,6.\n\nBase8: digits are 1,1,6,5. So digits 1,6,5.\n\nSo the intersection is {1,5,6}. Therefore, three distinct digits. So the answer is 3.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If the problem counts the number of times the digits match in the same position, that would be different. For example, if in the same digit position, the digits are the same, then count that. But the example given doesn't mention anything about positions. It just says \"combien de chiffres identiques\", which is \"how many identical digits\". So in the example, 121_3 and 413_5, the digit 1 is present in both numbers, so the answer is 1. So regardless of where they are, just the number of distinct digits that appear in both. So in our problem, the digits 1,5,6 are present in", "answer": "3"}

Combien de poignées de main ont eu lieu lors du cocktail ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many handshakes there were at this cocktail party between the six necromancers and ten necsiers. Hmm, the problem says that each of the necromancers (there are six) shook hands with each of the necsiers (ten). But also, it mentions that no necromancer shook hands with another necromancer, and none of the necsiers shook hands with another necsier. So, it's only between the necromancers and necsiers that handshakes happened. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. So, there are six women (sorcieres) and ten men (sorciers). Each woman (sorciere) shook hands with each man (sorcier). But none of the women shook hands with other women, and none of the men shook hands with other men. So, it's a classic bipartite graph scenario where edges only exist between the two groups, not within each group.\n\nSo, if I think of it as a handshake problem where there are two groups, Group A with six people and Group B with ten people, and everyone in Group A shakes hands with everyone in Group B. Then the total number of handshakes would just be the product of the number of people in each group. Because each person in Group A does 10 handshakes (one with each person in Group B), so 6 people times 10 handshakes each. \n\nWait, but let me verify. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose there are 2 women and 3 men. Each woman shakes hands with each man. So, the first woman shakes hands with 3 men, and the second woman also shakes hands with 3 men. Total handshakes: 2*3 = 6. If we count individually: Woman 1 with Man 1, Woman 1 with Man 2, Woman 1 with Man 3, Woman 2 with Man 1, Woman 2 with Man 2, Woman 2 with Man 3. That's 6, which matches 2*3. So, yes, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem: 6 necromancers each shaking hands with 10 necsiers. So, 6*10 = 60 handshakes. But wait, the problem mentions \"poignées de main\" which is French for handshakes, right? So, the answer should be 60. \n\nBut hold on, let me check the problem statement again to make sure. It says: \"les sorcieres ont décidé de sainer la main de chacun des sorciers.\" So, \"sainer la main\" translates to \"shaking hands with each of the necsiers.\" So, each sorciere (female) shook hands with each necsier (male). So, yes, each of the six women did 10 handshakes, leading to 60 total. \n\nBut the problem also says: \"Aucune des sorcieres n a pris la peine de se sainer la main...and n'ont pas sainer la main des autres sorciers.\" So, none of the sorciers shook hands with each other. Which aligns with the problem statement that only the siring (shaking hands between different groups) happened. \n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 6*10=60. So, the answer should be 60. Let me just confirm once more. If it were the other way around, like each necsier shaking hands with each sorciere, it would still be the same total, since multiplication is commutative. So, 10*6=60. Either way, it's 60. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 60.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of handshakes between six necromancers (sorcieres) and ten necsiers (sorciers). Each necromancer shakes hands with every necsier, but no handshakes occur between necromancers or necsiers themselves. This is a straightforward combinatorial problem where the total number of handshakes is the product of the two groups:\n\n- Number of necromancers: \\(6\\)\n- Number of necsiers: \\(10\\)\n- Total handshakes: \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\)\n\nThus, the number of handshakes during the cocktail is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).", "answer": "60"}

The original polynomial f(x) is given as 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. That's a useful trick because plugging in 1 for x essentially adds up all the coefficients. For example, if a polynomial is ax² + bx + c, then substituting x = 1 gives a + b + c, which is the sum of the coefficients. So, maybe I can use this property here.\n\nBut here, g(x) is f(x - 1), which means I need to substitute (x - 1) into f(x). So, g(x) = f(x - 1) = 3(x - 1)⁴ + 5(x - 1)² - 9(x - 1) - 2. Then, to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x), I can evaluate g(1). Because, as per the trick, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is g(1). That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, actually, let me verify if that's correct. If I have a polynomial h(x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_1x + a_0, then the sum of the coefficients is h(1) = a_n + ... + a_1 + a_0. So, yes, evaluating at x = 1 gives the sum of the coefficients regardless of how the polynomial is constructed. So, even if h(x) is another function, like f(x - 1), then the sum of its coefficients is h(1). Therefore, to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x) = f(x - 1), I just need to compute g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). Wait, is that right?\n\nHold on, let me check that again. If g(x) = f(x - 1), then substituting x = 1 into g(x) gives f(1 - 1) = f(0). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is f(0). But f(0) is just the constant term of f(x). Let me compute f(0): f(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = -2. So, according to this, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) would be -2. Is that correct?\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The sum of the coefficients of g(x) is g(1). Since g(x) = f(x - 1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). So, indeed, the sum of the coefficients is f(0). But f(0) is the constant term of f(x), which is -2. So, the answer is -2? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can expand g(x) = f(x - 1) and then add up all the coefficients. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, expand each term of f(x - 1):\n\n1. The first term is 3(x - 1)^4. Let's expand that:\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1. Multiply by 3: 3x^4 - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.\n\n2. The second term is 5(x - 1)^2. Expand (x - 1)^2: x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5: 5x² - 10x + 5.\n\n3. The third term is -9(x - 1). Expand that: -9x + 9.\n\n4. The fourth term is -2.\n\nNow, combine all these terms together:\n\n3x^4 - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3 + 5x² - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x^4 term: 3x^4.\n\n- x³ term: -12x³.\n\n- x² terms: 18x² + 5x² = 23x².\n\n- x terms: -12x -10x -9x = -31x.\n\n- constants: 3 + 5 + 9 - 2 = 15.\n\nSo, g(x) = 3x^4 -12x³ +23x² -31x +15.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients is 3 -12 +23 -31 +15. Let's compute that:\n\n3 -12 = -9\n\n-9 +23 = 14\n\n14 -31 = -17\n\n-17 +15 = -2.\n\nSo, the sum is indeed -2. Therefore, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. So, the answer is -2.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me check again with the first method. If the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is g(1), then substituting x =1 into g(x) = f(x -1) gives f(0). Since f(x) is 3x⁴ +5x² -9x -2, f(0) is 0 +0 -0 -2 = -2. So, that matches. Therefore, both approaches confirm that the sum is -2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-2}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( g(x) = f(x-1) \\), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \\( h(x) \\) is given by evaluating \\( h(1) \\).\n\nGiven the polynomial \\( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \\), we need to evaluate \\( g(1) \\), which is equivalent to \\( f(0) \\) because \\( g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) \\).\n\nCalculating \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can expand \\( g(x) = f(x-1) \\):\n1.

Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the distance from a point to a line. Let me try to recall. I think it's something like |Ax + By + C| divided by the square root of (A squared plus B squared). But wait, first I need to write the equation of the line in standard form, which is Ax + By + C = 0. The given line is y = 2x - 2. Let me rearrange that.\n\nStarting with y = 2x - 2, if I subtract 2x from both sides, I get -2x + y + 2 = 0. So in standard form, that's -2x + y + 2 = 0. Therefore, A is -2, B is 1, and C is 2. Plugging these into the distance formula: |A*x + B*y + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). So substituting the values, the numerator becomes |-2*6 + 1*0 + 2| which is |-12 + 0 + 2| = |-10| = 10. The denominator is sqrt((-2)² + 1²) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). Therefore, the distance should be 10 / sqrt(5). But wait, they want the answer in the simplest radical form. So I need to rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (10*sqrt(5)) / (sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)) = (10*sqrt(5))/5 = 2*sqrt(5). So the distance is 2√5.\n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can use geometry instead of the formula. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So if I can find the equation of the line perpendicular to y = 2x - 2 that passes through (6, 0), then find the intersection point of these two lines, and then compute the distance between (6, 0) and that intersection point, that should give the same result.\n\nAlright, the original line has a slope of 2. Therefore, the perpendicular line will have a slope of -1/2. So the equation of the perpendicular line passing through (6, 0) is y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6), which simplifies to y = (-1/2)x + 3. Now, find where this line intersects the original line y = 2x - 2.\n\nSet the two equations equal: (-1/2)x + 3 = 2x - 2. Let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: -x + 6 = 4x - 4. Bring all terms to one side: -x -4x + 6 +4 = 0 => -5x +10 = 0 => -5x = -10 => x = 2. Then plug x = 2 into one of the equations, say y = 2x - 2: y = 4 - 2 = 2. So the intersection point is (2, 2). Now, compute the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2). Using the distance formula: sqrt[(6 - 2)^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = sqrt[16 + 4] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5). That matches the previous result. So both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can visualize this. The line y = 2x - 2 is a straight line with a slope of 2, and the point (6, 0) is somewhere to the left of the line. The shortest distance should be along the perpendicular. Since the algebra checks out, I think 2√5 is correct. I can't think of any mistakes here. Let me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Convert the line equation to standard form: -2x + y + 2 = 0.\n2. Apply the distance formula: |A*x₀ + B*y₀ + C| / sqrt(A² + B²).\n3. Plug in the values: |-12 + 0 + 2| / sqrt(4 + 1) = 10 / sqrt(5) = 2√5.\n4. Alternatively, find the perpendicular line, find the intersection, compute distance, which also gives 2√5.\n5. Both methods confirm the same answer.\n\nSo yeah, I think that's solid. The answer should be 2√5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe shortest distance is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the point \\((6, 0)\\) to the line \\(y = 2x - 2\\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.

The roots are α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, and they are distinct. The set we need to determine is {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. \n\nFirst, I remember that for a quartic equation, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Maybe I can use those here. Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0. Then:\n\n- Sum of roots: α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a\n- Sum of products of roots two at a time: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b\n- Sum of products three at a time: α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c\n- Product of all roots: α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d\n\nIn our given equation, x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, so comparing to the general form:\n\n- a = 2, so sum of roots is -a = -2\n- b = 0 (since there's no x² term), so sum of products two at a time is 0\n- c = 0 (since there's no x term), so sum of products three at a time is -c = 0\n- d = 2, so product of all roots is 2\n\nWait, but in our case, the equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Let me check again:\n\nYes, coefficients are:\n\n- x⁴ term: 1\n- x³ term: 2\n- x² term: 0\n- x term: 0\n- constant term: 2\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formulas give:\n\n1. α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2\n2. α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0\n3. α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0\n4. α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2\n\nBut the problem is asking for the set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. Let's denote these three expressions as S1, S2, S3:\n\nS₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄\n\nS₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄\n\nS₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃\n\nI need to find the set {S₁, S₂, S₃}. \n\nGiven that the sum of all possible pairs (S₁ + S₂ + S₃) would be:\n\n(α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0 (from Vieta's second formula). So S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three elements in the set is 0. So if I can find two of them, the third can be found by subtracting their sum from 0. But how do I find each individual S₁, S₂, S₃?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some symmetry or relation between these expressions. Let me think. If I consider the roots in pairs, perhaps. The polynomial is quartic, so maybe it factors into quadratics.\n\nWait, the given polynomial is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2. Let me try to factor it. Maybe it factors into two quadratics with real coefficients? Let's see.\n\nSuppose x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d). Let's multiply out the right-hand side:\n\n= x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (b + d + a c)x² + (a d + b c)x + b d\n\nComparing coefficients with x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2:\n\n1. Coefficient of x⁴: 1 = 1 (okay)\n2. Coefficient of x³: a + c = 2\n3. Coefficient of x²: b + d + a c = 0\n4. Coefficient of x: a d + b c = 0\n5. Constant term: b d = 2\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n1. a + c = 2\n2. b + d + a c = 0\n3. a d + b c = 0\n4. b d = 2\n\nWe need to solve for a, b, c, d. Let's see. Let me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 1: c = 2 - a\n\nFrom equation 4: b d = 2, so d = 2 / b\n\nLet me substitute c = 2 - a and d = 2 / b into equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2: b + (2 / b) + a(2 - a) = 0\n\nEquation 3: a*(2 / b) + b*(2 - a) = 0\n\nSo equation 2 becomes: b + 2/b + 2a - a² = 0\n\nEquation 3 becomes: (2a)/b + 2b - a b = 0\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me see if I can find real numbers a, b that satisfy these equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try integer values for b and d first, since their product is 2. Possible pairs (b, d) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1). Let's test these.\n\nFirst, try b = 1, d = 2:\n\nThen equation 2: 1 + 2 + a(2 - a) = 0 → 3 + 2a - a² = 0 → a² - 2a - 3 = 0 → a = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2 → a = 3 or a = -1\n\nCheck equation 3: (2a)/1 + 1*(2 - a) = 2a + 2 - a = a + 2 = 0 → a = -2\n\nBut from equation 2, a is either 3 or -1, which conflicts with a = -2. So this doesn't work.\n\nNext, try b = 2, d = 1:\n\nEquation 2: 2 + 1 + a(2 - a) = 0 → 3 + 2a - a² = 0 → same as above, a² - 2a - 3 = 0 → a = 3 or -1\n\nEquation 3: (2a)/2 + 2*(2 - a) = a + 4 - 2a = -a + 4 = 0 → a = 4\n\nAgain, conflict with a = 3 or -1. Doesn't work.\n\nNext, try b = -1, d = -2:\n\nEquation 2: -1 + (-2) + a(2 - a) = -3 + 2a - a² = 0 → a² - 2a + 3 = 0 → discriminant 4 - 12 = -8 < 0. No real solutions. Disregard.\n\nNext, b = -2, d = -1:\n\nEquation 2: -2 + (-1) + a(2 - a) = -3 + 2a - a² = 0 → same as above, a² - 2a + 3 = 0 → no real solutions.\n\nSo factoring into quadratics with integer coefficients doesn't work. Maybe the polynomial doesn't factor over the reals? Let me check if it has real roots.\n\nPlotting the function f(x) = x⁴ + 2x³ + 2. Let's see:\n\nFor x approaching +infty, f(x) approaches +infty.\n\nAt x = 0: f(0) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 > 0\n\nAt x = -1: (-1)^4 + 2*(-1)^3 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 > 0\n\nAt x = -2: 16 + 2*(-8) + 2 = 16 - 16 + 2 = 2 > 0\n\nAt x = -3: 81 + 2*(-27) + 2 = 81 - 54 + 2 = 31 > 0\n\nSo f(x) is always positive for real x, meaning there are no real roots. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the reals, and its roots are complex. Since the coefficients are real, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs.\n\nSo the four roots are two conjugate pairs. Let's denote them as a + bi, a - bi, c + di, c - di. But since the coefficients are real, that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use substitution or polar form. Let me consider writing the equation in polar coordinates. Let me set x = r e^{iθ}, then x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe substitute y = x + a to eliminate the cubic term, but since the equation is already x⁴ + 2x³ + 2, maybe that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Let me write x⁴ = -2x³ - 2. Maybe factor out x³? But x⁴ = x * x³, so x³(x + 2) = -2. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the substitution z = x + 1. Let's see:\n\nx = z - 1. Then x³ = (z - 1)^3 = z³ - 3z² + 3z - 1\n\nx⁴ = (z - 1)^4 = z⁴ - 4z³ + 6z² - 4z + 1\n\nThen substituting into the original equation:\n\nx⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (z⁴ - 4z³ + 6z² - 4z + 1) + 2(z³ - 3z² + 3z - 1) + 2 = z⁴ - 4z³ + 6z² - 4z + 1 + 2z³ - 6z² + 6z - 2 + 2 = z⁴ - 2z³ + 0z² + 2z + 1 = 0\n\nSo the equation becomes z⁴ - 2z³ + 2z + 1 = 0. Hmm, maybe that's easier to factor? Not sure. Let's check if z=1 is a root:\n\n1 - 2 + 2 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0. z= -1: 1 + 2 - 2 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0. z=0: 0 - 0 + 0 + 1 =1 ≠0. So no rational roots. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation can be factored into quadratics. Let's try:\n\nz⁴ - 2z³ + 2z + 1 = (z² + a z + b)(z² + c z + d)\n\nMultiply out:\n\n= z⁴ + (a + c)z³ + (b + d + a c)z² + (a d + b c)z + b d\n\nCompare coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of z⁴: 1 (okay)\n2. Coefficient of z³: a + c = -2\n3. Coefficient of z²: b + d + a c = 0\n4. Coefficient of z: a d + b c = 2\n5. Constant term: b d = 1\n\nSo similar to before. Let's see if we can solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 5: b d =1. So possible real solutions: b=1, d=1 or b=-1, d=-1.\n\nTry b=1, d=1:\n\nEquation 2: a + c = -2\n\nEquation 3: 1 + 1 + a c = 0 → a c = -2\n\nEquation 4: a*1 + 1*c = a + c = -2 (from equation 2). But equation 4 requires a + c = 2. Contradiction. Not possible.\n\nTry b=-1, d=-1:\n\nEquation 5: (-1)(-1)=1, okay.\n\nEquation 2: a + c = -2\n\nEquation 3: -1 + (-1) + a c = -2 + a c = 0 → a c = 2\n\nEquation 4: a*(-1) + (-1)*c = -a - c = 2 → a + c = -2. Which matches equation 2. So from equation 2 and 4, we have a + c = -2 and a + c = -2. So the equations are consistent. So from a + c = -2 and a c = 2.\n\nSo we have a and c as roots of the quadratic equation t² + 2t + 2 = 0. Wait, discriminant 4 - 8 = -4 < 0. So complex solutions. Thus, a and c are complex conjugates: a = -1 + i, c = -1 - i, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the factorization is (z² + (-1 + i)z -1)(z² + (-1 -i)z -1). Let", "answer": "\\{1\\pm\\sqrt{5},-2\\}"}

En centimes, quel est le coût d'un crayon ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the cost of a regular crayon. They mention that three regular crayons and one jumbo eraser cost $1.24. Then, five regular crayons and one jumbo eraser cost $1.82. Both cases don't include tax, and we need to find the price of a crayon in cents. Hmm, so we need to set up equations here, right?\n\nLet me start by defining variables. Let's say the price of one regular crayon is C dollars, and the price of the jumbo eraser is E dollars. The problem mentions cents, but since the total amounts are given in dollars, maybe I should convert everything to cents to avoid decimals. Wait, the question asks for the answer in cents, so maybe solving in dollars first and then converting to cents is okay. Let me think.\n\nBut actually, if I convert dollars to cents now, the numbers might be easier. For example, $1.24 is 124 cents, and $1.82 is 182 cents. That way, all the numbers are whole numbers, which might make calculations simpler without having to deal with decimals. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, translating the problem into cents:\n\n- 3 crayons + 1 eraser = 124 cents\n- 5 crayons + 1 eraser = 182 cents\n\nWe need to find the price of one crayon in cents. Let's write the equations:\n\n3C + E = 124  \n5C + E = 182\n\nNow, since both equations have E, maybe we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate E. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(5C + E) - (3C + E) = 182 - 124  \n5C + E - 3C - E = 58  \n2C = 58\n\nSo, 2C = 58 cents. Therefore, C = 58 / 2 = 29 cents. Hmm, so a regular crayon is 29 cents? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf one crayon is 29 cents, then 3 crayons would be 87 cents. Then, the eraser would be 124 - 87 = 37 cents. Let's check the second equation: 5 crayons would be 5 * 29 = 145 cents. Adding the eraser's 37 cents gives 145 + 37 = 182 cents, which matches the second total. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the price of a crayon is 29 cents. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. By subtracting the two equations, I eliminated E and found the difference in cost between 2 crayons, leading to 58 cents. Dividing by 2 gives the price per crayon. Then verifying with the original equations shows that the numbers check out. Yeah, that seems solid.\n\nI think that's the answer. 29 cents per crayon.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cost of a crayon is \\boxed{29} cents.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( C \\) be the price of one regular crayon in cents and \\( E \\) be the price of the jumbo eraser in cents. We are given the following equations based on the problem statement:\n\n\\[\n3C + E = 124\n\\]\n\\[\n5C + E = 182\n\\]\n\nTo find the price of a crayon, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(5C + E) - (3C + E) = 182 - 124\n\\]\n\\[\n2C = 58\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{58}{2} = 29\n\\]\n\nWe verify the solution by checking the values in the original equations.

The problem is asking for the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 137 divided by 500. Hmm, so I need to compute 137/500 and then look at its decimal form, identify the last digit before it terminates or starts repeating, but specifically the last non-zero one. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should just do the division directly. Let's see, 137 divided by 500. Let me convert that into a decimal. Since 500 is 5 times 100, which is 5*10^2. So 137 divided by 500 is the same as 137 divided by 5 divided by 100. Let me compute 137 divided by 5 first. 137 divided by 5 is 27.4. Then divide that by 100, which moves the decimal point two places to the left, so 0.274. So the decimal expansion is 0.274. Therefore, the digits after the decimal are 2, 7, and 4. Since it terminates after three decimal places, the last non-zero digit is 4. Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. 137 divided by 500. Let me do the division step by step. 500 goes into 137 zero times. So we write 0. Then we consider 1370 divided by 500. 500 goes into 1370 two times (since 2*500=1000), subtract 1000 from 1370, we get 370. Bring down a zero: 3700. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (7*500=3500), subtract 3500 from 3700, get 200. Bring down a zero: 2000. 500 goes into 2000 four times exactly. So that gives 0.274. So yes, the decimal terminates at three digits: 0.274. Therefore, the digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4. All non-zero. So the last non-zero digit is 4. Wait, but maybe the problem is trickier? Maybe the decimal doesn't terminate? Wait, 500 is 2^2 * 5^3. So the denominator in the reduced fraction would have factors of 2 and 5. The numerator is 137, which is a prime number, I think. 137 divided by 500, since 137 is prime and doesn't share factors with 500 except 1, so the fraction is already in simplest terms. Therefore, the denominator is 2^2 * 5^3. So when converting to a decimal, the number of decimal places is determined by the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator. Here, exponent of 2 is 2, exponent of 5 is 3. So maximum is 3. Therefore, the decimal terminates after 3 digits. So yes, 0.274. So the digits are 2, 7, 4. All non-zero. So the last non-zero digit is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4. Hmm, seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify by another method. Let me compute 137 divided by 500. Let's use fractions. 137/500. Let me convert that to a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. 500*2=1000, so 137*2=274. So 274/1000=0.274. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting something else. Wait, sometimes problems like this might have a repeating decimal, but in this case, since the denominator is 500, which is 2^2*5^3, the decimal terminates. So there's no repeating part. Therefore, all the digits after the decimal are non-repeating and terminate at three digits. Therefore, the last non-zero digit is indeed 4. So I think the answer is 4. But let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if 137/500 can be simplified. 137 is a prime number. Let me confirm. 137 divided by 2 is 68.5, not integer. Divided by 3: 137/3≈45.666, not integer. 5? Ends with 7, so no. 7? 7*19=133, 137-133=4, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*12=132, 137-132=5, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*10=130, 137-130=7, not divisible by 13. So 137 is a prime. Therefore, 137/500 is indeed in simplest terms. Therefore, the decimal expansion must terminate. So 0.274. Therefore, the last non-zero digit is 4. So I think that's the answer. Maybe the problem is straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't overlook anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in French, since the original problem is in French: \"Quel est le dernier chiffre non nul à droite du point decimal dans leacobien셜join the development decimal de 137/500?\" So \"non nul\" is \"non-zero\", \" à droite\" is \"to the right of the decimal point\", \"le point decimal\" is \"the decimal point\", \"le developsment decimal\" is \"the decimal expansion\". So yeah, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 137/500. So 0.274. The digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4. All non-zero. So the last one is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm by actually performing the division step by step.\n\nDividing 137 by 500:\n\n500 goes into 137 zero times. Add a decimal point, then multiply 137 by 10, getting 1370. 500 goes into 1370 two times (2*500=1000), subtract 1000 from 1370, remainder 370. Bring down a 0, making 3700. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (7*500=3500), subtract 3500 from 3700, remainder 200. Bring down a 0, making 2000. 500 goes into 2000 four times (4*500=2000), subtract to get 0. So the decimal terminates at three digits: 0.274. So yes, the digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4. All non-zero, so the last one is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the final answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{137}{500}\\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.\n\n1. **Convert the fraction**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{137}{500}\n   \\]\n   Since 500 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^3\\), the decimal expansion will terminate because the denominator has only factors of 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to make the denominator a power of 10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{137 \\times 2}{500 \\times 2} = \\frac{274}{1000} = 0.274\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify the decimal expansion**:\n   Performing the division step-by-step:\n   - 500 goes into 1370 two times (2*500=1000), remainder 370.\n   - Bring down a 0 to make 3700. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (7*500=3500), remainder 200.\n   - Bring down a 0 to make 2000. 500 goes into 2000 four times (4*500=2000), remainder 0.\n\n   The decimal expansion terminates at three digits: 0.274.\n\n4. **Identify the last non-zero digit**:\n   The digits after the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4.

The question is about finding the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle ABCD is closer to the center O than to any of the four vertices. The rectangle has sides AB and AD with a ratio k, so AB/AD = k. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the rectangle. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle with center O. The coordinates given are from (-250,100) to (250,100) vertically and (-250,-100) to (250,-100) horizontally. So, the rectangle is centered at the origin (0,0), which is point O. The length AB is 500 units (from -250 to 250 on the x-axis), and AD is 200 units (from 100 to -100 on the y-axis). Therefore, the ratio AB/AD = 500/200 = 5/2 = k. So, k is 5/2. \n\nWait, the problem states AB/AD = k, so if AB is the horizontal side and AD is the vertical side, then the rectangle has length AB = 500 and width AD = 200, making k = 5/2. That’s important because the ratio will affect the shape of the regions where points are closer to the center or to the vertices.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that a random point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. To find this probability, we need to determine the area within the rectangle where all points are closer to O than to any vertex, divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the regions within the rectangle where a point is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D.\n2. Compute the area of this region.\n3. Divide by the total area of the rectangle to get the probability.\n\nTo find the regions where a point is closer to O than to any vertex, we can use the concept of Voronoi diagrams. Each vertex and the center O are sites for which we need to determine the Voronoi regions. However, since the center is inside the rectangle, the Voronoi region around O would be bounded by perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. \n\nAlternatively, for each vertex, the set of points closer to O than to that vertex forms a region bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments connecting O to each vertex. The intersection of all these regions (closer to O than to any vertex) would be the desired area.\n\nLet me formalize this. For any point P inside the rectangle, the condition that P is closer to O than to vertex A can be written as:\n\nDistance from P to O < Distance from P to A.\n\nSimilarly, the same condition must hold for distances to B, C, and D.\n\nSo, we need to find the set of points P such that:\n\nd(P, O) < d(P, A),\nd(P, O) < d(P, B),\nd(P, O) < d(P, C),\nd(P, O) < d(P, D).\n\nEach of these inequalities defines a region, and the intersection of all these regions is the set of points closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nTo find these regions, let's consider each inequality one by one.\n\nFirst, let's handle the inequality d(P, O) < d(P, A). \n\nLet’s denote the coordinates. Let’s place the rectangle in a coordinate system with O at (0,0). Let’s let AB be the horizontal side and AD be the vertical side. So, point A is at (-a, b), B at (a, b), C at (a, -b), D at (-a, -b), where 2a is the length AB and 2b is the length AD. Therefore, AB = 2a, AD = 2b, so the ratio k = AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. Hence, a = k*b.\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, the rectangle has AB = 500 (from -250 to 250 on the x-axis) and AD = 200 (from 100 to -100 on the y-axis). So, AB = 500, AD = 200, so k = AB/AD = 500/200 = 2.5, which is 5/2. So, a = 250, b = 100. Then a/b = 250/100 = 2.5 = 5/2. So, that's consistent. So, in general, a = (k/2) * AD, but since AB = k*AD, then AB = 2a = k*AD, so a = (k/2)*AD. But since AD is 2b, then a = (k/2)*(2b) = k*b. So, a = k*b. Therefore, coordinates are A(-k*b, b), B(k*b, b), C(k*b, -b), D(-k*b, -b).\n\nTherefore, the rectangle has length AB = 2k*b and width AD = 2b. So, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = 2k*b * 2b = 4k*b². The center O is at (0,0). The vertices are at (±k*b, ±b).\n\nNow, let's find the region where a point P(x, y) is closer to O than to A. The condition is sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + k*b)^2 + (y - b)^2). Squaring both sides to remove the square roots:\n\nx² + y² < (x + k*b)^2 + (y - b)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(x + k*b)^2 + (y - b)^2 = x² + 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + y² - 2b*y + b².\n\nSubtracting x² + y² from both sides:\n\n0 < 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 - 2b*y + b².\n\nSimplify:\n\n2k*b*x - 2b*y + (k*b)^2 + b² > 0.\n\nFactor out 2b from the first two terms:\n\n2b(k*x - y) + b²(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nDivide both sides by b (since b > 0):\n\n2(k*x - y) + b(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nSo, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n2k*x - 2y + b(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nk*x - y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nSo, the region where P is closer to O than to A is defined by the inequality k*x - y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nSimilarly, we need to find the regions where P is closer to O than to B, C, and D. Let's handle each vertex one by one.\n\nFirst, closer to O than to A: k*x - y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nCloser to O than to B: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - k*b)^2 + (y - b)^2).\n\nFollowing similar steps:\n\nx² + y² < (x - k*b)^2 + (y - b)^2.\n\nExpanding the RHS:\n\nx² - 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + y² - 2b*y + b².\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < -2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 - 2b*y + b².\n\nFactor:\n\n-2k*b*x -2b*y + b²(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nDivide by -2b (inequality flips):\n\nk*x + y - (b(k² + 1))/2 < 0.\n\nSo, the region closer to O than to B is k*x + y - (b(k² + 1))/2 < 0.\n\nSimilarly, for vertex C: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - k*b)^2 + (y + b)^2).\n\nFollowing the same method:\n\nx² + y² < (x - k*b)^2 + (y + b)^2.\n\nExpanding RHS:\n\nx² - 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + y² + 2b*y + b².\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < -2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + 2b*y + b².\n\nFactor:\n\n-2k*b*x + 2b*y + b²(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nDivide by 2b:\n\n- k*x + y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nSo, the region closer to O than to C is -k*x + y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nFinally, closer to O than to D: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + k*b)^2 + (y + b)^2).\n\nFollowing the same steps:\n\nx² + y² < (x + k*b)^2 + (y + b)^2.\n\nExpanding RHS:\n\nx² + 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + y² + 2b*y + b².\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < 2k*b*x + (k*b)^2 + 2b*y + b².\n\nFactor:\n\n2k*b*x + 2b*y + b²(k² + 1) > 0.\n\nDivide by 2b:\n\nk*x + y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nSo, the region closer to O than to D is k*x + y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0.\n\nTherefore, the four inequalities defining the region where P is closer to O than to any vertex are:\n\n1. k*x - y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0 (closer to O than to A)\n2. k*x + y - (b(k² + 1))/2 < 0 (closer to O than to B)\n3. -k*x + y + (b(k² + 1))/2 > 0 (closer to O than to C)\n4. -k*x - y - (b(k² + 1))/2 < 0 (closer to O than to D)\n\nThese four inequalities define a region bounded by four lines. Let's write them more neatly:\n\n1. k*x - y > - (b(k² + 1))/2\n2. k*x + y < (b(k² + 1))/2\n3. -k*x + y > - (b(k² + 1))/2\n4. -k*x - y < (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nAlternatively, these can be rewritten as:\n\n1. y < k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n2. y < -k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n3. y > k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n4. y > -k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nThese inequalities describe the region bounded by four lines, forming a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the center O. The four lines are the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. So, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions defined by these inequalities, which is a diamond-shaped region around the center.\n\nTherefore, the desired area is the area of this diamond within the rectangle.\n\nTo find the area of this diamond, we can note that the diamond is a convex polygon with four edges, each of which is the intersection of two of the bisectors. The vertices of the diamond are the intersection points of the four lines.\n\nLet me find the equations of the lines:\n\n1. y = k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n2. y = -k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n3. y = k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n4. y = -k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nThe intersection points of these lines will form the vertices of the diamond. Let's find these intersection points.\n\nFirst, find the intersection of lines 1 and 2:\n\nSolve:\n\nk*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 = -k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nAdding k*x to both sides:\n\n2k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 = (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nSubtract (b(k² + 1))/2 from both sides:\n\n2k*x = 0 => x = 0\n\nSubstitute x = 0 into line 1:\n\ny = 0 + (b(k² + 1))/2 => y = (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nSo, intersection point is (0, (b(k² + 1))/2)\n\nSimilarly, intersection of lines 2 and 3:\n\nSolve:\n\n-k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 = k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 - k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2k*x + b(k² + 1) = 0\n\n=> -2k*x = -b(k² + 1)\n\n=> x = [b(k² + 1)]/(2k)\n\nSubstitute x into line 2:\n\ny = -k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2\n\n= -k*(b(k² + 1)/(2k)) + (b(k² + 1))/2\n\n= -b(k² + 1)/2 + b(k² + 1)/2\n\n= 0\n\nSo, intersection point is ( [b(k² + 1)]/(2k), 0 )\n\nSimilarly, intersection of lines 3 and 4:\n\nSolve:\n\nk*x - (b(k² + 1))/2 = -k*x - (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nk*x - (b(k² + 1))/2 + k*x + (b(k² + 1))/2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2k*x = 0 => x = 0\n\nSubstitute x = 0 into line 3:\n\ny = 0 - (b(k² + 1))/2 => y = - (b(k² + 1))/2\n\nSo, intersection point is (0, - (b(k² + 1))/2 )\n\nIntersection of lines 4 and 1:\n\nSolve:\n\n-k*x -", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}

Hmm, let's think. When we say \"54 mod 6,\" we're looking for how many times 6 fits into 54 and then whatever is left over. Right?\n\nFirst, maybe I can try dividing 54 by 6. Let me do that. 6 times 9 is 54 because 6 times 10 is 60, which is too big. So 6*9=54. Wait, that means there's no remainder because 6 divides 54 exactly. So the remainder should be zero. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of multiples of 6. The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and so on. So 6*9=54. Yep, so 54 is a multiple of 6, so when you divide 54 by 6, there's no remainder. Therefore, the remainder is zero. \n\nI guess another way to check is to subtract the largest multiple of 6 less than 54. But since 54 itself is a multiple, that's 54. So subtracting 54 - 54 gives 0. So the remainder is 0. \n\nWait, is there any other way to approach this? Maybe using division algorithm which says that for any integers a and b (b>0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r and 0 ≤ r < b. Here, a is 54, b is 6. So we need to find q and r. \n\nSo 54 divided by 6 is 9 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, q is 9 and r is 0. So the remainder is 0. \n\nYeah, that all checks out. I think that's solid.

The function f(n) is defined piecewise: it's the floor of n when n is greater than or equal to 4, and the ceiling of n when n is less than 4. We need to find f(π/3), f(√45), and f(8^(2/3)), then add those three results together.\n\nFirst, let me recall what floor and ceiling functions do. The floor function, denoted by ⎣n⎦, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to n. The ceiling function, denoted by ⎡n⎤, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to n. So, for example, floor(3.2) is 3, and ceiling(3.2) is 4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each term one by one.\n\nStarting with f(π/3). π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 is about 1.0472. Now, we need to check if π/3 is less than 4 or not. Since 1.0472 is definitely less than 4, we use the ceiling function here. Therefore, f(π/3) = ⎡π/3⎤. Let's compute that. π is about 3.1416, so π/3 ≈ 1.0472. The ceiling of 1.0472 is 2 because 1.0472 is between 1 and 2, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is 2. So, f(π/3) = 2.\n\nNext, f(√45). Let's calculate √45. 45 is 9 times 5, so √45 = √(9*5) = 3√5. √5 is approximately 2.236, so 3*2.236 ≈ 6.708. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, √45 is between √36 and √49, which are 6 and 7. Let me check: 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49. 45 is between 36 and 49, so √45 is between 6 and 7. To get a more accurate value, 6.7^2 = 44.89, which is close to 45. So √45 ≈ 6.708. Therefore, √45 ≈ 6.708. Now, check if this is greater than or equal to 4. Yes, 6.708 is way greater than 4, so we use the floor function here. Therefore, f(√45) = ⎣6.708⎦. The floor of 6.708 is 6 because 6 is the greatest integer less than or equal to 6.708. So, f(√45) = 6.\n\nThird term is f(8^(2/3)). Let's compute 8^(2/3). 8 is 2^3, so 8^(2/3) = (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2^2 = 4. Wait, is that right? Let me verify. Alternatively, 8^(1/3) is the cube root of 8, which is 2. Then 2 squared is 4. Yes, so 8^(2/3) = 4. Therefore, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4. Now, check if this is greater than or equal to 4. Yes, it's exactly 4. Therefore, we use the floor function here. So, f(8^(2/3)) = ⎣4⎦. The floor of 4 is 4 itself. So, f(8^(2/3)) = 4.\n\nNow, adding up the three results: f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)) = 2 + 6 + 4. Let's compute that. 2 + 6 is 8, and 8 + 4 is 12. So, the total sum is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, f(π/3): π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 ≈ 1.047. Since this is less than 4, ceiling it gives 2. That's correct.\n\nSecond, f(√45): √45 is approximately 6.708, which is greater than 4, so floor it to 6. Correct.\n\nThird, f(8^(2/3)): 8^(2/3) = (8^(1/3))^2 = 2^2 = 4. Exactly 4, so floor of 4 is 4. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 12. I think that's it. Let me just check if the function f(n) was defined correctly. The problem states that if n >= 4, use floor; if n < 4, use ceiling. So, for numbers less than 4, ceiling applies, and for numbers 4 or above, floor applies. In our case, the three inputs: π/3 ≈1.047 <4, so ceiling; √45 ≈6.708 >=4, so floor; 8^(2/3)=4 >=4, so floor.

Combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il après qu'elles aient converti autant de pièces en billets qu'elles le pouvaient ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about four girls—Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie—who sold cookies and earned a certain amount of money. After selling, they combined all their money and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. The question is asking how many cents of money would remain after they converted as many coins as possible into bills. So, basically, if they have some coins left over after exchanging as many as they can into dollar bills, how much is that remainder in cents?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount of money they earned altogether. Each girl has a different amount, so I should add them up. Let me write down each amount:\n\nLinda: $27.47  \nSherry: $35.23  \nJune: $37.37  \nConnie: $26.52  \n\nAdding these together. Let me do this step by step. Maybe start by adding Linda and Sherry first.\n\n27.47 + 35.23. Let's see, 27 + 35 is 62, and 0.47 + 0.23 is 0.70. So that's $62.70.\n\nNext, add June's $37.37 to that. So 62.70 + 37.37. 62 + 37 is 99, and 0.70 + 0.37 is 1.07. So 99 + 1.07 is 100.07. So altogether now it's $100.07.\n\nThen add Connie's $26.52. So 100.07 + 26.52. 100 + 26 is 126, and 0.07 + 0.52 is 0.59. So total is $126.59.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in adding. Let's do it piece by piece:\n\n27.47  \n+35.23  \n+37.37  \n+26.52  \n\nAdding the dollars first: 27 + 35 + 37 + 26. Let's compute that.\n\n27 + 35 is 62. 62 + 37 is 99. 99 + 26 is 125. So total dollars are 125.\n\nNow the cents: 0.47 + 0.23 + 0.37 + 0.52.\n\n0.47 + 0.23 is 0.70. 0.70 + 0.37 is 1.07. 1.07 + 0.52 is 1.59. So total cents are 1.59, which is $1.59.\n\nTherefore, total money is $125 + $1.59 = $126.59. Okay, that matches my previous total. So the combined total is $126.59.\n\nNow, they want to convert as many of these pieces into bills as possible. So, in other words, how much can they exchange into $1 bills, and what's left over in coins. The remainder would be the amount left in cents.\n\nSo, if they have $126.59, then converting as many as possible into $1 bills would mean they can make 126 bills of $1 each, and the remaining amount is $0.59. Since the question asks for the remainder in cents, that would be 59 cents.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says \" combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il₀ After converting as many coins as possible into bills.\" So, if they have coins, they exchange as many as possible into bills (which are $1 each), so the leftover is in coins. But in the total amount, $126.59, the 0.59 is already in cents. So 59 cents would be the remainder.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's think of it as total cents. If they have $126.59, that's 126 dollars and 59 cents. To convert into bills, they can exchange 126 dollars into 126 bills, and the remaining 59 cents are left as coins. Therefore, the remainder is 59 cents.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the entire amount in cents: $126.59 is 126*100 + 59 = 12659 cents. When converting into bills, each bill is 100 cents, so the number of bills is 12659 divided by 100. The quotient is 126 with a remainder of 59. So the remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the amounts. Let's verify the total again.\n\nLinda: $27.47  \nSherry: $35.23  \nJune: $37.37  \nConnie: $26.52  \n\nAdding step by step:\n\n27.47 + 35.23:  \n27 + 35 = 62  \n0.47 + 0.23 = 0.70  \nTotal: 62.70\n\n62.70 + 37.37:  \n62 + 37 = 99  \n0.70 + 0.37 = 1.07  \nTotal: 99 + 1.07 = 100.07\n\n100.07 + 26.52:  \n100 + 26 = 126  \n0.07 + 0.52 = 0.59  \nTotal: 126.59\n\nYes, that's correct. So total is $126.59, which is 12659 cents.\n\nDivided by 100 cents per dollar: 12659 / 100 = 126.59 dollars. So they can get 126 dollar bills, and 59 cents remaining.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 59 cents.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"after they had converted the amount of their money into dollars.\" Wait, does that mean converting all the money into dollars, but considering that they have coins and bills? Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"after the sale, they put their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. Combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il₀ After that conversion, how much money (in cents) was left.\"\n\nWait, maybe they first have a combination of coins and bills, and they convert as many coins as possible into bills, so the remainder is the leftover cents. But the problem says \"convert their money into dollars\", so perhaps they are converting all their money into dollars, but the question is how much is left after converting as many as possible into dollar bills. So the remainder is the cents part, which is 59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in French, and \"convertir les pieces en dollars\" might mean converting the coins into dollars, so that they can give the bank the bills, and the coins are kept. Wait, but the translation is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"After the sale, they put their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. Combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il₀ Combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il₀\"\n\nSo, they first put their money together (total amount) and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. So, perhaps they first have some coins and some bills, and they convert the coins into dollars (so exchanging coins for dollar bills), and the question is how much is left in cents. But the total amount is $126.59. If they convert the coins into dollars, how much is left?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that they have a total of $126.59, which includes some coins and some bills. They want to convert the coins into dollars, so that the total amount in dollars is increased by converting those coins into dollars. But since they are going to the bank to convert the coins into dollars, perhaps they are exchanging the coins for dollar bills, thereby increasing the number of dollar bills, but the total amount in dollars would be the same as before, but represented as more dollar bills and less coins. Wait, but the problem says \"combien d'argent, en centimes, restait-il₀\" which translates to \"how much money, in cents, was left\". So if they convert the coins into dollars, the amount left would be the coins that couldn't be converted. But if they convert all the coins into dollars, then there would be no coins left. Hmm, maybe the problem is in the translation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that they have some coins, and when they go to convert them into dollars, how much is left from the total amount. But the problem says \"after they had converted the amount of their money into dollars\". Wait, perhaps they have a total amount, which is in dollars, but some of it is in coins. Wait, but all their earnings are in dollars, right? Because they earned $27.47, which is dollars and cents. So when they combine all their earnings, the total is $126.59. So that is $126 dollars and 59 cents. So if they convert as many as possible into dollar bills, they can get 126 dollar bills, and 59 cents are left. So the answer is 59 cents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in French, and \"convertir les pieces into dollars\" means converting the coins into dollars, so they exchange the coins for dollars, so the remainder is the amount left in cents. So, if they have a certain number of coins, they can exchange those for dollars, but if they exchange as many as possible, the leftover would be the coins that couldn't be exchanged, which would be the cents part. Wait, but in the total amount, $126.59, the 0.59 is already in cents. So if they exchange the 59 cents into dollars, they can't, because a dollar is 100 cents. So the remainder is 59 cents. So the answer is 59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a mix of bills and coins. For example, each person's earnings might have some coins and some bills. But when they combine all their money, the total is $126.59. So when they go to the bank, they can exchange the 59 cents into smaller bills, but the problem says \"convert the coins into dollars\". Wait, maybe the problem is that they have coins (small bills) and they want to convert those coins into dollars (larger bills). So the total amount of money is $126.59, which is 126 dollars and 59 cents. The 59 cents are coins. So when they convert the coins into dollars, they can exchange 59 cents into, for example, 0 dollar bills and 59 cents remaining. So the remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that they have some coins that add up to a fraction of a dollar, so when they go to convert them into dollars, they can only get a certain number of dollar bills, and the remainder is the leftover cents. But in this case, the total amount is $126.59, so converting that into dollars would be 126 dollars and 59 cents. So the remainder is 59 cents. So the answer is 59.\n\nTherefore, after converting as many coins as possible into bills (i.e., exchanging 59 cents into, well, they can't exchange 59 cents into a dollar bill since that's 100 cents), so they can't convert any part of the 59 cents into a dollar bill, so the remainder is 59 cents. Hence, the answer is 59.\n\nBut let me confirm once again. Let's take a different approach. Suppose they have a total of $126.59. To convert this into dollars, you can have dollar bills and coins. The problem says they converted the coins into dollars. Wait, maybe they have coins that they want to convert into dollars, so that they can give the bank the bills and keep the coins. But if they convert the coins into dollars, how does that affect the total amount? Wait, converting coins into dollars doesn't change the total amount, it just changes the form. So if they have 59 cents in coins, converting that into dollars would mean they have 0 dollars and 59 cents, which is the same as before. So the total amount is still $126.59, but expressed as 126 dollars and 59 cents. Therefore, the remainder is 59 cents. So the answer is 59.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking how much money is left after converting the coins into bills, meaning exchanging as many coins as possible into dollar bills, then the remainder would be the amount of coins left. But since the total amount is $126.59, which is 126 dollars and 59 cents, the 59 cents are coins. So converting as many as possible into bills would mean converting 59 cents into, well, since a dollar is 100 cents, you can't convert 59 cents into a dollar. So the remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the remainder is 59 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount of money remaining is \\boxed{59} centimes.\n</think>\n\nLinda, Sherry, June, and Connie earned the following amounts by selling cookies: $27.47, $35.23, $37.37, and $26.52 respectively.

Si 20 élèves ont obtenu 80, 8 élèves ont obtenu 90, et 2 élèves ont obtenu 100, quelle était la moyenne de la classe (la moyenne) à ce test ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about calculating the average score of a class of 30 students. They gave specific scores: 20 students got 80, 8 got 90, and 2 got 100. Hmm, okay. So I need to find the mean here. Alright, the mean is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of students. That makes sense. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many students there are in total. The problem says there are 30 students. Let me check if the numbers add up: 20 + 8 + 2. Yeah, 20 plus 8 is 28, plus 2 is 30. So that's correct. So all 30 students are accounted for with their scores.\n\nNow, to find the total sum of all the scores. For that, I need to multiply the number of students who got each score by the score itself and then add them all together. Let's do that. \n\nStarting with the first group: 20 students got 80 each. So 20 multiplied by 80. Let me compute that. 20 times 80 is 1600. Okay, got that part.\n\nNext, 8 students got 90 each. So 8 times 90. Hmm, 8 times 90 is 720. Alright, so that's 720.\n\nThen, 2 students got 100 each. So 2 times 100 is 200. Got that.\n\nNow, add all those sums together. Let me add 1600 + 720 first. 1600 plus 720. Let's see, 1600 + 700 is 2300, and then +20 more is 2320. So that's 2320. Then add the remaining 200. 2320 + 200 is 2520. So the total sum of all the scores is 2520.\n\nNow, to find the average, I need to divide this total by the number of students, which is 30. So 2520 divided by 30. Let me compute that. Hmm, 30 goes into 2520 how many times? Well, 30 times 80 is 2400. Subtract 2400 from 2520, that leaves 120. Then 30 goes into 120 exactly 4 times. So 80 + 4 is 84. So 2520 divided by 30 is 84. Therefore, the average score of the class is 84.\n\nWait, let me verify that again to be sure. 30 times 84 is 2520. Yes, because 30 times 80 is 2400, plus 30 times 4 is 120, so 2400 + 120 is 2520. That matches the total sum. So that checks out. So the average is indeed 84.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break down the calculation differently. Let's see. Let's compute each part again step by step to confirm. \n\nFirst group: 20 students * 80 = 1600. Correct. Second group: 8 * 90 = 720. Third group: 2 * 100 = 200. Summing these: 1600 + 720 = 2320, then 2320 + 200 = 2520. Divided by 30: 2520 / 30. Let's divide 2520 by 10 first, which is 252, then divide by 3, which is 84. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using another method. Let's see. If I take the number of students and their scores as fractions of the total. For example, 20 out of 30 got 80, which is 2/3 of the class. 8 out of 30 is 4/15, and 2 out of 30 is 1/15. So 2/3 * 80 + 4/15 * 90 + 1/15 * 100. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 2/3 of 80: 80 divided by 3 is approximately 26.666..., multiplied by 2 is about 53.333...\n\nThen, 4/15 of 90: 90 divided by 15 is 6, multiplied by 4 is 24.\n\nThen, 1/15 of 100: 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666..., multiplied by 1 is about 6.666...\n\nAdding those together: 53.333... + 24 + 6.666... Let's see, 53.333 + 24 is 77.333..., plus 6.666 is 84. Exactly. So that method also gives 84. So that's a good confirmation.\n\nAnother way: Maybe compute the difference from the assumed average. Let's say someone assumed the average was 80. Then calculate the total error. But that might be more complicated. Let me try.\n\nIf the average is 80, then the total sum would be 30 * 80 = 2400. But the actual total sum is 2520, which is 120 more. So each student contributes an extra (2520 - 2400)/30 = 120/30 = 4. So the average is 80 + 4 = 84. Yep, that works too. So that's another method giving the same answer. So that's solid.\n\nSo all methods point to 84. Therefore, the average score of the class is 84. I think that's correct. No mistakes detected in the calculations. All steps check out. So the answer should be 84.\n</think>\n\nThe class consists of 30 students. To find the average score, calculate the total sum of all scores and divide by the number of students. \n\n- 20 students scored 80: \\(20 \\times 80 = 1600\\)\n- 8 students scored 90: \\(8 \\times 90 = 720\\)\n- 2 students scored 100: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n\nSumming these scores:  \n\\(1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\\)\n\nThe average is:  \n\\(\\frac{2520}{30} = 84\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{84}", "answer": "84"}

Let me remember what a magic square is. It's a grid where the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all equal. The problem gives me some numbers and some expressions with n, and I need to figure out what n is.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the square based on the Asymptote code. There's a 3x3 grid, right? The labels are given in the Asymptote code. Let me parse that.\n\nThe first row from left to right: n-3, 3, n+1.\n\nThe second row: n+2, 2n-9, 1.\n\nThe third row: 2, n, n-1.\n\nSo the magic square looks like this:\n\n| n-3 | 3  | n+1 |\n|-----|----|-----|\n| n+2 | 2n-9 | 1  |\n| 2  | n  | n-1 |\n\nAlright, so each row, column, and the two main diagonals should sum to the same value. Let me denote this common sum as S. So, I need to find n such that all these rows, columns, and diagonals add up to S.\n\nFirst, maybe I can find S by using a row or column that has all numbers expressed in terms of n. Let's check the second row: n+2, 2n-9, 1. If I add those up, that's (n+2) + (2n -9) + 1 = 3n -6. So, 3n -6 = S. That's one equation.\n\nAlternatively, the first row: (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n +1. So, 2n +1 = S. Hmm, so if both of these equal S, then 3n -6 = 2n +1. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if S is the same for all, then 3n -6 (from the second row) must equal 2n +1 (from the first row). Solving for n: 3n -6 = 2n +1 ⇒ n = 7. Let me verify this.\n\nBut before I get ahead of myself, let me check if this holds with other rows and columns. Let's suppose n=7. Then let's compute each cell:\n\nFirst row: 7-3 = 4, 3, 7+1=8. So 4, 3, 8. Sum is 15.\n\nSecond row: 7+2=9, 2*7 -9=14-9=5, 1. So 9,5,1. Sum is 15.\n\nThird row: 2, 7, 7-1=6. 2,7,6. Sum is 15.\n\nOkay, rows check out. Now check columns.\n\nFirst column: 4 (from first row), 9 (second row), 2 (third row). Sum is 15. Good.\n\nSecond column: 3,5,7. Sum is 15. Good.\n\nThird column: 8,1,6. Sum is 15. Good.\n\nNow check the diagonals.\n\nMain diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): 4,5,6. Sum is 15.\n\nOther diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): 8,5,2. Sum is 15. Perfect.\n\nSo n=7 seems to work. But wait, let me check if there's another way to get n. Maybe the problem is designed such that there might be another solution? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute S from another row or column. For example, the third row: 2, n, n-1. So sum is 2 + n + (n -1) = 2n +1. Which is the same as the first row's sum. So if that's equal to S, then S=2n +1. Then if S is also equal to the second row's sum, which is 3n -6, then 2n +1 = 3n -6 ⇒ n=7. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the first column: (n-3) + (n+2) + 2. Let's compute that: n -3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n +1. So that's S=2n +1. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, check the third column: (n+1) +1 + (n-1) = 2n +1. Same.\n\nSo all rows and columns give the same S=2n +1. So if S is also equal to the second row's sum, which is 3n -6, then 2n +1 =3n -6 ⇒ n=7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the main diagonal. Let's compute the main diagonal first cell: n-3, center cell:2n-9, third cell: n-1. So sum is (n-3) + (2n -9) + (n -1) = 4n -13. Since S=2n +1, set 4n -13 =2n +1 ⇒ 2n=14 ⇒n=7. Same result.\n\nOther diagonal: third cell of first row: n+1, center cell:2n -9, first cell of third row:2. So sum is (n+1) + (2n -9) +2 =3n -6. Again, set equal to S=2n +1: 3n -6=2n +1 ⇒n=7. Same answer.\n\nSo all equations lead to n=7. Therefore, the value of n is 7.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible solution. Let's suppose that maybe two different rows could give different sums? But in a magic square, all rows must have the same sum. So if even one row is inconsistent with the others, it's not a magic square. So if we compute S from one row, all other rows must sum to that. Since all equations lead to n=7, and when we plug in n=7, all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, which is consistent, then n=7 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if any of the given numbers conflict with n=7. For example, the center cell is 2n -9. If n=7, then 2*7 -9=14-9=5, which is present in the square. The third row third column is n-1=6, which is also present. The first row first column is n-3=4, which is present. All these numbers are valid. There's no division by n or anything, so n=7 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, after checking all possibilities and verifying the sums, n must be 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( n \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals is equal, we need to find the value of \\( n \\).\n\nThe magic square is structured as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nn-3 & 3 & n+1 \\\\\n\\hline\nn+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & n & n-1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal:\n\n1. **First row**: \\((n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1\\)\n2. **Second row**: \\((n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6\\)\n3. **Third row**: \\(2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1\\)\n\nSince the sums must be equal, we equate the expressions from the first and second rows:\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\implies n = 7\n\\]\n\nWe verify this value by checking other rows, columns, and diagonals:\n- **Second column**: \\(3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 15\\)\n- **Third column**: \\((n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (8) + 1 + 6 = 15\\)\n- **Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)**: \\((n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\\)\n- **Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)**: \\((n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15\\)\n\nAll sums confirm that the common sum \\( S \\) is 15 when \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nThus, the value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).", "answer": "7"}

Martha atteint le même endroit en marchant le long de sa longueur et de sa largeur. Le champ mesure 300 pieds de large et 400 pieds de long. Combien de pieds Jim marche-t-il de moins que Martha ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Jim and Martha who are sitting together at the corner of a rectangular field. Jim crosses the field diagonally, while Martha walks along the length and the width to reach the same spot. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. The question is asking how many fewer feet Jim walks compared to Martha.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out the distance each of them covers. Let's start with Martha. Since she walks along the length and the width, that should be straightforward. The field is 400 feet long and 300 feet wide. So if she walks the length and then the width, her total distance would be 400 + 300. Let me calculate that: 400 + 300 is 700 feet. So Martha walks 700 feet in total.\n\nNow, Jim is crossing the field diagonally. To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangle, I remember from geometry that you can use the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is sqrt(length² + width²). So plugging in the values here, the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the diagonal distance Jim walks is sqrt(400² + 300²).\n\nLet me compute that. First, square both numbers. 400 squared is 160,000, and 300 squared is 90,000. Adding those together gives 160,000 + 90,000 = 250,000. Then take the square root of 250,000. Hmm, sqrt(250,000). Well, sqrt(250,000) is the same as sqrt(25 * 10,000) which is 5 * 100 = 500. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 500 squared is 250,000, right? Let me check: 500*500 = 250,000. Yes, that's correct. So the diagonal is 500 feet.\n\nTherefore, Jim walks 500 feet. Martha walks 700 feet. The difference between them is 700 - 500 = 200 feet. So Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's verify the diagonal again. Using the Pythagorean theorem for a 300-400 foot rectangle. So 300 and 400 are the legs, hypotenuse squared is 300² + 400². Which is 90,000 + 160,000 = 250,000. Square root of 250,000 is indeed 500. So that's correct.\n\nMartha's path is 400 + 300 = 700. So 700 - 500 = 200. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 200 feet. Let me just think if there's another way this could be approached, maybe using vectors or something, but no, since it's a rectangle, the diagonal is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into adding instead of subtracting? But no, the question is how many fewer feet Jim walks than Martha, so it's Martha's distance minus Jim's. Which is 700 - 500 = 200. So I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in the logic here. The key was recognizing that Jim's path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 300 and 400, which gives 500, and Martha's path is the sum of the two sides, 700. The difference is 200. So yeah, the answer is 200 feet.\n</think>\n\nJim and Martha start at the same corner of a rectangular field measuring 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. Martha walks along the length and width, totaling \\(400 + 300 = 700\\) feet. Jim walks the diagonal, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \\sqrt{160,000 + 90,000} = \\sqrt{250,000} = 500 \\text{ feet}.\n\\]\n\nThe difference in their distances is \\(700 - 500 = 200\\) feet. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]", "answer": "200"}

The problem says: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. Find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). And we need to list all possible values separated by commas.\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, we know that ω is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω is a primitive cube root of unity. The other roots are ω² and ω itself. Also, we know that ω² + ω + 1 = 0 because the sum of all roots of x³ - 1 = 0 is zero, and since one root is 1, the sum of the other two roots must be -1.\n\nSo, our goal is to compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me write this expression down:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nHmm. Maybe I can combine these two fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, find the common denominator of (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's compute that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*(1) + 1*(ω²) + ω*(1) + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so substitute that in:\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nBut from earlier, we know that ω + ω² = -1. So:\n\n= 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo the common denominator is 1. That's interesting. So when we combine the two fractions:\n\nE = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ] = [1 + ω² + 1 + ω] / 1 = (2 + ω + ω²) / 1\n\nBut again, ω + ω² = -1, so:\n\nE = (2 + (-1)) = 1\n\nWait, so does that mean the expression simplifies to 1? But the problem says \"trouves todas les valeurs meas可能 de...\". So, is the value always 1, regardless of which ω we choose (as long as ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1)?\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify this. Because maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nFirst, the denominator (1 + ω)(1 + ω²):\n\nMultiply out:\n\n1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nSince ω³ = 1, then ω³ = 1, so substitute:\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nBut ω + ω² = -1 (since 1 + ω + ω² = 0 => ω + ω² = -1). Therefore:\n\nDenominator = 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nNumerator: (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo numerator is 1, denominator is 1, so E = 1/1 = 1. Therefore, regardless of the ω (as long as it's a primitive root, i.e., ω ≠ 1), the expression is always 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me check with specific values. Let's take ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω):\n\n1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2\n\nSo reciprocal is 1 / (1/2 + i√3/2) = multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2 / (1 + i√3) = multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2(1 - i√3) / [ (1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 2(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²):\n\n1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2\n\nReciprocal is 1 / (1/2 - i√3/2) = multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2 / (1 - i√3) = multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2(1 + i√3) / [1 + (√3)^2] = 2(1 + i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2\n\nAdding these two results:\n\n(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3]/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nSo indeed, the sum is 1. Therefore, regardless of which primitive cube root we take, the expression equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"trouves todas les valeurs possibles\", so maybe there's a case where ω = 1? But the problem states \"un nombre complexe ω que ω³ = 1\", so ω³ = 1, but then in the expression, if ω = 1, then we have denominators 1 + 1 = 2, so the expression would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Wait, but if ω = 1, then the expression is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even when ω = 1, the expression is 1? Wait, but ω is supposed to be a cube root of 1. So if ω = 1 is allowed, then the value is still 1. Wait, but in the problem statement, is ω allowed to be 1? The problem says \"un nombre complexe ω que ω³ = 1\". Since 1 is a cube root of 1, so yes, ω could be 1. However, when we derived earlier, we used that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, which is only true if ω ≠ 1. So in our previous calculation, we assumed ω ≠ 1, but if ω = 1, then the denominators 1 + ω and 1 + ω² become 2 and 2, so the expression is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even in that case, the expression is 1. Therefore, regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive root, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, note that \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity.

I need to find the shortest possible distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, visiting the other three points exactly once each.

Then, the answer will be the smallest of these four distances.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the positions of all the points based on the Asymptote code provided. Let me parse the coordinates:\n\n- A is at (-3, 3)\n- B is at (3, 0)\n- C is at (0, -4)\n- D is at (0, 0)\n\nSo, D is the origin, C is directly below D on the y-axis, B is to the right of D on the x-axis, and A is in the second quadrant, left and up from D.\n\nThe Asymptote code also draws some edges with labels:\n\n- D--B with length 3 (since it's labeled \"3\" on the draw command)\n- B--C with length 6 (label \"6\" on B--C)\n- C--B with length 4? Wait, hold on. The Asymptote code says:\n\ndraw(D--B--C--cycle); draw(D--A--B--cycle);draw(D--A--C--cycle);\n\nSo, the first cycle is D-B-C-D. The label \"3\" is on D-B, so that's 3 units. Then, D-A-B is another cycle, with label \"6\" on A-B. So the distance from A to B is 6. Then, A-C is labeled \"6\" as well, so A-C is 6. Then, D-C is labeled \"4\", so D-C is 4. Then, the edges from D: D-A is labeled \"5\", so D-A is 5. C-B is labeled \"4\", so C-B is 4.\n\nWait, let me list all the edges with their lengths:\n\n1. D to B: 3\n2. B to D: 3 (same as D to B)\n3. B to C: 6\n4. C to B: 4 (Wait, but the Asymptote code labels \"4\" on C--B, so that's 4. So the distance from C to B is 4.\n5. D to A: 5\n6. A to D: 5 (same as D to A)\n7. A to B: 6\n8.

C to D: 4 (same as D to C)\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, after drawing the three cycles, they label the edges. Let's check:\n\ndraw(D--B--C--cycle); This is D connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D. The labels on these edges are:\n\n- D--B: 3 (so that's 3)\n- B--C: 6 (so that's 6)\n- C--D: ?\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the label on C--D is \"4\". Wait, no. Wait, in the Asymptote code, after the three cycles, they label \"4\" on C--B. So the edges drawn are:\n\nFirst cycle: D--B (3), B--C (6), C--D (4). So that's D to B is 3, B to C is 6, C to D is 4. Then, the second cycle: D--A (5), A--B (6), B--D (6). Wait, but B--D is already labeled as 3 in the first cycle. Hmm, but maybe overlapping edges?\n\nWait, perhaps the Asymptote code is drawing multiple edges, but labels are only on the edges that are drawn last? Because in the code, they first draw D--B--C--cycle, then D--A--B--cycle, then D--A--C--cycle. So when they draw the first cycle, they label the edges D--B (3), B--C (6), C--D (4). Then, when they draw the second cycle, they label D--A (5), A--B (6), B--D (6). But B--D was already drawn in the first cycle. Similarly, the third cycle labels D--A (5), A--C (6), C--D (4). Wait, but A--C is labeled as 6, and C--D is labeled as 4.\n\nSo compiling all edges:\n\nFrom the first cycle (D-B-C-D):\n\n- D-B: 3\n\n- B-C: 6\n\n- C-D: 4\n\nFrom the second cycle (D-A-B-D):\n\n- D-A: 5\n\n- A-B: 6\n\n- B-D: 6 (but B-D is same as D-B, which is 3 in the first cycle. Wait, this seems conflicting. Maybe the labels are only on the edges that are drawn in each cycle, but not the same edges multiple times. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code:\n\ndraw(D--B--C--cycle); This draws edges D-B, B-C, C-D. Then labels \"3\", \"6\", \"4\" on those edges.\n\nThen draw(D--A--B--cycle); This draws edges D-A, A-B, B-D. Label \"5\" on D-A, \"6\" on A-B, and \"6\" on B-D. But B-D was already drawn as part of the first cycle. So in the first cycle, B-D is labeled as 3. Then in the second cycle, B-D is labeled as 6. Hmm, that's conflicting. Similarly, in the third cycle (D-A-C-D), they label \"5\" on D-A, \"6\" on A-C, \"4\" on C-D.\n\nSo the edges are:\n\nFrom the first cycle:\n\nD-B: 3\n\nB-C: 6\n\nC-D: 4\n\nFrom the second cycle:\n\nD-A: 5\n\nA-B: 6\n\nB-D: 6 (but D-B was 3 in the first cycle)\n\nFrom the third cycle:\n\nD-A: 5 (duplicate of the second cycle)\n\nA-C: 6\n\nC-D: 4 (duplicate of the first cycle)\n\nSo, there are overlapping edges with different labels. For example, D-B is labeled 3, but in the second cycle, B-D is labeled 6. Wait, but D-B and B-D are the same edge. So does that mean that the edge D-B has two different labels, 3 and 6? That can't be. So maybe there's a mistake in the Asymptote code's labeling?\n\nWait, looking at the Asymptote code again:\n\nlabel(\"3\", D--B, S); So the label \"3\" is on the edge from D to B.\n\nThen label(\"6\", A--B, NE); So the label \"6\" is on the edge from A to B.\n\nThen label(\"6\", A--C, SW); So the label \"6\" is on the edge from A to C.\n\nThen label(\"4\", D--C, NW+N); So the label \"4\" is on the edge from D to C.\n\nThen label(\"5\", A--D, SE+NE); So the label \"5\" is on the edge from A to D.\n\nThen label(\"5\", C--B, E); So the label \"5\" is on the edge from C to B.\n\nWait, so perhaps the labels are only on the edges that are drawn in each cycle, but not the same edges multiple times. Let me parse this again.\n\nFirst cycle: D--B--C--cycle. So edges D-B, B-C, C-D. Labels on these edges are \"3\", \"6\", \"4\". So D-B is 3, B-C is 6, C-D is 4.\n\nSecond cycle: D--A--B--cycle. Edges D-A, A-B, B-D. Labels on these edges: \"5\", \"6\", \"6\". So D-A is 5, A-B is 6, B-D is 6. But B-D is the same as D-B, which was labeled as 3 in the first cycle. So this seems contradictory. Similarly, third cycle: D--A--C--cycle. Edges D-A, A-C, C-D. Labels \"5\", \"6\", \"4\". So D-A is 5, A-C is 6, C-D is 4.\n\nSo, if we take all these labels into account, the edges are:\n\n- D-B: 3 (from first cycle)\n\n- B-C: 6 (from first cycle)\n\n- C-D: 4 (from first cycle)\n\n- D-A: 5 (from second cycle and third cycle)\n\n- A-B: 6 (from second cycle)\n\n- B-D: 6 (from second cycle, conflicting with D-B=3)\n\n- A-C: 6 (from third cycle)\n\n- C-B: 4 (from third cycle, labeled \"5\", which is conflicting)\n\nWait, hold on. The third cycle labels \"5\" on C--B. So C-B is 5? But in the first cycle, B-C is 6. So C-B is 5? That's different. So the edges:\n\nFrom first cycle:\n\nD-B: 3\n\nB-C: 6\n\nC-D: 4\n\nFrom second cycle:\n\nD-A: 5\n\nA-B: 6\n\nB-D: 6 (but D-B is 3)\n\nFrom third cycle:\n\nD-A: 5 (duplicate)\n\nA-C: 6\n\nC-D: 4 (duplicate)\n\nC-B: 5 (new label)\n\nSo now, compiling all edges with their lengths:\n\n1. D-B: 3\n\n2. B-C: 6\n\n3. C-D: 4\n\n4. D-A: 5\n\n5. A-B: 6\n\n6. B-D: 6 (same as D-B but labeled 6)\n\n7. A-C: 6\n\n8. C-B: 5 (new)\n\nWait, so there's an edge from C to B labeled 5? That's different from B-C being 6. So in the Asymptote code, when they draw C--B, they labeled it as 5. So C-B is 5, and B-C is 6. That seems contradictory. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, they first draw D--B--C--cycle, which is D-B, B-C, C-D. Then, after that, they draw D--A--B--cycle, which is D-A, A-B, B-D. Then, D--A--C--cycle, which is D-A, A-C, C-D. Then, they label C--B as 5. So the edge C-B is drawn after the first cycle, so perhaps it's a separate edge? Wait, but in the figure, is there an edge from C to B? Let me check the coordinates.\n\nThe coordinates are:\n\nA = (-3,3)\n\nB = (3,0)\n\nC = (0,-4)\n\nD = (0,0)\n\nSo plotting these:\n\n- D is at (0,0)\n\n- B is at (3,0), so it's on the x-axis, 3 units to the right of D.\n\n- C is at (0,-4), so it's on the y-axis, 4 units below D.\n\n- A is at (-3,3), so it's in the second quadrant, left 3, up 3.\n\nSo the edges:\n\n- D-B: from (0,0) to (3,0), which is 3 units along the x-axis. That's length 3.\n\n- B-C: from (3,0) to (0,-4). Let's compute the distance between B (3,0) and C (0,-4). The distance is sqrt((3-0)^2 + (0 - (-4))^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the label on B-C is \"6\". Wait, that contradicts the actual distance. Wait, hold on. Wait, sqrt(3² + 4²) is 5, so the distance between B and C should be 5. But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 6. That must be an error. Similarly, the distance from A to B: A is (-3,3), B is (3,0). The distance is sqrt((3 - (-3))² + (0 - 3)²) = sqrt(6² + (-3)²) = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708. But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 6. Hmm, so that's also an error. Similarly, A to C: A (-3,3) to C (0,-4). Distance sqrt((0 - (-3))² + (-4 - 3)²) = sqrt(9 + 49) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616. But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 6. So all these labels in the Asymptote code are incorrect? That can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the distances using the coordinates:\n\n1. D (0,0) to B (3,0): distance is 3 units. Correct.\n\n2. B (3,0) to C (0,-4): difference in x is 3-0=3, difference in y is 0 - (-4)=4. So distance is sqrt(3² + 4²)=5. But Asymptote labels this as 6. So discrepancy here.\n\n3. C (0,-4) to D (0,0): distance is 4 units. Asymptote says 4, which is correct.\n\n4. D (0,0) to A (-3,3): difference in x is -3-0=-3, difference in y is 3-0=3. Distance sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2)=sqrt(9+9)=sqrt(18)=4.2426. Asymptote labels this as 5. So discrepancy.\n\n5. A (-3,3) to B (3,0): as above, sqrt(45)=6.708. Asymptote says 6.\n\n6. B (3,0) to A (-3,3): same as above, 6.708. Asymptote says", "answer": "13"}
