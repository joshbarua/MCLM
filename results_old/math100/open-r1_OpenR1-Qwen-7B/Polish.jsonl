Let me see. The diagram is a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. The sides are DE, EF, and DF, with EF being 7 units long. They want DE.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the sine of an angle in a right triangle means. The sine of an angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle DEF, angle D is one of the non-right angles. So, sin D would be the side opposite to angle D divided by the hypotenuse. \n\nLooking at the triangle, angle D is at point D. The sides adjacent to angle D are DE and DF. Wait, no. In triangle DEF, angle D is at vertex D. The sides connected to angle D are DF and DE. Since it's a right-angled triangle at E, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which is DF. So, the legs are DE and EF.\n\nTherefore, angle D is adjacent to side DE and opposite to side EF. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. The sides adjacent to angle D are DE and DF. The side opposite to angle D is EF. Wait, but EF is given as 7. So sin D is opposite side over hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D is EF, which is 7, and the hypotenuse is DF. So sin D = EF / DF = 7 / DF. They say sin D is 0.7, so 7 / DF = 0.7. Then DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me compute that. 7 divided by 0.7 is 10. So DF is 10. So the hypotenuse DF is 10 units long.\n\nNow, the triangle has legs DE and EF. EF is 7, DF is 10. So DE can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since DF is the hypotenuse, DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2. Plugging in the numbers: DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. So DE^2 + 49 = 100. Then DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. Therefore, DE = sqrt(51). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, sqrt(51) is approximately 7.141, which is a bit longer than EF which is 7, which seems reasonable. The hypotenuse DF is 10, so DE is the other leg. Since 7.141 squared is about 51, and 10 squared is 100, yes, that adds up. So DE is sqrt(51). Let me just verify again the steps.\n\n1. Identify the triangle as right-angled at E.\n2. Angle D: sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF.\n3. Given sin D = 0.7, so 7 / DF = 0.7 → DF = 10.\n4. Use Pythagorean theorem: DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2 → DE^2 + 49 = 100 → DE^2 = 51 → DE = sqrt(51).\n5. Check the answer: sqrt(51) ≈ 7.14, which is plausible as the other leg. Hypotenuse is 10, which is longer than both legs, which makes sense.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no alternative interpretation. For example, maybe DE is the hypotenuse? But no, in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. The right angle is at E, so the hypotenuse is DF. Therefore, DE and EF are the legs. So DE is one leg, EF is the other leg. So the steps are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that angle D is at a different vertex, but in the Asymptote code, they define points D, E, F. Then D is (sqrt(51),7), E is (0,7), F is (0,0). So plotting those coordinates, point E is at (0,7), F is at (0,0), so EF is vertical from (0,7) to (0,0), which is length 7. D is at (sqrt(51),7), so DE is horizontal from (0,7) to (sqrt(51),7), so length sqrt(51). DF is from (sqrt(51),7) to (0,0), which would be the hypotenuse.\n\nSo using coordinates, DE is indeed sqrt(51), EF is 7, and DF is sqrt( (sqrt(51))^2 + 7^2 ) = sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. So that matches. Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). So the answer should be sqrt(51), which in boxed form is \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of \\( DE \\) is \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the length of \\( DE \\) in the right triangle \\( DEF \\) with a right angle at \\( E \\), we start by noting that \\( \\sin D = 0.7 \\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.

Let me recall how complex number rotations work. \n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back. The general formula for rotating a complex number z around a point c by an angle θ is:\n\nw = (z - c) * e^{iθ} + c\n\nSince the rotation is counterclockwise by π/4, θ is positive. The exponential term e^{iθ} for θ = π/4 is cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, first, let me compute z - c. Given z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i and c = 2 - 3i. Subtracting c from z:\n\nReal part: (2 + √2) - 2 = √2\n\nImaginary part: [ - (3 + 3√2) ] - (-3) = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2\n\nTherefore, z - c = √2 - 3√2 i\n\nNow, multiply this by e^{iπ/4} which is √2/2 + i√2/2. Let me compute that.\n\nMultiplying (√2 - 3√2 i) by (√2/2 + i√2/2):\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\nReal part: √2 * √2/2 + (-3√2 i) * (√2/2)\nImaginary part: √2 * (i√2/2) + (-3√2 i) * (i√2/2)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nReal part:\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2 / 2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: (-3√2 i) * (√2/2) = (-3√2 * √2 / 2)i = (-3*2 / 2)i = (-3)i\n\nSo total real part: 1 - 3i? Wait, no. Wait, the first term is real and the second term is imaginary. Wait, no. Wait, the first term is real part contribution, and the second term is imaginary part contribution? Wait, no, when multiplying complex numbers, the real parts and imaginary parts combine. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when you multiply (a + bi)(c + di), the real part is ac - bd and the imaginary part is ad + bc. Wait, no, actually:\n\n(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi² = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. Since i² = -1. So the real part is ac - bd and the imaginary part is ad + bc.\n\nSo in this case, a = √2, b = -3√2, c = √2/2, d = √2/2.\n\nSo real part: a*c - b*d = √2*(√2/2) - (-3√2)*(√2/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n√2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 = 1\n\n- (-3√2)*(√2/2) = +3√2*(√2)/2 = 3*(2)/2 = 3\n\nSo total real part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nImaginary part: a*d + b*c = √2*(√2/2) + (-3√2)*(√2/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n√2*(√2/2) = 2/2 = 1\n\n-3√2*(√2/2) = -3*2/2 = -3\n\nSo total imaginary part: 1 - 3 = -2\n\nTherefore, the product (z - c) * e^{iπ/4} = 4 - 2i\n\nThen, add back c to translate back. c is 2 - 3i.\n\nSo w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, z - c:\n\nReal part: (2 + √2) - 2 = √2. Correct.\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3√2) - (-3) = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2. Correct. So z - c = √2 - 3√2 i.\n\nMultiply by e^{iπ/4} = √2/2 + i√2/2.\n\nCompute the product:\n\nReal part: (√2)(√2/2) + (-3√2)(-√2/2) = (2/2) + (3*2/2) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, hold on. Wait, the real part is ac - bd, where a = √2, b = -3√2, c = √2/2, d = √2/2.\n\nSo ac = √2*(√2/2) = 1\n\nbd = (-3√2)*(√2/2) = (-3*2)/2 = -3\n\nTherefore, real part is ac - bd = 1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nImaginary part: ad + bc = √2*(√2/2) + (-3√2)*(√2/2) = (2/2) + (-3*2/2) = 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 4 - 2i.\n\nThen, add c = 2 - 3i:\n\nw = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 -5i. So w = 6 -5i.\n\nWait, but let me check if the angle was indeed π/4. Yes, the problem states a rotation of π/4, which is 45 degrees, counterclockwise. So the rotation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify using coordinates. Let's see.\n\nOriginal point z is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). The center of rotation c is (2, -3). So translating z by subtracting c gives (√2, -3√2). Then rotating this point 45 degrees counterclockwise around the origin.\n\nThe rotation matrix for 45 degrees is [cosθ -sinθ; sinθ cosθ]. For θ = π/4, cosθ = sinθ = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.\n\nApplying the rotation matrix to the translated point (√2, -3√2):\n\nNew x-coordinate: √2 * cosθ - (-3√2) * sinθ = √2*(√2/2) + 3√2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 + (6)/2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNew y-coordinate: √2 * sinθ + (-3√2) * cosθ = √2*(√2/2) - 3√2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 - (6)/2 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nSo after rotation, the translated point is (4, -2). Then translating back by adding c (2, -3):\n\nFinal coordinates: (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5). Therefore, the complex number is 6 -5i. Which matches the earlier result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6 -5i.

I remember that simplifying square roots involves breaking down the number into its prime factors and then seeing if any of those factors can be taken out of the square root as whole numbers. Alright, let's start by factoring 242.\n\nFirst, I know that 242 is an even number because it ends with a 2, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 242 by 2. 242 divided by 2 is 121. So, 2 times 121 equals 242. Now, I need to factor 121. Wait, 121 is a well-known square number. Isn't it 11 squared? Let me check: 11 times 11 is 121. Yes, that's right. So, 121 factors into 11 and 11.\n\nPutting that all together, the prime factorization of 242 is 2 multiplied by 11 multiplied by 11. So, √242 can be written as √(2 × 11 × 11). Since square roots can take the product of squares outside the radical, I can take the 11 out because it's squared. So that would leave me with 11 times the square root of 2. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If I have √(11² × 2), that's equal to √(11²) times √2, which is 11√2. Yup, that seems right. So, simplifying √242 gives me 11√2. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any other factors. Let's try dividing 242 by 11 to see if there's another pair. 242 divided by 11 is 22. So, 11 times 22 is 242. Then 22 can be broken down into 2 times 11. So, 242 is 11 × 2 × 11, which is the same as 2 × 11 × 11. Yep, that matches. So there are no more factors beyond that.

Hmm, circular permutations can be a bit tricky because rotations are considered the same. Let me start by recalling some basics.\n\nFirst, for circular arrangements of n people, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because fixing one person's position removes the rotational symmetry. But in this case, three specific people must be seated together. So maybe I can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit or \"block.\" That way, instead of 8 people, we have 6 units to arrange around the table: the block (which contains Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) and the other 5 individuals.\n\nWait, but if the block is considered a single entity, then arranging these 6 units around a circular table would be (6-1)! = 5! ways. However, within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves. How many ways can they be arranged within the block? That's 3! since there are three people. So, the total number of arrangements should be 5! multiplied by 3!.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, Thomas as a single block**: So, instead of 8 people, we have 1 block + 5 individuals = 6 units.\n2. **Circular arrangement of 6 units**: Since the table is round, the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 120 (since 5! = 120).\n3. **Arrangements within the block**: The three people can be ordered among themselves in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nMultiplying these together gives 120 * 6 = 720. So, the total number of ways is 720.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes in circular permutations, fixing the position of the block can be a point of confusion. Let me think again.\n\nIf we fix the block in one position relative to the table, then the number of arrangements is indeed (number of units -1)! which is 5! for 6 units. Alternatively, another way to think about circular permutations with a block is to fix one person's position to eliminate rotations. But since the block needs to be treated as a single entity, maybe fixing the block's position would complicate things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we first fix Pierre's position at the table to account for the circular symmetry. Then, the block (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) can be arranged in 2 ways relative to Pierre (since they need to sit together). Wait, no, that might not be the case. Wait, if we fix Pierre's seat, then Rosa and Thomas must be either to his left or right. But wait, no, they can be in any order. So, if Pierre is fixed, then Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2! ways next to him. But then the rest of the people can be arranged in 5! ways. But that might not account for the block as a whole.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is conflicting with the previous one. Let me clarify.\n\nIf we fix Pierre's position, then the block (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) can be arranged in the remaining seats adjacent to Pierre. But actually, in a circular table, fixing one person's position removes the rotational symmetry. So, once Pierre is fixed, the seats are linear relative to him. Then, the block can be arranged in the seats next to Pierre. But perhaps this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct. Treating the three as a single block, so 6 units, leading to 5! arrangements, multiplied by 3! for the internal arrangements. That gives 120 * 6 = 720. Let me check with another method.\n\nSuppose we consider the total number of circular arrangements without any restrictions: (8-1)! = 7! = 5040.\n\nNow, if we want to calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting together, we can use the formula for the number of circular arrangements where k specific people are together. The formula is (n - k)! * k! for linear arrangements, but for circular arrangements, it's (n - k)! * (k - 1)! ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall. For linear arrangements, the number of ways to arrange n people with k specific people together is (n - k + 1)! * k!. But in circular arrangements, the formula is slightly different because rotations are considered the same.\n\nAlternatively, here's another way to think about it. If we want Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to be seated together, we can treat them as a single entity. Then, along with the other 5 people, we have 6 entities to arrange around the table. The number of circular arrangements for these 6 entities is (6 - 1)! = 120. Then, within the entity, the three people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, total is 120 * 6 = 720. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, this seems to confirm the initial answer.\n\nBut let me check with another example. Suppose there are 3 people: Pierre, Rosa, Thomas. How many ways can they sit around a table with all three together? Well, since they are all together, it's just 1 way (because in a circular table, arranging three people together can be rotated, but since they're all sitting together, it's considered one arrangement). But according to the formula: (3 - 3 + 1)! * 3! = 1! * 6 = 6, which is not correct. Wait, that contradicts. So, maybe my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, no. If all three are sitting together, the number of circular arrangements should be 1, because rotating the entire block doesn't change the arrangement. But according to the formula (n - k)! * k! where n=3, k=3: (3 - 3)! * 3! = 0! * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6. Which is wrong. So, my previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nSo, what's the mistake here? When all three are sitting together, the number of circular arrangements is 1, because you can rotate the block and it's considered the same. But according to the formula (n - k)! * k! = (3 - 3)! * 3! = 1 * 6 = 6. Which is wrong. Therefore, my formula is not applicable here. So, maybe the approach of treating them as a single block and then arranging around the table is correct, but in the case where n = k, the formula gives an answer that doesn't match reality.\n\nWait, in the problem with 3 people all together around a table, the correct answer should be 1, not 6. So, why does the formula give 6? Because in the linear case, it's (3 - 3 + 1)! * 3! = 1! * 6 = 6, which is correct for linear arrangements. But in circular arrangements, the formula might need adjustment.\n\nSo, in circular arrangements, if you fix the block's position, then the number of arrangements is (number of units - 1)! * k! ?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in circular arrangements, when you fix the block's position, you don't need to subtract 1. Let me think.\n\nIf we have a circular table and we want to seat 3 people together, we can fix their position relative to the table. Since the table is circular, fixing one person's position removes the rotational symmetry. So, if we fix Pierre's position, then Rosa and Thomas must be either to his left or right. But since they need to sit together, they can be arranged in 2 ways (Rosa on left, Thomas on right, or vice versa). Then, the rest of the seats are fixed. Wait, but in this case, if there are 3 people, then there are 3 seats. So, if they are all sitting together, once Pierre is fixed, the block can be arranged in 2 ways, but since it's a circle, is that 1 way? Wait, no. If we fix Pierre's position, then the block can be arranged in 2 ways relative to Pierre. But in circular arrangements, since we've fixed Pierre's position, rotating the block doesn't count as a new arrangement. So, if we fix Pierre, then the block can be arranged in 2 ways (Rosa and Thomas on either side). But if Pierre is fixed, then the block's internal arrangement is 2, and there's only one way to seat the block because the other seats are occupied by the other two people. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in circular permutations where all three are seated together, the number is (n - k + 1). Wait, but n=3, k=3, so 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when all three are seated together in a circle, there's only one arrangement because you can rotate the entire block and it's considered the same. So, if you fix one person's position, the other two can be arranged in 2 ways, but since the block is considered as a single unit, the number of arrangements is 1. Hmm, maybe.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the formula. So, perhaps my initial approach for the original problem is correct, but in the case where all three are seated together, the formula (n - k)! * k! gives 6, but the actual number is 1. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, there are 8 people, and 3 of them need to sit together. So, treating them as a block, we have 6 units. The number of circular arrangements is (6 - 1)! = 120, multiplied by 3! = 6, giving 720. But if all three are seated together in a circle, the formula gives 6, which is wrong. So, why is that?\n\nWait, maybe in the case where all three are seated together, the formula (n - k)! * k! is actually correct. Let me see. If n=3, k=3, then (n - k)! * k! = 0! * 6 = 6. But in reality, it's 1. So, that's a problem. So, why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps in circular arrangements, when the number of units is 1 (i.e., the entire group is considered as a single unit), then the number of circular arrangements is (1 - 1)! = 0! = 1. So, if we have the entire group as a single unit, there's 1 arrangement. Then, within the unit, the people can be arranged in 3! ways. So, total is 1 * 6 = 6. But in reality, if all three are seated together around the table, how many distinct arrangements are there? If we fix one person's position, say Pierre, then Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2 ways. But since the table is circular, fixing Pierre's position removes the need to consider rotations. So, the number of arrangements is 2. Wait, now I'm confused again.\n\nLet me take a step back. Let's think about linear arrangements first. If three people must sit together in a line, the number of ways is 2 * 3! = 12. Because the block can be in two orders (Rosa-Thomas or Thomas-Rosa), and the block itself can be placed in different positions. But in a circular table, the number of arrangements is different.\n\nIn a circular table, if three people must sit together, how many arrangements are there? Let's fix Pierre's position. Then, Rosa and Thomas have to be either to his left or right. Since they need to sit together, they can be arranged in 2 ways (Rosa on left, Thomas on right, or vice versa). The rest of the people are seated around the table, but since we've fixed Pierre's position, the other 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways. Wait, but hold on, if Pierre is fixed, then the block (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) can be arranged in 2 ways (since Rosa and Thomas can be swapped), and the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways. So, total arrangements would be 2 * 5! = 240. But according to the formula (n - k)! * k! = (8 - 3)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 720. Which contradicts.\n\nBut this is confusing. Which approach is correct?\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as follows:\n\n- In circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n people where k specific people must sit together is (n - k)! * k!.\n\nWait, but in linear permutations, it's (n - k + 1)! * k!.\n\nBut in circular permutations, when we fix one person's position to account for rotational symmetry, we have (n - 1)! total arrangements. So, for the case where k specific people must sit together, treating them as a block, we have (n - k - 1)! * k!.\n\nWait, perhaps. Let's see.\n\nIf we fix one person's position (say Pierre), then the block (Pierre, Rosa, Thomas) can be arranged in (3 - 1)! = 2 ways (since they have to sit together, once Pierre is fixed, Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2 ways). Then, the remaining (n - k) = 8 - 3 = 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways. So, total arrangements would be 2 * 5! = 240.\n\nBut according to the formula (n - k)! * k! = (8 - 3)! * 3! = 5! * 6 = 720. Which is different.\n\nWait, so which is correct? Let's check with a small example.\n\nSuppose n=4 people: Pierre, Rosa, Thomas, and Alice. We want Pierre, Rosa, Thomas to sit together.\n\nIf we fix Pierre's position, then Rosa and Thomas can be arranged in 2 ways (Rosa-Thomas or Thomas-Rosa). Then, Alice can be seated in any of the remaining 3 seats (since the table is circular, after fixing Pierre, there are 3 seats left). Wait, but in a circular table with 4 people, fixing one person's position leaves 3 seats. If Pierre is fixed, Alice can be in seat 2, 3, or 4 (assuming seats are labeled 1 to 4, with Pierre in seat 1). Then, between seat 1 and seat 2, there's a gap, but since the block is Pierre, Rosa, Thomas, they have to occupy three consecutive seats. Wait, no. If we fix Pierre in seat 1, then Rosa and Thomas must be in seats 2 and 3 or seats 4 and 1? Wait, no. If they need to sit together, they must occupy", "answer": "720"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when expanding a binomial like (a + b)^n, the terms are given by the binomial theorem, which is the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. So, in this case, a is 10x³ and b is -1/(2x²), and n is 5. \n\nThe question is asking for the constant term. A constant term would be the term where the exponent of x is zero, right? So, I need to find the term in the expansion where the exponent of x is 0. To do that, I need to look at how the exponents of x in each term combine.\n\nLet me write out the general term in the expansion. The general term T_k is (5 choose k) * (10x³)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x²))^k. Let me compute the exponents of x here. The first part, (10x³)^(5 - k), would contribute 3*(5 - k) exponents of x. The second part, (-1/(2x²))^k, would contribute -2k exponents of x. So, combining those, the exponent of x in the term T_k is 3*(5 - k) - 2k. \n\nSo, setting that equal to zero for the constant term: 3*(5 - k) - 2k = 0. Let's solve for k. Expanding that: 15 - 3k - 2k = 0, which simplifies to 15 - 5k = 0. Then, 5k = 15, so k = 3. \n\nOkay, so when k is 3, that term will be the constant term. Now, let's compute that term. \n\nFirst, (5 choose 3) is 10. Then, (10x³)^(5 - 3) is (10x³)^2, which is 100x⁶. Then, (-1/(2x²))^3 is (-1)^3/(2³x⁶) which is -1/(8x⁶). Multiplying those together: 10 * 100x⁶ * (-1)/(8x⁶). \n\nThe x⁶ and 1/x⁶ cancel out, leaving 10 * 100 * (-1)/8. Let's compute that: 10 * 100 is 1000, and 1000 * (-1) is -1000. Then, -1000 divided by 8 is -125. \n\nSo, the constant term is -125. Wait, let me double-check that. \n\nFirst, (5 choose 3) is indeed 10. Then, (10x³)^2 is 10²*(x³)^2 = 100x⁶. Then, (-1/(2x²))^3 is (-1)^3/(2^3)*(x^-2)^3 = -1/8x^-6. Multiplying these terms: 10 * 100x⁶ * (-1/8x^-6) = 10 * 100 * (-1)/8 * x^(6 - 6) = 10 * 100 * (-1)/8 * x⁰ = 10 * 100 * (-1)/8 * 1. \n\nCalculating that: 10 * 100 is 1000, 1000 * (-1) is -1000, -1000 divided by 8 is -125. Yep, that seems right. \n\nSo, the constant term is -125. Let me make sure there's no other term where the exponent is zero. For example, if k was 4, the exponent would be 3*(5 - 4) - 2*4 = 3*1 - 8 = 3 - 8 = -5, which is not zero. If k=2, exponent is 3*(5 -2) - 2*2 = 9 -4=5, not zero. k=1, exponent=12 -2=10, nope. k=0, exponent=15 -0=15, nope. So, only k=3 gives exponent zero. Therefore, the constant term is indeed -125.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe constant term is \\boxed{-125}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\), we use the binomial theorem.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. \n\nFirst, n ≡ 2 mod 7 means that when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to substitute n like that. Instead, perhaps I can work directly with the congruence. \n\nThe expression is (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Since we're dealing with modulo 7, maybe I can simplify each term modulo 7 first before multiplying them together. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with each term:\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7, because n ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\nAnd n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 ≡ 8 mod 7. Wait, 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. So n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 4 * 6 = 24. Then, 24 mod 7. 7*3=21, so 24 - 21 = 3. So 24 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nThen, multiply by 1: 3 * 1 = 3. So the entire product is ≡ 3 mod 7. Therefore, the remainder is 3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should check with a specific value of n that satisfies n ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's pick n = 2. Then compute (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 192. Then divide 192 by 7. Let's see: 7*27=189, so 192 - 189 = 3. So the remainder is 3. That matches my earlier result. \n\nAnother example: n = 9 (since 9 ≡ 2 mod 7). Then (9 + 2)(9 + 4)(9 + 6) = 11 * 13 * 15. Let's compute that. 11*13=143, then 143*15. 143*10=1430, 143*5=715, so total is 1430 + 715 = 2145. Now divide 2145 by 7. 7*300=2100, so 2145 - 2100 = 45. Then 45 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, remainder 3. So again, remainder 3. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7, as before. Then n + 4 = (n + 2) + 2 ≡ 4 + 2 ≡ 6 mod 7. Similarly, n + 6 = (n + 2) + 4 ≡ 4 + 4 ≡ 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. So again, the same terms: 4, 6, 1. Multiply them: 4*6=24≡3 mod7, 3*1=3. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) can be rewritten in terms of (n - 5)(n - 3)(n - 1) or something? Wait, no. Let me see. Let's expand the product. Maybe expanding would help?\n\nWait, but expanding might be more complicated. Let me try. Let's compute (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). First, compute (n + 2)(n + 4) = n² + 6n + 8. Then multiply by (n + 6):\n\n(n² + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n³ + 6n² + 6n² + 36n + 8n + 48 = n³ + 12n² + 44n + 48.\n\nBut now, modulo 7, coefficients can be reduced. Let's see:\n\nn³ + 12n² + 44n + 48 ≡ n³ + (12 mod7)n² + (44 mod7)n + (48 mod7).\n\nCalculating each coefficient:\n\n12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5, so 12 ≡5 mod7.\n\n44 divided by 7: 7*6=42, 44-42=2, so 44≡2 mod7.\n\n48 divided by 7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6, so 48≡6 mod7.\n\nTherefore, the expression modulo7 is n³ +5n² +2n +6.\n\nBut since n ≡2 mod7, substitute n=2 into this expression:\n\n2³ +5*2² +2*2 +6 = 8 +5*4 +4 +6 = 8 +20 +4 +6 = 38.\n\nNow, 38 divided by7: 7*5=35, 38-35=3. So remainder 3. Same answer again. \n\nSo regardless of the method, the remainder is 3. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with another value. Let me take n=16 (since 16≡2 mod7). Then compute (16 +2)(16 +4)(16 +6)=18*20*22. Let's compute 18*20=360, then 360*22=7920. Now divide 7920 by7. 7*1131=7917, so 7920 -7917=3. Again, remainder 3. So that's three different examples all giving remainder 3. Seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using polynomial congruences. Since n ≡2 mod7, then in the ring of integers modulo7, n=2. So substitute n=2 into the polynomial (n+2)(n+4)(n+6). Which is exactly what I did earlier, getting 4*6*1=24≡3 mod7. So that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, all approaches confirm that the remainder is 3. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, we simplify each term modulo 7:\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nNext, we compute the product of these simplified terms modulo 7:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\equiv 24 \\times 1 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\nSince \\( 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\), we have:\n\\[\n3 \\times 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can substitute specific values of \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\):\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), \\((2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 192\\).

Hmm, let's start by recalling what a regular pentagon is. It's a five-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular pentagon is 108 degrees, right? But I think the key here is the symmetry of the shape.\n\nSince the pentagon is regular, it should have rotational symmetry. Rotational symmetry means that if you rotate the shape around its center by a certain angle, it will look the same as it did before. The number of degrees it needs to be rotated to look the same is called the angle of rotation. For regular polygons, the angle of rotational symmetry can be calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides. So, for a pentagon, which has 5 sides, the formula would be 360 divided by 5. Let me check that.\n\nIf I divide 360 by 5, that gives me 72 degrees. So, rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees should make it coincide with its original position. But wait, does that mean that rotating it 72 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise would work? The problem says it's being rotated in the counterclockwise direction. But does the direction affect the minimal number? Hmm, maybe not. The angle is the same regardless of direction, but the direction is specified here. So the answer is 72 degrees.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think about how the vertices move when you rotate the pentagon. Each vertex is separated by 72 degrees. So, if you rotate it by 72 degrees, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex. Since there are five vertices, rotating by 72 degrees would cycle all the vertices into their original positions. Therefore, after one such rotation, the pentagon would look exactly the same as before. So, the minimal number of degrees is indeed 72.\n\nWait, but what if I rotate it by more degrees? For example, 144 degrees. Then, it would be rotated twice, which would also make it coincide with the original position. But the question asks for the minimal number of degrees. So, 72 is the smallest angle that works. 36 degrees would not be enough because that's less than 72, and the pentagon wouldn't be aligned properly. So yes, 72 is the minimal.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the order of rotational symmetry for a regular n-gon is n. So, the pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5. Each rotation that maps the polygon to itself is 360 divided by 5, which is 72. Therefore, the minimal angle is 72 degrees. \n\nI think that's solid. The key points are that the pentagon is regular, thus has equal spacing between its vertices around the center, and the minimal rotation is the smallest angle that aligns all vertices with their original positions. Since there are five vertices, the angle between each vertex is 72 degrees. Therefore, 72 degrees is the answer. The direction, counterclockwise, is just the direction in which you perform the rotation, not the angle itself. So, the answer should be 72 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe minimal angle required for a regular pentagon to coincide with its original position after counterclockwise rotation around its center is determined by its symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it maps onto itself every \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ \\) rotation. \n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{72}", "answer": "72"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other. That means the midpoints of the diagonals are the same. So, maybe I can use the midpoint formula here.\n\nFirst, let me label the given points to make it easier. Let's call them A(5, 3), B(6, 8), C(7, 4), and D(x, y). Now, I need to figure out which of these points are adjacent vertices. Since it's a parallelogram, the order of the points matters. Depending on how the points are connected, the fourth vertex could be in different positions. Maybe I should consider different cases based on which sides are considered adjacent.\n\nCase 1: Suppose A and B are adjacent, B and C are adjacent. Then the fourth vertex D would be such that AB is parallel and equal to CD, and BC is parallel and equal to AD. Let me check this. If AB is from A(5,3) to B(6,8), then the vector AB is (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). Then CD should be the same vector. Since C is (7,4), then D would be C + AB vector: (7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8,9). Then check if BC is parallel and equal to AD. Vector BC is (7-6, 4-8) = (1, -4). Vector AD is (x -5, y -3). If D is (8,9), then AD is (8-5, 9-3) = (3,6). But BC is (1, -4), which is not the same as AD (3,6). So that doesn't work. So maybe this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Maybe A and C are adjacent? Let's try that. If A(5,3) and C(7,4) are adjacent, then the vector AC is (7-5,4-3) = (2,1). Then the opposite side would be BD. So BD should be equal and parallel to AC. So vector BD should be (2,1). Since B is (6,8), then D would be B + BD vector: (6 + 2, 8 +1) = (8,9). Then check the other sides. Vector AB is (6-5,8-3) = (1,5). Vector CD is (8-7,9-4) = (1,5). That works because AB and CD are equal and parallel. Also, vector BC is (7-6,4-8) = (1,-4). Vector AD is (8-5,9-3) = (3,6). Hmm, but BC and AD are not equal and parallel. Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides should be equal and parallel, but actually, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Wait, maybe I got confused here. Let me verify.\n\nIf A and C are adjacent, then the sides are AC and CD. Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, adjacent vertices would be connected by sides. So if A and B are connected, then B and C are connected, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the order of the vertices. The problem states \"wspórz-inskiermann--li edurow--kadrupi\" which I think translates to \"the coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y) with x >7\". So the four vertices are given as four points, but the order is not specified. So maybe the order is not necessarily A-B-C-D but in some order. So I need to check all possible configurations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the property that in a parallelogram, the sum of the coordinates of opposite vertices are equal. Wait, no, that's for the diagonals. The midpoint of the diagonals is the same. So for a parallelogram with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4), the midpoints of the diagonals (x1+x3)/2, (y1+y3)/2 and (x2+x4)/2, (y2+y4)/2 must be equal. So maybe that's a way to approach it.\n\nGiven three points: (5,3), (6,8), (7,4). Let's denote them as P, Q, R. The fourth point is S(x,y). Then, depending on which points are opposite vertices, the midpoints should be equal.\n\nSo, possible scenarios:\n\n1. P and R are opposite, Q and S are opposite. Then midpoint of PR is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6, 3.5). Midpoint of QS is ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). So set equal:\n\n(6, 3.5) = ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2)\n\nTherefore:\n\n(6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6\n\n(8 + y)/2 = 3.5 => 8 + y = 7 => y = -1\n\nBut x =6, which is not greater than 7. So this gives S(6, -1), but since x must be >7, this is invalid.\n\n2. P and Q are opposite, R and S are opposite. Then midpoint of PQ is ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (5.5, 5.5). Midpoint of RS is ((7 + x)/2, (4 + y)/2). Setting equal:\n\n(7 + x)/2 = 5.5 => 7 + x = 11 => x = 4\n\n(4 + y)/2 = 5.5 => 4 + y = 11 => y =7\n\nSo S(4,7). But x=4 is not greater than 7, so invalid.\n\n3. Q and R are opposite, P and S are opposite. Midpoint of QR is ((6+7)/2, (8+4)/2) = (6.5, 6). Midpoint of PS is ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2). Setting equal:\n\n(5 + x)/2 =6.5 =>5 +x=13 =>x=8\n\n(3 + y)/2=6 =>3 + y=12 =>y=9\n\nSo S(8,9). Here x=8>7, which satisfies the condition. So x + y=17. That's a possible answer. Let me check if this configuration is correct.\n\nIf Q and R are opposite, then the sides would be PQ and QR. Wait, but in a parallelogram, if Q and R are opposite, then the sides would be PQ and RS, QR and SP. Let me verify if PQ is equal and parallel to RS, and QR is equal and parallel to SP.\n\nPQ vector: Q - P = (6-5,8-3)=(1,5)\n\nRS vector: S - R = (8-7,9-4)=(1,5). So PQ and RS are equal and parallel. QR vector: R - Q = (7-6,4-8)=(1,-4)\n\nSP vector: P - S = (5-8,3-9)=(-3,-6). Wait, QR vector is (1,-4), SP vector is (-3,-6). These are not scalar multiples. So maybe this is not a parallelogram? Wait, but according to the midpoint calculation, the midpoints are equal, so diagonals bisect each other. Wait, but if the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, then it's a parallelogram regardless of the sides. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's think again. If the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, then it's a parallelogram. So even if the sides aren't matching up, as long as the diagonals bisect each other, it's a parallelogram. So maybe even if the sides aren't matching up, but the diagonals do, it's still a parallelogram. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, which is equivalent to the midpoints being the same. So if the midpoints are the same, then it's a parallelogram. So regardless of the sides, as long as the diagonals bisect each other, it's a parallelogram. So maybe even if the sides aren't parallel, but the diagonals do bisect each other, but that's not possible unless it's a parallelogram.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the necessary and sufficient conditions. In a quadrilateral, if the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, then it's a parallelogram. So regardless of the sides, if diagonals bisect each other, it's a parallelogram. So even if the sides aren't equal or parallel, but the diagonals do bisect each other, but that's only possible if it's a parallelogram. Wait, no, actually, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but the converse is also true: if the diagonals bisect each other, then it's a parallelogram. So if the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, then it's a parallelogram. Therefore, the third case gives a valid parallelogram. Therefore, S(8,9) is the correct fourth vertex, with x=8>7, so x+y=17.\n\nWait, but let me check another case to make sure there's no other possibility.\n\nCase 4: Maybe P and S are opposite, Q and R are opposite. Wait, that's similar to case 3. Because if P and S are opposite, then the diagonals are PS and QR. If we set their midpoints equal, then same as case 3. But we already considered that. So maybe there are only three possible configurations, depending on which two points are considered opposite. But since we already found one where x>7, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider another configuration where different pairs are opposite. For example, suppose A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y). Let's see if there's another way to assign the points as opposite vertices.\n\nSuppose A and B are opposite, C and D are opposite. Then midpoint of AB is ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (5.5, 5.5). Midpoint of CD is ((7 + x)/2, (4 + y)/2). Setting equal:\n\n(7 + x)/2 =5.5 =>7 +x=11 =>x=4\n\n(4 + y)/2=5.5 =>4 + y=11 =>y=7\n\nSo D(4,7). But x=4 <7, which contradicts x>7. So invalid.\n\nAnother configuration: A and C are opposite, B and D are opposite. As we did earlier, gives D(6,-1) which is invalid.\n\nAnother configuration: A and D are opposite, B and C are opposite. Midpoint of AD: ((5 +x)/2, (3 + y)/2). Midpoint of BC: ((6 +7)/2, (8 +4)/2)=(6.5,6). So set equal:\n\n(5 +x)/2=6.5 =>5 +x=13 =>x=8\n\n(3 + y)/2=6 =>3 + y=12 =>y=9\n\nSo D(8,9), which is the same as before. So regardless of how we assign the points, the only valid solution with x>7 is (8,9). So x+y=17. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n\nBut let me just confirm once more by checking the vectors. If the fourth point is (8,9), then let's see the sides:\n\nFrom A(5,3) to B(6,8): vector (1,5)\n\nFrom B(6,8) to C(7,4): vector (1,-4)\n\nFrom C(7,4) to D(8,9): vector (1,5)\n\nFrom D(8,9) to A(5,3): vector (-3,-6)\n\nWait, so sides AB and CD are both (1,5), which are equal and parallel. Sides BC and DA are (1,-4) and (-3,-6). Wait, are they parallel? Let's check if (1,-4) is a scalar multiple of (-3,-6). The ratio of the components: -3/-4 = 3/4, and -6/-6=1. Not the same. So they are not parallel. Hmm, that's a problem. So according to this, BC and DA are not parallel. But in a parallelogram, opposite sides must be parallel. So that would mean this is not a parallelogram? But we know the diagonals bisect each other, so according to the midpoint rule, it should be a parallelogram. What's going on here?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the order of the vertices. If the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9), then connecting them in order A-B-C-D-A would not form a parallelogram because the sides BC and DA are not parallel. So perhaps the order is different? Maybe the points are not in order around the parallelogram.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides are AB and BC, then CD and DA. Wait, if we take A-B-C-D-A, then sides AB, BC, CD, DA. As we saw, AB is (1,5), BC is (1,-4), CD is (1,5), DA is (-3,-6). Since DA is not parallel to BC, this is not a parallelogram. Therefore, there must be a different order of the vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps the points are arranged such that the sides are AD and DC instead. Let me try another order. Suppose the vertices are A(5,3), D(8,9), C(7,4), B(6,8). Then sides AD: (8-5,9-3)=(3,6). DC: (7-8,4-9)=(-1,-5). CB: (6-7,8-4)=(-1,4). BA: (5-6,3-8)=(-1,-5). Hmm, this also doesn't have opposite sides parallel.\n\nWait, maybe the correct order is A(5,3), B(6,8), D(8,9), C(7,4).", "answer": "17"}

I need to find the value of tan A. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Also, sine is opposite over hypotenuse, and cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So tan A would be sin A divided by cos A. Wait, the problem gives me that sin A is 2 times cos A. So if I divide sin A by cos A, that should give me tan A. Let me check that. \n\nGiven: sin A = 2 cos A. If I divide both sides by cos A, I get tan A = 2. Is that right? That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to verify if there's more to it. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. \n\nThe triangle is right-angled at B, so angles A and C are acute angles. Since it's a triangle, the sum of angles A and C is 90 degrees. But I don't know if that's necessary here. The key equation given is sin A = 2 cos A. \n\nLet me recall the identity that tan A = sin A / cos A. So if sin A is 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. So the answer should be 2. \n\nWait, but maybe they want it in fractional form or something? But 2 is already a whole number. Let me just confirm with the definitions. \n\nIn triangle ABC, angle B is 90 degrees, so sides: let's say AB is adjacent to angle A, BC is opposite angle A, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then sin A = BC / AC, cos A = AB / AC, so tan A = BC / AB. According to the problem, BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC). The AC cancels out, so BC / AB = 2, which is tan A. So yes, tan A is 2. \n\nI think that's correct. There's no need for more steps here. The problem directly relates sin A and cos A through the given equation, allowing us to find tan A immediately. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. \n\nJust to double-check, suppose angle A is such that tan A = 2. Then sin A would be 2 / sqrt(1 + (2)^2) = 2 / sqrt(5), and cos A would be 1 / sqrt(5). So sin A is indeed twice cos A, which matches the given equation. Yep, that works. \n\nTherefore, the value of tan A is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\tan A$ is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(\\angle B = 90^\\circ\\), we know that \\(\\sin A = 2 \\cos A\\).

I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14), and then add their a, b, and c values together. Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? But I have to make sure that those points aren't also zeros of the numerator, because then there might be a hole instead of an asymptote. So first, let's factor the denominator.\n\nThe denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me factor that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let's think... 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that works. So the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Wait, let's check: (x + 2)(x - 7) = x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Perfect. So denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7).\n\nSo the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, since those are the values that make the denominator zero, and the numerator at those x-values would be 2*(-2) = -4 and 2*7 = 14, respectively. Neither of those are zero, so yes, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7. So a and b are -2 and 7. Wait, but the problem says \"asymptoty pionовые x=a i x=b\", so they might just want the numbers, not necessarily in order. So a and b are -2 and 7. Depending on how the question wants them added, maybe they just want -2 + 7 = 5. But let's check.\n\nNow, horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So c = 0.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. Wait, that's 5. Let me verify again. Vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7, so a and b are -2 and 7. Adding them gives 5, and c is 0, so total is 5. That seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check the factoring. Original denominator: x² -5x -14. Factored as (x + 2)(x - 7). Let's multiply again: x*x = x², x*(-7) + 2*x = -7x + 2x = -5x, and 2*(-7) = -14. Yes, correct. So denominator factors correctly. And numerator at x = -2 is 2*(-2) = -4, denominator is zero, so vertical asymptote there. Similarly, x =7, numerator is 14, denominator zero. So yes, vertical asymptotes. Horizontal asymptote is 0 because degree of denominator is higher. So sum is 5. Seems straightforward.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we start by factoring the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)\n\\]\n\nThe vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The roots of the denominator are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). Evaluating the numerator at these points confirms they are not zero, so the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). Thus, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a first-degree polynomial and the denominator is a second-degree polynomial. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding these values together:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).", "answer": "5"}
{"original_question": "Oblicz $99^2+99+1$ w pamięci.", "question": "Oblicz $99^2+99+1$ w pamięci.", "response": "Hmm, let me try to figure out how to calculate 99 squared plus 99 plus 1 in my head. So, the expression is 99² + 99 + 1. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that squaring a number close to 100 can be easier if I use some algebraic identity. Like, (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². Since 99 is 1 less than 100, maybe I can write 99 as 100 - 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo, 99² = (100 - 1)². Expanding that, it would be 100² - 2*100*1 + 1². Calculating each term: 100² is 10,000. Then, 2*100*1 is 200. And 1² is 1. So putting it all together, 10,000 - 200 + 1. That should be 10,000 - 200 is 9,800, plus 1 is 9,801. Okay, so 99² is 9,801.\n\nNow, the original expression is 9,801 + 99 + 1. Let's add those step by step. First, 9,801 + 99. Hmm, adding 99 to 9,801. Well, 9,801 + 100 would be 9,901, but since it's 99, that's one less. So 9,901 - 1 = 9,900. So, 9,801 + 99 = 9,900. Then add the remaining 1. So 9,900 + 1 = 9,901.\n\nWait a second, let me check that again. 9,801 + 99 + 1. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to add them. Let's see: 99 and 1 add up to 100. So, 9,801 + 100 = 9,901. Yeah, that's the same result. So, either way, the total is 9,901.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there's another approach. Let me think if there's a pattern here. The expression is x² + x + 1 where x is 99. Wait, is there a formula for x² + x + 1? Hmm, not that I recall immediately. But sometimes, expressions like this can be rewritten. Let me see.\n\nIf I factor x² + x + 1, does that factor nicely? Let me check. The discriminant would be 1² - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the real numbers. So that might not help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that 99² + 99 + 1 is similar to (x³ - 1)/(x - 1). Because x³ - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). So, if x = 99, then (99³ - 1)/(99 - 1) = 99² + 99 + 1. But I don't know if that helps in calculating the value. Maybe, but since I need to compute 99² + 99 + 1, perhaps using this identity would give me 99³ - 1 divided by 98. But calculating 99³ might be more complicated. Let me try both ways and see.\n\nFirst, let's stick with the original method. I already calculated 99² as 9,801. Then adding 99 gives 9,900, then adding 1 gives 9,901. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula: 99² + 99 + 1 = (99³ - 1)/(99 - 1) = (99³ - 1)/98. But then I need to compute 99³. Let's see, 99³ is 99*99*99. I can compute 99*99 first, which we already know is 9,801. Then multiply that by 99. So 9,801*99. Hmm, how can I compute that?\n\nAgain, breaking it down: 9,801*100 = 980,100. Then subtract 9,801. So 980,100 - 9,801. Let's do that subtraction. 980,100 - 9,800 is 970,300, then subtract 1 more is 970,299. So 99³ is 970,299. Then subtract 1: 970,299 - 1 = 970,298. Then divide by 98: 970,298 ÷ 98. Hmm, this might be a bit tedious.\n\nLet me see if I can simplify 970,298 divided by 98. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 970,298 ÷ 2 = 485,149 and 98 ÷ 2 = 49. So now it's 485,149 ÷ 49. Let's compute that.\n\n49*10,000 = 490,000. 485,149 - 490,000 is -4,851. Hmm, that's negative. Maybe we can do 49*9,800 = 49*(10,000 - 200) = 490,000 - 9,800 = 480,200. Then 485,149 - 480,200 = 4,949. Now, 49*100 = 4,900. So 4,949 - 4,900 = 49. So that's 100 + 1 = 101. So total is 9,800 + 100 + 1 = 9,901. So, 485,149 ÷ 49 = 9,901. Therefore, 99² + 99 + 1 = 9,901. So both methods lead to the same result. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. If I consider 99² + 99 + 1, maybe I can factor it in some way. Let's see. Let me treat it as a quadratic in x: x² + x + 1. But as I thought earlier, it doesn't factor nicely. However, if I add and subtract something, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that 99² + 99 + 1 = 99² + 99 + 1 = (99² + 99) + 1 = 99*(99 + 1) + 1 = 99*100 + 1 = 9,900 + 1 = 9,901. Oh! That's a much simpler way. Let me verify that.\n\nSo, 99*(99 + 1) + 1. Since 99 + 1 is 100, that becomes 99*100 + 1. 99*100 is 9,900. Then add 1, which is 9,901. That's a more straightforward calculation. Why didn't I think of that earlier? Because I was so focused on expanding 99² first. But breaking it down as 99*(99 + 1) + 1 is smarter. That's clever. So, instead of calculating 99² first, factor out the 99.\n\nSo, the key insight here is recognizing that 99² + 99 can be factored as 99*(99 + 1). That simplifies the calculation. Then adding 1 gives the total. That's a useful technique. So, in general, when you have a term like x² + x + 1, if you can factor x out of the first two terms, you get x(x + 1) + 1. Which, if x is a number like 99, that might make the multiplication easier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9,901. Let me just confirm once more with another method. Let's compute 99² + 99 + 1 directly without factoring.\n\n99 squared is 9,801. Then 9,801 + 99. Let's compute 9,801 + 99: 9,801 + 100 = 9,901, subtract 1 to get 9,900. Then add 1: 9,900 + 1 = 9,901. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I use column addition:\n\n```\n  9,801\n+   99\n+    1\n-------\n```\n\nAdding the units place: 1 + 9 + 1 = 11. Write down 1, carry over 1.\n\nAdding the tens place: 0 + 9 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\n\nAdding the hundreds place: 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 9. Write down 9.\n\nAdding the thousands place: 9 + 0 = 9. Write down 9.\n\nSo the total is 9,901. That matches. So all methods lead to the same answer. I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9,901. I don't think I made any mistakes here. All the different approaches confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that 99² + 99 + 1 equals 9,901.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{9901}\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(99^2 + 99 + 1\\) mentally, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Recognize that \\(99^2\\) can be expanded using the algebraic identity \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) where \\(a = 100\\) and \\(b = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\n   \\]\n\n2.

Hmm, I remember that this kind of problem is related to operator norms. The smallest C here would be the operator norm of the matrix, right? The operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm, which is the maximum of ||Ax|| / ||x|| over all non-zero vectors x. So, essentially, I need to find the maximum value of the ratio ||Ax|| / ||x|| as x varies over all non-zero vectors in R². Then that maximum value is the minimal C that satisfies the inequality.\n\nLet me recall how to compute the operator norm. For a matrix A, the operator norm ||A|| is equal to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of AᵀA. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If the matrix is real and symmetric, then its operator norm is the largest absolute value of its eigenvalues. But in general, for any matrix, the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of AᵀA. Yeah, that seems right. So first, I need to compute AᵀA, find its eigenvalues, take the square root of the largest one, and that should give me the operator norm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this. Let me think. If I parametrize the vector v as [x; y], then compute ||Ax|| in terms of x and y, then maximize ||Ax|| / ||x||. Maybe that's more straightforward?\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's suppose that v is a vector [x; y]. Then, the matrix-vector product Av is:\n\n[2x + 3y; -2y]\n\nSo the norm squared of Av is (2x + 3y)² + (-2y)². Let's compute that:\n\n(2x + 3y)² + ( -2y )² = 4x² + 12xy + 9y² + 4y² = 4x² + 12xy + 13y².\n\nThe norm squared of v is x² + y². Therefore, the ratio squared is (4x² + 12xy + 13y²)/(x² + y²). To find the maximum of this ratio, we can use calculus or maybe diagonalize the quadratic form.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a ratio of quadratic forms, we can consider it as (v^T A^T A v) / (v^T v). The maximum value of this ratio is the largest eigenvalue of A^T A. So maybe going back to the eigenvalues approach is better.\n\nLet me compute A^T A. The original matrix A is:\n\n[2  3]\n\n[0 -2]\n\nSo A^T is:\n\n[2  0]\n\n[3 -2]\n\nThen A^T A is:\n\n[2*2 + 0*0, 2*3 + 0*(-2)]\n\n[3*2 + (-2)*0, 3*3 + (-2)*(-2)]\n\nWait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication: A^T is a 2x2 matrix, and A is 2x2. So A^T A is:\n\nFirst row of A^T: [2, 0]\n\nSecond row of A^T: [3, -2]\n\nMultiply by A: [2, 0] * [2, 3; 0, -2] = [2*2 + 0*0, 2*3 + 0*(-2); 3*2 + (-2)*0, 3*3 + (-2)*(-2)]\n\nCompute each entry:\n\nFirst row, first column: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4\n\nFirst row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6\n\nSecond row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6\n\nSecond row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nTherefore, A^T A is:\n\n[4  6]\n\n[6 13]\n\nNow, to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The characteristic equation is det(A^T A - λI) = 0.\n\nSo determinant of:\n\n[4 - λ   6      ]\n\n[6     13 - λ ]\n\nWhich is (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 6*6 = 0\n\nCompute that:\n\n(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = 0\n\nMultiply out (4 - λ)(13 - λ):\n\n= 4*13 - 4λ -13λ + λ² - 36\n\n= 52 - 17λ + λ² - 36\n\n= λ² -17λ + 16\n\nSo the equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0\n\nSolve for λ:\n\nλ = [17 ± sqrt(17² - 4*1*16)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n17² = 289\n\n4*1*16 = 64\n\nSo sqrt(289 - 64) = sqrt(225) = 15\n\nThus, λ = [17 ±15]/2\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are:\n\n(17 +15)/2 = 32/2 = 16\n\n(17 -15)/2 = 2/2 =1\n\nSo the eigenvalues of A^T A are 16 and 1. Therefore, the singular values of A are sqrt(16) =4 and sqrt(1) =1. Therefore, the operator norm ||A|| is the maximum of these, which is 4. Therefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because if the operator norm is 4, then ||Ax|| <= 4||x|| for all x, and 4 is the smallest such constant. So the answer would be 4.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's parametrize the vector v as [x; y]. Then, the ratio ||Ax|| / ||x|| is sqrt( (4x² +12xy +13y²) ) / sqrt(x² + y²). To maximize this, we can maximize the square of the ratio: (4x² +12xy +13y²)/(x² + y²). Let's set t = y/x, assuming x ≠0. Then, substituting y = tx, the expression becomes (4x² +12x*(tx) +13*(tx)^2)/(x² + (tx)^2) = (4 +12t +13t²)/(1 + t²). Let's call this function f(t) = (13t² +12t +4)/(t² +1). We need to find the maximum of f(t) over real numbers t.\n\nTo find the maximum, take derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set to zero.\n\nf'(t) = [ (26t +12)(t² +1) - (13t² +12t +4)(2t) ] / (t² +1)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: (26t +12)(t² +1) =26t³ +26t +12t² +12\n\nSecond term: (13t² +12t +4)(2t) =26t³ +24t² +8t\n\nSubtract second term from first term:\n\n[26t³ +26t +12t² +12] - [26t³ +24t² +8t] = (26t³ -26t³) + (12t² -24t²) + (26t -8t) +12 = -12t² +18t +12\n\nSet numerator equal to zero:\n\n-12t² +18t +12 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n12t² -18t -12 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n2t² -3t -2 =0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\nt = [3 ± sqrt(9 +16)] /4 = [3 ± sqrt(25)] /4 = [3 ±5]/4\n\nTherefore, t = (3 +5)/4 =8/4=2, or t=(3 -5)/4= -2/4= -1/2\n\nSo critical points at t=2 and t=-1/2. Now, compute f(t) at these points.\n\nFirst, t=2:\n\nf(2) = (13*(4) +12*2 +4)/(4 +1) = (52 +24 +4)/5 =80/5=16.\n\nThen, t=-1/2:\n\nf(-1/2) = (13*(1/4) +12*(-1/2) +4)/(1/4 +1) = (13/4 -6 +4)/(5/4) = (13/4 -2)/(5/4) = (13/4 -8/4)/(5/4) =5/4 /5/4=1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of f(t) is 16, and the minimum is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of ||Ax||/||x|| is sqrt(16)=4. Wait, hold on. Wait, f(t) is the square of the ratio, which is (||Ax||/||x||)^2. So f(t)=16 gives that the ratio squared is 16, so the ratio is 4. Similarly, the minimum ratio squared is 1, so the ratio is 1. Therefore, the maximum ratio is 4, which matches the previous result from the eigenvalues. Therefore, the minimal C is 4.\n\nBut let me check with specific vectors. For example, take a vector v such that y/x=2. Let's take x=1, y=2. Then v=[1;2]. Compute Av:\n\n[2*1 +3*2; 0*1 + (-2)*2] = [2 +6; 0 -4] = [8; -4]. The norm of Av is sqrt(8² + (-4)^2)=sqrt(64 +16)=sqrt(80)=4*sqrt(5). The norm of v is sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). Therefore, ||Av|| / ||v||=4*sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)=4. So that's exactly 4. Similarly, take another vector where the ratio is 1. For example, take t=-1/2, so y=-1/2 x. Let’s take x=2, y=-1. Then v=[2;-1]. Compute Av:\n\n[2*2 +3*(-1); 0*2 + (-2)*(-1)] = [4 -3; 0 +2] = [1; 2]. The norm of Av is sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). The norm of v is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So ||Av|| / ||v||=sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)=1. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the maximum ratio is indeed 4, so the minimal C is 4. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{4}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest positive real number \\( C \\) is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive real number \\( C \\) such that \n\n\\[\n\\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\bold{v} \\right\\| \\le C \\|\\bold{v}\\|\n\\]\n\nfor all two-dimensional vectors \\( \\bold{v} \\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).

{"original_question": "Jaka jest wartość $1^{(2^{235423523})}$?", "question": "Jaka jest wartość $1^{(2^{235423523})}$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\). Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic exponent rules. I remember that any number raised to any power is just that number multiplied by itself that many times. But 1 is a special case here. Let me think... What happens when you raise 1 to a power? \n\nOh right! 1 raised to any power is always 1. Because no matter how many times you multiply 1 by itself, the result is still 1. For example, \\(1^1 = 1\\), \\(1^2 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\), \\(1^3 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1\\), and so on. So even if the exponent is a huge number like \\(2^{235423523}\\), which is some gigantic power, as long as the base is 1, the result should still be 1. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe there's a trick in the notation? The problem is written as \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\). So that's 1 raised to the power of \\(2^{235423523}\\). The parentheses are important here. If it were \\( (1^2)^{235423523} \\), then that would be different, but no, the exponent is all on 2. \n\nAnother way to think about it: exponents are right-associative, so \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\) is equivalent to \\(1\\) multiplied by itself \\(2^{235423523}\\) times. But since each time we multiply by 1, the result doesn't change. So even after multiplying 1 by itself a million times, billion times, trillion times, it's still just 1. \n\nLet me check with smaller exponents to confirm. For instance, \\(1^1 = 1\\), \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(1^3 = 1\\), \\(1^{10} = 1\\), and so on. No matter how large the exponent is, positive integer or otherwise (as long as it's a real number exponent, but in this case, the exponent is an integer). So even if the exponent is a gigantic number like \\(2^{235423523}\\), which is definitely a positive integer, \\(1\\) raised to that power is still \\(1\\). \n\nTherefore, I don't think there's any trick here. The answer should be straightforward. But let me just verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could argue that the expression is ambiguous, but in standard mathematical notation, parentheses are used to clarify the order of operations. Here, the exponent is clearly \\(2^{235423523}\\), so the parentheses around that part indicate that the exponent is all of that. So there's no confusion here. \n\nAnother angle: properties of exponents. Remember that \\(a^{b^c} = a^{(b^c)}\\), which is different from \\((a^b)^c = a^{(b \\cdot c)}\\). Here, the problem is written as \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\), so the exponent is \\(2^{235423523}\\), not \\((2^{235423523})\\) multiplied by itself something. So yes, the parentheses are correctly placed. \n\nTherefore, applying the exponentiation rule: \\(1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1 \\times 1 \\times \\dots \\times 1\\) (with \\(2^{235423523}\\) terms). Since multiplication is associative and the multiplicative identity is 1, the result is 1. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any loopholes here. Even with such a massive exponent, the base is 1, so the result remains 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\), we start by recalling the fundamental property of exponents: any number raised to any power remains 1 if the base is 1. This is because multiplying 1 by itself any number of times will always result in 1. \n\nFor example:\n- \\(1^1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^2 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^3 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nThis pattern holds for any exponent, even a very large one. Here, the exponent is \\(2^{235423523}\\), which is a massive positive integer, but regardless of its size, multiplying 1 by itself \\(2^{235423523}\\) times will still result in 1. \n\nThus, the value of \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "1"}

The problem is about a complex number z such that z^5 = 1 and z ≠ 1. We need to compute the value of the expression z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Hmm, roots of unity, right? Since z^5 = 1, z is a 5th root of unity. But since z ≠ 1, it must be one of the primitive 5th roots.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation z^5 - 1 = 0. These can be written using Euler's formula as e^(2πik/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Since z ≠ 1, k is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So z can be e^(2πi/5), e^(4πi/5), e^(6πi/5), or e^(8πi/5). \n\nNow, the expression we need to compute is z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Let's see. Since z^5 = 1, 1/z is just z^4, because z^5 = 1 implies that 1/z = z^4. Similarly, 1/z² would be z^3. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf z^5 = 1, then z^k = z^(k mod 5). So 1/z = z^(-1) = z^(5 - 1) = z^4. Similarly, 1/z² = z^(-2) = z^(5 - 2) = z^3. Therefore, the expression becomes z + z^4 + z² + z^3. \n\nSo, z + z² + z³ + z⁴. Hmm. Wait, but the sum of all 5th roots of unity is 0. The roots are 1, z, z², z³, z⁴, so 1 + z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = 0. Therefore, z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for exactly that sum: z + 1/z + z² + 1/z². Which we just converted to z + z² + z³ + z⁴. But according to the sum of roots, that's -1. So is the answer -1?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. If z^5 = 1, then the sum 1 + z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = 0. Therefore, subtracting 1 from both sides gives z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. So yes, the expression given in the problem is exactly z + z² + z³ + z⁴, which equals -1. Therefore, the answer is -1. But let me verify this with an example.\n\nTake z = e^(2πi/5). Then 1/z = e^(-2πi/5) = e^(8πi/5) = z⁴. Similarly, z² = e^(4πi/5), 1/z² = e^(-4πi/5) = e^(6πi/5) = z³. So z + 1/z + z² + 1/z² = z + z⁴ + z² + z³ = z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. So that works. Similarly, if z = e^(4πi/5), then 1/z = e^(-4πi/5) = e^(6πi/5) = z³, and 1/z² = e^(-8πi/5) = e^(-8πi/5 + 10πi/5) = e^(2πi/5) = z. So again, the sum is z + z² + z³ + z⁴ = -1. So yes, regardless of which z we pick (excluding 1), the sum is -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\( z \\) such that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we need to compute the value of the expression \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\( z \\) is a primitive 5th root of unity.

Hmm, let me think. Subtraction in different bases can be tricky, but I remember that the principles are similar to base 10, except that when borrowing, instead of 10, we borrow from the next higher place value, which is 9 in this case. Let me start by writing down the numbers vertically to align the digits properly.\n\nSo, 58_9 minus 18_9. Let me line them up:\n\n  5 8\n- 1 8\n-------\n\nNow, since we're working in base 9, each digit represents powers of 9. The rightmost digit is the units place (9^0), then moving left, it's 9^1, and so on. So, the rightmost digits are 8 (from both numbers) and 8 again. Let's start subtracting from the rightmost digit.\n\nFirst, subtract the units place: 8_9 - 8_9. In base 10, this is 8 - 8 = 0. So, the units place of the result is 0. But since we're in base 9, we can just write 0 here. So far, we have:\n\n   5 8\n - 1 8\n  -------\n    0\n\nNow, moving to the next digit to the left, which is the 9^1 place. Here, we have 5_9 - 1_9. In base 10, that's 5 - 1 = 4. So, the next digit is 4. Putting that together, the result should be 40_9. Wait, let me check if that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I should verify by converting both numbers to base 10, performing the subtraction, and then converting back to base 9 to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet's convert 58_9 to base 10. The rightmost digit is 8*9^0 = 8*1 = 8. The leftmost digit is 5*9^1 = 5*9 = 45. So, 45 + 8 = 53 in base 10.\n\nNow, 18_9 in base 10: 1*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 9 + 8 = 17 in base 10.\n\nSubtracting 17 from 53 gives 53 - 17 = 36 in base 10.\n\nNow, converting 36 back to base 9. To do this, divide 36 by 9. 9*4=36, so the quotient is 4 with a remainder of 0. So, 36 in base 9 is 40_9. That matches the result I got earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me go through the subtraction process again step by step to make sure. Sometimes when borrowing, it's easy to mix up the digits.\n\nStarting with the units place: 8_9 - 8_9. That's 0, as before. Then the next digit: 5_9 - 1_9. That's 4_9, so no problem. So the result is 40_9. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where borrowing is needed? Let me think. For example, if the subtrahend digit is larger than the minuend digit. But in this case, both digits are 8 and 8 in the units place, so no borrowing needed there. Then, moving to the next digit: 5 - 1, which is 4, so again, no borrowing. So, yeah, seems like straightforward subtraction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another example. Suppose we have 58_9 - 18_9. If I convert both numbers to base 10, subtract, and convert back, as I did earlier, it's 53 -17 = 36, which is 40_9. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 40_9. Wait, but let me just confirm once more. Maybe I can add 18_9 and 40_9 to see if I get 58_9. Let's try that.\n\nAdding 18_9 and 40_9. Let's do it in base 9. Starting from the rightmost digit: 8 + 0 = 8. Then the next digit: 1 + 4 = 5. So, 58_9. That works. Perfect, that confirms that 18_9 + 40_9 = 58_9, so subtraction is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40_9. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the steps. So, confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) is \\boxed{40_9}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) and express the answer in base 9, we start by aligning the numbers vertically:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c}\n  & 5 \\, 8_9 \\\\\n- & 1 \\, 8_9 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we subtract the units place: \\(8_9 - 8_9\\). In base 10, this is \\(8 - 8 = 0\\), so the units place of the result is 0.\n\nNext, we subtract the next digit (the 9^1 place): \\(5_9 - 1_9\\). In base 10, this is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\), so the result here is 4.\n\nPutting these together, we get \\(40_9\\).\n\nTo verify, we convert both numbers to base 10:\n- \\(58_9\\) converts to \\(5 \\times 9 + 8 = 53_{10}\\).\n- \\(18_9\\) converts to \\(1 \\times 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\\).\n\nSubtracting these gives \\(53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\\). Converting 36 back to base 9, we get \\(40_9\\).\n\nFinally, adding \\(18_9\\) and \\(40_9\\) confirms the result:\n- \\(18_9 + 40_9 = 58_9\\).\n\nThus, the result of \\(58_9 - 18_9\\) is \\(\\boxed{40_9}\\).", "answer": "40_9"}

Let me write that out: \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}\\). The second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). So now the entire expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\).\n\nHmm, both terms have denominators involving \\(\\cos x\\), but the first one also has a \\(\\sin x\\) in the denominator. Maybe I can get a common denominator here. The denominators are \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). So the common denominator would be \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\). Let me adjust the second term accordingly.\n\nThe second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). To get the denominator to \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\), I need to multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sin x\\). So that becomes \\(\\frac{\\sin x \\cdot \\sin x}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). \n\nSo now the entire expression is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). Since the denominators are the same, I can combine them into a single fraction: \\(\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\). \n\nWait, \\(1 - \\sin^2 x\\) is a familiar identity. It's equal to \\(\\cos^2 x\\). So substituting that in, the numerator becomes \\(\\cos^2 x\\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n\nSimplifying the fraction, \\(\\cos^2 x\\) divided by \\(\\cos x\\) is \\(\\cos x\\), so we have \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\). And \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\) is the cotangent of x, which is \\(\\cot x\\). \n\nSo putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to \\(\\cot x\\). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Start with \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\).\n2. Replace \\(\\sec x\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\): \\(\\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\).\n3. Simplify the first term to \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n4. Adjust the second term to have the same denominator: \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n5. Combine the fractions: \\(\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n6. Use the identity \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\): \\(\\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\\).\n7. Simplify to \\(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\\).\n\nEverything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in the algebraic manipulations or trigonometric identities applied. So the simplified form of the given expression is indeed \\(\\cot x\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\cot x}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), we start by using trigonometric identities. \n\n1. Recall that \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\). Substituting this into the first term, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second term is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\). To combine the terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) is \\(\\cos x \\sin x\\).

Combining the fractions, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n   \\]\n\n4. Using the Pythagorean identity \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\), the numerator becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplifying the fraction, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{\\cot x}\\).", "answer": "\\cot x"}

The problem is in Polish, but the translation is given. Let me parse the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states: \"Dziesiąt treelich waž tyle же co trzy squigи i один goolee.\" So, translating that: \"Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee.\" So, 10 treeks = 3 squigs + 1 goolee. Let me note that as equation (1): 10T = 3S + G, where T is treek, S is squig, and G is goolee.\n\nThen, the second part: \"Dwa treeki i один goolee są równe wagа peninsula one squig.\" Translating: \"Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig.\" So, 2T + G = S. Let me note that as equation (2): 2T + G = S.\n\nThe question is: \" engruzna waga ilu treek jest równa wadze jednego squiga?\" Which translates to: \"What number of treeks would weigh the same as one squig?\" So, we need to find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig. So, find S in terms of T, or maybe express S as some multiple of T. Since we have two equations, we can probably solve for S in terms of T.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1) 10T = 3S + G\n\n2) 2T + G = S\n\nWe need to find S = ? T\n\nSo, maybe we can substitute G from equation (2) into equation (1). Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (2): G = S - 2T\n\nSubstitute that into equation (1):\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplify the right side: 3S + S - 2T = 4S - 2T\n\nSo, equation becomes: 10T = 4S - 2T\n\nBring all terms to the left side: 10T + 2T - 4S = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to: 12T - 4S = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 3T - S = 0\n\nSo, 3T = S\n\nTherefore, S = 3T\n\nWait, so that means one squig is equal to three treeks. Therefore, the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig is 3. So, the answer is 3?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me verify this with the equations.\n\nIf S = 3T, then let's check equation (2): 2T + G = S => 2T + G = 3T => G = 3T - 2T = T. So, G = T.\n\nThen equation (1): 10T = 3S + G. Substitute S = 3T and G = T: 10T = 3*(3T) + T => 10T = 9T + T => 10T = 10T. Which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, this checks out. Therefore, one squig is equal to three treeks. Therefore, the answer is 3. So, three treeks weigh the same as one squig.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nStarting with equation (2): G = S - 2T. Then substitute into equation (1):\n\n10T = 3S + G => 10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSo, 10T = 3S + S - 2T => 10T + 2T = 4S => 12T = 4S => 3T = S. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, S = 3T. So, one squig is three treeks. Therefore, the answer is 3. That seems right.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's assign some numbers. Suppose a treek is 1 unit weight. Then a squig would be 3 units, and a goolee would be 1 unit as per above (since G = T). Then check equation (1): 10 treeks = 10*1 = 10. Three squigs and one goolee: 3*3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. Correct. Equation (2): 2 treeks + 1 goolee = 2*1 + 1 = 3, which is equal to one squig (3). Correct. So, all equations hold. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. Let's translate the given information into mathematical equations:\n\n1. \"Dziesiąt treelich waž tyle же co trzy squigи i один goolee\" translates to:\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n   where \\( T \\) is the weight of a treek, \\( S \\) is the weight of a squig, and \\( G \\) is the weight of a goolee.\n\n2. \"Dwa treeki i один goolee są równe wagа one squig\" translates to:\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\nWe need to find the number of treeks that equal the weight of one squig. Let's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, from the second equation, express \\( G \\) in terms of \\( T \\) and \\( S \\):\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( G \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n10T + 2T = 4S\n\\]\n\\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\\[\n3T = S\n\\]\n\nThus, one squig (\\( S \\)) is equal to three treeks (\\( T \\)).

I need to find the sum of a and b. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, which is also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but here we have quadratics, so it's a bit more involved. The product of two quadratics (degree 2) will be a quartic polynomial (degree 4), which matches the given result. So, the coefficients of the resulting polynomial should match when we expand the product of the two given quadratics.\n\nLet me write down the multiplication step by step. Let's denote the first quadratic as (3t² + 5t + a) and the second one as (4t² + bt - 2). To multiply them, I need to distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial.\n\nStarting with the first term of the first polynomial, 3t², multiplying by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴\n\n3t² * bt = 3b t³\n\n3t² * (-2) = -6t²\n\nNext, the second term of the first polynomial, 5t:\n\n5t * 4t² = 20t³\n\n5t * bt = 5b t²\n\n5t * (-2) = -10t\n\nThen, the third term of the first polynomial, a:\n\na * 4t² = 4a t²\n\na * bt = ab t\n\na * (-2) = -2a\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\n12t⁴ + 3b t³ -6t² + 20t³ + 5b t² -10t + 4a t² + ab t -2a\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. Let's group terms by their degree:\n\n- The t⁴ term: 12t⁴\n\n- The t³ terms: 3b t³ + 20t³ = (3b + 20) t³\n\n- The t² terms: -6t² + 5b t² + 4a t² = (-6 + 5b + 4a) t²\n\n- The t terms: -10t + ab t = (-10 + ab) t\n\n- The constant term: -2a\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded polynomial is:\n\n12t⁴ + (3b + 20) t³ + (-6 + 5b + 4a) t² + (-10 + ab) t -2a\n\nAccording to the problem, this should be equal to 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding terms.\n\nLet's write down each equation:\n\n1. Coefficient of t⁴: 12 = 12. That's already matching, so no equation here.\n\n2. Coefficient of t³: 3b + 20 = 26\n\n3. Coefficient of t²: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\n4. Coefficient of t: -10 + ab = -16\n\n5. Constant term: -2a = 6\n\nSo, now we have a system of equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3b + 20 = 26\n\nEquation 2: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\nEquation 3: -10 + ab = -16\n\nEquation 4: -2a = 6\n\nLet me solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with Equation 4: -2a = 6. Solving for a:\n\nDivide both sides by -2: a = 6 / (-2) = -3\n\nSo, a = -3. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, plug a = -3 into Equation 1: 3b + 20 = 26\n\nWait, Equation 1 was 3b + 20 = 26. But Equation 4 gives a = -3, but Equation 1 is for t³ term. Let me check which equations correspond to which terms again.\n\nWait, no. Equation 1 is for the t³ term: 3b + 20 = 26. That's separate from the constant term. So, even though we found a from Equation 4, we can use that in other equations.\n\nSo, a = -3. Let's substitute a into the other equations.\n\nEquation 2: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\nSubstituting a = -3:\n\n-6 + 5b + 4*(-3) = -8\n\nCalculate 4*(-3) = -12\n\nSo, -6 -12 + 5b = -8\n\nCombine constants: -18 + 5b = -8\n\nAdd 18 to both sides: 5b = 10\n\nDivide by 5: b = 2\n\nSo, b = 2.\n\nNow, check Equation 3: -10 + ab = -16\n\nWe have a = -3, b = 2. Let's compute ab:\n\nab = (-3)(2) = -6\n\nThen, -10 + (-6) = -16, which matches the given coefficient. So that's correct.\n\nSo, we have a = -3 and b = 2. Therefore, a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the constant term was -2a = 6. If a = -3, then -2*(-3) = 6, which is correct. So that's good.\n\nThen, the t term: -10 + ab = -16. ab is (-3)(2) = -6. Then, -10 + (-6) = -16. Correct.\n\nThe t² term: -6 +5b +4a. With b=2, a=-3:\n\n-6 +5*2 +4*(-3) = -6 +10 -12 = (-6 -12) +10 = -18 +10 = -8. Which matches.\n\nThe t³ term: 3b +20. With b=2: 3*2 +20 =6 +20=26. Correct.\n\nAll equations are satisfied, so a = -3, b = 2, so a + b = -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -1.\n\nBut let me just verify by actually multiplying the polynomials with a=-3 and b=2 and see if we get the given product.\n\nFirst polynomial: 3t² +5t +a = 3t² +5t -3\n\nSecond polynomial: 4t² + bt -2 =4t² +2t -2\n\nMultiply them:\n\n(3t² +5t -3)(4t² +2t -2)\n\nLet's do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3t²*(4t² +2t -2) = 12t⁴ +6t³ -6t²\n\nThen, 5t*(4t² +2t -2) =20t³ +10t² -10t\n\nThen, -3*(4t² +2t -2) = -12t² -6t +6\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n12t⁴ +6t³ -6t² +20t³ +10t² -10t -12t² -6t +6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- t⁴: 12t⁴\n\n- t³: 6t³ +20t³ =26t³\n\n- t²: -6t² +10t² -12t² = (-6 +10 -12)t² = (-8)t²\n\n- t: -10t -6t = -16t\n\n- constants: +6\n\nSo, the product is 12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, the values a=-3 and b=2 are correct, so a + b = -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{-1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-1}\n</think>\n\nGiven the product of two quadratic polynomials \\(3t^2 + 5t + a\\) and \\(4t^2 + bt - 2\\) is \\(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\\), we need to find the value of \\(a + b\\).\n\nFirst, we expand the product of the polynomials:\n\n\\[\n(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding term by term, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&3t^2 \\cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4, \\\\\n&3t^2 \\cdot bt = 3bt^3, \\\\\n&3t^2 \\cdot (-2) = -6t^2, \\\\\n&5t \\cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3, \\\\\n&5t \\cdot bt = 5bt^2, \\\\\n&5t \\cdot (-2) = -10t, \\\\\n&a \\cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2, \\\\\n&a \\cdot bt = abt, \\\\\n&a \\cdot (-2) = -2a.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n\\[\n12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a\n\\]\n\nMatching coefficients with the given polynomial \\(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\\), we get the following equations:\n\n1.

The function is piecewise defined: for x greater than or equal to 'a', it's ax², and for x less than 'a', it's ax + 2a. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the graph mentally. For x ≥ a, it's a quadratic function opening upwards since the coefficient of x² is 'a'. But wait, is 'a' positive or negative? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe we can figure that out. For the function to intersect every horizontal line, it needs to be defined for all real numbers and cover all possible y-values. If 'a' were negative, the quadratic part (ax²) would open downward, but maybe that could cause issues. Let me check.\n\nFor x < a, the function is linear: ax + 2a. Again, if 'a' is negative, this line would have a negative slope and intercept. If 'a' is positive, then the quadratic opens upwards and the line has a positive slope. Hmm. Let's see. Since the function is defined for all x (since for x ≥ a and x < a, it covers all real numbers as long as a is a real number), but we need to ensure that every horizontal line y = k intersects the graph at least once.\n\nSo, the key is that for any k, there must be some x where f(x) = k. Let's consider different cases for k.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the two parts of the function:\n\n1. For x ≥ a: f(x) = ax². If a > 0, this is a parabola opening upwards; if a < 0, it opens downward. The minimum or maximum value at x = a would be f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. Wait, no. Wait, if x ≥ a, then at x = a, f(a) = a*(a)^2 = a³. But if a is positive, then as x increases beyond a, f(x) = ax² increases to infinity. If a is negative, then as x increases beyond a (which is negative), x² becomes positive, so ax² is negative (since a is negative) and increasing (since x² increases). Wait, actually, x² is always positive, so ax² would be negative if a is negative. But as x increases (becomes less negative), x² decreases, so ax² increases. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\n2. For x < a: f(x) = ax + 2a. If a > 0, this is a line with slope a (positive) and y-intercept 2a. If a < 0, slope is negative and intercept is negative. Let's consider both possibilities for a.\n\nBut the problem asks for the largest value of a such that every horizontal line intersects the graph. So probably, we need a > 0? Because if a is negative, maybe the function has gaps. Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, if a is negative, then for x ≥ a (which is a negative number), f(x) = ax². Since a is negative and x² is non-negative, ax² is non-positive. So, the quadratic part for x ≥ a would be non-positive. The linear part for x < a (which is also less than a, so x is even more negative) would be ax + 2a. If a is negative, then ax is negative (since x is negative) and 2a is negative, so ax + 2a is negative. So, the entire function would be negative. But horizontal lines y = k where k is positive would never intersect the graph. Therefore, a cannot be negative. Therefore, a must be positive. So, we can conclude that a > 0.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest a > 0 such that every horizontal line y = k intersects either the quadratic part (x ≥ a) or the linear part (x < a).\n\nSo, we need to ensure that for every real number k, there exists either an x ≥ a with ax² = k, or an x < a with ax + 2a = k.\n\nLet me rephrase this:\n\nFor every k, either:\n\n1. There exists x ≥ a such that ax² = k, or\n\n2. There exists x < a such that ax + 2a = k.\n\nWe need both cases to cover all k. So, the union of the ranges of the two pieces must be all real numbers.\n\nSo, the range of the quadratic part (x ≥ a) is [a³, ∞) if a > 0. Wait, let's check that. If a > 0, then for x ≥ a, f(x) = ax². Since x ≥ a, x² ≥ a², so ax² ≥ a³. So, the range is [a³, ∞). The range of the linear part (x < a) is (-∞, a² + 2a) because as x approaches -∞, ax + 2a approaches -∞ (since a > 0), and at x = a, it's a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, the linear part's range is (-∞, a² + 2a).\n\nTherefore, the entire function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a) ∪ [a³, ∞). For this union to cover all real numbers, the upper part [a³, ∞) must connect with the lower part (-∞, a² + 2a) such that there's no gap. That is, the upper bound of the lower part (a² + 2a) must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the upper part (a³). So:\n\na² + 2a ≥ a³\n\nBecause if a² + 2a is less than a³, there would be a gap between (-∞, a² + 2a) and [a³, ∞), meaning that y-values between a² + 2a and a³ are not covered. Therefore, to have no gap, we need:\n\na³ ≤ a² + 2a\n\nLet's solve this inequality:\n\na³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0\n\nFactor out an 'a':\n\na(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0\n\nNow, factor the quadratic:\n\na² - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1)\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\na(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0\n\nWe need to find the values of a > 0 (since a must be positive) where this inequality holds.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of each factor:\n\n- a is positive (since a > 0)\n- (a - 2): positive when a > 2, negative when a < 2\n- (a + 1): always positive since a > 0\n\nTherefore, the product a(a - 2)(a + 1) is:\n\nFor 0 < a < 2: a (positive) * (negative) * (positive) = negative\nFor a > 2: a (positive) * (positive) * (positive) = positive\nAt a = 2: 2*(0)*(positive) = 0\n\nSo, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0 holds when 0 < a ≤ 2.\n\nBut since a must be positive, the solution is 0 < a ≤ 2.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of a is 2.\n\nWait, but let's verify this. Let's check when a = 2.\n\nFor a = 2, the quadratic part is 2x² for x ≥ 2, and the linear part is 2x + 4 for x < 2.\n\nThe range of the quadratic part is [2*(2)^2, ∞) = [8, ∞). The range of the linear part is (-∞, 2*2 + 4) = (-∞, 8). So, together, the union is (-∞, ∞). Perfect, no gap. So, at a = 2, the function's range is all real numbers. Therefore, every horizontal line y = k intersects the graph at least once.\n\nIf a > 2, say a = 3, then the quadratic part's range is [27, ∞), and the linear part's range is (-∞, 3*2 + 2*3) = (-∞, 6 + 6) = (-∞, 12). So, the gap between 12 and 27 is not covered. Therefore, horizontal lines between 12 and 27 would not intersect the graph. Hence, a cannot be greater than 2.\n\nSimilarly, if a < 2, say a = 1, then the quadratic part's range is [1, ∞), and the linear part's range is (-∞, 1 + 2) = (-∞, 3). So, the union is (-∞, ∞) because 3 > 1. Wait, but hold on. Wait, when a = 1, a³ = 1 and a² + 2a = 1 + 2 = 3. So, the gap between 1 and 3 is not covered. Wait, but according to our previous inequality, when a = 1 (which is in 0 < a < 2), the inequality a³ ≤ a² + 2a holds: 1 ≤ 3, which is true. But in reality, the ranges would be (-∞, 3) and [1, ∞). So, between 1 and 3, there's a gap. Wait, but that contradicts our previous conclusion. Wait, so maybe my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, let's check again. If a = 1, the quadratic part for x ≥ 1 is f(x) = x², which has a minimum at x = 1, so y = 1. The linear part for x < 1 is f(x) = x + 2, which is a line with slope 1, y-intercept 2. At x approaching -infty, f(x) approaches -infty, and at x = 1, it's 1 + 2 = 3. So, the linear part's range is (-infty, 3). The quadratic part's range is [1, infty). Therefore, the union is (-infty, 3) ∪ [1, infty) which is actually (-infty, infty) because [1, 3) overlaps with (-infty, 3). Wait, but [1, infty) starts at 1, and (-infty, 3) ends at 3. So between 1 and 3, the quadratic part covers [1, infty), so actually, there is no gap. Wait, but when a = 1, the quadratic part's minimum is at x = 1, which is y = 1, and the linear part's maximum is at x = 1 (but x < 1), so approaching 3. So, the quadratic part starts at 1 and goes up, while the linear part goes from -infty to 3. Therefore, between 1 and 3, the quadratic part is covering [1, infty), but the the linear part is covering up to 3. So, the overlapping region is [1, 3], but the union is (-infty, 3) ∪ [1, ∞) which is (-infty, ∞). Wait, that's correct. So, even when a = 1, the union is all real numbers. So, maybe my initial inequality was wrong.\n\nWait, why? Because when a = 1, the quadratic part's minimum is 1, and the linear part's maximum is 3. So, the quadratic part covers [1, ∞), and the linear part covers (-∞, 3). So, together they cover (-∞, ∞). Therefore, even when a is less than 2, the union is all real numbers. So, why did we have the inequality a³ ≤ a² + 2a?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nIf a = 2, then quadratic part's minimum is a³ = 8, and linear part's maximum is a² + 2a = 4 + 4 = 8. So, both meet at 8. Therefore, the union is (-∞, 8) ∪ [8, ∞) which is all real numbers. So, at a = 2, there's no gap.\n\nBut for a < 2, say a = 1, quadratic part's minimum is 1, linear part's maximum is 3. So, the union is (-∞, 3) ∪ [1, ∞). But [1, ∞) starts at 1, which is less than 3, so the union is (-∞, ∞). Wait, so in this case, even when a < 2, the union is all real numbers. So, why does the inequality a³ ≤ a² + 2a come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the roles. Let me think again. If a < 2, then a³ < a² + 2a. For example, a = 1: 1 < 3. So, the quadratic part's minimum is 1, and the linear part's maximum is 3. Since 1 < 3, the quadratic part's range [1, ∞) and the linear part's range (-∞, 3) overlap between 1 and 3, so the union is (-∞, ∞). But if a > 2, then a³ > a² + 2a. For example, a = 3: 27 > 15. Then, quadratic part's range is [27, ∞), linear part's range is (-∞, 15). So, there's a gap between 15 and 27. Therefore, when a > 2, there is a gap. But when a = 2, a³ = a² + 2a, so they meet exactly at 8. Therefore, for a = 2, the ranges connect at 8, so the union is all real numbers. For a < 2, even though a³ < a² + 2a, the ranges still overlap because [a³, ∞) starts below a² + 2a, and (-∞, a² + 2a) ends at a² + 2a, so their union is all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the critical point is when a³ = a² + 2a, which is when a = 2. So, for a ≤ 2, the union of the ranges is all real numbers, but for a > 2, there is a gap. Therefore, the largest value of a is 2.\n\nBut wait, let's test a = 2. When a = 2, quadratic part is 2x² for x ≥ 2. At x = 2, f", "answer": "2"}

Hmm, let me recall how to convert the general equation of a circle into its standard form. I think it involves completing the square for both x and y terms. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the given equation: x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0. First, I'll group the x terms and y terms together. So, (x² - 10x) + (y² + 6y) + c = 0. Now, I need to complete the square for each of these groups.\n\nFor the x terms: x² - 10x. To complete the square, I take the coefficient of x, which is -10, divide it by 2 to get -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I add and subtract 25. Similarly, for the y terms: y² + 6y. The coefficient of y is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, square it to get 9. So, add and subtract 9 there.\n\nPutting that into the equation: (x² - 10x + 25 - 25) + (y² + 6y + 9 - 9) + c = 0. Let's rearrange the terms: (x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 3)² - 9 + c = 0. Combining the constants: -25 -9 + c = c - 34. So the equation becomes (x - 5)² + (y + 3)² + (c - 34) = 0. Moving the constant term to the other side: (x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = 34 - c.\n\nAh, right. The standard form of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. So, comparing, the radius squared here is 34 - c. We want the radius to be 1, so r² should be 1² = 1. Therefore, 34 - c = 1. Solving for c: c = 34 - 1 = 33. So, c should be 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If c is 33, then the equation becomes (x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = 1. Which is a circle with center (5, -3) and radius 1. Yep, that makes sense. Let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0. Completed the square for x: added 25, subtracted 25. For y: added 9, subtracted 9. Then combined constants: -25 -9 = -34. So, the equation becomes (x-5)² + (y+3)² = 34 -c. Set 34 -c =1 (since radius is 1), so c=33. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the answer is c=33.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( c \\) is \\boxed{33}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\) for which the circle given by the equation \\( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \\) has a radius of 1, we start by converting the equation into its standard form by completing the square.\n\nFirst, group the \\( x \\) terms and \\( y \\) terms:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0\n\\]\n\nComplete the square for the \\( x \\) terms:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x \\quad \\text{becomes} \\quad (x - 5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\nComplete the square for the \\( y \\) terms:\n\\[\ny^2 + 6y \\quad \\text{becomes} \\quad (y + 3)^2 - 9\n\\]\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine the constants:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0\n\\]\n\nRearrange to get the standard form of a circle:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\n\\]\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the circle is given by \\( \\sqrt{34 - c} \\).

So, we have the function f(x) = λx(1 - x), and we need to find all λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists some x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that fixed points of f are solutions to f(x) = x. So, if x is a fixed point, then f(x) = x. But the problem is asking for points x where f(x) ≠ x, but applying f twice brings us back to x. These are sort of \"period-2\" points, right? Like in dynamical systems, period-2 orbits. So, we need to find λ where such period-2 points exist, but no fixed points? Wait, no. Wait, if there's a fixed point, then f(f(x)) = f(x) = x, so if x is a fixed point, then f(f(x)) = x trivially. Therefore, to have f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x, x must not be a fixed point. So, we need period-2 points. So, these are points of period 2 but not fixed points. So, the problem is equivalent to finding λ for which there exists a period-2 point, i.e., a point x such that f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x. Got it.\n\nTo find such λ, we need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x and exclude the fixed points. Let's first compute f(f(x)). Let's write that out.\n\nGiven f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) = λ * f(x) * (1 - f(x)).\n\nSo, substituting f(x) into itself:\n\nf(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)].\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nFirst, compute the product inside:\n\n[λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)].\n\nLet me denote A = λx(1 - x). Then, the product is A * (1 - A).\n\nSo, expanding that:\n\nA - A² = λx(1 - x) - [λx(1 - x)]².\n\nTherefore, f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x) - (λx(1 - x))²].\n\nSo, f(f(x)) = λ²x(1 - x) - λ²x²(1 - x)².\n\nBut maybe it's better to set f(f(x)) = x and then subtract f(x) to exclude fixed points. Let's see:\n\nWe want f(f(x)) = x and f(x) ≠ x.\n\nSo, let's write the equation f(f(x)) = x:\n\nλ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)] = x.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\nλ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)] - x = 0.\n\nLet me expand this step by step. Let me first compute the product inside:\n\nFirst, compute λx(1 - x):\n\nLet me denote that as term1 = λx(1 - x).\n\nThen, 1 - term1 = 1 - λx(1 - x).\n\nTherefore, f(f(x)) = λ * term1 * (1 - term1) = λ * term1 - λ * term1².\n\nSo, f(f(x)) = λ term1 - λ term1².\n\nTherefore, the equation f(f(x)) = x is:\n\nλ term1 - λ term1² - x = 0.\n\nBut term1 = λx(1 - x), so substituting back:\n\nλ [λx(1 - x)] - λ [λx(1 - x)]² - x = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: λ * λx(1 - x) = λ²x(1 - x).\n\nSecond term: -λ * [λ²x²(1 - x)²] = -λ³x²(1 - x)².\n\nThird term: -x.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nλ²x(1 - x) - λ³x²(1 - x)² - x = 0.\n\nLet me factor out x:\n\nx [λ²(1 - x) - λ³x(1 - x)² - 1] = 0.\n\nSo, either x = 0 or the expression in brackets is zero.\n\nBut x = 0 is a fixed point since f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is a fixed point since f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0. So, f(1) = 0, which is not equal to 1 unless λ is something. Wait, if x = 1, then f(1) = 0, which is not 1 unless λ is infinite, which it's not. So, x = 1 is not a fixed point. Wait, but f(1) = 0, so unless 0 = 1, which is not, so x = 1 is not a fixed point either. Wait, but fixed points are solutions to f(x) = x. So, f(x) = x implies λx(1 - x) = x. So, for x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x, getting λ(1 - x) = 1. Therefore, fixed points (other than x = 0) satisfy x = 1 - 1/λ. So, as long as λ ≠ 0, fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/λ. But x must be in [0,1], so 1 - 1/λ must be between 0 and 1. Let's check when that happens.\n\n1 - 1/λ ∈ [0,1] when 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 and 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1.\n\nFirst inequality: 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 ⇒ 1 ≥ 1/λ ⇒ λ ≥ 1.\n\nSecond inequality: 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 ⇒ -1/λ ≤ 0, which is always true for λ > 0. So, for λ ≥ 1, the fixed point x = 1 - 1/λ is in [0,1]. For λ < 1, the only fixed point is x = 0.\n\nTherefore, fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/λ (when λ ≥ 1). So, when solving f(f(x)) = x, we need to exclude these fixed points and find solutions where x ≠ 0, x ≠ 1 - 1/λ (if λ ≥ 1). So, back to the equation:\n\nx [λ²(1 - x) - λ³x(1 - x)² - 1] = 0.\n\nSo, either x = 0 or the expression in the brackets is zero. Since we want x ≠ 0 (because we need f(x) ≠ x, and x = 0 is a fixed point), we need to solve:\n\nλ²(1 - x) - λ³x(1 - x)² - 1 = 0.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nλ²(1 - x) - λ³x(1 - x)² - 1 = 0.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe expand the terms:\n\nFirst term: λ²(1 - x).\n\nSecond term: -λ³x(1 - x)².\n\nThird term: -1.\n\nSo, let's expand the second term:\n\n(1 - x)² = 1 - 2x + x².\n\nTherefore, second term becomes: -λ³x(1 - 2x + x²) = -λ³x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³.\n\nTherefore, the entire equation is:\n\nλ²(1 - x) - λ³x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, let's expand the first term:\n\nλ²(1 - x) = λ² - λ²x.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nλ² - λ²x - λ³x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - (λ²x + λ³x) + λ² - 1 = 0.\n\nFactor x terms:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - x(λ² + λ³) + (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe we can factor this equation or find some roots. Let me check if x = 1 is a root. Let's plug x = 1 into the equation:\n\n-λ³(1)³ + 2λ³(1)² - (λ² + λ³)(1) + (λ² - 1) =\n\n-λ³ + 2λ³ - λ² - λ³ + λ² - 1 = ( -λ³ + 2λ³ - λ³ ) + ( -λ² + λ² ) -1 = 0 + 0 -1 = -1 ≠ 0.\n\nSo, x = 1 is not a root. How about x = 0? We already considered that. The equation is satisfied when x = 0, but we have excluded that. Let's see if there are other roots. Maybe x = (1 - 1/λ)? Wait, but that's the fixed point. Let me check if x = 1 - 1/λ is a root. Let's substitute x = 1 - 1/λ into the equation.\n\nBut first, note that for λ ≥ 1, x = 1 - 1/λ is in [0,1]. Let's substitute x = 1 - 1/λ into the equation:\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - (λ² + λ³)x + (λ² - 1).\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: -λ³x³ = -λ³(1 - 1/λ)^3.\n\nSecond term: 2λ³x² = 2λ³(1 - 1/λ)^2.\n\nThird term: -(λ² + λ³)x = -(λ² + λ³)(1 - 1/λ).\n\nFourth term: λ² - 1.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n-λ³*(1 - 3/λ + 3/λ² - 1/λ³) = -λ³ + 3λ² - 3λ + 1.\n\nSecond term:\n\n2λ³*(1 - 2/λ + 1/λ²) = 2λ³ - 4λ² + 2λ.\n\nThird term:\n\n-(λ² + λ³)*(1 - 1/λ) = -(λ² + λ³) + (λ² + λ³)/λ = -λ² - λ³ + λ + 1.\n\nFourth term:\n\nλ² - 1.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\nFirst term: -λ³ + 3λ² - 3λ + 1\n\nSecond term: +2λ³ -4λ² +2λ\n\nThird term: -λ² - λ³ + λ + 1\n\nFourth term: +λ² -1\n\nAdding them up:\n\n(-λ³ + 2λ³ - λ³) + (3λ² -4λ² -λ² +λ²) + (-3λ +2λ +λ) + (1 +1 -1)\n\nSimplify each group:\n\nFor λ³ terms: (-λ³ +2λ³ -λ³) = 0\n\nFor λ² terms: 3λ² -4λ² -λ² +λ² = (3 -4 -1 +1)λ² = (-1)λ²\n\nFor λ terms: -3λ +2λ +λ = 0\n\nConstants: 1 +1 -1 =1\n\nSo total: -λ² +1\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n-λ² +1 =0 ⇒ λ² =1 ⇒ λ=1 or λ=-1. But λ is between 0 and 4, so λ=1.\n\nBut λ=1 is in our interval. So, when λ=1, x=1 -1/1=0, which is a fixed point. Therefore, when λ=1, the fixed point x=0 is a solution, but we need to exclude fixed points. Therefore, for λ=1, the equation f(f(x))=x has x=0 as a solution, but we are looking for x ≠0.

Hmm, the problem gives me a fraction with trigonometric terms in both the numerator and the denominator. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\ntan θ = [cos5°cos20° + cos35°cos50° - sin5°sin20° - sin35°sin50°] / [sin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°]\n\nAlright, so the numerator and denominator each have four terms. Maybe I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator using some trigonometric identities. Let me recall some identities that might help here.\n\nFirst, there's the product-to-sum identities. For example, cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2 and sin A sin B = [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] / 2. Similarly, sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2 and cos A sin B = [sin(A+B) - sin(A-B)] / 2. Maybe applying these identities will help simplify the expression.\n\nLet me try applying these to each term in the numerator and denominator.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\ncos5°cos20° = [cos(25°) + cos(-15°)] / 2. Since cosine is even, cos(-15°) = cos15°, so this becomes [cos25° + cos15°]/2.\n\ncos35°cos50° = [cos85° + cos(-15°)] / 2. Again, cos(-15°) = cos15°, so this is [cos85° + cos15°]/2.\n\nNext, sin5°sin20° = [cos(15°) - cos(25°)] / 2.\n\nsin35°sin50° = [cos(15°) - cos(85°)] / 2.\n\nSo putting all these into the numerator:\n\n[cos25° + cos15°]/2 + [cos85° + cos15°]/2 - [cos15° - cos25°]/2 - [cos15° - cos85°]/2.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nFirst term: [cos25° + cos15°]/2\n\nSecond term: [cos85° + cos15°]/2\n\nThird term: - [cos15° - cos25°]/2 = [-cos15° + cos25°]/2\n\nFourth term: - [cos15° - cos85°]/2 = [-cos15° + cos85°]/2\n\nNow, combine all four terms:\n\n[cos25 + cos15 + cos85 + cos15 - cos15 + cos25 - cos15 + cos85]/2\n\nWait, let me do this step by step:\n\nFirst term: cos25 + cos15\n\nSecond term: + cos85 + cos15\n\nThird term: - cos15 + cos25\n\nFourth term: - cos15 + cos85\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\ncos25 + cos15 + cos85 + cos15 - cos15 + cos25 - cos15 + cos85\n\nLet's see:\n\ncos25 appears twice: 2cos25\n\ncos15 appears: first term +1, second term +1, third term -1, fourth term -1. So total: 0.\n\ncos85 appears twice: 2cos85\n\nSo altogether: 2cos25 + 0 + 2cos85. So numerator becomes [2cos25 + 2cos85]/2 = cos25 + cos85.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: cos25 + cos15\n\nSecond term: cos85 + cos15\n\nThird term: -cos15 + cos25\n\nFourth term: -cos15 + cos85\n\nAdding them all together:\n\ncos25 + cos15 + cos85 + cos15 - cos15 + cos25 - cos15 + cos85\n\nSo:\n\ncos25 + cos25 = 2cos25\n\ncos15 + cos15 - cos15 - cos15 = 0\n\ncos85 + cos85 = 2cos85\n\nYes, so total is 2cos25 + 2cos85 over 2, which is cos25 + cos85. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the denominator. Let's apply the same product-to-sum identities.\n\nDenominator terms:\n\nsin5°cos20° = [sin(25°) + sin(-15°)] / 2. Since sin(-15°) = -sin15°, this becomes [sin25° - sin15°]/2.\n\nsin35°cos50° = [sin85° + sin(-15°)] / 2 = [sin85° - sin15°]/2.\n\ncos5°sin20° = [sin25° - sin(-15°)] / 2 = [sin25° + sin15°]/2.\n\ncos35°sin50° = [sin85° - sin(-15°)] / 2 = [sin85° + sin15°]/2.\n\nNow, substitute these into the denominator expression:\n\n[sin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°]\n\nTranslating each term:\n\nFirst term: [sin25° - sin15°]/2\n\nSecond term: - [sin85° - sin15°]/2 = [-sin85° + sin15°]/2\n\nThird term: + [sin25° + sin15°]/2\n\nFourth term: - [sin85° + sin15°]/2 = [-sin85° - sin15°]/2\n\nSo, combining all four terms:\n\n[sin25 - sin15 - sin85 + sin15 + sin25 + sin15 - sin85 - sin15]/2\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFirst term: sin25 - sin15\n\nSecond term: -sin85 + sin15\n\nThird term: +sin25 + sin15\n\nFourth term: -sin85 - sin15\n\nCombining all terms:\n\nsin25 - sin15 - sin85 + sin15 + sin25 + sin15 - sin85 - sin15\n\nLet's group like terms:\n\nsin25 + sin25 = 2sin25\n\n-sin15 + sin15 + sin15 - sin15 = 0\n\n-sin85 - sin85 = -2sin85\n\nSo total numerator: 2sin25 - 2sin85. Therefore, denominator becomes [2sin25 - 2sin85]/2 = sin25 - sin85.\n\nWait, so the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°. Hmm, but sin85° is the same as sin(90° - 5°) = cos5°, but maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nSo now we have the original expression simplified to:\n\ntan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this further using sum-to-product identities. Let's recall that:\n\ncos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]\n\nsin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]\n\nSo applying these to numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, numerator: cos25° + cos85°\n\nLet A = 25°, B = 85°, so:\n\n2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°)\n\nSince cosine is even, cos(-30°) = cos30°, so numerator becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.\n\nDenominator: sin25° - sin85°\n\nUsing sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nLet A =25°, B=85°, so:\n\n2 cos[(25 +85)/2] sin[(25 -85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°)\n\nSine is odd, so sin(-30°) = -sin30°, so denominator becomes 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n[2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°] = [cos30°] / [- sin30°] = - cot30°.\n\nBut cot30° is 1/tan30° = √3. So -cot30° = -√3.\n\nTherefore, tanθ = -√3.\n\nBut θ is the smallest positive angle where tanθ = -√3. We need to find θ such that tanθ = -√3. The tangent function has a period of 180°, so the solutions are θ = -60° + 180°k, where k is an integer.\n\nBut since we need the smallest positive angle, we can add 180° to -60° to get 120°. So θ = 120°.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator simplified to cos25 + cos85, which using sum-to-product became 2cos55cos30.\n\nDenominator simplified to sin25 - sin85, which became 2cos55(-sin30).\n\nThus, the ratio is [2cos55cos30]/[2cos55(-sin30)] = cos30/(-sin30) = -cot30.\n\nSince cot30° is √3, so -√3. Therefore, tanθ = -√3. The angle θ where tanθ = -√3 is 120°, since tan(120°) = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So θ = 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.\n\nBut let me confirm if there's a smaller positive angle. Since the period of tangent is 180°, the solutions are θ = 120° - 180°k. For k=0, θ=120°, for k=1, θ= -60°, which is negative. So 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's an alternative approach. Maybe I made an error in simplifying the original expression. Let me verify with actual numerical values.\n\nLet me compute the original expression numerically and see if tanθ is indeed -√3.\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\ncos5°cos20° + cos35°cos50° - sin5°sin20° - sin35°sin50°\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ncos5° ≈ 0.9962\n\ncos20° ≈ 0.9397\n\ncos35° ≈ 0.8192\n\ncos50° ≈ 0.6428\n\nsin5° ≈ 0.0872\n\nsin20° ≈ 0.3420\n\nsin35° ≈ 0.5736\n\nsin50° ≈ 0.7660\n\nNow compute each product:\n\ncos5°cos20° ≈ 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.937\n\ncos35°cos50° ≈ 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.526\n\nsin5°sin20° ≈ 0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0298\n\nsin35°sin50° ≈ 0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.438\n\nSo numerator ≈ 0.937 + 0.526 - 0.0298 - 0.438 ≈ 0.937 + 0.526 = 1.463; 1.463 - 0.0298 = 1.433; 1.433 - 0.438 ≈ 0.995\n\nDenominator:\n\nsin5°cos20° - sin35°cos50° + cos5°sin20° - cos35°sin50°\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsin5°cos20° ≈ 0.0872 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0822\n\n-sin35°cos50° ≈ -0.5736 * 0.6428 ≈ -0.369\n\ncos5°sin20° ≈ 0.9962 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.341\n\n-cos35°sin50° ≈ -0.8192 * 0.7660 ≈ -0.625\n\nSo denominator ≈ 0.0822 - 0.369 + 0.341 - 0.625 ≈ (0.0822 + 0.341) + (-0.369 - 0.625) ≈ 0.4232 - 0.994 ≈ -0.5708\n\nSo the original expression ≈ 0.995 / (-0.5708) ≈ -1", "answer": "120^\\circ"}

Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in that number. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros depends on how many pairs of 2 and 5 there are in the prime factors of 42!. But I also recall that usually there are more 2s than 5s in a factorial's prime factorization, so the number of trailing zeros is actually determined by the number of 5s. So, my task is to count how many times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nLet me think... To count the number of times a prime number p divides n!, you can use the formula: floor(n/p) + floor(n/p²) + floor(n/p³) + ... until the terms become zero. This accounts for the multiples of p, p squared, p cubed, etc., in the factorial. So, for 5 in 42!, it should be floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ... \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: floor(42/5). Let's see, 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so the floor of that is 8.\n\nSecond term: floor(42/25). 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so the floor is 1.\n\nThird term: floor(42/125). 42 divided by 125 is 0.336, so the floor is 0. Since this is zero, we can stop here.\n\nAdding them up: 8 + 1 = 9. So, there should be 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's check each step again.\n\nFirst, dividing 42 by 5. 5 times 8 is 40, which is less than 42, so yes, 8. Then 25 times 1 is 25, which is less than 42, so 1. Then 125 is more than 42, so zero. So, 8 + 1 = 9. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about how many multiples of 5 are there between 1 and 42. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers, right? Because 5*8=40. Then, among these, how many are multiples of 25? Because 25 contributes an extra 5. The multiples of 25 in that range are 25. So, that's 1 number. So, 8 + 1 = 9. Yep, that matches the previous calculation. So, each multiple of 5 gives one 5, and each multiple of 25 gives an additional 5. So, in this case, there's one multiple of 25 (which is 25 itself) contributing an extra 5. So, total number of 5s is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any multiple of higher powers of 5. The next power is 125, which is 5^3, but 125 is greater than 42, so there are no multiples of 125 in 42!. So, no more contributions. Therefore, the total is indeed 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the factorials and count, but that's tedious. But maybe for smaller numbers, like 10!, it's easy. For example, 10! has two trailing zeros. Let's check: 10! = 3628800, which ends with two zeros. According to the formula, floor(10/5) = 2, floor(10/25) = 0, so total 2. Correct. Similarly, 25! should have floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6 trailing zeros. Let me check 25! = 15511210043330985984000000. Wait, actually, I might be misremembering, but 25! is a huge number with many zeros at the end. But the formula gives 6, which is correct. So, the formula seems reliable.\n\nTherefore, applying the same formula to 42! gives 9 trailing zeros. So, the answer should be 9. But just to make sure, let me check another example. Let's take 30!. According to the formula, floor(30/5) = 6, floor(30/25) = 1, floor(30/125) = 0. So, total 7 trailing zeros. Let me check 30! is 265252859812191058636308480000000. The end has seven zeros. Correct. So, the formula works here as well.\n\nTherefore, confident that the formula gives the correct result, so for 42!, it's 8 + 1 = 9. So, the number of trailing zeros is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nWe use the formula for counting the number of times a prime number \\(p\\) divides \\(n!\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nFor \\(42!\\) and \\(p = 5\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8.4 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1.68 \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.336 \\right\\rfloor = 0\n\\]\n\nAdding these values together gives the total number of factors of 5 in \\(42!\\):\n\\[\n8 + 1 + 0 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).", "answer": "9"}

Hmm, let's see. First, I should probably understand what this function looks like and how it behaves within the given domain. \n\nSince both x and y are bounded between -1 and 1, the square roots are defined, which is good. The function is a combination of two terms: the first term is x multiplied by the square root of (1 - y²), and the second term is y multiplied by the square root of (1 - x²). Both terms involve products of variables and square roots, which might suggest some trigonometric substitution could be helpful here. Because square roots of (1 - something squared) make me think of sine and cosine, since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. Maybe substituting x = sinθ and y = sinφ? Let me try that.\n\nLet’s set x = sinθ and y = sinφ where θ and φ are angles between -π/2 and π/2 since the sine function ranges from -1 to 1. Then √(1 - x²) becomes cosθ and √(1 - y²) becomes cosφ. So substituting into f(x, y), we get:\n\nf(θ, φ) = sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ\n\nOh! That simplifies to sin(θ + φ) because of the sine addition formula: sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. So f(θ, φ) = sin(θ + φ). Interesting. So the original function f(x, y) can be rewritten as sin(θ + φ) where x = sinθ and y = sinφ. \n\nNow, to maximize sin(θ + φ), we need to maximize θ + φ because the sine function reaches its maximum at π/2. However, θ and φ are each in the interval [-π/2, π/2], so θ + φ can range from -π to π. The maximum value of sin(θ + φ) occurs when θ + φ = π/2, right? Because sin(π/2) = 1, which is the maximum value of sine. \n\nBut wait, θ and φ can each go up to π/2. If θ = π/2 and φ = π/2, then θ + φ = π, and sin(π) = 0. If θ = π/2 and φ = 0, then θ + φ = π/2, and sin(π/2) = 1. Wait, that seems possible. If θ is π/2, then x = sin(π/2) = 1, and φ is 0, so y = sin(0) = 0. Then f(x, y) = 1*√(1 - 0) + 0*√(1 - 1²) = 1*1 + 0*0 = 1. Similarly, if θ = 0 and φ = π/2, then x = 0 and y = 1, which also gives f(x, y) = 0*√(1 - 1) + 1*√(1 - 0) = 0 + 1 = 1. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where θ + φ is greater than π/2? Let's see. Suppose θ and φ are both positive. The maximum θ + φ can be is π (when both are π/2). But sin(π) = 0. If θ and φ are such that θ + φ is 3π/4, then sin(3π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, which is less than 1. So the maximum of sin(θ + φ) is indeed 1, achieved when θ + φ = π/2. \n\nBut how do we get θ + φ = π/2? Let's solve for θ and φ. If θ + φ = π/2, then φ = π/2 - θ. So substituting back into x and y:\n\nx = sinθ\n\ny = sin(π/2 - θ) = cosθ\n\nSo x and y are related by y = cosθ where x = sinθ. Therefore, x² + y² = sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So this substitution leads us to x² + y² = 1. Wait, but x and y are both in [-1, 1], but their squares sum to 1. So this implies that the maximum occurs when (x, y) lies on the unit circle. But x and y are each between -1 and 1, so the unit circle in the first quadrant would be x and y both positive. If we take θ and φ both positive, then x and y would be positive. So the maximum of 1 is achieved when x and y are on the unit circle in the first quadrant. But is that the only case? Let's check.\n\nSuppose θ + φ = π/2. Then x = sinθ, y = cosθ. So x and y satisfy x² + y² = 1, and both are non-negative if θ and φ are between 0 and π/2. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1, achieved when x and y are such that x² + y² = 1 and x, y ≥ 0. But wait, what if x and y are negative? If x and y are negative, then let's see. Let’s say θ = -π/2 + α and φ = -π/2 + β, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, suppose θ and φ are such that θ + φ = π/2. If θ is in the first quadrant, φ can be in the first or fourth quadrant. Wait, but if θ + φ = π/2, then φ = π/2 - θ. If θ is positive, then φ is positive. If θ is negative, then φ would have to be greater than π/2 to keep θ + φ = π/2. For example, if θ = -π/4, then φ = 3π/4. But φ = 3π/4 is outside the range of the arcsine function, since y = sinφ would be sin(3π/4) = √2/2, which is allowed, but φ would have to be between -π/2 and π/2. Wait, no. If we use the substitution x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then θ and φ are in [-π/2, π/2], but if we set θ + φ = π/2, then φ = π/2 - θ. But θ is in [-π/2, π/2], so φ would be in [ -π/2, 3π/2 ]. However, y = sinφ must be between -1 and 1. So φ is in [-π/2, π/2]. Therefore, if θ is in [-π/2, π/2], then φ = π/2 - θ must also be in [-π/2, π/2]. Let's see. Suppose θ is in [-π/2, π/2]. Then φ = π/2 - θ. Let's find the range of φ. If θ is -π/2, then φ = π/2 - (-π/2) = π. But π is outside the allowed range of φ. Similarly, if θ is π/2, then φ = π/2 - π/2 = 0. Wait, so if θ is in [-π/2, π/2], then φ = π/2 - θ is in [π/2 - (-π/2), π/2 - π/2] = [π, 0]. But φ must be in [-π/2, π/2], so φ cannot be greater than π/2. Therefore, this substitution leads to a contradiction unless θ is such that φ is within [-π/2, π/2]. So maybe θ + φ = π/2 is not possible with both θ and φ in [-π/2, π/2] except when θ and φ are both in [0, π/2]. Because if θ is negative, then φ would have to be greater than π/2, which is not allowed. So perhaps the maximum is achieved when θ and φ are both in [0, π/2], leading to x and y in [0, 1], and x² + y² = 1. So in that case, the maximum value is 1. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Let's take x = y = √2/2. Then x² + y² = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Then f(x, y) = (√2/2)(√(1 - (√2/2)^2)) + (√2/2)(√(1 - (√2/2)^2)). Let's compute √(1 - (√2/2)^2). (√2/2)^2 is 0.5, so 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. So √0.5 = √2/2. Therefore, each term is (√2/2)(√2/2) = (2/4) = 0.5. So f(x, y) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So that works. So when x and y are both √2/2, which are in [0, 1], then f(x, y) = 1. \n\nBut is this the maximum? Let's try another point. Suppose x = 1 and y = 0. Then f(1, 0) = 1*√(1 - 0) + 0*√(1 - 1) = 1*1 + 0*0 = 1. Similarly, if x = 0 and y = 1, f(0, 1) = 0*√(1 - 1) + 1*√(1 - 0) = 0 + 1 = 1. So those points also give f(x, y) = 1. So multiple points achieve the value 1. \n\nBut wait, what if we take x and y such that x = y = 1. Then f(1, 1) = 1*√(1 - 1) + 1*√(1 - 1) = 0 + 0 = 0. That's worse. If we take x = 1 and y = something else, say y = 1/2. Then f(1, 1/2) = 1*√(1 - 1/4) + (1/2)*√(1 - 1) = 1*(√(3)/2) + (1/2)*0 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1. Similarly, if x = √3/2 and y = 1/2, then f(√3/2, 1/2) = (√3/2)*√(1 - 1/4) + (1/2)*√(1 - 3/4) = (√3/2)*(√3/2) + (1/2)*(1/2) = (3/4) + (1/4) = 1. So again, that's 1. So different points can give 1. \n\nBut is there a point where f(x, y) is greater than 1? Let's see. Suppose we take x = √(0.6) and y = √(0.4). Then x² + y² = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1. Then f(x, y) = √0.6 * √(1 - 0.4) + √0.4 * √(1 - 0.6) = √0.6 * √0.6 + √0.4 * √0.4 = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1. So again, 1. It seems like no matter how we choose x and y such that x² + y² = 1, the function f(x, y) equals 1. \n\nWait, so actually, if x and y are on the unit circle, then f(x, y) = 1. But if they are not on the unit circle, does f(x, y) increase or decrease? For example, take x = 0.8 and y = 0.6. Then x² + y² = 0.64 + 0.36 = 1. So again, f(x, y) = 1. If we take x = 0.5 and y = 0.5, then x² + y² = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 < 1. Then f(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5*√(1 - 0.25) + 0.5*√(1 - 0.25) = 0.5*(√0.75) + 0.5*(√0.75) = √0.75 ≈ 0.866 < 1. So in that case, f is less than 1. So it seems like when x and y are on the unit circle, f(x, y) = 1, otherwise, it's less. \n\nBut wait, how is that possible? Let me check another point not on the unit circle. Let's take x = 0.6 and y = 0.8. Then x² + y² = 0.36 + 0.64 = 1, so they are on the unit circle. Then f(x, y) = 0.6*√(1 - 0.64) + 0.8*√(1 - 0.36) = 0.6*√0.36 + 0.8*√0.64 = 0.6*0.6 + 0.8*0.8 = 0.36 + 0.64 = 1. So yes, that's 1. If I take x = 0.7 and y = sqrt(1 - 0.49) ≈ 0.7141. Then f(x, y) = 0.7*sqrt(1 - 0.51) + 0.7141*sqrt(1 - 0.49). Wait, no. Wait, if x = 0.7, then y = sqrt(1 -", "answer": "1"}

The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. O is the origin since the vectors OA and OB are provided, right? Because if O is the origin, then the coordinates of A and B are just the components of those vectors. Let me confirm that. Yeah, in vector problems, unless stated otherwise, O is usually the origin. So OA is the vector from O to A, so A has coordinates (1, 2, 3) and B has coordinates (-3, -2, 1). \n\nAlright, so the triangle is formed by these three points: O(0,0,0), A(1,2,3), and B(-3,-2,1). To find the area of triangle OAB, I remember that one way to calculate the area of a triangle in 3D space is by using the cross product of two vectors that form the sides of the triangle. The formula is half the magnitude of the cross product of those vectors. \n\nSo, first, I need to find two vectors that lie on the triangle. Since the triangle is OAB, the vectors OA and OB are already given. Alternatively, vectors OA and AB could be used. Wait, let me think. If I take vectors OA and OB, then the cross product OA × OB will give a vector perpendicular to both, and its magnitude will be equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. Therefore, half of that magnitude will be the area of the triangle. That sounds right. \n\nSo, let me compute OA × OB. The cross product of two vectors in 3D can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of OA in the second row, and the components of OB in the third row. \n\nGiven OA = (1, 2, 3) and OB = (-3, -2, 1). So setting up the determinant:\n\ni | j | k |\n1 | 2 | 3 |\n-3 | -2 | 1 |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\ni*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))\n\nLet me compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst, the i component: 2*1 = 2, 3*(-2) = -6. So 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8. So the i component is 8i.\n\nThen the j component: It's subtracted, so we have -(1*1 - 3*(-3)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 1*1 = 1, 3*(-3) = -9. So 1 - (-9) = 1 + 9 = 10. Then we have -10j.\n\nNext, the k component: 1*(-2) = -2, 2*(-3) = -6. So -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4. So the k component is 4k.\n\nPutting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). \n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is the square root of (8² + (-10)² + 4²). Let's compute that:\n\n8² = 64, (-10)² = 100, 4² = 16. Adding them up: 64 + 100 = 164, 164 + 16 = 180. So the magnitude is sqrt(180). \n\nSimplify sqrt(180): 180 = 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, the magnitude of the cross product is 6√5. \n\nSince the area of the triangle is half of this magnitude, the area is (6√5)/2 = 3√5. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. \n\nStarting with the cross product:\n\ni component: (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. Correct.\n\nj component: -[(1)(1) - (3)(-3)] = -[1 + 9] = -10. Correct.\n\nk component: (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo cross product is indeed (8, -10, 4). Then magnitude squared is 8² + (-10)^2 + 4² = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. Square root of 180 is sqrt(36*5) = 6√5. Half of that is 3√5. \n\nHmm, seems right. But let me check another way. Maybe using vectors OA and AB? Wait, but if I use OA and AB, AB is B - A, which is (-3 -1, -2 -2, 1 -3) = (-4, -4, -2). Then the cross product of OA and AB would be different. Let me try that to cross-verify.\n\nOA × AB: OA is (1,2,3), AB is (-4, -4, -2). The cross product would be:\n\ni*(2*(-2) - 3*(-4)) - j*(1*(-2) - 3*(-4)) + k*(1*(-4) - 2*(-4))\n\nCalculating each component:\n\ni: 2*(-2) = -4, 3*(-4) = -12. So -4 - (-12) = -4 +12 = 8. So i component 8.\n\nj: - [1*(-2) - 3*(-4)] = - [ -2 +12 ] = - [10] = -10. So j component -10.\n\nk: 1*(-4) = -4, 2*(-4) = -8. So -4 - (-8) = -4 +8 = 4. So k component 4. \n\nSo cross product is (8, -10, 4), same as before. Then magnitude is sqrt(8² + (-10)^2 +4²) = sqrt(64 +100 +16) = sqrt(180) = 6√5. So same result. Therefore, area is 3√5. \n\nTherefore, the area of triangle OAB is 3√5. \n\nAlternatively, another way to check is using the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space with coordinates. If we have three points O(0,0,0), A(x1,y1,z1), B(x2,y2,z2), then the area can be calculated as (1/2) * || OA × OB ||. Which is exactly what I did. So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using Heron's formula? But that might be more complicated. Let's see. For Heron's formula, we need the lengths of all three sides: OA, OB, and AB.\n\nOA is the distance from O to A: sqrt(1² +2² +3²) = sqrt(1 +4 +9) = sqrt(14).\n\nOB is the distance from O to B: sqrt((-3)^2 + (-2)^2 +1^2) = sqrt(9 +4 +1) = sqrt(14). Interesting, both OA and OB have the same length, sqrt(14).\n\nAB is the distance from A to B: sqrt[(-3 -1)^2 + (-2 -2)^2 + (1 -3)^2] = sqrt[(-4)^2 + (-4)^2 + (-2)^2] = sqrt(16 +16 +4) = sqrt(36) = 6.\n\nSo the sides are sqrt(14), sqrt(14), 6. So this is an isoceles triangle with two sides of length sqrt(14) and base 6. \n\nUsing Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s is (sqrt(14) + sqrt(14) +6)/2 = (2sqrt(14) +6)/2 = sqrt(14) +3.\n\nArea = sqrt[ s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ] = sqrt[ (sqrt(14) +3)(sqrt(14) +3 - sqrt(14))(sqrt(14) +3 - sqrt(14))(sqrt(14) +3 -6) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\ns = sqrt(14) +3\n\ns - a = 3\n\ns - b = 3\n\ns - c = sqrt(14) +3 -6 = sqrt(14) -3\n\nTherefore, Area = sqrt[ (sqrt(14)+3)(3)(3)(sqrt(14)-3) ] = sqrt[ 9*( (sqrt(14)+3)(sqrt(14)-3) ) ]\n\nMultiply (sqrt(14)+3)(sqrt(14)-3) = (sqrt(14))^2 -3^2 =14 -9=5\n\nTherefore, Area = sqrt[9*5] = sqrt(45) = 3√5. \n\nWhich matches the previous result. So that's reassuring. So the area is indeed 3√5. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3√5, boxed as \\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of triangle \\(OAB\\) where \\(O\\) is the origin, and the position vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we use the cross product method.\n\n1. **Calculate the cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n   1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n   -3 & -2 & 1\n   \\end{vmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Expanding the determinant:\n   \\[\n   = \\mathbf{i}(2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-2)) - \\mathbf{j}(1 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-3)) + \\mathbf{k}(1 \\cdot (-2) - 2 \\cdot (-3))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \\mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \\mathbf{k}(-2 + 6)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 8\\mathbf{i} - 10\\mathbf{j} + 4\\mathbf{k}\n   \\]\n   So, \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n2. **Find the magnitude of the cross product:**\n   \\[\n   \\|\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB}\\| = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \\sqrt{180} = 6\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB}\\| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle \\(OAB\\) is \\(\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}\\).", "answer": "3 \\sqrt{5}"}

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions the midlines (AD, BE, CF) of triangleABC intersecting at point G. Wait, midlines are usually the lines connecting the midpoints of the sides, right? But midlines themselves are not the lines connecting midpoints; those are midsegments. Alternatively, maybe they mean the medians here? Because medians also connect a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, and they intersect at the centroid, which is point G. The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio.\n\nSo, if AD, BE, and CF are the medians, they all meet at the centroid G. Then, there is a line passing through G that's parallel to BC, intersecting AB at M and AC at N. I need to find the area of triangleENG.\n\nLet me visualize triangleABC. Let's assume it's any triangle, but since the area is given, maybe coordinates would help here. Assign coordinates to the triangle and compute the required points. Alternatively, use ratios and properties of centroids and similar triangles.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when a line is drawn through the centroid parallel to a side, it divides the triangle into smaller regions with certain area ratios. Since the line is parallel to BC and passes through G, which is the centroid, the segment MN should create a smaller triangle similar to ABC.\n\nBut triangleENG is inside triangleABC. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the centroid G divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. So, for example, if we take median AD, then AG:GD = 2:1.\n\nNow, the line MN passes through G and is parallel to BC. Since MN is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC are similar. The ratio of their areas would be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n\nBut where exactly is point M on AB and N on AC? Since MN passes through G, we need to find the ratio of similarity.\n\nAlternatively, since MN is parallel to BC and passes through the centroid, which is located 2/3 of the way along the median from a vertex, the distance from MN to BC would be 1/3 of the height of ABC. Hence, the ratio of similarity would be 1/3, making the area of AMN 1/9 of ABC, which would be 16. But wait, that might not be directly applicable here because MN is not necessarily a midline.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the position of M and N first. Let me try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet's assign coordinates to triangleABC. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). Choosing coordinates with A at the origin and AB along the x-axis might simplify things. Then, the centroid G would be the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. So, G's coordinates would be ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).\n\nNow, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. Let's find the equation of line BC first. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b). Therefore, the line MN, being parallel to BC, will have the same slope d/(c - b).\n\nThe equation of line MN can be written using point-slope form. Since it passes through G((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3), the equation is:\n\ny - (2d)/3 = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nNow, we need to find where this line intersects AB and AC.\n\nFirst, let's find point M on AB. Since AB is from (0,0) to (2b, 0), it's along the x-axis. So, y = 0. Let's substitute y = 0 into the equation of MN:\n\n0 - (2d)/3 = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nSolving for x:\n\n- (2d)/3 = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nMultiply both sides by (c - b)/d:\n\n- (2/3)(c - b) = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nThen,\n\nx = - (2/3)(c - b) + (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ -2(c - b) + 2b + 2c ] / 3\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n-2c + 2b + 2b + 2c = (-2c + 2c) + (2b + 2b) = 0 + 4b = 4b\n\nTherefore, x = 4b / 3\n\nSo, point M is at (4b/3, 0)\n\nSimilarly, let's find point N on AC. AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). The equation of AC can be parametrized. Let me find its equation. The slope from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d) is (2d - 0)/(2c - 0) = d/c. So, the equation is y = (d/c)x.\n\nNow, the line MN has the equation y - (2d)/3 = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3). Let's find the intersection point N between MN and AC.\n\nSubstitute y = (d/c)x into the equation of MN:\n\n(d/c)x - (2d)/3 = [d/(c - b)](x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nMultiply both sides by (c - b)/d to eliminate denominators:\n\n[(c - b)/d] * (d/c)x - [(c - b)/d] * (2d)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(c - b)/c]x - [2(c - b)/3] = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nMultiply through by 3c to eliminate denominators:\n\n3(c - b)x - 2c(c - b) = 3c x - c(2b + 2c)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n3(c - b)x - 2c(c - b) = 3c x - 2c(b + c)\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n3(c - b)x - 2c(c - b) - 3c x + 2c(b + c) = 0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n3(c - b)x - 3c x - 2c(c - b) + 2c(b + c) = 0\n\nFactor x terms:\n\n3x[(c - b) - c] + (-2c(c - b) + 2c(b + c)) = 0\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(c - b - c) = -b\n\nFor the constant terms:\n\n-2c(c - b) + 2c(b + c) = -2c^2 + 2bc + 2bc + 2c^2 = (-2c^2 + 2c^2) + (2bc + 2bc) = 0 + 4bc = 4bc\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n-3b x + 4bc = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n-3b x = -4bc => x = (4c)/3\n\nThen, y = (d/c)x = (d/c)*(4c/3) = 4d/3\n\nTherefore, point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nSo, now we have coordinates for points M(4b/3, 0), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and we need to find the area of triangleENG. But wait, where is point E?\n\nWait, the problem mentions the midlines AD, BE, and CF. So, BE is another median. Let's recall that in triangleABC, the medians are AD, BE, CF. So, point E is the midpoint of AC. Wait, BE connects vertex B to the midpoint of AC. Similarly, CF connects C to the midpoint of AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct my coordinates. If AD, BE, and CF are the medians, then:\n\n- AD is the median from A to midpoint D of BC.\n\n- BE is the median from B to midpoint E of AC.\n\n- CF is the median from C to midpoint F of AB.\n\nTherefore, in my coordinate system:\n\nPoint D is the midpoint of BC: since B is (2b, 0) and C is (2c, 2d), midpoint D is ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)\n\nSimilarly, midpoint E of AC: A(0,0) and C(2c, 2d), so midpoint E is ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)\n\nMidpoint F of AB: A(0,0) and B(2b, 0), so midpoint F is ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)\n\nSo, median BE connects B(2b, 0) to E(c, d). Similarly, median CF connects C(2c, 2d) to F(b, 0).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the midlines AD, BE, CF intersect at G, the centroid. So, we already have coordinates for G as ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3), which is the centroid.\n\nNow, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. We found coordinates for M(4b/3, 0) and N(4c/3, 4d/3).\n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangleENG. So, points E, N, G?\n\nWait, E is midpoint of AC, which is (c, d). N is (4c/3, 4d/3). G is ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3). So, triangleENG has vertices at E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and G((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3).\n\nTo find the area of triangleENG, we can use the shoelace formula. Let's compute the coordinates:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3)\n\nLet me write them as (x1, y1) = (c, d), (x2, y2) = (4c/3, 4d/3), (x3, y3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3)\n\nThe area is 1/2 |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nPlugging in:\n\n1/2 | c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) |\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = 2cd/3\n\nSecond term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = -4cd/9\n\nThird term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = -(2b + 2c)d/9\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\n2cd/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9\n\nConvert 2cd/3 to 6cd/9:\n\n6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2bd - 2cd)/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2cd - 2bd)/9 = (-2bd)/9\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is | -2bd/9 | = 2bd/9\n\nHence, the area is 1/2 * 2bd/9 = bd/9\n\nSo, area of triangleENG is bd/9. Now, we need to relate this to the area of triangleABC, which is 144.\n\nWhat is the area of triangleABC in terms of b, c, d?\n\nIn our coordinate system, A(0,0), B(2b, 0), C(2c, 2d). The area can be calculated using the determinant formula:\n\nArea = 1/2 | (2b)(2d) - (2c)(0) | = 1/2 |4bd| = 2bd\n\nGiven that the area is 144, so 2bd = 144 => bd = 72\n\nTherefore, the area of triangleENG is bd/9 = 72/9 = 8\n\nSo, the area of triangleENG is 8.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if everything is correct.\n\nFirst, coordinate system: placing A at (0,0), B at (2b,0), C at (2c,2d). Then centroid G at ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3). Then line MN through G parallel to BC. Found M at (4b/3, 0) and N at (4c/3, 4d/3). Then points E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), G((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3). Calculated area via shoelace and found it to be bd/9. Then since area ABC is 2bd = 144 => bd =72, so area of Engel is 72/9=8. Seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of ratios. Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G. The centroid divides the medians in 2:1. So, the distance from MN to BC is 1/3 of the height of ABC. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is ", "answer": "8"}

Pole podstawy stożka wynosi 30 jednostek kwadratowych, a jego wysokość to 6,5 jednostki. Ile jednostek sześciennych wynosi jego objętość?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the volume of a cone. The formula given is V equals one third times the base area times the height. So, V = (1/3) * B * h. Got that. The problem says the base area B is 30 square units, and the height h is 6.5 units. They want the volume in cubic units. Alright, so I just need to plug those numbers into the formula, right?\n\nFirst, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. It's not volume equals base area times height divided by three. Yeah, that's correct. So, if I substitute B with 30 and h with 6.5, then V should be (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 30 by 6.5. Let's see, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. So, 180 + 15 equals 195. So, 30 times 6.5 is 195. Then, multiply that by 1/3. So, 195 divided by 3. Let's divide 195 by 3. 3 goes into 19 six times (18), remainder 1. Bring down the 5. 3 goes into 15 five times. So, it's 65. So, 195 divided by 3 is 65. Therefore, the volume should be 65 cubic units. Hmm, seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 30 * 6.5: Let's verify. 6.5 can be written as 13/2. So, 30 * (13/2) = (30/2) * 13 = 15 * 13. 15 times 10 is 150, 15 times 3 is 45, so 150 + 45 = 195. Yep, same result. Then, 195 divided by 3: 3 * 60 = 180, 195 - 180 = 15, 15 / 3 = 5, so 60 + 5 = 65. Correct again. So, 65 cubic units is the volume.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me recheck the formula for the volume of a cone. I know that the volume of a cone is indeed (1/3)πr²h, which is the same as (1/3) * base area (since base area is πr²) * height. So, the formula they provided is correct. Therefore, plugging in the values they gave, which are B = 30 and h = 6.5, into V = (1/3) * B * h is the right approach. So, no issues there.\n\nIs there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again. The problem states that the base area is 30, and the height is 6.5. So, no, I didn't misread anything. The answer should be 65. Unless there's a trick here, but I don't see any. The problem is straightforward. It's just a matter of plugging in the numbers into the formula and doing the arithmetic. So, I think 65 is the correct answer. Let me just write that in the required format.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the cone is \\boxed{65} cubic units.\n</think>\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by the formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh \\), where \\( B \\) is the area of the base and \\( h \\) is the height. \n\nGiven:\n- The base area \\( B = 30 \\) square units\n- The height \\( h = 6.5 \\) units\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 \\times 6.5\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the product of the base area and the height:\n\\[\n30 \\times 6.5 = 195\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply the result by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 195 = 65\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is \\(\\boxed{65}\\) cubic units.", "answer": "65"}

Hmm, let me remember how arithmetic sequences work. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus a common difference, right? So the general formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need to find a_1 and d directly. Let me see. They gave me the 4th term and the 8th term. Let me write those down using the formula. \n\nFor the 4th term: a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\nFor the 8th term: a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\n\nSo I have two equations here. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a_1. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting a_4 from a_8: (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\nSimplify left side: a_1 - a_1 + 7d - 3d = 4d\nRight side: 300\nSo 4d = 300, which means d = 300 / 4 = 75. Okay, so the common difference is 75.\n\nNow that I know d, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find a_1. Let's use the 4th term equation.\n\na_1 + 3d = 200\na_1 + 3*75 = 200\na_1 + 225 = 200\nSubtract 225 from both sides: a_1 = 200 - 225 = -25. Hmm, so the first term is -25. That seems a bit unusual, but arithmetic sequences can have negative terms or differences.\n\nNow, to find the 60th term, a_60, I can use the general formula. Let's compute it.\n\na_60 = a_1 + (60 - 1)d = -25 + 59*75\n\nLet me calculate 59*75 first. Hmm, 59*75. Let's break it down. 60*75 is 4500, so subtract 1*75: 4500 - 75 = 4425. So 59*75 = 4425.\n\nThen, add that to -25: -25 + 4425 = 4400. So the 60th term is 4400. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, subtracting the equations: 8th term minus 4th term gives 4d = 300, so d = 75. Then, using the 4th term: a1 = 200 - 3*75 = 200 - 225 = -25. Then, a60 = -25 + 59*75. Calculated 59*75 as 4425, added to -25 gives 4400. That seems right.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can verify with the 8th term. If d = 75, then the 8th term should be a1 + 7d. Let's compute that: -25 + 7*75 = -25 + 525 = 500. Which matches the given value. So that's correct. Similarly, the 4th term: -25 + 3*75 = -25 + 225 = 200. That's also correct. So the calculations for a1 and d are correct.\n\nTherefore, the 60th term is indeed 4400. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 59*75: 50*75=3750, 9*75=675, so 3750+675=4425. Then 4425 -25=4400. Yep, correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 60th term is \\boxed{4400}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is 200 and the eighth term is 500, we need to find the 60th term.\n\nFirst, we use the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\nFor the fourth term:\n\\[\na_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\n\\]\n\nFor the eighth term:\n\\[\na_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the equation for \\(a_4\\) from \\(a_8\\):\n\\[\n(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\\]\n\\[\n4d = 300\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\frac{300}{4} = 75\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(d = 75\\) back into the equation for \\(a_4\\):\n\\[\na_1 + 3 \\cdot 75 = 200\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 + 225 = 200\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 = 200 - 225 = -25\n\\]\n\nTo find the 60th term, \\(a_{60}\\):\n\\[\na_{60} = a_1 + (60 - 1)d\n\\]\n\\[\na_{60} = -25 + 59 \\cdot 75\n\\]\n\\[\n59 \\cdot 75 = 4425\n\\]\n\\[\na_{60} = -25 + 4425 = 4400\n\\]\n\nThe 60th term is \\(\\boxed{4400}\\).", "answer": "350"}

Hmm, the denominator is 2² multiplied by 5⁷. I remember that when converting a fraction to a decimal, especially if the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and/or 5, the decimal will terminate. But first, maybe I need to simplify the denominator or adjust the fraction so that both exponents of 2 and 5 are the same, right?\n\nSo the denominator is 2² * 5⁷. To make this a power of 10, which is 2 * 5, we need the exponents of 2 and 5 to be equal. Since 5 has a higher exponent here, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2⁵ to balance the exponents. Let me check that: 5⁷ times 2⁵ is 10⁵, which is 100,000. And the numerator would be 21 times 2⁵. Let me calculate 2⁵ first. 2⁵ is 32. So 21 * 32. Let me do that multiplication: 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so 640 +32 = 672. So the fraction becomes 672 over 10⁵, which is 672/100,000. \n\nNow, converting that to a decimal. 672 divided by 100,000. To divide by 100,000, you move the decimal point five places to the left. So 672.0 becomes 0.00672. Let me verify that. Starting from the right, the first digit is 2 (tenths place), then 7 (hundredths), then 6 (thousandths), and then two more zeros for the ten-thousandths and hundred-thousandths places. So yes, 0.00672. \n\nWait, let me check if I did everything correctly. Original fraction: 21/(2² *5⁷). Multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵ to get 21*32/(2⁷*5⁷) = 672/(10⁷). Wait, hold on, 2⁷ is 128, and 5⁷ is 78125. Wait, but 2⁵*5⁷ is not 10⁵. Wait, no, 2²*5⁷. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵, then denominator becomes 2²*5⁷ *2⁵ = 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7*5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. Wait, no. Wait, no, 2^(2+5) is 2^7, and 5^7. So 2^7*5^7 is 10^7. Wait, but 2²*5⁷ is the original denominator. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵, then denominator becomes 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7*5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. So yes, the denominator becomes 10^7, which is 10,000,000. So the numerator is 21*2⁵. 2⁵ is 32. 21*32=672. So 672/10,000,000. Wait, hold on, 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.0000672. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 0.00672. That can't be right. What did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recast the problem. The original fraction is 21/(2² *5⁷). To convert this into a decimal, we can first note that 2² *5⁷ = 2² *5² *5⁵ = (2*5)^2 *5⁵ = 10² *5⁵. So that's 100 * 3125 = 312,500. Wait, 5⁵ is 3125. So denominator is 100 *3125 = 312,500. Therefore, 21 divided by 312,500. Hmm, let's compute that. 21 ÷ 312,500. Let's see, 312,500 goes into 21 zero times. So 0.000... Let me do this division step by step. \n\nFirst, 312,500 × 0.00001 is 0.003125. Wait, 312,500 × 0.00001 is 3.125. So 21 divided by 312,500 is 0.0000672. Wait, how? Let me check with decimals. Let's write 21 divided by 312,500. \n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵ to make the denominator a power of 10. Wait, let's see. The denominator is 2² *5⁷. To make it a power of 10, we need to have the same exponent for 2 and 5. Since 5 has a higher exponent, we need to multiply by 2⁵ to make the exponents equal. So:\n\n21 / (2² *5⁷) = (21 * 2⁵) / (2² *5⁷ *2⁵) = (21 *32) / (2⁷ *5⁷) = 672 / (10⁷) = 672 / 10,000,000 = 0.0000672.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial thought. So the correct decimal is 0.0000672. But earlier, I thought it was 0.00672. So where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. I made a mistake in the exponent when I first tried. Initially, I thought that multiplying numerator and denominator by 2⁵ would give 10⁵, but actually, the denominator becomes 2²*5⁷ *2⁵ = 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7 *5^7 = 10^7. Therefore, denominator is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. So 21*2⁵ is 21*32=672. Then 672 divided by 10,000,000 is indeed 0.0000672. \n\nSo the correct decimal is 0.0000672. Let me verify this by another method. Let's compute 21/(2² *5⁷). Let's compute 2²=4, 5⁷=78125. So denominator is 4*78125. 4*78125: 78125*4=312500. So 21/312500. Let's compute 21 divided by 312,500. \n\nAlternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 21: 1 / (312500/21). Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Let's instead perform the division 21 ÷ 312500. \n\n312500 goes into 21 zero times. Add a decimal point. 312500 goes into 210 zero times. 312500 goes into 2100 zero times. 312500 goes into 21000 zero times. 312500 goes into 210000 zero times. 312500 goes into 2100000 six times (since 312500*6=1,875,000). Subtract 1,875,000 from 2,100,000: 225,000. Bring down a zero: 2,250,000. 312500 goes into 2,250,000 seven times (312,500*7=2,187,500). Subtract: 2,250,000 -2,187,500=62,500. Bring down a zero: 625,000. 312500 goes into 625,000 twice (312,500*2=625,000). Subtract: 0. So the decimal is 0.0000672. \n\nYes, that matches. So the correct decimal is 0.0000672. So my initial mistake was thinking that multiplying by 2⁵ would lead to 10⁵, but actually, it leads to 10⁷. Therefore, the decimal is 0.0000672. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: We can note that the denominator is 2² *5⁷. To make it a power of 10, we need to multiply by 2⁵ to get 2⁷ *5⁷ =10⁷. Therefore, numerator becomes 21*2⁵=672. So 672/10⁷=0.0000672. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.0000672. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe using prime factors. The denominator is 2² *5⁷. To have a terminating decimal, the denominator must be a product of 2s and 5s. The decimal will terminate when the number of decimal places is the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator. Here, the exponents are 2 and 7. So we need 7 decimal places.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that a number that is a divisor of both 100 and 150 is a common divisor of these two numbers. The set of common divisors is called the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. So, maybe I should start by finding the GCD of 100 and 150. Then, once I have that, I can list all the divisors of that GCD and check which ones are two-digit numbers.\n\nAlright, let's compute the GCD of 100 and 150. To do that, I can use the prime factorization method. Let's factor each number into primes.\n\n100: 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 = 2² × 5²\n\n150: 2 × 3 × 5 × 5 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5²\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors. So, the common primes are 2 and 5. The lowest power of 2 is 2¹, and the lowest power of 5 is 5². Therefore, GCD(100, 150) = 2¹ × 5² = 2 × 25 = 50.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 100 and 150 is 50. That means all the divisors of 50 will also be divisors of both 100 and 150. Therefore, if I can find all the positive divisors of 50 and then count how many of them are two-digit numbers, I should get the answer.\n\nLet's list all the positive divisors of 50. To do this, I can list the pairs of numbers that multiply to 50.\n\nStarting with 1 and 50 (1 × 50 = 50)\n\nThen 2 and 25 (2 × 25 = 50)\n\nNext, 5 and 10 (5 × 10 = 50)\n\nThen, 10 and 5, but we've already listed that. Similarly, 25 and 2, which we also have, and 50 and 1. So, the divisors are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.\n\nNow, from this list, I need to identify which ones are two-digit numbers. Let's go through each divisor:\n\n1: single-digit\n\n2: single-digit\n\n5: single-digit\n\n10: two-digit\n\n25: two-digit\n\n50: two-digit\n\nSo, the two-digit divisors of 50 are 10, 25, and 50. That gives us three numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. All others are single-digit. So, yes, three two-digit numbers. Each of these should divide both 100 and 150. Let me verify with a couple of examples.\n\nTake 10: 100 ÷ 10 = 10, which is an integer. 150 ÷ 10 = 15, also an integer. So, 10 works.\n\n25: 100 ÷ 25 = 4, which is okay. 150 ÷ 25 = 6, which is also an integer. Good.\n\n50: 100 ÷ 50 = 2, 150 ÷ 50 = 3. Both are integers. So, 50 works.\n\nSo, all three of these are indeed common divisors. Are there any other two-digit numbers that divide both 100 and 150? Let's think. Suppose there is a two-digit number that is a divisor of 50 but I missed. Wait, 50's divisors are only 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. There isn't another divisor between 10 and 50 except those. So, no, those three are the only ones.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3. But wait, let me check once again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the GCD. Let me confirm GCD(100, 150) again.\n\nAnother way to compute GCD is using the Euclidean algorithm. Let's try that.\n\nGCD(150, 100) = GCD(100, 150 mod 100) = GCD(100, 50)\n\nGCD(100, 50) = GCD(50, 100 mod 50) = GCD(50, 0) = 50. So, yes, GCD is 50. That checks out.\n\nSo, divisors of 50 are correct. Therefore, three two-digit divisors. Hmm. Wait, but let me check if maybe there's a two-digit number that is a common divisor but not a divisor of GCD(100,150). But according to the properties of GCD, any common divisor of 100 and 150 must divide their GCD. So, that's correct. Therefore, all common divisors of 100 and 150 are exactly the divisors of GCD(100,150) = 50. Therefore, the list is complete.\n\nSo, the answer is 3. Therefore, there are three positive two-digit numbers that are divisors of both 100 and 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive two-digit divisors common to both 100 and 150 is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive two-digit numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. \n\nThe prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\) and the prime factorization of 150 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\\).

Hmm, let's start by recalling what a perfect nth power is. A number is a perfect nth power if it can be expressed as kⁿ where k is an integer. So, in this case, we want 2²⁴ = kⁿ for some integer k. \n\nFirst, I know that 2²⁴ is already a power of 2. Specifically, it's 2 raised to the 24th power. So if we're looking for n such that 2²⁴ is a perfect nth power, that means 24 must be a multiple of n, right? Because if 2²⁴ = (2^{24/n})ⁿ, then 24/n has to be an integer. Therefore, n must be a divisor of 24. \n\nLet me check that logic. If n divides 24, then 24/n is an integer, say m, so 2²⁴ = (2^m)ⁿ. That makes sense. So all divisors of 24 greater than 1 would work. But wait, the problem says \"dla ilu dodatnich liczb całkowitych n > 1\" which translates to \"for which positive integers n > 1\" is 2²⁴ a perfect nth power. So essentially, find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's take an example. Suppose n = 2. Then 2²⁴ is (2¹²)², which is a perfect square. If n = 3, then 2²⁴ = (2⁸)³, which is a perfect cube. Similarly, n = 4: 2²⁴ = (2⁶)⁴. So yes, as long as n divides 24, then 224 is a perfect nth power. \n\nWait, but let me test a divisor of 24. For example, n = 6. Then 2²⁴ = (2⁴)⁶, which is 16⁶. That works. Similarly, n = 8: 2²⁴ = (2³)⁸ = 8⁸. That's a perfect 8th power. What about n = 12? Then 2²⁴ = (2²)¹² = 4¹². Yep, that's a perfect 12th power. And n = 24: 2²⁴ = (2¹)²⁴ = 2²⁴. So 224 is also a perfect 24th power. \n\nBut the problem says n must be greater than 1. So all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. Let's list all divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is 2³ × 3¹. The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 8. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Excluding 1, the divisors greater than 1 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So these are the possible values of n. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be all divisors of 24 greater than 1, which are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Let me just confirm once again. If n divides 24, then 24 = n * k for some integer k, so 2²⁴ = (2ᵏ)ⁿ, which is indeed a perfect nth power. So yes, that seems correct. \n\nI don't think there's any other consideration here. The key is that the exponent 24 must be divisible by n, so n has to divide 24. Since 2 is prime, the divisors are as listed. So the conclusion is that all positive integers n > 1 that divide 24 are solutions. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) are all divisors of 24 greater than 1.

Ile ma pięciocentówek?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Hillary having eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. The total value is 75 cents. We need to find out how many nickels she has. Hmm, alright, so first, I should probably set up some equations here. Let me think.\n\nLet's denote the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. The problem states that the total number of coins is eleven. So, that gives me the first equation: D + N = 11. Got that. Then, the total value is 75 cents. Since dimes are worth 10 cents each and nickels are 5 cents each, the second equation should be 10D + 5N = 75. Right?\n\nSo now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n2. 10D + 5N = 75\n\nI need to solve this system to find the value of N. Let me think about the best way to approach this. Maybe substitution or elimination. Since the first equation can easily be solved for either variable, substitution might be straightforward.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express D in terms of N: D = 11 - N. Then substitute this into the second equation. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting D = 11 - N into the second equation:\n\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, distribute the 10:\n\n10*11 - 10N + 5N = 75\n\nThat's 110 - 10N + 5N = 75. Combine like terms:\n\n110 - 5N = 75\n\nNow, subtract 110 from both sides:\n\n-5N = 75 - 110\n\nWhich is -5N = -35\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nN = (-35)/(-5) = 7\n\nSo, N is 7. That means there are 7 nickels. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf N = 7, then D = 11 - 7 = 4. So, 4 dimes and 7 nickels. Let's verify the total value:\n\n4 dimes * 10 cents = 40 cents\n7 nickels * 5 cents = 35 cents\nTotal: 40 + 35 = 75 cents. Perfect, that matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations just to be sure. Did I set them up correctly?\n\nTotal coins: 4 + 7 = 11. Correct.\n\nTotal value: 4*10 + 7*5 = 40 + 35 = 75. Yep, that's right.\n\nHmm, seems solid. So, the answer should be 7 nickels. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra:\n\nStarting with substitution:\n\nD = 11 - N\n\n10D + 5N = 75\n\n10*(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n\n110 -10N +5N = 75\n\n110 -5N =75\n\n-5N=75-110\n\n-5N= -35\n\nN=7. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try elimination. Let's see.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. D + N = 11\n\n2. 10D +5N =75\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 5, I get:\n\n5D +5N =55\n\nThen subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(10D +5N) - (5D +5N) =75 -55\n\n5D =20\n\nD=4\n\nThen, substituting back into the first equation, D + N =11, so 4 + N=11, so N=7. Same answer. Okay, so that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the number of nickels is 7. I think that's solid. No mistakes here. The answer checks out with both substitution and elimination methods. So, yeah, 7 nickels.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of nickels (N) among eleven coins (all dimes and nickels) totaling 75 cents, we set up the following system of equations:\n\n1. **Total coins**: \\( D + N = 11 \\)  \n2. **Total value**: \\( 10D + 5N = 75 \\)\n\n**Step 1**: Solve for \\( D \\) from the first equation:  \n\\( D = 11 - N \\)\n\n**Step 2**: Substitute \\( D = 11 - N \\) into the second equation:  \n\\[\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75  \n\\]  \nExpand and simplify:  \n\\[\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75  \n110 - 5N = 75  \n-5N = -35  \nN = 7\n\\]\n\n**Verification**:  \n- If \\( N = 7 \\), then \\( D = 11 - 7 = 4 \\).  \n- Total value: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 7 \\times 5 = 40 + 35 = 75 \\) cents.  \n\nThus, the number of nickels is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).", "answer": "7"}

Jakie jest prawdopodobieństwo, że suma wybranych przez nich liczb będzie parzysta?", "question": "Paul i Jesse wybierają losowo liczbę z pierwszych sześciu liczb pierwszych. Jakie jest prawdopodobieństwo, że suma wybranych przez nich liczb będzie parzysta?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Paul and Jesse picking numbers randomly from the first six prime numbers, and we need to find the probability that their sum is even. Hmm, primes... right, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first six primes would be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Let me confirm that: 2 is the first prime, then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Yeah, that's correct. So those are the numbers they can pick from.\n\nNow, Paul and Jesse each pick one number, right? So each of them picks a number from these six primes, and we want the sum to be even. The question is asking for the probability of that happening. So probability is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So first, let's figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Since each person picks independently, and there are 6 choices for each, the total number of possible pairs is 6 * 6 = 36. So 36 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how many of those outcomes result in an even sum. So when is the sum of two numbers even? Let's recall, even plus even is even, odd plus odd is even, and even plus odd is odd. So the sum is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. So we need to count how many pairs are both even or both odd.\n\nBut wait, in the first six primes, how many even primes are there? Let's check. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Only 2 is even; all others are odd. So there's only one even number, which is 2, and the rest five are odd. So Paul and Jesse can each pick 2 or one of the five odds.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of pairs where both pick even (which is only 2) or both pick odd. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, both pick even. There's only 1 even number, so the number of ways they can both pick even is 1 (Paul picks 2) * 1 (Jesse picks 2) = 1. So that's 1 favorable outcome.\n\nThen, both pick odd. There are 5 odd primes. So the number of ways they can both pick odd is 5 (Paul's choices) * 5 (Jesse's choices) = 25. So that's 25 favorable outcomes.\n\nAdding those together, total favorable outcomes are 1 + 25 = 26. Therefore, the probability is 26/36, which simplifies to 13/18.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Total possible pairs: 6*6=36. Correct. Both even: only (2,2), which is 1. Both odd: 5*5=25. So 1+25=26. So 26/36 reduces by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 13/18. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's think again. The sum is even if both are even or both are odd. Since there's only one even prime, the probability that Paul picks even is 1/6, and Jesse picks even is 1/6. So the probability both pick even is (1/6)*(1/6)=1/36. Then, the probability that both pick odd: Paul has 5/6 chance to pick an odd, Jesse also 5/6. So 5/6 *5/6=25/36. Then total probability is 1/36 +25/36=26/36=13/18. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the sum is even if the two numbers are both even or both odd. Since there's only one even number, the chance they both pick even is (1/6)(1/6). The chance that Paul picks odd is 5/6, and then Jesse picks odd is 5/6, so 25/36. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, could we use combinations? Wait, but since Paul and Jesse are picking independently, order matters here. So it's permutations, not combinations. So total outcomes are 36, as we considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe list all possibilities? But that would take time. But maybe for smaller numbers. Let's see. The primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13.\n\nPossible pairs where sum is even:\n\nCase 1: Both even. Only (2,2).\n\nCase 2: Both odd. All pairs where both numbers are odd. The odd numbers are 3,5,7,11,13. So 5 numbers, so 5*5=25 pairs.\n\nTotal favorable: 1 +25=26. Total possible:36. So 26/36=13/18. Yep, same answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the probability is 13/18.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}}.\n</think>\n\nPaul and Jesse each pick a number from the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The problem says that the point (a, b) lies on the line given by the equation 3x + 2y = 12. When a is 4, what is the value of b? Alright, so I need to find the value of b when x is 4 on this line. \n\nFirst, I remember that if a point is on a line, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the line. That means if I substitute x with 4, then solving for y (which is b in this case) should give me the correct value. Let me write that down.\n\nThe equation is 3x + 2y = 12. Substituting x = 4 into this equation gives 3*4 + 2y = 12. Let me compute 3*4 first. That's 12. So now the equation becomes 12 + 2y = 12. \n\nNow, to solve for y, I need to isolate y. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. So 12 + 2y - 12 = 12 - 12. That simplifies to 2y = 0. Then divide both sides by 2 to get y = 0. \n\nWait, so if a is 4, then b is 0? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting over: 3x + 2y = 12. If x is 4, then 3*4 is 12. So 12 + 2y = 12. Subtract 12: 2y = 0. Divide by 2: y = 0. Yep, that seems right. \n\nBut maybe I should plug the values back into the original equation to verify. Let's substitute x = 4 and y = 0 into 3x + 2y. That would be 3*4 + 2*0 = 12 + 0 = 12, which matches the right side of the equation. So that checks out. \n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe solving for y in terms of x first. Let's see. Starting with 3x + 2y = 12, subtract 3x from both sides: 2y = -3x + 12. Then divide both sides by 2: y = (-3/2)x + 6. So the equation in slope-intercept form is y = -3/2 x + 6. Then, if x is 4, plug that into the equation: y = -3/2 *4 +6. Calculate -3/2 *4: that's -6. So y = -6 +6 = 0. Same result. \n\nOkay, so both methods give me y = 0 when x =4. That seems consistent. Maybe I can visualize the line to get a better intuition. The equation 3x + 2y =12 can be thought of as a line where when x is 0, y is 6 (since 3*0 +2y=12 => y=6). When y is 0, x is 4 (since 3x +2*0=12 => x=4). So this line crosses the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,6). Therefore, the point (4,0) is indeed on the line, which is exactly what we found.

The problem is about a shape made up of twelve 1x1 squares forming a rectangle. The shaded area's total area is to be found. Hmm, the Asymptote code is provided, which draws the figure. Let me try to visualize it based on the description and the code.\n\nFirst, the Asymptote code mentions a size of 4cm, but the units are in the code's own coordinate system, so maybe that's not directly relevant. The code fills two regions: one from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), and another from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). Then it draws a grid from x=0 to x=3 and y=0 to y=4. There are some diagonal lines connecting (0,4) to (3,0) and (0,4) to (2,0). \n\nSo, breaking this down, the main rectangle formed by the grid is 3 units wide (from x=0 to x=3) and 4 units tall (from y=0 to y=4). Therefore, the total area of the rectangle is 3*4=12, which matches twelve 1x1 squares. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the shaded areas are two triangles. The first triangle is from (0,4) down to (0,0) and then to (2,0). Wait, connecting those points. So that's a right triangle with vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The base of this triangle would be 2 units (from (0,0) to (2,0)), and the height is 4 units (from (0,0) up to (0,4)). But actually, since it's a triangle, the area would be (base * height)/2. However, the base here is 2, and the height is 4, so the area would be (2*4)/2 = 4. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the orientation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 4. But in that case, the area is indeed 4. However, let me check the coordinates again. The points are (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). So yes, plotting these points, the triangle is a right triangle with vertical leg from (0,0) to (0,4) which is 4 units, and the horizontal leg from (0,0) to (2,0) which is 2 units. So the area is (4*2)/2 = 4. Got it.\n\nThen the second shaded triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). Let's see. The points (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). Connecting these would form another right triangle. The horizontal leg from (3,0) to (3,4) is 4 units, and the vertical leg from (3,0) to (0,0) is 3 units, but since we're connecting (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0), that's a right triangle with legs of 3 and 4. So area would be (3*4)/2 = 6. Wait, but (0,4) to (3,4) is 3 units leftwards, and (3,4) to (3,0) is 4 units downwards. So the triangle has legs of 3 and 4, so area is 6.\n\nTherefore, the total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. But wait, let me double-check. The first triangle is (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). Area 4. The second is (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). Area 6. Adding them gives 10. The entire rectangle is 12, so the unshaded area would be 2. Is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the triangles. Let me visualize the grid. The rectangle is 3 columns (x=0 to x=3) and 4 rows (y=0 to y=4). The first shaded triangle is in the left edge, going down to (2,0). The second is a larger triangle on the right edge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded areas are overlapping? But looking at the coordinates, the first triangle is from the top-left corner down to the bottom-left and then right 2 units. The second triangle is from the top-left corner down to the bottom-right and then up 4 units. Wait, no. (0,4) to (3,4) is the top edge, then to (3,0) is the right edge. So that triangle is the upper right part of the rectangle, spanning the entire height and 3 units width. But since it goes to (3,4) and (3,0), that's a right triangle with base 3 and height 4, area 6. The other triangle is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), which is a right triangle with base 2 and height 4, area 4. So total shaded area is 10. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \" whole 12 squares tworzy prostokąt\", so twelve 1x1 squares make a rectangle. The Asymptote code draws a 3x4 grid, which is 12 squares. So the entire figure is 3x4. The shaded areas are two triangles. If their areas are 4 and 6, total 10, then the remaining area is 2. That seems possible.\n\nBut maybe I need to confirm if these triangles are non-overlapping. The first triangle is in the left half, the second is in the right half. They don't overlap. So 4 + 6 = 10 is correct. Therefore, the shaded area's total integral area is 10.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe the triangles are not right triangles? Let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nFirst triangle: (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). Connecting these points, the sides are from (0,4) down to (0,0), then right to (2,0), then back up to (0,4). So that's a right triangle with legs 4 and 2. Area is (2*4)/2 = 4.\n\nSecond triangle: (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). Connecting these, from (0,4) to (3,4) is a horizontal line to the right, then down to (3,0), then back to (0,4). That's a right triangle with legs 3 (horizontal) and 4 (vertical). Area is (3*4)/2 = 6.\n\nYes, so total shaded area is 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, the answer should be 10. But let me check if there's any other shaded regions or if I misread the Asymptote code.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code also draws some diagonal lines: draw((0,4)--(3,0)); draw((0,4)--(2,0)); So these diagonals might be part of the figure. Let me see. The first diagonal is from (0,4) to (3,0), which is the hypotenuse of the larger triangle. The second diagonal is from (0,4) to (2,0), which is the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle. So these diagonals are part of the shaded triangles. Therefore, the shaded areas are indeed the two triangles as I considered.\n\nTherefore, the total shaded area is 10. Since the problem is in Polish, \"dwanaanie\" probably means twelve, and \"prostokąt\" is rectangle. So the answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total integral area of the shaded region is \\boxed{10}.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves finding the total integral area of the shaded region formed by twelve 1x1 squares arranged in a 3x4 rectangle. The shaded areas are two right triangles.\n\n1. **First Triangle**: This triangle has vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). It is a right triangle with a base of 2 units (from (0,0) to (2,0)) and a height of 4 units (from (0,0) to (0,4)). The area is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Triangle**: This triangle has vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (3,0). It is a right triangle with a base of 3 units (from (3,0) to (3,4)) and a height of 4 units (from (0,4) to (3,4)). The area is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\nAdding the areas of both triangles gives the total integral area of the shaded region:\n\\[\n4 + 6 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the total integral area of the shaded region is \\boxed{10}.", "answer": "10"}

So the problem is about a spinning wheel with numbers on a circle. The first number is determined by spinning the wheel divided into 4 parts, each labeled 1, 2, 3. So when you spin the first wheel, you get a number from 1 to 3, each equally likely. Then the second number is from another wheel divided into 4 parts labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. Spinning that wheel gives a number from 1 to 4, also equally likely. Then, based on these two numbers, you determine a column and a row on a chessboard, and the pion is placed on that intersection. The question is, what's the probability that the pion ends up on a shaded square?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which squares are shaded on the chessboard. The Asymptote code is provided, so maybe I can visualize it. The chessboard is drawn as a 6x6 grid? Wait, the coordinates in the Asymptote code go from (3,-2) to (6,2), which might be a 3x4 grid? Wait, the code is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe Asymptote code draws a circle, then some lines to divide it. Then there are labels 1, 2, 3, 4. But the actual grid is drawn with lines from (3,-2) to (6,2), so maybe it's a 3x4 grid? Wait, the coordinates are (3,-2) to (6,2), so that's 3 columns (from 3 to 6) and 4 rows (from -2 to 2). But rows are usually horizontal, so maybe rows are horizontal lines at y = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, but the code draws vertical lines from (3,-2) to (6,-2), etc. Wait, maybe the chessboard is 3x4? But a chessboard is 8x8. Hmm, maybe the figure is a scaled-down version or a section of a chessboard. Wait, the labels on the Asymptote code: the first wheel (the one for the column) has labels 1, 2, 3 at the top, and the second wheel (for the row) has labels 1, 2, 3, 4. So perhaps the chessboard is divided into 3 columns and 4 rows? But a standard chessboard is 8x8. Wait, maybe it's a 3x4 grid? But the shaded squares might be a specific pattern.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code again: the fill commands create shaded squares. The first fill is from (3,0) to (4,1), then (4,1) to (5,2), etc. Wait, but the coordinates might be scaled. Alternatively, since the Asymptote code is a bit complex, maybe it's better to focus on the labels and the possible positions. The first wheel (column) has labels 1, 2, 3, and the second wheel (row) has labels 1, 2, 3, 4. So the columns are 1, 2, 3 and rows are 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the chessboard in question is a 3x4 grid? So there are 3 columns (left to right: 1, 2, 3) and 4 rows (top to bottom: 1, 2, 3, 4). Each intersection is a square. Then, which squares are shaded?\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code's fill commands:\n\n1. fill((3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n2. fill((3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n3. fill((4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n4. fill((4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n5. fill((5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n6. fill((5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle, gray(0.7));\n\nSo each fill command is creating a 1x1 square. Let's parse each one:\n\n1. First fill: (3,0) to (4,1). So starting at (3,0), moving right to (4,0), up to (4,1), left to (3,1), down to (3,0). Wait, actually, the coordinates might be in a grid where (3,0) is the bottom-left corner of the first shaded square. So this is a square from x=3 to 4, y=0 to 1. Similarly, the second fill is from (3,-2) to (4,-1), so another square in the bottom-left area. The third fill is (4,1) to (5,2), so moving up. The fourth fill is (4,-1) to (5,0). The fifth is (5,0) to (6,1), and the sixth is (5,-2) to (6,-1). So these are six shaded squares arranged in a pattern. Specifically, they seem to be every other square in a checkerboard pattern, but limited to certain positions. Let's map them:\n\n1. (3,0) to (4,1): This is the square at column 3, row 0. Wait, but rows and columns can be confusing. If columns are 1, 2, 3 and rows are 1, 2, 3, 4, then maybe (3,0) corresponds to column 3, row 1? Because in coordinate systems, sometimes y increases downward. Wait, in Asymptote, the coordinate system has (0,0) at the bottom-left, with x increasing to the right and y increasing upward. But the labels on the Asymptote code have \"1\" at (3.5,-2), which is the bottom row. So maybe the rows are labeled from bottom to top as 1, 2, 3, 4. So row 1 is the bottom row, row 4 is the top row. Similarly, columns are labeled from left to right as 1, 2, 3. So the first shaded square is at column 3, row 1 (since y=0 is the bottom, but row labels are 1, 2, 3, 4). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's think of the grid as having columns 1 (leftmost) to 3 (rightmost) and rows 1 (bottom) to 4 (top). Each square is identified by its column and row. Then, the shaded squares are:\n\n1. (column 3, row 1)\n2. (column 1, row 1)\n3. (column 3, row 2)\n4. (column 1, row 2)\n5. (column 3, row 3)\n6. (column 1, row 3)\n7. (column 3, row 4)\n8. (column 1, row 4)\n\nWait, but according to the Asymptote code:\n\n1. First fill: (3,0) to (4,1). If column 3 corresponds to x=3 to 4, and row 1 corresponds to y=0 to 1 (since row 1 is the bottom), then this is column 3, row 1. Then the second fill is (3,-2) to (4,-1), which is column 3, row 1 again? Wait, maybe not. Let me list all the fills:\n\n1. (3,0)–(3,1)–(4,1)–(4,0)–cycle: This is a square from x=3 to 4, y=0 to 1. So column 3, row 1 (since rows increase upward, but labels are placed at the bottom). So row 1 is at the bottom, so y=0 to 1 is row 1.\n\n2. (3,-2)–(3,-1)–(4,-1)–(4,-2)–cycle: Column 3, row 1 (since y=-2 to -1 is row 1). Then, moving up:\n\n3. (4,1)–(4,2)–(5,2)–(5,1)–cycle: Column 4 to 5, but columns are only up to 3. Wait, column 4 is beyond the grid? Wait, the grid is from x=3 to x=6, but the columns are labeled 1, 2, 3. So column 1 is x=3 to 4, column 2 is x=4 to 5, column 3 is x=5 to 6. Wait, no. The labels on the Asymptote code's grid are:\n\nlabel(\"1\",(3.5,-2),S); So column 1 is at x=3.5, which is between x=3 and 4? Wait, maybe each column is a vertical strip. Wait, the first fill is from (3,0) to (4,1). If column 1 is x=3 to 4, column 2 is x=4 to 5, column 3 is x=5 to 6. Similarly, rows are horizontal. The first fill is in column 1 (x=3-4), row 1 (y=0-1). Then the second fill is column 1 (x=3-4), row 1? Wait, no. The second fill is (3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle. So x=3 to 4, y=-2 to -1. Since rows increase upward, row 1 is y=-2 to -1? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the rows are labeled from the bottom. If the bottom row is row 1 (y=-2 to -1), then row 2 is y=-1 to 0, row 3 is y=0 to 1, row 4 is y=1 to 2. Then, the first fill is column 3 (x=3-4), row 1 (y=0-1). Wait, but according to the coordinates, (3,0) is the bottom-left of that square. So if rows increase upward, row 1 is the bottom row, row 2 is the next, etc. So the first fill is column 3, row 1 (y=0-1). The second fill is column 3, row 1? Wait, no. The second fill is (3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle. So that's x=3-4, y=-2-1. Wait, but rows are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. So row 1 is y=-2 to -1, row 2 is y=-1 to 0, row 3 is y=0 to 1, row 4 is y=1 to 2. Therefore, the second fill is column 3 (x=3-4), row 1 (y=-2-1). Similarly, the third fill is (4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle. So x=4-5, y=1-2. That would be column 2 (x=4-5), row 3 (y=1-2). Wait, but y=1-2 is row 3? Because row 1 is y=-2-1, row 2 is y=-1-0, row 3 is y=0-1, row 4 is y=1-2. So yes, y=1-2 is row 4? Wait, no. If row 1 is y=-2-1, then row 4 is y=1-2. So the third fill is column 2 (x=4-5), row 4 (y=1-2). Then the fourth fill is (4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle. So x=4-5, y=-1-0. That's column 2 (x=4-5), row 2 (y=-1-0). Fifth fill is (5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle: x=5-6, y=0-1. Column 3 (x=5-6), row 3 (y=0-1). Sixth fill is (5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle: x=5-6, y=-2-1. Column 3 (x=5-6), row 1 (y=-2-1). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to map the coordinates to rows and columns, just list all the shaded squares based on their positions.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern here. The shaded squares seem to be in columns 1 and 3, alternating rows. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the coordinates:\n\n1. (3,0) to (4,1): Column 3 (since x=3-4), row 1 (y=0-1)\n2.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the denominator is 5^7 times 2^8. I remember that when dealing with fractions like this, it's helpful to simplify them into a decimal form. However, since the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5, this should result in a terminating decimal. The number of decimal places should be determined by the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Here, the exponent of 2 is 8 and the exponent of 5 is 7, so the decimal will terminate after 8 decimal places. That makes sense because multiplying by 2^8 and 5^7 would give a denominator of 10^7, but since 2^8 is 256 and 5^7 is 78125, their product is larger than 10^7. Wait, no, actually, the denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. Let's compute that:\n\n5^7 is 78125, and 2^8 is 256. Multiplying these together: 78125 * 256. Let me compute that. 78125 * 256 = 78125 * 200 + 78125 * 56. 78125*200 is 15,625,000. 78125*56: 78125*50=3,906,250 and 78125*6=468,750. Adding those gives 3,906,250 + 468,750 = 4,375,000. So total denominator is 15,625,000 + 4,375,000 = 20,000,000. Wait, 15,625,000 + 4,375,000 is 20,000,000. So the denominator is 20,000,000. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 / 20,000,000.\n\nBut wait, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let me check that. Because 5^7 is 78125, 2^8 is 256. 78125 * 256 is indeed 20,000,000. So the denominator is 20 million. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 over 20 million. So converting that to decimal: 4321 divided by 20,000,000.\n\nHmm, how do I compute that? Let's see. 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Since 20,000,000 is 2*10^7. So 4321/(2*10^7) = (4321/2)/10^7 = 2160.5 / 10^7. Which is 0.00021605. Wait, let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by something to make the denominator a power of 10. Since the denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. Let's see, to convert this into a denominator of 10^n, we need to have equal exponents of 2 and 5. Here, we have 5^7 and 2^8. So, to make them equal, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(8-7) = 5^1 to balance the exponents. So:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n4321 * 5 = 21,605\n\nDenominator becomes 5^7 * 2^8 * 5 = 5^8 * 2^8 = (5*2)^8 = 10^8\n\nSo the fraction becomes 21,605 / 10^8. Therefore, the decimal expansion is 0.00021605. Let me check that. 21,605 divided by 10^8 is moving the decimal point 8 places to the left. So 21,605 becomes 0.00021605. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the decimal expansion is 0.00021605. Now, the question is asking for the sum of the digits in this decimal expansion. Let's write out the decimal:\n\n0.00021605\n\nBreaking it down digit by digit after the decimal point:\n\nFirst digit: 0\n\nSecond digit: 0\n\nThird digit: 0\n\nFourth digit: 2\n\nFifth digit: 1\n\nSixth digit: 6\n\nSeventh digit: 0\n\nEighth digit: 5\n\nSo the digits after the decimal are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Let's add them up:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 2 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 14.\n\nWait, that's 14. So the sum of the digits is 14. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the decimal conversion.\n\nOriginal fraction: 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8). Let's confirm the decimal expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 4321 divided by 20,000,000 directly.\n\n4321 ÷ 20,000,000. Let's compute that.\n\nSince 1 ÷ 20,000,000 = 0.00000005\n\nSo 4321 * 0.00000005 = ?\n\n4321 * 0.00000005 = 4321 * 5 * 10^(-8) = 21,605 * 10^(-8) = 0.00021605. Yes, same result.\n\nSo the decimal is indeed 0.00021605. Therefore, the digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Sum is 2+1+6+5=14.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other digits in the decimal expansion. Since the denominator is 10^8, the decimal should terminate after 8 digits. So the decimal is exactly 0.00021605, with no more digits. Therefore, the digits are as above.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 14. Hmm. But let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, 21,605 divided by 10^8 is 0.00021605. So yes, the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So sum is 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14. Therefore, the answer should be 14.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The fraction is 4321/(5^7 * 2^8). Let me compute 5^7 and 2^8 again to confirm the denominator.\n\n5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125, 5^6=15625, 5^7=78125.\n\n2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256.\n\nSo 5^7 * 2^8 = 78125 * 256. Let's compute that again. 78125 * 256:\n\nBreaking down 256 as 250 + 6.\n\n78125 * 250 = 78125 * 200 + 78125 * 50 = 15,625,000 + 3,906,250 = 19,531,250\n\n78125 * 6 = 468,750\n\nAdding those together: 19,531,250 + 468,750 = 20,000,000. Correct. So denominator is 20,000,000. Then 4321 divided by 20,000,000 is indeed 0.00021605. Therefore, digits sum to 14. So the answer is 14.\n\nWait, but just to be 100% sure, maybe I can write out the decimal expansion step by step.\n\nStarting with 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let's perform the division manually.\n\n4321 ÷ 20,000,000. Since 20,000,000 is larger than 4321, the result will be less than 1, so we start with 0.\n\nWe can write 4321.000000000 divided by 20,000,000.\n\n20,000,000 goes into 43210 (the first 5 digits) 0 times. So we write 0. Then, 20,000,000 goes into 43210 0 times. Then into 432100 (adding a decimal point and a zero) 0 times. Then into 4321000 (three zeros) 0 times. Then into 43210000 (four zeros) 0 times. Then into 432100000 (five zeros) 0 times. Then into 4321000000 (six zeros) 0 times. Then into 43210000000 (seven zeros) 0 times. Wait, this seems tedious. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20,000,000 = 2*10^7. So 4321/(2*10^7) = (4321/2)/10^7 = 2160.5/10^7 = 0.00021605. So that's straightforward. So the decimal is 0.00021605, which is 0.00021605. So writing that out: 0.00021605. So the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Sum is 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14. So yes, the sum is 14.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more for any possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that when I converted the fraction to 21,605/10^8, I might have made a mistake in the multiplication? Let's check 4321*5. 4321*5: 4000*5=20,000, 300*5=1,500, 20*5=100, 1*5=5. Adding those: 20,000 + 1,500 = 21,500; 21,500 + 100 = 21,600; 21,600 + 5 = 21,605. Correct. So numerator is indeed 21,605. Therefore, 21,605/10^8 is 0.00021605. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. The sum of the digits is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{14}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction \\(\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8}\\), we start by simplifying the denominator. \n\nFirst, we note that \\(5^7 \\cdot 2^8\\) can be converted to a power of 10 by balancing the exponents of 2 and 5. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5 (to make the exponents of 2 and 5 equal):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{4321 \\cdot 5}{5^8 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{21605}{10^8}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies the fraction to \\(\\frac{21605}{10^8}\\), which is the decimal \\(0.00021605\\). \n\nNext, we identify the digits in the decimal expansion \\(0.00021605\\). The digits after the decimal point are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Summing these digits:\n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the digits in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8}\\) is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).", "answer": "14"}

Hmm, that's eight terms multiplied together. Let me start by writing them all out to see if I can spot any patterns or symmetries.\n\nFirst, let's list all the angles:\n\n20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°.\n\nI notice that 60° and 120° are special angles with known sine values. Similarly, 100°, 140°, and 160° could be related to their supplements or something. Wait, 100° is 180° - 80°, 140° is 180° - 40°, and 160° is 180° - 20°. So sin100° = sin80°, sin140° = sin40°, and sin160° = sin20°. Because sine of an angle and its supplement are equal. Let me verify that. Yes, sin(180° - θ) = sinθ. So that's correct.\n\nSo substituting those in, the product becomes:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin40° * sin20° * sin60°.\n\nWait, because:\n\nsin100° = sin80°,\n\nsin140° = sin40°,\n\nsin160° = sin20°.\n\nSo the product is:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin40° * sin20° * sin60°.\n\nSo grouping similar terms:\n\n[ sin20° ]² * [ sin40° ]² * [ sin60° ]² * sin80°.\n\nBut wait, there's an extra sin80° term. Wait, let's check again.\n\nOriginal angles: 20°,40°,60°,80°,100°,120°,140°,160°.\n\nAfter substitution: 20°,40°,60°,80°,80°,40°,20°,60°.\n\nSo yes, sin20° appears twice, sin40° appears twice, sin60° appears twice, and sin80° appears once. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, the original list is 20°,40°,60°,80°,100°,120°,140°,160°.\n\nAfter substitution:\n\n20°,40°,60°,80°,80°, sin120°, sin140°, sin160° which is sin80°, sin40°, sin20°.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me list all substituted angles step by step.\n\nOriginal angles:\n\n1. 20°\n\n2. 40°\n\n3. 60°\n\n4. 80°\n\n5. 100° → sin80°\n\n6. 120° → sin60°\n\n7. 140° → sin40°\n\n8. 160° → sin20°\n\nTherefore, the product is:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin60° * sin40° * sin20°.\n\nSo grouping:\n\n[ sin20° * sin20° ] * [ sin40° * sin40° ] * [ sin60° * sin60° ] * sin80°.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(sin20°)^2 * (sin40°)^2 * (sin60°)^2 * sin80°.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original product has eight terms. Let's count:\n\n1. sin20°\n\n2. sin40°\n\n3. sin60°\n\n4. sin80°\n\n5. sin80°\n\n6. sin60°\n\n7. sin40°\n\n8. sin20°\n\nSo yes, sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, each twice, and sin80° once. Wait, no, sin80° is only once? Wait, no:\n\nWait, original angles: 20°,40°,60°,80°,100°,120°,140°,160°.\n\nAfter substitution:\n\nsin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin80°, sin60°, sin40°, sin20°.\n\nSo sin20° appears twice, sin40° twice, sin60° twice, and sin80° once. Wait, but sin80° is present only once? But the original angle 80° is still there. So yes, sin80° is only once. So the product is:\n\n(sin20°)^2 * (sin40°)^2 * (sin60°)^2 * sin80°.\n\nHmm, okay. So maybe I can compute each of these terms separately.\n\nFirst, let's recall that sin60° = √3/2, so (sin60°)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSin20° and sin40° are less common angles. Sin80° is also not a standard angle, but maybe we can express them in terms of other angles or use some identities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a product formula for multiple sine terms. I recall that products of sines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum identities, but with eight terms, that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity?\n\nWait, the angles here are 20°,40°,60°,80°, which are all multiples of 20°, and their supplements. Let me note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, etc., are all multiples of 20°, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, since 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are angles that are multiples of 20°, each increasing by 20°, up to 80°, and then their supplements. Wait, 100° is 80°, 140° is 40°, 160° is 20°, but those are already included. So perhaps we can pair terms or use multiple-angle identities.\n\nAlternatively, since sinθ * sin(60° - θ) * sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. Wait, that might be a useful identity. Let me recall that identity.\n\nYes, there's an identity that says sinθ * sin(60° - θ) * sin(60° + θ) = (1/4) sin3θ. Let me check that. Let's take θ = 20°, then sin20° * sin40° * sin80° = (1/4) sin60°. Let's verify:\n\nLeft side: sin20° * sin40° * sin80°.\n\nRight side: (1/4) sin60° ≈ (1/4)(√3/2) ≈ √3/8 ≈ 0.2165.\n\nLeft side: sin20° ≈ 0.3420, sin40° ≈ 0.6428, sin80° ≈ 0.9848. Multiplying these: 0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2197, then * 0.9848 ≈ 0.2165. Yes, that matches. So the identity holds. Therefore, sinθ * sin(60° - θ) * sin(60° + θ) = (1/4) sin3θ. So that's a useful identity.\n\nSimilarly, if we take θ = 0°, but that might not help. Wait, but in our case, we have sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, and then sin80°, sin40°, sin20°, sin60° again. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's consider the product step by step.\n\nOriginal product: sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin100° * sin120° * sin140° * sin160°.\n\nBut as we saw, sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°. Therefore, the product becomes:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin60° * sin40° * sin20°.\n\nWhich groups to:\n\n(sin20°)^2 * (sin40°)^2 * (sin60°)^2 * sin80°.\n\nSo (sin20° * sin40° * sin60°)^2 * sin80°.\n\nBut from the identity above, sinθ * sin(60° - θ) * sin(60° + θ) = (1/4) sin3θ. Let's see if we can apply that here.\n\nNote that 20°, 40°, 80°: but 60° - 20° = 40°, 60° + 20° = 80°. So sin20° * sin40° * sin80° = (1/4) sin60°. So that's one application of the identity. So sin20° * sin40° * sin80° = (1/4) sin60°.\n\nBut in our product, we have (sin20° * sin40° * sin60°)^2 * sin80°. Wait, so sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, but in the identity, it's sinθ * sin(60° - θ) * sin(60° + θ) = (1/4) sin3θ. So if θ = 20°, then sin20° * sin40° * sin80° = (1/4) sin60°, as above.\n\nBut in our case, we have sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, which is different. So maybe we can use another identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sin60° as √3/2 and then proceed. Let's try.\n\nFirst, let's compute (sin20° * sin40° * sin60°)^2 * sin80°.\n\nCompute sin20° * sin40° * sin60°:\n\n= sin20° * sin40° * (√3/2).\n\nFrom the identity, sin20° * sin40° * sin80° = (1/4) sin60°, but here we have sin20° * sin40° * sin60°, which is different. Hmm. Maybe we need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, note that sin60° = sin(60°), and maybe use product-to-sum formulas step by step.\n\nAlternatively, think about the product of multiple sine terms. There is a formula for the product of sines in arithmetic progression, but I don't remember exactly. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing all sines in terms of complex exponentials. Since sinθ = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i). Then the product would be a product of such terms. But that might get complicated with eight terms, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160° are all angles in the first and second quadrants, symmetric around 90°. Wait, 20° and 160°, 40° and 140°, 60° and 120°, 80° and 100°, but 90° is in the middle. Wait, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. If you pair them as 20° and 160°, 40° and 140°, etc., but their sines are equal because sin(180° - θ) = sinθ. So sin160° = sin20°, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, sin100° = sin80°. So actually, the original product is (sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°)^2. Wait, no:\n\nWait, original product is sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin100° * sin120° * sin140° * sin160°.\n\nBut sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°. Therefore, the product becomes:\n\nsin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin60° * sin40° * sin20°.\n\nWhich is (sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°)^2. Therefore, the product is the square of (sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°). So if I can compute sin20° * sin40° * sin6", "answer": "\\frac{9}{256}"}

The problem is asking about the shape described by the equation z = c in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z). The options given are Line, Circle, Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what cylindrical coordinates are. Cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional coordinate system where each point is defined by a distance from the z-axis (r), an angle around the z-axis (θ), and a height (z). So, any point can be represented as (r, θ, z).\n\nNow, the equation given is z = c. That means that the height z is constant, right? So, no matter what r and θ are, the z-coordinate is always c. Let me visualize this. If I fix z at some constant value, say c, then in three-dimensional space, all the points where z = c would form a horizontal plane, right? Like, if c is 0, it's the xy-plane; if c is 5, it's a plane 5 units above the origin along the z-axis.\n\nBut wait, in cylindrical coordinates, the coordinates are (r, θ, z). So, even though r and θ can vary, z is fixed. So, for each fixed z = c, r and θ can take any value. That should describe a plane parallel to the xy-plane at height c. So, the shape is a plane. Let me check the options. Option C is Plane. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's think about other possibilities. If the equation had r = c, then that would be a cylinder with radius c around the z-axis, extending infinitely along the z-axis. If θ was fixed, then that would be a half-plane at that angle. But here, z is fixed. So, z = c is a plane. So, yeah, the answer should be C. Plane.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone confuses cylindrical coordinates with other coordinate systems. For example, if someone thought in terms of rectangles, but no, cylindrical coordinates are different. Alternatively, if someone thought that fixing z would restrict the coordinates to a circle, but no, in cylindrical coordinates, a circle would be if r is fixed and θ varies. But here, z is fixed, and r and θ can vary. So, it's a plane.\n\nSo, the equation z = c in cylindrical coordinates is a plane. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates describes all points where the height \\( z \\) is constant. Since \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) can take any values, this forms a horizontal plane parallel to the \\( xy \\)-plane at height \\( c \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{C}", "answer": "\\text{(C)}"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that the cross product of two vectors is related to both their magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them. The formula for the magnitude of the cross product is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ, where θ is the angle between them. \n\nFirst, let's compute the magnitude of the cross product given. The cross product vector is (3, 2, 6). To find its magnitude, I can use the formula sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Calculating that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those together: 9 + 4 + 36 = 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49) = 7. \n\nAlright, so ||a × b|| = 7. Now, according to the formula, this should equal ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so plugging those in: 7 = (2)(7) sinθ. Let's compute the right side: 2*7 is 14, so 14 sinθ = 7. Dividing both sides by 14 gives sinθ = 7/14 = 1/2. \n\nSo sinθ = 1/2. To find θ, we take the inverse sine of 1/2. The angle whose sine is 1/2 is 30 degrees, since sin(30°) = 1/2. But wait, sine is also positive in the second quadrant, so 150 degrees. However, since we are talking about the angle between two vectors, the angle between them must be between 0 and 180 degrees, right? So both 30 and 150 are possible. But the problem asks for the smallest possible angle. So between 30 and 150, 30 is smaller. Therefore, the smallest possible angle is 30 degrees. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything here. The cross product's direction is given by the right-hand rule, but the magnitude only depends on the sine of the angle. Since the magnitude is positive, sinθ is positive, which means θ is between 0 and 180 degrees. So θ could be 30° or 150°, but 30° is smaller. Therefore, the smallest possible angle is 30 degrees. \n\nIs there anything else I need to consider here? The problem says \"najmniejszyReachable\" angle, which I think just means the smallest possible, not considering other angles. So yes, 30 degrees is the answer. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nGiven ||a|| = 2, ||b|| = 7. Cross product magnitude is 7. Then ||a × b|| = 2*7*sinθ => 7 = 14 sinθ => sinθ = 0.5. θ = 30° or 150°, so 30° is the answer. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI think that's it. The key was remembering the formula for the magnitude of the cross product in terms of the sine of the angle between vectors. Then it's just solving for θ. No need to involve the cosine here because that relates to the dot product. The cross product relates to sine, so the angle is found using arcsin. Since we want the smallest angle, we take the acute angle solution. \n\nSo final answer is 30 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest possible angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) degrees.\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 2\\), \\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = 7\\), and their cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is also given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n7 = 14 \\sin \\theta \\implies \\sin \\theta = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) whose sine is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is either \\(30^\\circ\\) or \\(150^\\circ\\).

Hmm, let's start by recalling some algebra concepts here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any polynomial, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. Specifically, if we have a cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. Right? Because the formula Vieta's formula for a cubic is that the sum of the roots, r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/a. So in this case, f(x) is a cubic, so the sum of its roots is 49/1 = 49. Wait, let me check: the coefficients of f(x) are 1 for x³, -49 for x², 623 for x, and -2015 for the constant term. So yes, the sum of roots of f(x) is -(-49)/1 = 49. Got that.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for the sum of the roots of f(x); it's asking for the sum of the roots of g(x) = f(x + 5). So I need to figure out the sum of the roots of g(x). Let me think about how shifting the function affects its roots.\n\nIf g(x) = f(x + 5), then the roots of g(x) are the values of x for which f(x + 5) = 0. That means that x + 5 is a root of f(x). So if r is a root of f(x), then x = r - 5 would be a root of g(x). Therefore, each root of g(x) is 5 less than a root of f(x). So if the roots of f(x) are r1, r2, r3, then the roots of g(x) are r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15. Since we already know that r1 + r2 + r3 = 49, then the sum for g(x) would be 49 - 15 = 34. Is that right?\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way to be sure. Maybe by actually expanding g(x) and then applying Vieta's formula. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's write out g(x) = f(x + 5). So f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015. Let's expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (x + 5)³. Expanding that, we get x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.\n\nSecond term: -49(x + 5)². Let's expand (x + 5)² first: x² + 10x + 25. Multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225.\n\nThird term: 623(x + 5). That's 623x + 3115.\n\nFourth term: -2015, which is just -2015.\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\nFirst term: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125\n\nSecond term: -49x² - 490x - 1225\n\nThird term: +623x + 3115\n\nFourth term: -2015\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nx³ + (15x² - 49x²) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)\n\nLet's compute each coefficient:\n\nFor x³: 1x³\n\nFor x²: 15 - 49 = -34x²\n\nFor x: 75 - 490 + 623 = (75 + 623) - 490 = 698 - 490 = 208x\n\nConstant terms: 125 - 1225 = -1100; -1100 + 3115 = 2015; 2015 - 2015 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0. Wait, the constant term cancels out? That's interesting. So g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x.\n\nNow, applying Vieta's formula to g(x). The sum of the roots of g(x) is -b/a, where a is the coefficient of x³ (which is 1) and b is the coefficient of x² (which is -34). Therefore, the sum is -(-34)/1 = 34. So that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34. So the answer should be 34. But let me just double-check everything once more to be thorough.\n\nFirst, confirming the expansion of f(x + 5):\n\n(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125. Correct.\n\n-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225. Correct.\n\n623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115. Correct.\n\nThen combining all terms:\n\nx^3 +15x^2 +75x +125 -49x^2 -490x -1225 +623x +3115 -2015.\n\nGrouping like terms:\n\nx^3: 1x^3.\n\nx^2 terms: 15x^2 -49x^2 = -34x^2.\n\nx terms: 75x -490x +623x = (75 + 623 - 490)x = (698 - 490)x = 208x.\n\nConstants: 125 -1225 +3115 -2015.\n\nCalculating constants:\n\n125 -1225 = -1100\n\n-1100 +3115 = 2015\n\n2015 -2015 = 0. Perfect.\n\nSo g(x) is indeed x³ -34x² +208x. So the coefficients are 1, -34, 208, 0. Therefore, the sum of roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, as I did earlier, since shifting the function by replacing x with x + 5 shifts each root by -5, so the sum of roots shifts by -5 per root. Since there are three roots, the total shift is -15. So original sum is 49, new sum is 49 -15 = 34. Both methods confirm that the answer is 34.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the roots of the function \\( g \\) is \\boxed{34}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the roots of the function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\), where \\( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \\), we start by noting that the sum of the roots of \\( f(x) \\) can be determined using Vieta's formulas.

Let me think about these angles. 10°, 20°, 40°... They are each double the previous one.

For example, if we have angles that add up to a certain value, perhaps we can use some identity. Let's see:\n\n10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which doesn't seem particularly special. Alternatively, maybe these angles are related to a triangle? 10°, 50°, 70° sum to 130°, so maybe not part of a triangle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for \\(\\tan^2 \\theta\\). Let me recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, 10°, 50°, 70° sum to 130°, so not a triangle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these angles are related to a regular polygon? 10°, 50°, 70°... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are related to 30°, 60°, etc. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express these angles in terms of a common variable. Let me denote x = 10°, so 50° is 5x, and 70° is 7x.

So, maybe using the identity for tan(60° - θ) and tan(60° + θ).

Maybe we can compute tan^2 50° and tan^2 70° using these expressions and then add them up with tan^2 10°.\n\nLet me try that. Let’s denote θ = 10°, so:\n\nFirst, compute tan 50° = tan(60° - 10°):\n\n\\[\n\\tan 50° = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - \\tan 10°}{1 + \\sqrt{3} \\tan 10°}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, tan 70° = tan(60° + 10°):\n\n\\[\n\\tan 70° = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + \\tan 10°}{1 - \\sqrt{3} \\tan 10°}\n\\]\n\nSo, let me denote t = tan 10°, then:\n\ntan 50° = (sqrt(3) - t)/(1 + sqrt(3) t)\n\ntan 70° = (sqrt(3) + t)/(1 - sqrt(3) t)\n\nTherefore, tan^2 50° + tan^2 70° + tan^2 10° = [ (sqrt(3) - t)^2 / (1 + sqrt(3) t)^2 ] + [ (sqrt(3) + t)^2 / (1 - sqrt(3) t)^2 ] + t^2\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe simplifying each term:\n\nFirst, compute (sqrt(3) - t)^2 = 3 - 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2\n\nDenominator for tan^2 50°: (1 + sqrt(3) t)^2 = 1 + 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(3) + t)^2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2\n\nDenominator for tan^2 70°: (1 - sqrt(3) t)^2 = 1 - 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2\n\nSo, tan^2 50° = (3 - 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2)/(1 + 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2)\n\ntan^2 70° = (3 + 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2)/(1 - 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2)\n\nSo, adding tan^2 50° + tan^2 70°:\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nLet’s denote A = (3 - 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2)(1 - 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2) + (3 + 2 sqrt(3) t + t^2)(1 + 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2)\n\nDenominator D = (1 + 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2)(1 - 2 sqrt(3) t + 3 t^2) = (1 + 3 t^2)^2 - (2 sqrt(3) t)^2 = 1 + 6 t^2 + 9 t^4 - 12 t^2 = 1 - 6 t^2 + 9 t^4\n\nWait, let me compute D:\n\n(1 + sqrt(3) t)^2 * (1 - sqrt(3) t)^2 = [(1)^2 - (sqrt(3) t)^2]^2 = (1 - 3 t^2)^2 = 1 - 6 t^2 + 9 t^4.

Alright, first, I remember that the formula for the sum of interior angles of a convex polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So, if all the interior angles except one sum up to 1070 degrees, that means the total sum should be 1070 plus the missing angle. Let me write that down.\n\nLet’s denote the total number of sides as n. Then, the total sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180. The sum of all but one angle is 1070, so the missing angle would be (n-2)*180 - 1070. But since it's a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees. Therefore, the missing angle must be less than 180. So, we have:\n\n(n-2)*180 - 1070 < 180\n\nLet me solve this inequality. First, add 1070 to both sides:\n\n(n-2)*180 < 180 + 1070\n\n180n - 360 < 1250\n\nThen, add 360 to both sides:\n\n180n < 1250 + 360\n\n180n < 1610\n\nDivide both sides by 180:\n\nn < 1610 / 180\n\nCalculating that, 1610 divided by 180. Let's see:\n\n180*9 = 1620, which is more than 1610. So 1610 / 180 = 8.944... So n must be less than 8.944, which means n is 8 or less? Wait, but n must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 for a polygon. So if n is 8, let's check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's go through the steps again. The missing angle must be less than 180, so:\n\nTotal sum = (n-2)*180\n\nMissing angle = Total sum - 1070 < 180\n\nTherefore:\n\n(n-2)*180 - 1070 < 180\n\nSo, (n-2)*180 < 180 + 1070 = 1250\n\nThen, n-2 < 1250 / 180\n\n1250 divided by 180 is equal to 6.944...\n\nSo n-2 < 6.944...\n\nTherefore, n < 8.944...\n\nSo n must be 8. Because n has to be an integer. So n=8?\n\nWait, but let's check that. If n=8, then total sum is (8-2)*180=6*180=1080 degrees. Then, the missing angle would be 1080 - 1070=10 degrees. That's okay, since 10 is less than 180. So that works. But wait, is there another possible n?\n\nWait, maybe n could be 9? Let's check. If n=9, total sum is (9-2)*180=7*180=1260 degrees. Then, missing angle would be 1260 - 1070=190 degrees. But 190 is greater than 180, which is not allowed in a convex polygon. So n=9 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, n=7: total sum is (7-2)*180=5*180=900. Missing angle would be 900 - 1070= -170. Wait, that can't be. Negative angle? That doesn't make sense. So n=7 is too small. So n=8 is the only possible value.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let's think differently. The problem says \"sum of all its interior angles except one is 1070 degrees.\" So, the total sum is 1070 plus one angle. Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than 180. So, the total sum is 1070 + x, where x < 180.\n\nBut the total sum must also equal (n-2)*180. So, (n-2)*180 = 1070 + x. Since x is between 0 and 180 (but in reality, for a polygon, each interior angle is between 0 and 180, but actually, since it's a polygon, each interior angle must be greater than 0 and less than 180). So x is in (0, 180). Therefore, (n-2)*180 must be greater than 1070 and less than 1070 + 180 = 1250.\n\nSo, (n-2)*180 > 1070 and (n-2)*180 < 1250.\n\nTherefore, n-2 > 1070 / 180 ≈ 5.944...\n\nSo n-2 > 5.944, so n > 7.944. Since n must be an integer, n >=8.\n\nAnd n-2 < 1250 / 180 ≈6.944, so n-2 <6.944, so n <8.944. So n must be 8. Therefore, n=8.\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 8 sides. Let me verify again. For n=8, total sum is 1080. 1080 -1070=10, which is a valid interior angle. So that works.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check if n=8 is the only possible. Suppose n=10. Wait, no, n=10 would have total sum 10*180 - 360=1440. 1440 -1070=370. That's way over 180. So no. So n=8 is the only possible. So the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me check once more with n=8. Sum is 1080. If we take away 1070, the missing angle is 10. Which is valid. So that's okay. So the polygon is an octagon. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe convex polygon has \\boxed{8} sides.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \\(1070^\\circ\\), we start by noting that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \\(n\\) sides is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). \n\nGiven that the sum of all but one angle is \\(1070^\\circ\\), the missing angle must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\). Therefore, we have the inequality:\n\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180 - 1070 < 180\n\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n1. Add \\(1070\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   (n-2) \\times 180 < 1250\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by \\(180\\):\n   \\[\n   n - 2 < \\frac{1250}{180} \\approx 6.944\n   \\]\n\n3. Add \\(2\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   n < 8.944\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\(n\\) is \\(8\\). We verify this by checking the total sum of interior angles for \\(n = 8\\):\n\n- The total sum of interior angles is \\((8-2) \\times 180 = 1080^\\circ\\).\n- The missing angle is \\(1080 - 1070 = 10^\\circ\\), which is valid for a convex polygon.\n\nThus, the number of sides of the polygon is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).", "answer": "8"}

Hmm, let me try to understand what this means. \n\nFirst, modulus 23 means we're working with integers from 0 to 22, right? But the problem says 0 < t < 23, so t is in 1 to 22. And t has to be odd. Got it. Now, the inverse of t modulo 23 is a number s such that t * s ≡ 1 mod 23. The problem states that t + 2 is this inverse. So, essentially, t * (t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. \n\nLet me write that equation down: t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. Expanding that, we get t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23. Then, bringing the 1 to the left side: t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. So, we have a quadratic congruence here. \n\nQuadratic congruences can sometimes be solved by completing the square or using the quadratic formula, but since we're working modulo a prime (23 is prime), maybe there's a way to factor this or find solutions directly. Let me try to solve t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. \n\nFirst, let's complete the square. The coefficient of t is 2, so half of that is 1, and squaring it gives 1. So, t² + 2t + 1 - 1 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. That simplifies to (t + 1)² - 2 ≡ 0 mod 23. Therefore, (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. \n\nSo, we need to find t such that (t + 1) squared is congruent to 2 modulo 23. That means we need the square roots of 2 mod 23. Let me recall that in modular arithmetic, especially modulo primes, there are certain ways to compute square roots. \n\nFirst, check if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. To do this, we can use Euler's criterion, which states that a^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 mod p if a is a quadratic residue, and -1 otherwise. So, compute 2^11 mod 23. Let's calculate that:\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n2^4 = (2^2)^2 = 16\n\n2^8 = (2^4)^2 = 256 mod 23. Let's compute 256 divided by 23. 23*11=253, so 256 - 253 = 3. So 2^8 ≡ 3 mod 23.\n\nThen, 2^11 = 2^8 * 2^2 * 2^1 ≡ 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. So, since 2^11 ≡ 1 mod 23, 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. Therefore, there are solutions for x² ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nNow, how to find the square roots? One way is trial and error. Let me try numbers from 1 to 22 and see which ones squared give 2 mod 23.\n\nLet's start with x = 3: 3² = 9 ≡ 9 mod 23. Not 2.\n\nx = 5: 25 ≡ 2 mod 23. Oh, wait, 5² = 25, and 25 - 23 = 2. So 5² ≡ 2 mod 23. Therefore, 5 and -5 (which is 18 mod 23) are the square roots of 2 mod 23. \n\nSo, (t + 1) ≡ 5 mod 23 or (t + 1) ≡ 18 mod 23. \n\nTherefore, solving for t:\n\nCase 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 => t ≡ 4 mod 23. But t needs to be odd and between 0 and 23. 4 is even, so this is invalid.\n\nCase 2: t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 => t ≡ 17 mod 23. 17 is odd and within the required range. \n\nTherefore, t = 17 is a solution. Let's verify this. \n\nCompute t + 2 = 17 + 2 = 19. Now check if 17 * 19 ≡ 1 mod 23. \n\n17 * 19 = 323. Let's divide 323 by 23. 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. Therefore, 323 ≡ 1 mod 23. Perfect, that works. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"unialna [unique] liczbę całkowitą t\", so is this the only solution? Let's check if there are other solutions. \n\nWe found t ≡ 17 mod 23 and t ≡ 4 mod 23. But t must be between 0 and 23, and odd. 4 is even, so only 17 is valid. So yes, 17 is the unique solution. \n\nBut let me double-check to ensure that there are no other possible solutions. Sometimes, in modulus, especially with quadratics, there can be two solutions, but in this case, since we had t ≡ 17 and t ≡ 4, and only 17 is odd, so that's the only one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check other numbers just to be thorough. Let's list all odd numbers between 1 and 22 and compute t(t + 2) mod 23:\n\nt = 1: 1*3=3 ≡3≠1\n\nt=3: 3*5=15≡15≠1\n\nt=5:5*7=35≡35-23=12≡12≠1\n\nt=7:7*9=63≡63-2*23=63-46=17≡17≠1\n\nt=9:9*11=99≡99-4*23=99-92=7≡7≠1\n\nt=11:11*13=143≡143-6*23=143-138=5≡5≠1\n\nt=13:13*15=195≡195-8*23=195-184=11≡11≠1\n\nt=15:15*17=255≡255-11*23=255-253=2≡2≠1\n\nt=17:17*19=323≡1 as before. Correct.\n\nt=19:19*21=399≡399-17*23=399-391=8≡8≠1\n\nt=21:21*23=483≡483-21*23=483-483=0≡0≠1\n\nSo, indeed, only t=17 gives the product congruent to 1 mod23. Therefore, 17 is the unique solution. \n\nJust to make sure, maybe check if there's another way the equation could be satisfied. For instance, maybe using the quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic equation is t² + 2t -1 ≡0 mod23. The quadratic formula is t = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a) mod p. Here, a=1, b=2, c=-1. So discriminant D = b² -4ac = 4 +4 =8. So sqrt(8) mod23. \n\nBut 8 mod23 is 8, and we already know that sqrt(8) mod23 is sqrt(2*4) = 2*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 5 or 18, so sqrt(8) would be 2*5=10 or 2*18=36≡13 mod23. Wait, but 10²=100≡100-4*23=100-92=8. Yes, 10²=80≡8 mod23. Similarly, 13²=169≡169-7*23=169-161=8 mod23. So sqrt(8) is 10 or 13 mod23. \n\nTherefore, the solutions would be t = [-2 ±10]/2 mod23 and t = [-2 ±13]/2 mod23. Let's compute both:\n\nFirst solution: [-2 +10]/2 = 8/2 =4 mod23. \n\nSecond solution: [-2 -10]/2 = (-12)/2 = -6 ≡17 mod23. \n\nThird solution: [-2 +13]/2 =11/2 mod23. Hmm, 11/2 mod23. Since 2^{-1} mod23 is 12, because 2*12=24≡1 mod23. So 11*12=132≡132-5*23=132-115=17 mod23. \n\nFourth solution: [-2 -13]/2 = (-15)/2 ≡ (-15)*12 mod23. (-15)*12= -180≡-180 + 8*23= -180+184=4 mod23. \n\nSo the solutions are t=4,17,17,4 mod23. So t=4 and t=17. But t must be odd, so only t=17 is valid. \n\nTherefore, this confirms that the only solution is t=17. \n\nJust to recap: We started with the equation t(t + 2) ≡1 mod23, transformed it into a quadratic congruence, solved it by completing the square and finding square roots, checked via trial and error, and confirmed with the quadratic formula. All methods lead to t=17, which is the unique odd integer between 0 and23 satisfying the condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unique odd integer \\( t \\) is \\boxed{17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find a unique odd integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 0 < t < 23 \\) and \\( t + 2 \\) is the inverse of \\( t \\) modulo 23, we start with the equation:\n\n\\[ t(t + 2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23} \\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23} \\]\n\nCompleting the square, we rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ (t + 1)^2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23} \\]\n\\[ (t + 1)^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23} \\]\n\nWe need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23.

The problem is asking for the total surface area in square cubits of a cube that has a volume of 1 cubic cubit. Hmm, I need to remember how to relate volume and surface area for a cube. \n\nFirst, for a cube, the volume is calculated by side length cubed. So if the volume is 1 cubic cubit, that means each edge of the cube must be 1 cubit long, right? Because 1 cubit times 1 cubit times 1 cubit is 1 cubic cubit. \n\nNow, the surface area of a cube is calculated by 6 times the area of one face. Since a cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The area of one face is the side length squared. So if the side length is 1 cubit, then the area of one face is 1 cubit squared. \n\nTherefore, the total surface area would be 6 times 1 cubit squared, which is 6 square cubits. \n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Volume is side^3 = 1, so side = 1. Surface area is 6*(side^2) = 6*(1^2) = 6. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there any trick here? The problem mentions \"cubits\" and \"square cubits\", but I think that's just the unit.

Hmm, let me remember what the conjugate of a radical expression is. I think it's similar to conjugates in algebra, right? For example, if you have a binomial with a radical term, the conjugate would be the same binomial but with the sign between the terms flipped. So, if the original number is a + b√c, then its conjugate would be a - b√c. In this case, the number is 5 + √3. So, the conjugate should be 5 - √3. \n\nNow, the problem says to find the product of the original number and its conjugate. That sounds like multiplying (5 + √3) by (5 - √3). I remember that when you multiply conjugates, the result is a difference of squares. The formula is (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Let me apply that here. \n\nSo, substituting a with 5 and b with √3, the product would be 5² minus (√3)². Calculating each term: 5 squared is 25, and (√3) squared is just 3, because squaring a square root cancels them out. Then, subtracting these gives 25 - 3, which equals 22. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do the multiplication step by step without using the difference of squares formula to verify. \n\nFirst, multiply (5 + √3)(5 - √3). Using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst terms: 5 * 5 = 25\n\nOuter terms: 5 * (-√3) = -5√3\n\nInner terms: √3 * 5 = 5√3\n\nLast terms: √3 * (-√3) = - (√3 * √3) = -3\n\nNow, adding all these terms together:\n\n25 - 5√3 + 5√3 - 3\n\nThe middle terms, -5√3 and +5√3, cancel each other out. So, we're left with 25 - 3 = 22. \n\nOkay, so both methods give the same result. That confirms that the product is indeed 22. Therefore, the answer should be 22. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to think about this. For instance, using the formula for the product of a number and its conjugate in the context of radical expressions. The conjugate in this case is defined to eliminate the radical when multiplied, which is exactly what we did here. So, it's a standard approach when dealing with radicals. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recall the difference of squares formula, I could still compute the product manually as I did above. Either way, the result is the same. \n\nSo, I'm confident that the product of 5 + √3 and its conjugate 5 - √3 is 22. Therefore, the answer is 22.\n</think>\n\nTo find the product of \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and its conjugate \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\), we use the difference of squares formula: \\[(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2.\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{3}\\).

Let me think about how sequences work here. Each term seems to be increasing by 2. That makes sense because odd numbers are two units apart. So, starting from 1, adding 2 each time gives the next odd number.\n\nLet me recall if there's a formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. Yes, the formula is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. In this case, a_1 is 1, and the common difference d is 2. So, plugging into the formula, the nth term should be 1 + (n - 1)*2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few terms to make sure. For n = 1: 1 + (1 - 1)*2 = 1 + 0 = 1, which is correct. For n = 2: 1 + (2 - 1)*2 = 1 + 2 = 3, also correct. n = 3: 1 + 4 = 5, yes. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, to find the 2003rd term, I just need to substitute n = 2003 into the formula. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, calculate (2003 - 1)*2. That's 2002*2. Let me do that multiplication. 2000*2 is 4000, and 2*2 is 4, so 4000 + 4 = 4004. Then add 1 to that result: 4004 + 1 = 4005. So, the 2003rd term should be 4005.\n\nWait, let me verify that again step by step. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let's see:\n\n2003 - 1 = 2002. Then 2002 multiplied by 2. Breaking it down: 2000*2 = 4000, 2*2 = 4, so 4000 + 4 = 4004. Then add the first term, which is 1: 4004 + 1 = 4005. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the nth odd number is given by 2n - 1. Let me check that formula. For n = 1: 2*1 -1 = 1, correct. n = 2: 4 -1 = 3, correct. n = 3: 6 -1 =5, correct. So this formula also works. Then for the 2003rd term, it would be 2*2003 -1. Let's compute that.\n\n2*2003: 2000*2=4000, 3*2=6, so 4000 +6=4006. Then subtract 1: 4006 -1=4005. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, both formulas give the same answer. So the 2003rd term is 4005. I think that's solid. Let me just check with another approach. If I list out the first few terms:\n\nTerm 1: 1 = 2*1 -1 =1\n\nTerm 2: 3 =2*2 -1=3\n\nTerm 3:5=2*3 -1=5\n\n...\n\nTerm n: 2n -1\n\nSo, for term number k, it's 2k -1. Therefore, term 2003 is 2*2003 -1=4006 -1=4005. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about how many steps you take from the first term. The first term is 1. To get to the 2nd term, you add 2 once. To get to the 3rd term, you add 2 twice. So, to get to the nth term, you add 2, (n-1) times. So the nth term is 1 + 2*(n-1). Which is the same as 2n -1. So, again, 2*2003 -1=4005.\n\nAll these methods converge to the same answer. So I'm confident that the 2003rd term is 4005.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 2003rd term is \\boxed{4005}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.

The function f(x) is given as 2x minus 3. So substituting 5 into that function, it would be 2 times 5 minus 3. Let me calculate that. 2 times 5 is 10, and then subtract 3, so that gives me 7. So f(5) is 7. \n\nNow, the problem says g(f(5) - 1). Wait, so instead of just g(f(5)), it's g(f(5) minus 1). So I need to subtract 1 from f(5) first. Since f(5) is 7, subtracting 1 gives me 6. So now I need to find g(6). \n\nThe function g(x) is x plus 1. So substituting 6 into g(x) would be 6 plus 1, which is 7. Therefore, the value of g(f(5) - 1) should be 7.

Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that arccot(1/x) is the same as arctan(x) if x is positive, right? Wait, let me think. The arccotangent and arctangent functions are related. For any x, arccot(x) = arctan(1/x) when x > 0, but if x < 0, arccot(x) = arctan(1/x) + π. But in this case, it's arccot(1/x), so maybe substituting y = 1/x might help. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote θ = arctan(x). Then, tanθ = x. What is arccot(1/x)? Let's set φ = arccot(1/x). Then, cotφ = 1/x, which means tanφ = x. So φ = arctan(x) when 1/x is positive, which is when x > 0. But if x < 0, then 1/x is negative, so arccot(1/x) would be arctan(x) + π. Wait, but arccotangent usually has a range of (0, π), whereas arctangent has (-π/2, π/2). So maybe arccot(1/x) is equal to arctan(x) when x > 0, and arctan(x) + π when x < 0. Hmm, I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can relate arctan(x) and arccot(1/x). Let me recall that arctan(x) + arccot(x) = π/2 for x > 0. But here, it's arctan(x) + arccot(1/x). Let me see. If I let θ = arctan(x), then tanθ = x. Then arccot(1/x) would be arctan(x) because cot(φ) = 1/x implies tan(φ) = x, so φ = arctan(x). But this is only true if 1/x is positive, i.e., x > 0. If x < 0, then 1/x is negative, so arccot(1/x) would be arctan(x) + π. Wait, but arccot(1/x) is defined to be in (0, π), so if 1/x is negative, then arccot(1/x) would be in (π/2, π). Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the principal values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arctan(x) and arccot(1/x). Let me check for x > 0. If x > 0, then arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). For x < 0, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. Is that right? Let me test with x = 1. Then arctan(1) = π/4, and arccot(1) = π/4 as well, since cot(π/4) = 1. So for x = 1, they are equal. If x = -1, arctan(-1) = -π/4, but arccot(-1) would be in (0, π), so arccot(-1) = 3π/4. And arctan(-1) + π = -π/4 + π = 3π/4. So yes, for x < 0, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, depending on the sign of x, the expression arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) simplifies differently. If x > 0, then arccot(1/x) = arctan(x), so the sum is arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). If x < 0, then arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π, so the sum is arctan(x) + arctan(x) + π = 2 arctan(x) + π. So the equation becomes sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3 when x > 0, and sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = 1/3 when x < 0. Let me check sin(2 arctan(x) + π). Since sin(θ + π) = -sinθ, so sin(2 arctan(x) + π) = -sin(2 arctan(x)). So the equation for x < 0 is -sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3, which implies sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nSo we can split the problem into two cases: x > 0 and x < 0. Let's handle them separately.\n\nCase 1: x > 0. Then sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.\n\nCase 2: x < 0. Then sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nLet me handle Case 1 first. Let θ = arctan(x), so x = tanθ, and θ is in (0, π/2) since x > 0. Then 2θ is in (0, π). So sin(2θ) = 1/3. We can solve for θ.\n\nsin(2θ) = 1/3. So 2θ = arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = π - arcsin(1/3). Therefore, θ = (1/2) arcsin(1/3) or θ = (π - arcsin(1/3))/2. Then x = tanθ. So x = tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] or x = tan[(π - arcsin(1/3))/2].\n\nLet me compute these values. Let's first compute tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)]. Let me set α = arcsin(1/3), so sinα = 1/3, and α is in (0, π/2). Then tan(α/2) can be found using the identity tan(α/2) = sinα / (1 + cosα). Since sinα = 1/3, cosα = sqrt(1 - (1/3)^2) = sqrt(8/9) = 2√2/3. Therefore, tan(α/2) = (1/3) / (1 + 2√2/3) = (1/3) / [(3 + 2√2)/3] = 1 / (3 + 2√2). Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2√2): [1*(3 - 2√2)] / [(3 + 2√2)(3 - 2√2)] = (3 - 2√2) / (9 - 8) = (3 - 2√2)/1 = 3 - 2√2. So tan(α/2) = 3 - 2√2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other solution: θ = (π - α)/2. Let's compute tan[(π - α)/2]. Using the identity tan[(π - α)/2] = cot(α/2). Since cot(α/2) = 1 / tan(α/2) = 1 / (3 - 2√2) = (3 + 2√2)/[(3 - 2√2)(3 + 2√2)] = (3 + 2√2)/1 = 3 + 2√2. Alternatively, using tan[(π - α)/2] = tan(π/2 - α/2) = cot(α/2) = 1/tan(α/2). So yes, that's 3 + 2√2.\n\nTherefore, for x > 0, the solutions are x = 3 - 2√2 and x = 3 + 2√2.\n\nNow, moving to Case 2: x < 0. Then sin(2 arctan(x)) = -1/3.\n\nSimilarly, let θ = arctan(x). Since x < 0, θ is in (-π/2, 0). Then 2θ is in (-π, 0). So sin(2θ) = -1/3. Therefore, 2θ = -arcsin(1/3) or 2θ = -π + arcsin(1/3). Therefore, θ = - (1/2) arcsin(1/3) or θ = (-π + arcsin(1/3))/2. Then x = tanθ.\n\nFirst solution: θ = - (1/2) arcsin(1/3). Then tanθ = tan(- (1/2) arcsin(1/3)) = - tan[(1/2) arcsin(1/3)] = - (3 - 2√2) = 2√2 - 3.\n\nSecond solution: θ = (-π + arcsin(1/3))/2. Let's compute tanθ. Let me set φ = arcsin(1/3), so sinφ = 1/3, φ is in (0, π/2). Then θ = (-π + φ)/2. Let me compute tanθ. Let me use the identity tan[(A - B)/2] = (tan A - tan B)/(1 + tan A tan B), but maybe it's easier to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that θ = (-π + φ)/2. Let me write this as θ = -π/2 + φ/2. Then tanθ = tan(-π/2 + φ/2). Using the identity tan(-π/2 + a) = -cot(a). So tan(-π/2 + φ/2) = -cot(φ/2). So we need to compute cot(φ/2) where φ = arcsin(1/3).\n\nAgain, using the identity cot(φ/2) = (1 + cosφ)/sinφ. Since φ = arcsin(1/3), sinφ = 1/3, cosφ = 2√2/3. Therefore, cot(φ/2) = (1 + 2√2/3)/(1/3) = ( (3 + 2√2)/3 ) / (1/3 ) = 3 + 2√2. Therefore, tanθ = - (3 + 2√2). So x = tanθ = - (3 + 2√2).\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x < 0 are x = 2√2 - 3 and x = - (3 + 2√2).\n\nBut wait, let me check if these solutions are valid. For example, when x < 0, we have to make sure that arccot(1/x) is correctly calculated. Since x is negative, 1/x is also negative. So arccot(1/x) should be in (π/2, π). However, when we derived the expressions, we considered arccot(1/x) = arctan(x) + π. So since x < 0, arctan(x) is negative, and adding π would put it in (π/2, π). So that's correct. Therefore, the steps are valid.\n\nNow, let's check if these solutions actually satisfy the original equation. Let's take x = 3 - 2√2, which is approximately 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, so positive. Then arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) = 2 arctan(x). Let's compute sin(2 arctan(x)). Let me compute arctan(x). Let θ = arctan(3 - 2√2). Then tanθ = 3 - 2√2. Compute sin(2θ) = 2 tanθ / (1 + tan²θ). Let's compute tanθ = 3 - 2√2. Then tan²θ = (3 - 2√2)^2 = 9 - 12√2 + 8 = 17 - 12√2. Therefore, 1 + tan²θ = 18 - 12√2. Then sin(2θ) = 2*(3 - 2√2) / (18 - 12√2). Let's compute numerator: 6 - 4√2. Denominator: 18 - 12√2. Factor numerator and denominator: numerator is 2*(3 - 2√2), denominator is 6*(3 - 2√2). So sin(2θ) = 2*(3 - 2√2) / [6*(3 - 2√2)] = 2/6 = 1/3. Correct. Similarly for x = 3 + 2√2, which is approximately 5.828. Then 2θ = 2 arctan(3 + 2√2). Compute sin(2θ). Let tanθ = 3 + 2√2. Then tan²θ = (3 + 2√2)^2 = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2. So 1 + tan²θ = 18 + 12√2. Then sin(2θ) = 2*(3 + 2√2)/(18 + 12√2) = 2*(3 + 2√2)/(6*(3 + 2√2)) = 2/6 = 1/3. Correct.\n\nNow for the negative solutions: x = 2√2 - 3 ≈ 2.828 - 3 ≈ -0.172. Then arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) = 2 arctan(x) + π. Let θ = arctan(x). Then sin(2θ + π) = sin(2θ)cosπ + cos(2θ)sinπ = -sin(2θ). So we need to compute -sin(2θ). Let's compute sin(2θ) where θ = arctan(2√2 - 3). Let tanθ = 2√2 - 3. Compute sin(2θ) using the same formula: sin(2θ) = 2 tanθ / (1 + tan²θ). Let's compute tanθ = 2√2 - 3. Then tan²θ = (2√2 - 3)^2 = 8 - 12√2 + 9 = 17 - 12√2. Then 1 + tan²θ = 18 - 12", "answer": "3 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2}"}

Let me try to figure out how to approach this. First, let me recall what defines a line in three dimensions. A line can be defined parametrically with a point and a direction vector. The problem gives me two lines:\n\nThe first line is given by the vector equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAnd the second line is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThey mention that these two lines are parallel. Hmm, wait, the problem says they are parallel, so I don't need to check that. But maybe I should confirm that their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other? Let me check. The direction vector of the first line is (2, -9, -2), and the second line is (4, -18, -4). If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get (4, -18, -4), which is exactly the direction vector of the second line. So yes, they are parallel. That makes sense.\n\nNow, since the lines are parallel, the distance between them can be found using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. I remember that in 3D, the distance between two parallel lines is the length of the cross product of the direction vectors of the lines (wait, no, maybe not exactly) divided by the magnitude of the direction vector? Or maybe it's the area of the parallelogram formed by the two lines? Hmm, I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the shortest distance between the two lines. Since they are parallel, the shortest distance will be along a line that is perpendicular to both. So, if I can find a vector that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line and is perpendicular to both direction vectors, then the length of that vector will be the distance between the lines.\n\nLet me formalize that. Let’s denote the first line as Line 1: \\(\\vec{r}_1 = \\vec{a}_1 + t \\vec{d}_1\\) and the second line as Line 2: \\(\\vec{r}_2 = \\vec{a}_2 + u \\vec{d}_2\\). Since the lines are parallel, \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{d}_2\\) are scalar multiples. Let's assume \\(\\vec{d}_2 = k \\vec{d}_1\\) for some scalar k. In this case, we saw k=2.\n\nThe vector connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2 is \\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1\\). But to find the shortest distance, we need the component of this vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors. However, since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors are the same up to scaling, so the cross product of the direction vectors would give a vector perpendicular to both. Wait, the cross product of \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{d}_2\\) would be a vector perpendicular to both. But since they are parallel, their cross product should be zero, which makes sense because the lines are parallel and don't intersect, so the distance can be calculated using the formula involving the cross product of the direction vectors and the vector connecting any two points on the lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the formula for the distance between two skew lines. But since these lines are parallel, the formula simplifies. For parallel lines, the distance is equal to the length of the projection of the vector connecting any two points on the lines onto a vector perpendicular to both lines. Since the lines are parallel, the direction vector is the same, so the cross product of the direction vector with itself is zero, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for two parallel lines, the distance between them is the same as the distance from any point on one line to the other line. So, if I take a point on Line 1, say \\(\\vec{a}_1\\), then the distance from \\(\\vec{a}_1\\) to Line 2 is the minimal distance between them. The formula for the distance from a point to a line in 3D is |(\\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1\\) ) × \\(\\vec{d}_1\\)| / |\\(\\vec{d}_1\\)|. Wait, but since the lines are parallel, this formula still applies because the cross product will give a vector perpendicular to the direction of the lines. Let me verify.\n\nYes, the distance from a point to a line in 3D is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vector from the point to any point on the line and the direction vector of the line, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. So in this case, since Line 2 is parallel to Line 1, the direction vector is the same for both lines (up to scaling). Therefore, the distance from Line 1 to Line 2 is |(\\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1\\) ) × \\(\\vec{d}_1\\)| / |\\(\\vec{d}_1\\)|.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross product of the direction vectors is zero (because they are parallel), but that's only if we take the cross product of the direction vectors. Wait, no. Wait, if the lines are parallel, then the cross product of their direction vectors is a zero vector, but when calculating the distance, we need the cross product of the direction vector with the vector connecting the two lines. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me check the formula again. The distance between two skew lines is |(\\(\\vec{b}_1 - \\vec{a}_1\\) ) · ( \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) × \\(\\vec{d}_2\\) )| / | \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) × \\(\\vec{d}_2\\) |. But when the lines are parallel, \\(\\vec{d}_1 × \\(\\vec{d}_2\\) is zero, so this formula doesn't work. Therefore, for parallel lines, the distance is calculated differently.\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the distance between them is the minimal distance between any two points on the lines. To compute this, we can take the vector connecting a point from each line, \\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1\\), and find its component that is perpendicular to the direction of the lines. Since the lines are parallel, this perpendicular component is the same regardless of which points we take. So the formula is |(\\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1\\) ) × \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) | / | \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) |.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me confirm with a quick example. Suppose we have two parallel lines in 2D, separated by some distance. The formula would be similar. The cross product in 2D can be thought of as the determinant, which gives the area. So the distance would be the area of the parallelogram formed by the vector between the points and the direction vector, divided by the length of the direction vector. Which is the same as the height of the parallelogram, hence the distance.\n\nTherefore, applying this formula here should give the correct distance. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, identify \\(\\vec{a}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{a}_2\\), which are points on each line. From the given equations:\n\nLine 1: \\(\\vec{a}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nLine 2: \\(\\vec{a}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nDirection vector for both lines: \\(\\vec{d}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (since Line 2's direction vector is a scalar multiple, and we can use the same direction vector for both).\n\nCompute the vector connecting \\(\\vec{a}_1\\) to \\(\\vec{a}_2\\):\n\n\\(\\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\\\ -3 - (-10) \\\\ 6 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nNow, compute the cross product of this connecting vector with the direction vector \\(\\vec{d}_1\\):\n\nLet me denote \\(\\vec{v} = \\vec{a}_2 - \\vec{a}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\n\\(\\vec{d}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nThe cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{d}_1\\) is calculated as follows:\n\nUsing the determinant formula:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{d}_1 = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n-8 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n2 & -9 & -2 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\ni*(7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) - j*(-8*(-2) - 5*2) + k*(-8*(-9) - 7*2)\n\nLet's compute each component:\n\ni-component: 7*(-2) - 5*(-9) = -14 + 45 = 31\n\nj-component: - [ (-8)*(-2) - 5*2 ] = - [16 - 10] = -6\n\nk-component: (-8)*(-9) - 7*2 = 72 - 14 = 58\n\nSo, \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{d}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 31 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 58 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is:\n\n| \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{d}_1\\) | = \\(\\sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2}\\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n31² = 961\n\n(-6)² = 36\n\n58² = 3364\n\nSum: 961 + 36 + 3364 = 961 + 36 = 997; 997 + 3364 = 4361\n\nSo, the magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{4361}\\). Let me check that addition again:\n\n31² is 961, 58² is 3364. 961 + 3364 is 4325, then +36 is 4361. Yes, correct.\n\nNow, the magnitude of the direction vector \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) is:\n\n| \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) | = \\(\\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{89}\\)\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two lines is | \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{d}_1\\) | / | \\(\\vec{d}_1\\) | = \\(\\sqrt{4361}/\\sqrt{89}\\)\n\nBut let me simplify this expression. Since \\(\\sqrt{4361}/\\sqrt{89}\\) can be written as \\(\\sqrt{4361/89}\\). Let me compute 4361 divided by 89.\n\nLet me check: 89*49 = 89*50 - 89 = 4450 - 89 = 4361. Yes! So 4361 / 89 = 49. Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{4361}/\\sqrt{89} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\\)\n\nWow, that's a nice simplification. So the distance is 7 units. Let me verify once more.\n\nWait, 89*49 is indeed 4361. Let me compute 89*50: 89*50 = 4450. Then subtract 89: 4450 - 89 = 4361. Correct. Therefore, 4361 divided by 89 is 49. So sqrt(49) is 7. Therefore, the distance is 7.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two parallel lines is 7.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the cross product calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nGiven \\(\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\vec{d}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nCross product components:\n\ni: (7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) = (-14 + 45) = 31\n\nj: - [ (-8*(-2) - 5*2) ] = - [ 16 - 10 ] = -6\n\nk: (-8*(-9) - 7*2) = 72 - 14 = 58\n\nSo cross product is (31, -6, 58). Then the magnitude squared is 31² + (-6)^2 + 58² = 961 + 36 + 3364 = 4361. Correct. Then divided by |d1| which is sqrt(89). Then sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89) = sqrt(4361/89) = sqrt(49) =7. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe distance between the two lines is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the distance between the two parallel lines given, we start by identifying the points and direction vectors of each line.

Hmm, let me visualize this first. The rectangle is centered at the origin because the x-coordinates range from -5 to 5 and the y-coordinates from -4 to 4. But since the vertices are at those points, the sides are parallel to the axes. So the rectangle is 10 units wide along the x-axis and 8 units tall along the y-axis.\n\nNow, the question is about points that are strictly inside this rectangle. That means points that are not on the boundary. So I need to count all the points (x,y) where x is between -5 and 5, but not including -5 and 5, and y is between -4 and 4, not including -4 and 4. Wait, but actually, when dealing with integer coordinates, the boundaries would be the lines x=-5, x=5, y=-4, and y=4. So strictly inside would mean x must be greater than -5 and less than 5, and y must be greater than -4 and less than 4. But since x and y are integers, this translates to x ranging from -4 to 4 inclusive, and y ranging from -3 to 3 inclusive. Let me check that.\n\nIf x has to be strictly greater than -5 and strictly less than 5, the integer values x can take are -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 values. Similarly, for y, strictly greater than -4 and strictly less than 4, so y can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 values. Then the total number of points would be 9 multiplied by 7, which is 63. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So for x: from -4 to 4, that's (4 - (-4)) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. For y: from -3 to 3, that's (3 - (-3)) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. So 9*7=63. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach. The rectangle spans from x=-5 to x=5. The integer points on the x-axis here would be from x=-4 to x=4, as those are inside. Similarly, for y from -3 to 3. So yes, 9*7=63. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should use the formula for the number of lattice points strictly inside a rectangle. I remember there's a formula related to the area and the perimeter, but maybe that's for including the boundary. Let me recall Pick's theorem. Pick's theorem states that the area A of a simple polygon with integer coordinates is given by A = I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. But in this case, the problem is asking for the number of interior points, so if I can compute the area and the number of boundary points, I can use Pick's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area of the rectangle. The width is from x=-5 to x=5, so that's 10 units. The height is from y=-4 to y=4, so that's 8 units. Therefore, the area is 10*8=80.\n\nNow, let's compute B, the number of boundary points. The boundary consists of the four sides. Let's compute each side:\n\n1. Top side: from (-5,4) to (5,4). The number of integer points on this line is the number of integers from -5 to 5 inclusive. Wait, but since x ranges from -5 to 5, but on the top boundary y=4. But the top boundary is from x=-5 to x=5, but strictly speaking, the boundary points here include all points where y=4 and x between -5 and 5. But integer x from -5 to 5 inclusive. That's 11 points (from -5 to 5 inclusive). Wait, but the problem says strictly inside, but for the boundary points, they include the edges. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for points strictly inside the rectangle. So maybe B is the number of boundary points, which includes the edges, and then using Pick's theorem, we can find I.\n\nBut let's confirm. For the top side, y=4, x from -5 to 5. The integer points here are x=-5,-4,...,5. That's 11 points. Similarly, the bottom side y=-4, x from -5 to 5, also 11 points. The left side x=-5, y from -4 to 4. That's 9 points (from y=-4 to y=4 inclusive). Similarly, the right side x=5, y from -4 to 4, 9 points. So total boundary points B = 11 + 11 + 9 + 9 = 40.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any overlapping points. For example, the corners are counted in both sides. For instance, (-5,4) is on the top-left corner and is part of the top side and left side. But since we are counting each side separately, those corner points would be counted twice. However, in the formula for B, which is the number of boundary lattice points, each corner is only counted once. Wait, no. Wait, when you count the top side as 11 points, it includes (-5,4) and (5,4). Similarly, the left side includes (-5,-4) and (-5,4). So the four corners are each counted twice. Therefore, B is actually 11 + 11 + 9 + 9 = 40, but subtracting the 4 corners that are counted twice. So 40 - 4 = 36. Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, let's think. Each side is a line segment. The top and bottom sides each have 11 points (from x=-5 to x=5 inclusive). The left and right sides each have 9 points (from y=-4 to y=4 inclusive). However, the four corners are each shared by two sides. So when we add up all four sides, we have counted each corner twice. Therefore, total boundary points B = (11 + 11 + 9 + 9) - 4*1 = 40 - 4 = 36. Because each corner is counted twice, so we subtract 4 duplicates.\n\nSo B = 36. Then, using Pick's theorem, A = I + B/2 -1. So 80 = I + 36/2 -1 => 80 = I + 18 -1 => 80 = I +17 => I = 80 -17 = 63. Which matches the previous result. So that's reassuring. Therefore, the number of interior points is 63. So the answer should be 63.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the boundary points. Let me recount.\n\nTop side: x from -5 to 5 inclusive. That's 5 - (-5) +1 = 11 points.\n\nBottom side: same as top, 11 points.\n\nLeft side: y from -4 to 4 inclusive. That's 4 - (-4) +1 = 9 points.\n\nRight side: same as left, 9 points.\n\nTotal if counted separately: 11+11+9+9=40.\n\nBut the four corners are each counted twice. Each corner is a lattice point. So the four corners are (-5,4), (5,4), (5,-4), (-5,-4). Each of these four points is counted in two sides. So total overcount is 4 points. So subtract 4 to get the actual number of boundary points. Therefore, B=40-4=36.\n\nThen Pick's theorem: A = I + B/2 -1 => 80 = I + 18 -1 => 80 = I +17 => I=63. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use Pick's theorem, and just counted the interior points directly, as I did earlier, x from -4 to 4 inclusive (9 values) and y from -3 to 3 inclusive (7 values). 9*7=63. So both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 63. So the number of integer points strictly inside the rectangle is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integer points strictly inside the rectangle is \\boxed{63}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangular area with vertices at \\((5,4)\\), \\((-5,4)\\), \\((-5,-4)\\), and \\((5,-4)\\), we first note that the rectangle is centered at the origin with a width of 10 units (from \\(x = -5\\) to \\(x = 5\\)) and a height of 8 units (from \\(y = -4\\) to \\(y = 4\\)).\n\nStrictly inside the rectangle means we exclude the boundary points.

The given cross products are a×b, a×c, and b×c. Hmm, cross products have some properties that might be useful here, like distributivity over vector addition and scalar multiplication. Let me recall those properties.\n\nFirst, the cross product is distributive over addition. That means (u + v) × w = u×w + v×w, and similarly for the other vector. Also, scalar multiplication can be factored out: (k*u) × v = k*(u×v) where k is a scalar. So, maybe I can expand (2b - a) × (3c + a) using these properties.\n\nLet me write that out step by step. Let's denote the vectors as a, b, c. The expression is (2b - a) × (3c + a). Let's expand this cross product.\n\nFirst, expand the cross product as if it's (u + v) × w where u = 2b - a, v = -a, and w = 3c + a. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently. Alternatively, since cross product is bilinear, we can distribute both terms. So:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n2b × 3c = 6 (b × c)\n\n2b × a = 2 (b × a)\n\n- a × 3c = -3 (a × c)\n\n- a × a = 0 (since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) + 0\n\nNow, note that b × a is equal to - (a × b), right? Because cross product is anti-commutative. Similarly, a × c is given, and b × c is given. Let's substitute those known cross products.\n\nFirst, let's handle each term:\n\n6(b × c) = 6 times the given vector [1, -7, 18]\n\n2(b × a) = 2*(- (a × b)) = -2*(a × b) = -2 times [6, -7, 3]\n\n-3(a × c) = -3 times [4, 7, 2]\n\nSo let's compute each of these components step by step.\n\nFirst term: 6*(b × c) = 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term: -2*(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term: -3*(a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6]\n\nNow, add all these three vectors together:\n\nFirst, add the first and second terms:\n\n[6, -42, 108] + [-12, 14, -6] = (6 -12), (-42 +14), (108 -6) = [-6, -28, 102]\n\nThen add the third term:\n\n[-6, -28, 102] + [-12, -21, -6] = (-6 -12), (-28 -21), (102 -6) = [-18, -49, 96]\n\nSo the result of the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) should be [-18, -49, 96].\n\nWait, let me double-check the arithmetic to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: 6*1=6, 6*(-7)=-42, 6*18=108. Correct.\n\nSecond term: -2*6=-12, -2*(-7)=14, -2*3=-6. Correct.\n\nThird term: -3*4=-12, -3*7=-21, -3*2=-6.

So the final answer should be a vector with components (-18, -49, 96). Let me check if the problem expects the answer in a specific format, like boxed. The problem says to put the final answer in \\boxed{} format, so I should present it as \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more that I didn't mix up any signs.

Zaokrąglij swoją odpowiedź do najbliższej dziesiątej części centa.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the average cost per stamp for Juan's collection in the 1970s. Hmm, the problem mentions that the prices he paid for the stamps from a book store are: Brazil and France for 6 cents each, Peru for 4 cents each, and Spain for 5 cents each. The Asymptote code draws a sort of table, right? So the labels on the left are the countries, and the numbers below them are the number of stamps per decade for each country. The decades are 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. \n\nWait, let me look at the Asymptote code again to make sure I parse it correctly. The code seems to be drawing a grid with the decades on the left and the countries across the top. Each number in the cells represents the number of stamps for that country in that decade. Let me check each decade:\n\nFor the 50s: Brazil has 4, France has 8, Peru has 6, Spain has 3. \n\n60s: Brazil 7, France 4, Peru 4, Spain 9.\n\n70s: Brazil 12, France 12, Peru 6, Spain 13.\n\n80s: Brazil 8, France 15, Peru 10, Spain 9.\n\nSo, specifically for the 1970s, the number of stamps per country is: Brazil 12, France 12, Peru 6, Spain 13. \n\nNow, the average cost per stamp for 1970s would be the total cost divided by the total number of stamps. So first, I need to calculate the total cost for each country in the 1970s, then sum them all up, and divide by the total number of stamps.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, for Brazil in the 70s: 12 stamps, each costing 6 cents. So 12 * 6 = 72 cents.\n\nFrance in the 70s: 12 stamps, each 8 cents. 12 * 8 = 96 cents.\n\nPeru in the 70s: 6 stamps, each 4 cents. 6 * 4 = 24 cents.\n\nSpain in the 70s: 13 stamps, each 5 cents. 13 * 5 = 65 cents.\n\nNow, sum up all these amounts: 72 + 96 + 24 + 65.\n\nLet me compute that. 72 + 96 is 168. Then 168 + 24 is 192. Then 192 + 65 is 257 cents.\n\nTotal cost for 1970s stamps is 257 cents.\n\nTotal number of stamps in 1970s is 12 + 12 + 6 + 13.\n\nCalculating that: 12 + 12 = 24; 24 + 6 = 30; 30 + 13 = 43 stamps.\n\nSo the average cost per stamp is 257 cents divided by 43 stamps.\n\nLet me compute that division. 257 ÷ 43.\n\nFirst, 43 * 5 = 215. 257 - 215 = 42. So that's 5 with a remainder of 42.\n\n42 / 43 is approximately 0.9767...\n\nSo total average is approximately 5 + 0.9767 = 5.9767 cents per stamp.\n\nThe question says to round to the nearest tenth of a cent. So 5.9767 rounded to the nearest tenth. The hundredths place is 7, which is 5 or above, so we round up the tenths place from 9 to 10. But wait, 5.9767 is 5.9767, so the tenths place is 9, the hundredths is 7, so rounding to the nearest tenth would be 6.0.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. 257 divided by 43. Let me verify with actual division.\n\n43 into 257. 43*5=215, 257-215=42. So 5.9767... So, yes, 5.9767, so when rounding to the nearest tenth, the hundredths digit is 7, which is more than 5, so we round up the tenths digit. But the tenths digit is 9, so 9 + 0.1 = 10, which would make it 6.0. Therefore, the average cost per stamp is approximately 6.0 cents.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Zaokró uur infographicmakt кудż swoją ответsz do naj closerjей dziesiątej郯i centa.\" Which translates to \"Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a cent.\" So 5.9767... rounds to 6.0 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Because the next digit after the tenths place is 7, which is 5 or more, so we round up. So the answer is 6.0 cents.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Let me do 257 divided by 43. Let's compute this division step by step.\n\n43 | 257.0000\n\n43 goes into 257 six times? Wait, 43*6=258, which is more than 257. So 5 times. 43*5=215. Subtract 215 from 257, we get 42. Bring down a 0: 420. 43 goes into 420 nine times (43*9=387). Subtract 387 from 420: 33. Bring down a 0: 330. 43 goes into 330 seven times (43*7=301). Subtract 301: 29. Bring down a 0: 290. 43 goes into 290 six times (43*6=258). Subtract 258: 32. Bring down a 0: 320. 43 goes into 320 seven times (43*7=301). Subtract 301: 19. Bring down a 0: 190. 43 goes into 190 four times (43*4=172). Subtract 172: 18. Bring down a 0: 180. 43 goes into 180 four times (43*4=172). Subtract 172: 8. Bring down a 0: 80. 43 goes into 80 once (43*1=43). Subtract 43: 37. Bring down a 0: 370. 43 goes into 370 eight times (43*8=344). Subtract 344: 26. Bring down a 0: 260. 43 goes into 260 six times (43*6=258). Subtract 258: 2. So the division is 5.976744186... approximately.\n\nSo up to five decimal places: 5.97674... So when rounding to the nearest tenth, we look at the hundredths place, which is 7. Since 7 ≥ 5, we round the tenths place up from 9 to 10. But tenths place can't go beyond 10, so it becomes 0 and increments the units place. Wait, no. Wait, 5.97674 is 5 (units place), 9 (tenths), 7 (hundredths), 6 (thousandths), etc. So rounding to the nearest tenth: the tenths digit is 9, the next digit is 7. Since 7 ≥ 5, we add 1 to the tenths place: 9 + 1 = 10. But since the tenths place is a single digit, we carry over: 10 becomes 0, and the units place (5) increments by 1, making it 6. So 5.97674... ≈ 6.0 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Therefore, the average cost per stamp is 6.0 cents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6.0}\n</think>\n\nTo find the average cost per stamp for Juan's collection in the 1970s, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total number of stamps for each country in that decade.\n\nFor the 1970s:\n- **Brazil**: 12 stamps at 6 cents each: \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\) cents\n- **France**: 12 stamps at 8 cents each: \\(12 \\times 8 = 96\\) cents\n- **Peru**: 6 stamps at 4 cents each: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) cents\n- **Spain**: 13 stamps at 5 cents each: \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\) cents\n\nSumming these amounts gives the total cost:\n\\[\n72 + 96 + 24 + 65 = 257 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of stamps is:\n\\[\n12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ stamps}\n\\]\n\nThe average cost per stamp is then calculated by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:\n\\[\n\\frac{257}{43} \\approx 5.9767\n\\]\n\nRounding 5.9767 to the nearest tenth of a cent, we look at the hundredths place (7), which is 5 or greater, so we round up the tenths place from 9 to 10.

The problem states that AC is perpendicular to CD, AC bisects angle BAD, and the area of the trapezoid ABCD is 42. I need to find the area of triangle ACD.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, the bases are AD and BC. The legs are AB and CD. Now, AC is a diagonal that is perpendicular to CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. That means angle BAC is equal to angle CAD.\n\nLet me sketch this mentally. Point A is connected to C, and AC is perpendicular to CD. So triangle ACD is a right triangle at C. Wait, if AC is perpendicular to CD, then angle ACD is 90 degrees. So triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD, and hypotenuse AD. But AD is one of the bases of the trapezoid.\n\nSince AC bisects angle BAD, angle BAC equals angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAC as α, so angle CAD is also α. Therefore, angle BAD is 2α. Since AD is parallel to BC, the angles on the same side should sum to 180 degrees. So angle ABC is supplementary to angle BAD. Wait, no. In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So angle ABC and angle BCD are supplementary, and angle BAD and angle ADC are supplementary. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe I should assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and assuming AD is the lower base, then point A would be somewhere along the x-axis. Wait, but AC is perpendicular to CD. If D is at (0,0), and CD is a leg of the trapezoid, then C is somewhere along the line that is perpendicular to CD. Wait, CD is one of the legs, so CD is not necessarily vertical or horizontal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate system setup is the way to go here. Let me choose coordinates such that point D is at (0,0). Let me assume that CD is along the y-axis. Wait, but AC is perpendicular to CD. If CD is along the y-axis, then AC would have to be horizontal. But AC is a diagonal from A to C. If AC is horizontal and CD is vertical, then point C would be at (0, c) and point A would be at (a, 0). Then AC would be the line from (a,0) to (0,c), which has a slope of -c/a. For AC to be perpendicular to CD, which is vertical (since CD is from (0,0) to (0,c)), then AC must be horizontal. But a horizontal line from (a,0) to (0,c) would require c=0, which would collapse the trapezoid. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe CD is not vertical. Let me think again. Let me place point D at (0,0). Let me let CD be some line, and AC is perpendicular to CD. Let me assign coordinates such that CD is along the x-axis. Then AC would be vertical. But if CD is along the x-axis from D(0,0) to C(c,0), then AC is perpendicular to CD, so AC is vertical. Then point A would be (a, h) for some h, and point C is (c,0). Then AC is the line from (a,h) to (c,0), which has slope (0 - h)/(c - a) = -h/(c - a). For AC to be vertical, the slope would have to be undefined, which would require c - a = 0, so c = a. But then point C would be (a,0), same as point A's x-coordinate, but different y-coordinate. Then AC would be vertical, from (a,h) to (a,0). Then CD is from (0,0) to (a,0), which is horizontal. Then AD is from (0,0) to (a,h). Wait, but AD is supposed to be parallel to BC.\n\nWait, let's check. If in this coordinate system, AD is from (0,0) to (a,h), and BC is from (c,0) to B's coordinates. Wait, point B is connected to point C. If the trapezoid is ABCD with AD parallel to BC, then BC is the other base. So if AD is from (0,0) to (a,h), then BC should be parallel to that. But point C is at (a,0), so BC is from (a,0) to B. Wait, but then BC would have to be parallel to AD. The vector AD is (a, h), so BC should also have vector (a, h). But point B is connected to C(a,0), so if BC is parallel to AD, then B is at (a + a, 0 + h) = (2a, h). Wait, but then AB is from (0,0) to (2a, h), and CD is from (0,0) to (a,0). Hmm, but in this case, the legs are AB and CD, and the bases are AD and BC.\n\nBut in this setup, AC is from (a,h) to (a,0), which is vertical, and CD is from (0,0) to (a,0), which is horizontal. So AC is perpendicular to CD, as required. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. Let's check angle BAD. Point A is at (a,h), point B is at (2a, h), point D is at (0,0). So angle BAD is the angle at point A between BA and DA. Vector BA is from A to B: (2a - a, h - h) = (a, 0). Vector DA is from A to D: (0 - a, 0 - h) = (-a, -h). The angle between BA (a,0) and DA (-a,-h). The angle bisector is AC, which is the vertical line from A(a,h) to C(a,0). So does this vertical line bisect angle BAD?\n\nLet me compute the angles. The vector BA is (a,0), pointing to the right. The vector DA is (-a,-h), pointing down and to the left. The angle between BA and DA can be found using the dot product. The angle between BA (a,0) and DA (-a,-h) is given by:\n\ncosθ = (a*(-a) + 0*(-h)) / (|BA| |DA|) = (-a²) / (a * sqrt(a² + h²)) ) = -a / sqrt(a² + h²)\n\nSo θ = arccos(-a / sqrt(a² + h²))\n\nSince AC is supposed to bisect angle BAD, the angle between BA and AC should be equal to the angle between AC and DA.\n\nVector AC is from A(a,h) to C(a,0), which is (0, -h). So vector AC is (0, -h). The angle between BA (a,0) and AC (0,-h):\n\ncosφ = (a*0 + 0*(-h)) / (|BA| |AC|) = 0 / (a * h) = 0. So angle φ is 90 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, angle between AC (0,-h) and DA (-a,-h):\n\ncosψ = (0*(-a) + (-h)*(-h)) / (|AC| |DA|) = h² / (h * sqrt(a² + h²)) ) = h / sqrt(a² + h²)\n\nSo angle ψ = arccos(h / sqrt(a² + h²))\n\nFor AC to bisect angle BAD, angle φ should equal angle ψ. But angle φ is 90 degrees, so angle ψ must also be 90 degrees. Therefore:\n\narccos(h / sqrt(a² + h²)) = 90 degrees\n\nWhich implies:\n\nh / sqrt(a² + h²) = cos(90°) = 0\n\nBut h is the height of the trapezoid, so h cannot be zero. This is a contradiction. Therefore, my coordinate system assumption is flawed.\n\nHmm, so maybe placing D at (0,0) and CD along the x-axis isn't the right approach. Let me try a different coordinate system.\n\nLet me instead place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is a diagonal. Let me assume that AD is horizontal. So point D is at (d, 0). Then AC is perpendicular to CD. Let me denote point C as (c_x, c_y). Then AC is the vector from A(0,0) to C(c_x, c_y), and CD is the vector from C(c_x, c_y) to D(d, 0). For AC to be perpendicular to CD, their dot product must be zero:\n\n(c_x)(d - c_x) + (c_y)(0 - c_y) = 0\n\nSo c_x(d - c_x) - c_y² = 0\n\nAlso, AC bisects angle BAD. Since A is at (0,0), and AD is along the x-axis to D(d,0). So angle BAD is the angle at A between BA and DA. Since DA is along the positive x-axis, BA is some line from A(0,0) to B. The angle bisector is AC. So the direction of AC should be such that it bisects the angle between BA and the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote point B as (b_x, b_y). Since ABCD is a trapezoid with AD parallel to BC, BC must be parallel to AD, which is along the x-axis. Therefore, BC is also horizontal. So point B(b_x, b_y) and point C(c_x, c_y) must have the same y-coordinate. Therefore, b_y = c_y. Let's call this y-coordinate k. So point B is (b_x, k) and point C is (c_x, k).\n\nNow, AC is the line from A(0,0) to C(c_x, k). This line bisects angle BAD, which is the angle between BA and DA. DA is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to D(d,0). BA is from A(0,0) to B(b_x, k). The angle bisector theorem tells us that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.\n\nBut here, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD in triangle ABD. Wait, but ABCD is a trapezoid, so maybe triangle ABD isn't a triangle here. Wait, perhaps I need to consider triangle ABD. If I consider triangle ABD, with angle at A being BAD, and AC is the angle bisector, then according to the angle bisector theorem:\n\nAB / AD = BC / CD\n\nWait, but BC and CD are sides of the trapezoid. Wait, BC is parallel to AD, so BC is the other base. CD is a leg.\n\nWait, the angle bisector theorem in triangle ABD would state that if AC bisects angle BAD, then AB / AD = BC / CD. But in the trapezoid, BC is not part of triangle ABD. Hmm, maybe this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, since AC is the angle bisector, the direction vector of AC should satisfy the angle bisector condition between BA and DA. Let me compute the slopes.\n\nThe angle between BA and AC should equal the angle between AC and DA.\n\nThe vector BA is from A(0,0) to B(b_x, k): (b_x, k)\n\nThe vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(c_x, k): (c_x, k)\n\nThe vector DA is from A(0,0) to D(d,0): (d, 0)\n\nThe angle between BA and AC should equal the angle between AC and DA.\n\nUsing the formula for the angle between two vectors:\n\ncosθ1 = (BA · AC) / (|BA| |AC|)\n\ncosθ2 = (AC · DA) / (|AC| |DA|)\n\nSince θ1 = θ2, then:\n\n(BA · AC) / (|BA| |AC|) = (AC · DA) / (|AC| |DA|)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(BA · AC) / |BA| = (AC · DA) / |DA|\n\nCompute each dot product:\n\nBA · AC = (b_x)(c_x) + (k)(k) = b_x c_x + k²\n\nAC · DA = (c_x)(d) + (k)(0) = c_x d\n\nTherefore:\n\n(b_x c_x + k²) / |BA| = (c_x d) / |DA|\n\nCompute |BA| = sqrt(b_x² + k²)\n\n|DA| = sqrt(d² + 0) = d\n\nSo:\n\n(b_x c_x + k²) / sqrt(b_x² + k²) = (c_x d) / d = c_x\n\nTherefore:\n\n(b_x c_x + k²) / sqrt(b_x² + k²) = c_x\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(b_x² + k²):\n\nb_x c_x + k² = c_x sqrt(b_x² + k²)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(b_x c_x + k²)² = c_x² (b_x² + k²)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nb_x² c_x² + 2 b_x c_x k² + k^4 = c_x² b_x² + c_x² k²\n\nSubtract c_x² b_x² from both sides:\n\n2 b_x c_x k² + k^4 = c_x² k²\n\nDivide both sides by k² (assuming k ≠ 0, which it is since it's the height of the trapezoid):\n\n2 b_x c_x + k² = c_x²\n\nRearrange:\n\nc_x² - 2 b_x c_x - k² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of c_x:\n\nc_x² - 2 b_x c_x - k² = 0\n\nSolving for c_x:\n\nc_x = [2 b_x ± sqrt(4 b_x² + 4 k²)] / 2 = [2 b_x ± 2 sqrt(b_x² + k²)] / 2 = b_x ± sqrt(b_x² + k²)\n\nBut since c_x must be greater than b_x (assuming the trapezoid is oriented such that C is to the right of B), then:\n\nc_x = b_x + sqrt(b_x² + k²)\n\nBut this seems complicated.

Wyraź swoją odpowiedź w najprostszej formie ułamkowej.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to solve this equation. So, the problem is: if sqrt(2x) divided by sqrt(3x - 1) equals 3/2, find x. Alright, let's start by writing down the equation properly.\n\nFirst, the equation is:\n\n√(2x) / √(3x - 1) = 3/2\n\nHmm, okay. I need to solve for x here. Since there are square roots, maybe I can square both sides to get rid of them? Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I square both sides, the left side becomes (√(2x))² / (√(3x - 1))², which simplifies to (2x)/(3x - 1). The right side becomes (3/2)², which is 9/4. So now the equation is:\n\n2x / (3x - 1) = 9/4\n\nAlright, that looks better. Now, I can solve this equation by cross-multiplying. Multiply both sides by (3x - 1) and by 4 to eliminate the denominators. Let's do that step by step.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4*(3x - 1):\n\n4*(3x - 1)*(2x) = 9*(3x - 1)\n\nWait, actually, cross-multiplying would be:\n\n2x * 4 = 9 * (3x - 1)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 8x = 27x - 9\n\nNow, subtract 8x from both sides to get:\n\n0 = 19x - 9\n\nWait, that gives 19x - 9 = 0, so 19x = 9, so x = 9/19.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through it again.\n\nOriginal equation: √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nSquare both sides: (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.\n\nCross-multiplying: 4*2x = 9*(3x - 1).\n\nSo, 8x = 27x - 9.\n\nSubtract 8x: 0 = 19x - 9.\n\nAdd 9: 19x = 9.\n\nDivide by 19: x = 9/19.\n\nHmm, that seems right. But wait, I should check if this solution is valid in the original equation, because sometimes when you square both sides, you can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nSo, let's plug x = 9/19 back into the original equation and see if it works.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(2x):\n\n2x = 2*(9/19) = 18/19. So sqrt(18/19). Hmm.\n\nThen, sqrt(3x - 1):\n\n3x = 3*(9/19) = 27/19. So 3x - 1 = 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. So sqrt(8/19).\n\nSo the left side is sqrt(18/19)/sqrt(8/19). Let's compute that.\n\nsqrt(18/19) / sqrt(8/19) = sqrt(18/19 ÷ 8/19) = sqrt(18/8) = sqrt(9/4) = 3/2. Which is equal to the right side. So that works.\n\nTherefore, x = 9/19 is indeed the solution.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any restrictions on x in the original equation. The denominators inside the square roots must be positive. So, 3x - 1 > 0 => x > 1/3. Also, 2x must be non-negative, but since x > 1/3, 2x would be greater than 2*(1/3) = 2/3 > 0, so that's okay. So x must be greater than 1/3. Let's check if 9/19 is greater than 1/3. 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 9/19 is approximately 0.473, which is greater. So that's okay. Therefore, x = 9/19 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 9/19.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{19}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x - 1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nwe start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x - 1}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, we cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 2x = 9 \\cdot (3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\n8x = 27x - 9\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 8x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 19x - 9\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n19x = 9 \\implies x = \\frac{9}{19}\n\\]\n\nWe verify the solution by substituting \\( x = \\frac{9}{19} \\) back into the original equation.

I have this problem here about this operation @ defined as (m/n) @ (p/q) equals m times p times (q/n), right? And it's for simplified fractions p/q. So I need to find the value of (7/30) @ (10/21). Hmm, let me make sure I get the definition right. \n\nFirst, the operation takes two fractions, m/n and p/q, which are simplified. Then, according to the definition, when you perform @ on them, it's m multiplied by p multiplied by (q/n). So the formula is (m/n) @ (p/q) = m*p*(q/n). Let me check if that's correct. The original problem says (m/n) @ (p/q) = (m)(p)(q/n). Yeah, that's what it says. So the n is in the denominator here. So the result is m times p times q divided by n. \n\nNow, let's apply this to the given fractions: (7/30) @ (10/21). So here, m is 7, n is 30, p is 10, and q is 21. Let me confirm that these fractions are simplified. 7/30: 7 is a prime number, and 7 doesn't divide 30, so that's simplified. 10/21: 10 and 21 have a GCD of 1, since 10 factors into 2 and 5, and 21 factors into 3 and 7. So yes, both fractions are simplified. \n\nSo substituting into the formula: m*p*(q/n). Let's compute each part step by step. First, m is 7, p is 10, so m*p is 7*10 = 70. Then, q is 21, n is 30. So q/n is 21/30. Let me compute that. 21 divided by 30. Well, both are divisible by 3. 21 divided by 3 is 7, and 30 divided by 3 is 10. So 21/30 simplifies to 7/10. \n\nSo putting it all together: m*p*(q/n) is 70*(7/10). Let me compute that. 70 multiplied by 7 is 490, and then divided by 10. 490 divided by 10 is 49. So the result is 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. \n\nWait, 7/30 @ 10/21. So according to the formula, it's m*p*(q/n). So m is 7, p is 10, q is 21, n is 30. So 7*10*21/30. Let's compute that as fractions. 7*10 is 70, 70*21 is 1470, and then divided by 30. So 1470 divided by 30. Let's see, 30 goes into 1470 how many times? 30*40 is 1200, subtract 1200 from 1470, get 270. 30*9 is 270, so total is 40+9=49. So yes, 1470/30 is 49. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe simplifying before multiplying. Let's see: 7*10*21/30. Let's see if we can cancel factors first. 10 and 30 have a common factor of 10. So 10 divided by 10 is 1, and 30 divided by 10 is 3. So then the expression becomes 7*1*21/3. Then 21 divided by 3 is 7. So 7*7 is 49. That's the same result. \n\nSo either way, whether you compute it step by step or simplify first, you end up with 49. Therefore, the uproszczona (simplified) value is 49. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"uproszczona wartość\", which is the simplified value. Since 49 is an integer, it's already simplified. So yes, 49 is the answer. \n\nLet me just verify once more to be sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nOriginal operation: (7/30) @ (10/21) = 7*10*21/30. \n\n7*10 is 70, 70*21 is 1470. 1470 divided by 30 is 49. \n\nAlternatively, 7/30 * 10/21. Wait, no, the operation @ is not regular multiplication. The operation @ is defined as m*p*q/n. So it's not (7/30)*(10/21), which would be (7*10)/(30*21). But here, it's m*p*(q/n). So 7*10*(21/30). Which is 7*10*(7/10) as 21/30 simplifies to 7/10. Then 7*10*(7/10) is 7*(10*(7/10)) is 7*7 is 49. Yep, that works. \n\nSo I think 49 is the correct answer. Let me check if there's any possible mistake in the definition. The problem says \"uproszczonych ułamков\", which translates to \"simplified fractions\". So both inputs are simplified, which they are. So there's no issue there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The operation @ is (m/n) @ (p/q) = m*p*(q/n). So it's m times p times q divided by n. So m is numerator of first fraction, n is denominator of first fraction, p is numerator of second fraction, q is denominator of second fraction. So yes, that seems correct. \n\nSo substituting the numbers, 7*10*21/30. 7*10 is 70, 70*21 is 1470, divided by 30 is 49. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 49, which in boxed form is \\boxed{49}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n</think>\n\nThe operation \\( @ \\) is defined as \\(\\frac{m}{n} @ \\frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\\left(\\frac{q}{n}\\right)\\) for simplified fractions \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\).

We need to find the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have two chords on a circle, they intersect if and only if the four endpoints are arranged alternately around the circle. So, like, if you go around the circle, you encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D or some rotation of that, right? Because if they're interleaved, the chords cross each other. If they're all on the same side, like A, B, C, D, then the chords don't intersect. So maybe the key is figuring out how many such alternating arrangements there are compared to all possible arrangements.\n\nBut wait, the points are chosen independently and randomly. So maybe it's about the order in which they appear around the circle. Since the points are selected independently, each permutation of the four points is equally likely. But wait, on a circle, the starting point doesn't matter, so we can fix one point and consider the order of the other three. Hmm, so maybe the problem reduces to fixing point A and then looking at the positions of B, C, D relative to A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of all possible ways four distinct points can be placed on the circle and then determine the probability that AB and CD intersect. Since the circle is continuous, the exact positions don't matter, just their cyclic order. So perhaps we can consider the four points as being randomly ordered around the circle.\n\nLet me recall that for four distinct points on a circle, the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3. Wait, is that right? Or is it something else? Maybe I need to work it out.\n\nLet me consider that once the four points are placed on the circle, the chords AB and CD will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order: A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C or any rotation of that. So there are two distinct cyclic orders where the chords intersect. Since the circle has rotational symmetry, each of these arrangements is equally likely.\n\nBut how many possible orderings are there? For four distinct points on a circle, the number of distinct cyclic permutations is (4-1)! = 6. Wait, no. Wait, when considering cyclic permutations, the number of distinct arrangements is considered the same if they can be rotated into each other. But actually, when arranging points around a circle, the number of distinct orderings is (n-1)! So for four points, it's 3! = 6. But in this case, since the points are labeled A, B, C, D, each permutation is unique even if it's a rotation. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the labels are fixed. So actually, the number of possible orderings is 4! = 24. But since the circle can be rotated, maybe some of these orderings are equivalent. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability is calculated by fixing one point, say A, and then considering the positions of B, C, D relative to A. Since the circle is continuous, we can fix A at some position and then randomly place B, C, D around the circumference. The key is the relative order of B, C, D.\n\nBut since the circle is rotationally symmetric, fixing A doesn't affect the generality. So let's fix A at 0 degrees. Then we can represent the positions of B, C, D as angles between 0 and 360 degrees, but since their order matters, we can think of them as being randomly ordered. The key is that once A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are three random points on the circle. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if C and D are on opposite sides of the chord AB.\n\nWait, that's a good way to think about it. If I have chord AB, then CD intersects AB if and only if one endpoint of CD is on one side of AB and the other endpoint is on the other side. So the chord CD spans across AB. So how can we calculate the probability of that?\n\nAlternatively, once AB is fixed, the chord CD will intersect AB if and only if C and D are on different arcs defined by AB. Since AB divides the circle into two arcs. If C and D are on different arcs, then CD crosses AB. If they are on the same arc, then CD doesn't cross AB.\n\nSo the probability that CD intersects AB is equal to the probability that, given AB is fixed, C and D are on different arcs. Since AB divides the circle into two arcs, the length of each arc can vary. Wait, but since the points are chosen randomly, the positions of C and D are independent and uniform over the circle. But AB is fixed once we fix A.\n\nWait, but AB is not fixed in length, since A and B are chosen randomly. Wait, actually, AB is a random chord. But if we fix A first, then B is random, but since the circle is rotationally symmetric, fixing A doesn't affect the generality. So perhaps we can fix A and let B, C, D be random points on the circle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the four points in random order. The probability that the four points are arranged such that when you connect AB and CD, they cross. So the problem reduces to the probability that, among four random points on a circle, the two chords AB and CD intersect.\n\nI remember that for four random points on a circle, the probability that the two chords intersect is 1/3. But I need to verify that.\n\nLet me think combinatorially. Suppose we have four distinct points on a circle. There are 4! = 24 possible orderings. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, the number of distinct orderings is actually 4! / 4 = 6. But actually, if we fix one point, say A, then the order of the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So the number of distinct arrangements is 6.\n\nBut in reality, when considering the circle, the order is cyclic. So the number of distinct cyclic orderings is (4-1)! = 6. So each cyclic permutation is equally likely. Therefore, the probability that the chords intersect is the number of cyclic permutations where AB and CD intersect divided by 6.\n\nSo how many of these cyclic permutations result in intersecting chords?\n\nFor four points labeled A, B, C, D, the chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the points are arranged in the order A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C when moving around the circle. These are two specific cyclic orders. Therefore, the number of favorable cyclic permutations is 2 out of 6, so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this reasoning. If we fix A, then the order of B, C, D can be any of 6 permutations. For each permutation, we can check if AB and CD intersect.\n\nBut actually, when we fix A, the positions of B, C, D are three random points. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if C and D are on opposite arcs determined by AB. Wait, but AB is a chord, so it splits the circle into two arcs. The probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to the probability that one is on one arc and the other is on the other arc.\n\nBut since C and D are placed randomly, the probability that they are on different arcs is equal to the probability that one is on the left arc and the other on the right arc. If AB is fixed, then the length of the arcs can vary. Wait, no. Wait, actually, AB is not fixed. AB is a random chord. So AB's length is also random. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach with cyclic permutations is oversimplified. Because when the chords are random, the arcs between points are random. So fixing A and considering the order of B, C, D might not capture the randomness of AB's position.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: fix the circle and randomly place four points on it. The probability that chords AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, when moving around the circle, the points appear in an order where A and B are adjacent in some sense, but CD are interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, since all four points are randomly ordered around the circle, the probability that AB and CD intersect is the same as the probability that, among the four points, the two chords cross each other. For two chords to cross, the four points must be arranged in an alternating order: A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C, etc., around the circle.\n\nSince the four points are randomly ordered, the number of ways to arrange them is 4! = 24. However, since the circle has rotational symmetry, we can fix one point, say A, and consider the permutations of the other three points. Fixing A, the remaining three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. For AB and CD to intersect, C and D must be placed on opposite sides of AB. But AB is a chord; splitting the circle into two arcs. The probability that C and D are on opposite arcs depends on the position of AB.\n\nWait, but AB is not fixed. So maybe this approach isn't correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to note that for any four distinct points on a circle, the two chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. There are two such arrangements for each set of four points: A, C, B, D and A, D, B, C, and their rotations. Since there are 4! = 24 total permutations, but considering rotational symmetry, there are (4-1)! = 6 distinct cyclic permutations. Out of these, how many result in intersecting chords?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of ways to arrange the four points such that AB and CD intersect. Let's fix the order of the four points around the circle. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the points are arranged in the order A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C, and their rotations. Each of these is a distinct cyclic order. So for each set of four points, there are two cyclic orders where the chords intersect. Therefore, the number of favorable cyclic orders is 2 out of 6, so probability 1/3.\n\nBut does this hold when the points are not fixed? Because in reality, the points are placed randomly, so the cyclic order is random. Therefore, the probability that the four points are arranged in one of the two intersecting orders is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Let's consider the four points A, B, C, D on the circle. Let's fix point A somewhere. Then the positions of B, C, D are random. The chord AB is determined by where B is placed. Then, for CD to intersect AB, points C and D must lie on opposite arcs determined by AB.\n\nThe probability that C and D lie on opposite arcs is equal to the probability that one is on one side of AB and the other is on the other side. Since AB is a random chord, the length of the arcs is random. Wait, but AB is also a random chord. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but maybe we can fix AB first. Let's fix point A, then point B is random. Then, given AB, the circle is divided into two arcs. The probability that points C and D lie on opposite arcs is equal to the probability that one is on one arc and the other is on the other arc. Since C and D are placed independently and uniformly, the probability that C is on one arc and D is on the other is 2 * (length of arc1 / circumference) * (length of arc2 / circumference). But since AB is random, the expected value of this probability would be 2 * E[arc1 * arc2 / (circumference^2)].\n\nBut arc1 and arc2 are segments of the circle divided by AB. Since AB is a random chord, the expected value of arc1 * arc2 is equal to the expected value of (L)(1 - L), where L is the length of arc1. Since AB is a random chord, the distribution of L is such that E[L] = 1/2, and E[L^2] = 1/3. Therefore, E[L(1 - L)] = E[L] - E[L^2] = 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6. Therefore, the expected probability is 2 * (1/6) = 1/3. Therefore, the probability that CD intersects AB is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that seems to confirm the earlier result. So both approaches give 1/3. Therefore, the answer should be 1/3.\n\nBut let me check with another method. Suppose we fix the circle and randomly select four points on it. The probability that chords AB and CD intersect can be calculated by considering the relative positions of all four points.\n\nSince the points are independent, the probability should only depend on their cyclic order. There are 4! = 24 possible orderings, but considering rotational symmetry, we can fix A and arrange B, C, D in 6 ways. For each of these 6 orderings, we can check if AB and CD intersect.\n\nBut as before, the chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order. For example, if the order is A, C, B, D, then AB and CD cross. Similarly, A, D, B, C also results in crossing. Each of these corresponds to two cyclic orders. Therefore, out of 6 possible cyclic orders, 2 result in intersection, so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the probability is 1/3. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the chords \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability that the chords \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect when four points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we need to consider the cyclic order of these points.\n\n1. **Key Insight**: Two chords \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. This means the points must be ordered such as \\(A, C, B, D\\) or \\(A, D, B, C\\) (and their rotations).\n\n2. **Cyclic Permutations**: For four distinct points on a circle, there are \\(4!\\) permutations, but considering rotational symmetry, we fix one point (say \\(A\\)) and consider the permutations of the remaining three points \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). This results in \\(3! = 6\\) distinct cyclic permutations.\n\n3.", "answer": "\\frac{1}{3}"}

So we have two circles, both with center at point D. The radii are 1 and 2. The shaded area's total integral surface is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. We need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the diagram. There's a smaller circle with radius 1 and a larger circle with radius 2, both centered at D. There's a shaded region, which is probably the area between the two circles, but maybe also some segments? The Asymptote code shows that the shaded area is a sort of lens-shaped region formed by two arcs. The labels are A, C, and D, with A and C on the larger circle, I think. The angle ADC is the angle at D between points A and C.\n\nSince the problem mentions the ratio of the shaded area to the larger circle's area is 5/12, let me note that the area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. So the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. \n\nNow, the shaded area is likely the region between the two circles, but only a part of it determined by the angle ADC. If I consider the two circles, the area between them would be an annular region, but since there's a specific angle involved, maybe it's a sector of the annulus? Or perhaps it's two segments, one from each circle?\n\nWait, the Asymptote code mentions paths region1 and region2. Looking at the code:\n\npath inner = arc(d, a/2, c/2, CW);  \npath outer = arc(d, c, a, CCW);  \n guide region1 = (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;  \n guide region2 = arc(d, a/2, c/2, CCW)..(c/2--d--a/2)..cycle;  \n\nHmm, maybe region1 is the shaded area formed by the outer arc (radius 2) and inner arc (radius 1), connected by lines from A to A/2 (midpoint?) and from C/2 to C. Region2 is another shaded area which is an arc from a/2 to c/2 (midpoints) connected by lines to D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area inside the larger circle but outside the smaller one, but only between points A and C. So it's like a sector of the annulus with angle equal to ADC. If that's the case, the area would be (θ/2π)*(π*(2^2 - 1^2)) = (θ/2π)*(3π) = (3θ)/2. But the problem states that the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is 5/12 * 4π = 5π/3. So if the shaded area is (3θ)/2, then (3θ)/2 = 5π/3, which would give θ = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9, which is approximately 200 degrees. But 10π/9 radians is 200 degrees. However, the problem mentions the smaller angle ADC. Wait, angles can be more than 180 degrees, but maybe they mean the smaller angle, so if the angle is more than 180, we take the reflex angle? But the Asymptote code uses CCW and CW, so maybe the angle is given as the smaller one. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that the shaded area is the intersection of two sectors: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. The area would then be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle, plus the area of the triangle if necessary. Wait, maybe it's the union or the difference?\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, region1 is (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle. So starting from point A, going halfway to D (a/2), then following the inner arc (radius 1) to c/2, then following the outer arc (radius 2) to C, then back to A. Hmm, this seems like a kind of lens shape. Similarly, region2 is arc from a/2 to c/2 connected by lines to D. Maybe region1 is the shaded area between the two arcs and the lines, and region2 is another shaded area which is a triangle or something else. But the problem says the entire integral surface of the zacienirownegobszara (the shaded area) is 5/12 of the larger circle. So we need to compute the area of the shaded region and set it equal to 5/12 of the larger circle's area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area inside both circles? No, since the circles are concentric, the area inside both would just be the smaller circle. But the problem states that the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is more than the area of the smaller circle (which is π*1^2 = π, and 5/12 of 4π is 5π/3 ≈ 5.23, which is less than π*2^2=4π, wait, no. Wait, 5/12 of the larger circle's area is 5/12 * 4π = 5π/3 ≈ 5.23. The smaller circle's area is π ≈ 3.14, so 5π/3 is bigger. Therefore, the shaded area must be the area between the two circles in some sector, not the entire annulus. So the shaded area is the part of the annulus with angle θ, so area would be (θ/2π)*(π*(2^2 -1^2)) = (θ/2π)*(3π) = (3θ)/2. Then setting that equal to 5π/3, we get 3θ/2 = 5π/3 ⇒ θ = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9 ≈ 200 degrees. But the problem mentions the smaller angle ADC. If θ is 10π/9, which is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees? But 160 degrees is less than 180. Wait, but angles in circles can be measured in either way. However, in geometry, the smaller angle between two points is usually considered the smaller one, so if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would be 160 degrees. But the problem might just be asking for the measure of angle ADC, which could be the actual angle, regardless of being major or minor. Wait, the problem says \"m composiety miarа krogu (mniejszy) kąta ADC\". Maybe the translation is \"measure (smaller) of the angle ADC\". So maybe they want the smaller angle between the two radii DA and DC. So if the angle we found is 10π/9, which is 200 degrees, that's the larger angle, so the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. But 160 degrees is still bigger than 180? Wait, no, 160 is less than 180. Wait, 160 degrees is the smaller angle. So maybe the answer is 160 degrees? But let's check.\n\nWait, no. If the central angle is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But how is the angle measured? If points A and C are on the larger circle (radius 2), then the angle ADC is the central angle at D between points A and C. If the arc from A to C is 200 degrees, then the reflex angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 160 degrees. But we need to confirm.\n\nBut let's verify the area calculation again. If the shaded area is the sector area between the two circles with angle θ, then the area would be (θ/2π)(π*(2² -1²)) = (θ/2π)(3π) = (3θ)/2. If this is equal to 5π/3, then solving for θ:\n\n3θ/2 = 5π/3  \nθ = (5π/3)*(2/3) = 10π/9 radians  \nConvert to degrees: 10π/9 * (180/π) = 200 degrees.\n\nSo the angle is 200 degrees, but since angles are typically measured as the smaller one unless specified, but the problem says \"mallerii kąta\", which is \"smaller angle\". So 200 degrees is a reflex angle, so the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 160 degrees. But let's check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is something else. Let's think again. The Asymptote code draws an outer arc from A to C (radius 2), an inner arc from c/2 to a/2 (radius 1), connected by lines. The shaded area region1 is a closed path: from A to A/2 (midpoint), then along the inner arc to C/2, then along the outer arc back to C. So this seems like a sort of circular segment between the two circles. Similarly, region2 is an arc from a/2 to c/2 connected by lines to D. Maybe region2 is another segment? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is the union of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. But given that the ratio is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 5π/3, perhaps it's the area between the two arcs and the lines. Let's try to compute that area.\n\nIf the shaded region is the area bounded by the two arcs (from radius 1 and 2) and the lines from A to A/2 and from C/2 to C, then this area would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the sector of the smaller circle minus the triangle parts. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose angle ADC is θ radians. Then, the sector area of the larger circle (radius 2) would be (1/2)*2²*θ = 2θ. The sector area of the smaller circle (radius 1) would be (1/2)*1²*θ = 0.5θ. The area between the two sectors is 2θ - 0.5θ = 1.5θ. But the shaded region might also include some triangle areas. Looking at the Asymptote code, region1 is (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle. So from point A, it goes to the midpoint (a/2), then follows the inner arc to midpoint (c/2), then follows the outer arc back to C, then back to A. So this seems like a sector of the outer circle minus a sector of the inner circle, but connected by lines from A to a/2 and from c/2 to C. Hmm, maybe the shaded area is the area of the outer sector minus the inner sector minus the two triangles. Wait, no, because the path goes from A to a/2, then along the inner arc to c/2, then along the outer arc back to C, then back to A. So the area would be the area bounded by those four segments: A to a/2, inner arc a/2 to c/2, outer arc c/2 to A. Wait, no, because from c/2 back to A, that's a line? Wait, the Asymptote code says:\n\n guide region1 = (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;  \n\nSo starting at A, drawing a line to a/2, then following the inner arc from a/2 to c/2, then following the outer arc from c/2 back to A. Wait, but c/2 is on the inner circle? Wait, the inner circle has radius 1, and the outer circle has radius 2. If D is the center, then a is on the outer circle (radius 2), c is also on the outer circle. The inner arc would be from a/2 to c/2, which are midpoints? So the inner arc is radius 1, centered at D. So if a/2 is the midpoint between D and A, then a/2 is at distance 1 from D, same as c/2. Then the inner arc is from a/2 to c/2 along the inner circle, then the outer arc is from c/2 back to A along the outer circle. So the shaded region is a sort of quadrilateral shape with two arcs and two lines. \n\nSo this area would be the area of the outer sector (A to c/2 to A) minus the area of the inner sector (a/2 to c/2 to a/2). Wait, but the outer sector is from A to c/2 along the outer circle, but c/2 is a different point. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the outer arc is from c/2 to A, then that's along the outer circle. The inner arc is from a/2 to c/2 along the inner circle. The lines are from A to a/2 and from c/2 to C. Wait, maybe point C is another point on the outer circle? Wait, in the Asymptote code, point c is defined as (2, 0), which is on the outer circle (radius 2). Similarly, point a is defined as 2 * dir(100), which is a point on the outer circle at angle 100 degrees. So points A and C are on the outer circle, D is the center. The inner circle has radius 1, so a/2 is halfway from D to A, and c/2 is halfway from D to C. \n\nTherefore, the shaded region region1 is the area bounded by:\n\n1. Line from A to a/2 (midpoint of DA)\n2. Inner arc from a/2 to c/2 (midpoints of DA and DC)\n3. Outer arc from c/2 to A\n4. Line from C back to C? Wait, no, the code says:\n\n guide region1 = (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;  \n\nSo starting at A, go to a/2 (line", "answer": "120"}

Ile takich zlewek wody potrzeba, aby napełnić kulisty zbiornik o promieniu 6 cm?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a cylindrical basin with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm. We need to determine how many such cylindrical barrels are required to fill a spherical water tank with a radius of 6 cm. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas for the volumes of a cylinder and a sphere. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. For the sphere, the volume is (4/3)πr³. Right?\n\nSo, let's compute the volume of one cylindrical barrel. The radius here is 3 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging those into the cylinder volume formula: V_cylinder = π*(3)²*8. Let me calculate that. 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 8 is 72. So, V_cylinder = 72π cubic centimeters. Got that.\n\nNext, the spherical tank. The radius is 6 cm. Using the sphere volume formula: V_sphere = (4/3)π*(6)³. Let's compute that. 6 cubed is 216. Multiply that by 4/3: (4/3)*216. Let me see, 216 divided by 3 is 72, and 72 multiplied by 4 is 288. So, V_sphere = 288π cubic centimeters. Alright.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill the spherical tank. That would be the volume of the sphere divided by the volume of one cylinder, right? So, number of barrels = V_sphere / V_cylinder.\n\nPlugging in the values: 288π / 72π. The π terms cancel out, so we have 288 / 72. Dividing those numbers: 288 divided by 72 is 4. So, the answer should be 4. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, cylinder volume: 3 squared is 9, 9*8=72. Yes, 72π. Sphere volume: 6 cubed is 216, 216*(4/3)=288. Yes, 288π. Dividing 288π by 72π gives 4. Yep, that checks out. So, 4 barrels are needed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that the height of the cylinder matters more? For example, sometimes when you have a cylinder, especially in practical problems, you have to consider if the cylinder is filled to the brim or if there's something else. But in the problem statement, it says \"napeŀnić zbiornik,\" which translates to \"fill the water tank.\" Since both the cylinder and the sphere are containers, and the problem doesn't mention anything about the dimensions of the tank other than its radius, I think we can safely assume that the entire volume of the sphere is being filled by the cylindrical barrels. So, volume-wise, it's a straightforward division.\n\nAnother thing to check: units. All measurements are in centimeters, so the volumes are in cubic centimeters. The answer will be a pure number, which makes sense here. No unit conversion issues to worry about.\n\nLet me visualize this. A sphere with radius 6 cm—so diameter 12 cm. The cylindrical barrels are 3 cm radius and 8 cm height. The sphere's volume is larger, so we need to see how many of these small cylinders can add up to the sphere's volume. Since the sphere is symmetrical and the cylinder is a standard shape, the calculation is straightforward.\n\nIs there any trick here that I'm missing? Sometimes problems might involve packing efficiency, like how much of the cylindrical volume is actually filled into the spherical tank, but in this case, the problem states \"nape Lak\" which is \"fill the water tank.\" So, I think it's just a volume comparison. The answer is 4. \n\nJust to confirm with approximate values. Let's compute the numerical values. π is approximately 3.1416. So, cylinder volume is 72*3.1416 ≈ 226.1952 cm³. Sphere volume is 288*3.1416 ≈ 904.7784 cm³. Dividing 904.7784 by 226.1952 gives approximately 4. So, that matches. Therefore, the answer is indeed 4.\n\nI think that's solid. The key steps were recalling the volume formulas, plugging in the given dimensions, and performing the division. The result is 4, which seems reasonable. There's no mention of any other constraints, so this should be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill a spherical water tank, we start by calculating the volumes of both the cylinder and the sphere.\n\n1. **Volume of the cylindrical barrel**:\n   - Radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm\n   - Height \\( h = 8 \\) cm\n   - Volume formula: \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h \\)\n   - Calculation: \n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic centimeters}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the spherical tank**:\n   - Radius \\( R = 6 \\) cm\n   - Volume formula: \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\)\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 216 = 288\\pi \\text{ cubic centimeters}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Number of cylindrical barrels needed**:\n   - Divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylinder:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of barrels} = \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cylinder}}} = \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = \\frac{288}{72} = 4\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of cylindrical barrels needed to fill the spherical tank is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).", "answer": "4"}

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that arcsin is the inverse function of sine, so if I have arcsin x, that gives me an angle whose sine is x. So, arcsin 0.4 is an angle θ where sin θ = 0.4, and similarly, arcsin 0.5 is another angle φ where sin φ = 0.5. The problem is asking for sin(θ + φ) multiplied by sin(φ - θ). \n\nWait, maybe I can use trigonometric identities here. The sine of a sum and the sine of a difference. Let me recall the formulas:\n\nsin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n\nsin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B\n\nSo, if I expand both sin(θ + φ) and sin(φ - θ), then multiply them together, perhaps some terms will cancel out or simplify. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's compute sin(θ + φ):\n\nsin(θ + φ) = sin θ cos φ + cos θ sin φ\n\nSimilarly, sin(φ - θ) = sin φ cos θ - cos φ sin θ\n\nSo, multiplying these two expressions:\n\n[sin θ cos φ + cos θ sin φ][sin φ cos θ - cos φ sin θ]\n\nLet me expand this product. Let's do the distributive property:\n\nFirst term: sin θ cos φ * sin φ cos θ\n\nSecond term: sin θ cos φ * (-cos φ sin θ)\n\nThird term: cos θ sin φ * sin φ cos θ\n\nFourth term: cos θ sin φ * (-cos φ sin θ)\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n1. sin θ cos φ * sin φ cos θ = sin θ cos θ sin φ cos φ\n\n2. sin θ cos φ * (-cos φ sin θ) = -sin²θ cos²φ\n\n3. cos θ sin φ * sin φ cos θ = cos²θ sin²φ\n\n4. cos θ sin φ * (-cos φ sin θ) = -cos θ cos φ sin θ sin φ\n\nNow, combining all these terms:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4\n\n= sin θ cos θ sin φ cos φ - sin²θ cos²φ + cos²θ sin²φ - cos θ cos φ sin θ sin φ\n\nHmm, let's see. Notice that Term1 and Term4 are similar but have opposite signs. Wait, Term1 is positive and Term4 is negative. Let me check:\n\nTerm1: sin θ cos θ sin φ cos φ\n\nTerm4: -cos θ cos φ sin θ sin φ = -sin θ sin φ cos θ cos φ\n\nSo, Term1 and Term4 are actually the same, except Term1 is positive and Term4 is negative. Therefore, they cancel each other out. So Term1 + Term4 = 0.\n\nThat leaves us with Term2 + Term3:\n\nTerm2: -sin²θ cos²φ\n\nTerm3: cos²θ sin²φ\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n-sin²θ cos²φ + cos²θ sin²φ\n\nHmm, that can be written as:\n\ncos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ\n\nWhich is similar to a difference of squares. Let me factor this expression. Let's see:\n\ncos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ = (cosθ sinφ - sinθ cosφ)(cosθ sinφ + sinθ cosφ)\n\nWait, but that's going back to the original terms. Alternatively, perhaps factor out common terms.\n\nAlternatively, factor out sin²φ cos²θ terms? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, factor out cos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ = (cosθ sinφ - sinθ cosφ)(cosθ sinφ + sinθ cosφ)\n\nBut that's going to be (sin(φ - θ))(sin(φ + θ)), since sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B and sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. Wait, but in our case, we have:\n\ncosθ sinφ - sinθ cosφ = sin(φ - θ)\n\nand\n\ncosθ sinφ + sinθ cosφ = sin(φ + θ)\n\nBut in our expression, we have cos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ, which is (cosθ sinφ - sinθ cosφ)(cosθ sinφ + sinθ cosφ) = sin(φ - θ) * sin(φ + θ)\n\nBut the original expression was sin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ), which is exactly sin(φ + θ) * sin(φ - θ). So, our expression simplifies to sin(φ + θ) * sin(φ - θ). Wait, but that's the original product. So, that approach just brings us back to the original expression. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but we have already simplified the product to cos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ. Let's see if we can write that differently.\n\nAlternatively, factor out cos²θ and sin²φ:\n\ncos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ = cos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ = (cosθ sinφ)^2 - (sinθ cosφ)^2\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: (cosθ sinφ - sinθ cosφ)(cosθ sinφ + sinθ cosφ) = sin(φ - θ) * sin(φ + θ). So, again, same result.\n\nHmm, so maybe we need another approach. Let's recall that θ = arcsin 0.4 and φ = arcsin 0.5. So, perhaps we can find the values of cosθ and cosφ using Pythagorean identity.\n\nSince θ = arcsin 0.4, then sinθ = 0.4, so cosθ = sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84). Similarly, φ = arcsin 0.5, so sinφ = 0.5, so cosφ = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75).\n\nSo, cosθ = sqrt(0.84) and cosφ = sqrt(0.75). Let me compute these values numerically to see if that helps.\n\nBut perhaps we can keep them as exact expressions. sqrt(0.84) is sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5? Wait, 0.84 is 84/100 = 21/25. So sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 0.9165. Similarly, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.\n\nBut maybe we can write them in terms of radicals. Let's see:\n\nsqrt(0.84) = sqrt(21/25) = (sqrt(21))/5\n\nsqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3))/2\n\nSo, cosθ = sqrt(21)/5 and cosφ = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, now, going back to our expression:\n\ncos²θ sin²φ - sin²θ cos²φ\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nFirst, cos²θ = (sqrt(21)/5)^2 = 21/25\n\nsin²φ = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nSo, cos²θ sin²φ = (21/25)(0.25) = (21/25)(1/4) = 21/100\n\nNext, sin²θ = (0.4)^2 = 0.16\n\ncos²φ = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4\n\nSo, sin²θ cos²φ = (0.16)(3/4) = (4/25)(3/4) = 12/100\n\nTherefore, our expression becomes:\n\n21/100 - 12/100 = 9/100\n\nSo, the value of the original expression is 9/100, which is 0.09. Therefore, the answer is 9/100.\n\nWait, let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, cosθ = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84). Correct. Then, cos²θ = 0.84. But 0.84 is 21/25, so cos²θ = 21/25. Then, sin²φ = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So, cos²θ sin²φ = (21/25)(1/4) = 21/100. That's correct.\n\nThen, sin²θ = (0.4)^2 = 0.16. cos²φ = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So, sin²θ cos²φ = 0.16 * 0.75 = 0.12. Which is 12/100. Then, 21/100 - 12/100 = 9/100. So, yes, that's 0.09. So, the answer is 9/100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since θ and φ are arcsin 0.4 and arcsin 0.5, perhaps we can think of θ and φ as angles in a right triangle. For θ, sinθ = 0.4, so if we imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 0.4 and the hypotenuse is 1, then the adjacent side is sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84). Similarly for φ, sinφ = 0.5, so the opposite side is 0.5, hypotenuse 1, adjacent side sqrt(0.75). So, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using complex numbers or another identity, but I think the approach I took is valid.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute sin(θ + φ) and sin(φ - θ) separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, compute sin(θ + φ):\n\nsinθ = 0.4, cosθ = sqrt(0.84)\n\nsinφ = 0.5, cosφ = sqrt(0.75)\n\nSo, sin(θ + φ) = sinθ cosφ + cosθ sinφ = 0.4 * sqrt(0.75) + sqrt(0.84) * 0.5\n\nSimilarly, sin(φ - θ) = sinφ cosθ - cosφ sinθ = 0.5 * sqrt(0.84) - sqrt(0.75) * 0.4\n\nThen, multiplying these two expressions. But this seems more complicated. Let's see if it gives the same result.\n\nCompute sin(θ + φ):\n\nFirst term: 0.4 * sqrt(0.75) = 0.4 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.4 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.3464\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.84) * 0.5 = (sqrt(21)/5) * 0.5 = (sqrt(21)/10) ≈ 0.9165 / 10 ≈ 0.09165 * 5? Wait, sqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837, so sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 0.9165. Multiply by 0.5 gives ≈ 0.45825\n\nSo, sin(θ + φ) ≈ 0.3464 + 0.45825 ≈ 0.80465\n\nSimilarly, sin(φ - θ):\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * sqrt(0.84) = 0.5 * 0.9165 ≈ 0.45825\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.75) * 0.4 = (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.4 ≈ 0.8660 * 0.4 ≈ 0.3464\n\nTherefore, sin(φ - θ) ≈ 0.45825 - 0.3464 ≈ 0.11185\n\nThen, multiplying sin(θ + φ) * sin(φ - θ) ≈ 0.80465 * 0.11185 ≈ 0.0900, which is approximately 0.09, which is 9/100. So that matches the previous result. Therefore, this confirms that the answer is indeed 9/100.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 9/100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(\\sin (\\arcsin 0.4 + \\arcsin 0.5) \\cdot \\sin (\\arcsin 0.5 - \\arcsin 0.4)\\), we start by letting \\(\\theta = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\phi = \\arcsin 0.5\\).

Jaka jest prędkość roweru wyrażona w calach na sekundę?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the rowing speed from staces per minute to fathoms per second. Hmm, first, I should make sure I know the units involved here. A stace is a unit of distance, right? And a fathom is also a unit of distance, but longer. Wait, how do these units relate to each other? Let me recall. I think 1 fathom is equal to 6 feet, and 1 stace is 1 meter. Wait, is that right? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nActually, in water measurement, a fathom is 6 feet, which is equivalent to 1.8288 meters. And a stace is a unit used in rowing, I believe it's also a foot. Wait, maybe I need to confirm the exact conversion factor between staces and fathoms. If 1 fathom is 6 feet and 1 stace is 1 foot, then 1 fathom is 6 staces. But wait, hold on, maybe in the context of rowing, the stace is a different unit? No, probably not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some European countries, the stace is a foot. So 1 stace = 0.3048 meters (since 1 foot is 0.3048 meters). And a fathom is 1.8288 meters (6 feet). So to convert from staces to fathoms, since 1 fathom is 6 staces, then 1 stace = 1/6 fathoms. Therefore, if the rower's speed is 20 staces per minute, that would be 20/6 fathoms per minute, which simplifies to 10/3 or approximately 3.333 fathoms per minute. Then, we need to convert that to fathoms per second by dividing by 60. So 10/3 divided by 60 is 10/(3*60) = 10/180 = 1/18 fathoms per second. Wait, that seems really slow. 1/18 fathoms per second. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let's start from the beginning. The rower's speed is 20 staces per minute. First, convert staces to meters. If 1 stace is 1 meter, then 20 staces per minute is 20 meters per minute. Then convert meters per minute to fathoms per second. Since 1 fathom is 1.8288 meters, then 20 meters per minute is 20 / 1.8288 fathoms per minute. Let's calculate that: 20 / 1.8288 ≈ 10.9361 fathoms per minute. Then convert that to fathoms per second by dividing by 60: 10.9361 / 60 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second. Hmm, that's different from my previous answer. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the confusion comes from whether 1 stace is 1 meter or not. If the problem states that the rower's speed is 20 stópza na minute, maybe \"stópza\" is a different unit. Wait, in Polish, \"stópza\" could be \"stom\" (step) or \"stopa\" (foot), but in units, \"stópza\" might refer to \"stom\" as a foot? Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"20 stópza na minute\". So \"stópza\" is the unit. Let me check if there's a standard conversion for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stópza\" is a unit of distance in some European country. Wait, in some European countries, they use \"stópza\" as a unit of length equivalent to 0.3 meters. Let me check. If 1 stópza is 0.3 meters, then 20 stópza per minute is 6 meters per minute. Converting to fathoms: 1 fathom is 1.8288 meters, so 6 / 1.8288 ≈ 3.2808 fathoms per minute. Then per second: 3.2808 / 60 ≈ 0.0547 fathoms per second. That's even smaller. Hmm, so depending on the conversion factors, the answer varies.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem uses \"stópza\" as 1 meter. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"Rower poruszaся z prędkością 20 stópza na minute. Jaka jest prędkość roweru wyrażona w calach na sekundę?\" Translating this: \"The rower moves at a speed of 20 stópza per minute. What is the speed of the rower expressed in fathoms per second?\" So, the key is to figure out the conversion between stópza and fathoms.\n\nIf \"stópza\" is the same as \"stom\" (step) or \"stopa\" (foot), but in some contexts, \"stópza\" could be a different unit. Let me see. If 1 stópza is 1 meter, then 20 stópza per minute is 20 meters per minute. Then convert to fathoms: 1 fathom is 1.8288 meters, so 20 / 1.8288 ≈ 10.9361 fathoms per minute. Then per second: 10.9361 / 60 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second.\n\nAlternatively, if \"stópza\" is a different unit. Wait, maybe \"stópza\" is a unit used in rowing, and it's equivalent to 1.524 meters (like a meter in rowing is different? No, in rowing, the unit is probably different). Wait, maybe \"stópza\" is a unit of distance in some European system. Let me check an online source. However, since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on standard metric conversions.\n\nWait, perhaps in this context, \"stópza\" is a unit equivalent to 1 meter. Let's assume that 1 stópza = 1 meter. Then, 20 stópza per minute is 20 meters per minute. Convert to fathoms: 1 fathom is 1.8288 meters, so 20 / 1.8288 ≈ 10.9361 fathoms per minute. Then per second: 10.9361 / 60 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second. If we need to write this as a fraction, 20 divided by 1.8288 is approximately 10.9361, which divided by 60 is approximately 0.18227. Alternatively, let's do exact fractions.\n\nFirst, 20 meters per minute. Convert meters to fathoms: 1 fathom = 1.8288 meters. So 20 meters = 20 / 1.8288 fathoms. Let's compute 20 / 1.8288. 1.8288 is 6 feet (since 1 fathom = 6 feet). So 20 meters is 20 / 6 fathoms? Wait, no. 1 foot is 0.3048 meters, so 1 fathom is 6 feet = 1.8288 meters. Therefore, 1 meter = 1 / 1.8288 fathoms. So 20 meters = 20 / 1.8288 fathoms. Let's compute 20 / 1.8288. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 0.0001 to make it 200000 / 182.88. Hmm, maybe approximate. 1.8288 * 10 = 18.288, 1.8288 * 11 = 20.1168. So 20 / 1.8288 is approximately 10.9361, as before.\n\nThen, converting per minute to per second: 10.9361 / 60 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So the answer is approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second. But the question says \"wyražona w calach na sekundé\", which translates to \"expressed in fathoms per second\". So the answer is approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second. However, maybe the problem expects an exact fractional value. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the conversion factors are different. If 1 stace is 1 meter and 1 fathom is 1.8288 meters, then 20 meters per minute is 20 / 1.8288 fathoms per minute. Let's write that as a fraction: 20 / (1.8288) = 20 / (1.8288). Let's convert 1.8288 to a fraction. 1.8288 = 18288/10000 = 4572/2500 = 9144/5000 = 4572/2500. Wait, 4572 divided by 2 is 2286, 2500 divided by 2 is 1250. 2286/1250. Divide numerator and denominator by 2 again: 1143/625. So 1.8288 = 1143/625. Therefore, 20 / (1143/625) = 20 * (625/1143) = 12500 / 1143 ≈ 10.9361 fathoms per minute. Then divide by 60: 12500 / (1143 * 60) = 12500 / 68580 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So as a fraction, 12500/68580 simplifies. Let's see: divide numerator and denominator by 20: 625/3429. So approximately 625/3429 fathoms per second. But that's not a very clean answer. Maybe the problem expects a decimal or a simplified fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach. If 1 fathom is 6 feet and 1 stace is 1 foot, then 1 fathom is 6 staces. Therefore, 20 staces per minute is 20/6 = 10/3 fathoms per minute. Then convert to per second: 10/3 divided by 60 = 10/(3*60) = 10/180 = 1/18 fathoms per second. Wait, that's 1/18 ≈ 0.05555 fathoms per second. But this contradicts the previous calculation. So which is it?\n\nAh! Here's the confusion. If \"stópza\" is a unit equivalent to feet, then 1 stópza = 1 foot. Then 20 stópza per minute is 20 feet per minute. Convert to fathoms: 1 fathom = 6 feet, so 20 feet = 20/6 ≈ 3.333 fathoms per minute. Then per second: 3.333 / 60 ≈ 0.05555 fathoms per second. But that's conflicting with the previous result. So which is correct?\n\nThe problem is that the units \"stópza\" and \"fathoms\" are ambiguous. In the problem statement, it's crucial to know the exact conversion between stópza and meters or feet. Since the problem is in Polish, maybe \"stópza\" is a term used in Poland for a foot. However, in reality, the Polish word for foot is \"stopa\", and sometimes \"stópza\" could be a misspelling or confusion with another word. Alternatively, in some contexts, \"stópza\" might refer to a different unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this context, \"stópza\" is a unit of length equal to 0.3 meters, which is roughly a foot. If 1 stópza = 0.3 meters, then 20 stópza per minute is 6 meters per minute. Convert to fathoms: 1 fathom = 1.8288 meters, so 6 / 1.8288 ≈ 3.2808 fathoms per minute. Then per second: 3.2808 / 60 ≈ 0.0547 fathoms per second. So approximately 0.0547 fathoms per second.\n\nBut this is all speculative. Without knowing the exact conversion between stópza and fathoms, it's impossible to give an exact answer. However, given that the problem is likely inspired by a specific unit system, maybe the conversion is intended to be straightforward. Let's consider that in some historical contexts, a stace was 1 meter, and a fathom was 1.8288 meters. So converting 20 meters per minute to fathoms: 20 / 1.8288 ≈ 10.9361 fathoms per minute. Then to per second: 10.9361 / 60 ≈ 0.18227 fathoms per second. So approximately 0.1823 fathoms per second.\n\nAlternatively, if the conversion is 1 stace", "answer": "4"}

Na ile sposobów możemy utworzyć podkomisję złożoną z 5 członków, która ma co najmniej jednego członka z każdej partii?", "question": "Komisja Senatu składa się z 8 Republikanów i 6 Demokratów. Na ile sposobów możemy utworzyć podkomisję złożoną z 5 członków, która ma co najmniej jednego członka z każdej partii?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a committee made up of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. We need to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party. Hmm, so the subcommittee must have both Republicans and Democrats, right? Because if it's all Republicans or all Democrats, that wouldn't satisfy the \"at least one from each party\" condition. So, the question is asking for the number of ways to choose 5 people such that there's a mix of both parties. \n\nFirst, let's recall that when we need to count the number of ways to form a committee with certain conditions, sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possible committees and then subtract the ones that don't meet the conditions. In this case, the total number of ways to choose 5 people from the 14 (8+6) is C(14,5). Then, subtract the number of committees that are all Republicans and all Democrats. Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. The problem says \"at least one from each party,\" so we need to exclude committees that are all from one party. \n\nBut first, let's verify the total number of possible committees. The total number without any restrictions is indeed C(14,5). Then, the number of all-Republican committees would be C(8,5), since there are 8 Republicans. Similarly, the number of all-Democrat committees would be C(6,5), since there are 6 Democrats. So, the total number of valid committees would be C(14,5) - C(8,5) - C(6,5). \n\nLet me check if this approach is correct. If we subtract all the single-parties, then the remaining should be those committees that have at least one from each party. Since 5 people can't be split into two parties without having at least one from each, except for 1-4, 2-3, etc. Wait, but 5 people divided into two parties must have at least one from each if neither party has all 5. So, yes, subtracting all-5 from one party gives the correct count. \n\nAlternatively, we could calculate it directly by considering all possible distributions of Republicans and Democrats in the subcommittee. That is, the subcommittee can have 1 Republican and 4 Democrats, 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats, 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat. Then sum all these possibilities. That might be another way to approach it. Let's try that method as well to confirm.\n\nFirst, the total number of possible committees is C(14,5). Let me compute that. 14 choose 5 is 2002. Then, C(8,5) is 56, and C(6,5) is 6. So, 56 + 6 = 62. Then, 2002 - 62 = 1940. So, according to the first method, the answer is 1940. Now, let's check the second method.\n\nCalculating each case:\n\n1. 1 Republican and 4 Democrats: C(8,1) * C(6,4). C(8,1) is 8, C(6,4) is 15, so 8*15=120.\n\n2. 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats: C(8,2) * C(6,3). C(8,2) is 28, C(6,3) is 20, so 28*20=560.\n\n3. 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats: C(8,3) * C(6,2). C(8,3) is 56, C(6,2) is 15, so 56*15=840.\n\n4. 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat: C(8,4) * C(6,1). C(8,4) is 70, C(6,1) is 6, so 70*6=420.\n\nAdding all these up: 120 + 560 = 680; 680 + 840 = 1520; 1520 + 420 = 1940. So, same result as before. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 1940.\n\nBut let me just make sure there's no mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck the numbers:\n\nTotal committees: C(14,5) = 2002. Correct. Because 14*13*12*11*10 / 5*4*3*2*1 = (14*13*12*11*10)/120. Let's compute that: 14*13=182, 182*12=2184, 2184*11=24024, 24024*10=240240. Divide by 120: 240240 / 120 = 2002. Correct.\n\nAll-Republican: C(8,5). 8*7*6*5*4 / 5*4*3*2*1 = 70. Wait, 8 choose 5 is 56? Wait, hold on. Wait, 8 choose 5 is equal to 8! / (5! * 3!) = (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = 56. Yes, correct. And 6 choose 5 is 6. So, 56 + 6 = 62. Then 2002 - 62 = 1940. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, when calculating directly:\n\n1. 1R, 4D: 8 * 15 = 120. 6 choose 4 is 15. Correct.\n\n2. 2R, 3D: 28 * 20 = 560. 8 choose 2 is 28, 6 choose 3 is 20. Correct.\n\n3. 3R, 2D: 56 * 15 = 840. 8 choose 3 is 56, 6 choose 2 is 15. Correct.\n\n4. 4R, 1D: 70 * 6 = 420. 8 choose 4 is 70, 6 choose 1 is 6. Correct.\n\nSumming all: 120 + 560 = 680; 680 + 840 = 1520; 1520 + 420 = 1940. Correct. So, both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the answer should be 1940.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's see if there's another way to approach this. For example, inclusion-exclusion. But I think the two methods we've used are sufficient. The first method is total minus the bad ones, the second is summing the good ones. Both give 1940, so I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using generating functions? Let's see. For Republicans, the generating function is (1 + x)^8, and for Democrats, it's (1 + x)^6. The generating function for the total is (1 + x)^14. But we need the coefficient of x^5 in the product of the generating functions for each party, but subtracting the cases where all are from one party. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the generating function for the valid committees would be [(1 + x)^8 - x^8][(1 + x)^6 - x^6], and then take the coefficient of x^5. Let's check.\n\nFirst, [(1 + x)^8 - x^8] represents choosing any number of Republicans except all 8. Similarly, [(1 + x)^6 - x^6] represents choosing any number of Democrats except all 6. Then multiplying these two gives the generating function for committees with at least one from each party, but not necessarily exactly 5. Wait, but we need the coefficient of x^5. So, the coefficient of x^5 in [(1 + x)^8 - x^8][(1 + x)^6 - x^6] would be the number of committees of exactly 5 with at least one from each party. Let's compute that.\n\nExpanding [(1 + x)^8 - x^8][(1 + x)^6 - x^6] = (1 + x)^8*(1 + x)^6 - x^8*(1 + x)^6 - (1 + x)^8*x^6 + x^8*x^6.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1 + x)^14 - x^8*(1 + x)^6 - x^6*(1 + x)^8 + x^14.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^5 in this expression is equal to the coefficient of x^5 in (1 + x)^14 minus the coefficient of x^5 in x^8*(1 + x)^6 minus the coefficient of x^5 in x^6*(1 + x)^8 plus the coefficient of x^5 in x^14.\n\nBut the last term, x^14, doesn't contribute to x^5. Similarly, the other terms:\n\nCoefficient of x^5 in (1 + x)^14 is C(14,5) = 2002.\n\nCoefficient of x^5 in x^8*(1 + x)^6 is equal to the coefficient of x^{5 - 8} = x^{-3} in (1 + x)^6, which is zero.\n\nSimilarly, coefficient of x^5 in x^6*(1 + x)^8 is the coefficient of x^{5 - 6} = x^{-1} in (1 + x)^8, which is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^5 is 2002 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 2002. Wait, but that's the total number of committees, which contradicts. Wait, this approach seems to have an error. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the generating function [(1 + x)^8 - x^8][(1 + x)^6 - x^6], when we expand, we need to subtract the cases where all Republicans or all Democrats are chosen, but when considering exactly 5 people, the generating function would actually be [(1 + x)^8 - x^8 - (1 + x)^8*x^5] and similarly for Democrats. Wait, maybe I messed up the generating function approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the generating function should be [(1 + x)^8 - x^8 - x^5*(1 + x)^8] * [(1 + x)^6 - x^6 - x^5*(1 + x)^6] but that complicates things. Maybe this is not the right way. Alternatively, for committees with exactly 5 members and at least one from each party, the generating function would be [(1 + x)^8 - x^8 - x^5*(1 + x)^8] * [(1 + x)^6 - x^6 - x^5*(1 + x)^6] but this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the generating function approach is not necessary here since the two methods we used already confirm the answer. But just to check, let's see. If we compute the coefficient of x^5 in [(1 + x)^8 - x^8][(1 + x)^6 - x^6], which is the same as (1 + x)^14 - x^8*(1 + x)^6 - x^6*(1 + x)^8 + x^14. Then, the coefficient of x^5 is C(14,5) - [coefficient of x^5 in x^8*(1 + x)^6] - [coefficient of x^5 in x^6*(1 + x)^8] + [coefficient of x^5 in x^14]. The first term is 2002. The other two terms: coefficient of x^{-3} in (1 + x)^6 is 0, and coefficient of x^{-1} in (1 + x)^8 is 0, so total is 2002. But that's the same as the total number of committees. Which contradicts, so this approach is wrong. Therefore, maybe the generating function needs to be adjusted differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the generating function for the valid committees is [(1 + x)^8 - x^8 - x^5*(1 + x)^8] * [(1 + x)^6 - x^6 - x^5*(1 + x)^6] but that seems overcomplicated. Alternatively, perhaps the generating function should subtract the cases where all are from one party and subtract the cases where exactly 5 are chosen. Hmm, perhaps not. I think this method is getting too convoluted, and since we already have two correct methods giving 1940, maybe it's better to stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1940.

{"original_question": "Jaka jest wartość $513^2 - 487^2$?", "question": "Jaka jest wartość $513^2 - 487^2$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of 513 squared minus 487 squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember there's a formula for the difference of squares, right? It goes like a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can use that here instead of calculating each square separately, which might take longer and be more error-prone.\n\nAlright, let me apply the formula. Here, a is 513 and b is 487. So substituting into the formula, that would be (513 - 487) multiplied by (513 + 487). Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the difference between 513 and 487. 513 minus 487. Let's see, 513 minus 400 is 113, then minus 87 more. 113 minus 87 is... 26. So that part is 26.\n\nNext, the sum of 513 and 487. 513 plus 487. Let's add 500 and 400 first, which is 900. Then the remaining parts: 13 and 87. 13 plus 87 is 100. So altogether, 900 plus 100 is 1000. Wait, that seems right. 513 + 487 = 1000.\n\nSo now, according to the formula, the original expression simplifies to 26 multiplied by 1000. That should be straightforward. 26 times 1000 is 26,000. So the value of 513² - 487² is 26,000.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's verify by calculating 513² and 487² separately and then subtracting them. Although this might take more time, it's a good way to confirm.\n\nFirst, 513 squared. Let's compute that. 500 squared is 250,000. Then, (500 + 13)² = 500² + 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 250,000 + 13,000 is 263,000, plus 169 is 263,169. So 513² is 263,169.\n\nNow, 487 squared. Let's compute that. 500 - 13 squared. So (500 - 13)² = 500² - 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 - 13,000 + 169 = 250,000 - 13,000 is 237,000, plus 169 is 237,169. So 487² is 237,169.\n\nSubtracting them: 263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract the numbers. 263,169 - 200,000 = 63,169. Then subtract 37,000 more: 63,169 - 37,000 = 26,169. Wait, that's 26,169. But earlier, using the difference of squares, I got 26,000. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract step by step. 263,169 minus 237,169. Subtract the hundreds: 263,169 - 237,169. Since both numbers end with 169, subtracting them would give 26,000. Wait, but 263,169 - 237,169 is actually (263,169 - 237,169) = 26,000. Wait, but when I did the separate calculation, I thought it was 26,169, but that's incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, 263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract 200,000 from both: 263,169 - 200,000 = 63,169; 237,169 - 200,000 = 37,169. Then 63,169 - 37,169. Subtract 30,000 from both: 63,169 - 30,000 = 33,169; 37,169 - 30,000 = 7,169. Then subtract 7,000 from 33,169: 33,169 - 7,000 = 26,169. Wait, so actually, it is 26,169. But according to the difference of squares, it should be 26,000. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, so using the formula, I have (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26*1000 = 26,000. But when calculating directly, I get 26,169. So there's a mistake somewhere. Let me check my direct computation again.\n\nFirst, 513 squared: 513*513. Let me compute this again. 500*500 = 250,000. 500*13 = 6,500. 13*500 = 6,500. 13*13 = 169. So using the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a = 500 and b = 13. So 500² + 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 263,169. That seems correct.\n\n487 squared: 487*487. Let's compute this again. Using (500 - 13)^2 = 500² - 2*500*13 + 13² = 250,000 - 13,000 + 169 = 237,000 + 169 = 237,169. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting 237,169 from 263,169: 263,169 - 237,169. Let's subtract 237,169 from 263,169. 237,169 + 26,000 = 263,169. So yes, 263,169 - 237,169 = 26,000. Wait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step subtraction, I thought it was 26,169. But that was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\n263,169 minus 237,169. Let's subtract 237,169 from 263,169. \n\nStart with the thousands place: 263,169 is 263 thousand and 169, 237,169 is 237 thousand and 169. Subtracting 237 thousand from 263 thousand gives 26 thousand. Then subtract 169 from 169, which is 0. So total is 26,000. So that's correct. My earlier step-by-step subtraction had a mistake in the calculation. So actually, the correct result is 26,000. So both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 26,000.\n\nTherefore, the value of 513² - 487² is 26,000. So the difference of squares formula worked perfectly here, avoiding the need to compute large squares directly. That was smarter. So I was initially confused when I thought there was a discrepancy, but it was due to an error in my step-by-step subtraction. So the correct answer is 26,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\boxed{26000}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\), we can use the difference of squares formula, which states \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n\nFirst, we identify \\(a = 513\\) and \\(b = 487\\). Applying the formula:\n\n\\[\n513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)\n\\]\n\nCalculating the difference and sum:\n\n\\[\n513 - 487 = 26\n\\]\n\\[\n513 + 487 = 1000\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results together:\n\n\\[\n26 \\times 1000 = 26000\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can compute \\(513^2\\) and \\(487^2\\) separately and then subtract them. However, using the difference of squares formula confirms that the result is correct without needing to calculate the squares directly.\n\nThus, the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{26000}\\).", "answer": "26000"}

Let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have three consecutive integers whose product is 120. Then, when we divide that product by the average of those three numbers, the result is 24. We need to find the largest of these three numbers.\n\nFirst, let's denote the three consecutive integers. Since they are consecutive, we can call them n-1, n, and n+1. That way, they are in a sequence without any gaps. Let me check that: if n is the middle number, then the previous one is n-1 and the next one is n+1. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, their product is (n-1)*n*(n+1) = 120. Let's write that down:\n\n(n - 1) * n * (n + 1) = 120\n\nNow, the second part says that the product divided by the average of these three numbers is 24. The average of the three numbers is [(n - 1) + n + (n + 1)] / 3. Let's compute that:\n\nAverage = (n - 1 + n + n + 1) / 3 = (3n) / 3 = n\n\nOh, interesting! The average of three consecutive numbers is just the middle number, n. So, dividing the product by the average (which is n) gives 24. Therefore:\n\nProduct / Average = 24\n120 / n = 24\n\nSo, 120 divided by n equals 24. Therefore, solving for n:\n\nn = 120 / 24 = 5\n\nSo, n is 5. Therefore, the three consecutive numbers are 4, 5, and 6. The largest of these is 6. Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes these problems can have multiple solutions or maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nFirst, check the product: 4 * 5 * 6 = 120. That's correct. Then, the average is (4 + 5 + 6)/3 = 15/3 = 5. Then, 120 / 5 = 24. That's exactly what the problem states. So, seems like 6 is the answer. But let me double-check because maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, could there be negative numbers involved? The problem didn't specify that the numbers are positive. Let's see. If n is -5, then the numbers would be -6, -5, -4. Their product is (-6)*(-5)*(-4) = -120. But the problem says the product is 120, so negative numbers would give a negative product, which doesn't match. So, n can't be negative here. So, the only possible solution is 4, 5, 6. Therefore, the largest number is 6.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I should solve the equations step by step algebraically to confirm.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. (n - 1) * n * (n + 1) = 120\n2. 120 / n = 24\n\nFrom equation 2, n = 120 / 24 = 5. Then substitute into equation 1: (5 - 1)*5*(5 + 1) = 4*5*6 = 120. Correct. So, yes, n=5, numbers are 4,5,6. Largest is 6.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if there are other solutions. For example, if n is different. Let's suppose n is not 5. Let's try n=6. Then the numbers are 5,6,7. Product is 5*6*7=210, which is more than 120. If n=4, numbers are 3,4,5. Product is 3*4*5=60, which is less than 120. So, 5 is the only integer that gives 120. Therefore, n=5 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe solving the cubic equation (n - 1) * n * (n + 1) = 120. Let's expand that:\n\n(n - 1)(n + 1) = n^2 - 1, so the product is n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n. So:\n\nn^3 - n = 120\n\nn^3 - n - 120 = 0\n\nWe can try to factor this. Let's test possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are divisors of 120. Let's try n=5: 125 - 5 - 120 = 0. Yes, works. So, (n - 5) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.\n\nDivide n^3 - n - 120 by (n - 5). Using synthetic division:\n\n5 | 1  0  -1  -120\n\n          5   25    120\n\n      1  5   24     0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (n - 5)(n^2 + 5n + 24) = 0. The quadratic equation n^2 + 5n + 24 = 0 has discriminant 25 - 96 = -71, which is negative, so no real roots. Therefore, the only real solution is n=5. Hence, the numbers are 4,5,6, and the largest is 6. So, answer is 6.\n\nBut let me check once again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the problem says that the product of three consecutive integers is 120, and when divided by their average, it's 24. We found that the three numbers are 4,5,6. Their product is 120, their average is 5, and 120 divided by 5 is 24. So, all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the largest number is 6. I think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest of the three consecutive integers is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). Their product is given as 120:\n\n\\[\n(n - 1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n + 1) = 120\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the product divided by the average of these three numbers is 24. The average of the three numbers is \\( n \\), so we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{n} = 24\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{120}{24} = 5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( n = 5 \\) into the three consecutive integers, we get \\( 4 \\), \\( 5 \\), and \\( 6 \\).

The equation given is the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) equals 16. Hmm, so I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. Let me start by writing down the equation properly.\n\nThe cube root of something equals 16. So, in mathematical terms, that would be:\n\n∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nSince it's a cube root, not a square root, I don't have to worry about the principal root being positive or negative. But maybe I should check if there are any restrictions on x later. Anyway, to get rid of the cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. Let me do that.\n\nCubing both sides gives:\n\n(x² - 4x + 4) = 16³\n\nLet me compute 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is 4096. So:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nHmm, okay. So the quadratic equation is x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. Let me see if I can factor this, but given the large constant term, it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = -4, c = -4092.\n\nWait, let me check the coefficients again. The equation is x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. So a = 1, b = -4, c = -4092. Plugging into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -(-4) ± √( (-4)² - 4 * 1 * (-4092) ) ] / (2 * 1)\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx = [ 4 ± √(16 + 16368) ] / 2\n\nBecause the discriminant is 16 - 4 * 1 * (-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384\n\nSo the square root of 16384. Let me check what is the square root of 16384. Hmm, 128 squared is 16384 because 128 * 128 = 16384. Let me verify:\n\n128 * 128: 100*100=10,000; 100*28=2,800; 28*100=2,800; 28*28=784. So total is 10,000 + 2,800 + 2,800 + 784 = 16,384. Yes, that's correct. So √16384 = 128.\n\nTherefore, x = [4 ± 128]/2\n\nSo that gives two solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x. So x = 66 is the answer. Let me check if this is correct by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nCompute x² - 4x + 4 when x = 66:\n\n66² = 4356\n\n4x = 4*66 = 264\n\nSo, 4356 - 264 + 4 = 4356 - 264 = 4092; 4092 + 4 = 4096\n\nSo inside the cube root: ∛4096\n\nBut 16³ is 4096, so ∛4096 = 16. Which matches the right side of the equation. So that works.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, check the other solution x = -62.

So x = -62 also satisfies the equation.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities that might help here. Maybe product-to-sum formulas? But those usually turn products into sums, which might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the angles that I can exploit?\n\nFirst, let me note that the angles are doubling each time: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, right? Because π is 15π/15, so 16π/15 is π + π/15. So cos(16π/15) is the same as cos(π + π/15), which is equal to -cos(π/15) because cosine is negative in the third quadrant and cos(π + x) = -cos(x). So maybe that term can be rewritten as -cos(π/15). Let me check that:\n\ncos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). Yes, that's right. So the product becomes:\n\ncos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * (-cos(π/15)).\n\nSo that's -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Hmm, so now I have a product of cosines with angles doubling each time, starting from π/15 up to 8π/15. This seems similar to a geometric sequence of angles. Maybe there's a formula for the product of cosines in such a sequence?\n\nI remember that there is a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one. Let me recall. For example, the product formula for cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) is sin(2^n θ) / (2^n sinθ). Is that right? Let me verify for a small n. Let's take n=2: cosθ * cos2θ = [sin4θ]/[4 sinθ]. Wait, let me check:\n\nUsing the identity sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so cosθ = sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ). Then cosθ * cos2θ = [sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ)] * cos2θ. Then, similarly, cos2θ = sin(4θ)/(2 sin2θ). So substituting that in, we get [sin2θ * sin4θ] / [4 sinθ sin2θ] = sin4θ / (4 sinθ). So indeed, for n=2, the product is sin4θ/(4 sinθ). So generalizing, for n terms, the product is sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). \n\nSo in our case, the product is cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Here, θ is π/15, and the exponents are 0,1,2,3 (since 8π/15 = 2^3 * π/15). So the product would be sin(2^4 * π/15) / (2^4 sin(π/15)) = sin(16π/15) / (16 sin(π/15)). \n\nBut sin(16π/15): 16π/15 is π + π/15, so sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, substituting back, the product is (-sinπ/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original product is -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = -(-1/16) = 1/16? Wait, hold on. Wait, the product cos(π/15)...cos(8π/15) is equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = (-sinπ/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal expression after substituting cos(16π/15) as -cos(π/15) becomes:\n\n- cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = - [cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15)]\n\nBut if the product inside the brackets is equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = (-sinπ/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the entire expression is -(-1/16) = 1/16. So the final result is 1/16. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again step by step. The product inside the brackets: cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15). Using the formula for the product of cosines with angles doubling each time: sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). Here, n=4 (since we have four terms: θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ), so 2^4 θ = 16θ. Here, θ is π/15. So 2^4 θ = 16π/15. So the formula gives sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)). But sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)) = (-sinπ/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the product inside the brackets is -1/16. Then the original expression is - [ -1/16 ] = 1/16. So yes, the answer is 1/16.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity?\n\nThe angles 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15 are all related to the 15th roots of unity. Let's consider the 15th roots of unity, which are e^(2πik/15) for k=0,1,...,14. The product we're looking at involves cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and cos(16π/15). Note that 16π/15 is equivalent to (16π/15 - 2π) = (16π/15 - 30π/15) = -14π/15, but cosine is even, so cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15). Wait, but 14π/15 is π - π/15, so cos(14π/15) = -cos(π/15). So again, we have the same as before: cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So the product is -cos(π/15)cos(2π/15)cos(4π/15)cos(8π/15).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for multiple angles. Let's recall that the product of cosines can sometimes be related to Chebyshev polynomials or other trigonometric identities. Alternatively, perhaps considering the polynomial whose roots are these cosines. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity that the product of cos(θ)cos(2θ)...cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). As we used earlier. So in this case, with θ = π/15 and n=4, the product is sin(16π/15)/(16 sinπ/15). But sin(16π/15) is sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, the product is -sinπ/15/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the numerical value using approximate numbers to check. Let's compute each cosine term:\n\nFirst, 2π/15 ≈ 2*3.1416/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians. cos(0.4189) ≈ 0.9135.\n\n4π/15 ≈ 0.8378 radians. cos(0.8378) ≈ 0.6691.\n\n8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians. cos(1.6755) ≈ 0.0785.\n\n16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians. cos(3.3510) ≈ cos(π + π/15) ≈ -cos(π/15) ≈ -0.9781.\n\nMultiplying these together: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6095; 0.0785 * (-0.9781) ≈ -0.0768. Then 0.6095 * (-0.0768) ≈ -0.0468. But 1/16 is 0.0625. Hmm, this gives approximately -0.0468, which is not 0.0625. Wait, that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here. So either my calculation is wrong or the answer is actually -1/16? But according to the earlier steps, the answer should be 1/16. But numerically, it's giving me approximately -0.0468. Wait, maybe I made an error in the numerical calculation.\n\nWait, let me check each term again.\n\nFirst, 2π/15: 2*3.1415926535/15 ≈ 6.283185307/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. cos(0.418879) ≈ 0.9135. Correct.\n\n4π/15: 4*3.1415926535/15 ≈ 12.56637061/15 ≈ 0.837758 radians. cos(0.837758) ≈ 0.6691. Correct.\n\n8π/15: 8*3.1415926535/15 ≈ 25.13274123/15 ≈ 1.675516 radians. cos(1.675516) ≈ 0.0785. Correct.\n\n16π/15: 16*3.1415926535/15 ≈ 50.26548206/15 ≈ 3.351032 radians. cos(3.351032) ≈ cos(π + π/15) ≈ -cos(π/15). π/15 ≈ 0.2094 radians. cos(0.2094) ≈ 0.9781. Therefore, cos(3.351032) ≈ -0.9781. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.9135*0.6691. Let's compute 0.9*0.6 = 0.54, 0.9*0.0691 ≈ 0.0622, 0.0135*0.6 ≈ 0.0081, 0.0135*0.0691≈0.00093. Adding up: 0.54 + 0.0622 = 0.6022; 0.6022 + 0.0081 = 0.6103; 0.6103 + 0.00093 ≈ 0.6112. So 0.9135*0.6691 ≈ 0.6112.\n\nThen 0.0785 * (-0.9781) ≈ -0.0785*0.9781. Let's compute 0.07*0.9781 ≈ 0.0685, 0.0085*0.9781 ≈ 0.0083. So total ≈ 0.0685 + 0.0083 ≈ 0.0768. Therefore, 0.0785 * (-0.9781) ≈ -0.0768.\n\nThen multiply 0.6112 * (-0.0768) ≈ -0.6112*0.", "answer": "\\frac{1}{16}"}

There's a point D on AM such that AD = 10, and angle BDC is three times angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the height AM is also the median and the angle bisector. So point M is the midpoint of BC. That means BM = MC. Let me denote the length of BC as 2x, so BM = MC = x. Then, since AM is the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABM. AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2. We know AM is 11, so AB = sqrt(11^2 + x^2). Therefore, the sides AB and AC are equal to sqrt(121 + x^2), and BC is 2x. So the perimeter would be 2*sqrt(121 + x^2) + 2x. But I need to find x first.\n\nNow, point D is on AM such that AD = 10, so since AM is 11, then DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1. So D is 10 units from A and 1 unit from M. The problem states that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. My goal is to relate θ and 3θ using the given lengths and the positions of D.\n\nI think I need to use trigonometry here. Maybe the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles BDC and BAC. Let me consider triangles BDC and BAC. Since ABC is isosceles, angle BAC is θ, so the base angles at B and C are (180° - θ)/2 each. But angle BDC is 3θ. Let me try to express angle BDC in terms of θ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at (0, 11), since AM is the height of 11 units. Then point M is the midpoint of BC, which is on the x-axis. Let me denote point M as (0, 0) since AM is vertical. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, M is the midpoint of BC. If AM is the height, then M is the midpoint. But in the Asymptote code, they draw A at (0,11), B at (-11/2, 0), C at (11/2, 0), so M is (0,0). So actually, AM is from (0,11) to (0,0), which is 11 units. Then point D is on AM with AD = 10, so D is at (0,1), since from A (0,11) down 10 units to (0,1). Then BC is from (-11/2,0) to (11/2,0), so BC has length 11. Wait, but in the problem, BC is 2x. So in this case, x would be 11/2. But then the perimeter would be 2*sqrt(121 + (121/4)) + 11. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, sqrt(121 + 121/4) = sqrt( (484 + 121)/4 ) = sqrt(605/4) = sqrt(605)/2. So perimeter is 2*(sqrt(605)/2) + 11 = sqrt(605) + 11. But sqrt(605) is sqrt(121*5) = 11*sqrt(5). So perimeter would be 11*sqrt(5) + 11. But that's approximately 11*2.236 + 11 ≈ 24.596 + 11 ≈ 35.596. But is this correct? Wait, but in the Asymptote code, BC is from (-11/2,0) to (11/2,0), so BC is 11 units. So in this case, x = 11/2. So perimeter is 2*sqrt(121 + (121/4)) + 11. Which is 2*sqrt( (484 + 121)/4 ) + 11 = 2*(sqrt(605)/2) + 11 = sqrt(605) + 11 ≈ 11*2.236 + 11 ≈ 35.596. But the problem says there's a point D such that angle BDC = 3 angle BAC. In the Asymptote code, they drew D at (0,1), which is 10 units from A (0,11). But in that case, angle BDC is angle at D between points B, D, C. Let me compute angle BDC in that case. Coordinates: B is (-5.5,0), D is (0,1), C is (5.5,0). So triangle BDC has points at (-5.5,0), (0,1), (5.5,0). So BD and CD are equal, since it's symmetric. Let's compute the angle at D. The vectors from D to B and D to C are (-5.5, -1) and (5.5, -1). The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product. The dot product is (-5.5)(5.5) + (-1)(-1) = -30.25 + 1 = -29.25. The magnitude of each vector is sqrt(5.5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(30.25 + 1) = sqrt(31.25) ≈ 5.59. So the cosine of angle BDC is (-29.25)/(5.59^2) ≈ (-29.25)/(31.25) ≈ -0.936. So angle BDC is arccos(-0.936) ≈ 159.8 degrees. Angle BAC in the Asymptote code is angle at A between B and C. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angle BAC is the angle at A. Coordinates: A(0,11), B(-5.5,0), C(5.5,0). The vectors AB and AC are (-5.5, -11) and (5.5, -11). The angle between them can be found via the dot product: (-5.5)(5.5) + (-11)(-11) = -30.25 + 121 = 90.75. The magnitudes of AB and AC are both sqrt(5.5^2 + 11^2) = sqrt(30.25 + 121) = sqrt(151.25) ≈ 12.3. So cos(theta) = 90.75/(12.3^2) ≈ 90.75/151.29 ≈ 0.599. So theta ≈ arccos(0.599) ≈ 53.1 degrees. Then angle BDC is 159.8 degrees, which is roughly 3*53.1 ≈ 159.3 degrees. That's close, considering the approximations. So maybe the Asymptote code is just an example, and the actual problem might have different proportions but the same ratio. So in this case, with BC = 11, the perimeter is 11*sqrt(5) + 11 ≈ 35.596. But the problem states that such a point D exists where angle BDC = 3 angle BAC. So maybe in the Asymptote code, it's just an illustration, but the actual problem requires solving for x such that this angle condition holds. So perhaps in the problem, BC is not 11, but another length, and we need to find x such that angle BDC = 3 angle BAC.\n\nSo let's denote the coordinates properly. Let me set coordinate system with point A at (0, 11), M at (0, 0), so D is at (0, 10) because AD = 10. Wait, no. If AM is 11, and AD = 10, then since A is at (0,11) and M is at (0,0), then D is 10 units from A along AM. So starting at A (0,11), moving down 10 units along the y-axis to (0,1). So D is at (0,1). Then BC is from (-x,0) to (x,0), so BC has length 2x. So points B(-x,0), C(x,0), M(0,0). Then angle BAC is the angle at A between AB and AC. Let me compute angle BAC. The vectors AB and AC are (-x, -11) and (x, -11). The angle between them can be found by the dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (AB . AC) / (|AB||AC|)\n\nAB . AC = (-x)(x) + (-11)(-11) = -x² + 121\n\n|AB| = |AC| = sqrt(x² + 121)\n\nSo cos(theta) = (-x² + 121)/(x² + 121)\n\nSo theta = arccos( (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) )\n\nAlternatively, we can express theta in terms of tan(theta/2). Maybe that's useful.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinate geometry, we can find the coordinates of D, which is (0,1), and then compute angle BDC.\n\nPoints B(-x,0), D(0,1), C(x,0). So angle BDC is the angle at D between points B and C. To find angle BDC, we can compute the vectors DB and DC and use the dot product.\n\nVector DB = B - D = (-x - 0, 0 - 1) = (-x, -1)\n\nVector DC = C - D = (x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1)\n\nThe angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC. Let's compute the cosine of this angle:\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (DB . DC) / (|DB||DC|)\n\nDB .

{"original_question": "Suma 27 kolejnych dodatnich liczb całkowitych wynosi $3^7$. Jaka jest ich mediana?", "question": "Suma 27 kolejnych dodatnich liczb całkowitych wynosi $3^7$. Jaka jest ich mediana?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is equal to 3^7, and we need to find their median. Hmm. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a sequence of consecutive numbers, the median is the middle number. Since there are 27 numbers, which is an odd count, the median will be the 14th term. So, if I can figure out what that middle term is, I have the median.\n\nNow, the sum of these numbers is given as 3^7. Let me calculate what 3^7 is. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, and 3^7 is 2187. So the sum is 2187.\n\nAlright, so we have 27 consecutive numbers adding up to 2187. Let me think about how to model this. If I let the first number be n, then the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, ..., up to n+26. The median would be the 14th term, which is n + 13. So, if I can find n, I can just add 13 to it to get the median.\n\nAnother way to approach the sum of consecutive numbers is using the formula for an arithmetic series. The sum S of k terms where the first term is a and the last term is l is S = k*(a + l)/2. In this case, since it's consecutive numbers, the difference is 1. So, the last term is n + 26. Therefore, the sum should be 27*(n + (n + 26))/2. Let me write that out:\n\nSum = 27*(2n + 26)/2 = 27*(n + 13)\n\nBut the sum is given as 2187. So:\n\n27*(n + 13) = 2187\n\nTo find n + 13, divide both sides by 27:\n\nn + 13 = 2187 / 27\n\nLet me compute that. 27 * 81 = 2187, right? Because 27*80=2160, and 27*1=27, so 2160+27=2187. So 2187 divided by 27 is 81. Therefore:\n\nn + 13 = 81\n\nTherefore, the median, which is n + 13, is 81. Wait, that seems straightforward. So the median is 81.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's verify the sum with the median. If the median is 81, then the sequence is from 81 - 13 = 68 up to 81 + 13 = 94. So the numbers are 68 to 94 inclusive. Let's check the number of terms. 94 - 68 + 1 = 27. Correct. Now, the sum can be calculated as 27*(first term + last term)/2 = 27*(68 + 94)/2 = 27*(162)/2 = 27*81 = 2187. Which matches the given sum. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the median is indeed 81. Hmm, seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe median is \\boxed{81}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is \\(3^7\\), we need to find their median.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(3^7\\):\n\\[\n3^7 = 2187\n\\]\n\nWe know the sum of an arithmetic series is given by \\(S = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (a + l)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term. For 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th term, which is \\(n + 13\\) if the first term is \\(n\\).\n\nUsing the arithmetic series formula:\n\\[\n27 \\times \\frac{2n + 26}{2} = 2187\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\\[\n27 \\times (n + 13) = 2187\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n + 13\\):\n\\[\nn + 13 = \\frac{2187}{27} = 81\n\\]\n\nThus, the median, which is \\(n + 13\\), is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{81}\n\\]\n\nVerification: The sequence from 68 to 94 (27 terms) has a median of 81.

Wyraź odpowiedź w notacji przedziałowej.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this inequality: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Hmm, let's break it down into two parts. First, the left part: -4 < x⁴ + 4x², and the right part: x⁴ + 4x² < 21. I'll solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: -4 < x⁴ + 4x². Let's rearrange it to x⁴ + 4x² + 4 > 0. Wait, x⁴ + 4x² + 4 is a perfect square. Let me check: (x² + 2)² = x⁴ + 4x² + 4. Yes, exactly. So the inequality becomes (x² + 2)² > 0. Now, since a square is always non-negative, and x² + 2 is always positive because x² is non-negative and adding 2 makes it at least 2. Therefore, (x² + 2)² is always greater than or equal to 4. Wait, but 4 is greater than 0, so the square is always positive. Therefore, (x² + 2)² > 0 is always true for all real x. So the left inequality doesn't restrict x at all. That's good to know.\n\nNow the right inequality: x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Let's rearrange that to x⁴ + 4x² - 21 < 0. Hmm, this is a quartic equation. Maybe I can substitute y = x², so the inequality becomes y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Let's solve this quadratic inequality for y. First, find the roots of y² + 4y - 21 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)] / 2 = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2. So the roots are ( -4 + 10 ) / 2 = 6/2 = 3, and ( -4 - 10 ) / 2 = -14/2 = -7. So the quadratic factors as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0. The roots divide the number line into three intervals: y < -7, -7 < y < 3, and y > 3. Since the coefficient of y² is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 holds when y is between -7 and 3.\n\nBut remember, y = x², and x² is always non-negative. So y ≥ 0. Therefore, the interval -7 < y < 3 is equivalent to 0 ≤ y < 3. So substituting back, x² < 3. Therefore, x must satisfy -√3 < x < √3. So the solution to the right inequality is x ∈ (-√3, √3).\n\nTherefore, combining both inequalities, the original inequality -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21 is satisfied when x ∈ (-√3, √3). But wait, let me double-check. Since the left inequality was always true, the only restriction comes from the right inequality. So the solution is indeed (-√3, √3). Let me verify with some test values.\n\nTake x = 0: 0 + 0 = 0, which is between -4 and 21. Good.\n\nTake x = 1: 1 + 4 = 5, which is between -4 and 21. Good.\n\nTake x = √3: (√3)^4 + 4*(√3)^2 = (9) + 4*3 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included. Similarly for x = -√3. So the interval is open, which matches our solution.\n\nWhat about x = 2: 16 + 16 = 32, which is greater than 21, so it's excluded. Correct.\n\nx = 0.5: 0.0625 + 1 = 1.0625, which is within the range. Good.\n\nSo yes, the solution set is all real numbers x between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution in interval notation is \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\) for real values of \\(x\\), we break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Left Inequality: \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\)**\n   - Rearrange to \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\\).\n   - Recognize that \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4\\) is a perfect square: \\((x^2 + 2)^2\\).\n   - Since \\((x^2 + 2)^2\\) is always non-negative and at least 4 for all real \\(x\\), this inequality is always true.\n\n2. **Right Inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)**\n   - Rearrange to \\(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\\).\n   - Substitute \\(y = x^2\\), transforming the inequality to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\).\n   - Solve the quadratic inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n     - Roots: \\(y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = 3\\) and \\(-7\\).\n     - The quadratic factors as \\((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\\), which holds for \\(-7 < y < 3\\).\n   - Since \\(y = x^2 \\geq 0\\), we consider \\(0 \\leq y < 3\\), leading to \\(x^2 < 3\\).\n   - Solving \\(x^2 < 3\\) gives \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nCombining both parts, the solution to the original inequality is the interval where the right inequality holds, as the left inequality is always true.

Let's break it down:\n\n118 * 1.35 = ?\n\n118 * 1 = 118\n\n118 * 0.3 = 35.4\n\n118 * 0.05 = 5.9\n\nAdding up: 118 + 35.4 = 153.4 + 5.9 = 159.3\n\nThen 0.2 * 1.35 = 0.27\n\nSo total is 159.3 + 0.27 = 159.57\n\nWait, maybe another way: 118.2 * 1.35\n\n118.2 * 1 = 118.2\n\n118.2 * 0.3 = 35.46\n\n118.2 * 0.05 = 5.91\n\n118.2 * 0.00 = 0 (since 1.35 is 1 + 0.3 + 0.05)\n\nAdding those: 118.2 + 35.46 = 153.66 + 5.91 = 159.57\n\nSo 1.35 * 118.2 = 159.57\n\nNow, the male usage is 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\n\nSo the difference between 123.3 and 159.57 is |123.3 - 159.57| = 36.27\n\nThat's the difference for 9th grade.\n\nNow, moving to 10th grade:\n\n- Male usage: 34.4%\n- Female usage: 33.1%\n\nFemale usage: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331 * 300 = 99.3\n\n1.35 * 99.3 = ?\n\nCalculating 99.3 * 1.35:\n\n99 * 1.35 = 133.65\n\n0.3 * 1.35 = 0.405\n\nSo total is 133.65 + 0.405 = 134.055\n\nAlternatively, 99.3 * 1.35:\n\nBreaking down:\n\n99.3 * 1 = 99.3\n\n99.3 * 0.3 = 29.79\n\n99.3 * 0.05 = 4.965\n\n99.3 * 0.00 = 0 (since 1.35 is 1 + 0.3 + 0.05)\n\nAdding up: 99.3 + 29.79 = 129.09 + 4.965 = 134.055\n\nSo 1.35 * 99.3 = 134.055\n\nMale usage: 34.4% of 300 = 0.344 * 300 = 103.2\n\nDifference: |103.2 - 134.055| = 30.855\n\nSo the difference for 10th grade is 30.855, which is less than 36.27 for 9th grade.\n\nNext, 11th grade:\n\nMale usage: 20.6%\n\nFemale usage: 13.8%\n\nFemale usage: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300 = 41.4\n\n1.35 * 41.4 = ?\n\nCalculating 41.4 * 1.35:\n\n40 * 1.35 = 54\n\n1.4 * 1.35 = 1.89\n\nSo total is 54 + 1.89 = 55.89\n\nAlternatively, 41.4 * 1.35:\n\n41 * 1.35 = 55.35\n\n0.4 * 1.35 = 0.54\n\nTotal: 55.35 + 0.54 = 55.89\n\nMale usage: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300 = 61.8\n\nDifference: |61.8 - 55.89| = 5.91\n\nThat's a much smaller difference. So 11th grade has a difference of 5.91.\n\nNow, 12th grade:\n\nMale usage: 11.6%\n\nFemale usage: 8.6%\n\nFemale usage: 8.6% of 300 = 0.086 * 300 = 25.8\n\n1.35 * 25.8 = ?\n\n25 * 1.35 = 33.75\n\n0.8 * 1.35 = 1.08\n\nTotal: 33.75 + 1.08 = 34.83\n\nMale usage: 11.6% of 300 = 0.116 * 300 = 34.8\n\nDifference: |34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03\n\nWow, that's super close. So the difference is only 0.03.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- 9th grade: 36.27 difference\n\n- 10th grade: 30.855 difference\n\n- 11th grade: 5.91 difference\n\n- 12th grade: 0.03 difference\n\nSo the closest is the 12th grade with a difference of 0.03, followed by 11th grade with 5.91, then 10th grade, then 9th grade. Therefore, the answer should be 12th grade.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations for 12th grade to be sure.\n\nFemale usage in 12th grade: 8.6% of 300 is indeed 25.8.\n\n1.35 * 25.8: Let's compute again.\n\n25.8 * 1.35\n\nFirst, 25 * 1.35 = 33.75\n\n0.8 * 1.35 = 1.08\n\n33.75 + 1.08 = 34.83\n\nMale usage: 11.6% of 300 is 34.8. So 34.8 vs. 34.83. The difference is 0.03. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 0.03 is the smallest difference. Therefore, 12th grade is the answer.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check the other classes again.\n\nFor 11th grade:\n\nFemale usage: 13.8% of 300 = 41.4\n\n1.35 * 41.4 = 55.89\n\nMale usage: 20.6% of 300 = 61.8\n\nDifference: 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. Correct.\n\nFor 10th grade:\n\nFemale usage: 33.1% of 300 = 99.3\n\n1.35 * 99.3 = 134.055\n\nMale usage: 34.4% of 300 = 103.2\n\nDifference: 134.055 - 103.2 = 30.855. Correct.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n\nFemale usage: 39.4% of 300 = 118.2\n\n1.35 * 118.2 = 159.57\n\nMale usage: 41.1% of 300 = 123.3\n\nDifference: 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27. Correct.\n\nSo yes, 12th grade is the closest with a difference of 0.03. Therefore, the answer is 12th grade.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"procent liczb students korzystajacych z busa\". The translation is correct? \"Procent\" is percentage, \"liczb\" is number, \"students\" is students, \"korzystajacych\" is using the bus, \"z busa\" is of the bus. So the table shows the percentage of boys and girls in each class using the bus. Each class has 300 boys and 300 girls. So the numbers in the table are percentages. So for example, in 9th grade, 41.1% of the 300 boys use the bus, which is 0.411*300=123.3, and 39.4% of 300 girls use the bus, which is 118.2. Then, 135% of the girls using the bus would be 1.35*118.2=159.57. The difference between the boys using the bus (123.3) and this value is 36.27. Similarly for others. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the class where the number of male students using the bus is closest to 135% of the number of female students using the bus is 12th grade. So the answer is the 12th grade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ klasa}}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which class has the number of male students using the bus closest to 135% of the number of female students using the bus, we need to calculate 135% of the female usage and compare it to the male usage for each class. Each class has 300 men and 300 women.\n\n**Calculations for each class:**\n\n- **9th Grade:**\n  - Male usage: \\(41.1\\% \\times 300 = 123.3\\)\n  - Female usage: \\(39.4\\% \\times 300 = 118.2\\)\n  - 135% of female usage: \\(1.35 \\times 118.2 = 159.57\\)\n  - Difference: \\(|123.3 - 159.57| = 36.27\\)\n\n- **10th Grade:**\n  - Male usage: \\(34.4\\% \\times 300 = 103.2\\)\n  - Female usage: \\(33.1\\% \\times 300 = 99.3\\)\n  - 135% of female usage: \\(1.35 \\times 99.3 = 134.055\\)\n  - Difference: \\(|103.2 - 134.055| = 30.855\\)\n\n- **11th Grade:**\n  - Male usage: \\(20.6\\% \\times 300 = 61.8\\)\n  - Female usage: \\(13.8\\% \\times 300 = 41.4\\)\n  - 135% of female usage: \\(1.35 \\times 41.4 = 55.89\\)\n  - Difference: \\(|61.8 - 55.89| = 5.91\\)\n\n- **12th Grade:**\n  - Male usage: \\(11.6\\% \\times 300 = 34.8\\)\n  - Female usage: \\(8.6\\% \\times 300 = 25.8\\)\n  - 135% of female usage: \\(1.35 \\times 25.8 = 34.83\\)\n  - Difference: \\(|34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03\\)\n\nThe smallest difference is found in the 12th grade, where the difference is 0.03. Therefore, the class with the number of male students using the bus closest to 135% of the number of female students using the bus is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{", "answer": "12"}
{"original_question": "Rozwiąż\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "question": "Rozwiąż\n\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\\]", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the inequality \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that for a fraction to be less than zero, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. So, either the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or vice versa. But before I get into that, I should also note the domain of the inequality. The denominator can't be zero, so \\(x^2 - 36x \\neq 0\\). Let me factor that: \\(x(x - 36)\\), so the denominator is zero when \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 36\\). Therefore, \\(x\\) can't be 0 or 36. Got that.\n\nNow, the numerator is \\(|x^2 - 81|\\). Since it's an absolute value, the numerator is always non-negative. The absolute value is always greater than or equal to zero. So, the numerator can be zero or positive, but the denominator, as we saw, cannot be zero. But since the inequality is strict (< 0), the fraction must be negative. But the numerator is non-negative. So, the only way the fraction is negative is if the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative. Because if the numerator were zero, the fraction would be zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the numerator must be positive and the denominator must be negative.\n\nSo, we can split this into two conditions:\n\n1. \\(|x^2 - 81| > 0\\)\n2. \\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\)\n\nLet me handle these one by one.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \\(|x^2 - 81| > 0\\). The absolute value is greater than zero when the inside is not equal to zero. So, \\(x^2 - 81 \\neq 0\\), which implies \\(x \\neq 9\\) and \\(x \\neq -9\\). So, the first condition tells us that \\(x\\) can't be 9 or -9.\n\nNow, the second condition: \\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\). Let's factor this: \\(x(x - 36) < 0\\). To solve this inequality, we can analyze the sign of each factor. The critical points are at x = 0 and x = 36. So, we can create a sign chart:\n\n- For \\(x < 0\\): Let's pick x = -1. Then, \\(x = -1\\) is negative, and \\(x - 36 = -37\\) is also negative. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive. So, the expression is positive here.\n- For \\(0 < x < 36\\): Let's pick x = 1. Then, \\(x = 1\\) is positive, and \\(x - 36 = -35\\) is negative. Multiplying a positive and a negative gives a negative. So, the expression is negative here.\n- For \\(x > 36\\): Let's pick x = 37. Then, \\(x = 37\\) is positive, and \\(x - 36 = 1\\) is positive. Multiplying two positives gives a positive. So, the expression is positive here.\n\nTherefore, \\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\) when \\(0 < x < 36\\). But we also need to remember that \\(x\\) can't be 0 or 36 because those make the denominator zero, which is already excluded.\n\nSo, combining the two conditions:\n\n1. \\(x \\neq 9\\), \\(x \\neq -9\\)\n2. \\(0 < x < 36\\), \\(x \\neq 0\\), \\(x \\neq 36\\)\n\nBut wait, the second condition already excludes x = 0 and x = 36. So, the second condition simplifies to \\(0 < x < 36\\). However, we also have the first condition that \\(x \\neq 9\\) and \\(x \\neq -9\\). But in the interval \\(0 < x < 36\\), x = -9 is not included anyway because x is positive. So, the only restriction from the first condition is x ≠ 9. Therefore, combining these, the solution set is \\(0 < x < 36\\) excluding x = 9.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The first condition is \\(|x^2 - 81| > 0\\), which means x ≠ 9 and x ≠ -9. But in the interval 0 < x < 36, x can't be 9 because x = 9 is within that interval. So, we have to exclude x = 9.\n\nTherefore, the solution is \\(0 < x < 36\\) and x ≠ 9. So, in interval notation, that would be \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\nBut let me verify this with some test points to make sure.\n\nTake x = 1 (in (0,9)): numerator is |1 -81| = 80, denominator is 1 -36 = -35. So, 80/-35 = -16/7 < 0. Good.\n\nTake x = 20 (in (9,36)): numerator is |400 -81| = 319, denominator is 400 -720 = -320. So, 319/-320 ≈ -0.996 < 0. Still good.\n\nTake x = 9: denominator is 81 - 324 = -243, numerator is |81 -81| = 0. So, 0/-243 = 0, which is not less than zero. So, x=9 is excluded, correct.\n\nTake x = 0.5: numerator is |0.25 -81| = 80.75, denominator is 0.25 -18 = -17.75. So, 80.75/-17.75 ≈ -4.54 <0. Correct.\n\nTake x = 36: denominator is 1296 - 1296 = 0, which is excluded.\n\nTake x = -9: denominator is 81 - (-324) = 405, numerator is 0. So, 0/405 =0, which is not less than zero. So, x=-9 is excluded.\n\nSo, all the excluded points are correctly excluded. The intervals between 0 and 36, excluding 9, satisfy the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the solution is \\(0 < x < 36\\) with x ≠ 9, which in interval notation is \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the inequality is \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\), we need to determine when the fraction is negative. \n\n1. **Numerator Analysis**: The numerator \\(|x^2 - 81|\\) is always non-negative. For the fraction to be negative, the numerator must be positive and the denominator must be negative. The numerator is positive when \\(x^2 - 81 \\neq 0\\), i.e., \\(x \\neq 9\\) and \\(x \\neq -9\\).\n\n2. **Denominator Analysis**: The denominator \\(x^2 - 36x\\) factors to \\(x(x - 36)\\). This expression is negative when \\(0 < x < 36\\), excluding \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\) (which make the denominator zero).\n\nCombining these conditions:\n- The numerator is positive for \\(x \\neq 9\\) and \\(x \\neq -9\\).\n- The denominator is negative for \\(0 < x < 36\\).\n\nSince \\(x = 9\\) is within the interval \\(0 < x < 36\\), we must exclude it. The value \\(x = -9\\) is not in the interval \\(0 < x < 36\\).\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is the interval \\(0 < x < 36\\) excluding \\(x = 9\\), which in interval notation is \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}\n\\]", "answer": "(0,9) \\cup (9,36)"}

So, there's a rectangular field, and around it, there's a running track made up of two edges of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the maximum possible area of the field.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. The Asymptote code shows a rectangle with two semicircles on the top and bottom edges. So the track consists of the top and bottom sides of the rectangle and the two semicircles, which together form a full circle. Wait, no, each semicircle is on a side. So if the rectangle has length L and width W, then the track would have two straight parts each of length L (the top and bottom) and two semicircles with diameter W (the width of the rectangle). But wait, if the semicircles are on the width, then their radius would be W/2. So the circumference of each semicircle is π*(W/2). But since there are two semicircles, they make a full circle. So the total length of the track is 2*L + 2*(π*(W/2)) = 2L + πW. And this total is given as 400 meters.\n\nSo the equation would be 2L + πW = 400. We need to maximize the area A = L*W.\n\nTherefore, we need to express A in terms of one variable and then find its maximum. Let's solve for L from the equation 2L + πW = 400. So 2L = 400 - πW, which gives L = (400 - πW)/2. Then the area A = L*W = [(400 - πW)/2] * W = (400W - πW²)/2.\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can treat this as a quadratic function in terms of W. The quadratic is A = (-π/2)W² + 200W. Since the coefficient of W² is negative, the parabola opens downward, so the maximum occurs at the vertex.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by A = aW² + bW + c is at W = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -π/2 and b = 200. So W = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π.\n\nThen, substituting back into the equation for L: L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is A = L*W = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977 square meters.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me verify the track length. The track is the two straight sides (length L each) and the two semicircular ends. Each semicircle has a diameter of W, so circumference π*(W/2)*2 = πW. Wait, no. Wait, the circumference of a semicircle is π*r + 2r? Wait, no, the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, so a semicircle is πr + 2r? Wait, no. Wait, if you have a semicircle, the curved part is πr, and the straight part is 2r. But in this case, the track includes the straight parts (the top and bottom of the rectangle) and the two semicircular parts. Wait, the Asymptote code draws the top and bottom as straight lines and the two semicircles on the sides. Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again.\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\nfilldraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,2)--(0,2)--cycle,lightgreen); So that's the rectangle with length 3 and width 2. Then draw((0,0)--(3,0),linewidth(2bp)); the bottom. Then draw((0,2)--(3,2),linewidth(2bp)); the top. Then draw(arc((3,1),1,-90,90),linewidth(2bp)); which is a semicircle on the right side, centered at (3,1) with radius 1, from -90 to 90 degrees, so that's a semicircle going up. Similarly, draw(arc((0,1),1,90,270),linewidth(2bp)); which is a semicircle on the left side, centered at (0,1), radius 1, from 90 to 270 degrees, so a semicircle going down. So the track consists of the top and bottom sides (length 3 each) and the two semicircles (each with diameter 1). So the total track length is 2*3 + 2*(π*1/2) = 6 + π ≈ 6 + 3.1416 ≈ 9.1416. But in the problem, the track is 400 meters. So in the example, with length 3 and width 2, the track length is 6 + π*2/2 = 6 + π*1 = 6 + 3.1416 ≈ 9.1416. Wait, no. Wait, the semicircles are on the width. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the semicircles have radius 1, which is half the width (since the rectangle's width is 2). So the radius is W/2. Therefore, the circumference of each semicircle is π*(W/2). But since there are two semicircles, total curved length is π*(W/2)*2 = πW. Then the total track length is 2L + πW. So in the example, L=3, W=2, track length is 2*3 + π*2 ≈ 6 + 6.283 ≈ 12.283, but the Asymptote code's track length is 6 + π ≈ 9.1416. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code's track is different. Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, the track is the perimeter of the shape, which is the rectangle with the two semicircles. So the perimeter is the two straight sides (top and bottom) plus the two semicircles. Each semicircle has diameter equal to the width of the rectangle. So if the rectangle has width W, then each semicircle has diameter W, so radius W/2. The circumference of a full circle would be 2π*(W/2) = πW, so a semicircle would be π*(W/2). But since there are two semicircles, their total length is 2*(π*(W/2)) = πW. Then the total perimeter is 2L + πW. So that's correct. Therefore, the formula 2L + πW = 400 is correct.\n\nSo going back, if we express L in terms of W: L = (400 - πW)/2. Then area A = L*W = (400 - πW)/2 * W = (400W - πW²)/2. To maximize A, take derivative with respect to W and set to zero.\n\ndA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2. Setting to zero: 400 - 2πW = 0 => W = 400/(2π) = 200/π ≈ 63.66 meters. Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100 meters. So area is 100*(200/π) = 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the track length is indeed 2L + πW. So two straight sides of length L each, and two semicircular ends with circumference πW. So total track length is 2L + πW. Yes. So 2L + πW = 400. Then the area is L*W. So substituting L = (400 - πW)/2, then A = [(400 - πW)/2] * W = (400W - πW²)/2. Taking derivative: A’ = (400 - 2πW)/2. Setting to zero gives W = 200/π. Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100. So the maximum area is 100*(200/π) = 20000/π. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, perhaps there is another way to model the track. For example, sometimes tracks have straightaways and curves, but maybe in this case, the track is only the two straight sides and the two semicircles. So the total length is the sum of the two straight parts and the two semicircles. So yeah, 2L + πW = 400. Therefore, the answer should be 20000/π. Which is approximately 6366.1977, but since the question asks for the answer in terms of a box, probably as 20000/π, but maybe they want it in some other form? Wait, the problem says \"最大的 possible powierzhenia pola\", which is area in Polish, so square meters. So the answer is 20000/π, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the track. Let me check again. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle with length 3 and width 2, then two semicircles on the top and bottom. Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing the top and bottom as straight lines, and the two semicircles on the left and right sides. So the track is the perimeter of the shape, which is a rectangle with width 2 and length 3, with two semicircular ends on the left and right, each with diameter 2. So the circumference of each semicircle is π*(2)/2 = π. So two semicircles would total 2π. The two straight parts (top and bottom) would each be length 3, so total 6. So total track length is 6 + 2π ≈ 6 + 6.283 ≈ 12.283. But in the problem statement, the track is 400 meters. So in the problem, the track is 2L + πW = 400. So in the Asymptote example, W=2, L=3, track length 2*3 + π*2 ≈ 6 + 6.283 ≈ 12.283. So the formula is correct. Therefore, in the problem, we have 2L + πW = 400, and need to maximize L*W. Which gives the answer 20000/π. So I think that is correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider if we have a different shape. Suppose the track was a full circle, but no, in this case, it's two straight sides and two semicircles, forming a rectangle with semicircular ends. So it's not a full circle, but a shape like a capsule. So the formula 2L + πW is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we model the track as a rectangle with a semicircle on each end, then the perimeter is 2L + πW. So yes, that's the correct formula. Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π. So the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest possible area of the field is \\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}} square meters.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field surrounded by a running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular ends, with a total length of 400 meters. \n\n1. **Understanding the Track Length**:\n   - The track includes two straight sides (each of length \\( L \\)) and two semicircular ends.\n   - The circumference of each semicircle is \\( \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\).

The Asymptote code shows that it's a right-angled triangle at S, with a right angle mark between R-S-T. The length given is 5, which is probably the hypotenuse since it's labeled between points R and T. The question is asking for the value of sin T. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Since there's a right angle at S, the sides adjacent to S are the legs, and the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. The Asymptote code labels point T at (0,0), S at (2,0), and R at (2, sqrt(21)). So, plotting these points, T is at the origin, S is two units to the right, and R is two units to the right and sqrt(21) units up. The hypotenuse would then be from R to T, which is the side opposite the right angle at S.\n\nWait, but the hypotenuse is given as 5 in the problem. Let me check if that matches the coordinates. The coordinates of R are (2, sqrt(21)), and T is (0,0). So, the distance between R and T should be sqrt[(2-0)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 21] = sqrt[25] = 5. Okay, that makes sense. So, the hypotenuse RT is indeed 5 units long. Good, that checks out.\n\nNow, the problem states that sin R = 2/5. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So, sin R would be the side opposite angle R divided by the hypotenuse. But wait, angle R is at point R, which is (2, sqrt(21)). Let me think about the sides.\n\nIn triangle RST, the right angle is at S. So, angle R is one of the acute angles. The sides adjacent to angle R are the legs of the triangle. Let me label the sides:\n\n- Hypotenuse: RT = 5\n- Opposite to angle R: ST\n- Adjacent to angle R: RS\n\nWait, angle R is at point R. So, the sides at point R are RT and RS. The hypotenuse is RT, so the side opposite angle R is ST. Therefore, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST / RT = ST / 5. The problem says sin R = 2/5, so that would mean ST = 2. Let me confirm this.\n\nFrom the coordinates, point S is at (2,0) and point T is at (0,0), so the distance ST is sqrt[(2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 0] = 2. Yep, that's correct. So ST is 2 units, which makes sin R = 2/5 as given. That checks out.\n\nNow, the question is asking for sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the right angle vertex. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, one of the angles is 90 degrees, and the other two are acute. But angle T is at the right angle, so sin T would be sin 90 degrees, which is 1. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, the right angle is marked between R-S-T, which is at point S. So, the right angle is at S. Therefore, angles at R and T are the other two angles. So angle T is not the right angle; it's one of the acute angles. Therefore, sin T is the sine of an acute angle in a right-angled triangle. That was my mistake earlier. I thought the right angle was at T, but according to the Asymptote code, it's at S.\n\nSo, angle T is at point T, which is the origin (0,0). Let's see. In triangle RST, with right angle at S, points are T(0,0), S(2,0), R(2, sqrt(21)). So, angle T is at (0,0). Let's figure out the sides related to angle T.\n\nIn angle T, the sides adjacent to T are TS and TR. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the sides adjacent to the non-right angles are the legs. Wait, angle T is at point T, which is connected to points S and R. So, the sides at angle T are TS and TR. Wait, but TS is along the x-axis from T(0,0) to S(2,0), so that's length 2. TR is from T(0,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)), which is the hypotenuse, length 5. Wait, but TR is the hypotenuse, so the legs are TS and SR.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the sides. Let's list all sides:\n\n- TS: from T(0,0) to S(2,0), length 2.\n- SR: from S(2,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)), which is vertical, so length sqrt(21).\n- RT: from R(2, sqrt(21)) to T(0,0), length 5 (hypotenuse).\n\nSo, in triangle RST, right-angled at S, the legs are TS = 2 and SR = sqrt(21), hypotenuse RT = 5.\n\nTherefore, angle at T is angle T, which is at point T(0,0). To find sin T, we need the opposite side to angle T over the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is RT = 5. The side opposite angle T is SR, which is sqrt(21). Because in angle T, the sides adjacent are TS and RT, and the side opposite is SR.\n\nWait, let me confirm. In a triangle, the side opposite an angle is the one that doesn't form the angle. So, angle T is at point T, so the sides connected to T are TS and TR. The side that is not connected to T is SR. Therefore, the side opposite angle T is SR. Therefore, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = SR / RT = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives sin R = 2/5. Let me check if that matches. For angle R, the side opposite is ST = 2, hypotenuse RT =5, so sin R = 2/5. Correct. Then angle T, the side opposite is SR = sqrt(21), hypotenuse is 5, so sin T = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(21)/5. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side. Since we have a right-angled triangle at S, the legs are TS = 2 and SR = sqrt(21), hypotenuse RT =5. So, yes, that's consistent because 2^2 + (sqrt(21))^2 = 4 +21=25=5^2. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Since in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary. So, angle R + angle T = 90 degrees. Therefore, sin T = cos R. Alternatively, since angle T is complementary to angle R, sin T = cos R. So, if we can find cos R, that would be sin T.\n\nGiven that sin R = 2/5, then cos R = sqrt(1 - sin^2 R) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, sin T = cos R = sqrt(21)/5. That's another way to confirm it.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the value of sin T is sqrt(21)/5. Let me check once more to ensure there's no confusion with the triangle's labeling.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: In triangle RST, right-angled at S. So, angle at S is 90 degrees. Then angles at R and T are acute angles. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180, so angle R + angle T = 90 degrees. Therefore, sin T = cos R. Since sin R = 2/5, cos R = sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. That's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the sides: For angle T, the opposite side is SR = sqrt(21), hypotenuse is RT=5, so sin T = sqrt(21)/5. Yep, that's the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be sqrt(21)/5. Let me make sure there are no calculation errors. The hypotenuse is 5, given. The side opposite angle T is sqrt(21), which comes from the coordinates: from T(0,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)), the vertical distance is sqrt(21). So, yes. Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nI think that's correct. The key was recognizing that angle T is not the right angle, so it's an acute angle in the right-angled triangle, and using either the side ratio or the co-function identity (since angle T is complementary to angle R) to find sin T.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\sin{T}$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right-angled triangle \\( \\triangle RST \\) with a right angle at \\( S \\), we know the following:\n- The hypotenuse \\( RT \\) is 5 units.\n- \\( \\sin{R} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nFirst, we confirm the sides of the triangle:\n- The side opposite to \\( \\angle R \\) (which is \\( ST \\)) is 2 units, confirming \\( \\sin{R} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n- The side adjacent to \\( \\angle R \\) (which is \\( RS \\)) is \\( \\sqrt{21} \\) units, as calculated from the coordinates of \\( R \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nSince \\( \\triangle RST \\) is a right-angled triangle at \\( S \\), the angles \\( \\angle R \\) and \\( \\angle T \\) are complementary.

Then express that distance as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers with a square-free (meaning it's not divisible by any square number larger than 1). Finally, I have to find a + b. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the distance from the origin (0,0) to any point (x, y) is given by the formula sqrt(x² + y²). Since we want the smallest such distance, we need to minimize this expression. However, working with square roots can be a bit messy, so maybe I can instead minimize the square of the distance, which should give the same result. That is, minimize x² + y².\n\nGiven that the point (x, y) lies on the graph y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute this expression for y into the distance squared formula. Let me write that out:\n\nDistance squared = x² + y² = x² + [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]²\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, expand the y squared term:\n\n[ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nSo the distance squared becomes:\n\nx² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum of this function with respect to x. Let's denote f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)². To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then check if it's a minimum using the second derivative or some other method.\n\nLet's compute the derivative f'(x):\n\nFirst, the derivative of x² is 2x.\n\nSecond, the derivative of (1/2)(x² - 3)² is (1/2)*2*(x² - 3)*(2x) by the chain rule. Wait, let me verify that:\n\nThe derivative of (x² - 3)² is 2(x² - 3)*(2x), right? Because d/dx (u²) = 2u*u', where u = x² - 3, so u' = 2x. So that's 2(x² - 3)*2x = 4x(x² - 3). Then multiply by the 1/2 in front:\n\n(1/2)*4x(x² - 3) = 2x(x² - 3)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 2x(x² - 3)\n\nLet me factor out 2x:\n\nf'(x) = 2x[1 + (x² - 3)] = 2x(x² - 3 + 1) = 2x(x² - 2)\n\nWait, that seems right. Let's check:\n\nOriginal f'(x) = 2x + 2x(x² - 3) = 2x + 2x³ - 6x = 2x³ - 4x. Alternatively, factoring 2x gives 2x(x² - 2). Yes, because 2x³ - 4x = 2x(x² - 2). So either way, same result.\n\nSo f'(x) = 2x(x² - 2). To find critical points, set this equal to zero:\n\n2x(x² - 2) = 0\n\nSolutions are x = 0 or x² - 2 = 0, so x = ±√2.\n\nTherefore, critical points at x = 0, x = √2, x = -√2.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these gives the minimum distance. Let's evaluate f(x) at each critical point.\n\nFirst, x = 0:\n\nf(0) = 0² + (1/2)(0² - 3)² = 0 + (1/2)(9) = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nNext, x = √2:\n\nf(√2) = (√2)² + (1/2)( (√2)² - 3 )²\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(√2)² = 2\n\n(√2)² - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1\n\nSo ( -1 )² = 1\n\nThus, f(√2) = 2 + (1/2)(1) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5\n\nSimilarly, x = -√2 will give the same result because x is squared, so (-√2)² is also 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs at x = ±√2, with f(x) = 2.5, which is 5/2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2, since sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nNow, check if a = 10 and b = 2 satisfy the conditions. a must be square-free. 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which are squares, so yes, 10 is square-free. b = 2 is an integer. Therefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but before finalizing, let me verify if there are any other critical points or if I made a computational mistake.\n\nWait, the critical points were x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). Evaluating f(x) at these points, indeed x = sqrt(2) gives the minimal value. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum. Let's compute f''(x):\n\nWe have f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x, so f''(x) = 6x² - 4.\n\nAt x = sqrt(2), f''(sqrt(2)) = 6*(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0, so it's a local minimum. Similarly at x = -sqrt(2), same. At x = 0, f''(0) = -4 < 0, so local maximum. Therefore, the minimal distance is indeed at x = ±sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, so a = 10, b = 2, a + b = 12. Seems correct.\n\nBut let me just verify once again by plugging in the coordinates. If x = sqrt(2), then y = (1/√2)( (sqrt(2))² - 3 ) = (1/√2)(2 - 3) = (1/√2)(-1) = -1/√2. So the point is (sqrt(2), -1/√2). Then the distance from the origin is sqrt( (sqrt(2))² + (-1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + (1/2)) = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't make a mistake in substitution, but let me check:\n\nGiven y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So when x = sqrt(2), x² = 2, so y = (1/√2)(2 - 3) = (1/√2)(-1) = -1/√2. Then x² + y² = 2 + (1/2) = 5/2. So sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 + 2 = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest distance from the origin to a point on the graph \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we need to minimize the distance squared function \\( f(x) = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nFirst, simplify the distance squared function:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nNext, compute the derivative \\( f'(x) \\):\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x + 2x(x^2 - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x + 2x^3 - 6x\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2)\n\\]\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\\[\n2x(x^2 - 2) = 0\n\\]\nThe critical points are \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\), and \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nEvaluate the function \\( f(x) \\) at these critical points:\n- For \\( x = 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(0) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}(0 - 3)^2 = \\frac{9}{2}\n  \\]\n- For \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\):\n  \\[\n  f(\\sqrt{2}) = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}((\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}(2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n- For \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\):\n  \\[\n  f(-\\sqrt{2}) = (-\\sqrt{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}((-\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n\nThe minimum value is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\), so the minimum distance is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} \\).\n\nThus, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\), and the sum \\( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]", "answer": "12"}

Solving for x gives x = 3. Since x = 3 is indeed ≤ 3, that's a valid solution. So one solution is x = 3.\n\nSecond equation: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0 for x > 3. Let's factor this equation. Factor out an x: x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. So either x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0. But since we're looking for x > 3, x = 0 is not in this domain. So focus on -x² + 2x + 3 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: x² - 2x - 3 = 0. Factor this quadratic: (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. So solutions are x = 3 and x = -1. But again, x > 3 is required here, so neither x = 3 nor x = -1 are in the domain x > 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval. So the only solution for f(x) = 0 is x = 3. Therefore, f^{-1}(0) = 3.\n\nNow moving on to f^{-1}(6). So we need to solve f(x) = 6. Again, check both pieces of the function.\n\nFirst, check x ≤ 3: 3 - x = 6. Solving for x: -x = 6 - 3 = 3, so x = -3. Since -3 ≤ 3, this is a valid solution. So x = -3 is one solution.\n\nSecond, check x > 3: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Let's set up the equation: -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0. Now, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe use rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.\n\nTest x = 1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0.\n\nx = 2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, x=2 is a root. So (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nDivide x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 by (x - 2):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  -2  -3  6\n\n          2   0  -6\n\n      1   0   -3  0\n\nSo the quotient is x² + 0x - 3, which is x² - 3. Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0. So the roots are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), and x = -sqrt(3). But we are looking for x > 3. The roots here are 2, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, and -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732. None of these are greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in the interval x > 3. Thus, the only solution is x = -3. Therefore, f^{-1}(6) = -3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if x = -3 is indeed mapped to 6. Let's plug back into f(x). For x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - (-3) = 3 + 3 = 6. Yes, that's correct. So f(-3) = 6. So f^{-1}(6) is indeed -3. So then f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. Hmm. Is that possible? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for f^{-1}(0), we found x = 3. Because 3 - 3 = 0. Then f^{-1}(6) is x = -3. So adding them gives 0. That seems correct. But let me confirm once more.\n\nFor f^{-1}(0): solving 3 - x = 0 gives x = 3. For x > 3, the equation -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0 had no solutions. So yes, only x = 3. For f^{-1}(6): solving 3 - x = 6 gives x = -3, which is valid. For x > 3, solving -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6 gives x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0, which factors to (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0. But no roots in x > 3. So yes, x = -3 is the only solution. Therefore, 3 + (-3) = 0. So the answer is 0. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible solutions.\n\nFor f^{-1}(0): could there be another x > 3 where f(x) = 0? The equation -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0 for x > 3. We found x = 3 and x = -1, but neither are in the domain x > 3. So no. So only x = 3.\n\nFor f^{-1}(6): solving 3 - x = 6 gives x = -3. For x > 3, solving -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. We factored and found x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3), none of which are greater than 3. So no solutions there. Thus, only x = -3. So sum is 3 + (-3) = 0. So the answer is 0. Seems right. I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 6 \\), then sum the solutions.\n\n1. **Solving \\( f(x) = 0 \\):**\n   - For \\( x \\leq 3 \\), \\( f(x) = 3 - x \\).

The distances from a point P to five of its vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by recalling what a regular octahedron is. It's a Platonic solid with eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. Each face is an equilateral triangle, and all edges are of equal length. The octahedron can be thought of as two square pyramids glued together at their bases. \n\nLooking at the Asymptote code provided, they've drawn the octahedron with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F. The coordinates given in the code might be helpful. Let me parse that. The points are:\n\n- A = (1,0,0)\n- B = (-1,0,0)\n- C = (0,1,0)\n- D = (0,-1,0)\n- E = (0,0,1)\n- F = (0,0,-1)\n\nAnd point P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). The code draws lines from P to each of the vertices A-F, and some edges are drawn in red. The rest are dashed. The figure is viewed in perspective, so the drawing is a bit challenging, but maybe the coordinates can help.\n\nFirst, since it's a regular octahedron, all edges are equal. Let's check the distance between A and C. The coordinates are (1,0,0) and (0,1,0). The distance is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 0) = sqrt(2). Similarly, between A and E: (1,0,0) to (0,0,1). Distance is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So all edges are indeed sqrt(2), but since the problem mentions it's a regular octahedron, the edge length must be uniform. However, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are set such that edges are length sqrt(2). Wait, but maybe the actual edge length is 1? Wait, no. If the coordinates are like that, the distance between adjacent vertices (along the axes) is 1 unit along each axis, but the edges are between those. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, for example, the distance between A (1,0,0) and C (0,1,0) is sqrt(2), which is the edge length. Similarly, A and E are sqrt(2). So the edge length is sqrt(2). But the coordinates might be scaled for the figure. Maybe in the problem, the edge length is considered as 1? But according to the coordinates given, edges are sqrt(2). Hmm. Maybe the Asymptote code is just a stylized drawing, not to scale. The problem might not require knowledge of the exact coordinates but rather properties of the octahedron.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the regular octahedron with coordinates. Let's consider the standard regular octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). Then edges are between these points. Each vertex is connected to four others. For example, (1,0,0) is connected to (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,-1). So, in this case, the edge length is sqrt(2), as the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is sqrt(2). So if the problem uses this standard octahedron, then edges are sqrt(2). However, in the Asymptote code, point P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Let me check the distances from P to the vertices.\n\nWait, maybe the coordinates in the Asymptote code are not the standard ones. Let me calculate the distances from P to each vertex:\n\n- Distance to A (1,0,0): sqrt((1.2 - 1)^2 + (1.5 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 2.25 + 1) = sqrt(3.29) ≈ 1.814\n- Distance to B (-1,0,0): sqrt((-1 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt((-2.2)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4.84 + 2.25 + 1) = sqrt(8.09) ≈ 2.844\n- Distance to C (0,1,0): sqrt((0 - 1.2)^2 + (1 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.25 + 1) = sqrt(2.69) ≈ 1.640\n- Distance to D (0,-1,0): sqrt((0 - 1.2)^2 + (-1 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 6.25 + 1) = sqrt(8.69) ≈ 2.948\n- Distance to E (0,0,1): sqrt((0 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 + (1 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 2.25 + 0) = sqrt(3.69) ≈ 1.921\n- Distance to F (0,0,-1): sqrt((0 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 + (-1 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 2.25 + 4) = sqrt(7.69) ≈ 2.773\n\nBut in the problem, the given distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. These are much larger than the distances in the Asymptote code (around 1.8 to 2.948). That suggests that perhaps the Asymptote code is just a stylized drawing for the figure, not to scale. So the actual problem is abstract, with a different scaling.\n\nTherefore, maybe we need to find a mathematical relationship that holds for any point inside a regular octahedron, regardless of its size. The key might be to use the property that in a regular octahedron, each vertex is connected to four others, and there's a certain symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a theorem related to distances from a point inside a regular polyhedron to its vertices. I remember that in a regular simplex (which is the generalization of a regular octahedron in higher dimensions), there's a relationship between the distances from a point to the vertices. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the regular octahedron. Let's consider the standard coordinates:\n\nVertices:\nA: (1, 0, 0)\nB: (-1, 0, 0)\nC: (0, 1, 0)\nD: (0, -1, 0)\nE: (0, 0, 1)\nF: (0, 0, -1)\n\nLet me denote point P as (x, y, z). The distances from P to each vertex are:\n\nPA = sqrt((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)\nPB = sqrt((x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)\nPC = sqrt(x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2)\nPD = sqrt(x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2)\nPE = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2)\nPF = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2)\n\nGiven that five of these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and we need to find the sixth.\n\nFirst, note that the regular octahedron is symmetric with respect to all coordinate planes. So, if we consider the coordinates of P, maybe there's some symmetry we can exploit. For example, if the distances to A and B are given, maybe we can relate them through x.\n\nLet me try squaring the distances to make them easier to handle. Let's denote:\n\nPA² = (x - 1)^2 + y² + z² = d₁²\n\nPB² = (x + 1)^2 + y² + z² = d₂²\n\nPC² = x² + (y - 1)^2 + z² = d₃²\n\nPD² = x² + (y + 1)^2 + z² = d₄²\n\nPE² = x² + y² + (z - 1)^2 = d₅²\n\nPF² = x² + y² + (z + 1)^2 = d₆²\n\nWhere d₁, d₂, d₃, d₄, d₅, d₆ are the distances from P to each vertex. The problem states that five of these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and we need to find the sixth.\n\nLet me consider the differences between PA² and PB²:\n\nPB² - PA² = [(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] + 0 + 0 = [x² + 2x + 1 - x² + 2x - 1] = 4x\n\nSimilarly, PD² - PC² = [(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] + [(y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2] = 4x + 4y\n\nWait, let me compute PD² - PC²:\n\nPD² = x² + (y + 1)^2 + z² = x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²\n\nPC² = x² + (y - 1)^2 + z² = x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²\n\nSo PD² - PC² = (x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²) - (x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²) = 4y\n\nSimilarly, PE² - PF² = [x² + y² + (z - 1)^2] - [x² + y² + (z + 1)^2] = (z² - 2z + 1) - (z² + 2z + 1) = -4z\n\nSo, we have:\n\nPB² - PA² = 4x\n\nPD² - PC² = 4y\n\nPE² - PF² = -4z\n\nTherefore, if we know PB² - PA², we can get x. Similarly for y and z.\n\nBut in the problem, we don't know which distances correspond to which vertex. The given distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, but we don't know which is PA, PB, etc. So maybe we need to consider different permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to all vertices can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of the point and the coordinates of the vertices.\n\nLet me compute the sum PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF².\n\nExpanding each:\n\nPA² = (x - 1)^2 + y² + z² = x² - 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\nPB² = (x + 1)^2 + y² + z² = x² + 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\nPC² = x² + (y - 1)^2 + z² = x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²\n\nPD² = x² + (y + 1)^2 + z² = x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²\n\nPE² = x² + y² + (z - 1)^2 = x² + y² + z² - 2z + 1\n\nPF² = x² + y² + (z + 1)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2z + 1\n\nAdding all these up:\n\nPA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF² = [ (x² - 2x + 1 + y² + z²) + (x² + 2x + 1 + y² + z²) + (x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²) + (x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²) + (x² + y² + z² - 2z + 1) + (x² + y² + z² + 2z + 1) ]\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\n1. x² - 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\n2. x² + 2x + 1 + y² + z²\n\n3. x² + y² - 2y + 1 + z²\n\n4. x² + y² + 2y + 1 + z²\n\n5. x² + y² + z² - 2z + 1\n\n6. x² + y² + z² + 2z + 1\n\nAdding all the x² terms: 6x²\n\nAdding all the y² terms: 6y²\n\nAdding all the z² terms: 6z²\n\nAdding the x terms: (-2x + 2x) = 0\n\nAdding the y terms: (-2y + 2y) = 0\n\nAdding the z terms: (-2z + 2z) = 0\n\nAdding the constants: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, the total sum is 6x² + 6y² + 6z² + 6 = 6(x² + y² + z² + 1)\n\nSo, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices", "answer": "\\sqrt{66}"}

Both are being hit by their respective players with the same force. Hmm, let's start by recalling Newton's second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration. The formula is F = m * a. \n\nThe problem says that both players are hitting their balls with the same force. So, the force applied to the softball is equal to the force applied to the baseball. Let me write that down:\n\nF_short = F_baseball\n\nUsing Newton's second law for each, we have:\n\nF_short = m_short * a_short\n\nF_baseball = m_baseball * a_baseball\n\nSince the forces are equal, we can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\nm_short * a_short = m_baseball * a_baseball\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of a_short to a_baseball. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio.\n\nDivide both sides by m_short and a_baseball:\n\n(a_short / a_baseball) = (m_baseball / m_short)\n\nSo, the ratio of accelerations is equal to the ratio of masses, but inverted because a = F/m. That makes sense because if the same force is applied to a lighter object, it will accelerate more. \n\nNow, plug in the given masses. The softball is 200 grams, and the baseball is 150 grams. So substituting:\n\n(a_short / a_baseball) = (150g / 200g)\n\nSimplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator have grams, which cancel out. So we have 150/200. Let's reduce that fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 50:\n\n150 ÷ 50 = 3\n\n200 ÷ 50 = 4\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 3/4. Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball is 3/4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the force is the same, then acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. So, since the softball is heavier (200g vs 150g), it should accelerate less. Therefore, the softball's acceleration divided by the baseball's acceleration should be less than 1, which 3/4 is. That checks out. \n\nAlternatively, using numbers: suppose the force is 1 N (just for calculation). For the softball, acceleration would be 1 N / 0.2 kg = 5 m/s². For the baseball, acceleration would be 1 N / 0.15 kg ≈ 6.666... m/s². Then the ratio is 5 / 6.666... ≈ 0.75, which is 3/4. Yep, that works. \n\nSo the answer should be 3/4.\n</think>\n\nThe ratio of the accelerations is determined by the inverse ratio of their masses since the applied force is the same.

So, I need to convert 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8, then compare the digits of these two numbers and count how many digits are the same in the same positions.

The user wrote: \"Na przykład, $121_{3}$ i $413_{5}$ miałyby одну commoną cyfrę.\" So maybe in their example, when converted to base 10, they have one digit matching. But 121 in base 3 is 13, 413 in base 5 is 108. There's no common digit in their digits. Wait, 1,2,1 vs 4,1,3. The second digit in the first is 2, and in the second is 1. So maybe they count the positions where the digits are the same when written in their respective bases. But 121 and 413 are different numbers. Hmm, maybe the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about digits in both representations, regardless of position? Like, how many digits are the same in either number. But the problem says \"w reprezentacjach liczby 629_{10} w systemie o pod_rgba 7 i pod買う 8\" – \"in the representations of the number 629 in base 10 in the systems of base 7 and base 8\". So, probably comparing the two representations (base 7 and base 8 of 629) and counting how many digits are the same in the same positions. So, first, I need to convert 629 to base 7 and base 8, write down the numbers, then compare digit by digit. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, converting 629 from base 10 to base 7.\n\nTo convert to base 7, we divide by 7 repeatedly and record the remainders.\n\n629 divided by 7: 7*89 = 623, remainder 6. So the least significant digit is 6.\n\n89 divided by 7: 7*12 = 84, remainder 5. Next digit is 5.\n\n12 divided by 7: 7*1 = 7, remainder 5. Next digit is 5.\n\n1 divided by 7: 0, remainder 1. Next digit is 1.\n\nSo writing the digits from last to first: 1, 5, 5, 6. So 629 in base 7 is 1556_7.\n\nWait, let me check: 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7 + 6 = 1*343 + 5*49 + 5*7 + 6 = 343 + 245 + 35 + 6 = 343 + 245 = 588, 588 +35=623, 623 +6=629. Correct.\n\nNow converting 629 to base 8.\n\nDivide by 8:\n\n629 /8 = 78.625, so integer part 78, remainder 629 -78*8=629 -624=5. So least significant digit is 5.\n\n78 /8=9.75, integer 9, remainder 78-9*8=78-72=6. Next digit 6.\n\n9 /8=1.125, integer 1, remainder 9-1*8=1. Next digit 1.\n\n1 /8=0.125, remainder 1. Next digit 1.\n\nSo writing from last to first: 1, 1, 6, 5. So 629 in base 8 is 1165_8.\n\nWait, check: 1*8^3 +1*8^2 +6*8 +5 = 512 +64 +48 +5 = 512+64=576, 576+48=624, 624+5=629. Correct.\n\nSo now, the two representations are:\n\nBase 7: 1 5 5 6 (1556_7)\n\nBase 8: 1 1 6 5 (1165_8)\n\nNow, we need to compare these two numbers digit by digit and count how many digits are the same in the same position.\n\nLet's line them up:\n\nBase 7: 1 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (units)\n\nBase 8: 1 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (units)\n\nComparing each digit:\n\n1st digit (thousands place): 1 vs 1 → same\n\n2nd digit (hundreds place): 5 vs 1 → different\n\n3rd digit (tens place): 5 vs 6 → different\n\n4th digit (units place): 6 vs 5 → different\n\nSo only the first digit is the same. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me verify the base 7 and base 8 conversions again.\n\nFor base 7:\n\n629 divided by 7: 7*89=623, remainder 6. That's correct.\n\n89 divided by 7: 7*12=84, remainder 5. Correct.\n\n12 divided by 7: 7*1=7, remainder 5. Correct.\n\n1 divided by 7: 0, remainder 1. Correct. So 1556_7 is correct.\n\nBase 8:\n\n629 divided by 8: 78*8=624, remainder 5. Correct.\n\n78 divided by 8: 9*8=72, remainder 6. Correct.\n\n9 divided by 8: 1*8=8, remainder 1. Correct.\n\n1 divided by 8: 0*8=0, remainder 1. Correct. So 1165_8 is correct.\n\nComparing digit by digit:\n\n1 (base7) vs 1 (base8) → same\n\n5 vs 1 → different\n\n5 vs 6 → different\n\n6 vs 5 → different\n\nSo only one common digit. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement's example had 121_3 and 413_5, but when converted to base 10, they were 13 and 108. However, they said those have one common digit. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check that again. If 121 in base3 is 13, and 413 in base5 is 108. The digits in 13 (base10) and 108 (base10) are different. But the example says they have one common digit. That must be a mistake in the example, or perhaps a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the example is about digits in the original base3 and base5 numbers, not their decimal equivalents. So 121 in base3 is '1','2','1', and 413 in base5 is '4','1','3'. Then, the digits '1' appears in the second position of base3 and the second position of base5, so that's one common digit. So maybe the problem counts the number of digits that are the same in the same position in their respective bases. So in that case, 121_3 and 413_5 would have one common digit. Therefore, in our problem, we need to compare the digits of the base7 and base8 representations of 629, which are 1556_7 and 1165_8, and count how many digits are the same in the same positions. So the answer is 1. So I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many same digits are in the representations of the number 629 in base 7 and base 8, we first convert 629 from base 10 to both bases.\n\n**Converting 629 to base 7:**\n1. \\( 629 \\div 7 = 89 \\) with remainder 6\n2. \\( 89 \\div 7 = 12 \\) with remainder 5\n3. \\( 12 \\div 7 = 1 \\) with remainder 5\n4. \\( 1 \\div 7 = 0 \\) with remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, we get \\( 1556_7 \\).\n\n**Converting 629 to base 8:**\n1. \\( 629 \\div 8 = 78 \\) with remainder 5\n2. \\( 78 \\div 8 = 9 \\) with remainder 6\n3. \\( 9 \\div 8 = 1 \\) with remainder 1\n4. \\( 1 \\div 8 = 0 \\) with remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, we get \\( 1165_8 \\).\n\n**Comparing the digits:**\n- Base 7: \\( 1556_7 \\)\n- Base 8: \\( 1165_8 \\)\n\nComparing digit by digit:\n1. The first digit (thousands place): \\( 1 \\) (same)\n2. The second digit (hundreds place): \\( 5 \\) vs \\( 1 \\) (different)\n3. The third digit (tens place): \\( 5 \\) vs \\( 6 \\) (different)\n4. The fourth digit (units place): \\( 6 \\) vs \\( 5 \\) (different)\n\nOnly the first digit is the same in both representations.\n\nThus, the number of common digits is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "3"}

Ile uścisków dłoni miało miejsce na spotkaniu?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So, there's this problem about six blacks and ten reds at a magic meeting. The blacks want to punch each of the reds. But there are some rules: no black will punch another black, and the reds don't punch each other either. The question is, how many total punchings (or uscikes, which are like the results of the punchings) happen at the meeting?\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, there are six blacks and ten reds. Each black has to punch each red. So, if each of the six blacks punches all ten reds, then the total number of punches would be 6 times 10. Let me calculate that: 6*10=60. But wait, the problem mentions something about \"uscikes of the wraths.\" Maybe that's a translation issue. The original probably was \"punches\" or something. But the key point is, we need to count the total number of times the blacks punch the reds.\n\nBut let's check the constraints again. The problem states that no black will punch another black, and the reds don't punch each other. So, the only punches happening are from blacks to reds. Since there are six blacks and each of them has to punch all ten reds, that should indeed be 6*10=60. But wait, maybe I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Żadna z czarownic не scrapрестa себе головy usciskami wraths z in(GET)ymi czarownicami...\" Translating that: \"No black has a head scrapered by the punches from otherczarownics, because all are already good friends, and the reds don't hate each other and don't punch each other either.\" So, this just confirms that blacks don't punch each other and reds don't punch each other. So, all the punches are one-way: blacks to reds, no reciprocation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of uscikes (punches) is indeed the number of blacks multiplied by the number of reds. So 6*10=60. Therefore, the answer should be 60.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"Sześć czarownic i dziesiąc uczarod mogę na magicznym spotkaniu.\" So, six blacks and ten reds. \"Czarownice postanили u斯cisся—if—d lóni z każdym z czarodže ova.\" So, each black punches every red. \"Żadna z czarownic не scrapъedva себе головy usciskami wraths z in(GE)Tymi czarownicami...\" So, they don't punch each other because they're all good friends. So, yeah, only blacks punch reds, reds don't punch anyone.\n\nTherefore, it's straightforward multiplication: 6 blacks * 10 reds = 60 punches. So, the number of uscikes of wraths is 60. Therefore, the answer is 60, which in boxed form is \\boxed{60}.\n\nBut wait, just to double-check. Let me think again. Each of the six blacks has to punch each of the ten reds. So, for each black, that's 10 punches. So, 6 blacks * 10 punches each = 60. Yep. And since the reds aren't punching anyone, and the blacks aren't punching each other, there's no double-counting or anything. So, 60 is the correct answer. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of uscikes of wraths (punches) at the magic meeting, we need to consider the interactions between the 6czarownics and 10czarodzes. \n\n- **Chestnuts' Bruce's rule**: Each of the 6czarownics must punch every 10czarodzes. Since there are no reciprocal punches (blacks don't punch each other, and reds don't punch each other), all punches are one-way from blacks to reds.\n  \n- Calculation: Multiply the number of blacks by the number of reds:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ czarownics} \\times 10 \\text{ czarodzes} = 60 \\text{ punches}.\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of uscikes of wraths on the spot is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).", "answer": "60"}

The original polynomial f(x) is given as 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. For example, if you have a polynomial like ax² + bx + c, the sum of the coefficients is a + b + c, which is equal to f(1). So maybe I can use this trick here.\n\nBut wait, g(x) is f(x-1), so I need to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x). That should be g(1), right? Because substituting x = 1 into g(x) gives the sum of its coefficients. Since g(x) = f(x-1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). Wait, is that correct?\n\nHold on, maybe I confused something here. Let me double-check. The sum of the coefficients of g(x) is indeed g(1). But since g(x) = f(x - 1), then substituting x = 1 into g gives f(1 - 1) = f(0). So actually, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is equal to f(0). That's interesting. So instead of expanding f(x - 1) and then adding up all the coefficients, I can just compute f(0). Let me verify this logic.\n\nSuppose f(x) is some polynomial, then g(x) = f(x - 1). The sum of the coefficients of g(x) is g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). Yes, that seems right. Because when you create g(x) by substituting (x - 1) into f(x), the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is the value of the polynomial g at x = 1, which is the same as f(0). Therefore, I just need to compute f(0).\n\nLet's compute f(0). The original polynomial is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Plugging in x = 0, all the terms with x will vanish. So 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2. Therefore, f(0) = -2. Hence, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. Let's try another approach. Maybe expand f(x - 1) and then add up all the coefficients. If that gives the same result, then my answer is correct.\n\nSo, let's compute f(x - 1). The original f(x) is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Substitute x with (x - 1):\n\nf(x - 1) = 3(x - 1)^4 + 5(x - 1)^2 - 9(x - 1) - 2.\n\nNow, let's expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 1)^4. The binomial expansion is:\n\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3x^4 - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.\n\nNext, expand 5(x - 1)^2. First, (x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5: 5x² - 10x + 5.\n\nThen, -9(x - 1) = -9x + 9.\n\nFinally, the last term is -2.\n\nNow, combine all these terms together:\n\n3x⁴ - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3 + 5x² - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x⁴ term: 3x⁴.\n\n- x³ term: -12x³.\n\n- x² terms: 18x² + 5x² = 23x².\n\n- x terms: -12x -10x -9x = -31x.\n\n- constants: 3 + 5 + 9 - 2 = 15.\n\nSo, g(x) = 3x⁴ - 12x³ + 23x² - 31x + 15.\n\nNow, sum of the coefficients is 3 + (-12) + 23 + (-31) + 15. Let's compute that:\n\n3 - 12 = -9\n\n-9 + 23 = 14\n\n14 - 31 = -17\n\n-17 + 15 = -2.\n\nSo, the sum is indeed -2. Therefore, both methods confirm that the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2. So the answer is \\boxed{-2}.\n\nBut just to ensure I didn't make any expansion errors, let me check the expansion again.\n\nFirst term: 3(x - 1)^4. As above, (x - 1)^4 = x^4 -4x³ +6x² -4x +1. Multiply by 3: 3x⁴ -12x³ +18x² -12x +3. Correct.\n\nSecond term: 5(x -1)^2 = 5x² -10x +5. Correct.\n\nThird term: -9(x -1) = -9x +9. Correct.\n\nFourth term: -2. Correct.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n3x⁴ -12x³ +18x² -12x +3 +5x² -10x +5 -9x +9 -2.\n\nCombine:\n\nx⁴: 3\n\nx³: -12\n\nx²: 18 +5 =23\n\nx terms: -12 -10 -9 = -31\n\nconstants: 3 +5 +9 -2 =15.

Hmm, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. Right, because the line of shortest distance is the one that is perpendicular to the given line. Let me try to recall how to compute that.\n\nFirst, the given line is in slope-intercept form, y = 2x - 2. So its slope is 2. The slope of the perpendicular line should be the negative reciprocal, which is -1/2. So, if I can find the equation of the line that passes through (6, 0) and has a slope of -1/2, then the intersection point of these two lines will be the closest point on the original line to (6, 0). Once I have that intersection point, I can calculate the distance between (6, 0) and that point.\n\nLet me write down the equations. The original line is y = 2x - 2. The perpendicular line passing through (6, 0) will have the equation y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6), which simplifies to y = (-1/2)x + 3.\n\nNow, to find the intersection point, I need to solve the system of equations:\n\n1. y = 2x - 2\n2. y = (-1/2)x + 3\n\nSet them equal to each other:\n\n2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3\n\nLet me solve for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4x - 4 = -x + 6\n\nNow, add x to both sides:\n\n5x - 4 = 6\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n5x = 10\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nx = 2\n\nNow substitute x = 2 back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the first one:\n\ny = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nSo the intersection point is (2, 2). Now, I need to find the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2). Using the distance formula:\n\nDistance = √[(6 - 2)² + (0 - 2)²] = √[(4)² + (-2)²] = √[16 + 4] = √20\n\nSimplify √20. Since 20 = 4*5, and √4 = 2, so √20 = 2√5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the distance from a point to a line that I can use without finding the intersection point. I think the formula is |Ax + By + C| / √(A² + B²) if the line is written in Ax + By + C = 0 form.\n\nLet me try that method as a verification. The original line is y = 2x - 2. Let's rearrange it to standard form:\n\n2x - y - 2 = 0\n\nSo A = 2, B = -1, C = -2.\n\nThe point is (6, 0). Plugging into the formula:\n\n|2*6 + (-1)*0 - 2| / √(2² + (-1)²) = |12 - 0 - 2| / √(4 + 1) = |10| / √5 = 10/√5 = 2√5\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So both methods give me 2√5, which is approximately 4.472. That seems reasonable.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. The coordinates of the intersection point: solving 2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3. Multiply both sides by 2: 4x - 4 = -x + 6. Then 4x + x = 6 + 4 => 5x = 10 => x = 2. Then y = 2*2 - 2 = 2. Correct. Then distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 2*6 -1*0 -2 = 10. Absolute value is 10. Divide by sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So 10/sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance is 2√5. So the answer should be boxed as \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe shortest distance is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the point \\((6, 0)\\) to the line \\(y = 2x - 2\\), we need to determine the perpendicular distance. \n\nFirst, we recognize that the slope of the given line \\(y = 2x - 2\\) is 2.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some algebra concepts.\n\nFirst, since these are roots of a polynomial, Vieta's formulas might be helpful here. Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. For a quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -a, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is b, the sum of the products three at a time is -c, and the product of all roots is d. \n\nWait, but the given equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Let me check the coefficients again. The standard form is x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0. Comparing, here a = 2, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2. So applying Vieta's formulas:\n\nSum of roots: α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a = -2.\n\nSum of products two at a time: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b = 0.\n\nSum of products three at a time: α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c = 0.\n\nProduct of all roots: α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d = 2.\n\nBut the problem is asking about the expressions that are sums of products of roots two at a time, but in a specific pairing: α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, and α₁α₄ + α₂α₃. These are different from the usual elementary symmetric sums. Let me denote these three expressions as S₁, S₂, S₃:\n\nS₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄,\n\nS₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄,\n\nS₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.\n\nI need to find the set {S₁, S₂, S₃}. Since the roots are distinct, the order in the pairs doesn't matter, so the set is unordered.\n\nHmm, how can I relate these S₁, S₂, S₃ to the known symmetric sums from Vieta's formulas? Let's see. Let's compute the squares of these expressions or maybe find some relations between them.\n\nFirst, note that S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄. Wait, that's exactly the sum of products two at a time, which Vieta's tells us is 0. So S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0.\n\nThat's a start. So the sum of S₁, S₂, S₃ is zero. So we know that each of these expressions must satisfy that their sum is zero. Therefore, if we can find another relation, perhaps their products or other combinations, we can find the possible values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the polynomial whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃. If we can find such a polynomial, then we can find the set. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the original polynomial in terms of variables that represent these products. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, note that the original polynomial can be factored if we pair the roots appropriately. Let me try to factor x⁴ + 2x³ + 2. Maybe it factors into quadratics. Let's suppose that x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d). Let's try to find a, b, c, d.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side: x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (b + d + a c)x² + (a d + b c)x + b d.\n\nComparing coefficients with x⁴ + 2x³ + 2:\n\n1. Coefficient of x⁴: 1, which matches.\n\n2. Coefficient of x³: a + c = 2.\n\n3. Coefficient of x²: b + d + a c = 0 (since there's no x² term in the original polynomial).\n\n4. Coefficient of x: a d + b c = 0 (since there's no x term in the original polynomial).\n\n5. Constant term: b d = 2.\n\nSo we have the system:\n\na + c = 2,\n\nb + d + a c = 0,\n\na d + b c = 0,\n\nb d = 2.\n\nThis is a system of equations in variables a, b, c, d. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, since a + c = 2, we can let c = 2 - a.\n\nThen, substitute c = 2 - a into the other equations.\n\nSecond equation: b + d + a(2 - a) = 0 ⇒ b + d = a² - 2a.\n\nThird equation: a d + b(2 - a) = 0 ⇒ a d + 2b - a b = 0 ⇒ a d = a b - 2b ⇒ d = (a b - 2b)/a = b(a - 2)/a.\n\nFourth equation: b d = 2.\n\nSo substitute d from third equation into fourth equation:\n\nb * [b(a - 2)/a] = 2 ⇒ (b² (a - 2))/a = 2 ⇒ b² (a - 2) = 2a.\n\nAlso, from the second equation, b + d = a² - 2a. But d = b(a - 2)/a, so:\n\nb + [b(a - 2)/a] = a² - 2a ⇒ b [1 + (a - 2)/a] = a² - 2a ⇒ b [ (a + (a - 2)) / a ] = a² - 2a ⇒ b [ (2a - 2)/a ] = a² - 2a ⇒ b (2(a - 1)/a) = a(a - 2).\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\n2b(a - 1) = a²(a - 2).\n\nSo now we have two equations involving a and b:\n\n1. From the fourth equation substitution: b²(a - 2) = 2a.\n\n2. From the second equation substitution: 2b(a - 1) = a²(a - 2).\n\nLet me denote these as equations (1) and (2):\n\nEquation (1): b²(a - 2) = 2a.\n\nEquation (2): 2b(a - 1) = a²(a - 2).\n\nLet me try to solve these. Let's express b from equation (2):\n\nFrom equation (2): 2b(a - 1) = a²(a - 2) ⇒ b = [a²(a - 2)] / [2(a - 1)].\n\nNow substitute this into equation (1):\n\n[ (a²(a - 2)/ (2(a - 1)) ) ]² * (a - 2) = 2a.\n\nCompute left-hand side:\n\n[ a^4(a - 2)^2 / (4(a - 1)^2) ) ] * (a - 2) = a^4(a - 2)^3 / [4(a - 1)^2].\n\nSet equal to 2a:\n\na^4(a - 2)^3 / [4(a - 1)^2] = 2a.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4(a - 1)^2:\n\na^4(a - 2)^3 = 8a(a - 1)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0):\n\na^3(a - 2)^3 = 8(a - 1)^2.\n\nSo we have a^3(a - 2)^3 - 8(a - 1)^2 = 0.\n\nThis looks complicated. Let me check if there are rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±8. Let's test a = 1:\n\n1^3(1 - 2)^3 - 8(1 - 1)^2 = 1*(-1)^3 - 8*0 = -1 ≠ 0.\n\na = 2:\n\n2^3(0)^3 -8(1)^2 = 0 -8 = -8 ≠0.\n\na = -1:\n\n(-1)^3(-3)^3 -8( -2)^2 = (-1)(-27) -8(4) =27 -32= -5≠0.\n\na=4:\n\n4^3(2)^3 -8(3)^2=64*8 -8*9=512 -72=440≠0.\n\na=0:\n\n0 -8( -1)^2= -8≠0.\n\nHmm, maybe no rational roots. This approach might not be helpful. Maybe there's a different way to factor the original polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the polynomial is irreducible over the reals, but since it has four roots (since it's a quartic with real coefficients, the roots come in complex conjugate pairs). So perhaps the polynomial can be factored into two quadratics with real coefficients, but as above, but solving for a, b, c, d seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set y = x + k, but not sure. Alternatively, check if the polynomial can be written as (x² + p x + q)^2 + r. Let's try.\n\nx⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (x² + a x + b)^2 + c.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side: x⁴ + 2a x³ + (a² + 2b)x² + 2ab x + b² + c.\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nx⁴: 1=1.\n\nx³: 2a = 2 ⇒ a =1.\n\nx²: a² + 2b = 0 ⇒ 1 + 2b =0 ⇒ b= -1/2.\n\nx term: 2ab =0 ⇒ 2*1*(-1/2)= -1. But in original polynomial, coefficient of x is 0. So -1=0? Not possible. So this approach doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe a different substitution.\n\nAlternatively, note that the polynomial is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2. Let me try to see if it can be written as (x² + x)^2 + (x + 2). Let's compute (x² + x)^2 = x⁴ + 2x³ + x². Then (x² + x)^2 + (x + 2) = x⁴ + 2x³ + x² + x + 2. Not the same as original. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute x = y - 1/2 to eliminate the cubic term? Let's try. Let x = y - 1/2. Then x³ = (y - 1/2)^3 = y³ - (3/2)y² + (3/4)y - 1/8. x⁴ = (y - 1/2)^4 = y⁴ - 2y³ + (3/2)y² - (1/2)y + 1/16. So substituting into x⁴ + 2x³ + 2:\n\nx⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = [y⁴ - 2y³ + (3/2)y² - (1/2)y + 1/16] + 2[y³ - (3/2)y² + (3/4)y - 1/8] + 2.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\ny⁴ term: y⁴.\n\ny³ terms: -2y³ + 2y³ = 0.\n\ny² terms: (3/2)y² - 3y² = - (3/2)y².\n\ny terms: - (1/2)y + (3/2)y = (2/2)y = y.\n\nConstants: 1/16 - 2/8 + 2 = 1/16 - 1/4 + 2 = (1 - 4 + 32)/16 = 29/16.\n\nSo the transformed polynomial is y⁴ - (3/2)y² + y + 29/16 = 0. Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Perhaps this is not the right substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that if the polynomial is factorable into quadratics, then the quadratic factors can be found using the above system of equations. But since solving for a, b, c, d led to a complicated equation, maybe instead of trying to factor it, use Vieta's formulas in another way.\n\nWe know that S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0. Let me compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃. If I can find this sum, then perhaps we can find the product S₁S₂S₃, and then construct the cubic equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃.\n\nLet's compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, S₁S₂ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄). Let's expand this:\n\n= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄².\n\nSimilarly, S₁S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄.\n\nS₂S₃ = (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁²α₃", "answer": "\\{1\\pm\\sqrt{5},-2\\}"}

Hmm, the original says \"Trzy ools i grossa gomka\" and \"pié五 ools i grossa gomka\". So, three ools and a big eraser cost $1.24, and five ools and a big eraser cost $1.82. We need to find out how much one ool costs in cents.\n\nAlright, so let me parse this. Let's denote the cost of one ool as O and the cost of the big eraser as E. Then, according to the problem:\n\n3O + E = 1.24  ...(1)\n5O + E = 1.82  ...(2)\n\nWe need to solve for O. Since both equations have E, maybe we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate E. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2):\n\n(5O + E) - (3O + E) = 1.82 - 1.24\n\nSimplify left side: 5O - 3O + E - E = 2O\n\nRight side: 1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58\n\nSo, 2O = 0.58\n\nTherefore, O = 0.58 / 2 = 0.29\n\nSo, one ool is $0.29. Since the question asks for the price in cents, we multiply by 100. 0.29 * 100 = 29 cents.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. If three ools and a eraser are $1.24, then three ools would be 3*0.29 = $0.87. Then the eraser would be 1.24 - 0.87 = $0.37. Then five ools would be 5*0.29 = $1.45. Then adding the eraser: 1.45 + 0.37 = $1.82, which matches the second equation. So yes, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29 cents. So the ool costs 29 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe oool costs \\boxed{29} cents.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( O \\) be the cost of one ool and \\( E \\) be the cost of the big eraser.

Hmm, let's see. First, maybe I should convert that fraction into a decimal to make it easier to see the digits. Let me start by simplifying the fraction if possible. \n\n137 and 500, do they have any common factors? Let's check. 137 is a prime number? Well, 137 divided by 2 is 68.5, not integer. Divided by 3 is like 45.666... not integer. Let me check primes up to sqrt(137) which is about 11.7. So primes up to 11: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. 137 divided by 5 is 27.4, nope. Divided by 7 is around 19.57, not integer. Divided by 11 is 12.45... So yeah, 137 is a prime number. So 137 and 500 share no common factors besides 1. So the fraction is already in simplest terms.\n\nNow, 500 is 5^3 * 2^2. So the denominator is 2^2 * 5^3. To convert this into a decimal, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. Let's see: 500 is 5^3 * 2^2. To make the denominator 10^3, which is 2^3 * 5^3, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2. So:\n\n137/500 = (137 * 2) / (500 * 2) = 274 / 1000 = 0.274.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So 137 divided by 500 is 0.274. So the decimal expansion is 0.274, which has three decimal digits. The digits are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit here is 4, right? Because after 4, there are no more digits. So is the answer 4?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me verify the division. 500 goes into 137 how many times? 500 is larger than 137, so the decimal starts with 0. Then 1370 divided by 500 is 2.74, so 2. Then multiply 2 by 500 is 1000, subtract from 1370, we get 370. Bring down a zero: 3700. 500 goes into 3700 7 times (500*7=3500). Subtract 3500 from 3700: 200. Bring down a zero: 2000. 500 goes into 2000 exactly 4 times. So that gives 0.274. So yes, 0.274. So the digits are 2, 7, 4, and then zeros. So the last non-zero digit is 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in decimal expansions, especially when dividing numbers, there might be a repeating pattern or something that causes more digits. But in this case, 137/500 is a terminating decimal because the denominator after simplifying is a product of 2s and 5s. So it terminates after three decimal places. So there are no repeating digits here. So the decimal expansion is finite with three digits: 2, 7, 4. So the last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I need to check if there's another way this could be presented. For example, if the fraction was something like 137/5000, which would be 0.0274, but in this case, it's 137/500. So 0.274. So the last non-zero digit is 4. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. So as before, 137*2=274, denominator 500*2=1000. So 274/1000=0.274. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trickier. For example, if the decimal didn't terminate, like if it was 137/6 or something, but in this case, it's 500. So denominator is 500. So in that case, the decimal terminates. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the decimal. Let's do the long division manually.\n\nDividing 137 by 500. Since 500 is larger than 137, we write 0. Then 1370 divided by 500. 500*2=1000, which is less than 1370. 500*3=1500, which is too much. So 2. 2*500=1000. Subtract from 1370: 1370-1000=370. Bring down a zero: 3700. 500*7=3500. Subtract from 3700: 3700-3500=200. Bring down a zero: 2000. 500*4=2000. Subtract: 0. So the division ends here. So 0.274. So yes, the decimal is 0.274, last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way. For example, maybe using the concept of trailing zeros or something else. But since the decimal terminates, there are no trailing zeros after 4. So 4 is the last non-zero digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. For example, if it was 137 divided by 5000, which would be 0.0274, but in that case, the last non-zero digit is still 4. But here, the decimal is 0.274, so the last non-zero digit is 4.\n\nWait, let me confirm once again. 137 divided by 500. 500 times 0.2 is 100. 500 times 0.27 is 135. Then 500 times 0.274 is 137. So 0.274*500=137. Correct. So yes, 0.274. So the digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4, then zero. So the last non-zero digit is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So I think the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}\n</think>\n\nTo find the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{137}{500}\\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.\n\nFirst, we note that 500 can be written as \\(2^2 \\times 5^3\\).

The rectangle has AB/AD = k, which I guess means the ratio of the length to the width is k. Let me try to visualize this. The rectangle is centered at O, which is the midpoint. So O is the center point of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I remember that the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. So if I want points closer to O than to any vertex, I need to find the region where the distance from the point to O is less than the distance to each of the vertices.\n\nThis sounds like I need to determine the Voronoi region around O relative to the four vertices. But since all four vertices are symmetric with respect to the center, maybe I can exploit that symmetry to simplify the problem.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates. Let's place the rectangle in a coordinate system such that O is at (0, 0). Let’s let the length AB be 2a, so that the coordinates of the vertices are A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(a, -b), D(-a, -b), where AD would be 2b. Wait, but the problem states AB/AD = k. So AB is the length, which is 2a, and AD is the width, which is 2b. Therefore, (2a)/(2b) = k, so a/b = k. Therefore, a = b*k. So the coordinates are A(-b*k, b), B(b*k, b), C(b*k, -b), D(-b*k, -b). But maybe it's simpler to let AB = 2 and AD = 2/k, so that AB/AD = k. Then coordinates would be A(-1, 1/k), B(1, 1/k), C(1, -1/k), D(-1, -1/k). But maybe scaling is not important because we can normalize the rectangle. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, set AB = 2k and AD = 2, so that AB/AD = k. Then coordinates would be A(-k, 1), B(k, 1), C(k, -1), D(-k, -1). Then the center O is at (0, 0). This might make calculations easier. Let's go with that. So the rectangle has length 2k and width 2, centered at the origin.\n\nWait, but if AB is 2k and AD is 2, then yes, the ratio is k. But then the coordinates would depend on k. Hmm, but maybe it's better to keep AB as length and AD as width, with AB/AD = k, so AB = k*AD. So if AD = 2, AB = 2k. But maybe instead of fixing AD, let's make AB = 2k and AD = 2. Then the rectangle extends from (-k, -1) to (k, 1). That seems manageable. Alternatively, maybe set AB = 2 and AD = 2/k, so that the rectangle is from (-1, -1/k) to (1, 1/k). But either way, scaling might complicate things. Maybe it's better to work with variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's just let the rectangle have length 2L and width 2W, so that AB = 2L and AD = 2W, so the ratio L/W = k. Then L = k*W. The center is at (0,0). The problem is to find the area of the region inside the rectangle where a point (x,y) is closer to (0,0) than to any of the four vertices (L, W), (-L, W), (L, -W), (-L, -W). Then divide that area by the area of the rectangle to get the probability.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 4LW. The region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex would be the intersection of the regions closer to O than to each vertex. Since all four vertices are symmetric, the region should be symmetric in all four quadrants. So maybe I can compute the area in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the vertex is at (L, W). So we need to find the set of points (x,y) where sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - L)² + (y - W)²). Squaring both sides, x² + y² < (x - L)² + (y - W)².\n\nExpanding the right side: x² - 2Lx + L² + y² - 2Wy + W².\n\nSubtract left side from both sides: 0 < -2Lx + L² - 2Wy + W².\n\nSo 2Lx + 2Wy < L² + W².\n\nDivide both sides by 2: Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x and y are between 0 and L, 0 and W respectively.\n\nSo the inequality is Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2.\n\nSimilarly, in other quadrants, the inequalities would differ due to the signs of x and y. But since we are considering symmetry, maybe we can focus on the first quadrant and then multiply by 4. However, we need to check if the regions in different quadrants overlap or not.\n\nWait, but actually, since the center O is at (0,0), and the vertices are in all four quadrants. So for a point to be closer to O than to any vertex, it needs to be closer to O than to all four vertices. So in each quadrant, the region closer to O than to the vertex in that quadrant. But since the vertices are in different quadrants, the regions in each quadrant might not overlap. Hmm, maybe. Let me think.\n\nSuppose in the first quadrant, the inequality is Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2. Similarly, in the second quadrant, the vertex is (-L, W), so the inequality would be L*(-x) + W*y < (L² + W²)/2, which is -Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2. Similarly, in the third quadrant, the vertex is (-L, -W), so inequality is -Lx - Wy < (L² + W²)/2. In the fourth quadrant, vertex is (L, -W), so inequality is Lx - Wy < (L² + W²)/2. So each quadrant has a different inequality. Therefore, the regions in different quadrants are separate. Therefore, to find the total area, we can compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nTherefore, let's focus on the first quadrant. The region is defined by Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2, with x ∈ [0, L], y ∈ [0, W]. But we also have to ensure that the point is inside the rectangle, which in the first quadrant is 0 ≤ x ≤ L, 0 ≤ y ≤ W.\n\nSo let's analyze the inequality Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2.\n\nLet's rearrange this inequality: Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nLx < (L² + W²)/2 - Wy\n\nSimilarly, since x and y are positive in the first quadrant, maybe we can express y in terms of x.\n\nLet me solve for y:\n\nWy < (L² + W²)/2 - Lx\n\n=> y < [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W\n\nSimilarly, x < [(L² + W²)/2 - Wy]/L\n\nBut since we are in the first quadrant, x and y are bounded by L and W.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to graph the line Lx + Wy = (L² + W²)/2 in the first quadrant and find the area below this line within the rectangle.\n\nThe line Lx + Wy = (L² + W²)/2.\n\nLet me find the intercepts.\n\nWhen x = 0: Wy = (L² + W²)/2 => y = (L² + W²)/(2W)\n\nBut since in the first quadrant, y cannot exceed W. So (L² + W²)/(2W) must be compared to W.\n\nCompute (L² + W²)/(2W) - W = (L² + W² - 2W²)/(2W) = (L² - W²)/(2W)\n\nIf L > W, which is true since AB/AD = k, and AB = 2L, AD = 2W, so k = AB/AD = L/W. So if k > 1, then L > W, so (L² - W²)/(2W) is positive, meaning that (L² + W²)/(2W) > W. Therefore, the line intersects the y-axis above the rectangle's upper boundary y = W. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the line Lx + Wy = (L² + W²)/2 intersects the y-axis at y = (L² + W²)/(2W) > W, which is outside the rectangle. Therefore, within the first quadrant, the line will intersect the top edge y = W. Let's find that intersection.\n\nSet y = W in the equation Lx + W*W = (L² + W²)/2.\n\nSo Lx + W² = (L² + W²)/2\n\n=> Lx = (L² + W²)/2 - W² = (L² - W²)/2\n\n=> x = (L² - W²)/(2L)\n\nSimilarly, when y = 0, x = (L² + W²)/(2L). But since L > W, (L² + W²)/(2L) > (L²)/(2L) = L/2. Since the rectangle's x goes up to L, the line intersects the x-axis at x = (L² + W²)/(2L) which is greater than L/2. So in the first quadrant, the line intersects the top edge at x = (L² - W²)/(2L), y = W and the right edge at x = (L² + W²)/(2L), y = 0. Wait, but wait, when y = 0, x = (L² + W²)/(2L). But since the rectangle's width is L, if (L² + W²)/(2L) > L, then the intersection is outside the rectangle. Let's check:\n\n(L² + W²)/(2L) > L ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2L (positive):\n\nL² + W² > 2L²\n\n=> W² > L²\n\n=> W > L\n\nBut since k = L/W, and if k > 1, then L > W, so W < L. Therefore, W² < L², so (L² + W²)/(2L) < L. Therefore, the intersection with the x-axis is at x = (L² + W²)/(2L) < L. So within the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the line Lx + Wy = (L² + W²)/2 intersects the top edge at x = (L² - W²)/(2L), y = W and the right edge at x = (L² + W²)/(2L), y = 0. So the region closer to O in the first quadrant is below this line.\n\nTherefore, the area in the first quadrant is the area under the line from x = 0 to x = (L² - W²)/(2L) along the top edge, but wait, no. Wait, when x goes from 0 to (L² - W²)/(2L), the line is going from y = (L² + W²)/(2W) (which is outside the rectangle) down to y = W at x = (L² - W²)/(2L). Wait, perhaps it's better to integrate.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up the integral for the area in the first quadrant where Lx + Wy < (L² + W²)/2.\n\nSo we can express y < [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W.\n\nBut y must also be less than W. So the upper bound for y is the minimum of [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W and W.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, when x = 0, [(L² + W²)/2 - 0]/W = (L² + W²)/(2W). Which is greater than W. Therefore, the line crosses the top edge y = W at some x. Let's find that x.\n\nSet [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W = W\n\nMultiply both sides by W:\n\n(L² + W²)/2 - Lx = W²\n\n=> -Lx = W² - (L² + W²)/2 = (2W² - L² - W²)/2 = (W² - L²)/2\n\n=> Lx = (L² - W²)/2\n\n=> x = (L² - W²)/(2L)\n\nSo for x < (L² - W²)/(2L), the upper bound for y is [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W, which is greater than W. For x ≥ (L² - W²)/(2L), the upper bound for y is W. Therefore, the area in the first quadrant is the integral from x = 0 to x = (L² - W²)/(2L) of [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx]/W dx, plus the integral from x = (L² - W²)/(2L) to x = L of W dx.\n\nSo let's compute these two integrals.\n\nFirst integral (from 0 to (L² - W²)/(2L)):\n\nIntegral [((L² + W²)/2 - Lx)/W] dx\n\nLet me factor out 1/W:\n\n(1/W) * Integral [(L² + W²)/2 - Lx] dx\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\n(1/W) * [ ((L² + W²)/2)x - (L/2)x² ] evaluated from 0 to (L² - W²)/(2L)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nAt upper limit x = (L² - W²)/(2L):\n\n[(L² + W²)/2 * (L² - W²)/(2L)] - [L/2 * ((L² - W²)/(2L))²]\n\nSimilarly, subtract the value at 0, which is 0.\n\nLet's compute the first term:\n\n[(L² + W²)/2 * (L² - W²)/(2L)] = [(L^4 - W^4)/(4L)]\n\nSecond term:\n\n[L/2 * ((L² - W²)^2)/(4L²)] = [L/2 * (L^4 - 2L²W² + W^4)/(4L²)] = [ (L^4 -", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}"}
{"original_question": "Określ resztę z dzielenia 54 (mod 6).", "question": "Określ resztę z dzielenia 54 (mod 6).", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Hmm, right. So modulo operations can sometimes be tricky if you don't remember the exact method, but let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what division with remainder means. If we divide a number a by another number b, we can express it as a = b*q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. The remainder has to be less than b. So in this case, a is 54 and b is 6. I need to find q and r such that 54 = 6*q + r, and 0 ≤ r < 6.\n\nAlright, so let's start by doing the division. Dividing 54 by 6. Let me compute 6 times 9. 6*9 is 54. Wait, so 6*9 = 54. That means that the quotient q is 9 and the remainder r is 0 because there's nothing left over. Let me check that again. If I multiply 6 by 9, I get 54, and subtract that from 54, the remainder is 0. So yes, 54 divided by 6 is exactly 9 with a remainder of 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this another way. Let's use the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any integers a and b (with b > 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = b*q + r and 0 ≤ r < b. Here, a is 54 and b is 6. So we need to find q and r accordingly.\n\nStarting with 54 divided by 6. Let's see how many times 6 goes into 54. Well, 6*1=6, 6*2=12, 6*3=18, 6*4=24, 6*5=30, 6*6=36, 6*7=42, 6*8=48, 6*9=54. So 6 goes into 54 exactly 9 times, and there's no remainder. Therefore, r is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about multiples of 6. Let's list them out: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, etc. So 54 is the 9th multiple of 6 (since 6*9=54). Therefore, when you divide 54 by 6, there's no remainder left. That confirms it again.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try using another method. Maybe using subtraction. If I subtract 6 from 54 repeatedly until I can't subtract anymore. Let's see:\n\n54 - 6 = 48 (1)\n48 - 6 = 42 (2)\n42 - 6 = 36 (3)\n36 - 6 = 30 (4)\n30 - 6 = 24 (5)\n24 - 6 = 18 (6)\n18 - 6 = 12 (7)\n12 - 6 = 6 (8)\n6 - 6 = 0 (9)\n\nSo I subtracted 6 nine times before reaching 0. That means 54 is 6 subtracted nine times, which is the same as 6*9. Therefore, the remainder is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using prime factors. 6 is 2*3. 54 is 6*9, which is 2*3*9. So 54 is clearly a multiple of 6, so dividing by 6 would leave no remainder. That's another way to see it.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to think about this in case there was a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me check with a different number. For example, if the number was 55, then 55 divided by 6 is 9*6=54, remainder 1. So the remainder is 1. But in this case, 54 is exactly 6*9, so remainder 0. That seems straightforward.\n\nAnother check: 54 divided by 6. Let's use decimal division. 6 goes into 54 how many times? 6*9=54, so exactly 9.0 times. So the decimal division gives a whole number, which implies no remainder.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents or other operations. But that might complicate things. Maybe overcomplicating. The key here is that 54 is a multiple of 6, so the remainder should be zero.\n\nLet me also recall that in modular arithmetic, a mod b is the remainder when a is divided by b. So if a is a multiple of b, then a mod b is 0. For example, 12 mod 6 is 0, 15 mod 3 is 0, etc. So since 54 is a multiple of 6, 54 mod 6 must be 0.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and methods, I can confidently say that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (with \\(b > 0\\)), there exist unique integers \\(q\\) (the quotient) and \\(r\\) (the remainder) such that \\(a = b \\cdot q + r\\) and \\(0 \\leq r < b\\).\n\n1. **Division Calculation**:\n   - Dividing 54 by 6, we find that \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\).\n   - This means the quotient \\(q\\) is 9 and the remainder \\(r\\) is 0 because there is no remainder left after dividing 54 by 6.\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - Listing the multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, etc. We see that 54 is the 9th multiple of 6, confirming that 54 is exactly divisible by 6 with no remainder.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 54 is a multiple of 6, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.\n\nThus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", "answer": "0"}

Let me first understand the function f(n). It's defined piecewise: if n is greater than or equal to 4, then f(n) is the floor of n; if n is less than 4, then f(n) is the ceiling of n. Alright, so for each term in the sum, I need to check if the input is less than 4 or not, apply the corresponding ceiling or floor function, and then add them all up.\n\nLet's start with the first term: f(π/3). I know π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 is about 1.0472. Since 1.0472 is definitely less than 4, I need to apply the ceiling function here. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. For 1.0472, the ceiling would be 2 because 2 is the smallest integer not less than 1.0472. So f(π/3) = 2.\n\nNext, f(√45). Let's calculate √45. I remember that √45 is the same as √(9*5) which simplifies to 3√5. √5 is approximately 2.236, so 3*2.236 is about 6.708. Since 6.708 is greater than 4, we apply the floor function here. The floor of 6.708 is 6 because 6 is the largest integer less than or equal to 6.708. So f(√45) = 6.\n\nNow the third term: f(8^(2/3)). Let me compute 8^(2/3). 8 is 2^3, so 8^(2/3) is (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2^2 = 4. Wait, that's exactly 4. So 8^(2/3) is 4. Therefore, since n is equal to 4, we apply the floor function here. The floor of 4 is 4. So f(8^(2/3)) = 4.\n\nAdding them all up: 2 (from the first term) + 6 (from the second term) + 4 (from the third term) equals 2 + 6 is 8, plus 4 is 12. So the total should be 12.\n\nLet me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For π/3: π is approximately 3.1416, divided by 3 is indeed around 1.047, which is less than 4. Ceiling of that is 2. Correct.\n\n√45: 45 is between 36 (6^2) and 49 (7^2), so √45 is between 6 and 7. Precisely, since 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is close to 45, so √45 is approximately 6.708, which is less than 7, so yes, ceiling of that is 7... Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, 6.708 is approximately the square root of 45? Let me check that again. 6.7 squared is 6*6 + 6*0.7*2 + 0.7^2 = 36 + 8.4 + 0.49 = 44.89. So 6.7 squared is 44.89, which is just a bit less than 45. So √45 is approximately 6.708, which is slightly more than 6.7. So the ceiling of 6.708 is 7? Wait, but 6.708 is greater than 6.7, but less than 7. So the ceiling of 6.708 is 7? Wait, but 6.708 is not an integer. Wait, ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. So 6.708 is between 6 and 7, closer to 7, but the ceiling is still 7. Wait, but 6.708 is not an integer, so the ceiling of 6.708 would be 7? Wait, no. Wait, ceiling of 6.708 is 7? Wait, let me confirm. If the number is 6.708, which is more than 6 but less than 7. The ceiling is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number. So since 6.708 is greater than 6, the ceiling is 7. Yes. So f(√45) = 7? Wait, but wait, the problem says if n is less than 4, apply ceiling, else floor. But √45 is approximately 6.708, which is less than 4? Wait, no. 6.708 is greater than 4. Wait, 6.708 is about 6.7, which is way larger than 4. So 6.708 is greater than 4, so we apply floor function, which would be 6. So f(√45) = 6. Wait, but I just thought that maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. If n is 6.708, which is greater than 4, so floor(n) is 6. So the ceiling function is only applied when n is less than 4. So that's correct. So f(√45) is 6. So my initial calculation was correct. I confused myself with the decimal approximation, but since 6.708 is greater than 4, floor is 6. So that's correct.\n\nThird term: 8^(2/3). Let's verify that. 8^(1/3) is 2, since 2^3 = 8. So 8^(2/3) is (8^(1/3))^2 = 2^2 = 4. So that's exactly 4. So since n is equal to 4, which is the boundary condition. The function says if n >=4, apply floor. So floor(4) is 4. So f(8^(2/3)) = 4. Correct.\n\nSo adding all together: 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. So the answer should be 12. Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up ceiling and floor. For the first term, n = π/3 ≈1.047, which is less than 4, so ceiling is 2. Correct. Second term, n ≈6.708, which is greater than 4, so floor is 6. Correct. Third term, n = 4, so floor is 4. Correct. So 2 + 6 + 4 is indeed 12. Alright, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \\), we need to evaluate each term using the piecewise function \\( f(n) \\).\n\n1. **Evaluating \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\):**\n   - \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\approx 1.0472 \\), which is less than 4.\n   - Apply the ceiling function: \\( \\lceil 1.0472 \\rceil = 2 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Evaluating \\( f(\\sqrt{45}) \\):**\n   - \\( \\sqrt{45} \\approx 6.708 \\), which is greater than 4.\n   - Apply the floor function: \\( \\lfloor 6.708 \\rfloor = 6 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f(\\sqrt{45}) = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating \\( f(8^{2/3}) \\):**\n   - \\( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\), which is equal to 4.\n   - Apply the floor function: \\( \\lfloor 4 \\rfloor = 4 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \\).\n\nAdding these results together:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).", "answer": "12"}

Ile pieniędzy, w centach, zostało po tym, jak zamieniły jak najwięcej monet na banknoty?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so we have four people: Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie, who sold croissants and earned a total amount of money. The problem is asking how many cents would remain after they convert as much of their total money into banknotes as possible. So, basically, we need to find the remainder when the total amount they earned is converted into dollars, right? Because when you convert money into banknotes, you lose the remainder, which would be in cents. So the question is essentially asking for the total amount modulo 100, since there are 100 cents in a dollar.\n\nFirst, let's verify that each person's earnings are in dollars and cents. The amounts given are:\n\n- Linda: $27.47\n- Sherry: $35.23\n- June: $37.37\n- Connie: $26.52\n\nSo each of these is a decimal number with two decimal places, representing dollars and cents. Our goal is to add all these amounts together and then find the remainder when divided by 1 dollar (or 100 cents). That remainder will be the leftover cents they can't convert into a full dollar bill.\n\nLet me start by adding up all their earnings step by step. Maybe converting each to cents first would make it easier to add and then find the remainder.\n\nConverting each person's earnings to cents:\n\n- Linda: $27.47 = 27 * 100 + 47 = 2747 cents\n- Sherry: $35.23 = 35 * 100 + 23 = 3523 cents\n- June: $37.37 = 37 * 100 + 37 = 3737 cents\n- Connie: $26.52 = 26 * 100 + 52 = 2652 cents\n\nNow, let's add these four numbers together:\n\n2747 (Linda)\n+3523 (Sherry)\n+3737 (June)\n+2652 (Connie)\n----------\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, add Linda and Sherry:\n\n2747 + 3523\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n2747 + 3523. Let's add the thousands: 2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\nThen the hundreds: 700 + 500 = 1200 → 5000 + 1200 = 6200\n\nTens: 40 + 20 = 60 → 6200 + 60 = 6260\n\nOnes: 7 + 3 = 10 → 6260 + 10 = 6270\n\nWait, that's 6270, but let's check:\n\n2747 + 3523:\n\n2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\n700 + 500 = 1200 → 5000 + 1200 = 6200\n\n40 + 20 = 60 → 6200 + 60 = 6260\n\n7 + 3 = 10 → 6260 + 10 = 6270. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo Linda and Sherry together have 6270 cents.\n\nNow add June's 3737 cents:\n\n6270 + 3737\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n6000 + 3000 = 9000\n\n200 + 700 = 900 → 9000 + 900 = 9900\n\n70 + 30 = 100 → 9900 + 100 = 10000\n\nOnes: 0 + 7 = 7 → 10000 + 7 = 10007\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6270 + 3737:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 30 = 9990\n\n9990 + 7 = 10000 + 0 = 10007? Wait, no. Wait, 6270 + 3737:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 37 = 10007. Oh, right. Because 737 is 700 + 37.\n\nWait, maybe another way:\n\n6270 + 3737:\n\nAdd the thousands: 6000 + 3000 = 9000\n\nHundreds: 200 + 700 = 900 → 9000 + 900 = 9900\n\nTens: 70 + 30 = 100 → 9900 + 100 = 10000\n\nOnes: 0 + 7 = 7 → 10000 + 7 = 10007. Yes, that's correct. So total is 10,007 cents. Wait, but 6270 + 3737 is 10,007? Let me check with another method.\n\n6270 + 3737:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 30 = 9990\n\n9990 + 7 = 10000 + 0 = 10007? Wait, 9990 + 7 is 10000 + 0? Wait, 9990 + 7 = 10000 - 1 +7 = 10000 +6=10006? Wait, 9990 + 7 is 9997. Wait, so there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, 6270 + 3737:\n\nLet me do this step by step:\n\nStart with 6270.\n\nAdd 3000: 6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\nAdd 700: 9270 + 700 = 9970\n\nAdd 30: 9970 + 30 = 9990\n\nAdd 7: 9990 + 7 = 9997. Oh, right, because 737 is 700 + 37, but 3737 is 3000 + 700 + 37. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently.\n\nAlternatively, 6270 + 3737:\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 30 = 9990\n\n9990 + 7 = 9997. Yes, that's correct. So previous step had an error in the explanation but the result is 9,997 cents.\n\nThen add Connie's 2652 cents:\n\n9997 + 2652\n\nLet's compute:\n\n9997 + 2000 = 11,997\n\n11,997 + 600 = 12,597\n\n12,597 + 50 = 12,647\n\n12,647 + 2 = 12,649. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, 9997 + 2652.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n9997 + 2652\n\nBreak down 2652 into 2000 + 600 + 50 + 2.\n\n9997 + 2000 = 11,997\n\n11,997 + 600 = 12,597\n\n12,597 + 50 = 12,647\n\n12,647 + 2 = 12,649. So total is 12,649 cents.\n\nWait, let me check with another method:\n\n9997 + 2652:\n\n9997 + 2000 = 11,997\n\n11,997 + 600 = 12,597\n\n12,597 + 50 = 12,647\n\n12,647 + 2 = 12,649. Yes.\n\nSo the total amount in cents is 12,649.\n\nNow, we need to find how much this is when converted into dollars, i.e., divide by 100 and find the remainder. Because the remainder would be the leftover cents they can't convert into a dollar.\n\nSo 12,649 divided by 100. Let's compute that.\n\n12,649 ÷ 100 = 126.49 dollars. So the total amount is $126.49, which means there are 49 cents remaining. Because 126 dollars is 12,600 cents, so 12,649 - 12,600 = 49 cents.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 49 cents.\n\nBut let me verify this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in addition.\n\nFirst, converting each amount to cents:\n\n- Linda: $27.47 = 27*100 + 47 = 2700 +47=2747\n- Sherry: $35.23=35*100 +23=3500+23=3523\n- June: $37.37=37*100 +37=3700+37=3737\n- Connie: $26.52=26*100 +52=2600+52=2652\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFirst, Linda + Sherry: 2747 + 3523\n\n2747 + 3523:\n\n2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\n700 + 500 = 1200 → 5000 + 1200 = 6200\n\n40 + 20 = 60 → 6200 + 60 = 6260\n\n7 + 3 = 10 → 6260 + 10 = 6270. Correct.\n\nThen, add June: 6270 + 3737\n\n6270 + 3000 = 9270\n\n9270 + 700 = 9970\n\n9970 + 30 = 9990\n\n9990 + 7 = 9997. Correct.\n\nThen add Connie: 9997 + 2652\n\n9997 + 2000 = 11997\n\n11997 + 600 = 12597\n\n12597 + 50 = 12647\n\n12647 + 2 = 12649. Correct.\n\nTotal is 12,649 cents.\n\nDivide by 100: 12,649 ÷ 100 = 126.49, so remainder is 49. Therefore, 49 cents left over.\n\nAlternatively, compute 12,649 mod 100. Since 100*126 = 12,600. 12,649 - 12,600 = 49. So yes, remainder 49.\n\nSo the answer is 49 cents. Therefore, the amount remaining is 49 cents, which they can't convert into another dollar bill, so they would keep those 49 cents.\n\nWait, but let me check once again if there was a miscalculation in the total. Because sometimes when adding step by step, it's easy to make an error.\n\nTotal in dollars: Each person's amount in dollars:\n\nLinda: $27.47\n\nSherry: $35.23\n\nJune: $37.37\n\nConnie: $26.52\n\nTotal dollars: 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52\n\nLet me add these step by step in dollars:\n\nFirst, 27.47 + 35.23:\n\n27 + 35 = 62\n\n0.47 + 0.23 = 0.70\n\nSo total is $62.70\n\nThen, add June's 37.37:\n\n62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07\n\nWait, 62 + 37 = 99, 0.70 + 0.37 = 1.07, so total is $100.07.\n\nThen add Connie's 26.52:\n\n100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59\n\nSo total is $126.59.\n\nWait, hold on! Wait, that conflicts with the previous result. Earlier, when we converted to cents and got 12,649 cents, which is $126.49, but adding in dollars directly gives $126.59. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, there must be a miscalculation in one of the steps. Let me check both methods again.\n\nFirst, adding in cents:\n\n2747 (Linda) + ", "answer": "59"}

So, the class has 30 students. Some got 80, some 90, and some 100. Specifically, 20 students got 80, 8 got 90, and 2 got 100. Hmm, I need to find the arithmetic mean. Alright, arithmetic mean is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of students, right?\n\nFirst, let me check if the numbers add up to 30. 20 + 8 + 2. Let's see: 20 + 8 is 28, and 28 + 2 is 30. Yep, that's correct. So all 30 students are accounted for.\n\nNow, the next step is to calculate the total sum of all the scores. Let's do each group one by one. For the 20 students who got 80: 20 multiplied by 80. Let me compute that. 20 times 80 is 1600. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nThen, the 8 students who scored 90: 8 times 90. Hmm, 8 times 90 is 720. Right, because 8 times 100 is 800, minus 8 times 10, which is 80, so 800 - 80 = 720. Got that.\n\nNext, the 2 students who got 100: 2 times 100 is 200. Easy enough.\n\nNow, add all these totals together to get the overall sum. So, 1600 (from the 80s) plus 720 (from the 90s) plus 200 (from the 100s). Let me add them step by step. First, 1600 + 720. Let's see, 1600 + 700 is 2300, and then add 20 more to get 2320. Then, add the 200: 2320 + 200 = 2520. So the total sum of all the scores is 2520.\n\nNow, to find the average, divide this total by the number of students, which is 30. So, 2520 divided by 30. Let me do that division. Hmm, 30 times 80 is 2400. Subtract 2400 from 2520, and we get 120. Then, 30 goes into 120 exactly 4 times. So, 80 + 4 = 84. Therefore, 2520 divided by 30 is 84. \n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe break it down differently. 2520 divided by 30. If I divide both numerator and denominator by 10, it becomes 252 divided by 3, which is 84. Yep, same result. So the average is 84.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me verify each step again. \n\n20 students * 80 = 1600. Correct. 8 * 90 = 720. Correct. 2 * 100 = 200. Correct. Total sum 1600 + 720 = 2320. Then +200 = 2520. Correct. Divide by 30: 2520 / 30 = 84. Yes, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the average by using weighted averages. Since 20 out of 30 got 80, that's 2/3. 8 out of 30 is 4/15, and 2 out of 30 is 1/15. So, the average would be (2/3)*80 + (4/15)*90 + (1/15)*100. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, (2/3)*80: 2/3 of 80 is (80*2)/3 = 160/3 ≈ 53.333... Then, (4/15)*90: 4/15 of 90 is (4*90)/15 = 360/15 = 24. Then, (1/15)*100: 100/15 ≈ 6.666... Adding those together: 53.333 + 24 + 6.666 ≈ 84. Let me check the fractions. 160/3 + 24 + 100/15. Convert all to fifteenths to add them up. 160/3 = 800/15, 24 is 360/15, and 100/15 is 100/15. So total is (800 + 360 + 100)/15 = 1260/15 = 84. Perfect, that's the same answer. So regardless of the method, the average is 84. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of the class's test scores is 84.\n</think>\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the class's test scores is calculated by dividing the total sum of all scores by the number of students. \n\nFirst, compute the total scores:\n- 20 students scoring 80: \\(20 \\times 80 = 1600\\)\n- 8 students scoring 90: \\(8 \\times 90 = 720\\)\n- 2 students scoring 100: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n\nSumming these totals:  \n\\(1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\\)\n\nDivide by the number of students (30):  \n\\(\\frac{2520}{30} = 84\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{84}", "answer": "84"}

Let me first recall that in a magic square, the sum of each row, each column, and the two main diagonals must all be equal. The square is 3x3, so there are three rows, three columns, and two diagonals. Let me look at the Asymptote code provided to visualize the square.\n\nFrom the labels given:\n\nTop row:\n- First cell: n - 3\n- Middle cell: 3\n- Third cell: n + 1\n\nMiddle row:\n- First cell: n + 2\n- Middle cell: 2n - 9\n- Third cell: 1\n\nBottom row:\n- First cell: 2\n- Middle cell: n\n- Third cell: n - 1\n\nSo the magic square looks like this:\n\n| n - 3 | 3    | n + 1 |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| n + 2 | 2n - 9 | 1    |\n| 2    | n    | n - 1 |\n\nNow, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and diagonals must sum to the same value. Let's denote the common sum as S. So, for each row, column, and diagonal, the sum is S. I need to set up equations based on this and solve for n.\n\nFirst, maybe I can compute the sum of one of the rows or columns and then use that to find S. Let's start with the middle row because it has an unknown in the middle cell.\n\nMiddle row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6. So S = 3n - 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the top row can give me another equation. Let's check the top row:\n\n(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1. So S = 2n + 1.\n\nSince both are equal to S, set them equal to each other:\n\n3n - 6 = 2n + 1\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides:\n\nn - 6 = 1\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\nn = 7\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify if this works with other rows or columns.\n\nLet's check the middle column. The middle column is 3 (from top), 2n - 9 (middle), and n (bottom). If n = 7, then:\n\n3 + (2*7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n\nNow, check the top row sum when n = 7: (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Okay, that matches.\n\nMiddle row sum: (7 + 2) + (2*7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + (14 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15. Also matches.\n\nBottom row: 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. Good.\n\nNow check the columns:\n\nFirst column: (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2. With n =7: 4 + 9 + 2 =15. Correct.\n\nSecond column: 3 + (2n -9) + n. With n=7: 3 +5 +7=15. Correct.\n\nThird column: (n +1) +1 + (n -1). With n=7:8 +1 +6=15. Correct.\n\nNow check diagonals.\n\nTop-left to bottom-right: (n -3) + (2n -9) + (n -1). With n=7:4 +5 +6=15. Correct.\n\nTop-right to bottom-left: (n +1) + (2n -9) +2. With n=7:8 +5 +2=15. Correct.\n\nAll sums are 15, which matches.

So S=2n+1.\n\nFrom the middle row: (n +2)+(2n -9)+1=3n -6. So S=3n-6.\n\nSet equal: 2n +1=3n -6 → n=7. Correct.\n\nSo that's all checks out.

Ile stóp mniej niż Martha przeszedł Jim?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so there's this problem about Jim and Martha walking around a rectangular field. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, they're standing together on a rectangular field. Jim is going along the diagonal, while Martha is walking along the length and the width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. The question is asking how many fewer feet Jim walked compared to Martha. \n\nAlright, so I need to figure out the distance each of them covered and then find the difference. Let's start with Jim. He's walking the diagonal of the rectangle. To find the length of the diagonal in a rectangle, I remember the Pythagorean theorem. For a right-angled triangle, the diagonal (hypotenuse) squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, then the diagonal should be sqrt(400² + 300²). Let me calculate that. \n\n400 squared is 160,000 and 300 squared is 90,000. Adding those together gives 250,000. The square root of 250,000 is 500. So, Jim walked 500 feet. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow Martha is walking along the length and the width. So, she's going along the length and then the width, which would be 400 feet plus 300 feet. Wait, but does she go along the entire length and the entire width, making a rectangle path? That would be the perimeter, but only going length and width once each. So, 400 + 300 = 700 feet. But let me make sure.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that ω is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of 1 are 1, ω, and ω², where ω³ = 1. Also, there's a property that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might come in handy later. Since ω ≠ 1 (because if ω were 1, then the denominators would be 2, but I think the problem is considering ω as a primitive root, which is not 1), so we can safely use that identity.\n\nThe expression we need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me write that down:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nHmm, maybe I can combine these two fractions. Let's try to add them together. To add them, they need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So let's compute that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut since ω³ = 1, this simplifies to:\n\n1 + ω + ω² + 1 = (1 + ω + ω²) + 1\n\nBut we know from the identity that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so substituting that in:\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo the denominator simplifies to 1. That's nice. Now, let's compute the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAgain, using the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, this becomes:\n\n2 + (0 - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nWait, hold on. Let's check that again. If 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then ω + ω² = -1. So substituting back into the numerator:\n\n2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 1, so E = 1/1 = 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 1. But wait, that seems too straightforward. The problem says \"all possible values,\" implying there might be more than one. Did I miss something here?\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming ω is a primitive root. The problem says \"niech ωTerr[][]niech[/i] liczby zespoloną taką, что ω³ = 1.\" Which translates to \"Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1.\" So ω could be 1, ω, or ω². Wait, but if ω = 1, then the denominators become 1 + 1 = 2, so the expression would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is ω or ω², then we need to compute the expression. Wait, but if ω is 1, then the expression is 1, but if ω is a primitive root, maybe it's also 1? But maybe there's a difference.\n\nWait, let's check when ω = 1. Then the expression is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root (ω ≠ 1), then we have to compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). But as per my previous calculation, that also equals 1. So regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive root, the expression equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"all possible values,\" so maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me take ω = e^(2πi/3) which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2. Let's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo 1/(1 + ω) is 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n1/(1/2 + i√3/2) * (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2 - i√3/2) / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / (1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nAdding these two results: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1. So yes, that's 1. So even when ω is a primitive root, the expression is 1.\n\nIf ω = 1, then as before, the expression is 1. So regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values,\" and maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that ω and ω² are conjugates, so maybe when adding their reciprocals, the imaginary parts cancel out. But in the calculation above, when I computed both terms, they indeed added up to a real number, 1. So regardless of ω being 1, ω, or ω², the expression is always 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Wait, but the problem states \"niech ω будет liczbą zbióroną taką, что ω³ = 1.\" Which is \"Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1.\" So ω can be any of the three cube roots of unity. So if we take all three possibilities, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using polynomial division or another identity.\n\nAlternatively, since ω³ = 1, then ω³ - 1 = 0, which factors as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So if ω ≠ 1, then ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Which we already know.\n\nSo, if ω ≠ 1, then ω + ω² = -1. So maybe we can use that to compute the expression.\n\nLet me write E = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's combine these fractions:\n\nE = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nAs before, numerator: 2 + ω + ω². Denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. Since ω³ = 1, denominator is 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = (1 + ω + ω²) + 1. But 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so denominator is 0 + 1 = 1. Numerator: 2 + (-1) = 1. So E = 1/1 = 1. So even if ω is 1, let's check:\n\nIf ω = 1, then denominator (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = (2)(2) = 4. Numerator: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. So E = 4/4 = 1. Wait, but earlier when I computed with ω = 1, I thought the expression was 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Wait, actually, if ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So both approaches give 1. Therefore, regardless of ω being 1, ω, or ω², the expression E is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"all possible values,\" so maybe the answer is just 1. But maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, let's suppose that ω is a root of the equation x³ - 1 = 0. Then, as before, we have 1 + ω + ω² = 0. So if we take ω = ω, then ω² = -1 - ω. So substituting into E:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-1 - ω)) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(-ω) = 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.\n\nBut maybe this approach complicates things. Let's compute this:\n\n1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω = [ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)] = [ω -1 - ω] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1)/[ω(1 + ω)]\n\nBut 1 + ω = -ω², since 1 + ω + ω² = 0 => 1 + ω = -ω². So substituting that in:\n\n(-1)/[ω*(-ω²)] = (-1)/(-ω³) = (-1)/(-1) = 1, since ω³ = 1. Therefore, E = 1. So again, this approach gives 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that when ω = 1, the expression is 1. Let's verify numerically. If ω = 1, then:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nIf ω is a primitive root, like ω = e^(2πi/3), then as computed earlier, the expression is 1. So regardless of ω being 1 or a primitive root, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega\\) can be any of the cube roots of unity: \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), or \\(\\omega^2\\). The cube roots of unity satisfy the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\) and \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\).\n\nWe start by considering the expression:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nTo combine these fractions, we find a common denominator:\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3\n\\]\nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the numerator:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega) = (1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\nUsing the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we substitute \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\):\n\\[\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe verify this result for all possible values of \\(\\omega\\):\n- If \\(\\omega = 1\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\).\n- If \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive root (i.e., \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)), we use the identity \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\) to confirm the numerator and denominator calculations, leading to the same result \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore, regardless of the value of \\(\\omega\\) (whether \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), or \\(\\omega^2\\)), the expression always evaluates to \\(1\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "1"}

So, we have four points A, B, C, D with some given distances between them, and we need to find the shortest possible route starting at any of the points A, B, C, or D, then visiting the other three exactly once each, and returning to the starting point? Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"odwiedzando remaining three points exactly once.\" Hmm, maybe it's a traveling salesman problem where you start at any point, visit the other three exactly once, and then the distance is from the starting point back to the ending point? Or is it a closed tour visiting all four points but starting at any of them? Wait, let's check the original problem statement again.\n\n\"Jaka jest najkrótsza odległość, которую można pokonać, zachodząc w dowolny точку A, B, C jest D, i odwiedzando remaining three points exactly once?\"\n\nSo, starting at any of the points A, B, C, or D, and then visiting the remaining three exactly once each. The question is about the shortest possible total distance of such a route.\n\nWait, but if we start at a point, visit the other three, and then return to the starting point, that would be a closed tour. But maybe the problem is just visiting the other three points in any order, and the total distance is from start to end? But the wording is \"odwiedzando remaining three points exactly once,\" which sounds like visiting each of the other three once. So, maybe it's an open tour starting at any point, visiting the other three exactly once each, and the distance is the sum of the legs of the tour. So, for example, if you start at A, go to B, then to C, then to D, that's three legs: AB + BC + CD. Similarly, starting at D, going to A, then to B, then to C: DA + AB + BC. Wait, but the problem says \"odwiedzando remaining three points exactly once,\" so maybe it's a path that starts at any point, visits the other three exactly once, and the total distance is the sum of those three edges. So, it's a traveling salesman problem where you can start anywhere, visit the other three in any order, and the total distance is the sum of the three edges. Then, we need to find the minimal such total distance.\n\nBut let me check the Asymptote code given. The Asymptote code draws some lines between the points. Let me parse that. The code defines points A, B, C, D with coordinates:\n\nA = (-3,3)\nB = (3,0)\nC = (0, -4)\nD = (0,0)\n\nThen, some edges are drawn with labels:\n\ndraw(D--B--C--cycle); draw(D--A--B--cycle); draw(D--A--C--cycle);\n\nSo, D is connected to B, B is connected to C, forming a triangle D-B-C. Also, D is connected to A, A is connected to B, forming a triangle D-A-B. Also, D is connected to A, A is connected to C, forming a triangle D-A-C. Then, the labels on the edges are:\n\nlabel(\"3\", D--B, S); So, the edge DB is length 3.\n\nlabel(\"6\", A--B, NE); So, edge AB is 6.\n\nlabel(\"6\", A--C, SW); Edge AC is 6.\n\nlabel(\"4\", D--C, NW+N); Edge DC is 4.\n\nlabel(\"5\", A--D, SE+NE); Edge AD is 5.\n\nlabel(\"5\", C--B, E); Edge CB is 5.\n\nWait, so let's list all the given distances:\n\nAB = 6\n\nAC = 6\n\nAD = 5\n\nBC = 5\n\nBD = 3\n\nCD = 4\n\nAlso, there's a triangle D-A-C with edges DA=5, AC=6, DC=4.\n\nBut also, triangles D-B-C: DB=3, BC=5, DC=4. So, triangle with sides 3,4,5? Wait, 3-4-5 is a right triangle. Let me confirm: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². So, triangle D-B-C is a right triangle with right angle at D. Because DB=3, DC=4, BC=5. So, yes, right triangle.\n\nSimilarly, triangle D-A-B: DA=5, AB=6, DB=3. Let's check if that's a valid triangle. 3 + 5 > 6? 8 > 6, yes. 3 + 6 > 5? 9 > 5. 5 + 6 > 3? 11 > 3. So, yes. Not a right triangle, though.\n\nSimilarly, triangle D-A-C: DA=5, AC=6, DC=4. 5 + 4 > 6, 9 > 6. 5 + 6 > 4, 11 > 4. 4 + 6 > 5, 10 > 5. So, valid.\n\nSo, given that, the distances between all pairs are:\n\nAB=6\n\nAC=6\n\nAD=5\n\nBC=5\n\nBD=3\n\nCD=4\n\nSo, the problem is to find the shortest route starting at any of the four points, visiting the other three exactly once, and returning to the starting point? Wait, no, the problem says \"odwiedzando remaining three points exactly once.\" So, it's an open tour: starting at any point, visiting the other three in some order, and the total distance is the sum of the three edges. So, for example, starting at A, going to B, then to C, then to D: total distance AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nWait, but if you start at D, for example, and go to A, then to B, then to C: DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16. That's longer. If you start at D and go to B, then to C, then to A: DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14. Wait, that's shorter. Wait, but starting at D, going to B, then to C, then to A: total distance 3 + 5 + 6 = 14. That's shorter than starting at A or D. But maybe starting at C?\n\nStarting at C, going to B, then to A, then to D: CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16. Hmm. Starting at C, going to A, then to D, then to B: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14. That's also 14. Starting at B: BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. Starting at B, going to D, then to C, then to A: BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. Wait, BD is 3, DC is 4, CA is 6. So 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. That's even shorter. Starting at B, go to D, then to C, then to A: total distance 13.\n\nStarting at A: AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. Starting at A, another path: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. Wait, starting at A, go to C, then D, then B: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. So that's also 13.\n\nStarting at C: CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16. Starting at C, another path: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14. Hmm.\n\nSo, the minimal distance we found so far is 13, achieved by starting at B and going B-D-C-A, or starting at A and going A-C-D-B, or starting at A and going A-D-B-C? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, starting at A, going to C, then D, then B: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. Yes, that's 13.\n\nStarting at B, going to D, then C, then A: BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. Yes, that's 13.\n\nSo, both starting at A and B can achieve 13. Is there a shorter path?\n\nWait, let's check all possible permutations. Since there are 4 starting points, and from each starting point, 3! = 6 possible routes, but since the starting point is fixed, we need to consider all permutations of the other three points. However, since the graph is undirected, some routes might be duplicates. Let me list all possible paths for each starting point and calculate their total distances.\n\nStarting at A:\n\nPossible permutations of B, C, D:\n\n1. B-C-D: AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\n2. B-D-C: AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\n3. C-B-D: AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\n4. C-D-B: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\n5. D-B-C: AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\n6. D-C-B: AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\n\nSo starting at A, the minimal distance is 13.\n\nStarting at B:\n\nPermutations of A, C, D:\n\n1. A-C-D: BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\n2. A-D-C: BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\n3. C-A-D: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\n4. C-D-A: CA + CD + DA = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15\n5. D-A-C: DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\n6. D-C-A: DB + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n\nStarting at B, minimal distance is 13.\n\nStarting at C:\n\nPermutations of A, B, D:\n\n1. A-B-D: CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\n2. A-D-B: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\n3. B-A-D: CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\n4. B-D-A: CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\n5. D-A-B: DA + AD + DB = 5 + 5 + 3 = 13\n6. D-B-A: DA + DB + BA = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14\n\nStarting at C, minimal distance is 13.\n\nStarting at D:\n\nPermutations of A, B, C:\n\n1. A-B-C: DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\n2. A-C-B: DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\n3. B-A-C: DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\n4. B-C-A: DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\n5. C-A-B: DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\n6. C-B-A: DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n\nStarting at D, the minimal distance is 14.\n\nSo, across all starting points, the minimal distance is 13. So, the answer should be 13. But let me verify once again.\n\nLooking at the path starting at A: A-C-D-B (AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13). Starting at B: B-D-C-A (BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13). Starting at C: C-D-A-B (CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15? Wait, no. Wait, starting at C, the minimal path is C-D-A-B: CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15? Wait, no. Wait, when starting at C, going to D, then to A, then to B: CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. But earlier, starting at C, permutation D-A-B: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14. So that's a better path. Wait, starting at C, going to A, then D, then B: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14. Yes, that's correct. So that's 14. So starting at C, minimal is 14. So the minimal is 13, achieved by starting at A or B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible distance is 13. So, the answer should be \\boxed{13}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), or \\(D\\) and visiting the remaining three points exactly once each, we need to consider all possible routes and their total distances.
