Since \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{CD}\\), \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is the height of \\(\\triangle ACD\\).\n\nThe area of trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) is given by:\n\\[\n[ABCD] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h = 42\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n(a + b) \\times h = 84\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\). Since \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is the height of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) and \\(CD = h\\), the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is:\n\\[\n[\\triangle ACD] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times CD \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times h \\times AC\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) have the same height \\(AC\\) and the base of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is \\(CD = h\\).

The area of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is:\n\\[\n[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times AC\n\\]\n\nThe area of trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) is the sum of the areas of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) and \\(\\triangle ABC\\):\n\\[\n[ABCD] = [\\triangle ACD] + [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times h \\times AC + \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times (h + b)\n\\]\n\nWe already know that \\((a + b) \\times h = 84\\). Since \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), the height \\(AC\\) is the same for both triangles, and the sum of the bases of the triangles is \\(a + b\\).

Since \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), the areas of \\(\\triangle ACD\\) and \\(\\triangle ABC\\) are in the ratio of their bases \\(CD\\) and \\(BC\\), which is \\(h : b\\).

Therefore, \\(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\\) is always true for all real numbers \\(x\\).\n\nNext, consider the inequality \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\). We can rewrite this inequality as:\n\\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\\]\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then the inequality becomes:\n\\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\\]\nWe need to factor the quadratic expression \\(y^2 + 4y - 21\\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-21\\) and add up to \\(4\\).

Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\\]\nTo solve the inequality \\((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\\), we need to determine the intervals where the product is negative. The roots of the equation \\((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\\) are \\(y = -7\\) and \\(y = 3\\).
