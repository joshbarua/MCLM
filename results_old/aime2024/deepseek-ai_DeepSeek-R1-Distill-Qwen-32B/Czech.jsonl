Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find.\n\nFirst, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a café. When she walks at a constant speed of \\( s \\) km/h, the whole thing takes her 4 hours, which includes \\( t \\) minutes spent at the café. Then, when she walks a bit faster, at \\( s + 2 \\) km/h, the whole trip takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same \\( t \\) minutes at the café. I need to find out how long her walk would take if she walks at \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\) km/h, including the café time.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's break this down. The total time she spends is the time walking plus the time at the café. So, for the first scenario, walking at \\( s \\) km/h, the time walking is \\( \\frac{9}{s} \\) hours, right? Because time equals distance divided by speed. Then, she spends \\( t \\) minutes at the café. But the total time is given as 4 hours. Wait, but \\( t \\) is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours to keep the units consistent.\n\nSo, \\( t \\) minutes is \\( \\frac{t}{60} \\) hours. Therefore, the equation for the first scenario is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, she walks at \\( s + 2 \\) km/h, so the walking time is \\( \\frac{9}{s + 2} \\) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours because 24 divided by 60 is 0.4. So, the total time is 2.4 hours. So, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s + 2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4\n\\]\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{9}{s + 2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \\)\n\nI can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\( \\frac{t}{60} \\). Let's do that:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{9}{s + 2} + \\frac{t}{60} \\right) = 4 - 2.4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6\n\\]\n\nSo, that's:\n\n\\[\n9 \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + 2} \\right) = 1.6\n\\]\n\nLet me compute \\( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + 2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(s + 2) - s}{s(s + 2)} = \\frac{2}{s(s + 2)}\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times \\frac{2}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6\n\\]\n\nLet me write 1.6 as a fraction to make it easier. 1.6 is the same as \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = \\frac{8}{5}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n18 \\times 5 = 8 \\times s(s + 2)\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n90 = 8s^2 + 16s\n\\]\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. Let me see if I can simplify it. All coefficients are even, so divide by 2:\n\n\\[\n4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( s \\) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is \\( 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0 \\). So, \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 8 \\), \\( c = -45 \\).\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times (-45)}}{2 \\times 4}\n\\]\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n\\[\n64 - 4 \\times 4 \\times (-45) = 64 + 720 = 784\n\\]\n\nSquare root of 784 is 28. So,\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-8 \\pm 28}{8}\n\\]\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\n1. \\( s = \\frac{-8 + 28}{8} = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \\) km/h\n2. \\( s = \\frac{-8 - 28}{8} = \\frac{-36}{8} = -4.5 \\) km/h\n\nSince speed can't be negative, we discard the negative solution. So, \\( s = 2.5 \\) km/h.\n\nNow, let's find \\( t \\). Let's use the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\( s = 2.5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\nCompute \\( \\frac{9}{2.5} \\). 2.5 goes into 9 three times with a remainder. 2.5 * 3 = 7.5, so 9 - 7.5 = 1.5. So, 1.5 / 2.5 = 0.6. So, total is 3.6.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n3.6 + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\nSubtract 3.6:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 60:\n\n\\[\nt = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 24 \\) minutes.\n\nNow, the question is, if Aya walks at \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\) km/h, which is \\( 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \\) km/h, how much time will the whole trip take, including the 24 minutes at the café.\n\nFirst, compute the walking time. Distance is 9 km, speed is 3 km/h, so time is \\( \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nConvert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nAdd the café time: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"najděte počet minut, které jí procházka zabere, včetně \\( t \\) minut strávených v kavárně.\" So, it's the total time in minutes, including the café time.\n\nSo, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes at the café, so total is 204 minutes.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me verify the value of \\( s \\).\n\nWe had \\( s = 2.5 \\) km/h. So, walking 9 km at 2.5 km/h takes \\( 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 \\) hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Then, adding 24 minutes at the café, total time is 3h36m + 24m = 4 hours, which matches the first condition.\n\nSimilarly, walking at \\( s + 2 = 4.5 \\) km/h, time is \\( 9 / 4.5 = 2 \\) hours, which is 120 minutes. Adding 24 minutes, total time is 144 minutes, which is 2 hours and 24 minutes, matching the second condition.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, walking at 3 km/h, time is 3 hours walking plus 24 minutes café, total 204 minutes.\n\nWait, but 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204. So, 204 minutes.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"najděte počet minut, které jí procházka zabere, včetně \\( t \\) minut strávených v kavárně.\" So, it's the total time, including the café. So, yes, 204 minutes.\n\nBut let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The first time, walking at \\( s \\), total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, walking time is 240 - 24 = 216 minutes. 216 minutes is 3.6 hours, which is 9 / 2.5, correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second time, total time is 2h24m = 144 minutes. So, walking time is 144 - 24 = 120 minutes, which is 2 hours, and 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours, correct.\n\nSo, when she walks at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes, total 204 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be 204 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n18 = 1.6 s(s + 2)\n\\]\n\nWait, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 = (8/5)s(s + 2). Multiply both sides by 5:\n\n90 = 8s(s + 2)\n\nWhich is 8s² + 16s - 90 = 0, which simplifies to 4s² + 8s - 45 = 0.\n\nQuadratic formula: s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8 = [-8 ± 28]/8.\n\nSo, positive solution is 20/8 = 2.5, correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the total time is 204 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total time Aya spends on her walk and café visit at the new speed is \\boxed{204} minutes.\n</think>\n\nAya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a café.

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nWe have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting A to D, which intersects the circle again at P. We need to find AP.\n\nI remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, since D is the point where the two tangents meet, DB and DC should be equal in length. That might be useful.\n\nAlso, since ABC is inscribed in a circle, maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or something related to power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² or DC², since they are tangents. \n\nLet me recall the power of a point theorem. It states that for a point D outside a circle, the power is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle. So, Power(D) = DB² = DC². Also, if a line through D intersects the circle at two points, say A and P, then Power(D) = DA * DP. \n\nSo, in this case, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, we have DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful because if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA, I can find AP.\n\nBut wait, actually, AP is from A to P, so if AD is from A to D, and P is on AD beyond A, then AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think.\n\nActually, point D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that passes through the circle, entering at A and exiting at P. So, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DA * DP. So, Power(D) = DA * DP = DB².\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then AP would be DP - DA? Wait, no, because AP is from A to P, which is along AD. So, if D is outside, and A is on the circle, then AD is a secant where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, which is DP - DA? Wait, no, that would be negative. Maybe I need to think in terms of directed lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the power of point D: DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA, but I need to be careful with the signs.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of lengths, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Since P is on the circle, and A is also on the circle, but D is outside, so DP is longer than DA. So, AP would be DP - DA. But let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates or trigonometry. But before jumping into that, let me see if I can find DA somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use triangle properties. Since ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10, perhaps I can compute some angles or other lengths.\n\nWait, let me compute the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC first. The sides are 5, 9, 10. So, semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nThen, using Heron's formula, the area of triangle ABC is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504, but 31.5 is not an integer. Let me factor 504 properly.\n\n504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but 504 is 7*72, which is 7*8*9, so 504 = 7*8*9 = 7*72. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*72) = sqrt(7*36*2) = 6*sqrt(14). So, area is 6√14.\n\nOkay, so area is 6√14. Maybe that can help us find the circumradius.\n\nI remember that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle is (a*b*c)/(4*Area). So, R = (AB * BC * AC)/(4 * Area) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.\n\nSo, R = 75√14 / 56. Hmm, that's the circumradius.\n\nBut how does that help me? Maybe I can find the length DA somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (5, 0), since AB is 5. Then, point C is somewhere in the plane such that AC is 10 and BC is 9. Let me find the coordinates of point C.\n\nSo, coordinates of A: (0, 0), coordinates of B: (5, 0). Let me denote coordinates of C as (x, y). Then, distance from A to C is 10: sqrt(x² + y²) = 10, so x² + y² = 100.\n\nDistance from B to C is 9: sqrt((x - 5)² + y²) = 9, so (x - 5)² + y² = 81.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 5)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 81 - 100 => x² -10x +25 + y² - x² - y² = -19 => -10x +25 = -19 => -10x = -44 => x = 4.4.\n\nSo, x = 4.4, which is 22/5. Then, from x² + y² = 100, we have (22/5)² + y² = 100 => (484/25) + y² = 100 => y² = 100 - 484/25 = (2500 - 484)/25 = 2016/25. So, y = sqrt(2016/25) = (sqrt(2016))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(2016): 2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 14. So, sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(14) = 12√14. Therefore, y = 12√14 / 5.\n\nSo, coordinates of C are (22/5, 12√14/5). Okay, so now I have coordinates for A, B, C.\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in the coordinates of A, B, C:\n\nFor A(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nFor B(5,0): 25 + 0 + 5D + 0 + F = 0. Since F=0, 25 + 5D = 0 => 5D = -25 => D = -5.\n\nFor C(22/5, 12√14/5): (22/5)² + (12√14/5)² + D*(22/5) + E*(12√14/5) + F = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(22/5)² = 484/25.\n\n(12√14/5)² = (144*14)/25 = 2016/25.\n\nD = -5, so D*(22/5) = (-5)*(22/5) = -22.\n\nE*(12√14/5) remains as is.\n\nF = 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n484/25 + 2016/25 - 22 + (12√14/5)E = 0.\n\nCompute 484 + 2016 = 2500, so 2500/25 = 100.\n\nSo, 100 - 22 + (12√14/5)E = 0 => 78 + (12√14/5)E = 0 => (12√14/5)E = -78 => E = (-78 * 5)/(12√14) = (-390)/(12√14) = (-65)/(2√14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-65√14)/(2*14) = (-65√14)/28.\n\nSo, E = -65√14 / 28.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle ω is x² + y² -5x - (65√14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but okay.\n\nNow, we need to find the equations of the tangents from D to ω at points B and C. Wait, but we don't know where D is yet. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So, if I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D, then find the equation of line AD, find its intersection with ω again at P, and then compute AP.\n\nThis seems like a plan, but it's going to involve a lot of computations. Let me see if I can proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nFor a circle given by x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the equation of the tangent at a point (x₁, y₁) on the circle is xx₁ + yy₁ + D(x + x₁)/2 + E(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. The equation of the tangent to a circle at point (x₁, y₁) is given by:\n\n(x₁)(x) + (y₁)(y) + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, for our circle, D = -5, E = -65√14/28, F = 0.\n\nSo, the tangent at point B(5, 0):\n\nx₁ = 5, y₁ = 0.\n\nSo, equation is 5x + 0*y + (-5)*(x + 5)/2 + (-65√14/28)*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n5x - (5/2)(x + 5) - (65√14/56)y = 0.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n5x - (5x/2 + 25/2) - (65√14/56)y = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5x - 5x/2 = (10x - 5x)/2 = 5x/2.\n\nSo, 5x/2 - 25/2 - (65√14/56)y = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5x/2 *56 = 140x,\n\n-25/2 *56 = -700,\n\n- (65√14/56)y *56 = -65√14 y.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n140x - 700 - 65√14 y = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n140x - 65√14 y = 700.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 5:\n\n28x - 13√14 y = 140.\n\nSo, that's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at C(22/5, 12√14/5).\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nx₁ = 22/5, y₁ = 12√14/5.\n\nEquation: (22/5)x + (12√14/5)y + (-5)*(x + 22/5)/2 + (-65√14/28)*(y + 12√14/5)/2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (22/5)x.\n\nSecond term: (12√14/5)y.\n\nThird term: (-5)*(x + 22/5)/2 = (-5/2)x - (5/2)*(2", "answer": "113"}

Jaká je hodnota $m+n$?", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's a rotation which maps all blue vertices to where the red ones were. So, if I rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's regular, each rotation is 360/8 = 45 degrees), the blue vertices should align with the red ones.\n\nWait, so if I rotate the octagon by k positions, then each vertex moves to the position k steps away. For the coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist some rotation k such that every blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red. That means, for each blue vertex at position i, after rotation by k, it should be at position i + k (mod 8), and that position should have been red originally.\n\nBut hold on, if I rotate the octagon, the colors themselves don't change; only their positions do. So, if I rotate the octagon, the blue vertices will move to new positions, and we want those new positions to coincide with the original red vertices. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.\n\nBut since the octagon is regular, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the coloring must be such that the blue vertices form a rotated version of the red vertices.\n\nWait, but the red and blue vertices are complements of each other. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set is also a rotation of the blue set. So, the coloring must be such that the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices, which is the same as saying that the coloring is rotationally symmetric in some way.\n\nBut how does that translate into the number of such colorings?\n\nLet me think. For a given coloring, if there exists a rotation k such that rotating the blue vertices by k positions results in the red vertices, then the coloring is counted. So, for each possible rotation k (from 0 to 7), we can check if rotating the blue set by k gives the red set.\n\nBut since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to the cyclic group of order 8. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.\n\nBut since the red and blue sets are complements, this is equivalent to the blue set being a rotation of its own complement. So, the blue set must be a fixed point under some rotation.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that after some rotation, the blue vertices coincide with the red vertices. That means that the blue set is equal to the red set rotated by k positions. But since the red set is the complement of the blue set, this implies that the blue set is equal to the complement of the blue set rotated by k positions.\n\nSo, in other words, B = R rotated by k, but R is the complement of B, so B = (complement of B) rotated by k. Therefore, B rotated by k is equal to the complement of B.\n\nSo, B rotated by k = complement of B.\n\nWhich implies that B union (B rotated by k) is the entire set of vertices, and B intersect (B rotated by k) is empty.\n\nSo, for each vertex, it is either in B or in B rotated by k, but not both.\n\nTherefore, the coloring must be such that the blue set and its rotation by k are disjoint and their union is the entire set.\n\nSo, for some k, the blue set is a derangement of itself under rotation by k, such that no blue vertex maps to another blue vertex.\n\nWait, that might be a bit abstract. Maybe I should think in terms of group actions.\n\nThe group here is the cyclic group C8 acting on the set of colorings. We are looking for colorings where the blue set is a translate (under rotation) of the red set. Since red and blue are complements, this is equivalent to the blue set being a translate of its own complement.\n\nSo, for some rotation k, B = R + k (mod 8). But R is the complement of B, so B = (complement of B) + k.\n\nTherefore, B union (B + k) = entire set, and B intersect (B + k) = empty set.\n\nSo, each vertex is in exactly one of B or B + k.\n\nTherefore, the coloring is such that the blue set is a \"shifted\" version of its complement.\n\nThis seems similar to a concept in combinatorics called \"complementary sets under rotation.\" Maybe I can model this as a necklace with beads colored red and blue, and we want necklaces where the blue beads are a rotation of the red beads.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of binary strings of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue), and we want the number of binary strings where the set of 1s is a rotation of the set of 0s.\n\nBut since the set of 1s is the complement of the set of 0s, this is equivalent to the set of 1s being a rotation of its own complement.\n\nSo, how many such binary strings are there?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as the number of binary necklaces where the necklace is equal to its complement under some rotation.\n\nWait, that might be a useful perspective. A necklace is an equivalence class under rotation, so if a necklace is equal to its complement under some rotation, then it satisfies the condition.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because we are considering all possible colorings, not just necklaces.\n\nWait, perhaps Burnside's lemma can be used here. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits under a group action to the average number of fixed points.\n\nBut in this case, we are not directly counting orbits, but rather colorings with certain properties. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the red set is the complement of the blue set, this is equivalent to the blue set being a rotation of its complement.\n\nSo, for each possible rotation k (from 1 to 7, since k=0 would just be the identity, which would require the blue set to be equal to its complement, which is only possible if the blue set is empty or full, but since each vertex is colored independently, the only such colorings are all red or all blue, which are two colorings. But in our case, we need to consider all possible k, including k=0.\n\nWait, but if k=0, then B = R, which would mean that the blue set is equal to the red set, which is only possible if the blue set is empty or full, as the red set is the complement. So, only two colorings: all red or all blue.\n\nBut for k=1 to 7, we have non-trivial rotations.\n\nSo, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where B = R + k is equal to the number of colorings where B is a rotation of its complement.\n\nBut how do we count that?\n\nAlternatively, for each k, the number of colorings where B is equal to R + k is equal to the number of colorings where B union (B + k) is the entire set, and B intersect (B + k) is empty.\n\nWhich is equivalent to B being a set such that when you rotate it by k, you get its complement.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of such B is equal to the number of subsets B of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} such that B + k = complement of B.\n\nSo, for each k, how many subsets B satisfy B + k = complement of B.\n\nLet me fix a k and count the number of such B.\n\nNote that if B + k = complement of B, then applying the rotation k again, we get (B + k) + k = complement of (B + k) = complement of (complement of B) = B.\n\nSo, B + 2k = B.\n\nTherefore, B is invariant under rotation by 2k.\n\nSo, B must be a union of orbits under rotation by 2k.\n\nBut since the group is cyclic of order 8, the orbits under rotation by d (where d is the gcd of 2k and 8) will have size 8/d.\n\nSo, the number of such B is 2^{number of orbits}.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf B is invariant under rotation by 2k, then B is a union of orbits under the subgroup generated by rotation 2k.\n\nThe number of orbits is equal to the number of cycles in the rotation by 2k, which is gcd(2k, 8).\n\nWait, no, the number of orbits is equal to the number of cycles, which is gcd(2k, 8). So, the number of orbits is d, where d = gcd(2k, 8).\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets B invariant under rotation by 2k is 2^d.\n\nBut in our case, B must satisfy B + k = complement of B.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of such B is equal to the number of subsets invariant under rotation by 2k, which is 2^{gcd(2k,8)}.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because B must satisfy B + k = complement of B, which implies that B is invariant under rotation by 2k, but also that B and its complement are related by rotation k.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of such B is equal to the number of subsets invariant under rotation by 2k, but also satisfying B + k = complement of B.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of linear algebra.\n\nLet me represent the set B as a binary vector in Z_2^8, where each coordinate is 1 if the vertex is blue, 0 otherwise.\n\nThen, the condition B + k = complement of B can be written as B + k = 1 - B, where 1 is the all-ones vector.\n\nSo, in Z_2^8, this is equivalent to B + k = 1 + B, which implies that k = 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because k is a rotation, not a vector.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nIn Z_2^8, the rotation by k can be represented as a cyclic shift. So, if we denote the rotation operator as R_k, then R_k(B) = B + k.\n\nBut in Z_2, addition is modulo 2, so R_k(B) = B shifted by k positions.\n\nBut the condition is R_k(B) = 1 - B, where 1 is the all-ones vector.\n\nSo, R_k(B) + B = 1.\n\nSo, in Z_2^8, this is a linear equation: R_k(B) + B = 1.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of solutions B to this equation is either 0 or 2^{8 - rank}, where rank is the rank of the operator R_k + I, where I is the identity operator.\n\nBut this might be getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of B such that R_k(B) = 1 - B is equal to 2^{8 - d}, where d is the dimension of the space.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the equation R_k(B) + B = 1.\n\nThis is a linear equation over Z_2^8. The number of solutions is either 0 or 2^{8 - rank}, depending on whether 1 is in the column space of the matrix R_k + I.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of such B is either 0 or 1, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. Let k=1.\n\nSo, R_1(B) = B shifted by 1. The equation is R_1(B) + B = 1.\n\nLet me write this out for each position.\n\nLet B = (b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7).\n\nThen, R_1(B) = (b7, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6).\n\nSo, R_1(B) + B = (b7 + b0, b0 + b1, b1 + b2, b2 + b3, b3 + b4, b4 + b5, b5 + b6, b6 + b7) = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1).\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\nb7 + b0 = 1\n\nb0 + b1 = 1\n\nb1 + b2 = 1\n\nb2 + b3 = 1\n\nb3 + b4 = 1\n\nb4 + b5 = 1\n\nb5 + b6 = 1\n\nb6 + b7 = 1\n\nThis is a system of 8 equations with 8 variables.\n\nLet me try to solve this.\n\nFrom the first equation: b0 = 1 + b7\n\nFrom the second equation: b1 = 1 + b0 = 1 + (1 + b7) = b7\n\nFrom the third equation: b2 = 1 + b1 = 1 + b7\n\nFrom the fourth equation: b3 = 1 + b2 = 1 + (1 + b7) = b7\n\nFrom the fifth equation: b4 = 1 + b3 = 1 + b7\n\nFrom the sixth equation: b5 = 1 + b4 = 1 + (1 + b7) = b7\n\nFrom the seventh equation: b6 = 1 + b5 = 1 + b7\n\nFrom the eighth equation: b7 = 1 + b6 = 1 + (1 + b7) = b7\n\nSo, from the eighth equation: b7 = 1 + 1 + b7 => 0 = 0, which is always true.\n\nSo, the system is consistent, and we have one free variable, which is b7.\n\nSo, b7 can be either 0 or 1.\n\nIf b7 = 0:\n\nb0 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nb1 = 0\n\nb2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nb3 = 0\n\nb4 =", "answer": "371"}

The functions given are a bit complicated, but let me try to break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the functions again to make sure I have them right:\n\n- \\( f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\)\n- \\( g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\)\n\nAnd the two equations we're looking at are:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nSo, I need to find all points \\((x, y)\\) where these two equations are satisfied simultaneously. That means I need to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that both equations hold true.\n\nLet me start by understanding the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). Both are absolute value functions, which usually create V-shaped graphs. Let me sketch or at least visualize what \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) look like.\n\nStarting with \\(f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\). The inner absolute value \\(|x|\\) makes the function symmetric about the y-axis. Then subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) shifts it down by 0.5 units, and then taking the absolute value again will reflect any negative parts back up. So, the graph of \\(f(x)\\) will have a V-shape with its vertex at \\(x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\), right?\n\nSimilarly, \\(g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\) will also be symmetric about the y-axis. The inner absolute value \\(|x|\\) is shifted down by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), and then the outer absolute value reflects any negative parts. So, the vertex of \\(g(x)\\) will be at \\(x = \\pm \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the compositions. Let's first analyze \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\). Since \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\) is a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. So, \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) will take the sine wave, pass it through the function \\(f\\), which as we saw earlier, is a V-shaped graph centered at \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) will take the output of \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) and pass it through \\(g\\), which is another V-shaped function centered at \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{4}\\). Then, this result is multiplied by 4 in the first equation.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))\\) is a cosine function with period \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, \\(g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\) is passed through \\(g\\), and multiplied by 4.\n\nSo, both equations are transformations of sine and cosine functions, composed with these absolute value functions, scaled by 4.\n\nI think the key here is to analyze the ranges of these functions and see where they can intersect.\n\nLet me first find the range of \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\), the inner \\(|x|\\) is always non-negative. So, \\(|x| - \\frac{1}{2}\\) can be negative or non-negative. Taking the absolute value, \\(f(x)\\) will have a minimum value of 0 when \\(|x| = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and it will increase as \\(|x|\\) moves away from \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). So, the range of \\(f(x)\\) is \\([0, \\infty)\\), but since \\(f(x)\\) is applied to \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\) and \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\), which are bounded between -1 and 1, the input to \\(f\\) is between 0 and 1 (since \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) outputs are between -1 and 1, but \\(|x|\\) makes it non-negative). So, \\(f\\) will take inputs from 0 to 1.\n\nLet me compute \\(f(t)\\) where \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1. So, \\(f(t) = |t - 1/2|\\). So, when \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1/2, \\(f(t) = 1/2 - t\\), and when \\(t\\) is between 1/2 and 1, \\(f(t) = t - 1/2\\). So, the range of \\(f(t)\\) for \\(t \\in [0,1]\\) is [0, 1/2].\n\nSimilarly, \\(g(t)\\) is \\(|t - 1/4|\\). So, for \\(t\\) between 0 and 1/4, \\(g(t) = 1/4 - t\\), and for \\(t\\) between 1/4 and 1, \\(g(t) = t - 1/4\\). So, the range of \\(g(t)\\) for \\(t \\in [0,1]\\) is [0, 3/4].\n\nBut in our case, \\(g\\) is applied to \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) and \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))\\), which as we saw, have outputs in [0, 1/2]. So, the input to \\(g\\) is in [0, 1/2]. Therefore, \\(g(s)\\) where \\(s \\in [0, 1/2]\\) is \\(|s - 1/4|\\). So, when \\(s\\) is between 0 and 1/4, \\(g(s) = 1/4 - s\\), and when \\(s\\) is between 1/4 and 1/2, \\(g(s) = s - 1/4\\). Therefore, the range of \\(g(s)\\) for \\(s \\in [0, 1/2]\\) is [0, 1/4].\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) has a range of [0, 1/4], and when multiplied by 4, the first equation becomes \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\), which has a range of [0, 1].\n\nSimilarly, the second equation is \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\), which also has a range of [0, 1].\n\nSo, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are confined to the interval [0, 1]. That's a helpful restriction.\n\nNow, let's analyze the periodicity of both functions.\n\nFor the first equation, \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\). The inner function is \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\), which has a period of 1. So, as \\(x\\) increases by 1, the sine function completes a full cycle. Then, \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) will also have a period of 1, since it's just a transformation of the sine function. Similarly, \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) will also have a period of 1, and multiplying by 4 doesn't affect the period. So, the entire function \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) has a period of 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\). The inner function is \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\), which has a period of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). So, as \\(y\\) increases by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), the cosine function completes a full cycle. Then, \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))\\) will have the same period, and \\(g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\) will also have the same period. Multiplying by 4 doesn't change the period, so the entire function \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\) has a period of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the first equation is periodic with period 1, and the second equation is periodic with period \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). So, the system of equations is periodic in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but with different periods. This might complicate things, but perhaps we can analyze the behavior within a fundamental period and then see how it repeats.\n\nSince both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in [0,1], let's focus on the unit square [0,1] x [0,1]. Because of the periodicity, the number of intersections in this square will repeat in each subsequent period. So, if we can find the number of intersections in [0,1] x [0,1], that will give us the total number of intersections in the entire plane.\n\nSo, let's focus on \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) and \\(y \\in [0,1]\\).\n\nNow, let's try to understand the behavior of both functions within this interval.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step:\n\n1. Compute \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\). Since \\(x \\in [0,1]\\), \\(2\\pi x\\) goes from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\), so \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\) completes one full cycle, going from 0 up to 1, down to -1, and back to 0.\n\n2. Compute \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\). Since \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) is always non-negative, this becomes \\(| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} |\\). So, it's the absolute difference between \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n3. Then, compute \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) = \\left| f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\). So, it's the absolute difference between \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n4. Multiply by 4 to get \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\).\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Compute \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\). Since \\(y \\in [0,1]\\), \\(3\\pi y\\) goes from 0 to \\(3\\pi\\), so \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\) completes 1.5 cycles. It starts at 1, goes down to -1 at \\(y = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}\\), back to 1 at \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\), and then to -1 again at \\(y = 1\\).\n\n2. Compute \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) = \\left| |\\cos(3\\pi y)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\). Again, since \\(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|\\) is non-negative, this is the absolute difference between \\(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n3. Compute \\(g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) = \\left| f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\).\n\n4. Multiply by 4 to get \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\).\n\nSo, both equations are oscillating functions, but with different periods and different numbers of oscillations within the interval [0,1].\n\nTo find the number of intersections, I think I need to analyze how these two functions behave and how often they cross each other.\n\nLet me try to sketch or at least understand the behavior of both functions.\n\nStarting with \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\):\n\n- The inner function \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\) oscillates between -1 and 1 with period 1.\n- Taking absolute value, \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) oscillates between 0 and 1, with period 0.5 (since the absolute value makes the negative parts positive, effectively doubling the frequency).\n- Then, subtracting 1/2 and taking absolute value: \\(f(t) = |t - 1/2|\\). So, when \\(t\\) is less than 1/2, \\(f(t) = 1/2 - t\\), and when \\(t\\) is greater than 1/2, \\(f(t) = t - 1/2\\). So, the graph of \\(f(t)\\) is V-shaped with the vertex at \\(t = 1/2\\).\n- So, \\(f(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)\\) will have peaks where \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) is 1, which occurs at \\(x = 1/4, 3/4\\), etc., and will dip to 0 where \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1/2\\), which occurs at \\(x = 1/6, 1/3, 2/3, 5/6\\), etc.\n- Then, \\(g(f(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)) = |f(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|) - 1/4|\\). So, this will create another V-shape, subtracting 1/4 and taking absolute value. So, when \\(f(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)\\) is less than 1/4, \\(g\\) will be 1/4 - f(...), and when it's more than 1/4, it will be f(...) - 1/4.\n- Multiplying by 4, the function \\(y = 4g(f(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|))\\) will scale this up.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\):\n\n- The inner function \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\) oscillates between -1 and 1 with period \\(2/3\\).\n- Taking absolute value, \\(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|\\) oscillates between 0 and 1,", "answer": "385"}

Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. So, maybe I should start by checking these small primes to see if any of them satisfy the condition that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p² for some n.\n\nLet me start with p = 2. Then p² = 4. I need to check if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for different n:\n\n- If n is even, say n = 2k, then n⁴ = (2k)⁴ = 16k⁴, which is 0 mod 4. So n⁴ + 1 would be 1 mod 4, which is not divisible by 4.\n- If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then n⁴ = (2k + 1)⁴. Let's compute this modulo 4. (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, squaring that, (1)² = 1 mod 4. So n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4, and n⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which is also not divisible by 4.\n\nSo, for p = 2, there's no n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, p cannot be 2.\n\nNext, let's try p = 3. Then p² = 9. I need to find an n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9, which means n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers):\n\n- n = 1: 1⁴ = 1 mod 9\n- n = 2: 16 mod 9 = 7\n- n = 3: 81 mod 9 = 0\n- n = 4: 256 mod 9. Let's compute 256 / 9: 9*28=252, so 256 - 252 = 4. So 4 mod 9.\n- n = 5: 625 mod 9. 625 / 9: 9*69=621, so 625 - 621 = 4. So 4 mod 9.\n- n = 6: 1296 mod 9 = 0\n- n = 7: 7⁴ = 2401. 2401 / 9: 9*266=2394, so 2401 - 2394 = 7. So 7 mod 9.\n- n = 8: 4096 mod 9. Let's compute 4096 / 9: 9*455=4095, so 4096 - 4095 = 1. So 1 mod 9.\n\nLooking at these results, n⁴ mod 9 gives 0,1,4,7. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9 would mean n⁴ ≡ 8 mod 9, but none of the residues are 8. Therefore, there's no n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 9. So p = 3 is out.\n\nMoving on to p = 5. Then p² = 25. I need to find n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 25, which is n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24.\n\nBut that's a lot of computations. Maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that in modular arithmetic, the multiplicative order of n modulo p² can help. Since we're dealing with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25, that implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 25. So the order of n modulo 25 must divide 8. But the multiplicative group modulo 25 has order φ(25) = 20. So the order of n must divide both 8 and 20, which is 4. So the order is 4. Therefore, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 25, but we need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 25. So the order of n modulo 25 divides 8, but since φ(25)=20, the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4. So the order is 4. But if the order is 4, then n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 25, which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Therefore, there is no solution for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. So p = 5 is also out.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try p = 7. Then p² = 49. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 49, i.e., n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49.\n\nAgain, let's think about the multiplicative order. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 49. So the order of n modulo 49 divides 8. The multiplicative group modulo 49 has order φ(49)=42. So the order of n must divide gcd(8,42)=2. So the order is 2. But if the order is 2, then n² ≡ 1 mod 49, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 49, which again contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49. So no solution here either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of looking at the order, maybe I should just compute n⁴ mod 49 for some small n and see if any give -1 mod 49.\n\nLet's try n = 1: 1⁴ = 1 mod 49\nn = 2: 16 mod 49\nn = 3: 81 mod 49 = 81 - 49 = 32\nn = 4: 256 mod 49. 49*5=245, so 256 - 245 = 11\nn = 5: 625 mod 49. 49*12=588, 625 - 588 = 37\nn = 6: 1296 mod 49.

Let's compute 49*1704=83496, 83521 - 83496=25\nWait, that's the same as n=16? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check n=17:\n\n17²=289, 289 mod 49: 49*5=245, 289-245=44. Then 44²=1936. 1936 mod 49: 49*39=1911, 1936-1911=25. So yes, 17⁴ ≡25 mod49.\n\nn=18: 18²=324 mod49: 49*6=294, 324-294=30. 30²=900 mod49: 49*18=882, 900-882=18. So 18⁴≡18 mod49.\n\nn=19: 19²=361 mod49: 49*7=343, 361-343=18. 18²=324 mod49=30. So 19⁴≡30 mod49.\n\nn=20: 20²=400 mod49: 49*8=392, 400-392=8. 8²=64 mod49=15. So 20⁴≡15 mod49.\n\nn=21: 0 mod49.\n\nn=22: 22²=484 mod49: 49*9=441, 484-441=43. 43²=1849 mod49: 49*37=1813, 1849-1813=36. So 22⁴≡36 mod49.\n\nn=23: 23²=529 mod49: 49*10=490, 529-490=39. 39²=1521 mod49: 49*31=1519, 1521-1519=2. So 23⁴≡2 mod49.\n\nn=24: 24²=576 mod49: 49*11=539, 576-539=37. 37²=1369 mod49: 49*27=1323, 1369-1323=46. So 24⁴≡46 mod49.\n\nn=25: 25²=625 mod49: 49*12=588, 625-588=37. 37²=1369 mod49=46. So 25⁴≡46 mod49.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49, which is 48 mod49. So p=7 is also out.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to try a larger prime. Let's try p=13. Then p²=169. I need to find n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod169, i.e., n⁴ ≡ -1 mod169.\n\nThis might take a while, but let's see if there's a pattern or a smarter way. I remember that for primes p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue, but here we're dealing with quartic residues. Maybe p=17? Wait, let me check p=13 first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for primes where -1 is a quartic residue. I think that for primes p ≡1 mod8, -1 is a quartic residue. Let me check p=17, which is 1 mod8.\n\nWait, p=17: p²=289. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, maybe p=13 is 1 mod4 but not 1 mod8. Let me check p=13: 13 mod8=5, so not 1 mod8. Maybe p=17 is 1 mod8, so perhaps -1 is a quartic residue there.\n\nBut before that, let me check p=13. Let's compute n⁴ mod13 first to see if -", "answer": "110"}

The distance is given in the form m√n/p, and I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = √41\n- AC = BD = √80\n- BC = AD = √89\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges has the same length. That seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe this tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry? I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or sometimes a disphenoid. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron is symmetric, and all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, are they congruent?\n\nLet me check. Each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Let me verify if these can form congruent triangles.\n\nFor triangle ABC: sides AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80.\n\nSimilarly, triangle ABD: AB = √41, AD = √89, BD = √80.\n\nSo, yes, all faces are congruent triangles. That makes sense. So, this is a regular tetrahedron? Wait, no, a regular tetrahedron has all edges equal, but here edges are different. So, it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces. So, it's not regular, but it's still quite symmetrical.\n\nIn such a tetrahedron, I think the point I mentioned is the incenter, which is equidistant from all faces. So, the distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula is:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nwhere V is the volume, and S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume V and the total surface area S.\n\nFirst, let's compute the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Let me compute the area of one such triangle.\n\nI can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s is:\n\ns = (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2\n\nBut that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c:\n\nArea = (1/4) * √[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me denote a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(a + b + c) = √41 + √80 + √89\n\n(-a + b + c) = -√41 + √80 + √89\n\n(a - b + c) = √41 - √80 + √89\n\n(a + b - c) = √41 + √80 - √89\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates. Since the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the calculations are easier.\n\nLet me try to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. Since it's a disphenoid, I can place it such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something.\n\nWait, another approach: in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / (6*sqrt(2))\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should look for another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. That might be a good approach because it uses the edge lengths directly.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nV = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n[ 0   1    1    1    1  ]\n[ 1   0   a²   b²   c² ]\n[ 1  a²   0   d²   e² ]\n[ 1  b²  d²   0   f² ]\n[ 1  c²  e²  f²   0  ]\n\nSo, let me assign the edge lengths:\n\nAB = √41, so a² = 41\n\nAC = √80, so b² = 80\n\nAD = √89, so c² = 89\n\nBC = √89, so d² = 89\n\nBD = √80, so e² = 80\n\nCD = √41, so f² = 41\n\nSo, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\nCM = determinant of:\n\n[ 0   1    1    1    1  ]\n[ 1   0   41   80   89 ]\n[ 1  41    0   89   80 ]\n[ 1  80   89    0   41 ]\n[ 1  89   80   41    0 ]\n\nHmm, that's a 5x5 determinant. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 2: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 3: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 4: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 5: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nThis looks symmetric. Maybe I can compute this determinant step by step.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Maybe I can use some properties or simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, so the volume can be computed in another way.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8\n\nWait, no, that seems similar to the formula I thought earlier. Maybe I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by considering the coordinates.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nSince AB = √41, let me place B at (x, 0, 0). So, AB = x = √41, so x = √41.\n\nSo, A = (0, 0, 0), B = (√41, 0, 0).\n\nNow, let me place C somewhere in the xy-plane. Let me denote C = (p, q, 0). Then, AC = √80, so sqrt(p² + q²) = √80, so p² + q² = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = √89, so sqrt( (p - √41)^2 + q² ) = √89, so (p - √41)^2 + q² = 89.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(p - √41)^2 + q² - (p² + q²) = 89 - 80 => p² - 2p√41 + 41 + q² - p² - q² = 9 => -2p√41 + 41 = 9 => -2p√41 = -32 => p = 16 / √41.\n\nSo, p = 16/√41. Then, from p² + q² = 80:\n\n(256 / 41) + q² = 80 => q² = 80 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41 => q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024): 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12√21.\n\nSo, q = 12√21 / √41.\n\nSo, point C is at (16/√41, 12√21/√41, 0).\n\nNow, let's place point D somewhere in 3D space. Since AD = √89, BD = √80, and CD = √41.\n\nLet me denote D = (r, s, t). Then:\n\nAD = sqrt(r² + s² + t²) = √89 => r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nBD = sqrt( (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² ) = √80 => (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² = 80.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(r - √41)^2 + s² + t² - (r² + s² + t²) = 80 - 89 => r² - 2r√41 + 41 + s² + t² - r² - s² - t² = -9 => -2r√41 + 41 = -9 => -2r√41 = -50 => r = 25 / √41.\n\nSo, r = 25/√41.\n\nNow, from AD: r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nSo, (625 / 41) + s² + t² = 89 => s² + t² = 89 - 625/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41.\n\nSo, s² + t² = 3024 / 41.\n\nNow, we also have CD = √41. Point C is at (16/√41, 12√21/√41, 0), and D is at (25/√41, s, t). So, the distance CD is sqrt( (25/√41 - 16/√41)^2 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + (t - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (9/√41)^2 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + t² ) = sqrt(81/41 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + t² ) = √41.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n81/41 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + t² = 41.\n\nBut s² + t² = 3024 / 41, so let's expand (s - 12√21/√41)^2:\n\n= s² - 24√21 s / √41 + (12√21 / √41)^2\n\n= s² - (24√21 / √41) s + (144 * 21) / 41\n\n= s² - (24√21 / √41) s + 3024 / 41\n\nSo, plugging back into the equation:\n\n81/41 + s² - (24√21 / √41) s + 3024 / 41 + t² = 41\n\nBut s² + t² = 3024 / 41, so:\n\n81/41 + (3024 / 41) - (24√21 / √41) s + 3024 / 41 = 41\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me re-express:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\n81/41 + [s² - (24√21 / √41) s + 3024 / 41] + t² = 41\n\nBut s² + t² = 3024 / 41, so replacing s² + t²:\n\n81/41 + [3024 / 41 - (24√21 / √41) s] + 3024 / 41 = 41\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.

Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, and then find p+q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume V is abc. So, in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. So, we have:\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 54  \nabc = 23\n\nI need to find the minimal enclosing sphere for such boxes. The radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is half of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (a² + b² + c²)/4, given the constraints on the surface area and volume.\n\nSo, I need to minimize a² + b² + c² subject to 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nHmm, okay, so this is an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think.\n\nI remember that for a given surface area and volume, the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is as \"cube-like\" as possible. But since the volume is fixed, maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but a cube with surface area 54 would have each face area 54/6 = 9, so each edge would be 3, and the volume would be 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube. So, maybe it's a rectangular prism that's as close to a cube as possible given the volume constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the surface area and volume. Let me recall that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, if I can find a + b + c, then I can find a² + b² + c².\n\nBut I don't know a + b + c. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize a² + b² + c² with the given constraints.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote the function to minimize as f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c². The constraints are g(a, b, c) = 2(ab + bc + ac) - 54 = 0 and h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.\n\nSo, the Lagrangian is:\n\nL = a² + b² + c² - λ(2(ab + bc + ac) - 54) - μ(abc - 23)\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(2b + 2c) - μ(bc) = 0  \n∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(2a + 2c) - μ(ac) = 0  \n∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(2a + 2b) - μ(ab) = 0  \n∂L/∂λ = -(2(ab + bc + ac) - 54) = 0  \n∂L/∂μ = -(abc - 23) = 0\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\n1. 2a - 2λ(b + c) - μbc = 0  \n2. 2b - 2λ(a + c) - μac = 0  \n3. 2c - 2λ(a + b) - μab = 0  \n4. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54  \n5. abc = 23\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between a, b, c.\n\nLooking at equations 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can subtract them pairwise to find some symmetry.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n2b - 2λ(a + c) - μac - [2a - 2λ(b + c) - μbc] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2b - 2λa - 2λc - μac - 2a + 2λb + 2λc + μbc = 0  \nSimplify terms:\n\n(2b - 2a) + (-2λa + 2λb) + (-μac + μbc) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(b - a) + 2λ(b - a) + μc(b - a) = 0  \nFactor out (b - a):\n\n(b - a)(2 + 2λ + μc) = 0\n\nSo, either b = a or 2 + 2λ + μc = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n2c - 2λ(a + b) - μab - [2b - 2λ(a + c) - μac] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2c - 2λa - 2λb - μab - 2b + 2λa + 2λc + μac = 0  \nSimplify terms:\n\n(2c - 2b) + (-2λb + 2λc) + (-μab + μac) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(c - b) + 2λ(c - b) + μa(c - b) = 0  \nFactor out (c - b):\n\n(c - b)(2 + 2λ + μa) = 0\n\nSo, either c = b or 2 + 2λ + μa = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n2c - 2λ(a + b) - μab - [2a - 2λ(b + c) - μbc] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2c - 2λa - 2λb - μab - 2a + 2λb + 2λc + μbc = 0  \nSimplify terms:\n\n(2c - 2a) + (-2λa + 2λc) + (-μab + μbc) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(c - a) + 2λ(c - a) + μb(c - a) = 0  \nFactor out (c - a):\n\n(c - a)(2 + 2λ + μb) = 0\n\nSo, either c = a or 2 + 2λ + μb = 0.\n\nSo, from these three results, we have either all variables equal, or some relationships between λ and μ.\n\nCase 1: All variables equal, i.e., a = b = c.\n\nIf a = b = c, then the box is a cube. Let's check if this is possible.\n\nSurface area: 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then volume would be 27, but we need volume 23. So, this is not possible. Therefore, a, b, c cannot all be equal.\n\nCase 2: Two variables equal, say a = b ≠ c.\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, let's see what happens.\n\nSo, a = b. Then, let's denote a = b, so we have:\n\nSurface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(a² + 2ac) = 54  \nSo, 2a² + 4ac = 54  \nDivide by 2: a² + 2ac = 27  \nVolume: a²c = 23\n\nSo, from volume, c = 23/(a²). Substitute into surface area equation:\n\na² + 2a*(23/(a²)) = 27  \nSimplify: a² + 46/a = 27  \nMultiply both sides by a: a³ + 46 = 27a  \nSo, a³ - 27a + 46 = 0\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.\n\nTest a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0  \na=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, a=2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (a - 2):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a³ -27a +46 by (a - 2):\n\nCoefficients: 1, 0, -27, 46\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next term: 0 +2=2. Multiply by 2:4. Add to -27: -23. Multiply by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, quotient is a² + 2a -23.\n\nSo, a³ -27a +46 = (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23). Now, set equal to zero:\n\n(a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) = 0\n\nSo, a=2 or a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)\n\nSince a must be positive, a=2 or a= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898. But a must be positive, so both are possible.\n\nBut let's check a=2:\n\nIf a=2, then c=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75\n\nSo, a=2, b=2, c=5.75\n\nCheck surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac)=2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5)=2(27)=54. Correct.\n\nVolume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898, let's compute c=23/(a²). Let me compute a²:\n\na= -1 + 2√6, so a²=1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6≈25 -9.798≈15.202\n\nSo, c≈23/15.202≈1.513\n\nSo, a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.513\n\nCheck surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac)=2(a² + 2ac)=2*(15.202 + 2*3.898*1.513)=2*(15.202 + 11.812)=2*(27.014)=54.028≈54, which is approximately correct, considering rounding.\n\nSo, both solutions are valid.\n\nNow, let's compute a² + b² + c² for both cases.\n\nCase 2a: a=2, b=2, c=5.75\n\na² + b² + c²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625=41 + 1/16=657/16\n\nCase 2b: a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.513\n\nCompute a² + b² + c²≈2*(15.202) + (1.513)^2≈30.404 +2.289≈32.693\n\nWait, 32.693 is less than 41.0625, so this case gives a smaller a² + b² + c², which would mean a smaller sphere radius. So, this is better.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal? Or is there a case where all three sides are different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when all three sides are different. Hmm.\n\nBut before that, let me see if in the case where a = b, we have two possible solutions, one with a=2, c=5.75, and another with a≈3.898, c≈1.513. The second one gives a smaller a² + b² + c², so that's better.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal occurs when all three sides are different. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when two sides are equal, but not necessarily a = b. Maybe a different pair.\n\nBut in the previous case, assuming a = b gave us a better result. Maybe the minimal is achieved when two sides are equal, but not necessarily a = b.\n\nWait, but in the Lagrangian equations, we saw that either variables are equal or some other condition. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily a = b.\n\nBut in our case, when we assumed a = b, we found a solution with a smaller a² + b² + c². So, maybe that's the minimal.\n\nBut let me check if there's a case where all three sides are different and give a smaller a² + b² + c².\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three sides are different, but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the method of substitution.\n\nGiven that abc =23 and 2(ab + bc + ac)=54.\n\nLet me denote x = a, y = b, z = c.\n\nWe have:\n\n2(xy + yz + zx) =54 => xy + yz + zx=27  \nxyz=23\n\nWe need to minimize x² + y² + z².\n\nI recall that for positive real numbers, x² + y² + z² is minimized when variables are as equal as possible, given the constraints. But in our case, the constraints are on the sum of products and the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality that relates the sum of squares to the sum of products.\n\nWe know that x² + y² + z", "answer": "721"}

I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithmic identities to simplify these equations. Let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. log_x(y^x) = 10\n2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\n\nI think I can use the power rule for logarithms, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that to both equations:\n\nFor the first equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.\n\nOkay, so now I have:\n\n1. x * log_x(y) = 10\n2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10\n\nHmm, I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). That might be useful here because I see log_x(y) and log_y(x) in the equations. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let’s set a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a because of the reciprocal property.\n\nSo substituting back into the equations:\n\n1. x * a = 10\n2. 4y * (1/a) = 10\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x * a = 10\n2. (4y)/a = 10\n\nI can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of a. Let me do that.\n\nFrom the first equation: x = 10 / a.\n\nFrom the second equation: 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.\n\nSo now I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. But I also know that a = log_x(y). Let me write that down:\n\na = log_x(y)\n\nBut I can express log_x(y) in terms of natural logarithms or common logarithms. Let me use natural logarithms for this. So,\n\na = ln(y) / ln(x)\n\nBut I already have expressions for x and y in terms of a. So substituting those in:\n\na = ln((5a)/2) / ln(10/a)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can work through it. Let me write that equation:\n\na = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\na = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nThis seems like an equation in terms of a that I need to solve. Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:\n\na * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = a*ln(10) - a*ln(a)\n\nRight side: ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\na*ln(10) - a*ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy, but let me collect like terms. Let me bring all terms to one side:\n\na*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0\n\nFactor out ln(a) terms:\n\na*ln(10) - (a + 1)*ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0\n\nHmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can make a substitution or find a clever way to solve for a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that a is a rational number, maybe an integer, and test some values. Let me see.\n\nLet me try a = 2.\n\nPlugging a = 2 into the equation:\n\n2*ln(10) - (2 + 1)*ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 2*ln(10) - 3*ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - ln(5)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2*ln(10) = ln(100)\n2*ln(2) = ln(4)\nln(5) is as is.\n\nSo, ln(100) - ln(4) - ln(5) = ln(100 / (4*5)) = ln(100 / 20) = ln(5). So, 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - ln(5) = ln(5). So, 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - ln(5) - ln(5) = 0? Wait, no, I think I messed up.\n\nWait, let me recast it:\n\n2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - ln(5) = ln(100) - ln(4) - ln(5) = ln(100 / (4*5)) = ln(5). So, 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - ln(5) = ln(5). So, moving ln(5) to the left:\n\n2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) - 2*ln(5) = 0\n\nWhich is 2*(ln(10) - ln(2) - ln(5)) = 0\n\nBut ln(10) - ln(2) - ln(5) = ln(10/(2*5)) = ln(1) = 0. So, 2*0 = 0. So, yes, a = 2 satisfies the equation.\n\nGreat! So a = 2 is a solution. Let me check if there are other solutions, but maybe a = 2 is the only one.\n\nSo, if a = 2, then from earlier:\n\nx = 10 / a = 10 / 2 = 5\n\ny = (5a)/2 = (5*2)/2 = 5\n\nSo, x = 5 and y = 5. Therefore, xy = 5*5 = 25.\n\nWait, but let me verify if these values satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, because 5^5 is 3125, and log base 5 of 3125 is 5. But the equation says it should be 10. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let's go back. If a = 2, then x = 10 / a = 5, and y = (5a)/2 = 5. So, let's compute log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = 5, but the problem says it should be 10. So, that's not matching. So, something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution or in solving for a.\n\nWait, let me double-check the equations.\n\nWe had:\n\n1. x * log_x(y) = 10\n2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10\n\nWe set a = log_x(y), so log_y(x) = 1/a.\n\nSo, equation 1: x * a = 10 => x = 10/a\n\nEquation 2: 4y * (1/a) = 10 => 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2\n\nThen, a = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = ln((5a)/2)/ln(10/a)\n\nSo, a = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nThen, cross-multiplying: a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)\n\nWhich is a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)\n\nThen, moving all terms to left:\n\na*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0\n\nWhich is a*ln(10) - (a + 1)*ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0\n\nThen, I tried a = 2, and it seemed to satisfy, but when I plug back into the original equations, it didn't work. So, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the step where I plugged a = 2 into the equation.\n\nSo, a = 2:\n\nLeft side: 2*ln(10/2) = 2*ln(5)\n\nRight side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5)\n\nSo, 2*ln(5) = ln(5)? That's not true because 2*ln(5) is ln(25), which is not equal to ln(5). So, my earlier conclusion that a = 2 satisfies the equation was wrong.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me recast the equation:\n\na * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)\n\nSo, for a = 2:\n\nLeft side: 2 * ln(10/2) = 2 * ln(5) ≈ 2 * 1.609 ≈ 3.218\n\nRight side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.609\n\nSo, 3.218 ≈ 1.609? No, that's not equal. So, a = 2 is not a solution. Hmm, so my earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to try another value for a. Let me try a = 1.\n\na = 1:\n\nLeft side: 1 * ln(10/1) = ln(10) ≈ 2.302\n\nRight side: ln(5*1/2) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916\n\nNot equal.\n\na = 3:\n\nLeft side: 3 * ln(10/3) ≈ 3 * ln(3.333) ≈ 3 * 1.203 ≈ 3.609\n\nRight side: ln(5*3/2) = ln(7.5) ≈ 2.015\n\nNot equal.\n\na = 4:\n\nLeft side: 4 * ln(10/4) = 4 * ln(2.5) ≈ 4 * 0.916 ≈ 3.664\n\nRight side: ln(5*4/2) = ln(10) ≈ 2.302\n\nNot equal.\n\na = 5:\n\nLeft side: 5 * ln(10/5) = 5 * ln(2) ≈ 5 * 0.693 ≈ 3.465\n\nRight side: ln(5*5/2) = ln(12.5) ≈ 2.525\n\nNot equal.\n\nHmm, maybe a is not an integer. Maybe I need to solve this equation numerically.\n\nLet me denote f(a) = a * ln(10/a) - ln(5a/2). I need to find a such that f(a) = 0.\n\nLet me compute f(a) for some values:\n\na = 1: f(1) = 1*ln(10) - ln(2.5) ≈ 2.302 - 0.916 ≈ 1.386 > 0\n\na = 2: f(2) = 2*ln(5) - ln(5) ≈ 3.218 - 1.609 ≈ 1.609 > 0\n\na = 3: f(3) = 3*ln(10/3) - ln(7.5) ≈ 3*1.203 - 2.015 ≈ 3.609 - 2.015 ≈ 1.594 > 0\n\na = 4: f(4) = 4*ln(2.5) - ln(10) ≈ 4*0.916 - 2.302 ≈ 3.664 - 2.302 ≈ 1.362 > 0\n\na = 5: f(5) = 5*ln(2) - ln(12.5) ≈ 5*0.693 - 2.525 ≈ 3.465 - 2.525 ≈ 0.94 > 0\n\na = 6: f(6) = 6*ln(10/6) - ln(15) ≈ 6*ln(1.666) - 2.708 ≈ 6*0.510 - 2.708 ≈ 3.06 - 2.708 ≈ 0.352 > 0\n\na = 7: f(7) = 7*ln(10/7) - ln(17.5) ≈ 7*ln(1.428) - 2.862 ≈ 7*0.356 - 2.862 ≈ 2.492 - 2.862 ≈ -0.37 < 0\n\nOkay, so f(6) ≈ 0.352 > 0 and f(7) ≈ -0.37 < 0. So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between a = 6 and a = 7.\n\nLet me try a = 6.5:\n\nf(6.5) = 6.5*ln(10/6.5) - ln(5*6.5/2) =", "answer": "25"}

They take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob have a winning strategy, meaning no matter what Alice does, Bob can win.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, while a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, in this case, if n is a losing position, then the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Since Alice starts, if n is a losing position, Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.\n\nLet me try to figure out the pattern of losing positions. Let's denote P(n) as the position with n tokens. If from P(n), all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then P(n) is a losing position. Otherwise, it's a winning position.\n\nSo, let's start by analyzing small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over. But since the last person to take a token wins, n=0 is a losing position because you can't make a move. Wait, actually, in standard terms, n=0 is a losing position because the player to move cannot do anything and loses.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win.

Najděte $m+n$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen participating in a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, Jen selects 4 different numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly drawn from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the drawn numbers. She wins the main prize if all four of her numbers are among the drawn numbers. We need to find the probability that she wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the main prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the main prize automatically means she has won a prize, A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Total number of possible ways to draw 4 numbers from S:**\n   Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10, 4). Let me compute that:\n   C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.\n\n2. **Number of ways Jen can win the main prize (event A):**\n   She wins the main prize if all her 4 numbers are drawn. Since she has a specific set of 4 numbers, there's only 1 way this can happen. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.\n\n3. **Number of ways Jen can win a prize (event B):**\n   She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are drawn. This means we need to calculate the number of ways to draw 4 numbers such that at least two match her chosen numbers.\n\n   To find this, it's often easier to calculate the complement: the probability of winning nothing, which is when fewer than two numbers match. Then subtract that from 1.\n\n   So, the number of ways to draw 4 numbers with fewer than two matches is the sum of:\n   - Drawing 0 of her numbers: C(4,0)*C(6,4)\n   - Drawing 1 of her numbers: C(4,1)*C(6,3)\n\n   Let me compute these:\n   - C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15\n   - C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80\n\n   So, total ways to draw with fewer than two matches: 15 + 80 = 95.\n\n   Therefore, the number of ways to draw with at least two matches is total combinations minus the above: 210 - 95 = 115.\n\n   So, P(B) = 115 / 210.\n\n4. **Now, compute P(A|B):**\n   P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1 / 115.\n\n   Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\n   Alternatively, since P(A) is 1/210 and P(B) is 115/210, dividing them gives 1/115. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\n   But let me think again. Is the number of ways to win a prize correctly calculated?\n\n   She wins a prize if at least two numbers match. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the sum of:\n   - Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2)\n   - Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)\n   - Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)\n\n   Let me compute these:\n   - Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90\n   - Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24\n   - Exactly 4 matches: 1 * 1 = 1\n\n   So, total favorable outcomes: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. That matches the previous calculation. So, P(B) is indeed 115/210.\n\n   Therefore, P(A|B) = 1/115.\n\n   So, m = 1, n = 115. They are coprime since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1.\n\n   Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says \"4 numbers are náhodně vybrána z S.\" So, Jen selects 4 numbers, then 4 numbers are drawn. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the drawn numbers. She wins the main prize if all four are drawn.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is correct as I calculated. The probability of winning the main prize given that she has won a prize is 1/115.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. The number of possible winning combinations for the main prize is 1, as before. The number of combinations where she has at least two matches is 115. So, the conditional probability is 1/115.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}\n</think>\n\nJen selects 4 different numbers from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9, 10\\} \\). Four numbers are randomly drawn from \\( S \\). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the drawn numbers, and she wins the main prize if all four of her numbers are drawn. We need to find the probability that she wins the main prize given that she has won a prize.\n\n1. **Total number of possible ways to draw 4 numbers from \\( S \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{4} = 210\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways Jen can win the main prize (event \\( A \\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{There is only 1 way this can happen. So, } P(A) = \\frac{1}{210}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of ways Jen can win a prize (event \\( B \\)):**\n   She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are drawn. We calculate the complement (fewer than two matches) and subtract from the total:\n   - Drawing 0 of her numbers: \\( \\binom{4}{0} \\binom{6}{4} = 1 \\times 15 = 15 \\)\n   - Drawing 1 of her numbers: \\( \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{6}{3} = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\)\n   - Total ways to draw with fewer than two matches: \\( 15 + 80 = 95 \\)\n   - Total ways to draw with at least two matches: \\( 210 - 95 = 115 \\)\n   - So, \\( P(B) = \\frac{115}{210} \\)\n\n4. **Compute \\( P(A|B) \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}} = \\frac{1}{115}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize is \\( \\frac{1}{115} \\). Therefore, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 115 \\), and \\( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{116}\n\\]", "answer": "116"}

The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.\n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, point D is one of its vertices, and point C is the opposite corner. So, the line DC is a side of the rectangle, which has length AB = 107. But wait, BC is 16, so DC must be equal to AB, which is 107. So, DC is 107 units long.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, DE + EC + CF = DC + CF? Wait, no, because D, E, C, F are collinear, but the order isn't specified. It could be D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F or some other order. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw a rough sketch. Let me think: ABCD is a rectangle, so let's say A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, D at the top left. So, DC is the top side, length 107. Then, EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe E and F are on the line DC extended? Or maybe E is somewhere else.\n\nWait, the problem says points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in some order. So, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is beyond D, and F is between D and C? Hmm.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be useful later.\n\nGiven that, let me try to assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me set point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is 107. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107, 16), and point A would be at (0, 16).\n\nWait, no, hold on. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is 107 and BC is 16. So, if I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), B at (107, 16), and A at (0, 16). That makes sense.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let's see. Since EFGH is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17. So, if I can figure out where E and F are, I can find the coordinates of G and H.\n\nBut the key is that points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passing through D, E, C, F is a straight line. Let's denote this line as line l.\n\nSince D is at (0,0) and C is at (107, 0), the line DC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So, if E and F are also on this line, they must lie somewhere along the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, EFGH is a rectangle. So, if E and F are on the x-axis, then G and H must be somewhere else. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\n- D: (0,0)\n- C: (107,0)\n- A: (0,16)\n- B: (107,16)\n\nNow, E and F are on the x-axis. Let's say E is at (e, 0) and F is at (f, 0). Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are 184 and 17 respectively. So, the length from E to F is 184, and from F to G is 17.\n\nBut wait, EF is 184, which is the length of the side of the rectangle. So, if E is at (e,0) and F is at (f,0), then the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184. Similarly, FG is 17, so from F, moving perpendicularly to the line EF (which is along the x-axis), so FG would be vertical or horizontal? Since EF is along the x-axis, FG must be vertical, either upwards or downwards.\n\nBut since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent sides, so FG is perpendicular to EF. Since EF is along the x-axis, FG must be vertical. So, from point F at (f,0), moving up or down 17 units to get to G.\n\nSimilarly, from E, moving in the same direction (up or down) 17 units to get to H, because EH is also 17.\n\nBut wait, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so the sides are 184 and 17. So, if EF is along the x-axis, then FG is vertical, either up or down.\n\nNow, the other rectangle ABCD has points A, D, H, G on a circle. So, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, and G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.\n\nSo, if I can find the coordinates of H and G, I can use the cyclic condition to find the necessary lengths.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to E and F first.\n\nSince E and F are on the x-axis, let's say E is at (e,0) and F is at (e + 184, 0), because EF = 184. But wait, the direction could be either to the right or to the left. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), if E is between D and C, then e would be between 0 and 107, and F would be at e + 184, which would be beyond C if e is positive. Alternatively, E could be to the left of D, so e is negative, and F would be at e + 184, which could be on either side.\n\nBut since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), E and F must lie on the x-axis. So, E and F are on the x-axis, with E somewhere and F somewhere else.\n\nBut let's think about the rectangle EFGH. If E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, G would be at (e + 184, 17) or (e + 184, -17), and H would be at (e, 17) or (e, -17). Since rectangles can be above or below the x-axis.\n\nBut considering that points A, D, H, G are on a circle, and A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), so the circle passes through (0,16) and (0,0). So, the circle's center must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AD, which is the line x = 0, since AD is vertical. The perpendicular bisector of AD is the horizontal line halfway between y=0 and y=16, which is y=8. So, the center of the circle is at (0,8), and the radius is the distance from (0,8) to (0,0), which is 8. So, the circle has equation x² + (y - 8)² = 8² = 64.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. The perpendicular bisector of AD: since AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,16), the midpoint is (0,8). The perpendicular bisector would be the horizontal line y=8. So, any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant from A and D. So, the center of the circle must lie on y=8. But since the circle passes through A(0,16) and D(0,0), the center must be at (0,8), because that's the only point on y=8 that is equidistant to both A and D. The distance from (0,8) to A is 8 units, and to D is also 8 units. So, the radius is 8, and the equation is x² + (y - 8)² = 64.\n\nNow, points H and G must lie on this circle. So, their coordinates must satisfy x² + (y - 8)² = 64.\n\nNow, let's get back to rectangle EFGH. Let's assume that G is at (e + 184, 17) and H is at (e, 17). Alternatively, they could be at (e + 184, -17) and (e, -17). But since the circle is centered at (0,8) with radius 8, the points H and G must be within 8 units from (0,8). So, their y-coordinates can't be too far.\n\nIf G is at (e + 184, 17), then the y-coordinate is 17, which is 9 units above the center's y-coordinate of 8. The radius is 8, so 17 is 9 units above 8, which is outside the circle. Similarly, if G is at (e + 184, -17), the y-coordinate is -17, which is 25 units below 8, which is way outside the circle. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that my assumption about the direction of FG is wrong. Maybe FG is not vertical but horizontal? But EF is 184, which is along the x-axis, so FG should be vertical because it's a rectangle. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if EF is along the x-axis, FG must be vertical. So, either up or down. But as we saw, if FG is up, G would be at y=17, which is outside the circle. If FG is down, G would be at y=-17, which is also outside the circle. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the sides wrong. Maybe EF is 17 and FG is 184? But the problem says FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is the longer side.\n\nHmm, maybe the rectangle EFGH is placed such that EF is along the x-axis, but FG is not vertical but at some angle? Wait, no, because if EF is along the x-axis, FG must be vertical because it's a rectangle. So, the sides must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the orientation. Maybe EFGH is not placed with EF along the x-axis, but rather rotated. But the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear, which are on the x-axis. So, E and F are on the x-axis, so EF is along the x-axis. Therefore, FG must be vertical.\n\nBut then, as I saw, G would be at (e + 184, 17) or (e + 184, -17), which are outside the circle. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe my initial assumption about the placement is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps E and F are not both on the x-axis beyond D and C, but maybe E is on DC and F is on the extension beyond C. Let me think.\n\nWait, D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). If E is between D and C, say at (e,0) where 0 < e < 107, then F would be at (e + 184, 0). But e + 184 would be way beyond C, which is at 107. So, F would be at (e + 184, 0), which is beyond C. Then, FG is 17 units, so G would be at (e + 184, 17) or (e + 184, -17). But as before, these points are outside the circle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is beyond D, so E is at (e,0) where e < 0, and F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, F could be on the x-axis, maybe even between D and C if e is negative enough. For example, if e = -77, then F would be at (-77 + 184) = 107, which is point C. So, F would coincide with C. But the problem says points D, E, C, F are collinear, so F could be at C, but then E would be at (-77,0). Then, FG would be from F (107,0) to G (107,17) or (107,-17). Then, H would be at (-77,17) or (-77,-17).\n\nBut then, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, and G must lie on a circle. If G is at (107,17), then let's check if (107,17) lies on the circle x² + (y - 8)² = 64. Plugging in, 107² + (17 - 8)² = 11449 + 81", "answer": "104"}

Najděte počet takových cest, které změní směr přesně čtyřikrát, jak je uvedeno v příkladech níže.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of paths of length 16 from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an 8x8 grid. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the bottom-left to the top-right corner requires moving 7 steps right and 7 steps up, right? Because each move from one intersection to another is either right or up. So, in total, that's 14 moves. Wait, but the problem says the path has a length of 16. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think.\n\nOh, maybe the grid is 8x8 squares, which means there are 9x9 intersections. So, moving from the bottom-left (0,0) to the top-right (8,8) would require 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. That makes sense because each move is along a line segment, so the number of moves equals the length of the path. So, the path length is 16, which is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is about counting the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. So, each time the path changes from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, starting from the bottom-left, the first move can be either right or up, and then each subsequent move can either continue in the same direction or switch.\n\nWait, but how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments or something? Let me think. Each direction change corresponds to a turn in the path. So, if a path changes direction four times, it means it has five straight segments. Because each change adds a new segment. For example, if you start moving right, then change to up, that's one change, resulting in two segments. So, four changes would result in five segments.\n\nSo, the path is made up of five straight segments, alternating between right and up. Since we start at the bottom-left, the first segment can be either right or up. But since we need to end at the top-right, the number of right segments must equal the number of up segments, or differ by one? Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nWait, in an 8x8 grid, we need to move 8 right and 8 up. So, if we have five segments, they must alternate between right and up. So, if the first segment is right, then the segments go right, up, right, up, right. That would be three right segments and two up segments. But we need eight right and eight up moves. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Similarly, if the first segment is up, then we have up, right, up, right, up, which is three up and two right segments. Again, not enough.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If we have five segments, each segment can consist of multiple moves in the same direction. So, for example, the first segment could be moving right multiple times, then up multiple times, and so on. So, the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8, spread across the segments.\n\nSo, if we have five segments, alternating between right and up, starting with either right or up. Let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: The path starts with a right segment. Then the segments alternate: right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments.\n\nCase 2: The path starts with an up segment. Then the segments alternate: up, right, up, right, up. So, three up segments and two right segments.\n\nBut in both cases, the total number of right and up moves must be 8 each. So, in Case 1, we have three right segments and two up segments. Let me denote the lengths of the right segments as r1, r2, r3 and the lengths of the up segments as u1, u2. Then, we have:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 8\n\nu1 + u2 = 8\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, we have three up segments and two right segments:\n\nu1 + u2 + u3 = 8\n\nr1 + r2 = 8\n\nSo, for each case, we can compute the number of ways to distribute the moves among the segments.\n\nBut wait, the direction changes are exactly four, so the number of segments is five. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, four direction changes mean five segments.\n\nSo, for each case, starting with right or up, we can compute the number of compositions.\n\nIn combinatorics, the number of ways to write a number as the sum of positive integers is given by the stars and bars theorem. For example, the number of ways to write n as the sum of k positive integers is C(n-1, k-1).\n\nSo, in Case 1: Starting with right, we have three right segments and two up segments.\n\nNumber of ways to distribute 8 right moves into 3 segments: C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21\n\nNumber of ways to distribute 8 up moves into 2 segments: C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7\n\nSo, total for Case 1: 21 * 7 = 147\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2: Starting with up, we have three up segments and two right segments.\n\nNumber of ways to distribute 8 up moves into 3 segments: C(7,2) = 21\n\nNumber of ways to distribute 8 right moves into 2 segments: C(7,1) = 7\n\nTotal for Case 2: 21 * 7 = 147\n\nSo, total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that all? Because the problem says \"cesty délky 16\", which is 16 moves, which is correct because 8 right and 8 up. So, the total number of paths without any restriction is C(16,8) = 12870. But we are only counting those with exactly four direction changes.\n\nBut according to my calculation, it's 294. Hmm, that seems low. Let me check my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of segments. If we have four direction changes, that means five segments. So, starting with right, we have right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, starting with up, three up and two right.\n\nBut in each case, the number of ways is C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 21*7=147 for each case, so total 294.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, the number of runs is five, which can be either starting with right or up.\n\nSo, the number of compositions for right and up moves.\n\nYes, that's what I did. So, for starting with right, we have three right runs and two up runs. The number of ways to split 8 right moves into three runs is C(7,2), and 8 up moves into two runs is C(7,1). Similarly for starting with up.\n\nSo, 21*7 + 21*7 = 294.\n\nBut wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe using recursion or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the number of paths with exactly k direction changes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of paths = 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2) if k is even, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's more complicated. Let me recall that in a grid, the number of paths with exactly r right runs and u up runs is C(8-1, r-1)*C(8-1, u-1). But since the runs alternate, the number of runs must differ by at most one.\n\nWait, in our case, since we have five runs, which is odd, so starting with right, we have three right runs and two up runs, or starting with up, three up runs and two right runs.\n\nSo, the total number is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)] = 2*(21*7)=294.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller grid to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose we have a 2x2 grid, so from (0,0) to (2,2). The total number of paths is C(4,2)=6.\n\nNow, how many paths change direction exactly twice? Let's see.\n\nIn a 2x2 grid, moving from bottom-left to top-right, the number of direction changes can be 0, 2, or 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the minimal number of direction changes is 0 (if you go all right then all up or vice versa), but actually, you can't go all right then all up in a 2x2 grid because you have to make two right and two up moves. So, the minimal number of direction changes is 2.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a 2x2 grid, the minimal number of direction changes is 2. For example, right, right, up, up has zero direction changes? Wait, no, because you have to turn once from right to up. So, actually, the number of direction changes is 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.\n\nIn a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). Each path consists of two right (R) and two up (U) moves. The number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches from R to U or U to R.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nRRUU: direction changes once (after the two R's)\n\nRU RU: direction changes three times\n\nRURU: direction changes three times\n\nURUR: direction changes three times\n\nURRU: direction changes once\n\nSo, in total, the number of direction changes can be 1 or 3.\n\nWait, so in a 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes is either 1 or 3.\n\nSo, for exactly two direction changes, there are zero paths. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong because in the 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes is always odd. So, in an 8x8 grid, maybe the number of direction changes must be even or odd?\n\nWait, in the 8x8 grid, starting from right, the number of segments is five, which is odd. So, the number of direction changes is four, which is even. Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, starting from right, the number of segments is three, which is odd, and the number of direction changes is two, which is even. Wait, no, in the 2x2 grid, starting with right, the segments are R, U, R, U, which is four segments, but that's not possible because you only have two R and two U moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the original problem.\n\nIn the 8x8 grid, the number of direction changes is four, which is even. So, the number of segments is five, which is odd. So, starting with right, we have three right segments and two up segments, or starting with up, three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, the number of ways is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)] = 294.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there another way to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the number of paths with exactly k direction changes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of paths = 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2) when k is even.\n\nWait, but in our case, n = m =8, and k=4.\n\nSo, plugging in, we get 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,2) = 2 * 21 * 21 = 882.\n\nWait, that's different from 294. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me check.\n\nI think the formula is that the number of paths with exactly 2r direction changes is 2 * C(n-1, r) * C(m-1, r). So, for k=4 direction changes, r=2.\n\nSo, number of paths = 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,2) = 2 * 21 * 21 = 882.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 294. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think about the 2x2 grid again. If n=2, m=2, and k=2 direction changes, which would correspond to r=1.\n\nSo, number of paths = 2 * C(1,1) * C(1,1) = 2 *1*1=2.\n\nBut in the 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes? Let's see.\n\nThe possible paths are:\n\n1. RRUU: 1 direction change\n\n2. RURU: 3 direction changes\n\n3. RURU: same as above\n\n4. URRU: 1 direction change\n\n5. URUR: 3 direction changes\n\n6. UURR: 1 direction change\n\nWait, so in the 2x2 grid, there are no paths with exactly two direction changes. So, the formula gives 2, but actual is zero. So, the formula must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is for something else. Maybe it's for the number of runs, not direction changes.\n\nWait, in the 2x2 grid, the number of runs can be 2 or 4. For example, RRUU has 2 runs, RURU has 4 runs.\n\nSo, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. So, if we have r runs, the number of direction changes is r-1.\n\nSo, in the 2x2 grid, if we have 2 runs, direction changes is 1; if we have 4 runs, direction changes is 3.\n\nSo, the formula I saw earlier might be counting the number of paths with exactly r runs, which would be 2 * C(n-1, r/2 -1) * C(m-1, r/2 -1) when r is even.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me look it up in my mind.\n\nI recall that the number of lattice paths from (0,0", "answer": "294"}

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(z\\) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. That might make things easier. Let me write \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\). That way, I can express everything in terms of \\(\\theta\\) and then maybe take the derivative to find the maximum.\n\nSo, substituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) into the expression, let's see:\n\nThe first term is \\((75 + 117i)z\\). Substituting \\(z\\), that becomes \\((75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta}\\). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants: 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So, it's \\(300 + 468i\\) multiplied by \\(e^{i\\theta}\\). Hmm, but actually, I should think of it as multiplying two complex numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write \\(75 + 117i\\) in polar form as well.\n\nLet me compute the magnitude and angle of \\(75 + 117i\\). The magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{75^2 + 117^2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n75 squared is 5625, 117 squared is 13689. Adding them together: 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So, the magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{19314}\\). Let me see, 139 squared is 19321, which is just a bit more than 19314, so it's approximately 139. But maybe I can leave it as \\(\\sqrt{19314}\\) for now.\n\nThe angle \\(\\phi\\) of \\(75 + 117i\\) is \\(\\tan^{-1}(117/75)\\). Let me compute that. 117 divided by 75 is 1.56. So, \\(\\tan^{-1}(1.56)\\). I know that \\(\\tan(57^\\circ)\\) is about 1.539, and \\(\\tan(58^\\circ)\\) is about 1.600. So, 1.56 is between 57 and 58 degrees. Maybe approximately 57.5 degrees? Let me just keep it as \\(\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(117/75)\\) for now.\n\nSo, \\(75 + 117i = \\sqrt{19314}e^{i\\phi}\\), where \\(\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(117/75)\\).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\). Since \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), this becomes \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} = \\frac{24 + 36i}{e^{i\\theta}}\\). Again, maybe I can write \\(24 + 36i\\) in polar form.\n\nCalculating the magnitude: \\(\\sqrt{24^2 + 36^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1296} = \\sqrt{1872}\\). Hmm, 1872 is 16*117, so \\(\\sqrt{16*117} = 4\\sqrt{117}\\). The angle is \\(\\tan^{-1}(36/24) = \\tan^{-1}(1.5)\\). That's a standard angle, about 56.3 degrees or \\(\\tan^{-1}(3/2)\\).\n\nSo, \\(24 + 36i = 4\\sqrt{117}e^{i\\psi}\\), where \\(\\psi = \\tan^{-1}(36/24) = \\tan^{-1}(3/2)\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \\sqrt{19314}e^{i\\phi} \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{117}e^{i\\psi}}{4e^{i\\theta}} = 4\\sqrt{19314}e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)} + \\sqrt{117}e^{i(\\psi - \\theta)}\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe instead of converting both terms to polar form, I can express the entire expression in terms of \\(\\theta\\) and then find the real part.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), so \\(1/z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nFirst term: \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta}\\)\n\nSecond term: \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\)\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta}\\)\n\nLet me write \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\). So, multiplying:\n\n\\(4(75 + 117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nLet me compute this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply 75 by \\(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\): \\(75\\cos\\theta + 75i\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nThen, multiply 117i by \\(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\): \\(117i\\cos\\theta + 117i^2\\sin\\theta = 117i\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nSo, adding these together:\n\n\\(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta + i(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n\\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta) + i4(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta + i(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nOkay, that's the first term.\n\nNow, the second term: \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\). So, multiplying:\n\n\\(24(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) + 36i(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nCompute this:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta\n\nSimplify:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)\n\nSo, the second term is:\n\n24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)\n\nNow, adding the first term and the second term together:\n\nFirst term: \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta + i(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nSecond term: \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nAdding the real parts:\n\n\\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta = (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nAdding the imaginary parts:\n\n\\(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta = (300 -24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta = 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta\\)\n\nSo, the entire expression is:\n\n\\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta + i(276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nBut we are only interested in the real part, which is \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\). So, our goal is to maximize this real part.\n\nSo, the real part is \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\). Let me denote this as \\(R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nTo find the maximum of \\(R(\\theta)\\), I can use the method of expressing it as a single sinusoidal function. Remember that \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta = C\\cos(\\theta - \\phi)\\), where \\(C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\) and \\(\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(B/A)\\) or something like that.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, it's \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\), but here it's \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\), so it's like \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) with \\(A = 324\\) and \\(B = -432\\).\n\nSo, the maximum value of \\(R(\\theta)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute \\(324^2\\):\n\n324 * 324: Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 976? Wait, 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, and 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, \\(324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is \\(\\sqrt{291,600}\\). Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 40^2 = 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So, (500 + 40)^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, \\(\\sqrt{291,600} = 540\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\(R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\). The maximum of \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\), so yes, that's correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about the angle \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\cos\\phi = A/C\\) and \\(\\sin\\phi = B/C\\), where \\(C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\). So, in this case, \\(\\cos\\phi = 324/540 = 0.6\\), and \\(\\sin\\phi = -432/540 = -0.8\\). So, \\(\\phi\\) is in the fourth quadrant, with \\(\\tan\\phi = (-432)/324 = -1.333... = -4/3\\). So, \\(\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(-4/3)\\). That makes sense.\n\nTherefore, \\(R(\\theta) = 540", "answer": "540"}

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nWe have a triangle ABC, and there are 2024 circles with radius 1 arranged in a certain way. These circles are tangent to each other, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. The problem is asking for the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and then to find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I need to visualize this setup. There's a triangle ABC, and inside it, there are 2024 small circles, each with radius 1. These circles are arranged such that each is tangent to the next, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. So, it's like a chain of circles inside the triangle, touching two sides.\n\nWait, so maybe it's similar to circles packed along the angle bisector? Or perhaps arranged in a way that they form a kind of spiral? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nSince two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC, which are two sides of the triangle, that suggests that these circles are near the vertex B. So, maybe the circles are arranged in a line from near vertex B towards the inradius? Or perhaps they form a chain that starts near B and goes towards the inradius.\n\nWait, the problem says \"postupně tečných,\" which translates to \"successively tangent.\" So, each circle is tangent to the next one in the sequence. So, it's like a chain of circles, each touching the next, starting from near B and going towards the interior of the triangle.\n\nGiven that there are 2024 circles, each with radius 1, arranged in this way, and two of them are tangent to AB and BC. So, the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, and then each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one and also to the sides? Or maybe just tangent to the previous one and not necessarily the sides?\n\nWait, the problem says \"dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC.\" So, two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC. So, maybe the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, and the second circle is tangent to the first one and also to AB and BC? Or maybe the first two circles are each tangent to AB and BC?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again: \"Osm kruhů o poloměru 34 je postupně tečných a dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC trojúhelníku ABC.\" So, it's saying that 8 circles of radius 34 are successively tangent, and two of them are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC.\n\nWait, hold on, the original problem mentions 8 circles of radius 34, but then it says 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same way. So, maybe the 8 circles of radius 34 are an example, and then 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged similarly.\n\nSo, perhaps the triangle ABC is such that it can contain 8 circles of radius 34 arranged in a chain, each tangent to the next, with two of them tangent to sides AB and BC. Similarly, it can contain 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged in the same way.\n\nSo, the inradius of triangle ABC is the same in both cases, but the number of circles and their radii are different. So, maybe the inradius can be calculated based on the number of circles and their radii.\n\nWait, so perhaps the inradius is related to the number of circles and their radii in some linear way? Let me think.\n\nIf we have a chain of circles inside a triangle, each tangent to the next, and two of them tangent to two sides, then the length from the vertex to the point where the chain ends would be related to the number of circles and their radii.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the problem where you have circles packed along the angle bisector, each tangent to the two sides and the previous circle. In that case, the distance from the vertex to the inradius can be calculated based on the number of circles and their radii.\n\nBut in this case, the circles are only tangent to each other and two of them are tangent to the sides. So, maybe the first circle is tangent to both sides AB and BC, and each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one and also to one of the sides? Or maybe not necessarily both sides.\n\nWait, the problem says \"dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC.\" So, two circles are tangent to AB and BC. So, maybe the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, and the second circle is also tangent to AB and BC, but also tangent to the first circle? Or maybe the first two circles are each tangent to AB and BC, and then the rest are tangent to the previous one.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to think of it as a chain of circles, each tangent to the next, with the first two circles also tangent to sides AB and BC.\n\nSo, if we have two circles tangent to AB and BC, and then each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one, forming a chain. So, the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, the second circle is tangent to AB and BC and also tangent to the first circle, and so on.\n\nWait, but if each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one, but not necessarily to the sides, then only the first two circles are tangent to the sides. Hmm, but the problem says \"dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC,\" which is \"two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC.\" So, maybe only two circles are tangent to both AB and BC, and the rest are just tangent to the previous circle.\n\nSo, the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, the second circle is tangent to the first circle and also tangent to AB and BC, and then the third circle is tangent to the second circle but not necessarily to AB and BC, and so on.\n\nWait, but if the second circle is tangent to AB and BC, then it's also near the vertex B, but slightly further in. So, maybe the chain is such that each circle is tangent to the previous one and also to AB and BC, but that would mean all circles are tangent to AB and BC, which contradicts the problem statement that only two are.\n\nHmm, maybe the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, the second circle is tangent to the first circle and to AB, but not BC, and the third circle is tangent to the second circle and to BC, and so on, alternating sides. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two circles are each tangent to AB and BC, and then the rest are tangent to the previous circle but not to the sides. So, the first two circles are near vertex B, each tangent to both sides, and then the chain continues inward, each circle tangent to the previous one.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the first two circles are each tangent to AB and BC, and then each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one, forming a chain that goes towards the inradius.\n\nSo, in this case, the distance from vertex B to the inradius would be related to the number of circles and their radii.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let me think about the geometry here.\n\nIf we have two circles tangent to AB and BC, each with radius r, then the distance from B to the center of each circle would be something like r / sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle at B.\n\nWait, yes, because if you have a circle tangent to two sides of a triangle, the distance from the vertex to the center is r / sin(theta/2). So, for each circle tangent to AB and BC, the distance from B to the center is r / sin(theta/2).\n\nBut in this case, the first two circles are both tangent to AB and BC, so their centers are each at a distance of r / sin(theta/2) from B. But since they are also tangent to each other, the distance between their centers should be 2r.\n\nWait, so if the first circle is at distance d1 = r / sin(theta/2) from B, and the second circle is at distance d2 = r / sin(theta/2) from B as well, but in a different direction? Wait, no, both circles are on the same side, so maybe the distance between their centers is 2r, but they are both at the same distance from B.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Maybe the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, and the second circle is tangent to the first circle and also to AB and BC. So, the second circle is a bit further along the angle bisector.\n\nWait, so the first circle has center at distance d1 = r / sin(theta/2) from B, and the second circle has center at distance d2 = d1 + 2r, because the distance between centers is 2r (since they are tangent). But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because if both circles are tangent to AB and BC, their centers lie along the angle bisector of angle B. So, the distance between their centers would be along the angle bisector. So, if the first circle is at distance d1 from B, the second circle is at distance d2 = d1 + 2r, because the distance between centers is 2r.\n\nBut wait, if both circles are tangent to AB and BC, their centers are both at a distance of r / sin(theta/2) from B, but that would mean d1 = d2, which contradicts the idea that they are spaced 2r apart.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think again.\n\nIf two circles are tangent to AB and BC, their centers lie on the angle bisector of angle B. The distance from B to each center is r / sin(theta/2). If the two circles are also tangent to each other, then the distance between their centers is 2r. So, the distance between the two centers is 2r, but both are at a distance of r / sin(theta/2) from B. So, the distance between them is |d1 - d2| = 2r.\n\nBut if both are on the same line (the angle bisector), then one is further out than the other. So, if the first circle is at distance d1 = r / sin(theta/2), the second circle is at distance d2 = d1 + 2r. But wait, that would mean the second circle is further away from B, but it's also supposed to be tangent to AB and BC, which would require its center to be at distance r / sin(theta/2) from B. But d2 = d1 + 2r would be greater than d1, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the second circle is actually closer to B? So, d2 = d1 - 2r. But then d2 would be less than d1, but both centers are on the angle bisector. So, if the first circle is at d1, the second circle is at d2 = d1 - 2r, but then d2 must still be greater than or equal to r / sin(theta/2). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the two circles are arranged such that the first is tangent to AB and BC, and the second is tangent to the first circle and also to AB and BC. So, the second circle is a bit further along the angle bisector, but still tangent to both sides.\n\nIn that case, the distance from B to the first center is d1 = r / sin(theta/2), and the distance from B to the second center is d2 = d1 + 2r. But wait, if the second circle is also tangent to AB and BC, then d2 must also equal r / sin(theta/2). But that would mean d1 + 2r = d1, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the two circles are not both tangent to AB and BC, but rather, each is tangent to one of the sides. Wait, but the problem says \"dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC,\" which is \"two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC.\" So, each of those two circles is tangent to both AB and BC.\n\nWait, maybe the two circles are arranged such that one is tangent to AB and BC, and the other is tangent to AB and BC as well, but on the other side of the angle bisector? No, that doesn't make sense because the angle bisector is a single line.\n\nWait, perhaps the two circles are arranged such that one is tangent to AB and BC, and the other is tangent to AB and BC but on the opposite side of the angle bisector? But in a triangle, the angle bisector is unique, so I don't think that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe the two circles are arranged such that one is tangent to AB and BC, and the other is tangent to AB and the first circle, and also to BC and the first circle? Hmm, that might form a sort of chain where each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one and to both sides.\n\nBut then, if that's the case, each circle would be tangent to both sides, which would mean all circles are tangent to AB and BC, which contradicts the problem statement that only two are.\n\nWait, maybe the first circle is tangent to AB and BC, the second circle is tangent to the first circle and to AB, and the third circle is tangent to the second circle and to BC, and so on, alternating sides. But then, only the first circle is tangent to both AB and BC, and the rest are tangent to only one side or the other.\n\nBut the problem says two circles are tangent to AB and BC, so maybe the first and the second circles are each tangent to both sides, and then the rest are tangent to the previous circle and one side.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about the general case. If we have a chain of n circles, each tangent to the next, with the first two circles tangent to both sides AB and BC, then the inradius can be calculated based on the number of circles and their radii.\n\nI recall that in such configurations, the inradius r_in is equal to the radius of the circles multiplied by (n + 1), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inradius is related to the number of circles and their radii in a way that involves the angle at B.\n\nWait, let's denote the angle at vertex B as theta. Then, the distance from B to the inradius is r_in / sin(theta/2). But in this case, we have a chain of circles, each tangent to the next, with two circles tangent to AB and BC.\n\nSo, perhaps the total distance from B to the inradius is equal to the sum of the distances from B to the centers of the two circles tangent to AB and BC,", "answer": "197"}

Najděte největší reálné číslo, které je menší než $BD^2$ pro všechny takové kosočtverce.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the largest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a key property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, then the midpoint of AC and BD is the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). So, the coordinates of the four points are (x, y), (-x, -y), (p, q), (-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Let me write that down.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(x - p)² + (y - q)²]\nDistance BC: sqrt[(p + x)² + (q + y)²]\nDistance CD: sqrt[(-x + p)² + (-y + q)²]\nDistance DA: sqrt[(x + p)² + (y + q)²]\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all these distances should be equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, perhaps I can use the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus to find relations between the coordinates.\n\nLet me recall that for a hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x. In this case, a² = 20 and b² = 24, so the asymptotes are y = ±(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = ±(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = ±(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x. So, approximately ±1.095x.\n\nNow, since the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, and they intersect at the origin, perhaps the diagonals are along the asymptotes? Or maybe not necessarily, but perhaps aligned in some way with the hyperbola's axes.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, so the rhombus should also be symmetric in the same way. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me compute the slopes.\n\nSlope of AC: (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.\n\nSlope of BD: (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.\n\nSince they are perpendicular, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. Therefore, y q = -x p.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAlso, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.\n\nFor point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.\n\nSo, both points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C.\n\nLet me compute AB² and BC².\n\nAB² = (x - p)² + (y - q)².\n\nBC² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².\n\nSince AB = BC, AB² = BC².\n\nSo,\n\n(x - p)² + (y - q)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q².\n\nRight side: p² + 2xp + x² + q² + 2yq + y².\n\nSet them equal:\n\nx² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q² = p² + 2xp + x² + q² + 2yq + y².\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: x² + p² + y² + q² - 2xp - 2yq.\n\nRight: x² + p² + y² + q² + 2xp + 2yq.\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = 4xp + 4yq.\n\nSo, 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nBut earlier, we had from the slopes: y q = -x p.\n\nSo, substituting y q = -x p into xp + yq = 0:\n\nxp + (-x p) = 0 => 0 = 0.\n\nSo, that condition is automatically satisfied. So, the equality of AB and BC doesn't give us any new information beyond the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need another condition. Since all sides are equal, perhaps I can use another pair of sides, like BC and CD.\n\nWait, but BC and CD would give the same condition as AB and BC, so maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, perhaps I can express the coordinates in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the other points are -OA and -OB.\n\nSo, the four points are OA, OB, -OA, -OB.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, so OA and OC are opposite vertices, as are OB and OD.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the diagonals as vectors. Let me denote vector OA as (x, y) and vector OB as (p, q). Then, since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are 2OA and 2OB, respectively.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA · OB = 0.\n\nWait, OA · OB = x p + y q = 0. Which is consistent with our earlier result.\n\nSo, OA · OB = 0.\n\nAlso, since OA and OB are points on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two points on the hyperbola, OA and OB, such that OA · OB = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the length BD is sqrt[(p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))²] = sqrt[(2p)² + (2q)²] = 2 sqrt(p² + q²). Therefore, BD² = 4(p² + q²).\n\nSimilarly, AC² = 4(x² + y²).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the area can also be expressed as (AC * BD)/2. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD², or perhaps the minimum value of BD², but the problem says \"the largest real number which is less than BD² for all such rhombuses.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD². So, essentially, the infimum of BD².\n\nWait, no, the largest number less than BD² for all rhombuses. So, it's the infimum of BD², because we need a number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses, and the largest such number would be the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD², which is 4(p² + q²), given that (p, q) lies on the hyperbola p²/20 - q²/24 = 1 and that OA · OB = 0, where OA is (x, y) and OB is (p, q).\n\nWait, but OA and OB are two different points on the hyperbola, with OA · OB = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize points on the hyperbola and then find the minimum of BD².\n\nLet me try to parameterize the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, a standard parametrization is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a² = 20, b² = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, let me write OA as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ). Similarly, OB is another point on the hyperbola, but such that OA · OB = 0.\n\nSo, let me denote OB as (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ). Then, OA · OB = 0 implies:\n\n(2√5 secθ)(2√5 secφ) + (2√6 tanθ)(2√6 tanφ) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4*5 secθ secφ) + (4*6 tanθ tanφ) = 0.\n\nSo, 20 secθ secφ + 24 tanθ tanφ = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20 secθ secφ = -24 tanθ tanφ.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 secθ secφ = -6 tanθ tanφ.\n\nHmm, let's express everything in terms of sin and cos.\n\nRecall that secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n5*(1/cosθ)*(1/cosφ) = -6*(sinθ/cosθ)*(sinφ/cosφ).\n\nMultiply both sides by cosθ cosφ:\n\n5 = -6 sinθ sinφ.\n\nSo, 5 = -6 sinθ sinφ.\n\nTherefore, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the product of sines of θ and φ is -5/6.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD² = 4(p² + q²) = 4*( (2√5 secφ)^2 + (2√6 tanφ)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n4*( (4*5 sec²φ) + (4*6 tan²φ) ) = 4*(20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n4*20 sec²φ + 4*24 tan²φ = 80 sec²φ + 96 tan²φ.\n\nSo, BD² = 80 sec²φ + 96 tan²φ.\n\nNow, let's express this in terms of sinφ and cosφ.\n\nRecall that sec²φ = 1 + tan²φ, so:\n\nBD² = 80(1 + tan²φ) + 96 tan²φ = 80 + 80 tan²φ + 96 tan²φ = 80 + 176 tan²φ.\n\nSo, BD² = 80 + 176 tan²φ.\n\nSimilarly, we can express tan²φ in terms of sinφ.\n\nBut we have the condition that sinθ sinφ = -5/6.\n\nAlso, since OA is (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ), and it's on the hyperbola, we can relate θ and φ.\n\nWait, but we might need another relation. Let me think.\n\nWe have sinθ sinφ = -5/6.\n\nAlso, since OA and OB are points on the hyperbola, we can express their coordinates in terms of θ and φ.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a relation between θ and φ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express tan²φ in terms of sinφ, and then use the condition sinθ sinφ = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote t = sinφ. Then, sinθ = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut since sinθ must be between -1 and 1, we have |(-5)/(6 t)| ≤ 1 => |5/(6 t)| ≤ 1 => |t| ≥ 5/6.\n\nSo, |sinφ| ≥ 5/6.\n\nTherefore, t = sinφ must satisfy |t| ≥ 5/6.\n\nSo, t ∈ [-1, -5/6] ∪ [5/6, 1].\n\nNow, let's express tan²φ in terms of t.\n\ntan²φ = (1 - cos²φ)/cos²φ = (1 - (1 - sin²φ))/cos²φ = sin²φ / (1 - sin²φ) = t² / (1 - t²).\n\nSo, tan²φ = t² / (1 - t²).\n\nTherefore, BD² = 80 + 176*(t² / (1 - t²)).\n\nSo, BD² = 80 + (176 t²)/(1 - t²).\n\nNow, let's write this as:\n\nBD² = 80 + 176 t² / (1 - t²).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD² = 80 + 176 [ t² / (1 - t²) ].\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nBD² = 80 + 176 [ (1 - (1 - t²)) / (", "answer": "480"}

Najděte počet obyvatel Aimeville, kteří vlastní všechny čtyři tyto věci.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. \n\nAdditionally, we know that 437 people own exactly two of these items, and 234 people own exactly three of them. The question is asking how many people own all four items. Hmm, wait, but each person already owns a bag of candy hearts, so the four items would be the three mentioned plus the candy hearts. So, we're looking for the number of people who own all four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts.\n\nI think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall how that works. For four sets, the formula is:\n\n|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|\n\nBut in this case, since every resident owns the candy hearts, D is the universal set. So, D = 900. That might simplify things because any intersection with D is just the other set. For example, |A ∩ D| = |A|, since everyone in A is already in D.\n\nWait, but actually, since D is the set of all residents, the union of A, B, C, and D is just D, which is 900. So, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900. But since D is everyone, the union is just D, so the formula simplifies because all the other sets are subsets of D.\n\nBut maybe I should think differently. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, the problem reduces to finding how many people own all three of the other items: diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spades. Because the fourth item is already owned by everyone.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as three sets: A (diamond rings), B (golf clubs), C (garden spades). Each of these is a subset of the universal set D (candy hearts), which has 900 elements.\n\nWe are told that |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562. Also, the number of people who own exactly two of these items is 437, and exactly three is 234. We need to find the number of people who own all three, which would be |A ∩ B ∩ C|.\n\nWait, but the question is about all four items, but since everyone owns the fourth item, it's equivalent to finding |A ∩ B ∩ C|.\n\nSo, let me rephrase the problem: In a universe of 900 people, 195 have A, 367 have B, 562 have C. 437 have exactly two of A, B, C, and 234 have exactly three. How many have all three?\n\nI think I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. The formula is:\n\n|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|\n\nBut we also know that the total number of people is 900, and everyone is in at least one of A, B, C, or none? Wait, no, because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but it doesn't say they own any of the other items. So, actually, the union of A, B, C might be less than 900. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns the candy hearts, but they might not own any of the other three items. So, the union of A, B, C could be less than 900.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and those owning all four. But since everyone owns D, which is the candy hearts, but the other items are optional.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C. Let me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own exactly one of A, B, C.\n\nLet y be the number who own exactly two: y = 437.\n\nLet z be the number who own exactly three: z = 234.\n\nLet w be the number who own all four, which is the same as owning all three of A, B, C, since D is everyone.\n\nBut wait, actually, if someone owns all four, they are included in the count of those owning all three of A, B, C. So, in the counts of exactly two, exactly three, etc., the w is included in the exactly three count? Or is it separate?\n\nWait, no. If someone owns all four, they would be counted in the exactly three count only if they own exactly three of A, B, C, but since they own all three, they are actually in the exactly three category. Wait, no, because if they own all three, they are in the exactly three category, but if they own all four, they are still in the exactly three category for A, B, C. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are for the number of items among A, B, C. So, someone who owns all four would be counted in the exactly three category because they own all three of A, B, C. So, the 234 people who own exactly three items include those who own all three of A, B, C, which is the same as owning all four because D is everyone.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the exactly three count is for owning exactly three of the four items. But since D is everyone, owning exactly three would mean owning D and two others. Wait, no, the problem says \"přesně dvě z těchto věcí\" which translates to exactly two of these things, and \"přesně tři z těchto věcí\" which is exactly three of these things. The \"těchto věcí\" refers to the four items mentioned: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. So, the counts of 437 and 234 are for exactly two and exactly three of the four items.\n\nBut since everyone owns the candy hearts, the counts of exactly two would be people who own the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be candy hearts plus all three others.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of people who own exactly two items is 437, which means they own the candy hearts plus one of the other three. Similarly, exactly three items would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be candy hearts plus all three.\n\nSo, the total number of people is 900, which is the sum of those who own exactly one, two, three, or four items. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, the minimum number of items owned is one (just the candy hearts). So, the total is:\n\nNumber of people owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) + exactly two items + exactly three items + exactly four items = 900.\n\nBut we don't know the number of people who own exactly one item. Let me denote:\n\nLet a = number of people owning exactly one item (only candy hearts).\n\nb = exactly two items: 437.\n\nc = exactly three items: 234.\n\nd = exactly four items: ?\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nBut we don't know a or d. However, we can relate this to the counts of A, B, C.\n\nEach of A, B, C is a subset of the total, and their counts include people who own them along with other items.\n\nSo, |A| = 195 includes people who own A and possibly other items. Similarly for |B| and |C|.\n\nWe can express |A| as the number of people who own A and only A, plus those who own A and one other, plus those who own A and two others, plus those who own all four.\n\nBut since everyone owns D, the candy hearts, owning A is equivalent to owning A and D. So, the number of people who own A is the number of people who own A and D only, plus those who own A, D, and one more, plus those who own A, D, and two more (which would be all four).\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\nFor set A:\n\n- Only A and D: let's call this w_A.\n\n- A, D, and one other: let's say x_A.\n\n- A, D, and two others: y_A (which is the same as d, since that's all four).\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, considering that the universal set is 900, and everyone is in D.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since everyone owns D, the counts for A, B, C are subsets of D. So, the total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is |A ∪ B ∪ C|. But we don't know this directly, but we can relate it to the counts of exactly one, two, three, etc.\n\nWait, the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C is a, which is the number of people owning only D. Because if they own exactly one item, it's only D. So, a is the number of people who don't own A, B, or C.\n\nThen, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which would be people owning D and one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three items is 234, which would be people owning D and two of A, B, C. And exactly four items is d, which is people owning D and all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a (only D) + 437 (D and one other) + 234 (D and two others) + d (D and all three others) = 900.\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nBut we don't know a or d. However, we can express the counts of A, B, C in terms of these.\n\nFor example, |A| = 195 is the number of people who own A, which includes those who own only A and D, plus those who own A and D and one other, plus those who own A and D and two others (which is d).\n\nSimilarly, |A| = (number of people owning only A and D) + (number owning A, D, and one other) + d.\n\nBut the number of people owning only A and D is part of the 437 who own exactly two items. Similarly, the number owning A, D, and one other is part of the 437. Wait, no, because 437 is the total number of people owning exactly two items, which are D and one other. So, the number of people owning A and D only is a part of 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning A, D, and one other (i.e., exactly three items) is part of the 234.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure it.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people owning only D (exactly one item).\n\n- Let b = number owning exactly two items: D and A, D and B, or D and C. Total b = 437.\n\n- Let c = number owning exactly three items: D and A and B, D and A and C, D and B and C. Total c = 234.\n\n- Let d = number owning all four items: D, A, B, C.\n\nSo, a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nNow, the counts for A, B, C are:\n\n|A| = number of people owning A, which includes:\n\n- Those owning only A and D: let's say this is x.\n\n- Those owning A, D, and one other: y (which would be part of c).\n\n- Those owning A, D, and two others: d.\n\nSimilarly, |A| = x + y + d.\n\nBut x is the number of people owning only A and D, which is part of b. Similarly, y is the number owning A, D, and one other, which is part of c.\n\nWait, but b is the total number of people owning exactly two items, which are D and one other. So, the number of people owning D and A is x_A, D and B is x_B, D and C is x_C. So, x_A + x_B + x_C = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, c is the number of people owning exactly three items, which are D and two others. So, the number owning D, A, B is y_AB, D, A, C is y_AC, D, B, C is y_BC. So, y_AB + y_AC + y_BC = c = 234.\n\nAnd d is the number owning all four, which is D, A, B, C.\n\nNow, the counts for A, B, C are:\n\n|A| = x_A + y_AB + y_AC + d = 195\n\n|B| = x_B + y_AB + y_BC + d = 367\n\n|C| = x_C + y_AC + y_BC + d = 562\n\nWe also have:\n\nx_A + x_B + x_C = 437\n\ny_AB + y_AC + y_BC = 234\n\nAnd a + 437 + 234 + d = 900 => a = 900 - 437 - 234 - d", "answer": "73"}

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic definitions. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. So, R = 13 and r = 6.\n\nThe key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That is, the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. So, IA ⊥ OI. That seems like an important piece of information. I need to figure out how to use this.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:\n\nOI = √(R(R - 2r))\n\nBut wait, is that always true? Let me think. I think that formula is derived from Euler's formula in triangle geometry, which states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI = √(R(R - 2r)). So, plugging in the given values, R = 13 and r = 6, we can compute OI.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nOI = √(13(13 - 2*6)) = √(13*(13 - 12)) = √(13*1) = √13.\n\nSo, OI is √13. That's a useful piece of information.\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, the triangle formed by points O, I, and A is right-angled at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nOA² = OI² + IA²\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is given as 13. So, OA = 13. We already found OI = √13, so let's plug that in:\n\n13² = (√13)² + IA²\n\nCalculating that:\n\n169 = 13 + IA²\n\nSubtract 13 from both sides:\n\nIA² = 169 - 13 = 156\n\nTherefore, IA = √156. Let me simplify that:\n\n√156 = √(4*39) = 2√39\n\nSo, IA = 2√39.\n\nOkay, so now I know the length of IA. But how does that help me find AB * AC?\n\nHmm, maybe I can relate IA to other elements of the triangle. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Specifically, the formula for the length of IA is:\n\nIA = √(r² + (s - a)²)\n\nWhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC in this case.\n\nWait, let me verify that formula. I think it's actually:\n\nIA = √(r² + (s - a)²)\n\nYes, that seems right. So, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, and it's equal to the square root of (r squared plus (s - a) squared). So, in this case, IA = 2√39, r = 6, so:\n\n(2√39)² = 6² + (s - a)²\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n(2√39)² = 4*39 = 156\n\nRight side:\n\n6² + (s - a)² = 36 + (s - a)²\n\nSo, 156 = 36 + (s - a)²\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n(s - a)² = 120\n\nTherefore, s - a = √120 = 2√30\n\nSo, s - a = 2√30.\n\nHmm, okay. So, s is the semiperimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2, where a, b, c are the sides opposite vertices A, B, C respectively. So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2.\n\nSo, (b + c - a)/2 = 2√30\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nb + c - a = 4√30\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, I need more relations to find AB * AC, which is c * b, since in standard notation, AB is c, AC is b, and BC is a.\n\nSo, I need to find bc.\n\nI know that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter by the formula:\n\nr = Area / s\n\nSo, Area = r * s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the circumradius R as:\n\nArea = (a b c) / (4R) = (a b c) / (4*13) = (a b c)/52\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for area:\n\n6s = (a b c)/52\n\nTherefore, a b c = 6s * 52 = 312s\n\nSo, a b c = 312s.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Cosines, we can relate sides and angles, but I don't know any angles here. Maybe I can use other relations.\n\nWait, I also know that in any triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me recall that formula.\n\nYes, IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\n3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.\n\nSo, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (√39 / 13)² = 1 - 39/169 = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = √(130)/13\n\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, A/2 is acute, so cos(A/2) is positive.\n\nNow, using the formula for the circumradius R:\n\nR = a / (2 sin A)\n\nWe know R = 13, so:\n\n13 = a / (2 sin A)\n\nTherefore, a = 26 sin A\n\nSimilarly, from the Law of Cosines, we can express a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A\n\nBut I don't know if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Using the double-angle formula:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(√39 / 13)*(√130 / 13) = 2*(√(39*130))/169\n\nCompute √(39*130):\n\n39*130 = 39*13*10 = (507)*10 = 5070\n\nWait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 3900+1170=5070.\n\nSo, √5070. Let me see if that can be simplified.\n\n5070 factors: 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13²\n\nSo, √5070 = √(10 * 3 * 13²) = 13√(30)\n\nTherefore, sin A = 2*(13√30)/169 = (26√30)/169 = (2√30)/13\n\nSo, sin A = 2√30 / 13\n\nTherefore, from earlier, a = 26 sin A = 26*(2√30 /13) = 2*2√30 = 4√30\n\nSo, a = 4√30\n\nSo, side BC is 4√30.\n\nEarlier, we had from the semiperimeter:\n\nb + c - a = 4√30\n\nBut a = 4√30, so:\n\nb + c - 4√30 = 4√30\n\nTherefore, b + c = 8√30\n\nSo, b + c = 8√30\n\nSo, now, we have that b + c = 8√30, and we need to find bc.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for bc.\n\nWe also know that the area is 6s, and the area is also (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52\n\nWe have a = 4√30, so:\n\n6s = (4√30 * b * c)/52\n\nSimplify:\n\n6s = (4√30 bc)/52 = (√30 bc)/13\n\nSo, 6s = (√30 bc)/13\n\nTherefore, bc = (6s *13)/√30 = (78s)/√30\n\nBut s is the semiperimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know a = 4√30, and b + c = 8√30, so:\n\ns = (4√30 + 8√30)/2 = (12√30)/2 = 6√30\n\nSo, s = 6√30\n\nTherefore, bc = (78 * 6√30)/√30\n\nSimplify:\n\n78 * 6√30 / √30 = 78 * 6 = 468\n\nBecause √30 cancels out.\n\nSo, bc = 468\n\nTherefore, AB * AC = bc = 468\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Calculated OI using Euler's formula: √(13*(13 - 12)) = √13\n2. Since IA ⊥ OI, triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OA² = OI² + IA²\n3. OA is the circumradius, 13, so 13² = (√13)² + IA² => IA² = 169 -13=156 => IA=2√39\n4. Used IA formula: IA=√(r² + (s - a)²) => 156=36 + (s - a)² => s - a=2√30\n5. Therefore, b + c - a=4√30\n6. From Euler's formula, a=4√30\n7. Then, b + c=8√30\n8. Calculated area in two ways: 6s and (a b c)/52\n9. Expressed bc in terms of s, found s=6√30\n10. Plugged back in to find bc=468\n\nSeems solid. Let me just check if all steps make sense.\n\nWait, in step 4, I used IA = √(r² + (s - a)²). Is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nYes, the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A is indeed IA = √(r² + (s - a)²). So that step is correct.\n\nAlso, in step 5, s - a = 2√30, so b + c - a = 4√30, which is correct because s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (b + c - a)/2.\n\nThen, since a = 4√30, b + c = 8√30.\n\nThen, in step 8, area is 6s, which is 6*6√30=36√30.\n\nAlso, area is (a b c)/52, so 36√30 = (4√30 * b * c)/52\n\nSolving for bc:\n\n36√30 = (4√30 bc)/52\n\nMultiply both sides by 52:\n\n36√30 *52 = 4√30 bc\n\nDivide both sides by 4√30:\n\n(36√30 *52)/(4√30) = bc\n\nSimplify:\n\n(36*52)/4 = bc\n\n36/4=9, so 9*52=468\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nTherefore, AB * AC = 468.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n</think>\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\).

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a, b, and c are non-negative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. It involves quadratic terms multiplied by the other variables. Let me write it out again:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see. If I factor out common terms, I notice that each term has two variables, one squared and one linear. For example, a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be rewritten as:\n\na²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nThat's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me do that:\n\na²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, now the equation becomes:\n\n300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.\n\nI remember that for three variables, the square of the sum is equal to the sum of the squares plus twice the sum of the products:\n\n(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 300, so:\n\n300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nCalculating 300², that's 90,000. So,\n\n90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = a² + b² + c², and P = ab + bc + ca. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n90,000 = Q + 2P.\n\nSo, Q = 90,000 - 2P.\n\nNow, going back to the earlier equation:\n\n300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me substitute Q with 90,000 - 2P:\n\n300(90,000 - 2P) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nCalculating 300 * 90,000: that's 27,000,000. And 300 * (-2P) is -600P. So,\n\n27,000,000 - 600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000.\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n\n600P + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n600P + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.\n\nHmm, I need another relation involving a³ + b³ + c³. I recall that for three variables, the sum of cubes can be expressed as:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo, substituting S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and let me denote R = abc.\n\nThen,\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3R.\n\nCalculating 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.\n\nSo,\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3R.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n\n600P + (27,000,000 - 900P + 3R) = 21,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n600P + 27,000,000 - 900P + 3R = 21,000,000.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(600P - 900P) + 27,000,000 + 3R = 21,000,000.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-300P + 27,000,000 + 3R = 21,000,000.\n\nSubtract 27,000,000 from both sides:\n\n-300P + 3R = -6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n-100P + R = -2,000,000.\n\nSo,\n\nR = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, now I have R in terms of P: R = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nBut R is abc, which is the product of a, b, c. So, abc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, now I have expressions for Q and R in terms of P. Let me recap:\n\nQ = 90,000 - 2P,\n\nR = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, now, I have S = 300, Q = 90,000 - 2P, R = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nI wonder if I can find P. Maybe I can use another identity or relation.\n\nWait, I know that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S, P, and R. So, if I can find another equation involving these, I can solve for P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use inequalities or think about possible values of a, b, c.\n\nBut since a, b, c are non-negative integers, perhaps I can consider cases where two variables are equal or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the equation 300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, but I already used that to get to R = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the possible values of P.\n\nWait, let's see. Since a, b, c are non-negative integers, and a + b + c = 300, the maximum value of P = ab + bc + ca occurs when a, b, c are as equal as possible.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum value of P is when one variable is 300 and the others are 0, which would give P = 0.\n\nSo, P can range from 0 to, let's see, when a = b = c = 100, then P = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.\n\nWait, actually, when a = b = c = 100, P = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.\n\nBut if two variables are 150 and the third is 0, then P = 150*150 + 150*0 + 0*150 = 22,500.\n\nWait, so the maximum P is 30,000 when all are equal, and the minimum is 0 when one is 300 and the others are 0.\n\nSo, P is between 0 and 30,000.\n\nGiven that, let's see R = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, R must be non-negative because a, b, c are non-negative integers, so abc is non-negative.\n\nTherefore, 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.\n\nSo, 100P ≥ 2,000,000.\n\nThus, P ≥ 20,000.\n\nSo, P is between 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nSo, P ∈ [20,000, 30,000].\n\nHmm, that narrows it down a bit.\n\nSo, P is between 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nAlso, since a, b, c are integers, P must be an integer as well.\n\nSo, P is an integer between 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nNow, let's think about the equation R = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, R = abc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, abc must be equal to 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nBut since abc is non-negative, as we saw, P must be at least 20,000.\n\nSo, let's see, if P = 20,000, then R = 0. So, abc = 0. That would mean at least one of a, b, c is zero.\n\nSimilarly, if P = 30,000, then R = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.\n\nSo, abc = 1,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider two cases: when one of a, b, c is zero, and when none are zero.\n\nCase 1: One of a, b, c is zero.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume c = 0. Then, the equations become:\n\na + b = 300,\n\nand\n\na²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplifying, that's a²b + b²a = 6,000,000.\n\nWhich is ab(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut since a + b = 300, this becomes ab*300 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo, ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, in this case, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nWe can solve for a and b.\n\nLet me write the quadratic equation:\n\nx² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant:\n\nD = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = 100.\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\nx = [300 ± 100]/2.\n\nSo, x = (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200,\n\nand x = (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the solutions are a = 200, b = 100 or a = 100, b = 200.\n\nSo, in this case, when c = 0, we have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).\n\nBut since the variables are symmetric, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nWait, but in this case, we fixed c = 0. So, the solutions are (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200).\n\nWait, but hold on, in the", "answer": "601"}

O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a set F of line segments PQ of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB. I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, then find p+q.\n\nAlright, let me try to visualize this. We have the first quadrant, so all points have positive x and y coordinates. Point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB connects these two points. The set F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is a line segment from some point (p, 0) to (0, q) such that the distance between them is 1.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the equation of segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. That makes sense because when x is 0, y is sqrt(3)/2, and when y is 0, x is 1/2.\n\nNow, the set F consists of all segments PQ where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with the distance between P and Q being 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt((p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2) = 1, which simplifies to p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, for any segment PQ in F, the coordinates of P and Q must satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers such that p^2 + q^2 = 1. These are all the line segments of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB. So, point C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. All other segments from F don't pass through C.\n\nSo, I need to find such a point C on AB. Let me denote point C as (x, y). Since it's on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, y is determined once x is chosen.\n\nNow, for point C to lie on a segment PQ from F, there must exist some p and q such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the point (x, y) lies on the line segment connecting (p, 0) and (0, q). So, the equation of the line PQ can be parametrized as (p - pt, qt) for t from 0 to 1, where t is a parameter. Alternatively, the equation can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, for point C = (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1. But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can write this as x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for point C, we have two equations:\n\n1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n2. x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1\n\nWe need to find x and y such that these equations hold, but the only solution is when PQ is AB itself. So, for all other PQ in F, point C doesn't lie on them.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, we need to find a point C on AB such that the only PQ in F that passes through C is AB itself.\n\nSo, perhaps we can set up the equations and find the point C where the system has only one solution, which is when PQ is AB.\n\nLet me try to write the equations.\n\nGiven point C = (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe also have that x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting y into the second equation:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1\n\nSo, this is an equation in terms of p and q, but we also have p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1\n2. p^2 + q^2 = 1\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations in p and q. For point C, we want that this system has only one solution, which is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to segment AB.\n\nSo, for other values of p and q, the system should have no solution. Therefore, the system should have a unique solution only when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a condition on x and y such that the equation x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 = 1 has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, let's try to solve for p and q in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x/p + y/q = 1, we can write:\n\nx q + y p = p q\n\nSo, x q + y p - p q = 0\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\np q - x q - y p = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nq(p - x) - y p = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's express q from the first equation.\n\nFrom x/p + y/q = 1, we can write y/q = 1 - x/p, so q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut p^2 + q^2 = 1, so substituting q:\n\np^2 + [y / (1 - x/p)]^2 = 1\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can write it as:\n\np^2 + [y^2 p^2] / (p - x)^2 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (p - x)^2:\n\np^2 (p - x)^2 + y^2 p^2 = (p - x)^2\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p, which might be difficult to solve. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for point C, the system x/p + y/q = 1 and p^2 + q^2 = 1 has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, the system is such that when we solve for p and q, the only solution is p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps we can set up the equations and find the condition that the system has only one solution.\n\nLet me denote s = p and t = q for simplicity.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx/s + y/t = 1\n\ns^2 + t^2 = 1\n\nWe can write the first equation as:\n\nx t + y s = s t\n\nSo, x t + y s - s t = 0\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\ns t - x t - y s = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nt(s - x) - y s = 0\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's express t from the first equation:\n\nFrom x/s + y/t = 1, we can write y/t = 1 - x/s, so t = y / (1 - x/s)\n\nThen, substitute into s^2 + t^2 = 1:\n\ns^2 + [y / (1 - x/s)]^2 = 1\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ns^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/s)^2 = 1\n\nLet me set u = s for simplicity.\n\nSo, u^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/u)^2 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - x/u)^2:\n\nu^2 (1 - x/u)^2 + y^2 = (1 - x/u)^2\n\nLet me expand (1 - x/u)^2:\n\n(1 - 2x/u + x^2/u^2)\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nu^2 (1 - 2x/u + x^2/u^2) + y^2 = 1 - 2x/u + x^2/u^2\n\nMultiply out the left side:\n\nu^2 - 2x u + x^2 + y^2 = 1 - 2x/u + x^2/u^2\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\nu^2 - 2x u + x^2 + y^2 - 1 + 2x/u - x^2/u^2 = 0\n\nThis is a complicated equation. Maybe instead of this approach, I can think geometrically.\n\nEach segment PQ in F is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, the set of all such segments forms a kind of envelope in the first quadrant. The point C is on AB and is not on any other segment except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these segments.\n\nWait, that might be a good approach. The envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, if AB is tangent to this envelope at point C, then C is the only point where AB intersects the envelope, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on any segment from F, which is AB itself.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 = 1, and then find the point of tangency between AB and this envelope.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the condition that the system of equations x/p + y/q = 1 and p^2 + q^2 = 1 has a double solution, i.e., the discriminant is zero.\n\nAlternatively, the envelope can be found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0\n\nG(p, q) = p^2 + q^2 - 1 = 0\n\nAnd also the derivative condition, which is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being zero.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J is:\n\n[ dF/dp  dF/dq ]\n\n[ dG/dp  dG/dq ]\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p^2\n\ndF/dq = -y/q^2\n\ndG/dp = 2p\n\ndG/dq = 2q\n\nSo, the Jacobian determinant is:\n\n(-x/p^2)(2q) - (-y/q^2)(2p) = (-2x q)/p^2 + (2y p)/q^2\n\nSet this determinant to zero:\n\n(-2x q)/p^2 + (2y p)/q^2 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(-x q)/p^2 + (y p)/q^2 = 0\n\nSo,\n\n(y p)/q^2 = (x q)/p^2\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\ny p^3 = x q^3\n\nSo, y p^3 = x q^3\n\nSo, from this, we can write (p/q)^3 = x/y\n\nSo, p/q = (x/y)^(1/3)\n\nLet me denote k = (x/y)^(1/3), so p = k q\n\nNow, from the equation p^2 + q^2 = 1, substituting p = k q:\n\n(k q)^2 + q^2 = 1\n\nk^2 q^2 + q^2 = 1\n\nq^2 (k^2 + 1) = 1\n\nSo, q^2 = 1 / (k^2 + 1)\n\nThus, q = 1 / sqrt(k^2 + 1)\n\nSimilarly, p = k q = k / sqrt(k^2 + 1)\n\nNow, from the equation F(p, q) = 0:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1\n\nSubstitute p and q:\n\nx / (k / sqrt(k^2 + 1)) + y / (1 / sqrt(k^2 + 1)) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx sqrt(k^2 + 1) / k + y sqrt(k^2 + 1) = 1\n\nFactor out sqrt(k^2 + 1):\n\nsqrt(k^2 + 1) (x / k + y) = 1\n\nBut we know that k = (x/y)^(1/3), so let's substitute that:\n\nsqrt( (x/y)^(2/3) + 1 ) (x / (x/y)^(1/3) + y) = 1\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nFirst, (x/y)^(2/3) is (x^2/y^2)^(1/3) = (x^2)^(1/3)/(y^2)^(1/3) = x^(2/3)/y^(2/3)\n\nSimilarly, (x/y)^(1/3) is x^(1/3)/y^(1/3)\n\nSo, x / (x/y)^(1/3) =", "answer": "23"}

Here, \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\). Also, the minimal polynomial for \\(\\omega\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\dots + x + 1\\). That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, looking at the product, it's from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 12\\), so that's 13 terms. Each term is of the form \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let me see if I can simplify each term or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write out a few terms to see if I can spot something:\n\n- For \\(k = 0\\): \\(2 - 2\\omega^0 + \\omega^{0} = 2 - 2(1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\\)\n- For \\(k = 1\\): \\(2 - 2\\omega + \\omega^{2}\\)\n- For \\(k = 2\\): \\(2 - 2\\omega^2 + \\omega^{4}\\)\n- ...\n- For \\(k = 12\\): \\(2 - 2\\omega^{12} + \\omega^{24}\\)\n\nWait, but \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{24} = \\omega^{24 \\mod 13} = \\omega^{11}\\). So, the last term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^{12} + \\omega^{11}\\).\n\nHmm, so each term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some polynomial.\n\nLet me consider the expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let me denote \\(x = \\omega^k\\), so the expression becomes \\(2 - 2x + x^2\\). That's a quadratic in \\(x\\). Let me see if I can factor it or find its roots.\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\\) has roots \\(x = [2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8}]/2 = [2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \\pm i\\). So, the roots are complex numbers, which makes sense since \\(\\omega^k\\) are complex roots of unity.\n\nBut I'm not sure if factoring helps here. Maybe I can relate this product to the cyclotomic polynomial or some other polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as a product over all 13th roots of unity, except for \\(\\omega = 1\\). Wait, but in the product, each term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\), so maybe I can write this as a product over \\(k\\) of \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\).\n\nLet me think about the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Since \\(\\omega^k\\) are all the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can express this product in terms of a polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nLet me consider the polynomial \\(P(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k)\\). But that's just the cyclotomic polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\), which is \\(x^{12} + x^{11} + \\dots + x + 1\\). But in our case, each term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\), which is a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\).\n\nWait, maybe I can write each term as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (\\omega^k)^2 - 2\\omega^k + 2\\). So, that's \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). So, the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) evaluated at \\(x = \\omega^k\\).\n\nBut since \\(\\omega^k\\) are all the 13th roots of unity, the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) evaluated at each root \\(\\omega^k\\) is the same as evaluating the product of \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but actually, the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) is a polynomial of degree 26, but since we're evaluating it at each \\(\\omega^k\\), which are roots of \\(x^{13} - 1 = 0\\), maybe we can relate this to the resultant or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) as the product over all 13th roots of unity of \\(2 - 2x + x^2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). So, that would be the product of \\(2 - 2x + x^2\\) for each 13th root of unity \\(x\\).\n\nI recall that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of another polynomial can sometimes be expressed using resultants or using properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nLet me denote \\(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Then, the product we're looking for is \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\\omega^k)\\). Since \\(\\omega^k\\) are the 13th roots of unity, this product is equal to the resultant of \\(Q(x)\\) and \\(x^{13} - 1\\), or perhaps the product of \\(Q(x)\\) over all roots of \\(x^{13} - 1\\).\n\nI think the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\\omega^k)\\) is equal to the resultant of \\(Q(x)\\) and \\(x^{13} - 1\\), which can be computed as the product of \\(Q(x)\\) evaluated at all roots of \\(x^{13} - 1\\). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\\), the product \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n Q(r_i)\\) is equal to the resultant of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), which can be computed as \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n Q(r_i)\\). So, in our case, \\(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\\), and \\(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\).\n\nThe resultant of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is the product of \\(Q(r_i)\\) for all roots \\(r_i\\) of \\(P\\). So, yes, that's exactly our product. So, \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\\omega^k) = \\text{Res}(P, Q)\\).\n\nNow, the resultant can also be computed as the product of \\(Q(r_i)\\) for all roots \\(r_i\\) of \\(P\\), which is what we have. But how do we compute this resultant?\n\nI think the resultant can be computed using the formula \\(\\text{Res}(P, Q) = \\prod_{i=1}^n Q(r_i)\\), which is exactly our case. But maybe there's a better way to compute this without expanding everything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\) can be factored as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\). So, the roots of \\(Q(x)\\) are \\(1 + i\\) and \\(1 - i\\). Then, the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\\omega^k)\\) is equal to \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\nSo, that's equal to \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\times \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\nBut \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a)\\) is equal to \\(a^{13} - 1\\), because \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\\). So, substituting \\(x = a\\), we get \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \\omega^k) = a^{13} - 1\\).\n\nWait, but in our case, it's \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a)\\), which is the same as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \\omega^k)\\) multiplied by \\((-1)^{13}\\), since each term is \\((\\omega^k - a) = -(a - \\omega^k)\\). So, \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \\omega^k) = - (a^{13} - 1)\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1)\\).\n\nSo, applying this to our case, we have:\n\n\\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) = - ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)\\)\n\nand\n\n\\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)) = - ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)\\).\n\nTherefore, the original product is:\n\n\\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\\omega^k) = [ - ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) ] \\times [ - ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ] = [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] \\times [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ]\\).\n\nSimplifying the negatives:\n\n= [ -1 \\times ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] \\times [ -1 \\times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ]\n\n= (-1)^2 \\times [ ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) \\times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ]\n\n= 1 \\times [ ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) \\times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ]\n\nSo, now we have to compute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\).\n\nI remember that \\(1 + i\\) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\), and the argument is \\(\\pi/4\\). So, \\(1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}\\). Similarly, \\(1 - i = \\sqrt{2} e^{-i\\pi/4}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((1 + i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\((1 - i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4}\\).\n\nLet me compute \\((\\sqrt{2})^{13}\\):\n\n\\((\\sqrt{2})^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 \\times 2^{1/2} = 64 \\times \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\n13 * π/4 = (12 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2π, 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4. But wait, 3π is actually 3π, which is equivalent to π modulo 2π, but let me check:\n\nWait, 13 * π/4 = (12 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4. 3π is equal to π modulo 2π, so 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4. So, the angle is 5π/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the other term, -13π/4 = - (3π + π/4) = -3π - π/4. Adding 2π to make it positive: -3π - π/4 + 2π = -π - π/4 = -5π/4. But angles are periodic, so -5π/4 is equivalent to 3π/4 (since -5π/4 + 2π = 3π/4).\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n-13π/4 = - (13/4)π. Let's add 4π (which is 16π/4) to get a positive angle:\n\n-13π/4 + 16π/4 = ", "answer": "321"}

A number \\( n \\) is called \\( b \\)-eautiful if when written in base \\( b \\), it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base \\( b \\). In any base \\( b \\), a two-digit number can be represented as \\( ab_b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits in that base. But wait, actually, the digits are usually denoted as \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\), so maybe I should use different letters to avoid confusion with the base \\( b \\). Let me correct that: a two-digit number in base \\( b \\) is \\( d_1 d_0 \\), where \\( d_1 \\) is the digit in the \\( b \\) place and \\( d_0 \\) is the digit in the units place. So, the value of this number in decimal is \\( d_1 \\times b + d_0 \\).\n\nGiven that, the number \\( n \\) can be expressed as \\( n = d_1 \\times b + d_0 \\). The condition for \\( n \\) being \\( b \\)-eautiful is that \\( d_1 + d_0 = \\sqrt{n} \\). So, substituting \\( n \\) from the previous equation, we get:\n\n\\( d_1 + d_0 = \\sqrt{d_1 \\times b + d_0} \\)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 \\times b + d_0 \\)\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \\)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1 b - d_0 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor or find a way to express this differently. Let me see if I can group terms:\n\n\\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( d_1 \\). For each base \\( b \\), and each possible digit \\( d_0 \\), I can solve for \\( d_1 \\) and see if it's an integer within the valid range of digits for base \\( b \\).\n\nBut before diving into solving this quadratic, let me think about the constraints on \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\). In base \\( b \\), each digit must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq d_1, d_0 < b \\). Also, since it's a two-digit number, \\( d_1 \\) can't be zero; otherwise, it would be a single-digit number. So, \\( d_1 \\) must be at least 1 and less than \\( b \\), and \\( d_0 \\) must be between 0 and \\( b - 1 \\).\n\nSo, for each base \\( b \\), I can iterate over all possible \\( d_1 \\) from 1 to \\( b - 1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\) from 0 to \\( b - 1 \\), plug them into the equation, and check if the equation holds. If it does, then \\( n = d_1 b + d_0 \\) is a \\( b \\)-eautiful number.\n\nBut since I need to find the smallest \\( b \\) where there are more than ten such numbers, I need an efficient way to compute this without checking every possible \\( b \\) starting from 2 upwards, which could take a long time.\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship or pattern that can help me find \\( b \\) without brute-forcing.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\n\\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( s = d_1 + d_0 \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \\)\n\nBut since \\( s = d_1 + d_0 \\), we can write \\( d_0 = s - d_1 \\). Substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\( s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \\)\n\nFactor \\( d_1 \\):\n\n\\( s^2 = d_1 (b - 1) + s \\)\n\nThen, solving for \\( d_1 \\):\n\n\\( d_1 = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\)\n\nSo, \\( d_1 \\) must be an integer, and since \\( d_1 \\) is a digit in base \\( b \\), it must satisfy \\( 1 \\leq d_1 < b \\). Also, \\( d_0 = s - d_1 \\) must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq d_0 < b \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( s \\), \\( d_1 \\) must be equal to \\( (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \\), and this must be an integer. Therefore, \\( b - 1 \\) must divide \\( s^2 - s \\).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n\\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\)\n\nSo, \\( b - 1 \\) is a divisor of \\( s(s - 1) \\). Since \\( s = d_1 + d_0 \\), and \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\) are digits in base \\( b \\), the maximum possible value of \\( s \\) is \\( (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2 \\). The minimum value of \\( s \\) is \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\).\n\nBut let's think about the possible values of \\( s \\). Since \\( d_1 \\) is at least 1 and \\( d_0 \\) is at least 0, \\( s \\) is at least 1. The maximum \\( s \\) is \\( 2b - 2 \\), as I said.\n\nBut let's also note that \\( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \\). Since \\( d_1 \\) is at least 1 and \\( d_0 \\) is at least 0, \\( s^2 \\) is at least \\( b \\). So, \\( s \\geq \\sqrt{b} \\). But since \\( s \\) is an integer, \\( s \\geq \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\).\n\nWait, but \\( s \\) is also equal to \\( d_1 + d_0 \\), which is at most \\( 2b - 2 \\). So, \\( s \\) can range from 1 to \\( 2b - 2 \\), but in reality, since \\( s^2 \\) must be equal to \\( d_1 b + d_0 \\), which is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\), meaning \\( n = d_1 b + d_0 \\) must satisfy \\( b \\leq n < b^2 \\). Therefore, \\( s^2 \\) must be in the range \\( [b, b^2) \\). So, \\( s \\) must satisfy \\( \\sqrt{b} \\leq s < b \\).\n\nWait, that's an important point. Since \\( n \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\), it must be at least \\( b \\) (the smallest two-digit number is \\( 10_b = b \\)) and less than \\( b^2 \\) (since the largest two-digit number is \\( (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \\)). Therefore, \\( s^2 \\) must be in the interval \\( [b, b^2) \\). So, \\( s \\) must satisfy \\( \\sqrt{b} \\leq s < b \\).\n\nBut \\( s \\) is an integer, so \\( s \\) can take integer values from \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) up to \\( b - 1 \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( b \\), the possible values of \\( s \\) are integers from \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) to \\( b - 1 \\). For each such \\( s \\), we can check if \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\). If it does, then \\( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \\) must be an integer, and we can then compute \\( d_0 = s - d_1 \\) and check if \\( d_0 \\) is a valid digit (i.e., \\( 0 \\leq d_0 < b \\)).\n\nSo, the number of \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers \\( s \\) in \\( [\\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil, b - 1] \\) such that \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\), and \\( d_0 = s - d_1 \\) is a valid digit.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers, I can:\n\n1. For each \\( b \\), compute \\( s \\) from \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) to \\( b - 1 \\).\n2. For each \\( s \\), check if \\( (s^2 - s) \\) is divisible by \\( b - 1 \\).\n3. If yes, compute \\( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \\) and \\( d_0 = s - d_1 \\).\n4. Check if \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\) are valid digits (i.e., \\( 1 \\leq d_1 < b \\) and \\( 0 \\leq d_0 < b \\)).\n5. Count the number of such valid pairs \\( (d_1, d_0) \\).\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest \\( b \\) such that this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable, but doing this manually for each \\( b \\) starting from 2 would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet me consider that \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\). Since \\( s \\) and \\( s - 1 \\) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, \\( b - 1 \\) must divide either \\( s \\) or \\( s - 1 \\), or be a product of factors from both.\n\nBut since \\( s \\) and \\( s - 1 \\) are coprime, \\( b - 1 \\) must be a product of factors where each factor divides either \\( s \\) or \\( s - 1 \\). So, \\( b - 1 \\) can be written as \\( k \\times m \\), where \\( k \\) divides \\( s \\) and \\( m \\) divides \\( s - 1 \\), with \\( \\gcd(k, m) = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, since \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\), and \\( \\gcd(s, s - 1) = 1 \\), \\( b - 1 \\) must be a divisor of \\( s(s - 1) \\), but since \\( s \\) and \\( s - 1 \\) are coprime, \\( b - 1 \\) must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing \\( s \\) and the other dividing \\( s - 1 \\).\n\nThis might not be directly helpful, but perhaps I can think about the number of solutions \\( s \\) for each \\( b \\). Since \\( s \\) ranges from \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) to \\( b - 1 \\), the number of possible \\( s \\) is roughly \\( b - \\sqrt{b} \\). But we need more than ten solutions, so \\( b \\) must be such that \\( b - \\sqrt{b} \\) is more than ten, but actually, it's not that straightforward because not all \\( s \\) will satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the number of divisors of \\( s(s - 1) \\). For each \\( s \\), \\( s(s - 1) \\) has a certain number of divisors, and each divisor \\( d \\) corresponds to a possible \\( b - 1 = d \\), hence \\( b = d + 1 \\). So, for each \\( s \\), the number of possible \\( b \\) is equal to the number of divisors of \\( s(s - 1) \\).\n\nBut since we're looking for a specific \\( b \\) that has more than ten such \\( s \\), maybe I can find \\( b \\) such that \\( b - 1 \\) has many divisors, each of which can be paired with an \\( s \\) such that \\( s \\) is in the range \\( [\\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil, b - 1] \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can fix \\( b \\) and count the number of \\( s \\) such that \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\). Let me try to find a way to express this.\n\nGiven \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s(s - 1) \\), we can write \\( s(s - 1) = k(b - 1) \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then, \\( s^2 - s - k(b - 1) = 0 \\). Solving for \\( s \\):\n\n\\( s = [1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4k(b - 1)}]/2 \\)\n\nSince \\( s \\) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\n\\( s = [1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4k(b - 1)}]/2 \\)\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be integer, \\( 1 + 4k(b - 1) \\) must be a perfect square. Let me denote \\( m^2 = 1 + 4k(b - 1) \\), so \\( m \\) is an odd integer greater than 1.\n\nThen, \\( m^2 - 1 = 4k(b - 1) \\), which factors as \\( (m - 1)(m + 1) = 4k(b - 1) \\).\n\nSince \\( m \\) is odd", "answer": "211"}

Each side of the rectangle must lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The Asymptote code provided draws a regular dodecagon and shows three such rectangles. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So, the central angle between each vertex is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That means each vertex is 30 degrees apart from the next one.\n\nNow, the problem is about forming rectangles. A rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths. So, I need to figure out how to form rectangles using these sides and diagonals.\n\nI remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. For example, in a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by connecting every other vertex. But in a dodecagon, which has more sides, there are more possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how a rectangle can be formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if the number of vertices between them is the same. For example, in a dodecagon, sides separated by 6 vertices are parallel because 12/2 = 6. So, sides opposite each other are parallel.\n\nBut wait, in a rectangle, not only do the sides need to be parallel, but the angles also need to be 90 degrees. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned such that they are perpendicular to each other.\n\nGiven that the central angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees, the angle between two sides of the dodecagon is 30 degrees. So, to form a rectangle, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned along directions that are multiples of 30 degrees apart, but specifically, they need to be 90 degrees apart.\n\nWait, 90 degrees is 3 times 30 degrees. So, if I take two directions that are 3 steps apart in terms of the central angle, they will be perpendicular. For example, if one side is along the 0-degree direction, the other side should be along the 90-degree direction, which is 3 steps away (each step is 30 degrees).\n\nSo, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are formed by connecting vertices that are 3 steps apart in one direction and another number of steps in the perpendicular direction.\n\nBut I need to formalize this. Let me think about the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The angles for the vertices are 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.\n\nTo form a rectangle, I need four points such that the sides are parallel to two perpendicular directions. Let's say one direction is along the x-axis (0°) and the other is along the y-axis (90°). But in the dodecagon, the sides are not aligned with the axes unless we rotate it. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the dodecagon is drawn with vertices at every 30°, so the sides are at 0°, 30°, 60°, etc.\n\nBut the rectangle sides can lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle can be either edges of the dodecagon or its diagonals.\n\nWait, in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths. For example, connecting every other vertex gives a longer diagonal, and connecting vertices with more steps in between gives even longer diagonals.\n\nSo, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are formed by these diagonals. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel diagonals that are perpendicular to each other.\n\nLet me think about how to count these rectangles. Maybe I can consider the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the number of directions for sides and diagonals is 12, each 30° apart. But for forming rectangles, we need two perpendicular directions. Since 90° is 3 steps of 30°, so if one direction is at angle θ, the perpendicular direction is at θ + 90°, which is θ + 3 steps.\n\nSo, for each direction θ, there is a unique perpendicular direction θ + 90°. Therefore, the number of such perpendicular pairs is equal to the number of directions divided by 2, but I need to be careful because some pairs might be duplicates.\n\nWait, actually, in a regular dodecagon, the number of unique directions is 12, but each direction has a unique perpendicular direction. So, the number of perpendicular direction pairs is 12, but since each pair is counted twice (once for each direction), the actual number is 6.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If I fix a direction, say 0°, its perpendicular direction is 90°, which is 3 steps away. Then, if I fix 30°, its perpendicular is 120°, which is another direction. Similarly, 60° is perpendicular to 150°, and so on. So, each direction has a unique perpendicular direction, and since there are 12 directions, the number of unique perpendicular pairs is 12/2 = 6.\n\nWait, but actually, each pair is unique because 0° and 90° is the same as 90° and 0°, so we have 6 unique pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Maybe I should think in terms of axes. In a regular dodecagon, the axes of symmetry are 12, each passing through a vertex and the center, or through the midpoint of a side and the center. But for rectangles, we need two perpendicular axes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the number of rectangles as the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides, each pair perpendicular to the other.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the number of pairs of parallel sides is equal to the number of directions. For each direction, there are multiple parallel sides. For example, in direction 0°, there are 12 sides, but actually, in a regular dodecagon, each direction corresponds to a set of parallel sides. Wait, no, each side is in a unique direction, but sides opposite each other are parallel.\n\nWait, actually, in a regular dodecagon, each side has a unique parallel side opposite to it. So, for each side, there is exactly one other side parallel to it. So, the number of pairs of parallel sides is 6, since 12 sides make 6 pairs.\n\nSimilarly, for diagonals, which are longer lines connecting non-adjacent vertices, each diagonal also has a parallel counterpart. So, the number of pairs of parallel diagonals depends on the step between the vertices.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nI remember that in regular polygons, the number of rectangles can be found by considering the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel lines, each pair perpendicular to the other.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the number of directions for lines (sides and diagonals) is 12, each 30° apart. For each direction, there is a unique perpendicular direction, which is 3 steps away (since 3*30=90°). So, for each direction, there is exactly one direction perpendicular to it.\n\nTherefore, the number of perpendicular direction pairs is 12, but since each pair is counted twice (once for each direction), the number of unique perpendicular pairs is 6.\n\nWait, but actually, each pair is unique because once you fix a direction, its perpendicular is unique, but when you rotate, you get the same pairs. So, maybe it's 6 unique pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of it as axes. In a regular dodecagon, the axes of symmetry are 12, but for rectangles, we need two perpendicular axes. So, how many such pairs are there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the number of rectangles as the number of ways to choose two diameters that are perpendicular. Each diameter connects two opposite vertices or midpoints of sides.\n\nWait, in a regular dodecagon, there are 12 diameters: 6 connecting opposite vertices and 6 connecting midpoints of opposite sides. So, total 12 diameters.\n\nTo form a rectangle, I need two diameters that are perpendicular. So, how many pairs of perpendicular diameters are there?\n\nEach diameter has a unique perpendicular diameter. For example, a diameter at 0° has a perpendicular diameter at 90°, which is 3 steps away. Similarly, a diameter at 30° has a perpendicular at 120°, and so on.\n\nSince there are 12 diameters, each can pair with one other diameter to form a rectangle. But since each rectangle is defined by two diameters, the number of rectangles would be 12/2 = 6? Wait, no, because each rectangle is determined by two diameters, but each pair is unique.\n\nWait, actually, the number of rectangles would be equal to the number of such perpendicular diameter pairs. Since each diameter can pair with one other diameter to form a rectangle, and there are 12 diameters, but each rectangle is counted twice (once for each diameter), so the number of rectangles is 12/2 = 6.\n\nBut wait, that seems too low because the Asymptote code shows three rectangles, and I know there are more than six in a dodecagon.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Because in addition to the diameters connecting vertices, there are diameters connecting midpoints of sides. So, perhaps the number of diameters is 12, but they can be categorized into two types: those connecting vertices and those connecting midpoints.\n\nWait, in a regular dodecagon, there are 12 vertices, so 6 diameters connecting opposite vertices. Similarly, there are 12 midpoints of sides, so another 6 diameters connecting midpoints of opposite sides. So, total 12 diameters.\n\nEach diameter can be paired with another diameter that is perpendicular to it. So, for each diameter, there is exactly one other diameter that is perpendicular to it. Therefore, the number of such pairs is 12, but since each rectangle is determined by two diameters, the number of rectangles is 12/2 = 6.\n\nBut again, that seems too low. Maybe I'm not considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing diameters with sides and diagonals. Let me think differently.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. For example, a side connects adjacent vertices (step 1), a short diagonal connects vertices with one vertex in between (step 2), a longer diagonal connects vertices with two vertices in between (step 3), and so on.\n\nEach step corresponds to a different length of diagonal. So, for a dodecagon, the possible steps are 1 to 5, because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, step 1: sides\nstep 2: short diagonals\nstep 3: medium diagonals\nstep 4: long diagonals\nstep 5: very long diagonals (which are actually the same as step 1 in the opposite direction)\n\nWait, no, step 6 would be the diameter, connecting opposite vertices.\n\nWait, actually, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the maximum step before diagonals start repeating is n/2. So, for a dodecagon, n=12, so steps go from 1 to 6. Step 6 is the diameter.\n\nSo, steps 1 to 5 correspond to diagonals of increasing length, and step 6 is the diameter.\n\nNow, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair perpendicular to the other. So, each pair corresponds to a step.\n\nSo, for each step s, we can have a set of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) with that step. Then, to form a rectangle, we need another set of parallel lines with a step t such that the lines are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the central angle between adjacent vertices is 30°, the angle between two lines with step s is 30°*s. For two lines to be perpendicular, their angles must differ by 90°, which is 3 steps (since 3*30=90). So, if one line has step s, the other must have step s + 3 or s - 3.\n\nBut since steps go from 1 to 6, we have to consider modulo 12, but actually, steps beyond 6 would just be the same as steps in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for each step s, the perpendicular step is s + 3 or s - 3, but considering that step 6 is the diameter, which is its own perpendicular? Wait, no, the diameter is a straight line, so it's 180°, which is not 90°, so that's not perpendicular.\n\nWait, actually, the diameter is a straight line, so it's 180°, which is not perpendicular to any other diameter except itself, but that's not useful for forming rectangles.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: for each pair of perpendicular directions, we can form rectangles by choosing two lines from each direction.\n\nSo, for each pair of perpendicular directions (s, t), where t = s + 3 (mod 12), we can count the number of rectangles by choosing two lines from direction s and two lines from direction t.\n\nBut in a regular dodecagon, for each step s, there are 12 lines (sides or diagonals) with that step. However, these lines are not all unique because some are overlapping or coinciding.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each step s, there are 12 lines, but they are all parallel. So, for step s, there are 12 parallel lines, each rotated by 30°.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For each step s, the number of lines is 12, but they are not all parallel. Wait, actually, in a regular polygon, for each step s, the lines are all congruent but not necessarily parallel.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a regular polygon, each side is a line", "answer": "315"}

The list has three properties: the sum of the numbers is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each term means. The sum is straightforward—it's just adding up all the numbers, which equals 30. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order, but in this case, it's a positive integer that isn't actually in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements.\n\nSo, let me think about the median first. If the median isn't in the list, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements. Because when you have an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If that average is an integer, it might not be present in the list. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which isn't in the list. That makes sense because 9 is the mode, so maybe it's not in the middle positions.\n\nWait, but if the median is 9, which is the mode, but it's not in the list, that seems contradictory. Because if 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if the median is 9, but 9 isn't in the list, that would mean that the two middle numbers average to 9, but neither of them is 9. So, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is 9, but they themselves are different from 9. For example, 8 and 10, as I thought earlier, or maybe 7 and 11, but 11 is probably too big because the sum is only 30.\n\nLet me think about the number of elements in the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is the average of the two middle numbers, n must be even. So, n is an even number. Let's say n = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers when the list is sorted.\n\nGiven that the median is 9, which is not in the list, the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers must be two numbers that average to 9 but aren't 9 themselves. So, their sum must be 18. So, the two middle numbers add up to 18. Let's denote them as a and b, where a ≤ b, and a + b = 18. Since they are positive integers, possible pairs are (8,10), (7,11), (6,12), etc. But considering the total sum is 30, the numbers can't be too large. Let's see.\n\nAlso, since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s must be at least two, but probably more. Let's think about how many 9s there could be.\n\nLet me try to construct such a list. Let's assume n is even, say n=6. Then, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. If the median is 9, then the 3rd and 4th numbers must add up to 18. Let's say they are 8 and 10. So, the sorted list would look like: [a, b, 8, 10, c, d]. The sum of all numbers is 30, so a + b + 8 + 10 + c + d = 30. That simplifies to a + b + c + d = 12.\n\nBut we also need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. In this case, if n=6, we need at least two 9s. But wait, in the list I just wrote, there are no 9s. So, that's a problem. Therefore, n=6 might not be the right choice because we can't fit 9s into the list without affecting the median.\n\nWait, maybe n is larger. Let's try n=8. Then, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers. So, those two must add up to 18, so they could be 8 and 10 again. The sorted list would be: [a, b, c, 8, 10, d, e, f]. The sum is 30, so a + b + c + 8 + 10 + d + e + f = 30. That simplifies to a + b + c + d + e + f = 12.\n\nAgain, we need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's say we have two 9s. But in this case, the 4th and 5th numbers are 8 and 10, so 9s would have to be somewhere else. Maybe the list is [9, 9, x, 8, 10, y, z, w]. But then, the sum would be 9 + 9 + x + 8 + 10 + y + z + w = 30. So, x + y + z + w = 30 - (9+9+8+10) = 30 - 36 = -6. That's impossible because all numbers are positive. So, n=8 is too big because the sum is only 30.\n\nWait, maybe n=4. Then, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd numbers. So, those two must add up to 18, so they could be 8 and 10. The sorted list would be [a, 8, 10, b]. The sum is a + 8 + 10 + b = 30, so a + b = 12. Now, we need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear at least twice. But in this list, there are no 9s. So, that's a problem. Therefore, n=4 is too small.\n\nWait, maybe n=5. But n=5 is odd, so the median would be the 3rd number. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. If n=5, the median is the 3rd number, which must be 9, but 9 is in the list. That contradicts the condition. So, n can't be 5.\n\nWait, so n must be even, and greater than 4. Let's try n=6 again, but this time include 9s in the list. Let's see.\n\nIf n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers, which must be 9, so their sum is 18. Let's say the 3rd and 4th numbers are 8 and 10. So, the sorted list is [a, b, 8, 10, c, d]. The sum is a + b + 8 + 10 + c + d = 30, so a + b + c + d = 12.\n\nNow, we need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's try to include two 9s. But where? If we have two 9s, they have to be in the list. Let's say the list is [9, 9, 8, 10, c, d]. Then, the sum is 9 + 9 + 8 + 10 + c + d = 36 + c + d = 30. That's impossible because 36 is already more than 30. So, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the 9s are in the middle. But if the 3rd and 4th numbers are 8 and 10, then 9s can't be there. So, maybe the 9s are in the first two positions. But then, the list would be [9, 9, 8, 10, c, d]. Again, the sum is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are in the last two positions. So, the list is [a, b, 8, 10, 9, 9]. Then, the sum is a + b + 8 + 10 + 9 + 9 = a + b + 36 = 30. Again, a + b = -6, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, so n=6 doesn't seem to work because adding two 9s already exceeds the total sum. Maybe n=8? Let's try n=8 again, but this time include 9s.\n\nIf n=8, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers, which must be 9, so their sum is 18. Let's say the 4th and 5th numbers are 8 and 10. So, the sorted list is [a, b, c, 8, 10, d, e, f]. The sum is a + b + c + 8 + 10 + d + e + f = 30, so a + b + c + d + e + f = 12.\n\nNow, we need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's try to include three 9s. But where? If we have three 9s, they have to be in the list. Let's see:\n\nIf the list is [9, 9, 9, 8, 10, d, e, f], then the sum is 9+9+9+8+10+d+e+f = 45 + d+e+f = 30. That's impossible because 45 is already more than 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are spread out. Let's say the list is [a, b, c, 8, 10, d, e, 9]. Then, the sum is a + b + c + 8 + 10 + d + e + 9 = a + b + c + d + e + 27 = 30, so a + b + c + d + e = 3. Since all are positive integers, the minimum sum is 5 (1+1+1+1+1), which is more than 3. So, that's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the 9s are in the middle. But the 4th and 5th numbers are 8 and 10, so 9s can't be there. So, maybe the 9s are in the first three positions. But then, the list would be [9, 9, 9, 8, 10, d, e, f], which again sums to 45, which is too much.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe n=10? Let's try n=10. Then, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th numbers, which must be 9, so their sum is 18. Let's say the 5th and 6th numbers are 8 and 10. So, the sorted list is [a, b, c, d, 8, 10, e, f, g, h]. The sum is a + b + c + d + 8 + 10 + e + f + g + h = 30, so a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 12.\n\nNow, we need 9 to be the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's try to include two 9s. But where? If we have two 9s, they have to be in the list. Let's see:\n\nIf the list is [9, 9, c, d, 8, 10, e, f, g, h], then the sum is 9+9 + c + d + 8 + 10 + e + f + g + h = 36 + c + d + e + f + g + h = 30. That's impossible because 36 is more than 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are in the middle. But the 5th and 6th numbers are 8 and 10, so 9s can't be there. So, maybe the 9s are in the first four positions. But then, the list would be [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 10, e, f, g, h], which sums to 9*4 + 8 + 10 + e + f + g + h = 36 + 18 + e + f + g + h = 54 + e + f + g + h = 30. That's way too much.\n\nWait, maybe n=10 is too big. Let's try n=7. But n=7 is odd, so the median is the 4th number. But the problem says the median is not in the list, which would mean the 4th number is 9, but 9 is in the list. Contradiction. So, n can't be 7.\n\nWait, maybe n=2? No, because with two numbers, the median is the average of both, which would have to be 9, but then both numbers would have to be 9, making the sum 18, which is less than 30. So, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe n=3? Then, the median is the 2nd number. If the median is 9, which is not in the list, that's impossible because the median is the middle number, which would have to be in the list. So, n=3 is out.\n\nWait, maybe n=1? No, because the median would be the only number, which would have to be 9, but then the sum is 9, not 30.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nSince the median is 9, which is not in the list, and the list has an even number of elements, let's denote the number of elements as 2k. The median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements, which is 9. So, the sum of the k", "answer": "236"}

The conditions are that when you read the numbers from left to right in each row, their sum should be 999, and when you read the numbers from top to bottom in each column, their sum should be 99. The example given is a grid where the first row is 0, 0, 8 and the second row is 9, 9, 1. So, 008 + 991 equals 999, and 0+9, 0+9, 8+1 equals 9, 9, 9, which sums up to 99. \n\nAlright, let me try to break this down. First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell will contain a single digit, so each cell can be 0-9. The first condition is that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.\n\nLet me represent the grid with variables. Let me denote the grid as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\na & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\nd & e & f \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo, the first row is the number 100a + 10b + c, and the second row is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999. So, we have:\n\n100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.\n\nSimilarly, each column forms a 2-digit number. The first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. The sum of these should be 99:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nLet me write these equations more clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n\nEquation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to simplify things. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1 - Equation 2:\n\n(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n100a - 10a + 10b - 10b + c - 10c + 100d - d + 10e - e + f - f\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n90a - 9c + 99d + 9e = 900\n\nI can factor out 9:\n\n9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nSo, that's a new equation:\n\nEquation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nNow, let's look back at Equation 2:\n\n10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nI can rearrange this as:\n\n10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. Then, Equation 2 becomes:\n\n10S + T = 99\n\nSo, T = 99 - 10S\n\nSince S and T are sums of digits, each digit is between 0 and 9. So, S is the sum of three digits, so S can be from 0 to 27. Similarly, T is also the sum of three digits, so T is from 0 to 27.\n\nBut from T = 99 - 10S, since T must be non-negative, 99 - 10S ≥ 0 => S ≤ 9.9, so S ≤ 9.\n\nSimilarly, since T must be at least 0, 99 - 10S ≥ 0 => S ≤ 9.9, so S can be from 0 to 9.\n\nBut S is the sum of three digits, so S can be 0,1,2,...,9.\n\nSimilarly, T = 99 - 10S, so T must also be an integer between 0 and 27. Let's check for S from 0 to 9:\n\nFor S=0: T=99, which is too big because T can be at most 27. So S=0 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, S=1: T=89, still too big.\n\nS=2: T=79, too big.\n\nS=3: T=69, too big.\n\nS=4: T=59, too big.\n\nS=5: T=49, too big.\n\nS=6: T=39, too big.\n\nS=7: T=29, which is still bigger than 27. So S=7: T=29, which is invalid.\n\nS=8: T=19, which is valid because 19 ≤27.\n\nS=9: T=9, which is also valid.\n\nSo, only S=8 and S=9 are possible.\n\nSo, S can be 8 or 9, and T=19 or 9 respectively.\n\nSo, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: S=8, T=19\n\nCase 2: S=9, T=9\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\nStarting with Case 1: S=8, T=19\n\nSo, a + b + c =8 and d + e + f=19\n\nAlso, from Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e =100\n\nWe need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0-9) satisfying these conditions.\n\nLet me note that a, d are the first digits of the 3-digit numbers, so they can't be zero? Wait, in the example, a=0 is allowed because the first row is 008, which is 8. So, leading zeros are allowed. So, a and d can be zero.\n\nSo, a and d can be 0-9.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. a + b + c =8\n\n2. d + e + f=19\n\n3. 10a - c +11d + e=100\n\nWe need to find all possible a, b, c, d, e, f satisfying these.\n\nLet me try to express c from equation 1: c=8 - a - b\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: f=19 - d - e\n\nNow, substitute c and f into equation 3:\n\n10a - (8 - a - b) +11d + e=100\n\nSimplify:\n\n10a -8 + a + b +11d + e=100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11a + b +11d + e =108\n\nSo, 11a + b +11d + e =108\n\nHmm, that's a key equation.\n\nLet me note that a, b, d, e are digits, so a, b, d, e ∈ {0,1,...,9}\n\nSo, 11a +11d + b + e =108\n\nLet me factor 11:\n\n11(a + d) + (b + e) =108\n\nSo, 11(a + d) + (b + e) =108\n\nLet me denote M = a + d, N = b + e\n\nSo, 11M + N =108\n\nWe have M and N are sums of digits:\n\nM = a + d, so M can be from 0+0=0 to 9+9=18\n\nSimilarly, N = b + e, so N can be from 0+0=0 to 9+9=18\n\nSo, 11M + N =108\n\nWe can write N =108 -11M\n\nSince N must be between 0 and 18, let's find M such that 108 -11M is between 0 and 18.\n\nSo,\n\n0 ≤108 -11M ≤18\n\nFirst, 108 -11M ≥0 => 11M ≤108 => M ≤108/11≈9.81, so M ≤9\n\nSecond, 108 -11M ≤18 => 108 -18 ≤11M =>90 ≤11M => M ≥90/11≈8.18, so M ≥9\n\nSo, M must be 9.\n\nThus, M=9, so N=108 -11*9=108-99=9\n\nSo, M=9, N=9\n\nTherefore, a + d=9 and b + e=9\n\nSo, in Case 1, we have:\n\na + d=9\n\nb + e=9\n\nAlso, from equation 1: a + b + c=8\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f=19\n\nWe can write c=8 -a -b\n\nf=19 -d -e\n\nBut since a + d=9, d=9 -a\n\nSimilarly, b + e=9, so e=9 -b\n\nSo, substitute d=9 -a and e=9 -b into f:\n\nf=19 - (9 -a) - (9 -b)=19 -9 +a -9 +b=1 +a +b\n\nSo, f=1 +a +b\n\nBut f must be a digit, so f=1 +a +b ≤9\n\nThus, 1 +a +b ≤9 => a + b ≤8\n\nBut from equation 1: a + b + c=8, so c=8 -a -b\n\nSince c is a digit, 8 -a -b ≥0 => a + b ≤8\n\nWhich is consistent with the above.\n\nSo, in Case 1, we have:\n\na + d=9\n\nb + e=9\n\nf=1 +a +b\n\nc=8 -a -b\n\nAnd a, b, c, d, e, f are digits (0-9)\n\nSo, let's find the number of possible (a, b) pairs such that a + b ≤8, and then d=9 -a, e=9 -b, c=8 -a -b, f=1 +a +b are all digits (0-9).\n\nSo, a and b are digits (0-9), with a + b ≤8.\n\nSo, the number of possible (a, b) pairs is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b ≤8, where a, b are between 0 and 9.\n\nThis is equivalent to the number of solutions of a + b + c' =8, where c' is a slack variable, but since a and b are non-negative integers, the number is C(8 + 2, 2)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nBut wait, actually, since a and b can be from 0 to 9, but a + b ≤8, so the number of pairs is (8 +1)(8 +2)/2? Wait, no, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b ≤8 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 8 of (k +1) = (8)(8 +1)/2 + (8 +1)=? Wait, no, actually, the number is (8 +1)(8 +2)/2? Wait, no, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b ≤n is (n +1)(n +2)/2. Wait, no, that's for a + b + c ≤n.\n\nWait, actually, for two variables, the number of solutions to a + b ≤8 is equal to the sum from k=0 to8 of (k +1) = (8 +1)(8 +2)/2=9*10/2=45. So, 45 solutions.\n\nBut we need to ensure that d=9 -a and e=9 -b are digits, i.e., 0 ≤d, e ≤9.\n\nSince a and b are digits, a can be from 0 to9, but since a + b ≤8, a can be from 0 to8, because if a=9, then b would have to be negative, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, b can be from 0 to8.\n\nSo, a and b are from 0 to8, with a + b ≤8.\n\nSo, the number of (a, b) pairs is 45.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that f=1 +a +b is a digit, i.e., f ≤9.\n\nSince a + b ≤8, f=1 +a +b ≤9, which is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, c=8 -a -b must be a digit, which is non-negative because a + b ≤8.\n\nSo, all constraints are satisfied as long as a and b are digits with a + b ≤8.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1, the number of possible grids is 45.\n\nWait, but hold on, each (a, b) pair gives a unique grid, because d=9 -a, e=9 -b, c=8 -a -b, f=1 +a +b.\n\nSo, each (a, b) pair defines all the other variables uniquely, so the number of grids in Case 1 is 45.\n\nNow,", "answer": "45"}

The variables x, y, and z are positive real numbers. The equations are:\n\n1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nAnd then, I need to express the result as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers and find m + n.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. Since all the equations are logarithmic with base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier to handle. That might help me express x, y, and z in terms of each other or find some relationship between them.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Converting this to exponential form, it becomes x/(yz) = 2^(1/2). So, x = yz * 2^(1/2). Let me write that down:\n\nx = yz * √2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Converting that, we get y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). So, y = xz * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:\n\ny = xz * 2^(1/3).\n\nAnd the third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4. Converting, z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). So, z = xy * 2^(1/4). That is:\n\nz = xy * 2^(1/4).\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of the other variables. It seems like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these expressions into each other to find a relationship.\n\nLet me substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation. So, from the first equation, x = yz * √2. Plugging this into the second equation:\n\ny = (yz * √2) * z * 2^(1/3).\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = yz² * √2 * 2^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute the constants first. √2 is 2^(1/2), and 2^(1/3) is as it is. So multiplying them together: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So, the equation becomes:\n\ny = yz² * 2^(5/6).\n\nHmm, so I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive and not zero), which gives:\n\n1 = z² * 2^(5/6).\n\nTherefore, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). Taking square roots on both sides:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nz² = 2^(-5/6), so z = (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Okay, so I found z. Now, let's find y using the second equation. From the second equation, y = xz * 2^(1/3). But I don't know x yet. Maybe I can express x in terms of z and then substitute.\n\nWait, from the first equation, x = yz * √2. But I just found z, so if I can express y in terms of x, maybe I can substitute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the third equation. From the third equation, z = xy * 2^(1/4). I know z, so let's plug that in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = x * y * 2^(1/4).\n\nSo, x * y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, x * y = 2^(-2/3). Let me note that.\n\nNow, from the first equation, x = yz * √2. We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Therefore, x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nBut we also have from above that x * y = 2^(-2/3). So, substituting x:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, y² * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nTherefore, y² = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).\n\nSo, y² = 2^(-3/4), which means y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Now, since x = y * 2^(1/12), substituting y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).\n\nLet me compute the exponent: -3/8 + 1/12. To add these, find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12 = 2/24. So, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me write them all with denominator 24 to make it easier:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-9/24),\n\nz = 2^(-10/24).\n\nWait, because -3/8 is -9/24, and -5/12 is -10/24. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24).\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let's compute x⁴y³z² first.\n\nExpressed in exponents:\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny³ = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz² = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, multiplying them together:\n\nx⁴y³z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, let's combine -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, subtract 9/8: -2 - 9/8 = -16/8 - 9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x⁴y³z² = 2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking the absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x⁴ = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6). Correct.\n\ny = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8), so y³ = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8). Correct.\n\nz = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12), so z² = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6). Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: -28 -27 -20 = -75, over 24. So, -75/24 simplifies to -25/8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So, m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Converted each logarithmic equation to exponential form, expressing x, y, z in terms of each other.\n\n2. Substituted expressions into each other to solve for z first, then y, then x.\n\n3. Expressed all variables as exponents of 2.\n\n4. Calculated x⁴y³z² by adding exponents.\n\n5. Took log base 2, which gave the exponent, took absolute value.\n\n6. Reduced the fraction and added numerator and denominator.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I think the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of logarithmic equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nWe convert each equation to its exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\\) implies \\(x = yz \\cdot 2^{1/2}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\) implies \\(y = xz \\cdot 2^{1/3}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\) implies \\(z = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4}\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(x = yz \\cdot 2^{1/2}\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[y = (yz \\cdot 2^{1/2})z \\cdot 2^{1/3}\\]\n\\[y = yz^2 \\cdot 2^{5/6}\\]\n\\[1 = z^2 \\cdot 2^{5/6}\\]\n\\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\\[z = 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\nUsing \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) in the third equation:\n\n\\[2^{-5/12} = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4}\\]\n\\[xy = 2^{-5/12 - 1/4} = 2^{-2/3}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\\) into \\(xy = 2^{-2/3}\\):\n\n\\[(y \\cdot 2^{1/12})y = 2^{-2/3}\\]\n\\[y^2 \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-2/3}\\]\n\\[y^2 = 2^{-2/3 - 1/12} = 2^{-9/12} = 2^{-3/4}\\]\n\\[y = 2^{-3/8}\\]\n\nFinally, substituting \\(y = 2^{-3/8}\\) into \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\\):\n\n\\[x = 2^{-3/8} \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[x = 2^{-7/24}, \\quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \\quad z = 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right|\\):\n\n\\[x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\\]\n\\[y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\\]\n\\[z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n\\[-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8\\]\n\\[\\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right| = 25/8\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(25/8\\) is in lowest terms, so \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\).

Najděte délku strany šestiúhelníku.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel. There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.\n\nHmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, but the angles can vary. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That's an important property.\n\nNow, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine extending these sides, they meet at some points to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate these lengths to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of a hexagon can be related to the hexagon's side through some proportionalities. Maybe similar triangles are involved here.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA is length 's'.\n\nBecause opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being made up of three pairs of parallel sides. So, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD extensions, Q is the intersection of CD and EF extensions, and R is the intersection of EF and AB extensions.\n\nWait, actually, I need to clarify which sides are being extended. The problem says the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these sides is extended until they meet. So, AB is extended beyond B and A, CD is extended beyond D and C, and EF is extended beyond F and E. Their intersections form the triangle.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me denote the triangle as XYZ, where X is the intersection of AB and CD extensions, Y is the intersection of CD and EF extensions, and Z is the intersection of EF and AB extensions.\n\nNow, I need to find the relationship between the side length 's' of the hexagon and the sides of triangle XYZ.\n\nI think this might involve similar triangles or perhaps using the properties of parallel lines and the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). Since the sides are parallel, the triangles formed by their extensions might be similar to the triangle XYZ.\n\nLet me try to think about the ratios. If I can find the ratios of the sides of the triangle XYZ to the sides of the hexagon, I can set up equations to solve for 's'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the hexagon as a combination of vectors or use coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place the hexagon in a coordinate system. Let me assume point A is at the origin (0,0). Since it's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, I can assign coordinates to the other points based on vectors.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nWait, I remember that in such a hexagon, the extensions of the sides form a triangle whose sides are proportional to the sides of the hexagon. The ratios might be related to the number of sides or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle XYZ is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, scaled by some factor.\n\nWait, let me think about the intercept theorem. If two lines are cut by parallel lines, the segments are proportional.\n\nSince AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, the extensions will form similar triangles.\n\nLet me denote the triangle XYZ as the outer triangle, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it.\n\nWait, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as a section of the triangle XYZ, with each side of the hexagon cutting off a smaller similar triangle from XYZ.\n\nSo, if I consider triangle XYZ with sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is inside it, each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of XYZ.\n\nWait, but the hexagon has three pairs of parallel sides, each pair parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nSo, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of triangle XYZ.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon can be considered as a section of the triangle XYZ, with each side cutting off a smaller similar triangle.\n\nSo, if I denote the side length of the hexagon as 's', then each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of XYZ and the distance between the sides is proportional.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and the ratios of the sides.\n\nLet me denote the sides of triangle XYZ as a=200, b=240, c=300.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and convex, and opposite sides are parallel, the sides of the hexagon are each parallel to a side of XYZ.\n\nTherefore, each side of the hexagon is a scaled-down version of the sides of XYZ.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a result of cutting off smaller similar triangles from each corner of XYZ.\n\nSo, if I start with triangle XYZ, and from each vertex, I cut off a smaller triangle similar to XYZ, the remaining figure would be a hexagon.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all the sides cut off are equal in length.\n\nWait, but the sides of the hexagon are equal, but the sides of the triangle XYZ are different. So, the scaling factors for each corner might be different.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to use the concept of similar triangles and set up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factors for each side. Let's say that from vertex X, we cut off a triangle with scaling factor k, from Y with scaling factor m, and from Z with scaling factor n.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths cut off from each side should be equal. So, the lengths cut off from sides XY, YZ, and ZX should all be equal to 's'.\n\nWait, but the sides of XYZ are different, so the scaling factors would have to be different to make the cut-off lengths equal.\n\nLet me think. If I cut off a triangle from side XY of length 200, the length cut off is s, so the scaling factor k would be s/200.\n\nSimilarly, from side YZ of length 240, the scaling factor would be s/240, and from side ZX of length 300, the scaling factor would be s/300.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, the remaining sides after cutting off these triangles should form equal lengths.\n\nWait, maybe the remaining sides of the hexagon are proportional to the original sides of XYZ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are related to the sides of XYZ through the harmonic mean or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the side length of a hexagon formed by extending the sides of a triangle.\n\nI recall that in such cases, the side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula:\n\ns = (a*b*c) / (a*b + b*c + c*a)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that formula is for something else. Maybe it's related to the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length s is given by 1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of similar triangles. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle XYZ with sides 200, 240, 300.\n\nEach side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of XYZ, so the hexagon is similar to XYZ but scaled down.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, the scaling factors for each side must be such that the sides of the hexagon are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps the side length s is related to the sides of XYZ through the formula:\n\n1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300\n\nBut let me compute that:\n\n1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 = (3/600) + (2.5/600) + (2/600) = (3 + 2.5 + 2)/600 = 7.5/600 = 0.0125\n\nSo, 1/s = 0.0125 => s = 80.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that formula is applicable here. I might be confusing it with something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the side length s is the harmonic mean of the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe harmonic mean of 200, 240, 300 is 3 / (1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) = 3 / (0.005 + 0.00416666667 + 0.00333333333) = 3 / 0.0125 = 240.\n\nBut that gives s=240, which is one of the sides of the triangle. That might not make sense because the hexagon's side should be smaller than the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the triangle XYZ with sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides of XYZ, cutting off smaller similar triangles from each corner.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths cut off from each side of XYZ must be equal.\n\nLet me denote the length cut off from each side as 's'. So, from side XY of length 200, we cut off a length s, from YZ of length 240, we cut off s, and from ZX of length 300, we cut off s.\n\nBut since the triangles cut off are similar to XYZ, the scaling factors for each side will be different.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factors as k, m, n for sides XY, YZ, ZX respectively.\n\nSo, for side XY (length 200), the cut-off length is s = k*200.\n\nSimilarly, for side YZ (length 240), s = m*240.\n\nAnd for side ZX (length 300), s = n*300.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, the remaining sides after cutting off these triangles must form equal lengths.\n\nWait, but the remaining sides of the hexagon are not the same as the cut-off lengths. The sides of the hexagon are the segments between the cut-off points.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the ratios of the sides.\n\nLet me think about the ratios of the sides of the triangle XYZ. The sides are 200, 240, 300. Let me compute the ratios:\n\n200:240:300 = 10:12:15.\n\nSo, the sides are in the ratio 10:12:15.\n\nNow, if I cut off similar triangles from each corner, the remaining hexagon will have sides that are proportional to these ratios.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so the proportions must adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and set up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factors for the similar triangles cut off from each corner as k, m, n.\n\nSo, the lengths cut off from sides XY, YZ, ZX are k*200, m*240, n*300 respectively.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of the sides of the hexagon, which are the remaining parts after cutting off these triangles, must be equal.\n\nBut the remaining lengths on each side of XYZ would be (1 - k)*200, (1 - m)*240, (1 - n)*300.\n\nBut these remaining lengths are not the sides of the hexagon. The sides of the hexagon are the segments connecting these cut-off points, which are parallel to the sides of XYZ.\n\nWait, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are proportional to the sides of XYZ, scaled by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of the sides of XYZ and the scaling factors.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and the fact that the hexagon is equilateral to set up equations.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle XYZ is formed by extending the sides AB, CD, EF.\n\nEach side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of XYZ, so the triangles formed by the extensions are similar to XYZ.\n\nLet me consider the extension of AB and CD. They meet at point X, forming triangle XAB and XCD. Since AB is parallel to CD, triangles XAB and XCD are similar.\n\nSimilarly, the extension of CD and EF meet at Y, forming similar triangles YCD and YEF.\n\nAnd the extension of EF and AB meet at Z, forming similar triangles ZEF and ZAB.\n\nSince all sides of the hexagon are equal, the ratios of similarity for these triangles should be consistent.\n\nLet me denote the ratio of similarity for triangle XAB to XYZ as k. Then, the length AB = s = k * XY = k * 200.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio for triangle YCD to XYZ would be m, so CD = s = m * YZ = m * 240.\n\nAnd the ratio for triangle ZEF to XYZ would be n, so EF = s = n * ZX = n * 300.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, s is the same in all cases, so:\n\nk * 200 = m * 240 = n * 300 = s.\n\nNow, the key is to relate these ratios k, m, n to the overall structure.\n\nSince the hexagon is formed by these similar triangles, the sum of the ratios should relate to the entire triangle XYZ.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the ratios k, m, n equals 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the lines extended from AB, CD, EF meet at X, Y, Z, forming triangle XYZ. The distances from X to AB, CD, etc., are proportional to the ratios.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and the fact that the lines are parallel to set up proportions.\n\nLet me consider the lines AB and CD", "answer": "80"}

Then Bob writes down all the non-empty finite sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements in set A.\n\nHmm, let me try to understand this step by step. So, Alice picks some set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob is creating all possible non-empty finite sets B where the maximum number in B is one of the numbers in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what A is, or at least the sum of its elements.\n\nFirst, let me think about how Bob is generating these sets B. For each element a in A, Bob is considering all possible subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a} that include a. Because the maximum element of B has to be in A, so for each a in A, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any combination of the numbers from 1 to a-1, and then include a. So, for each a, there are 2^{a-1} subsets where a is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sets B that Bob writes down is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets is 2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 - 1} + ... + 2^{an - 1} = 2024.\n\nSo, the equation we have is:\n\nSum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.\n\nNow, I need to find a set A such that when I take each element a in A, compute 2^{a - 1}, and sum them all up, I get 2024. Then, once I find such a set A, I can compute the sum of its elements.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, but each term is 2^{a - 1}, so each term is a power of 2, but shifted by one. Wait, actually, 2^{a - 1} is just another power of 2. So, 2^{a - 1} is equal to 2^{k} where k = a - 1. So, each term is a power of 2, but the exponents are one less than the elements of A.\n\nTherefore, the sum 2024 can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2. But wait, 2024 is a specific number, so let me see what its binary representation is because binary representation tells us the powers of 2 that sum up to it.\n\nLet me compute 2024 in binary. Let's divide 2024 by 2 repeatedly:\n\n2024 ÷ 2 = 1012, remainder 0\n\n1012 ÷ 2 = 506, remainder 0\n\n506 ÷ 2 = 253, remainder 0\n\n253 ÷ 2 = 126, remainder 1\n\n126 ÷ 2 = 63, remainder 0\n\n63 ÷ 2 = 31, remainder 1\n\n31 ÷ 2 = 15, remainder 1\n\n15 ÷ 2 = 7, remainder 1\n\n7 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 1\n\n3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1\n\n1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\nSo, writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, let me count the number of divisions:\n\n1. 2024 ÷2=1012 r0\n\n2. 1012 ÷2=506 r0\n\n3. 506 ÷2=253 r0\n\n4. 253 ÷2=126 r1\n\n5. 126 ÷2=63 r0\n\n6. 63 ÷2=31 r1\n\n7. 31 ÷2=15 r1\n\n8. 15 ÷2=7 r1\n\n9. 7 ÷2=3 r1\n\n10. 3 ÷2=1 r1\n\n11. 1 ÷2=0 r1\n\nSo, the remainders from last to first are: 1 (from step 11), then 1 (step10), 1 (step9), 1 (step8), 1 (step7), 0 (step6), 1 (step5), 0 (step4), 0 (step3), 0 (step2), 0 (step1). Wait, that seems off because step4 had remainder 1, but in the list above, I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let me write the remainders in order from last division to first:\n\nStep11: 1\n\nStep10:1\n\nStep9:1\n\nStep8:1\n\nStep7:1\n\nStep6:1\n\nStep5:0\n\nStep4:1\n\nStep3:0\n\nStep2:0\n\nStep1:0\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2024 is 11111101000 in binary. Let me check:\n\nCompute 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 1024+512=1536+256=1792+128=1920+64=1984+32=2016+8=2024. So, 2024 is 11111101000 in binary.\n\nSo, the binary representation is 11111101000, which is 11 bits. So, the exponents where the bits are set are positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (counting from 0). So, 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.\n\nBut in our problem, the sum is Sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024.\n\nSo, 2024 is equal to 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.\n\nTherefore, each term 2^{a -1} corresponds to 2^{k}, so a -1 = k, so a = k +1.\n\nSo, the exponents in 2024's binary representation are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Therefore, the elements a in A are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.\n\nWait, because if 2^{a -1} = 2^{10}, then a -1 =10, so a=11. Similarly, 2^{9} corresponds to a=10, and so on, except for 2^3, which corresponds to a=4.\n\nSo, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\nFrom 2^{10}: a=11\n\n2^9: a=10\n\n2^8: a=9\n\n2^7: a=8\n\n2^6: a=7\n\n2^5: a=6\n\n2^3: a=4\n\nSo, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.\n\nNow, the sum of elements in A is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n4 +6 =10\n\n10 +7=17\n\n17 +8=25\n\n25 +9=34\n\n34 +10=44\n\n44 +11=55.\n\nSo, the sum is 55.\n\nWait, let me double-check the binary representation. 2024 is 11111101000, which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. Sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4.\n\nWait, 11+10=21, 21+9=30, 30+8=38, 38+7=45, 45+6=51, 51+4=55. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum of elements in A is 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the elements in set \\( A \\) is \\boxed{55}.\n</think>\n\nAlice chooses a set \\( A \\) of positive integers. Bob then writes down all non-empty finite sets \\( B \\) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \\( B \\) is in \\( A \\). The total number of such sets \\( B \\) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in set \\( A \\).\n\nFor each element \\( a \\) in \\( A \\), the number of sets \\( B \\) where the maximum element is \\( a \\) is \\( 2^{a-1} \\). Therefore, the total number of sets \\( B \\) is the sum of \\( 2^{a-1} \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( A \\). This sum equals 2024.\n\nWe express 2024 in binary to find the powers of 2 that sum up to it. The binary representation of 2024 is \\( 11111101000 \\), which corresponds to the sum of powers of 2: \\( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \\).\n\nEach term \\( 2^{a-1} \\) corresponds to \\( 2^k \\), so \\( a - 1 = k \\), meaning \\( a = k + 1 \\).

Najděte $Q+R$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest four-digit positive integer N with a special property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number becomes divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then compute Q + R.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.\n\nLet me denote the four-digit number N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.\n\nNow, the condition is that changing any one digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. That means:\n\n1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.\n2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.\n3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D must be divisible by 7.\n4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.\n\nSo, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me write these conditions mathematically.\n\nLet me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.\n\nThen:\n\n1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, these are four congruences that N must satisfy when each digit is replaced by 1.\n\nBut wait, actually, each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7, so each of them is congruent to 0 mod 7.\n\nLet me compute each of these expressions modulo 7.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7 because that might simplify things.\n\nCompute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.\n\n1000 divided by 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\n100 divided by 7: 7*14=98, so 100 - 98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\n10 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 3, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\n1 is obviously 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, let's rewrite each condition using these modulo values.\n\n1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6*1 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2*1 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, now we have four congruences:\n\n1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod 7 ⇒ 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7)\n2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7 ⇒ 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod 7 (since -2 ≡ 5 mod 7)\n3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod 7 ⇒ 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7 (since -3 ≡ 4 mod 7)\n4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod 7 ⇒ 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7 (since -1 ≡ 6 mod 7)\n\nSo, now we have four equations:\n\n1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7\n2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod 7\n3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7\n4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nOur variables are A, B, C, D, each digits from 0 to 9, with A ≠ 0.\n\nWe need to solve this system of congruences.\n\nLet me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nEquation 2 - Equation 1:\n\n(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):\n\n3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nSo, 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7 ⇒ B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7\n\nSo, B is congruent to 3A - 2 modulo 7.\n\nSimilarly, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\nEquation 3 - Equation 1:\n\n(6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ 4 - 1 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):\n\n2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSo, 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7 ⇒ C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7\n\nSo, C is congruent to 2A - 1 modulo 7.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 4:\n\n6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nWe can substitute B and C from above.\n\nFrom equation above, B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7, so 2B ≡ 6A - 4 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7, so 3C ≡ 6A - 3 mod 7.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 4:\n\n6A + (6A - 4) + (6A - 3) ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A + 6A - 4 + 6A - 3 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6A + 6A + 6A) + (-4 - 3) ≡ 6 mod 7\n\n18A - 7 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\n18A mod 7: 18 ÷ 7 is 2 with remainder 4, so 18A ≡ 4A mod 7.\n\n-7 ≡ 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, 4A ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nSo, 4A ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 7. The inverse of 4 mod 7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.\n\nSo, A ≡ 6*2 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod7.\n\nSo, A ≡5 mod7.\n\nSince A is a digit from 1 to 9, possible values are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit, so A=5.\n\nSo, A=5.\n\nNow, let's find B and C.\n\nFrom earlier, B ≡3A -2 mod7.\n\nA=5, so 3*5=15, 15-2=13, 13 mod7=6.\n\nSo, B≡6 mod7. So, possible B digits: 6, 13, 20,... but since B is a digit, B=6 or 13 is too big, so B=6.\n\nSimilarly, C≡2A -1 mod7.\n\nA=5, so 2*5=10, 10-1=9, 9 mod7=2.\n\nSo, C≡2 mod7. So, possible C digits: 2,9 (since 2+7=9, next would be 16 which is invalid). So, C=2 or 9.\n\nSo, C can be 2 or 9.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.\n\nWe know B=6, so 2*6=12≡5 mod7.\n\nSo, 5 + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 ⇒ 3C + D ≡ -4 ≡3 mod7.\n\nSo, 3C + D ≡3 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.\n\nA=5, so 6*5=30≡2 mod7.\n\nSo, 2 +3C + D ≡5 mod7 ⇒3C + D ≡3 mod7.\n\nWait, that's the same as equation 1. So, both equations 1 and 2 give the same condition: 3C + D ≡3 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.\n\nA=5, B=6: 6*5=30≡2, 2*6=12≡5. So, 2 +5 + D ≡4 mod7 ⇒7 + D ≡4 mod7 ⇒D ≡-3≡4 mod7.\n\nSo, D≡4 mod7. So, D can be 4 or 11, but since D is a digit, D=4 or 11 is invalid, so D=4.\n\nWait, but from equation 1 and 2, we have 3C + D ≡3 mod7, and from equation 3, D≡4 mod7.\n\nSo, substituting D=4 into 3C +4 ≡3 mod7 ⇒3C ≡-1≡6 mod7 ⇒C≡6*5≡30≡2 mod7 (since inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7).\n\nSo, C≡2 mod7. Which is consistent with our earlier result that C=2 or 9.\n\nSo, C can be 2 or 9.\n\nBut let's check if C=9 is possible.\n\nIf C=9, then 3C + D ≡3*9 + D ≡27 + D ≡6 + D ≡3 mod7 ⇒6 + D ≡3 ⇒D≡-3≡4 mod7. So, D=4.\n\nSo, both C=2 and C=9 are possible, but let's see if they lead to valid numbers.\n\nSo, let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: C=2, D=4.\n\nSo, N=5 6 2 4, which is 5624.\n\nCase 2: C=9, D=4.\n\nSo, N=5 6 9 4, which is 5694.\n\nBut wait, we need the largest four-digit number, so between 5624 and 5694, 5694 is larger.\n\nBut let's check if 5694 satisfies all the conditions.\n\nWait, but before that, let me make sure that in both cases, all four conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut let's first check if 5694 is valid.\n\nSo, N=5694.\n\nLet's check each condition:\n\n1. Change A to 1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by 7?\n\n1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694, yes, because 7*240=1680, 1680+14=1694. So, yes.\n\n2. Change B to 1: 5194. Is 5194 divisible by 7?\n\n5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Let me check: 7*700=4900, 7*42=294, 4900+294=5194. Yes.\n\n3. Change C to 1: 5614. Is 5614 divisible by 7?\n\n5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Let me check: 7*800=5600, 7*2=", "answer": "699"}

Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but at a distance of 6 units from the center of the circle. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) of 6 and a minor radius (the radius of the tube) of 3.\n\nNow, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T is placed on the outside of the sphere, and it's externally tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i. Then, when the torus is placed on the inside of the sphere, it's externally tangent along another circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I need to figure out the positions of the torus relative to the sphere in both cases—when it's on the outside and when it's on the inside.\n\nLet me recall that for a torus, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is important. Since the sphere has a radius of 11, when the torus is on the outside, the center of the torus's generating circle must be at a distance of 11 + something from the center of the sphere. Similarly, when it's on the inside, the distance would be 11 - something.\n\nWait, actually, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii if they are externally tangent. But in this case, the torus is a bit more complex because it's a surface of revolution.\n\nLet me think. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis of rotation. So, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus's generating circle must be equal to the sum of their radii. But wait, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is a surface, so maybe the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is 11 + something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this in coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere is at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is created by rotating a circle in the x-y plane around the z-axis. The generating circle has a center at (6,0,0) and radius 3.\n\nSo, the equation of the torus can be given by:\n\n√( ( √(x² + y²) - 6 )² + z² ) = 3\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii. But wait, the torus isn't a solid; it's a surface. So, the sphere is tangent to the torus, meaning the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius.\n\nWait, no. The sphere is tangent to the torus, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius. But the torus is a surface, so the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 11. Similarly, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 11.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the generating circle of the torus. Let's denote that distance as D. Then, when the torus is externally tangent, the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is D - (R + r) = 11, and when it's internally tangent, the maximal distance is D + (R + r) = 11.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. So, the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center is D. Then, the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface would be D - (R + r), and the maximal distance would be D + (R + r). But wait, R is 6 and r is 3, so R + r is 9.\n\nWait, no, R is the major radius, which is 6, and r is the minor radius, which is 3. So, the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is D - R - r, and the maximal distance is D + R + r.\n\nBut in the case when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11. So, D - R - r = 11. Similarly, when the torus is internally tangent, the maximal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius, so D + R + r = 11.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if D - R - r = 11, then D = 11 + R + r = 11 + 6 + 3 = 20. But if D + R + r = 11, then D = 11 - R - r = 11 - 6 - 3 = 2. But D is the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center, so it can't be negative. So, when the torus is externally tangent, D = 11 + 6 + 3 = 20, and when it's internally tangent, D = 11 - 6 - 3 = 2.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because when the torus is externally tangent, the distance between centers should be larger, and when it's internally tangent, it should be smaller. So, maybe I have it backwards.\n\nWait, let's think about it. If the torus is outside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's generating circle's center is D = 11 + 6 + 3 = 20. If the torus is inside the sphere, then the distance D would be 11 - 6 - 3 = 2. But wait, 11 - 6 - 3 is 2, which is positive, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, the generating circle's center is closer to the sphere's center, so D = 11 - (6 + 3) = 2. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in both cases, the distance D is either 20 or 2.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that when the torus is on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's on the inside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Externally tangent on the outside and externally tangent on the inside? Maybe it's better to think that when the torus is outside the sphere, the tangent circle is on the outer side, and when it's inside, the tangent circle is on the inner side.\n\nBut regardless, we need to find the radii r_i and r_o of these tangent circles.\n\nSo, let's consider the case when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere on the outside. The distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center is D = 20. The generating circle has radius 3, and the major radius is 6.\n\nNow, the tangent circle on the torus will lie in a plane that is tangent to the sphere. The radius of this tangent circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane where the tangent occurs.\n\nWait, let me think. The tangent circle lies on the torus and is tangent to the sphere. So, the center of this tangent circle is at a distance of 11 from the sphere's center. Also, the center of the generating circle is at a distance D from the sphere's center.\n\nSo, in the plane where the tangent circle lies, the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center is D, and the distance from the generating circle's center to the tangent circle's center is R, which is 6. The tangent circle's radius is r_i.\n\nWait, no. Let me draw a diagram in my mind. The sphere is at the origin, the generating circle of the torus is at (D, 0, 0), with radius 3. The tangent circle on the torus is in a plane that is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the sphere's center to this plane is 11, since the sphere has radius 11.\n\nWait, no. The tangent plane touches the sphere at a single point, so the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11. But the tangent circle lies on the torus and on this plane. So, the center of the tangent circle is at a distance of 11 from the sphere's center.\n\nBut the center of the generating circle is at a distance D from the sphere's center. So, the center of the tangent circle is somewhere along the line connecting the sphere's center and the generating circle's center, right? Because the tangent plane is perpendicular to this line.\n\nSo, the center of the tangent circle is at a distance of 11 from the sphere's center, and it's also on the line connecting the sphere's center and the generating circle's center, which is at distance D.\n\nSo, the distance between the generating circle's center and the tangent circle's center is D - 11.\n\nBut the generating circle has radius 3, and the tangent circle is on the torus, which is generated by rotating the generating circle around the axis. So, the tangent circle's radius r_i can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the triangle formed by the sphere's center, the generating circle's center, and the tangent circle's center.\n\nWait, let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- O: Sphere's center (origin)\n- C: Generating circle's center, at distance D from O\n- T: Tangent circle's center, at distance 11 from O, along the line OC.\n\nSo, the distance between C and T is |D - 11|.\n\nBut the tangent circle lies on the torus, which is generated by rotating the generating circle around the axis. So, the tangent circle is a circle in the plane perpendicular to OC, with center T.\n\nThe radius of the tangent circle, r_i, can be found by considering the generating circle. The generating circle has radius 3, and the distance from C to T is |D - 11|. So, the radius r_i is related to these distances.\n\nWait, actually, the tangent circle is a circle on the torus, so its radius can be found using the formula for the radius of a circle on a torus. The radius of a circle on a torus at a distance d from the center of the generating circle is given by r = sqrt(R^2 - d^2), where R is the minor radius of the torus.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The radius of a circle on the torus in the plane perpendicular to the axis is given by sqrt(R^2 - (distance from the axis)^2). But in this case, the tangent circle is in a plane that is tangent to the sphere, so the distance from the axis to the tangent circle's center is something else.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the cross-section. Let's consider the cross-section of the torus and the sphere in the plane containing the axis of rotation of the torus.\n\nIn this cross-section, the torus appears as two circles of radius 3, centered at (6,0) and (-6,0). The sphere appears as a circle of radius 11 centered at the origin.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the tangent point is somewhere on the outer side. The tangent circle on the torus will have its center at a point T, which is at distance 11 from the origin, and lies along the line connecting the origin to the generating circle's center C, which is at (D, 0).\n\nSo, the distance between C and T is |D - 11|.\n\nBut the generating circle has radius 3, so the tangent circle's radius r_i is related to this distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the tangent circle's radius is the length of the tangent from T to the generating circle. So, using the formula for the length of a tangent from a point to a circle: sqrt( (distance between centers)^2 - (radius of generating circle)^2 ).\n\nSo, r_i = sqrt( (D - 11)^2 - 3^2 ) = sqrt( (D - 11)^2 - 9 )\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is internally tangent, the distance D is 2, so r_o = sqrt( (2 - 11)^2 - 9 ) = sqrt( (-9)^2 - 9 ) = sqrt(81 - 9) = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but hold on. When the torus is externally tangent on the outside, D = 20, so r_i = sqrt( (20 - 11)^2 - 9 ) = sqrt(81 - 9) = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2).\n\nWhen the torus is internally tangent, D = 2, so r_o = sqrt( (2 - 11)^2 - 9 ) = sqrt(81 - 9) = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2). Wait, that can't be right because r_i and r_o would be the same, but the problem says they are different.\n\nWait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe tangent circle lies on the torus and is tangent to the sphere. The center of the tangent circle is at distance 11 from the sphere's center. The generating circle is at distance D from the sphere's center, and has radius 3.\n\nSo, the distance between the generating circle's center and the tangent circle's center is |D - 11|.\n\nBut the tangent circle is a circle on the torus, so its radius can be found by considering", "answer": "127"}

The conditions are that each cell can have at most one token, all tokens in the same row must be the same color, all tokens in the same column must be the same color, and if I add any more tokens, it would violate one of these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the constraints. Each row can have tokens of only one color, and each column can also have tokens of only one color. So, if I have a token in a particular row, all tokens in that row must be the same color. Similarly, for columns. Also, the grid is 5x5, so there are 25 cells. I have 25 white tokens and 25 black tokens, but I don't have to use all of them. I just need to place some of them on the grid following the rules.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"některé z těchto žetonů\", which translates to \"some of these tokens\". So, I can use any number of white and black tokens, as long as I don't exceed 25 of each. But the key is that after placing them, adding any more token would violate the row or column color condition. So, the placement must be maximal in some sense—meaning that every empty cell is either in a row that already has tokens of one color or in a column that already has tokens of another color. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nSo, essentially, the placement should be such that every empty cell is blocked by either its row or its column. That is, for every empty cell (i,j), either row i has tokens of some color, or column j has tokens of some color. Otherwise, I could place a token there without violating the conditions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible maximal placements of tokens on the grid where each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal—meaning no more tokens can be added without violating the monochromatic condition.\n\nLet me think about how such a placement would look. Each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But the key is that the placement is maximal, so for every empty cell, either its row is non-empty or its column is non-empty.\n\nWait, but if a row is non-empty, it's either all white or all black. Similarly for columns. So, the grid is divided into regions where each row and column is either entirely white, entirely black, or empty, but such that every empty cell is in a row or column that's already non-empty.\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and the placement of tokens corresponds to edges colored either white or black. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a matrix where each row is either all 0, all 1, or all 2 (empty), and each column is also either all 0, all 1, or all 2, with the condition that every 2 is adjacent to at least one non-2 in its row or column.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating it. Let me think differently.\n\nSince each row can be white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty, but with the constraint that for every empty cell, its row or column is non-empty.\n\nSo, perhaps the grid can be partitioned into four regions:\n\n1. Rows that are entirely white.\n2. Rows that are entirely black.\n3. Columns that are entirely white.\n4. Columns that are entirely black.\n\nBut wait, no, because rows and columns can be empty as well. So, actually, the grid is covered by some white rows, some black rows, some white columns, and some black columns, such that every cell is either in a white row, a black row, a white column, or a black column, but not necessarily all.\n\nBut since the placement is maximal, every empty cell must be in a row or column that's already non-empty. So, the union of the white rows, black rows, white columns, and black columns must cover all cells. That is, the entire grid is covered by these sets.\n\nWait, but each cell is in exactly one row and one column. So, if a cell is in a white row, it's covered by that row. If it's in a black column, it's covered by that column. But if a cell is in both a white row and a black column, that's a problem because the cell would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, actually, the white rows and black columns must not overlap, and similarly, black rows and white columns must not overlap.\n\nWait, that might be the key. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let R_w be the set of rows that are entirely white.\n- Let R_b be the set of rows that are entirely black.\n- Let C_w be the set of columns that are entirely white.\n- Let C_b be the set of columns that are entirely black.\n\nEach cell (i,j) must satisfy:\n\n- If row i is in R_w, then cell (i,j) is white.\n- If row i is in R_b, then cell (i,j) is black.\n- If column j is in C_w, then cell (i,j) is white.\n- If column j is in C_b, then cell (i,j) is black.\n\nBut since a cell can't be both white and black, we must have that:\n\n- If a row i is in R_w, then column j cannot be in C_b for any j in that row.\n- Similarly, if a row i is in R_b, then column j cannot be in C_w for any j in that row.\n- Similarly, if a column j is in C_w, then row i cannot be in R_b for any i in that column.\n- If a column j is in C_b, then row i cannot be in R_w for any i in that column.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tangled. Maybe another way: the intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty, because otherwise, the cell would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. Similarly, the intersection of a black row and a white column must be empty.\n\nTherefore, the white rows and black columns must form a partition of the grid such that they don't overlap. Similarly, black rows and white columns must not overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a bipartition of the grid into four regions:\n\n1. Cells covered by white rows and white columns.\n2. Cells covered by white rows and black columns.\n3. Cells covered by black rows and white columns.\n4. Cells covered by black rows and black columns.\n\nBut since white rows and black columns can't overlap, the intersection of white rows and black columns must be empty. Similarly, black rows and white columns can't overlap.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a bipartite graph where one partition is the rows and the other is the columns. Each row can be assigned a color (white, black, or empty), and each column can be assigned a color (white, black, or empty). But with the constraint that if a row is white, then all columns intersecting it must not be black, and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to choosing certain rows and columns such that the white rows don't intersect with black columns, and black rows don't intersect with white columns.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty, but with the constraints that:\n\n- All non-empty cells in a row are the same color.\n- All non-empty cells in a column are the same color.\n- Every empty cell is in a row or column that's non-empty.\n\nSo, the grid is covered by some white rows, some black rows, some white columns, and some black columns, such that:\n\n- A white row cannot intersect a black column.\n- A black row cannot intersect a white column.\n\nTherefore, the white rows and black columns must form a rectangle that doesn't overlap, and similarly, black rows and white columns must not overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the grid can be divided into four rectangles:\n\n1. Top-left: covered by white rows and white columns.\n2. Top-right: covered by white rows and black columns.\n3. Bottom-left: covered by black rows and white columns.\n4. Bottom-right: covered by black rows and black columns.\n\nBut since white rows and black columns can't overlap, the top-right and bottom-left regions must be empty. So, the grid is divided into two rectangles: top-left (white rows and white columns) and bottom-right (black rows and black columns). The rest of the grid is empty.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the grid is divided into two rectangles: one consisting of some white rows and some white columns, and another consisting of some black rows and some black columns. The intersection of white rows and black columns is empty, and the intersection of black rows and white columns is empty.\n\nSo, the grid is covered by two rectangles: a white rectangle in the top-left and a black rectangle in the bottom-right, with the rest of the grid empty. But wait, is that the only possibility?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the white and black regions can be arranged in a way that they don't overlap in conflicting colors. So, perhaps the white rows and columns form a rectangle, and the black rows and columns form another rectangle, but they don't overlap in a way that would cause a cell to have conflicting colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire grid can be partitioned into four regions:\n\n- A set of white rows and white columns forming a rectangle.\n- A set of black rows and black columns forming another rectangle.\n- The rest of the grid is empty.\n\nBut the key is that the white rows and black columns don't overlap, and black rows and white columns don't overlap.\n\nSo, let me formalize this. Let me suppose that there are k white rows and m white columns. Then, the intersection of these k rows and m columns must form a k x m white rectangle. Similarly, there are l black rows and n black columns, forming an l x n black rectangle. But these two rectangles must not overlap in a way that would cause a cell to be both white and black.\n\nWait, but if the white rectangle is in the top-left and the black rectangle is in the bottom-right, then they don't overlap. So, the white rectangle is formed by the first k rows and first m columns, and the black rectangle is formed by the last l rows and last n columns, where k + l ≤ 5 and m + n ≤ 5.\n\nBut wait, actually, the white and black rectangles can be placed anywhere as long as they don't overlap in conflicting colors. So, perhaps the white rectangle is in the top-left, and the black rectangle is in the bottom-right, but they don't necessarily have to be adjacent.\n\nWait, but if I have a white rectangle and a black rectangle, they can't overlap because that would cause a cell to be both white and black. So, the white and black rectangles must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the grid is divided into three parts:\n\n1. A white rectangle.\n2. A black rectangle.\n3. The remaining cells, which are empty.\n\nBut the remaining cells must be such that every empty cell is in a row or column that's already non-empty. So, the empty cells must be in rows that are either white or black, or in columns that are white or black.\n\nWait, but if a cell is empty, it must be in a row that's non-empty or a column that's non-empty. So, the empty cells can't be in both an empty row and an empty column.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be covered by the union of white rows, black rows, white columns, and black columns. So, every cell is either in a white row, a black row, a white column, or a black column.\n\nBut since white rows and black columns can't overlap, and black rows and white columns can't overlap, the only way this can happen is if the white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form another rectangle, and these two rectangles don't overlap.\n\nWait, but if the white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form another rectangle, and they don't overlap, then the entire grid is covered by these two rectangles and the rest is empty. But the rest must be such that every empty cell is in a row or column that's non-empty.\n\nWait, but if the two rectangles don't cover the entire grid, then the remaining cells must be in rows or columns that are non-empty. But if the remaining cells are in rows or columns that are non-empty, then those rows or columns must be either white or black. But if a row is non-empty, it's either white or black, and similarly for columns.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the grid is covered by some white rows and some black columns, and some black rows and some white columns, but in such a way that the white rows don't intersect with black columns, and black rows don't intersect with white columns.\n\nWait, that might not cover the entire grid, but the remaining cells must be in rows or columns that are non-empty. So, perhaps the entire grid is covered by the union of white rows, black rows, white columns, and black columns, with the constraints that white rows don't intersect black columns, and black rows don't intersect white columns.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\n- Let R_w be the set of white rows.\n- Let R_b be the set of black rows.\n- Let C_w be the set of white columns.\n- Let C_b be the set of black columns.\n\nThen, the conditions are:\n\n1. R_w ∩ R_b = ∅ (a row can't be both white and black)\n2. C_w ∩ C_b = ∅ (a column can't be both white and black)\n3. For any cell (i,j), if i ∈ R_w, then j ∉ C_b\n4. For any cell (i,j), if i ∈ R_b, then j ∉ C_w\n5. Every cell (i,j) is either in R_w, R_b, C_w, or C_b.\n\nWait, condition 5 is that every cell is in at least one of R_w, R_b, C_w, or C_b. Because if a cell is not in any of these, it's empty, but then it's not covered by any row or column, which violates the maximality condition.\n\nSo, the entire grid must be covered by R_w ∪ R_b ∪ C_w ∪ C_b.\n\nBut with the constraints that R_w and C_b are disjoint in their intersections, and R_b and C_w are disjoint in their intersections.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where one partition is the rows and the other is the columns. Each row can be assigned to R_w, R_b, or neither, and each column can be assigned to C_w, C_b, or neither.
