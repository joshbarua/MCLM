So, Katrīt Aja rides her bicycle at a speed of s kilometers per hour. When she does that, she takes 4 hours to deliver the pasta, including t minutes spent at the café. If she increases her speed by 2 km/h, making it s+2 km/h, she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, and still spends t minutes at the café. We need to find out how long she would take if she rides at s + 0.5 km/h. The answer should be in minutes, t, which is the time spent at the café. \n\nFirst, let's parse the information. The total time from leaving to returning includes the time cycling plus the time at the café. So, when she cycles at speed s, the time taken to cycle is 4 hours minus t minutes. But we need to convert everything to the same units. Maybe convert t minutes to hours? Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem says \"ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā\". So t is the time spent at the café in minutes. So when she cycles at speed s, the cycling time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But we need to convert t minutes to hours to keep the units consistent. Similarly, when she cycles at s+2 km/h, the cycling time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, and again the time at the café is t minutes. \n\nSo, the key here is that the distance to the café is the same in both cases. The time taken to cycle to the café depends on her speed. Let's denote the distance to the café as D kilometers. Then, when she cycles at speed s, the time taken to cycle is D/s hours. But the total time from leaving to returning is 4 hours, which includes the cycling time and t minutes at the café. So:\n\nD/s (cycling time) + t/60 (time at café in hours) = 4 hours.\n\nSimilarly, when she cycles at s+2 km/h:\n\nD/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) D/s + t/60 = 4\n\n2) D/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t/60:\n\nD/s - D/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6\n\nSo:\n\nD(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 1.6\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nD[(s+2 - s)/(s(s+2))] = D[2/(s(s+2))] = 1.6\n\nSo:\n\n2D / [s(s+2)] = 1.6\n\nTherefore:\n\nD = [1.6 * s(s+2)] / 2 = 0.8 * s(s+2)\n\nSo D = 0.8s(s + 2)\n\nNow, let's use one of the equations to solve for t. Let's take the first equation:\n\nD/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSubstitute D:\n\n[0.8s(s + 2)] / s + t/60 = 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.8(s + 2) + t/60 = 4\n\nSo:\n\n0.8s + 1.6 + t/60 = 4\n\nSubtract 0.8s + 1.6 from both sides:\n\nt/60 = 4 - 0.8s - 1.6\n\nt/60 = 2.4 - 0.8s\n\nMultiply both sides by 60:\n\nt = 60*(2.4 - 0.8s) = 144 - 48s\n\nNow, we can check this with the second equation to make sure consistency.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nD/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nSubstitute D and t:\n\n[0.8s(s + 2)] / (s + 2) + (144 - 48s)/60 = 2.4\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.8s + (144 - 48s)/60 = 2.4\n\nMultiply all terms by 60 to eliminate denominators:\n\n0.8s*60 + 144 - 48s = 2.4*60\n\n48s + 144 - 48s = 144\n\n144 = 144\n\nOkay, that checks out. So the expression for t is t = 144 - 48s. But we need to find t when she cycles at s + 0.5 km/h. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"Pieňemsim, ka Aja iet ar ātrum s + 1/2 km/h. Atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aiz-clear pastaiga, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\"\n\nSo, we need to find the time spent at the café when she cycles at s + 0.5 km/h. So, in this case, the total time would still be the cycling time plus t minutes. But we need to find t for this new speed. Wait, but t is given as the time spent at the café. Wait, the problem says \"ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\" So t is fixed, regardless of speed? Wait, that can't be. If she cycles faster, the time spent cycling would be less, but the total time (including t minutes at the café) is different. But in the problem statement, when she cycles at s, the total time is 4 hours (including t minutes), and when she cycles at s+2, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) (including t minutes). So t is the same in both cases? That must be. So t is fixed, regardless of speed. Therefore, even when she cycles at s + 0.5, the time spent at the café is still t minutes. But we need to find t?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, we are supposed to find the time spent at the café when she cycles at s + 0.5 km/h. But in the given information, t is the time spent at the café in both previous cases. So t is the same. Therefore, we need to find t, which is the time spent at the café, given the two different cycling speeds. Then, once we find t, we can use that for the new speed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, they mention \"Atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aizaze pastaiga, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\" Wait, perhaps the translation is slightly off. Maybe it's asking for the time spent cycling, not at the café. Wait, but the original says \"ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\" So t is the time spent at the café. So regardless of speed, the time at the café is t minutes. So the total time is cycling time + t. So when she cycles at s + 0.5, the total time would be cycling time + t. But we need to find t? Wait, but in the previous cases, t is given as the time at the café, which is fixed. Wait, maybe t is not fixed. Wait, let's re-read the problem.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Katru rītu Aja Dodas 9 km garā pastaigā un pēc tam apstāja kafejnīcā. KAD viňa iet ar ātrum s km/h, pastaiga viňai aizaze 4 stundas, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā. KAD viňa iet ar ātrum s+2 km/h, pastaiga aizaze 2 stundas un 24 minūtes,ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā. Pieňemsim, ka Aja iet ar ātrum s+1/2 km/h. Atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aizaze pastaiga, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\"\n\nTranslating: \"Katrīt Aja rides 9 km to the pasta place and then stays at the café. When she rides at speed s km/h, she takes 4 hours including t minutes at the café. When she rides at s+2 km/h, she takes 2 hours 24 minutes, including t minutes at the café. Assuming she rides at s + 1/2 km/h, find the time in minutes she spends cycling, which is t, the time spent at the café.\"\n\nWait, now that's clearer. The total time when she rides at s is 4 hours, which includes the time cycling (which is D/s) plus t minutes at the café. Similarly, when she rides at s+2, total time is 2h24m, which is 2.4 hours, which includes cycling time D/(s+2) + t minutes. Then, when she rides at s + 0.5 km/h, the total time would be cycling time D/(s + 0.5) + t minutes. But the problem is asking for the time spent cycling, which is D/(s + 0.5), and to express it as t minutes. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"Atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aizaze pastaiga, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\" So, the time she spends cycling (not including the café time) is equal to t minutes? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe \"atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aizaze pastaiga\" which is \"find the number of minutes she spends cycling\" (which would be t minutes). But in the problem statement, when she cycles at s, she spends 4 hours total, which is cycling time + t minutes. So the cycling time is 4 hours - t minutes. Similarly, when she cycles at s+2, cycling time is 2.4 hours - t minutes. So the distance D is the same in both cases. Therefore, D = s*(4 - t/60) = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60). Then we can set up equations to solve for t. Wait, but in the problem statement, t is given as the time spent at the café. So in the first case, total time is 4 hours = cycling time + t minutes. In the second case, total time is 2h24m = cycling time + t minutes. So t is the same in both cases. Therefore, we can write two equations:\n\n1) D = s*(4 - t/60)\n\n2) D = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)\n\nSet them equal:\n\ns*(4 - t/60) = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n4s - (s t)/60 = 2.4s + 4.8 - (s + 2)*t/60\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n4s - (s t)/60 - 2.4s - 4.8 + (s + 2)*t/60 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(4s - 2.4s) - 4.8 + [(-s t)/60 + (s + 2)t/60] = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n1.6s - 4.8 + [(-s t + s t + 2t)/60] = 0\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\n[2t / 60] = t / 30\n\nSo:\n\n1.6s - 4.8 + t/30 = 0\n\nMultiply all terms by 30 to eliminate denominators:\n\n48s - 144 + t = 0\n\nTherefore:\n\nt = 144 - 48s\n\nSo, same as before. Then, from this equation, t is expressed in terms of s. But we need to find the time spent cycling when she cycles at s + 0.5 km/h. The time spent cycling is D/(s + 0.5). But D is also equal to s*(4 - t/60). So substitute D:\n\nTime cycling = [s*(4 - t/60)] / (s + 0.5)\n\nBut t = 144 - 48s, so substitute t:\n\n= [s*(4 - (144 - 48s)/60)] / (s + 0.5)\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, compute (144 - 48s)/60:\n\n144/60 - (48s)/60 = 2.4 - 0.8s\n\nSo, 4 - (2.4 - 0.8s) = 4 - 2.4 + 0.8s = 1.6 + 0.8s\n\nTherefore, time cycling = [s*(1.6 + 0.8s)] / (s + 0.5)\n\nLet's factor numerator:\n\ns*(1.6 + 0.8s) = 0.8s^2 + 1.6s\n\nSo, time cycling = (0.8s^2 + 1.6s) / (s + 0.5)\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n0.8s(s + 2)\n\nSo,\n\ntime cycling = 0.8s(s + 2) / (s + 0.5)\n\nBut we need to express this time in minutes. However, the problem says \"Atrodiet minūšu skaitu, ko viňai aizaze pastaiga, ieskaitot t minūtes,kas pavaides kafejnīcā.\" Which sounds like the time spent cycling is t minutes. But that contradicts unless t is both the time at the café and the time cycling. Wait, maybe there is a misinterpretation here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the time spent cycling when she rides at s + 0.5 km/h, and to express it in terms of t. But since t is already defined as the time spent at the café in both previous cases,", "answer": "204"}

The circle's equation isn't given, but since it's a triangle inscribed in it, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at a point D. The line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties related to circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. The tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB = DC. Also, when a line passes through a point outside a circle and intersects the circle at two points, the product of the lengths from the external point to each intersection point is equal for any two such lines (Power of a Point theorem). That might come in handy here.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me check if this triangle is valid. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC = 10. Similarly, other sides satisfy the triangle inequality, so the triangle exists.\n\nSince ABC is inscribed in the circumcircle ω, point P is another intersection point of AD with ω. So AD is a secant line passing through A and D, intersecting ω at A and P. Wait, but A is already on ω, so AD is a secant from D through A to P. But in the problem statement, it says \"the line AD intersects ω at point P\". Since A is on ω, P must be the other intersection point. So AP is the length from A to P along the circle. Wait, but AP is a chord of the circle? Or is AP a secant line? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the line AD intersects ω at A and P. So AP is the length of the chord from A to P. But since A is on ω, the line AD passes through A and intersects ω again at P. Therefore, AP is the length of the chord between A and P. However, depending on the position of D, P could be on the other side of A. But since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, which are outside the circle, so D is outside the circle. Then, the secant from D through A would pass through A and P, with P being another point on the circle. So AP is the length from A to P along the circle, but since AP is a chord, it's just the straight-line distance? Wait, but chords are straight lines, so yes, AP is the chord length from A to P.\n\nBut maybe I need to use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent length from D to ω. Since DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω, then power of D is DB² = DC². Also, since D lies on the intersection of tangents at B and C, we can compute DB and DC in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a harmonic division or something with the polars, but that might be more advanced. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Also, since D lies outside the circle, the power of D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Wait, but since P is on the line AD, DA * DP would be the power of D, which is equal to DB². Wait, but DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But if A is between D and P, then DA * DP would be equal to DB². If P is on the extension beyond A, then DA * DP would still be equal to DB², but with DA and DP being signed lengths. Hmm, maybe I need to consider directed lengths here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry would work here. Let me try to set up coordinate axes. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0), point C at (9,0), since BC = 9. Then, points A, B, and C form a triangle with AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me find the coordinates of point A.\n\nUsing coordinates: Let’s denote B as (0,0), C as (9,0). Let’s let A be at (x,y). Then, AB = 5, so the distance from A to B is sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = sqrt(x² + y²) = 5. Similarly, AC = 10, so distance from A to C is sqrt((x - 9)^2 + y²) = 10. So we have two equations:\n\n1. x² + y² = 25 (from AB = 5)\n2. (x - 9)^2 + y² = 100 (from AC = 10)\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y² - x² - y² = 100 - 25 => x² - 18x + 81 - x² = 75 => -18x + 81 = 75 => -18x = -6 => x = 6/18 = 1/3.\n\nThen, substituting x = 1/3 into equation 1: (1/3)^2 + y² = 25 => 1/9 + y² = 25 => y² = 25 - 1/9 = 225/9 - 1/9 = 224/9 => y = ±√(224/9) = ±(√224)/3 = ±(4√14)/3.\n\nSince the triangle is in a plane, we can choose the positive y-coordinate for point A, so A is at (1/3, 4√14/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB: (0, 0)\nC: (9, 0)\nA: (1/3, 4√14/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω. Then, find their intersection point D. Then, find the equation of line AD, find its other intersection point P with ω, and compute AP.\n\nFirst, let's find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. To find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection.\n\nLet's compute the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC.\n\nWait, coordinates of A: (1/3, 4√14/3), B: (0,0), C: (9,0).\n\nFirst, find the midpoint of AB: midpoint M1 = ((0 + 1/3)/2, (0 + 4√14/3)/2) = (1/6, 2√14/3).\n\nThe slope of AB: (4√14/3 - 0)/(1/3 - 0) = (4√14/3)/(1/3) = 4√14. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope -1/(4√14).\n\nSimilarly, midpoint of AC: midpoint M2 = ((1/3 + 9)/2, (4√14/3 + 0)/2) = ((28/3)/2, (4√14/3)/2) = (14/3, 2√14/3).\n\nSlope of AC: (4√14/3 - 0)/(1/3 - 9) = (4√14/3)/(-26/3) = -4√14/26 = -2√14/13. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC has slope 13/(2√14).\n\nNow, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB: passing through M1 (1/6, 2√14/3) with slope -1/(4√14).\n\nUsing point-slope form:\n\ny - 2√14/3 = (-1)/(4√14)(x - 1/6)\n\nSimilarly, equation of perpendicular bisector of AC: passing through M2 (14/3, 2√14/3) with slope 13/(2√14).\n\nPoint-slope form:\n\ny - 2√14/3 = (13)/(2√14)(x - 14/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection point of these two perpendicular bisectors, which is the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.\n\nLet me solve these two equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\ny = (-1)/(4√14)(x - 1/6) + 2√14/3\n\nSecond equation:\n\ny = (13)/(2√14)(x - 14/3) + 2√14/3\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(-1)/(4√14)(x - 1/6) + 2√14/3 = (13)/(2√14)(x - 14/3) + 2√14/3\n\nSubtract 2√14/3 from both sides:\n\n(-1)/(4√14)(x - 1/6) = (13)/(2√14)(x - 14/3)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4√14 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-1*(x - 1/6) = 26*(x - 14/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n- x + 1/6 = 26x - 26*(14/3)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n- x + 1/6 - 26x + 26*(14/3) = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-27x + (1/6 + 26*(14/3)) = 0\n\nCompute 26*(14/3) = (364)/3\n\nSo:\n\n-27x + (1/6 + 364/3) = 0\n\nConvert 1/6 to 1/6 and 364/3 to 728/6:\n\n-27x + (1 + 728)/6 = 0 => -27x + 729/6 = 0 => -27x + 243/2 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n-27x = -243/2 => x = (-243/2)/(-27) = (243/2)/27 = 243/(2*27) = 243/54 = 4.5 = 9/2\n\nSo x = 9/2. Now plug back into one of the equations to find y.\n\nUse the first equation:\n\ny = (-1)/(4√14)(9/2 - 1/6) + 2√14/3\n\nCompute 9/2 - 1/6 = (27/6 - 1/6) = 26/6 = 13/3\n\nSo:\n\ny = (-1)/(4√14)*(13/3) + 2√14/3 = (-13)/(12√14) + 2√14/3\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\nMultiply the second term by (12√14)/(12√14):\n\n= (-13)/(12√14) + (2√14 * 12√14)/(3 * 12√14) = (-13)/(12√14) + (24*14)/(36√14) = (-13)/(12√14) + (336)/(36√14)\n\nSimplify:\n\n336/36 = 28/3, so:\n\n= (-13)/(12√14) + 28/(3√14) = (-13)/(12√14) + (112)/(12√14) = (99)/(12√14) = (33)/(4√14)\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\n33/(4√14) * (√14/√14) = 33√14/(4*14) = 33√14/56\n\nSo the circumcenter O is at (9/2, 33√14/56).\n\nNow, the circumradius R can be computed as the distance from O to any vertex, say O to B (0,0):\n\nDistance squared: (9/2 - 0)^2 + (33√14/56 - 0)^2 = (81/4) + (33² * 14)/(56²)\n\nFirst compute 33² = 1089, 14 remains, 56² = 3136\n\nSo:\n\n81/4 + (1089 * 14)/3136 = 81/4 + (15246)/3136\n\nConvert 81/4 to 6561/3136 (since 4*784=3136, 81*784=64512, but wait, 81/4 = (81*784)/(4*784) = 64512/3136.

Hmm, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, compute both terms:\n\n81/4 = 20.25\n\n(15246)/3136 ≈ 15246 ÷ 3136 ≈ 4.853\n\nSo total ≈ 20.25 + 4.853 ≈ 2", "answer": "113"}

The question is asking for the number of intersection points between the two curves:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nwhere \\( f(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{2}| \\) and \\( g(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}| \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of these functions. Both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are nested absolute value functions, which typically create V-shaped graphs or diamond shapes. Let's break down each function first.\n\nStarting with \\( f(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{2}| \\). Let's analyze this:\n\n1. The innermost function is \\( |x| \\), which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0).\n2. Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\): \\( |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\). This shifts the graph down by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), so the vertex is at (0, -0.5). However, since we are dealing with absolute values, any part of the graph below the x-axis will be reflected back up.\n3. Taking the absolute value of that result: \\( ||x| - \\frac{1}{2}| \\). So wherever \\( |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\) is negative (i.e., between \\( x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\)), it gets reflected above the x-axis. The graph of \\( f(x) \\) will have a W-shape with minima at \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\) and a maximum at \\( x = 0 \\). Specifically, at \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = ||0| - \\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2} \\). At \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( f(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}) = || \\frac{1}{2} | - \\frac{1}{2} | = 0. So the graph is a V on either side of \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\), connecting back to the central point at (0, 0.5). Wait, actually, let me sketch it mentally again.\n\nWait, when \\( |x| \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\geq 0 \\), so \\( f(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\). When \\( |x| < \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( |x| - \\frac{1}{2} < 0 \\), so \\( f(x) = -(|x| - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} - |x| \\). Therefore, the graph of \\( f(x) \\) is a diamond (a \"W\" shape rotated 180 degrees) with vertices at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\), both at y = 0, and a peak at x = 0, y = 0.5. So it's a diamond shape with its points at (-0.5, 0), (0, 0.5), and (0.5, 0). That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, \\( g(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}| \\). Let's analyze this:\n\n1. Innermost is \\( |x| \\).\n2. Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\): \\( |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n3. Take absolute value: \\( ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}| \\).\n\nSo similar to \\( f(x) \\), but with the threshold at \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). So when \\( |x| \\geq \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( g(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\). When \\( |x| < \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( g(x) = \\frac{1}{4} - |x| \\). Therefore, the graph of \\( g(x) \\) is a diamond with vertices at \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{4} \\), y = 0, and a peak at x = 0, y = 0.25.\n\nNow, moving to the functions \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\).\n\nLet's first understand each function's structure.\n\nStarting with \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\):\n\n1. The innermost function is \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), which is a sine wave with period \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), oscillating between -1 and 1.\n2. Apply \\( f \\) to it: \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = ||\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2}| \\). As established earlier, \\( f \\) transforms any value between -1 and 1 into a diamond shape between 0 and 0.5. Specifically, since \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\) ranges from 0 to 1, \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\) ranges from \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Taking absolute value gives \\( ||\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2}| \\) which ranges from 0 to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Then multiplying by 4 gives \\( y \\) ranging from 0 to 2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check:\n\nWait, \\( g(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}| \\), so when we compute \\( g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\), which is \\( || f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) | - \\frac{1}{4} | \\). But \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) is \\( || \\sin(2\\pi x) | - \\frac{1}{2} | \\), which is between 0 and 0.5. Then, subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) gives between \\( -0.25 \\) and \\( 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \\). Taking absolute value gives between 0 and 0.25. Then multiplying by 4 gives \\( y \\) between 0 and 1. Wait, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, step by step:\n\n1. Start with \\( x \\).\n2. Compute \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\): this is a sine wave with period 0.5, amplitude 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.\n3. Take absolute value: \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\). This gives a waveform that's the absolute value of the sine wave, so it's a series of humps between 0 and 1, repeating every 0.5 units.\n4. Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\): \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\). This shifts the graph down by 0.5. The maximum becomes \\( 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\), and the minimum becomes \\( 0 - 0.5 = -0.5 \\). So now the function ranges from -0.5 to 0.5.\n5. Take absolute value: \\( ||\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} | \\). This reflects any negative parts (i.e., when \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| < 0.5 \\)) above the x-axis. So for \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\geq 0.5 \\), the value is \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - 0.5 \\), which is non-negative. For \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| < 0.5 \\), it becomes \\( 0.5 - |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\). Therefore, the outputs of \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) range from 0 to 0.5. Specifically, the maximum value is 0.5 (when \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1 \\)), and the minimum is 0 (when \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 0.5 \\)). So \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 0.5, with peaks at the points where \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1 \\) (i.e., x = integers) and 0 where \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 0.5 \\) (i.e., x = 0.25 + integers).\n\n6. Then, apply \\( g \\) to this result: \\( g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) = || f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) | - \\frac{1}{4} | \\). Since \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) ranges from 0 to 0.5, subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) gives \\( [0 - 0.25, 0.5 - 0.25] = [-0.25, 0.25] \\). Taking absolute value gives \\( [0, 0.25] \\). Then multiplying by 4 gives \\( y \\) in [0, 1].\n\nSo \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) is a function that maps the original sine wave, through these transformations, into a range between 0 and 1. The key here is that this is a highly transformed sine wave, with the exact shape determined by the nested absolute values and shifts.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation is \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Let's analyze this:\n\n1. Start with \\( y \\).\n2. Compute \\( \\cos(3\\pi y) \\): this is a cosine wave with period \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), oscillating between -1 and 1.\n3. Take absolute value: \\( |\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\). This is similar to the sine wave but shifted. The period is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), so it repeats every \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) units.\n4. Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\): \\( |\\cos(3\\pi y)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\), which ranges from -0.5 to 0.5.\n5. Take absolute value: \\( ||\\cos(3\\pi y)| - \\frac{1}{2} | \\), which ranges from 0 to 0.5.\n6. Apply \\( g \\): \\( g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) = || f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) | - \\frac{1}{4} | \\), which ranges from 0 to 0.25. Then multiplying by 4 gives \\( x \\) in [0, 1].\n\nSo both equations \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\) are functions that map real numbers x and y into [0,1], respectively. However, since they are functions of x and y with periodic components, their graphs will be periodic and oscillatory within the [0,1] range.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of intersection points between these two curves. Since both x and y are confined to [0,1], the intersection points must lie within the square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nfor x and y in [0,1].\n\nGiven the complexity of these functions, analytically solving them might be challenging. Instead, we can analyze the symmetry, periodicity, and possible number of solutions.\n\nFirst, note that both functions are periodic. Let's check their periods.\n\nFor \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\):\n\n- The innermost function is \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), which has period 0.5. Therefore, the entire function \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) will have period 0.5.\n\nFor \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\):\n\n- The innermost function is \\( \\cos(3\\pi y) \\), which has period \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Therefore, the entire function \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\) will have period \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nSince both functions are periodic with different periods, their graphs will repeat every 0.5 and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) units, respectively. However, since we are only considering x and y in [0,1], we can analyze the behavior within this interval.\n\nBut since the equations are symmetric in a way (x and y are swapped in the second equation), maybe there's some symmetry we can exploit.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y are both in [0,1], and the functions are transformations of sine and cosine with different frequencies, perhaps we can parametrize x and y in terms of each other and find fixed points.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting one equation into the other.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\). Let's denote this as equation (1).\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Let's denote this as equation (2).\n\nIf we substitute equation (1) into equation (2), we get:\n\n\\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))))) \\)\n\nThis looks very complicated. Similarly, substituting equation (2) into equation (1) would also be messy. Therefore, analytical substitution might not be feasible.\n\nInstead, perhaps we can analyze the number of solutions by considering the number of times the two functions intersect within the interval [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nGiven the periodic nature of both functions, let's consider the number of oscillations in [", "answer": "385"}

Then, once I find that prime p, I need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is also divisible by p². \n\nLet me start by understanding the first part. The problem is asking for the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once p is found, I need to find the minimal m for that same p. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the first part. Let's recall that if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p as well, since p divides p². Therefore, n² must be a square root of -1 mod p. Because (n²)² ≡ -1 mod p. So, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. \n\nIt is known that x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4 or p = 2. Because for p = 2, we can check directly: 1² ≡ 1 mod 2 and 0² ≡ 0 mod 2. But -1 mod 2 is 1, so 1² ≡ 1 mod 2, which is -1 mod 2. So p = 2 works. For primes p > 2, x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. \n\nTherefore, primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 4 or p = 2. So, the primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is possible. But the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ + 1. So even if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, we need to check whether this congruence can be lifted to mod p² using Hensel's lemma or some other method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, first, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Let me first check primes p ≡ 1 mod 4 and p = 2. \n\nLet me test p = 2. Let's see if there exists n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Let's check n even: n is even, n⁴ is 0 mod 16, so n⁴ + 1 ≡ 1 mod 16. If n is odd, n is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ is 1 mod 16. Therefore, n⁴ + 1 is 2 mod 16. So, n⁴ + 1 is either 1 or 2 mod 16. So, 4 divides n⁴ + 1 only if n is odd, but n⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 16. So 4 divides 2 mod 16? No, 2 mod 16 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, 4 does not divide n⁴ + 1 for any odd n. Wait, but 16 divides n⁴ + 1 only if n is odd, but even 4 does not divide it. Therefore, p = 2 is not possible? Wait, but maybe higher powers. Let me check n = 1: 1⁴ + 1 = 2, which is 2 mod 4, so 4 does not divide 2. n = 3: 81 + 1 = 82, which is 2 mod 4. Similarly, 5⁴ + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is 2 mod 4. So, seems like for p = 2, there is no n such that 4 divides n⁴ + 1. Therefore, p = 2 is out. \n\nSo, moving on to primes p ≡ 1 mod 4. Let's take the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 4, which are 5, 13, 17, etc. Let's check p = 5 first. \n\nWe need to see if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's check some numbers. Let's compute n⁴ mod 25. For n from 1 to 24. Let's see:\n\nFirst, n = 1: 1⁴ = 1 mod 25\nn = 2: 16 mod 25\nn = 3: 81 mod 25 = 6\nn = 4: 256 mod 25 = 6\nWait, n = 4: 4⁴ = 256, which is 6 mod 25. Similarly, n = 5: 0 mod 25. \n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Let me compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 12, since 13 to 24 will be symmetric.\n\nn=1: 1\nn=2: 16\nn=3: 81 - 3*25 = 81 - 75 = 6\nn=4: 256 - 10*25 = 256 - 250 = 6\nn=5: 0\nn=6: 1296 mod 25: 1296 - 51*25 = 1296 - 1275 = 21\nn=7: 7⁴ = 2401 mod 25: 2401 - 96*25 = 2401 - 2400 = 1\nn=8: 8⁴ = 4096 mod 25: 4096 - 163*25 = 4096 - 4075 = 21\nn=9: 9⁴ = 6561 mod 25: 6561 - 262*25 = 6561 - 6550 = 11\nn=10: 0\nn=11: 11⁴ = (11²)² = 121² mod 25. 121 mod 25 = 21, so 21² = 441 mod 25 = 16\nn=12: 12⁴ = (144)² mod 25. 144 mod 25 = 19, 19² = 361 mod 25 = 11\n\nSo, n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 12: 1,16,6,6,0,21,1,21,11,0,16,11. \n\nLooking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25, which is 24 mod 25. But in the list above, the possible residues are 0,1,6,11,16,21. 24 is not present. Therefore, p = 5 does not work. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25 has no solution. Therefore, p = 5 is out.\n\nNext prime p ≡ 1 mod 4 is 13. Let's check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 169. This might be tedious. Let me see if there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Hensel's lemma. If we can lift the solution from mod p to mod p². \n\nGiven that for p ≡ 1 mod 4, there exists a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p. Let me denote a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p as a. Then, we can try to find a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p². \n\nSuppose we have x = a + kp, where k is an integer. Then, x² = (a + kp)² = a² + 2akp + k²p² ≡ a² + 2akp mod p². Since a² ≡ -1 mod p, we have a² = -1 + mp for some integer m. Therefore, x² ≡ (-1 + mp) + 2akp mod p². So, x² ≡ -1 + (mp + 2akp) mod p². Therefore, to have x² ≡ -1 mod p², we need mp + 2akp ≡ 0 mod p². That is, p(m + 2ak) ≡ 0 mod p², which simplifies to m + 2ak ≡ 0 mod p. \n\nBut m is such that a² = -1 + mp. So, m = (a² + 1)/p. Since a² ≡ -1 mod p, (a² + 1)/p is an integer. Therefore, m is an integer. Therefore, the equation becomes (a² + 1)/p + 2ak ≡ 0 mod p. Multiply both sides by p: a² + 1 + 2akp ≡ 0 mod p². Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we have a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p. Let x = a mod p. Then, we can try to find x = a + kp such that x² ≡ -1 mod p². \n\nExpanding x²: (a + kp)^2 = a² + 2akp + k²p². Since a² ≡ -1 mod p, let a² = -1 + mp. Then, x² = (-1 + mp) + 2akp + k²p². Therefore, x² ≡ (-1 + mp) + 2akp mod p². We need this to be ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, mp + 2akp ≡ 0 mod p². Dividing both sides by p: m + 2ak ≡ 0 mod p. \n\nBut m is (a² + 1)/p, which is an integer. Therefore, m ≡ -2ak mod p. Therefore, k ≡ -m/(2a) mod p. Since a is a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p, and p is an odd prime (since 13 is odd), 2a is invertible mod p. Therefore, such a k exists. Therefore, we can lift the solution from mod p to mod p². \n\nTherefore, for primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, there exists a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, there exists n such that n² ≡ a mod p², where a² ≡ -1 mod p². Wait, but actually, x² ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, n⁴ ≡ (n²)^2 ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, if such an n exists, then p² divides n⁴ + 1. \n\nTherefore, for primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, there exists n such that p² divides n⁴ + 1. So, the first part's answer for p is the smallest prime ≡1 mod 4, which is 5. Wait, but we saw that p = 5 does not have a solution. Wait, this seems contradictory. \n\nWait, maybe my reasoning is flawed. Let me check again. If p ≡1 mod 4, then there exists a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p. Then, using Hensel's lemma, we can lift this solution to mod p². Therefore, there exists a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p², which would imply that n² ≡ a mod p² where a² ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Therefore, p² divides n⁴ + 1. \n\nBut in the case of p = 5, even though there is a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod 5, when we tried to compute n⁴ mod 25, we didn't find any n such that n⁴ ≡ 24 mod 25. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's take p = 5. Let's check n from 0 to 24:\n\nn=0: 0⁴ +1=1 mod25, no\nn=1:1+1=2 mod25, no\nn=2:16+1=17 mod25, no\nn=3:81+1=82 mod25=82-3*25=82-75=7 mod25, no\nn=4:256+1=257 mod25=257-10*25=257-250=7 mod25, no\nn=5:0+1=1 mod25, no\nn=6:1296+1=1297 mod25. 1297 divided by 25: 25*51=1275, 1297-1275=22 mod25, no\nn=7:7⁴=2401+1=2402 mod25. 2402-96*25=2402-2400=2 mod25, no\nn=8:8⁴=4096+1=4097 mod25. 4097-163*25=4097-4075=22 mod25, no\nn=9:9⁴=6561+1=6562 mod25. 6562-262*25=6562-6550=12 mod25, no\nn=10:0+1=1 mod25, no\nn=11:11⁴=14641+1=14642 mod25. 14642-585*25=14642-1462", "answer": "110"}

There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find these distances expressed in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, first of all, the point I is called the incenter of the tetrahedron. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, similar to how the incenter in a triangle is equidistant from all three sides. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius.\n\nSo, the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is similar to that of a triangle but extended to three dimensions. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the sum of the areas of all four faces.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.\n2. Calculate the areas of all four faces.\n3. Sum the areas to get S.\n4. Compute r = 3V / S.\n\nBut before jumping into calculations, let me check if the given tetrahedron is a \"disphenoid,\" which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. The problem states that AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. Yes, this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have certain properties that might simplify calculations.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent or in pairs. Wait, in this case, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe each pair of opposite faces are congruent. Let me verify.\n\nIn a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, so the faces can be divided into three pairs of congruent triangles. Let's check the edges:\n\nAB = CD = √41\n\nAC = BD = √80\n\nBC = AD = √89\n\nSo, the edges AB and CD are equal, AC and BD are equal, BC and AD are equal. Therefore, each pair of opposite edges is equal, which is the definition of a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, the faces are congruent in pairs. Wait, but does that mean each pair of opposite faces are congruent? Let me think.\n\nIn a disphenoid, there are three distinct pairs of opposite edges, and each pair of opposite faces shares a common edge. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a disphenoid, the four faces are all congruent. Wait, no. For example, a rhombic disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces, but that's a special case. In general, a disphenoid can have two pairs of congruent faces.\n\nWait, according to the definition, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, or one pair of congruent opposite edges, and the other two pairs of opposite edges equal. Wait, maybe I need to confirm.\n\nLooking it up in my mind... A disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces if it's a regular tetrahedron, but more generally, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in this problem, since all opposite edges are equal, it's a disphenoid. Therefore, in such a tetrahedron, the faces are congruent in pairs. Let's see.\n\nEach face is a triangle. Let's list the faces:\n\n- Face ABC: edges AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89\n- Face ABD: edges AB = √41, AD = √89, BD = √80\n- Face ACD: edges AC = √80, AD = √89, CD = √41\n- Face BCD: edges BC = √89, BD = √80, CD = √41\n\nWait, so each face is a triangle with edges √41, √80, √89. Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. Because each face has the same edge lengths. So, actually, it's a tetrahedron with all four faces congruent. That's called a isohedral tetrahedron. So, in this case, the tetrahedron is isohedral, which means that all faces are congruent, and the inradius can be calculated as 3V divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the sum S of the areas is 4 times the area of one face. So, first, I need to compute the area of one face.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle ABC. The edges are AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89. Let's use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2\n\nBut Heron's formula might get complicated here because of the square roots. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to recognize that triangle ABC is a right triangle? Let's check.\n\nCheck if (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 = (√89)^2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n41 + 80 = 121\n\n(√89)^2 = 89\n\n121 ≠ 89. So, not a right triangle. Hmm. Then perhaps using Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for area in terms of edges and the cosine law to find an angle, then compute area as (1/2)*ab*sinθ.\n\nAlternatively, since we have all three sides, maybe use Heron's formula numerically. But since the answer needs to be exact, perhaps there's a simplification.\n\nWait, maybe the triangle with sides √41, √80, √89 is part of a Pythagorean quadruple or something. Let me check.\n\nLet me square the sides:\n\n(√41)^2 = 41\n\n(√80)^2 = 80\n\n(√89)^2 = 89\n\nSo, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². Wait, 89 is a prime number. Hmm, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². But 89 is another prime. So, if I consider the triangle with sides √41, √80, √89, the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides is 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², which is greater than 89. Therefore, the triangle is acute. Not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the area using Heron's formula:\n\nArea = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]\n\nBut let's see:\n\ns = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Wait, let's consider coordinates. If we can assign coordinates to the vertices, then compute the volume and the areas. Since the tetrahedron is isohedral, maybe it's a regular tetrahedron, but with edge lengths not all equal. Wait, no, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but here they are in pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can place the tetrahedron in 3D coordinate space to compute coordinates of the vertices, then compute volume and areas.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates. Let me place vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Let me place vertex B along the x-axis, so B is at (x, 0, 0). Then, vertex C is somewhere in the xy-plane, and vertex D is somewhere in 3D space.\n\nGiven that AB = √41, so the distance from A to B is √41, so let's set B at (√41, 0, 0).\n\nNext, AC = √80. Let me place point C in the xy-plane. Let’s say point C is at (a, b, 0). Then, the distance AC is √(a² + b²) = √80, so a² + b² = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = √89. The distance between B (√41, 0, 0) and C (a, b, 0) is √[(a - √41)^2 + (b - 0)^2] = √89. Therefore:\n\n(a - √41)^2 + b² = 89\n\nBut we already have a² + b² = 80. Subtract the two equations:\n\n(a - √41)^2 + b² - (a² + b²) = 89 - 80 => (a² - 2a√41 + 41) - a² = 9 => -2a√41 + 41 = 9 => -2a√41 = -32 => 2a√41 = 32 => a√41 = 16 => a = 16 / √41\n\nBut a should be rational if coordinates are to be nice. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute a:\n\na = 16 / √41 = (16√41)/41\n\nSimilarly, from a² + b² = 80:\n\n(256 * 41)/ (41²) + b² = 80 => (256 / 41) + b² = 80 => b² = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41 => b = √(3024/41) = (√3024)/√41 = (√(16*189))/√41 = (4√189)/√41 = (4√(9*21))/√41 = (4*3√21)/√41 = (12√21)/√41 = (12√(21*41))/41\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the tetrahedron has all edges in pairs, maybe it's symmetric in some way. Let's try to use coordinates.\n\nLet me set vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (√41, 0, 0). Then, vertex C is (a, b, 0), and vertex D is (c, d, e). Let's use the given edge lengths.\n\nWe have:\n\nAC = √80: so √(a² + b²) = √80 → a² + b² = 80\n\nAD = √89: distance from A to D is √(c² + d² + e²) = √89 → c² + d² + e² = 89\n\nBC = √89: distance from B to C is √[(a - √41)^2 + b²] = √89 → (a - √41)^2 + b² = 89\n\nBD = √80: distance from B to D is √[(c - √41)^2 + d² + e²] = √80 → (c - √41)^2 + d² + e² = 80\n\nCD = √41: distance from C to D is √[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e²] = √41 → (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e² = 41\n\nAlso, face ABC is the base, and face ABD, ACD, BCD are the other faces.\n\nWe already used some equations:\n\nFrom AB and AC, we have:\n\nAB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89.\n\nSimilarly, BD = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use these equations to solve for coordinates.\n\nFrom BC = √89 and AB = √41, we had earlier:\n\n(a - √41)^2 + b² = 89\n\nBut a² + b² = 80. Subtract the two equations:\n\n(a - √41)^2 + b² - a² - b² = 89 - 80\n\nExpanding (a - √41)^2: a² - 2a√41 + 41\n\nSo, a² - 2a√41 + 41 - a² = 9\n\nThus, -2a√41 + 41 = 9 → -2a√41 = -32 → a = 16 / √41 = (16√41)/41\n\nSo, a = 16√41 / 41\n\nThen, from a² + b² = 80:\n\n(256 * 41)/(41²) + b² = 80 → (256 / 41) + b² = 80 → b² = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nTherefore, b = √(3024 / 41) = √(3024)/√41\n\nSimplify √3024:\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nTherefore, √3024 = 4 * 3 * √(21) = 12√21\n\nThus, b = 12√21 / √41 = (12√(21*41))/41\n\nSo, coordinates of C are (16√41/41, 12√21√41/41, 0)\n\nWait, but √(21*41) is √861, but maybe we can leave it as is", "answer": "104"}

So, we have a set B made up of 54 cubes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the square of the smallest radius r of a sphere that can fit inside each of these cubes. Then, express r² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand. Each cube in set B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because normally, the surface area and volume of a cube are related by the side length. Let me check.\n\nIf a cube has side length s, then its surface area is 6s² and its volume is s³. So, if we set up equations:\n\n6s² = 54 (surface area)\n\ns³ = 23 (volume)\n\nWait, that can't be possible. If 6s² = 54, then s² = 9, so s = 3. Then the volume would be 27, not 23. But the problem says the volume is 23. That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe the problem is not about a single cube, but about multiple cubes? Wait, the problem says \"taisnstrūrveida kastu kopes ar virsmas laukuma 54 un tilpuma 23\". Translating that, it's \"sets of cubes with surface area 54 and volume 23\". Wait, maybe each cube in the set B has surface area 54 and volume 23? But that's impossible because as we saw, s² = 9 and s³ = 27. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in another language, and maybe there was a mistranslation? Let me check again. The original problem is in Russian? The user wrote \"Lai B ir taisstinērveida kastu kopes...\", but maybe the original language is another. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correctly stated, but there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe \"taisnstrūrveida kastu kopes\" translates to \"sets of cubes with surface area and volume...\", but maybe each cube in set B has surface area 54 and volume 23? But as we saw, that's impossible. So, perhaps the problem is misstated. Alternatively, maybe the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23, but each cube in the set B? Wait, the problem says \"kastu kopes ar vispēm 54 un tilpums 23\"—so the cubes have surface areas 54 and volumes 23? But each cube can't have both. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about multiple cubes with surface areas and volumes such that the total surface area is 54 and the total volume is 23. But that would be a different problem. Wait, the problem says \"kastu kopes ar vispēm 54 un tilpums 23\", which could mean that all the cubes together have a total surface area of 54 and a total volume of 23. Then, set B is a collection of such cubes. So, each cube in B has some surface area and volume, and all together sum up to total surface area 54 and total volume 23. Then, we need to find the smallest radius r of a sphere that can fit inside each cube in B. Then, compute r² and express it as a fraction.\n\nBut if each cube in B has a total surface area of 54 and total volume of 23, then how many cubes are there? Wait, the problem says \"kastu kopes ar vispēm 54 un tilpums 23\", which would be total surface area 54 and total volume 23. Then, set B is a set of cubes with these totals. So, if all the cubes in B have the same surface area and volume, then we can find the number of cubes. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose there are n cubes in set B. Each cube has surface area S and volume V. Then total surface area is n*S = 54, total volume is n*V = 23. Then, S = 54/n and V = 23/n. But for a cube, S = 6s² and V = s³. Therefore, 6s² = 54/n and s³ = 23/n. Let's solve for s from the volume equation: s = (23/n)^(1/3). Then plug into the surface area equation: 6*( (23/n)^(1/3) )² = 54/n. Let's simplify:\n\n6 * (23/n)^(2/3) = 54/n\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n(23/n)^(2/3) = 9/n\n\nRaise both sides to the 3/2 power to eliminate the exponent:\n\n(23/n) = (9/n)^(3/2)\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me write it step by step.\n\nStarting from:\n\n6*(23/n)^(2/3) = 54/n\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n(23/n)^(2/3) = 9/n\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n(23/n) = (9/n)^(3/2)\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(23/n) = (9^(3/2)) / (n^(3/2))\n\nWhich is:\n\n23/n = 27 / n^(3/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by n^(3/2):\n\n23 * n^(1/2) = 27\n\nThen:\n\nn^(1/2) = 27 / 23\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nn = (27/23)^2 = 729 / 529\n\nBut n must be an integer because it's the number of cubes. 729/529 is approximately 1.377, which is not an integer. Therefore, this approach leads to a contradiction. So, perhaps the problem is not about multiple cubes with total surface area 54 and total volume 23, but each cube has surface area 54 and volume 23, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistranslation or misinterpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem says that each cube in set B has surface area 54 and volume 23? But that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe it's surface area 54 and volume 23 in total? Wait, the problem says \"kastu kopes ar vispēm 54 un tilpums 23\"—translating to \"sets of cubes with total surface area 54 and total volume 23\". So, the entire set has total surface area 54 and total volume 23. Then, each cube in the set B has some surface area and volume, but the total over all cubes is 54 and 23. Then, we need to find the smallest radius r such that a sphere of radius r can fit inside each cube in B. So, the minimal sphere radius would correspond to the minimal cube in B, because the sphere has to fit inside every cube. Therefore, to find the minimal r, we need to find the cube in B with the smallest possible side length, since the sphere must fit inside each cube. So, the sphere radius would be half the side length of the smallest cube.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal side length among all cubes in set B, given that the total surface area is 54 and total volume is 23, then compute r = min(s)/2, and then r².\n\nBut how to find the minimal side length? Let's think.\n\nLet’s denote that there are n cubes in set B, each with side length s_i (i = 1, 2, ..., n). Then total surface area is sum_{i=1}^n 6s_i² = 54, and total volume is sum_{i=1}^n s_i³ = 23. We need to find the minimal s_i, then compute r = s_min / 2, and then r².\n\nBut how to find s_min? Since the sum of the volumes is 23, and the sum of the surface areas is 54. To minimize the smallest s_i, we would need to maximize the other s_i as much as possible, so that the remaining volume is spread out over the remaining cubes, thus keeping the minimal s_i as small as possible.\n\nThis is similar to an optimization problem where you have to distribute the total volume and surface area across multiple cubes, trying to minimize the smallest cube. Hmm, this seems complex. Maybe we can use inequalities.\n\nLet’s suppose that there is one cube with side length s_min, and the rest n - 1 cubes have side length as large as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all cubes except one have the maximum possible side length, so that the remaining volume is minimal, forcing the minimal cube to be as small as possible.\n\nWait, but this is vague. Let's try to formalize it.\n\nLet’s denote s_min as the minimal side length, and the other cubes have side length s ≥ s_min. Then, total volume is s_min³ + (n - 1)s³ = 23, and total surface area is 6s_min² + 6(n - 1)s² = 54.\n\nWe need to solve for s_min and s, with s ≥ s_min, and n being an integer ≥ 1.\n\nBut we have two equations and three variables (s_min, s, n). So, this seems underdetermined. Alternatively, maybe n is given? Wait, the problem says \"kastu kopes ar vispēm 54 un tilpums 23\", which is 54 and 23. The problem statement doesn't mention the number of cubes, so n is part of the variables here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution for n? Let's see.\n\nAssuming that n is an integer, and s and s_min are positive real numbers with s ≥ s_min.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of n.\n\nFrom the surface area equation:\n\n6s_min² + 6(n - 1)s² = 54 => s_min² + (n - 1)s² = 9.\n\nFrom the volume equation:\n\ns_min³ + (n - 1)s³ = 23.\n\nWe need to find s_min, s, and integer n such that these equations hold with s ≥ s_min.\n\nLet’s try small values of n.\n\nStart with n = 1: Then, the only cube has s_min = cube root(23) ≈ 2.84, and surface area 6*(2.84)^2 ≈ 6*8.06 ≈ 48.36, which is less than 54. So, not possible.\n\nn = 2:\n\nEquations:\n\ns_min² + s² = 9\n\ns_min³ + s³ = 23\n\nWe need to solve these equations for s_min and s, with s ≥ s_min.\n\nLet’s denote s_min = a, s = b, so:\n\na² + b² = 9\n\na³ + b³ = 23\n\nWe can use the identity a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)\n\nFrom the first equation, a² + b² = 9. Then, a³ + b³ = (a + b)(9 - ab) = 23.\n\nLet’s let s = a + b, p = ab. Then:\n\na³ + b³ = s(9 - p) = 23\n\nAlso, from a² + b² = 9, we have (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² = 9 + 2p = s². Therefore, p = (s² - 9)/2.\n\nSubstitute into the equation s(9 - p) = 23:\n\ns(9 - (s² - 9)/2) = 23\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n9 - (s² - 9)/2 = (18 - s² + 9)/2 = (27 - s²)/2\n\nTherefore:\n\ns*(27 - s²)/2 = 23\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ns(27 - s²) = 46\n\nSo:\n\n27s - s³ = 46\n\nRearranged:\n\ns³ - 27s + 46 = 0\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation. Let's try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.\n\nTest s=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0\n\ns=2: 8 -54 +46=0. 8-54= -46 +46=0. Yes! s=2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor:\n\n(s - 2)(s² + 2s -23) = 0\n\nSo, roots are s=2, and s=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2√6.\n\nSince s must be positive, the only positive roots are s=2 and s= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899.\n\nSo, possible solutions are s=2 and s≈3.899.\n\nFirst, s=2:\n\nThen, from s = a + b = 2, and p = ab = (s² -9)/2 = (4 -9)/2 = -5/2.\n\nSo, ab = -5/2. But a and b are positive real numbers (side lengths), so their product can't be negative. Therefore, this solution is invalid.\n\nNext, s= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.899:\n\nThen, p = ab = (s² -9)/2 ≈ ((3.899)^2 -9)/2 ≈ (15.199 -9)/2 ≈6.199/2≈3.0995.\n\nSo, ab≈3.0995.\n\nWe have a + b ≈3.899 and ab≈3.0995.\n\nThen, solving for a and b:\n\nThe quadratic equation x² - sx + p =0 => x² - ( -1 + 2√6 )x + (-1 + 2√6)^2 /2 =0? Wait, no. Wait, s is a + b, p is ab. So, the quadratic equation", "answer": "721"}

Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot \\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x} = 10\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{x \\ln y}{\\ln x} = 10 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the second equation: \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\).\n\nSimilarly, applying the power rule:\n\\[\n4y \\log_y(x) = 10\n\\]\nUsing the change of base formula \\( \\log_y(x) = \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln y} \\), we substitute:\n\\[\n4y \\cdot \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln y} = 10\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{4y \\ln x}{\\ln y} = 10 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations (1) and (2):\n1. \\( \\frac{x \\ln y}{\\ln x} = 10 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{4y \\ln x}{\\ln y} = 10 \\)\n\nTo solve these, let's introduce variables for simplification. Let \\( a = \\ln x \\) and \\( b = \\ln y \\). Then \\( x = e^a \\) and \\( y = e^b \\). Substituting these into the equations:\n\nEquation (1) becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{e^a \\cdot b}{a} = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{b e^a}{a} = 10 \\quad \\text{(1')}\n\\]\n\nEquation (2) becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 e^b \\cdot a}{b} = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{4 a e^b}{b} = 10 \\quad \\text{(2')}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's denote equation (1') and (2'):\n\n(1') \\( \\frac{b e^a}{a} = 10 \\)\n\n(2') \\( \\frac{4 a e^b}{b} = 10 \\)\n\nLet me divide equation (1') by equation (2') to eliminate some variables. Taking (1') / (2'):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{b e^a}{a}}{\\frac{4 a e^b}{b}} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b e^a}{a} \\cdot \\frac{b}{4 a e^b} = \\frac{b^2 e^{a - b}}{4 a^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2 e^{a - b}}{4 a^2} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 e^{a - b} = 4 a^2 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider equations (1') and (2') again. Let me write them as:\n\nFrom (1'):\n\n\\( b e^a = 10 a \\quad \\text{(1'')}\\)\n\nFrom (2'):\n\n\\( 4 a e^b = 10 b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 a e^b = 5 b \\quad \\text{(2'')}\\)\n\nSo, from (1''): \\( b e^a = 10 a \\)\n\nFrom (2''): \\( 2 a e^b = 5 b \\)\n\nLet me express \\( e^a \\) and \\( e^b \\) from these equations.\n\nFrom (1''):\n\n\\( e^a = \\frac{10 a}{b} \\quad \\text{(4)}\\)\n\nFrom (2''):\n\n\\( e^b = \\frac{5 b}{2 a} \\quad \\text{(5)}\\)\n\nNow, substitute (4) and (5) into equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) is \\( b^2 e^{a - b} = 4 a^2 \\)\n\nExpress \\( e^{a - b} = e^a / e^b \\). Using (4) and (5):\n\n\\( e^a = \\frac{10 a}{b} \\), \\( e^b = \\frac{5 b}{2 a} \\), so:\n\n\\( e^{a - b} = \\frac{10 a / b}{5 b / (2 a)} = \\frac{10 a / b \\times 2 a}{5 b} = \\frac{20 a^2}{5 b^2} = \\frac{4 a^2}{b^2} \\)\n\nTherefore, substituting into equation (3):\n\n\\( b^2 \\times \\frac{4 a^2}{b^2} = 4 a^2 \\)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n\\( 4 a^2 = 4 a^2 \\)\n\nWhich is an identity, meaning that equation (3) is dependent on equations (1'') and (2''). So, we can't get more information from here. We need another approach.\n\nPerhaps we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\) or vice versa.\n\nFrom (1''): \\( b e^a = 10 a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad e^a = \\frac{10 a}{b} \\)\n\nFrom (2''): \\( 2 a e^b = 5 b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad e^b = \\frac{5 b}{2 a} \\)\n\nLet me take the ratio of \\( e^a / e^b \\):\n\n\\( e^{a - b} = \\frac{e^a}{e^b} = \\frac{10 a / b}{5 b / (2 a)} = \\frac{10 a / b \\times 2 a}{5 b} = \\frac{20 a^2}{5 b^2} = \\frac{4 a^2}{b^2} \\)\n\nWhich is consistent with earlier substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me take natural logarithm of both sides of equations (4) and (5):\n\nFrom (4): \\( \\ln e^a = \\ln \\left( \\frac{10 a}{b} \\right) \\Rightarrow a = \\ln(10 a) - \\ln b \\quad \\text{(6)} \\)\n\nFrom (5): \\( \\ln e^b = \\ln \\left( \\frac{5 b}{2 a} \\right) \\Rightarrow b = \\ln(5 b) - \\ln(2 a) \\quad \\text{(7)} \\)\n\nNow, equations (6) and (7):\n\n(6): \\( a = \\ln(10 a) - \\ln b \\)\n\n(7): \\( b = \\ln(5 b) - \\ln(2 a) \\)\n\nThis system seems complicated, but maybe we can find a substitution.\n\nLet me denote \\( u = \\ln a \\) and \\( v = \\ln b \\). Then \\( a = e^u \\), \\( b = e^v \\).\n\nSubstituting into equation (6):\n\n\\( e^u = \\ln(10 e^u) - \\ln(e^v) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( e^u = \\ln 10 + u - v \\quad \\text{(6')} \\)\n\nSimilarly, equation (7):\n\n\\( e^v = \\ln 5 + v - \\ln(2 e^u) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( e^v = \\ln 5 + v - (\\ln 2 + u) \\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\( e^v = \\ln 5 - \\ln 2 + v - u \\quad \\text{(7')} \\)\n\nSo now, equations (6') and (7'):\n\n(6'): \\( e^u = \\ln 10 + u - v \\)\n\n(7'): \\( e^v = \\ln(5/2) + v - u \\)\n\nNote that \\( \\ln(5/2) = \\ln 5 - \\ln 2 \\).\n\nLet me denote equation (6') as:\n\n\\( e^u - u + v = \\ln 10 \\quad \\text{(8)} \\)\n\nAnd equation (7') as:\n\n\\( e^v + u - v = \\ln(5/2) \\quad \\text{(9)} \\)\n\nNow, let me denote equations (8) and (9):\n\n(8): \\( e^u - u + v = \\ln 10 \\)\n\n(9): \\( e^v + u - v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( S = u + v \\) and \\( D = u - v \\). Maybe expressing in terms of S and D could help.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFrom (8):\n\n\\( e^u - u + v = \\ln 10 \\)\n\nLet me write \\( v = S - u \\), then:\n\n\\( e^u - u + (S - u) = \\ln 10 \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( e^u - 2u + S = \\ln 10 \\quad \\text{(10)} \\)\n\nFrom (9):\n\n\\( e^v + u - v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( u = S - v \\), so:\n\n\\( e^v + (S - v) - v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( e^v + S - 2v = \\ln(5/2) \\quad \\text{(11)} \\)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(10): \\( e^u - 2u + S = \\ln 10 \\)\n\n(11): \\( e^v + S - 2v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nLet me subtract (11) from (10):\n\n\\( e^u - 2u - e^v - S + 2v = \\ln 10 - \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider adding equations (10) and (11):\n\n\\( e^u - 2u + S + e^v + S - 2v = \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( e^u + e^v - 2u - 2v + 2S = \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nBut \\( S = u + v \\), so:\n\n\\( e^u + e^v - 2(u + v) + 2(u + v) = \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( e^u + e^v = \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nBut \\( \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) = \\ln(10 \\times 5/2) = \\ln(25) \\). So:\n\n\\( e^u + e^v = \\ln 25 \\quad \\text{(12)} \\)\n\nThis is an interesting equation, but not sure how to proceed. Let me see if we can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations (8) and (9) again. Suppose we set \\( u = v \\). Let's test this.\n\nIf \\( u = v \\), then from (8):\n\n\\( e^u - u + u = \\ln 10 \\Rightarrow e^u = \\ln 10 \\Rightarrow u = \\ln(\\ln 10) \\)\n\nSimilarly, from (9):\n\n\\( e^u + u - u = \\ln(5/2) \\Rightarrow e^u = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nBut \\( \\ln(\\ln 10) \\) is not equal to \\( \\ln(5/2) \\). Therefore, \\( u \\neq v \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( u = -v \\). Let's check.\n\nIf \\( u = -v \\), then from (8):\n\n\\( e^{-v} - (-v) + v = \\ln 10 \\Rightarrow e^{-v} + 2v = \\ln 10 \\)\n\nFrom (9):\n\n\\( e^{v} + (-v) - v = \\ln(5/2) \\Rightarrow e^{v} - 2v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. \\( e^{-v} + 2v = \\ln 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( e^{v} - 2v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nLet me denote equation (13): \\( e^{-v} + 2v = \\ln 10 \\)\n\nEquation (14): \\( e^{v} - 2v = \\ln(5/2) \\)\n\nLet me add equations (13) and (14):\n\n\\( e^{-v} + e^{v} = \\ln 10 + \\ln(5/2) = \\ln(10 \\times 5/2) = \\ln 25 \\)\n\nSo \\( e^v + e^{-v} = \\ln 25 \\)\n\nBut \\( e^v + e^{-v} = 2 \\cosh v \\), so:\n\n\\( 2 \\cosh v = \\ln 25 \\Rightarrow \\cosh v = \\frac{\\ln 25}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( v = \\cosh^{-1}\\left( \\frac{\\ln 25}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nBut this might not lead to a closed-form solution. Let me compute numerically.\n\nFirst, note that \\( \\ln 25 \\approx 3.2189 \\), so \\( \\ln 25 / 2 \\approx 1.6094 \\). The inverse hyperbolic cosine of 1.6094 is:\n\n\\( \\cosh^{-1}(1.6094) = \\ln(1.6094 + \\sqrt{1.6094^2 - 1}) \\)\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\( 1.6094^2 \\approx 2.590 \\)\n\nSo \\( \\sqrt{2.590 - 1} = \\sqrt{1.59", "answer": "25"}

The game starts with \\( n \\) coins, and each player, starting with Alice, can remove either 1 or 4 coins on their turn. The player who cannot move (i.e., when there are no coins left) loses, which means the player who takes the last coin wins. Bob wants to ensure that no matter how Alice plays, he will be the one to take the last coin.\n\nThis type of game is a classic example of a combinatorial game theory problem, often solved using the concept of \"winning\" and \"losing\" positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nLet's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - If there are 0 coins left, the current player loses (the opponent wins).\n   - If there are 1 or 4 coins left, the current player can take all coins and win.\n   - If there are 2 coins left, the current player can take 1 coin, leaving 1 coin for the opponent, who then takes the last one and wins. Therefore, 2 is a losing position.\n   - If there are 3 coins left, the current player can take 1 coin, leaving 2 coins for the opponent, who is then in a losing position. Therefore, 3 is a winning position.\n   - If there are 5 coins left, the current player can take 1 coin, leaving 4 coins for the opponent, who can then take all 4 and win. Alternatively, taking 4 coins leaves 1 coin for the opponent to take and win. Therefore, 5 is a losing position.\n   - If there are 6 coins left, the current player can take 1 coin, leaving 5 coins for the opponent, which is a losing position. Therefore, 6 is a winning position.\n   - If there are 7 coins left, the current player can take 4 coins, leaving 3 coins for the opponent, who can then take 1 and leave 2 coins for the current player, who is then in a losing position. Therefore, 7 is a winning position. Alternatively, taking 1 coin leaves 6 coins, which is a winning position for the opponent. But since the player can choose the optimal move, they will take 4 to leave 3, a winning position for them. Wait, no. Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to formalize this. Let's define a position as losing if all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nLet's build the positions step by step:\n\n- Position 0: losing (can't move)\n- Position 1: winning (take 1)\n- Position 2: losing (only move to 1, which is winning)\n- Position 3: winning (take 1 to 2, which is losing)\n- Position 4: winning (take 4)\n- Position 5: losing (moves to 4 or 1, both are winning)\n- Position 6: winning (take 1 to 5, which is losing)\n- Position 7: winning (take 4 to 3, which is losing)\n- Position 8: losing (moves to 7 or 4, both are winning)\n- Position 9: winning (take 1 to 8, which is losing)\n- Position 10: winning (take 4 to 6, which is losing)\n- Position 11: winning (take 1 to 10, which is losing)\n- Position 12: losing (moves to 11 or 8, both are winning)\n- Position 13: winning (take 4 to 9, which is losing)\n- Position 14: winning (take 1 to 13, which is losing)\n- Position 15: winning (take 4 to 11, which is losing)\n- Position 16: losing (moves to 15 or 12, both are winning)\n- And so on.\n\nObserving the pattern, it seems that positions 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ... are losing positions. These are numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 (i.e., 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...). Wait, 2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod 3 is 2, etc. So the losing positions are numbers of the form 3k + 2.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- 3k + 2 = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ...\n- For position 2: moves to 1 (winning) or -2 (invalid). So only move to 1, which is a winning position, so 2 is losing.\n- For position 5: moves to 4 (winning) or 1 (winning). So 5 is losing.\n- For position 8: moves to 7 (winning) or 4 (winning). So 8 is losing.\n- Similarly, each subsequent losing position is 3 more than the previous one.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are those where \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\). This means that if the number of coins is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the current player is in a losing position if both players play optimally.\n\nHowever, in the problem, Alice starts first. So Bob wants to ensure that no matter what Alice does, he can force the game into a losing position for Alice. Therefore, Bob needs to be able to always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that he can force the number of coins to stay in the losing positions.\n\nBut wait, since Alice starts first, Bob needs to be able to counter her moves such that after each of Bob's turns, the number of coins is in a losing position. Therefore, the key is that Bob can always move to a losing position after Alice's move.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nIf \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), then Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, if the number of coins is a losing position, then the current player cannot win. So if Alice is in a losing position (i.e., \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\)), then Bob can win. But wait, in our analysis, losing positions are 2, 5, 8, etc. So if Alice starts at a losing position, she cannot win, so Bob can win. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that Bob wants to guarantee that he will win regardless of Alice's moves. So if the initial number of coins is a losing position, then no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. Therefore, the values of \\( n \\) where Bob can guarantee a win are those congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nBut wait, let's check with the initial positions:\n\n- If Alice starts with \\( n = 2 \\), which is a losing position. Then whatever she does (takes 1 or 4), Bob can take the remaining coins:\n\n  - If Alice takes 1, 2 - 1 = 1 coin left. Bob takes 1 and wins.\n  \n  - If Alice takes 4, but there are only 2 coins, so she can't. So Bob wins.\n\n- If Alice starts with \\( n = 5 \\), which is a losing position. She can take 1 or 4:\n\n  - If she takes 1, 5 - 1 = 4. Bob takes 4 and wins.\n  \n  - If she takes 4, 5 - 4 = 1. Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\n- Similarly, \\( n = 8 \\):\n\n  - If Alice takes 1, 8 - 1 = 7. Bob takes 4, leaving 3. Alice takes 1, leaving 2. Bob takes 2 and wins.\n  \n  Wait, but 7 is a winning position. Wait, no. Wait, 7 is a winning position because from 7, you can take 4 to leave 3, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe my earlier conclusion is incorrect. Let's re-examine.\n\nIf we consider positions:\n\n- If \\( n = 2 \\): losing\n- \\( n = 3 \\): winning\n- \\( n = 4 \\): winning\n- \\( n = 5 \\): losing\n- \\( n = 6 \\): winning\n- \\( n = 7 \\): winning\n- \\( n = 8 \\): losing\n- etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ..., i.e., \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\nTherefore, if the starting position is a losing position (\\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\)), then Alice cannot force a win, and Bob can. Therefore, Bob's winning strategy is to always move to a losing position.\n\nBut how does Bob do that? Let's see:\n\nSuppose Alice starts at \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\). Then, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can respond to bring the total back to a losing position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If Alice takes 1 coin from \\( n = 5 \\), then there are 4 coins left. Bob can take 4 coins and win.\n\nWait, but 4 is a winning position. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 5, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob? No, 4 is a winning position because Bob can take all 4 and win. Wait, but 4 is a winning position because the player can take all 4 coins to win. So if Alice leaves 4 coins, Bob can take them and win. Similarly, if Alice takes 4 from 5, leaving 1 coin, Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nSo in both cases, Bob can win. Therefore, if Alice starts at a losing position (n ≡ 2 mod 3), Bob can win.\n\nSimilarly, if Alice starts at a winning position (n not ≡ 2 mod 3), then Bob can move to a losing position.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nSuppose n = 3 (winning position). Alice can take 1, leaving 2 (losing position). Then Bob is in a losing position. So Bob cannot win. Therefore, Bob loses.\n\nSimilarly, n = 4 (winning). Alice can take 1, leaving 3 (winning), or take 4 and win. If Alice takes 1, leaving 3, which is a winning position for Bob. Bob can take 1, leaving 2 (losing), and then Alice is in a losing position. Wait, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win; otherwise, Alice can win. But according to the problem statement, Bob wants to guarantee that he will win regardless of Alice's moves. Therefore, the values of n where Bob can always win are those where n ≡ 2 mod 3.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, Bob starts second. Wait, the problem says: \"Alise un Bobs spēlē šādu spēli.

During the lottery draw, 4 numbers are also randomly selected from the same set S.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"liimē galveno balvu, ja visi četri viňas izvēlētie skaitļi ir nejauši izvēlētie skaitverts.\" So \"visi četri\" is \"all three,\" and \"nejauši izvēlētie skaitverts\" is \"the drawn numbers.\" So the major prize is winning if all three of her selected numbers are among the four drawn numbers.

That's interesting because she could have selected four numbers, but even if three of them are among the four drawn, she gets the major prize. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the minor prize requires at least two of her numbers to be in the drawn numbers. The major prize requires all three of her numbers to be in the drawn numbers. So even though she has four numbers on her ticket, the prizes depend on how many of her numbers are in the four drawn numbers.\n\nSo the question is asking for the probability that she wins the major prize, given that she already won the minor prize. This is a conditional probability: P(major | minor). The answer is supposed to be m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we need to find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's recall that conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she has won the major prize, then she automatically has at least two of her numbers in the drawn numbers (since three are in the drawn numbers, which is more than two). Therefore, A ∩ B is just A (the event of winning the major prize). Therefore, P(major | minor) = P(major) / P(minor).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. If winning the major prize implies that she has at least two numbers in the drawn numbers, then indeed, the intersection of major and minor prizes is just the major prize. So the conditional probability is just the probability of the major prize divided by the probability of the minor prize.\n\nSo first, let's compute the total number of possible lottery draws. Since the numbers are drawn without replacement, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.\n\nNow, the minor prize is winning if at least two of her numbers are in the drawn numbers. So the number of favorable outcomes for minor prize is the number of ways the drawn 4 numbers can have 2, 3, or 4 overlaps with her 4 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the major prize is winning if all three of her numbers are in the drawn numbers. So the number of favorable outcomes for the major prize is the number of ways the drawn 4 numbers can have exactly 3 overlaps with her 4 numbers.\n\nWait, but hold on. She selected 4 numbers. The drawn numbers are 4 numbers. The overlap between her numbers and the drawn numbers can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But to win the minor prize, the overlap must be at least 2. To win the major prize, the overlap must be exactly 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to have exactly k overlaps is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k), where k is the number of overlapping numbers. Wait, let me check. She has 4 numbers, and the drawn numbers have 4 numbers. The number of ways where exactly k of her numbers are in the drawn numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because she needs to choose k numbers from her 4, and the remaining 4 - k numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't choose.\n\nSo for the minor prize, k ≥ 2. So the number of favorable outcomes is sum_{k=2}^4 [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)]. For the major prize, k = 3. So the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).\n\nLet me compute these values.\n\nFirst, total number of possible draws: C(10,4) = 210.\n\nFor the major prize (k = 3):\n\nC(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nSo the probability of the major prize is 24 / 210 = 24/210 = 4/35 ≈ 0.114.\n\nFor the minor prize (k = 2, 3, 4):\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFor k = 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nFor k = 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nFor k = 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo total favorable outcomes for minor prize: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nTherefore, probability of minor prize is 115 / 210 = 23/42 ≈ 0.5476.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability P(major | minor) = (4/35) / (23/42) = (4/35) * (42/23) = (4*42)/(35*23) = (168)/(805). Let's simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7: 168 ÷ 7 = 24; 805 ÷ 7 = 115. So 24/115. Check if 24 and 115 have any common divisors. 24 factors: 2, 3; 115 factors: 5, 23. No common factors. So 24/115 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, m = 24, n = 115, so m + n = 139.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal number of draws: C(10,4) = 210. Correct.\n\nMajor prize: k = 3. So choosing 3 from her 4, and 1 from the remaining 6. C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24. So 24/210 = 4/35. Correct.\n\nMinor prize: k=2,3,4. For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2). C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. 6*15=90. For k=3: 4*6=24. For k=4: 1*1=1. Total minor prize: 90+24+1=115. 115/210 reduces to 23/42. Correct.\n\nThen conditional probability: (4/35)/(23/42) = (4/35)*(42/23) = (4*42)/(35*23) = (168)/(805). Divide numerator and denominator by 7: 168 ÷7=24, 805 ÷7=115. So 24/115. Yes, 24 and 115 are coprime. 115=5*23, 24=2^3*3. No common factors. So m + n =24 +115=139.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 139. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let's confirm the problem statement again.\n\n\"Limē galveno balvu, ja visi četri viňas izvēlētie skaitļi ir nejauši izvēlētie skaitverts.\"\n\nSo \"visi četri\" is \"all three,\" and \"nejauši izvēlētie skaitverts\" is \"the drawn numbers.\" So the major prize is when all three of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers. Wait, but she chose four numbers. So if three of her numbers are in the four drawn numbers, does that count for the major prize? The problem says \"visi četri viňas izvēlētie skait cushion ir nejauši izvēlētie skaitverts,\" which is \"all three of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers.\" So even though she chose four numbers, the major prize is only awarded if all three of her numbers are in the drawn four. So the overlap is exactly three. So the number of favorable outcomes for major prize is the number of ways where exactly three of her numbers are in the drawn numbers. Which is C(4,3)*C(6,1)=24. So that part seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, minor prize is at least two. So the overlap is two, three, or four. So that's why we added those three cases. So the minor prize is when the overlap is two or more. So the conditional probability is 24 divided by the number of cases where overlap is two or more, which is 115. So 24/115. So the answer is 139.\n\nYes, seems correct. Let me check the arithmetic once more.\n\n24/35 divided by 23/42 is (24/35)*(42/23). 24*42 = 1008. 35*23=805. Then 1008/805. Divide numerator and denominator by 7: 1008 ÷7=144, 805 ÷7=115. So 144/115. Wait, wait, this contradicts my previous step. Wait, hold on. Wait, 24/35 divided by 23/42 is 24/35 * 42/23. Let me compute that again.\n\n24/35 * 42/23. 24 and 23 are coprime. 42 and 35 have a common factor of 7. So 42 ÷7=6, 35 ÷7=5. So it becomes (24/5) * (6/23) = (24*6)/(5*23) = 144/115. Wait, so 144/115 is the result. But earlier I had 24/115. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 24/35 divided by 23/42 is (24/35) * (42/23). 24*42 = 1008. 35*23=805. So 1008/805. Then simplifying, divide numerator and denominator by 7: 1008 ÷7=144, 805 ÷7=115. So 144/115. Therefore, 144/115 is the reduced fraction. But earlier, I thought it was 24/115. So which is correct?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me recast it.\n\nOriginal fractions: (4/35) / (23/42) = (4/35) * (42/23). Now, 4 and 23 are coprime. 42 and 35 have a common factor of 7. So 42 ÷7=6, 35 ÷7=5. Therefore, (4/5) * (6/23) = (4*6)/(5*23) = 24/115. Wait, but that's different from my previous step when I thought 24*42 /35*23=144/115. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, (4/35)*(42/23) is (4*42)/(35*23). Then 42/35 reduces to 6/5. So (4*6)/(5*23)=24/115. So that's correct. Earlier, when I thought of 144/115, that was a miscalculation. So 4*42=168, 35*23=805. 168/805. 168 divided by 7 is 24, 805 divided by 7 is 115. So 24/115. So yes, correct. Therefore, 24/115 is the correct reduced fraction. So m=24, n=115, m + n=139. So the answer is 139. Therefore, the previous calculation is correct.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the initial alternative calculation where I thought of", "answer": "116"}

So, we have two squares, ABCD and EFGH, which are inscribed in the same circle. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, and the points A, D, H, G are also on the same circle. We are given the lengths of BC, AB, FG, and EF, and we need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. Both squares are inscribed in the same circle, so their diagonals must be equal to the diameter of the circle. Since they are squares, the diagonal of each square is equal to the diameter. Therefore, the radius of the circle is half the diagonal of each square.\n\nLet me note down the given lengths:\n\n- BC = 16 (so side length of square ABCD is 16)\n- AB = 107 (another side, but since ABCD is a square, AB should be equal to BC. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, maybe ABCD is a square, so all sides are equal. But BC is given as 16, so AB should also be 16? Wait, maybe the problem says BC=16 and AB=107? Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Ja BC=16, AB=107, FG=17 un EF=184, kāds ir CE garums?\"\n\nSo, BC=16, AB=107. But in square ABCD, AB and BC are adjacent sides. If it's a square, then all sides should be equal. So BC=16 and AB=107? That can't be. There must be a translation issue. Wait, maybe the original problem is in another language, and \"Ja\" is like \"Given that...\" So maybe the problem is stating multiple given lengths, but perhaps in the original language, the labels are different.\n\nWait, perhaps ABCD and EFGH are squares, but the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are 107, 16, 107, 107? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is in the way it's written. Let me parse it again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Taisstināri ABCD un EFGH ir uzzīmēti tā, ka D,E,C,F ir kolineāri. Tāpmalu A,D,H,G ir uz viena apzlība. Ja BC=16, AB=107, FG=17 un EF=184, kāds ir CE garums?\"\n\nWait, \"uz viena apzlība\" – maybe \"uz viena aps�a\"? So, both squares are inscribed in the same circle. Then, D, E, C, F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are on the same circle. Given that BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184, find CE.\n\nWait, so ABCD is a square with side BC=16, so the sides would be AB=16, BC=16, etc. But the problem says AB=107. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a mislabeling. Alternatively, maybe ABCD is not a square? Wait, no, the problem says \"taisstināri ABCD un EFGH ir uzzīmēti tā\", which translates to \"squares ABCD and EFGH are inscribed in the same circle\". So ABCD and EFGH are both squares.\n\nTherefore, ABCD is a square with side BC=16, so all sides are 16. But the problem also states AB=107. That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistranslation. Alternatively, maybe the side AB is 107, but BC is 16? But in a square, adjacent sides are equal. So unless the square is labeled differently. Maybe the order of the letters is different? For example, ABCD is a square with sides AB=107, BC=16, but that's impossible. Wait, perhaps it's a rectangle? But the problem says squares. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not in English originally, but the user translated it. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal: \"Taisstināri ABCD un EFGH ir uzzīmēti tā, ka D,E,C,F ir kolineāri. Tāpmalu A,D,H,G ir uz viena apzlība. Ja BC=16, AB=107, FG=17 un EF=184, kāds ir CE garums?\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Taisstināri ABCD un EFGH ir uzzīmēti tā: Both squares ABCD and EFGH are inscribed in the same circle.\n\n- ka D,E,C,F ir kolineāri: Points D, E, C, F are collinear.\n\n- Tāpmalu A,D,H,G ir uz viena apzlība: Points A, D, H, G are on the same circle.\n\nWait, but if ABCD and EFGH are both inscribed in the same circle, then all their vertices are on that circle. But then, the points A, D, H, G being on the same circle is redundant because if the squares are inscribed in the same circle, all their vertices are on that circle. So maybe \"uz viena apzlība\" is a mistranslation. Perhaps \"on the same circle\"? But if they are already inscribed in the same circle, then all their points are on that circle.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is saying that both squares are inscribed in the same circle, and additionally, points A, D, H, G lie on a different circle? But that seems odd. Maybe the original problem had some other wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Tāpmalu A,D,H,G ir uz viena apzlība\" means that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle different from the one containing the squares. Wait, but the squares are already inscribed in a circle. So unless they are inscribed in a different circle, but the problem says \"uz viena apzlība\", which might mean the same circle. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to proceed.\n\nAssuming that ABCD and EFGH are both squares inscribed in the same circle. Therefore, their diagonals are equal to the diameter of the circle. Let's denote the radius of the circle as R. Then, the diagonal of each square is 2R.\n\nFor square ABCD, if BC=16, then the side length is 16, so the diagonal is 16√2, hence the radius R = (16√2)/2 = 8√2.\n\nBut the problem states AB=107. If AB is a side of the square, then AB should be equal to BC=16, but here it's given as 107. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, maybe ABCD is not a square? But the problem says \"squares ABCD\" and \"EFGH\". So both are squares. Therefore, this is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the squares are positioned. Maybe ABCD is a square, and EFGH is another square, both inscribed in the same circle, but with some overlapping points?\n\nWait, given that D, E, C, F are collinear, so points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Similarly, A, D, H, G are on the same circle. Wait, maybe A, D, H, G are also on the original circle where the squares are inscribed? If so, then all points of both squares lie on that circle, which is consistent with being inscribed.\n\nBut then, BC=16, AB=107. If ABCD is a square with BC=16, then AB should be 16. But the problem says AB=107. This is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps there's a mislabeling in the problem. Maybe AB is not a side of square ABCD? Wait, no, ABCD is a square, so AB is a side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. The original problem might have said that BC=16, FG=17, EF=184, and AB=107 is part of the problem. Wait, perhaps AB is not a side of square ABCD, but of another figure? Wait, no, the problem says \"ja BC=16, AB=107\", so BC and AB are sides of square ABCD. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's either a mistranslation or a typo in the problem. However, given that the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps we need to reinterpret the labels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ABCD is a square with BC=16, and EFGH is another square with FG=17, and EF=184. Wait, EF=184? But EFGH is a square, so EF should be a side, so FG=17, EF=184? That also doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps EF is a diagonal? If EF=184 is the diagonal of square EFGH, then the side length would be 184/√2. But the problem says FG=17. If FG is a side, then FG=17, so the diagonal is 17√2. But EF=184 is given. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look past the labels and focus on the relationships.\n\nSince both squares are inscribed in the same circle, their diagonals are equal to the diameter. Let's denote the radius of the circle as R, so the diameter is 2R. Therefore, the diagonal of each square is 2R.\n\nFor square ABCD, if BC=16, then the side length is 16, so the diagonal is 16√2, hence 2R = 16√2, so R = 8√2. Therefore, the radius is 8√2.\n\nBut then, square EFGH has FG=17. If FG is the side length, then the diagonal is 17√2, so the radius would be (17√2)/2 ≈ 12.0. But since both squares are inscribed in the same circle, their radii must be equal. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless 8√2 = (17√2)/2, which is not true. Therefore, something is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe FG is the diagonal of square EFGH? If FG=17 is the diagonal, then the side length is 17/√2, and the radius is half the diagonal, which is 17/√2 /2 = 17/(2√2). But since the radius must be the same as the other square, which is 8√2, this would require 8√2 = 17/(2√2), which implies 16*2 = 17, which is 32=17, which is false. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there must be a different interpretation. Maybe the labels are not of the sides but of the diagonals? Wait, the problem states BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. These are all side lengths or diagonals?\n\nWait, in a square, the diagonal is side*√2. So if BC=16 is a side, then diagonal is 16√2. If FG=17 is a side, then diagonal is 17√2. But since both squares are inscribed in the same circle, their diagonals must be equal. Therefore, 16√2 = 17√2, which is impossible. Therefore, BC and FG cannot both be sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BC and FG are diagonals. If BC=16 is the diagonal of square ABCD, then the side is 16/√2 = 8√2. Then the radius of the circle is half the diagonal, which is 8√2. Similarly, if FG=17 is the diagonal of square EFGH, then the side is 17/√2, and the radius would be 17/(2√2). But these radii must be equal, so 8√2 = 17/(2√2) => 16*2 =17 => 32=17, which is false. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BC and EF are sides, and FG and AB are diagonals? Wait, the problem says BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. So BC and AB are sides, FG and EF are sides? But in square ABCD, BC is a side, so AB should also be a side. Therefore, AB=107 would mean that the side length is 107, conflicting with BC=16. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about two separate squares, but about two overlapping squares inscribed in the same circle? But the problem says \"squares ABCD un EFGH ir uzzīmēti tā\", which translates to \"squares ABCD and EFGH are inscribed in the same circle\". So they are both inscribed in the same circle, meaning all their vertices lie on that circle.\n\nBut then, if ABCD is a square inscribed in the circle, its diagonal is the diameter. Similarly, EFGH is a square inscribed in the same circle, so its diagonal is also the diameter. Therefore, both squares have the same diagonal length, hence the same side length. Therefore, BC=16 and FG=17 would imply different side lengths, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe BC and FG are not sides but something else? Wait, the problem says \"BC=16\", \"AB=107\", \"FG=17\", \"EF=184\". These are all straight line segments. So BC, AB, FG, EF are sides or parts of the squares.\n\nWait, maybe ABCD is a square with side AB=107, so BC=107, but the problem says BC=16. Contradiction again. Therefore, perhaps the labels are different. Maybe AB is a diagonal of square ABCD? If AB=107 is the diagonal, then the side length is 107/√2, and the radius is half the diagonal, so 107/(2√2). Similarly, BC=16 is a side, so the diagonal would be 16√2, and the radius would be 8√2. These would not be equal. Therefore, impossible.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe the problem is in the way the squares are positioned relative to each other. Let me consider", "answer": "104"}

The problem mentions that the rook moves from the light square to the dark square, and it's related to the number of moves it makes. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a chessboard is 8x8, with alternating light and dark squares. The rook moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares. Each move the rook makes changes the color of the square it's on. So, starting from a light square, each move takes it to a dark square, then to a light square, and so on. Therefore, the number of times the rook changes color is equal to the number of moves it makes. \n\nWait, the problem states that the rook \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reizes\" which translates to \"changes the color of the square exactly four times\". So, that means the rook must make four moves, right? Because each move changes the color. So starting on a light square, after four moves, it would be on a light square again (since even number of moves). But the problem says \"from the light square to the dark square\". Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reizes\" is a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Let me check the original problem again. It says: \"Atrodiet šādu ce transit skaitu,kas maina Virzienu tieši četras reizes, kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros.\" Translating each part:\n\n- \"Atrodiet šādu ce transit skaitu\" – \"Find the number of such a rook's path.\"\n- \"kas maina Virzienu tieši četras reizes\" – \"that changes the color of the square exactly four times.\"\n- \"kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros\" – \"as shown in the lower part of the figures.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" refers to the rook changing the color of the square four times. So the path starts on a light square, then changes color four times, landing on a dark square. Therefore, the rook makes four moves: starting on light, after first move dark, second move light, third move dark, fourth move light. Wait, but that would end on a light square. But the problem says \"from the light square to the dark square\". So maybe the path starts on a light square, ends on a dark square, and changes color four times. Let's see:\n\nNumber of color changes is equal to the number of moves. Starting on light, each move changes the color. So, if there are four color changes, that means four moves. Starting on light, after four moves, the color would be light again (since even number of moves). But the problem says \"from the light square to the dark square\", which would require the path to end on a dark square. So this is a contradiction. Wait, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Atrodiet šādu ce transit skaitu,kas maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes, kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros.\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- \"Atrodiet\" – find\n- \"šādu ce transit skaitu\" – number of such rook's paths\n- \"kas maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" – that changes the color of the square four times\n- \"kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros\" – as shown in the lower part of the figures.\n\nWait, maybe \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" is \"the rook changes the color of the square four times\". So the path consists of a rook moving from a light square to a dark square, changing color four times. So starting on light, four moves (four color changes), ending on dark. That would require an even number of moves? Wait, starting on light, after each move, the color flips. So four moves would end on light again. But the problem says \"from light to dark\", so maybe it's five moves? Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" means that the rook makes four moves, each time changing the color. But starting on light, four moves would end on light. So how can it end on dark? Maybe the problem is that the path starts on light and ends on dark, with four color changes (i.e., four moves). But that would mean starting on light, moving four times, ending on light. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the rook starts on a light square and ends on a dark square, and the number of times it changes color is four. So the number of moves is four, leading to ending on light, which contradicts ending on dark. Therefore, maybe the number of color changes is five? Wait, but the problem says four times. Hmm. Maybe there's a translation issue.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" could mean that the rook's movement crosses four lines, which divide the board into regions. For example, in chess, the lines between ranks and files might be considered, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the rook makes four moves, each time crossing a line (either a row or a column), thereby changing color each time. But in that case, the number of color changes is equal to the number of lines crossed, which is four. So starting on light, crossing four lines (four moves), ending on dark. Wait, but crossing a line (moving from one row or column to another) would change the color. For example, moving from a light square in a row to a dark square in the same row would require crossing a file or rank line? Maybe not. Wait, each square's color is determined by the sum of its coordinates. If you move horizontally or vertically, the color changes each time you cross a row or column line. Wait, no. If you move horizontally, the row remains the same, so the color depends on the column. Similarly, moving vertically, the column remains the same, so the color depends on the row. So, each move either changes the row or the column, but not both. Therefore, each move will change the color if the move is along a row or column that has a different parity. Wait, maybe not. Let's think with coordinates.\n\nSuppose the square is (x, y), where x and y are from 1 to 8. The color is determined by (x + y) mod 2. If you move horizontally from (x, y) to (x, y + k), then the color changes if (x + y) mod 2 != (x + y + k) mod 2, which is equivalent to k being odd. Similarly, moving vertically, the color changes if k is odd. So, moving an odd number of squares in a row or column changes the color, moving even number keeps the color the same. Therefore, the color changes when the move is of odd length (1, 3, 5, 7 squares), and same color if the move is even length (2, 4, 6, 8 squares). \n\nTherefore, the number of color changes is equal to the number of moves of odd length. So, if the rook makes four moves, each time changing color, then the total number of color changes is four. But starting on light, after four color changes, it would be on light again. But the problem says \"from light to dark\", so perhaps the total number of color changes is five? Wait, but the problem states four. Maybe I need to check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes, kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros.\" So, maybe the figure shows that the rook changes color four times. So, the path starts on light, changes four times, ends on dark. But that would require five moves: light -> dark (1), dark -> light (2), light -> dark (3), dark -> light (4), light -> dark (5). Wait, but that would be five moves. But the problem says \"four times\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the rook makes a tour that starts on a light square, ends on a dark square, and changes color four times. So the number of moves is four? But starting on light, four moves would end on light. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the problem is mistranslated or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes\" refers to the rook making four moves, each time changing the color, so four moves. Then starting on light, after four moves, it's on light, but the problem says \"from light to dark\", so maybe the path must end on dark, which would require five moves. But the problem states four. Maybe the problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the rook moves from a light square to a dark square, and the number of color changes is four. So, starting on light, moving to dark (1), then to light (2), then to dark (3), then to light (4), then to dark (5). Wait, but that's five moves. The problem says four times. I'm getting confused here. Maybe the problem is in the original language, and the translation is causing ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the rook moving on an 8x8 board, starting on a light square, moving to a dark square, and the number of such paths where the rook changes color exactly four times. Wait, but changing color each time it moves. So, starting on light, each move changes color. So, if it changes color four times, that means four moves, ending on light. But the problem says \"from light to dark\", so maybe it's five moves? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is translated incorrectly, and \"four times\" refers to the number of squares visited, but that seems unlikely. Wait, the original problem says: \"Atrodiet šādu ce transit skaitu,kas maina Virzienu tieši četras reikes, kā parādīts zemākesošajos piemēros.\" The key part is \"četras reikes\" – four times. So, four color changes. Starting on light, after four moves, it's back to light. But the problem says \"from the light square to the dark square\", so maybe the total number of color changes is five. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the rook makes a tour that starts on a light square, ends on a dark square, and changes color exactly four times. So, four color changes (four moves), but starting on light and ending on dark would require an odd number of moves. Wait, no. Starting on light, each move flips the color. So, number of moves: even number would end on light, odd on dark. Therefore, to go from light to dark, you need an odd number of moves. If the problem says four times (four color changes), which is four moves, that would end on light. So, contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem actually means five color changes (five moves), but mistranslated as four. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about paths that start on light, end on dark, and have four color changes, which would require five moves. Wait, but that would be five moves, leading to five color changes. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the number of times the rook alternates colors, but not necessarily consecutive moves. Wait, no, each move changes the color. So, the number of color changes is equal to the number of moves. Therefore, if the problem says \"changes color four times\", that means four moves. But starting on light, four moves would end on light. So how can it end on dark? Unless the problem allows the rook to start on dark and end on light, but the wording says \"from light to dark\". So maybe there's a mistake in the problem translation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the original language, and \"four times\" refers to the number of squares of one color, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe \"four times\" refers to the number of times it crosses between light and dark, but that would be the same as the number of moves. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the figure description given in the problem: \"as shown in the lower part of the figures.\" Since I don't have access to the figures, maybe I need to make an assumption. The problem mentions an 8x8 chessboard, and the rook moving from light to dark, changing color four times. Maybe the path is a rook's tour that starts on a light square, ends on a dark square, and changes color four times. But without the figure, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of rook's paths that start on a light square, end on a dark square, and have exactly four moves (i.e., four changes of color). But as we saw, starting on light, four moves would end on light, which is a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem is asking for paths that start on light, end on dark, and have four moves, which would require five color changes. But the problem says four. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Let's think differently. The problem might be asking for the number of rook's paths that start on a light square, end on a dark square, and pass through exactly four different colors. But that interpretation is a stretch. No, that's not likely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of color changes as in the number of times the rook moves from a light to dark or dark to light, regardless of the length of the move. So, each time it moves, it changes color. So, the number of color changes is equal to the number of moves. Therefore, if the problem says \"changes color four times\", that means four moves, starting on light and ending on light. But the problem says \"from light to dark\", so maybe it's a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the problem counts the number of color changes as the number of times the rook crosses from light to dark or dark to light, but not necessarily starting on light. Wait, but the problem mentions starting from the light square.\n\nThis is quite confusing. Maybe I need to look at the problem from another angle. The problem is in the style of a combinatorial problem where you count the number of paths with certain properties. For rooks, the number of paths from a starting square to an ending square in a certain number of moves. Since the ro", "answer": "294"}

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since \\(|z| = 4\\), that means \\(z\\) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. And we need to minimize the real part of that expression. Let me recall that for any complex number \\(w\\), the real part \\(\\text{Re}(w)\\) is just the x-coordinate if \\(w\\) is represented in the complex plane.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\). Let me denote this as \\(E(z) = (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\). Our goal is to find the minimum value of \\(\\text{Re}(E(z))\\) given that \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\nSince \\(|z| = 4\\), we can write \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\), varying from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\). Maybe substituting this into the expression will help. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\). Then, \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\). So, substituting into E(z):\n\n\\(E(z) = (75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\)\n\nLet me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nSecond term: \\(\\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\\theta} = \\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nLet me compute each term's real and imaginary parts.\n\nStarting with the first term:\n\nMultiply out \\(4(75 + 117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)\\):\n\nFirst, compute \\(75 + 117i\\) multiplied by \\(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\):\n\n= \\(75\\cos\\theta + 75i\\sin\\theta + 117i\\cos\\theta + 117i^2\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nBut \\(i^2 = -1\\), so:\n\n= \\(75\\cos\\theta + 75i\\sin\\theta + 117i\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nCombine real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: \\(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nImaginary part: \\(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta\\)\n\nThen multiply by 4:\n\nReal part: \\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nImaginary part: \\(4(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nSimilarly, compute the second term:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nFirst, multiply \\(96 + 144i\\) by \\(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\):\n\n= \\(96\\cos\\theta - 96i\\sin\\theta + 144i\\cos\\theta - 144i^2\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nAgain, \\(i^2 = -1\\):\n\n= \\(96\\cos\\theta - 96i\\sin\\theta + 144i\\cos\\theta + 144\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nCombine real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: \\(96\\cos\\theta + 144\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nImaginary part: \\(-96\\sin\\theta + 144\\cos\\theta\\)\n\nThen multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\nReal part: \\(\\frac{1}{4}(96\\cos\\theta + 144\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nImaginary part: \\(\\frac{1}{4}(-96\\sin\\theta + 144\\cos\\theta)\\)\n\nNow, combine the real parts of the first and second terms:\n\nReal part of E(z) = \\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}(96\\cos\\theta + 144\\sin\\theta)\\)\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary parts can be ignored since we only care about the real part. Let's compute this real part:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n= \\(4*75\\cos\\theta - 4*117\\sin\\theta + \\frac{96}{4}\\cos\\theta + \\frac{144}{4}\\sin\\theta\\)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468, 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36\n\nSo:\n\n= 300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ + 36sinθ\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ncosθ terms: 300 + 24 = 324\n\nsinθ terms: -468 + 36 = -432\n\nThus, Real part of E(z) = 324cosθ - 432sinθ\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of 324cosθ - 432sinθ as θ varies from 0 to 2π.\n\nThis is a standard trigonometric expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, which can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ) where C = sqrt(A² + B²). The minimum value is then -C.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nAny expression like A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is such that cosφ = A/C and sinφ = B/C. Therefore, the minimum value is -C, since the cosine function ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, in this case, A = 324 and B = -432.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude C is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).\n\nCompute that:\n\n324 squared: let's compute 300² = 90,000, 24² = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. Wait, but 324 is 300 + 24, so yes, 324² = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 400² = 160,000, 32² = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, same as 432² = 186,624.\n\nTherefore, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute sqrt(291,600).\n\nWell, 500² = 250,000, 600² = 360,000. So between 500 and 600. Let's see:\n\n500² = 250,000\n\n530² = (500 + 30)^2 = 500² + 2*500*30 + 30² = 250,000 + 30,000 + 900 = 280,900\n\n540² = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Ah, there we go.\n\nSo sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude C is 540. Therefore, the expression 324cosθ - 432sinθ ranges between -540 and +540. Therefore, the minimum real part is -540.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the coefficients:\n\nOriginal expression after substitution was 324cosθ - 432sinθ. So, A = 324, B = -432. Then, C = sqrt(A² + B²) = sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, hold on, but B is -432, so B² is 432². So yes, as above, 324² + 432² = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600, sqrt is 540. So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the real part is -540. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-540}.\n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations in the coefficients.\n\nStarting from E(z) = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z\n\nExpressed in terms of θ, z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}\n\nMultiply (75 + 117i) by 4e^{iθ}: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}\n\nSimilarly, multiply (96 + 144i) by (1/4)e^{-iθ}: (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*e^{-iθ}\n\nThen, expanding both terms:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)\n\n= 4*[75cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ]\n\n= 4*[75cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ]\n\n= 4*[ (75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) ]\n\nReal part: 4*(75cosθ - 117sinθ) = 300cosθ - 468sinθ\n\nSecond term: (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*(cosθ - i sinθ)\n\n= (1/4)*[96cosθ - 96i sinθ + 144i cosθ - 144i^2 sinθ]\n\n= (1/4)*[96cosθ - 96i sinθ + 144i cosθ + 144 sinθ]\n\n= (1/4)*[ (96cosθ + 144 sinθ) + i(-96 sinθ + 144 cosθ) ]\n\nReal part: (1/4)*(96cosθ + 144 sinθ) = 24cosθ + 36 sinθ\n\nAdding the real parts of both terms:\n\n(300cosθ - 468sinθ) + (24cosθ + 36 sinθ) = 324cosθ - 432sinθ\n\nYes, that's correct. So the real part is 324cosθ - 432sinθ, which has amplitude sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540. Therefore, the minimum is -540. So the answer is \\boxed{-540}.\n\nBut let me just think again if there's another approach. Maybe using calculus or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since |z| = 4, we can write z = 4e^{iθ}, and then E(z) = (75 + 117i)4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}\n\nBut perhaps we can write this in terms of trigonometric functions and then take derivative with respect to θ to find minima. But that might be more complicated. Since we already expressed the real part as 324cosθ - 432sinθ, which is a sinusoidal function, the minimum is straightforward as -C, where C is the amplitude. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inner product space: the expression A cosθ + B sinθ can be thought of as the dot product of vectors (A, B) and (cosθ, sinθ), and the maximum and minimum are the projection along those vectors, which gives the amplitude. So, the minimum value is indeed -sqrt(A² + B²). Therefore, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, I think the answer is confirmed. The minimal real part is -540.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest real part is \\boxed{-540}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the complex number \\( z \\) with \\( |z| = 4 \\), we need to find the smallest real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\).\n\nFirst, represent \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\", "answer": "540"}

Two of the circles, which are the incircle and an excircle, are tangent to the sides AB and BC. The incircle has a radius of 34, and there are 2024 unit circles (radius 1) inside the triangle. We need to find the inradius of the triangle expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. The incircle of a triangle is tangent to all three sides, and its radius (r) can be calculated using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. The excircle opposite to a vertex is tangent to the two adjacent sides and the extension of the opposite side. The exradius (r_a, r_b, r_c) can be calculated using r_a = A/(s - a), where a is the side opposite to vertex A.\n\nIn this problem, the incircle is tangent to AB and BC, which suggests that the ex-circle in question is the A-excircle or B-excircle? Wait, the problem mentions two circles: the incircle and another excircle tangent to AB and BC. Since the incircle is already tangent to AB and BC, the excircle must be tangent to the extensions of AB and BC. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the incircle is tangent to all three sides: AB, BC, and AC. But the problem states that the incircle and another excircle are tangent to AB and BC. Hmm, maybe the excircle is tangent to AB and BC but not AC? That would make sense. So, if the incircle is tangent to AB and BC, then the excircle must be tangent to the extensions of AB and BC. Wait, no. Wait, excircles are tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two. So, the A-excircle is tangent to BC and the extensions of AB and AC. Similarly, the B-excircle is tangent to AC and the extensions of AB and BC. So, if the incircle is tangent to AB and BC, then the excircle must be tangent to, say, AC and the extensions of AB and BC. Wait, but the problem says the incircle and another excircle are tangent to AB and BC. That seems conflicting. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Astoňi ap lacis ar rādienu 34 ir secīgi pieskars, un divi no ap lacis AB un BC trijst**\r\n**Translations:**\n1. **Problem 1:**\n\n   Let's consider a triangle with sides of integer lengths. The longest side has a length of 8, and the perimeter is 17. We need to determine the number of triangles possible under these conditions.\n\n   **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n   1. **Identify Given Values:** The longest side is 8, and the perimeter is 17. Let the sides be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) with \\(a \\leq b \\leq c = 8\\). The perimeter equation is \\(a + b + 8 = 17\\), so \\(a + b = 9\\).\n\n   2. **Triangle Inequality:** For valid triangles, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since \\(c = 8\\) is the longest side, we need \\(a + b > 8\\). But since \\(a + b = 9\\), this is automatically satisfied. Additionally, \\(a + 8 > b\\) and \\(b + 8 > a\\). Given \\(a \\leq b \\leq 8\\), the critical inequality is \\(a + 8 > b\\). Since \\(b = 9 - a\\), substitute to get \\(a + 8 > 9 - a \\implies 2a > 1 \\implies a > 0.5\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(a \\geq 1\\).\n\n   3. **Determine Possible Values:** Since \\(a \\leq b \\leq 8\\) and \\(a + b = 9\\), \\(b = 9 - a\\). The constraints \\(a \\leq b \\leq 8\\) translate to \\(a \\leq 9 - a \\leq 8\\). Solving \\(9 - a \\leq 8\\) gives \\(a \\geq 1\\), which is already satisfied since \\(a \\geq 1\\). For \\(a \\leq 9 - a\\), we have \\(a \\leq 4.5\\), so \\(a\\) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   4. **Check Each Case:**\n   - \\(a = 1\\): \\(b = 8\\). Check triangle inequality: \\(1 + 8 > 8\\) (true), \\(1 + 8 > 8\\) (true), \\(8 + 8 > 1\\) (true). Valid.\n   - \\(a = 2\\): \\(b = 7\\). All inequalities hold. Valid.\n   - \\(a = 3\\): \\(b = 6\\). Valid.\n   - \\(a = 4\\): \\(b = 5\\). Valid.\n   - \\(a = 5\\): \\(b = 4\\). But \\(b \\geq a\\) is required, so invalid.\n\n   5. **Count Valid Triangles:** There are 4 valid triangles: (1,8,8), (2,7,8), (3,6,8), (4,5,8).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of triangles is \\boxed{4}.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nGiven a semicircle with diameter 4 and center \\(O\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are endpoints. A point \\(C\\) divides the semicircle such that \\(|AC| = 3|BC|\\). We need to find the length of \\(OC\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Parameterize the Semicircle:** The semicircle has radius 2. Place the semicircle on a coordinate system with center \\(O\\) at the origin (0,0). The endpoints \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are at (-2,0) and (2,0) respectively.\n\n2. **Parametrize Point \\(C\\):** Let \\(C\\) be a point on the semicircle. The arc length from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) is three times the arc length from \\(C\\) to \\(B\\). The total circumference of the semicircle is \\(2\\pi r = 4\\pi\\), but since we are dealing with arc lengths, the total is \\(\\pi r = 2\\pi\\). However, since we are considering the arc lengths along the semicircle, each part is proportional to the angles subtended at the center.\n\n3. **Angle Subtended by Arcs:** Let the angle subtended by arc \\(AC\\) at the center be \\(3\\theta\\) and by arc \\(BC\\) be \\(\\theta\\). Thus, \\(3\\theta + \\theta = \\pi\\), so \\(4\\theta = \\pi \\implies \\theta = \\pi/4\\). Therefore, the angle for arc \\(AC\\) is \\(3\\pi/4\\) and for arc \\(BC\\) is \\(\\pi/4\\).\n\n4. **Coordinates of Point \\(C\\):** The angle from the positive x-axis to point \\(C\\) is \\(3\\pi/4\\) from point \\(A\\). Since point \\(A\\) is at angle \\(\\pi\\) (180 degrees), moving 3\\pi/4 radians towards \\(B\\) (which is at angle 0) gives the angle for point \\(C\\) as \\(\\pi - 3\\pi/4 = \\pi/4\\). Thus, coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((2\\cos(\\pi/4), 2\\sin(\\pi/4)) = (2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = (\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2})\\).\n\n5. **Distance from \\(O\\) to \\(C\\):** The distance \\(OC\\) is simply the radius, which is 2. However, verifying using coordinates: \\(OC = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{2 + 2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe length of \\(OC\\) is \\boxed{2}.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 3:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of two-digit numbers that are multiples of 3 and whose digits sum to an odd number.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Two-Digit Numbers Divisible by 3:** A two-digit number ranges from 10 to 99. The smallest multiple of 3 is 12, and the largest is 99. The sequence is 12, 15, 18, ..., 99. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 12, last term 99, common difference 3.\n\n2. **Count Total Multiples of 3:** The number of terms \\(n\\) is given by \\(n = \\frac{99 - 12}{3} + 1 = \\frac{87}{3} + 1 = 29 + 1 = 30\\). So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Check Digit Sum Parity:** We need to find how many of these numbers have digits summing to an odd number. The sum of digits \\(a + b\\) is odd if one digit is even and the other is odd.\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1:** Tens digit \\(a\\) is even, units digit \\(b\\) is odd.\n   - **Case 2:** Tens digit \\(a\\) is odd, units digit \\(b\\) is even.\n\n5. **Count Valid Numbers:**\n   - **Case 1:** Valid numbers are 12, 24, 36, 48, 78, 84, 96. Total 7 numbers.\n   - **Case 2:** Valid numbers are 15, 33, 51, 69, 87, 93. Total 6 numbers.\n\n6. **Total Valid Numbers:** \\(7 + 6 = 13\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of such two-digit numbers is \\boxed{13}.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 4:**\n\nGiven a sequence \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2024}\\) where each term is \\( \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\), and the partial sums \\(S_k = a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_k\\) are integers for all \\(k\\). We need to prove that all terms are equal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Partial Sums as Integers:** For each \\(k\\), \\(S_k\\) must be an integer. Given that each \\(a_i\\) is \\( \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\), the sum \\(S_k\\) involves irrational numbers. The only way their irrational parts cancel out is if the coefficients of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are zero.\n\n2. **Pairwise Products:** Consider the product \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\). Since \\(a_j\\) and \\(a_{j+1}\\) are each \\( \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\), their product is \\( \\pm \\sqrt{6} \\) or \\( \\pm 3 \\) or \\( \\pm 2 \\).\n\n3. **Partial Sums of Products:** Consider the partial sums of \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\). For these sums to be integers, the irrational parts (terms with \\(\\sqrt{6}\\)) must cancel out. However, each term is either \\( \\sqrt{6} \\), \\( -\\sqrt{6} \\), 3, or 2. The sum of such terms must be an integer only if the number of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) terms is even, leading to cancellation. But since the sequence is finite and the total sum is an integer, this implies that each product \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\) must be an integer.\n\n4. **Implications for Terms:** If \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\) is an integer, then \\(a_j\\) and \\(a_{j+1}\\) must be either both integers or both irrational numbers whose product is rational. However, the only irrational numbers allowed are \\(\\pm \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{2}\\), whose products are either \\(\\pm 3\\), \\(\\pm 2\\), or \\(\\pm \\sqrt{6}\\). For \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\) to be an integer, the product must be \\(\\pm 3\\) or \\(\\pm 2\\), implying that \\(a_j\\) and \\(a_{j+1}\\) are either both \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) or \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\), or both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n5. **Implications for the Sequence:** If consecutive terms must be the same, then the sequence cannot switch between \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) or their negatives. Otherwise, the product \\(a_j a_{j+1}\\) would involve \\(\\sqrt{6}\\), which is irrational. Hence, the sequence must be constant throughout. Therefore, all terms \\(a_j\\) are equal.\n\n**Proof Conclusion:** All terms must be equal to either \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\), \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), or \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\). Thus, all terms are equal.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 5:**\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) with inradius 34 and 2024 unit circles inside.

Atrodiet lielāko reālo skaitli, kas ir mazāks par $BD^2$ visiem šādiem rombiem.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus, and their diagonals intersect at the center of the hyperbola. We need to find the largest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus has all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the center of the hyperbola. The center of the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 is at the origin (0,0). So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. \n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if we consider the diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin, then each diagonal is bisected by the other. Therefore, if A is one vertex, then C must be the opposite vertex such that the midpoint of AC is the origin. Similarly for BD. So, if point B is (x, y), then point D must be (-x, -y). That's because the midpoint of BD is ((x - x)/2, (y - y)/2) = (0,0). So, BD is the line segment connecting (x, y) and (-x, -y), and AC connects (a, b) and (-a, -b).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, both A and B must satisfy the hyperbola equation. Let's write that down. For point A (a, b), we have a²/20 - b²/24 = 1. Similarly, for point B (x, y), x²/20 - y²/24 =1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, which should equal the distance from C to D, and so on. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps we can use the properties of the rhombus in terms of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the area can also be calculated as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the sides of the rhombus can be related to the diagonals. If we denote the diagonals as d1 and d2, then each side of the rhombus is sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2). So, the sides are equal to sqrt((d1² + d2²)/4). \n\nBut in this problem, we need to relate BD² to other things. BD is one of the diagonals. The problem asks for the largest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the minimum possible BD² and then the largest number less than all BD² would be the infimum of BD². But maybe there's a way to express BD² in terms of coordinates of A and B, then find its minimum.\n\nAlternatively, since BD is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), the length BD is sqrt[(x - (-x))² + (y - (-y))²] = sqrt[(2x)² + (2y)²] = 2*sqrt(x² + y²). Therefore, BD² is (2*sqrt(x² + y²))² = 4(x² + y²). So, BD² = 4(x² + y²). Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of 4(x² + y²) given that points A and B are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1. But wait, BD² is 4(x² + y²), so we need to minimize x² + y² for points B on the hyperbola. However, since BD² is 4 times that, the minimal BD² would correspond to the minimal x² + y². But we need the largest real number less than BD² for all rhombi. Hmm, maybe this is the minimal BD², and the answer is that minimal value. But we need to confirm.\n\nWait, but BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, and in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy certain properties. The diagonals are not independent; they are related to the angles of the rhombus. So, if we fix BD, then AC is determined by the properties of the rhombus. But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we need to relate the coordinates of A and B such that both lie on the hyperbola and the figure is a rhombus.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of coordinates. Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then, point D is (-x, -y). Point A is (a, b), so point C is (-a, -b). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same length. Wait, but in a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal. So, the length AB should equal the length BC, etc. Let me check.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use vectors. Let me consider vectors. Suppose the rhombus is centered at the origin. Then, vectors OA, OB, OC, OD are position vectors of the points. Since it's a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB should satisfy certain conditions. But I might need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since diagonals intersect at the origin, and in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoints of both diagonals are the origin. Therefore, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (x, y), then D is (-x, -y). Then, the sides of the rhombus are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, the vector AB is (x - a, y - b), and the vector BC is (-a - x, -b - y). The lengths of AB and BC must be equal.\n\nSo, |AB| = |BC|. Let's compute |AB|² and |BC|².\n\n|AB|² = (x - a)² + (y - b)²\n\n|BC|² = (-a - x)² + (-b - y)² = (a + x)² + (b + y)²\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n(x - a)² + (y - b)² = (a + x)² + (b + y)²\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: x² - 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²\n\nRight side: a² + 2ax + x² + b² + 2by + y²\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\n(-2ax - 2by) - (2ax + 2by) = -4ax -4by = 0\n\nTherefore, -4ax -4by =0 ⇒ ax + by =0.\n\nSo, the condition for ABCD to be a rhombus is that ax + by =0. So, for the points A(a, b) and B(x, y) on the hyperbola, they must satisfy both the hyperbola equation and the condition ax + by =0.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, but we already used that to derive the condition ax + by =0. So, perhaps that's the key equation here.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD² = 4(x² + y²). So, we need to minimize x² + y² given that (x, y) is on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 and ax + by =0, where (a, b) is also on the hyperbola.\n\nBut we have two variables here: (a, b) and (x, y), but they are linked by ax + by =0. So, for each (x, y) on the hyperbola, we need to find (a, b) on the hyperbola such that ax + by =0, and then compute BD² =4(x² + y²). Then, find the minimum value of BD² over all such (x, y).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for given (x, y), there exists a (a, b) such that ax + by =0. So, (a, b) must lie on the hyperbola and lie on the line ax + by =0. Wait, but (a, b) is on the hyperbola, and the line ax + by =0 passes through the origin. So, (a, b) is a point on the hyperbola lying on the line ax + by =0. Wait, substituting (a, b) into the line equation: a*a + b*b =0? Wait, no. Wait, the line is ax + by =0. If we take a point (a, b) on this line, then ax + by =0. But (a, b) is also on the hyperbola. So, we have:\n\nFor a point (a, b) on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, it must satisfy a²/20 - b²/24 =1, and also a*a + b*b =0? Wait, no. Wait, the line is ax + by =0, which is the line connecting (a, b) and (-a, -b). So, if (a, b) is a point on this line, then plugging (a, b) into the line equation gives a*a + b*b =0? Wait, that can't be, unless a=0 and b=0, which is not on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me clarify. The line BD connects points B(x, y) and D(-x, -y). So, the line BD can be parametrized as t*(x, y) where t ranges from -1 to 1. So, any point on BD is (tx, ty). Therefore, the direction vector of BD is (x, y). So, the line BD is the set of points (tx, ty) for t ∈ ℝ.\n\nNow, the other diagonal AC connects points A(a, b) and C(-a, -b), which is the line AC parametrized as s*(a, b) for s ∈ ℝ. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, is that true? No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's a key property of a rhombus. So, the diagonals must be perpendicular. Therefore, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, the vector AC is (2a, 2b), and the vector BD is (2x, 2y). Wait, no: vector AC is from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), which is (-2a, -2b), and vector BD is from B(x, y) to D(-x, -y), which is (-2x, -2y). The dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2x) + (-2b)(-2y) = 4ax + 4by =0 ⇒ ax + by =0. Which is the same condition we derived earlier. So, indeed, the condition ax + by =0 is necessary for the diagonals to be perpendicular. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, given points A(a, b) and B(x, y) on the hyperbola, with ax + by =0, we need to find BD² =4(x² + y²). Our task is to find the minimal possible BD² over all such pairs (A, B).\n\nSo, BD² =4(x² + y²). To find the minimal BD², we need to minimize x² + y² given that (x, y) is on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 and there exists a point (a, b) on the hyperbola such that ax + by =0.\n\nAlternatively, for a given (x, y) on the hyperbola, we need to check if there exists a point (a, b) on the hyperbola such that ax + by =0. If such a point exists, then BD² =4(x² + y²) is possible. Therefore, the minimal BD² would be the minimal x² + y² over all (x, y) on the hyperbola for which there exists (a, b) on the hyperbola with ax + by =0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize the hyperbola and express the condition ax + by =0 in terms of parameters.\n\nLet me parametrize the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1. A standard parametrization for hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) * cosh(t), y = sqrt(24) * sinh(t). Alternatively, since the hyperbola is oriented along the x-axis, we can use rational parametrization, but hyperbolic functions might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, we can write points on the hyperbola as (x, y) where x = sqrt(20) secθ, y = sqrt(24) tanθ. But maybe using coordinates is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider solving for a and b in terms of x and y. Given that (a, b) is on the hyperbola, so a²/20 - b²/24 =1, and ax + by =0. So, we have two equations:\n\n1) a²/20 - b²/24 =1\n\n2) ax + by =0\n\nWe can solve equation 2) for, say, a: a = - (by)/x. Then substitute into equation 1):\n\n(- (by)/x )² /20 - b² /24 =1\n\nCompute that:\n\n(b² y²)/(20 x²) - b² /24 =1\n\nFactor out b²:\n\nb² [ y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 ] =1\n\nSo,\n\nb² = 1 / [ y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 ]\n\nSimilarly, since (x, y) is on the hyperbola, x²/20 - y²/24 =1 ⇒ y² = (x²/20 -1)*24\n\nTherefore, substitute y² into the expression for b²:\n\nb²", "answer": "480"}

So, we have 900 Aimeenas, and each of them owns at least one of the four items: dimant, golf, complex, or daisy. The numbers given are:\n\n- 195 own dimant\n- 367 own golf\n- 562 own complex\n- All 900 own daisy\n\nThen, there are some overlaps:\n\n- 437 own exactly two of the first three items (dimant, golf, complex)\n- 234 own exactly three of the first three items\n\nWe need to find how many own all four items, which includes those who own exactly all four and those who own exactly three (since if they own three of the first three and the fourth, daisy, then they have four). Wait, actually, the problem says \"pieder tieši trīs no šīm lietām\" which translates to \"pieder exactly three of the first three lietām\". So, those 234 are the ones who own exactly three of the first three items. Then, the ones who own all four would be part of the 437 who own exactly two of the first three, but wait, no. Wait, the 437 are those who own exactly two of the first three. So, if someone owns exactly two of the first three, they can still own the fourth (daisy). But does the problem say that each of the 900 owns the daisy? Yes, \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem pieder maisi balcony sirsniām.\" So everyone owns daisy. Therefore, the total number of people is 900, and each person has at least dimant, golf, complex, or daisy. But since everyone has daisy, maybe the daisy is just a base category. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of people who have all four items. Since daisy is a given for everyone, if someone has all four, they must have dimant, golf, complex, and daisy. So, the number we need is the intersection of dimant, golf, complex, and daisy. Since everyone has daisy, this is equivalent to the intersection of dimant, golf, and complex. \n\nBut wait, the 437 who own exactly two of the first three items—so those people have two of dimant, golf, complex, but not the third, and then they also have daisy. Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three of the first three items would have all three (dimant, golf, complex) plus daisy. So, the 234 are the ones who own all three of the first three plus daisy. Therefore, the total number of people who own all four items is 234. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"437 iedzīvotāji, kuriem pieder tieši divas no šīm lietām, un 234 iedzīvotāji, kuriem pieder tieši trīs no šīm lietām.\" So, \"tieši divas\" means exactly two, and \"trīs\" exactly three. So, those 437 have exactly two of the first three, and those 234 have exactly three of the first three. \n\nBut the total number of people is 900, each of whom has at least one of the four items, but since daisy is a given, everyone has daisy, so they all have the fourth item. Therefore, the people who have all four items are exactly the people who have daisy (which everyone does) and have all three of the first three items. However, the 234 who have exactly three of the first three would have all three (since exactly three of the first three) plus daisy, so they have all four. The 437 who have exactly two of the first three would have two of the first three plus daisy, so they have three items in total. Therefore, the people who have all four items are the 234 who have exactly three of the first three. \n\nBut wait, that would mean the answer is 234. But let me verify this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nD = dimant\n\nG = golf\n\nC = complex\n\nS = daisy (everyone has S)\n\nWe need to find |D ∩ G ∩ C ∩ S| = |D ∩ G ∩ C| since S is everyone.\n\nGiven:\n\n|D| = 195\n\n|G| = 367\n\n|C| = 562\n\n|S| = 900\n\nBut since S is a universal set, we can ignore it for the inclusion-exclusion part. Wait, but the total number of people is 900, and each person has at least one of D, G, C, or S. But since everyone has S, it's equivalent to everyone having S, and the other three items can be any combination. So, effectively, it's a 3-set problem where the universe is 900, and we have three sets D, G, C with sizes 195, 367, 562, and the overlaps.\n\nBut the problem states that 437 people have exactly two of D, G, C, and 234 have exactly three of D, G, C. So, in standard inclusion-exclusion terms, the total number of people is:\n\n|D ∪ G ∪ C| = total number of people with at least one of D, G, C. But since everyone has S, and S is a separate item, but since S is a given, the total number of people is 900, which is |D ∪ G ∪ C| ∪ {S} but since everyone is in {S}, the union is just 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ C| must be 900, because everyone has S, so the people not in D, G, or C are only those who don't have D, G, or C, but since they have S, but if they have S, they have all four items. Wait, no. Wait, if someone doesn't have D, G, or C, but still has S, then they have all four items? No, because they have S, but if they don't have D, G, or C, then they have only S. Wait, but the problem says \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem pieder maisi balcony sirsniām,\" which is \"Each of the 900 iedzīvotāji has a balcony.\" So, maybe the four items are dimant, golf, complex, and daisy, and everyone has all four? But that contradicts the rest of the problem where some have only one or two of the first three. Wait, maybe not.

Among the 900 iedzīvotāji, 437 own exactly two of the first three items (dimant, golf, complex), and 234 own exactly three of the first three items. Find the number of Aimeilas iedzīvotāji who own all four items (dimant, golf, complex, and daisy).\n\nSo, each iedzīvotājus has a balcony, which is the fourth item. The first three items can be owned by some people, with 437 owning exactly two and 234 owning exactly three. The rest (900 - 437 - 234 = 229) own none of the first three, but since they have the balcony, does that mean they own all four? Wait, if they don't own dimant, golf, or complex, but they have daisy (balcony), does that mean they own only daisy? But the problem says \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem petter Maisi balcony sirsniām,\" which is \"Each of the 900 iedzīvotāji has a balcony.\" So, the balcony is a given—they all have it. But the other items may or may not be owned. However, the problem states \"Atrodiet Aimeilas iedzīvotāju skaitu, kuriem pjinuvišas četras šīs lieties\"—i.e., own all four items. So, if someone has the balcony (daisy) and also has, say, dimant, golf, and complex, then they own all four. If they have the balcony but none of the first three, they own only the balcony, not all four. So, the people who own all four items are exactly those who own all three of the first three items plus the balcony. The problem says that 234 own exactly three of the first three items. So, those 234 must own all three of D, G, C, and also the balcony S. Therefore, those 234 are the ones who own all four items. The other 437 who own exactly two of the first three own two of D, G, C and the balcony S, so they have three items in total. The remaining 229 (900 - 437 - 234 = 229) own only the balcony S, so they have one item. Therefore, the number of people who own all four items is 234. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this with inclusion-exclusion to make sure. Let's denote:\n\nLet’s use the principle for three sets, since daisy is a separate. Wait, but maybe we can model it as three sets D, G, C, and everyone has S. So, the total number of people is the number of people in D ∪ G ∪ C ∪ S. But since everyone has S, this is equal to S (900) plus those who have none of D, G, C. But the problem says \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem peteris Maisi balcony sirsniām,\" which might mean that everyone has S, but maybe they don't have to own it? Wait, no, the original problem says \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem peteris Maisi balcony sirsniām,\" which translates to \"At each of the 900 iedzīvotāji, there is a balcony.\" So, the balcony is a physical feature, not an item owned. So, maybe the daisy is the item, and the balcony is just a location. Wait, the original problem in Chinese might have different nuances. The user provided the translation as \"Turklāt katram no 900 iedzīvotājiem peteris Maisi balcony sirsniām,\" which could mean that each iedzīvotājus has a balcony. So, the balcony is a given; they all have one. The items are dimant, golf, complex, daisy. So, each iedzīvotājus can own any combination of dimant, golf, complex, and daisy. The fact that they have a balcony (daisy) is a separate thing. So, the daisy is not an item that they might not own, but rather a physical location. Therefore, the problem is about owning dimant, golf, complex, or daisy, with everyone having daisy (balcony). So, the total number of people is 900, each of whom has at least one of dimant, golf, complex, or daisy (balcony). But since everyone has daisy, the problem is equivalent to: in a group of 900 people, each has at least dimant, golf, complex, or daisy (balcony). 195 have dimant, 367 have golf, 562 have complex, and all 900 have daisy. Among these, 437 have exactly two of dimant, golf, complex, and 234 have exactly three of those. We need to find how many have all four items (dimant, golf, complex, daisy). \n\nIn standard inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the formula is:\n\n|D ∪ G ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ C|\n\nBut here, since everyone is in the union (because they all have daisy), |D ∪ G ∪ C ∪ S| = 900, but S is everyone, so it's 900. Wait, perhaps we need to model it as three sets with a universal set. Alternatively, think of it as three sets D, G, C, and the total number is 900, with each person having at least one of D, G, C, or S (but S is everyone, so it's redundant). Wait, this is confusing. Let's think again.\n\nSince everyone has daisy, the problem is about the three items D, G, C. Each person has at least one of D, G, C, or S (but S is redundant because everyone has it). So, effectively, everyone has S, and their ownership", "answer": "73"}

Atrodiet $AB\\cdot AC$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the triangle has its circumcenter O and incenter I such that the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. The circumradius is 13 and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information that might relate the sides of the triangle in some way.\n\nI remember there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) to other triangle parameters. The formula is:\n\nOI² = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that. Yes, that's correct. So in this case, OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. Therefore, OI = √13.\n\nBut the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA and OI are perpendicular. That must mean that in the triangle, the inradius and circumradius have some special relationship here.\n\nNow, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIA = √(r² + (s - a)^2)\n\nWhere s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. Wait, let me confirm that. The inradius is r, and the incenter is located at distances of r from each side. The distance from the incenter to vertex A would depend on the position of A relative to the incenter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another formula. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by:\n\nIA = 2R sin(A/2)\n\nBut wait, R is the circumradius here. Let me check. If that's the case, then IA = 2*13*sin(A/2). But if IA is perpendicular to OI, then maybe there's a right triangle formed by IA, OI, and some other line?\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. Maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me assume that point O is at the origin. Then, since OI is a line of length √13, and IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can set up coordinates such that O is at (0,0), I is at some point along the x-axis or y-axis, and A is somewhere in the plane such that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, but OI is a vector from O to I, and IA is a vector from I to A. If they are perpendicular, then their dot product is zero. But maybe coordinate geometry is overcomplicating things here. Let me think of other approaches.\n\nAnother formula I remember is Euler's formula relating the distance between circumcenter and incenter:\n\nOI² = R² - 2Rr\n\nWhich we already used to find OI = √13. But with the perpendicularity condition, maybe we can relate this to other triangle parameters.\n\nI also recall that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R is given by R = (a b c)/(4Δ). So maybe combining these could help.\n\nBut we need AB·AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then, semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. The area can be written using Heron's formula: Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, since we have the inradius and circumradius, maybe we can find relations between the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trigonometric identities. Let's denote angle at A as α. Then, using the formula IA = 2R sin(α/2). Wait, if OI is perpendicular to IA, then maybe triangle OIA is a right triangle at A? Wait, no. OI is the line from O to I, and IA is the line from I to A. If they are perpendicular, then angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. So in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees? Wait, no. If OI is a line from O to I, and IA is a line from I to A, then if they are perpendicular, the angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. So at point I, the lines OI and IA meet at a right angle.\n\nTherefore, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI² + IA² = OA²\n\nBut OA is the circumradius R, which is 13. Wait, OI is √13, IA is some length, and OA is 13. So:\n\n(√13)² + IA² = 13²\n\n13 + IA² = 169\n\nIA² = 156\n\nTherefore, IA = √156 = 2√39\n\nBut from another formula, IA is also equal to √[r² + (s - a)^2]. Wait, is that the correct formula?\n\nWait, let me check. The distance from the incenter to vertex A. The coordinates of the incenter can be given in terms of the sides, but maybe there's a formula. Alternatively, in terms of angles and the inradius.\n\nWait, there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall. If we consider the inradius r, and the exradius opposite to A, but maybe not. Alternatively, using trigonometry. If we consider the incenter I, then the distance from I to A can be found using the formula:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(\\frac{A}{2})}\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If we split angle A into two angles of A/2 each, and the inradius r is the distance from I to BC, then in the right triangle formed by I, the foot of the inradius on BC, and vertex A, the hypotenuse IA would be r divided by sin(A/2). Because in that right triangle, the angle at I is A/2, the opposite side is r, so sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2). So yes, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nBut we also have another expression for IA from the right triangle OIA, which is IA = 2√39. So:\n\nr / sin(A/2) = 2√39\n\nGiven that r = 6, then:\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39\n\n=> sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13\n\nThen, cos(A/2) = √(1 - (39/169)) = √(130/169) = √130 / 13\n\nNow, perhaps we can find angle A from this. Since sin(A/2) = √39 / 13, then A/2 = arcsin(√39 / 13), so A = 2 arcsin(√39 / 13). Alternatively, maybe we can find cos A using the double angle formula.\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7/13\n\nSo cos A = 7/13.\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides. Let's recall that:\n\ncos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)\n\nBut we need to find AB·AC, which is bc. So if we can express a in terms of bc, or find another equation, maybe we can solve for bc.\n\nAlternatively, we can use other relations. Let's recall that the area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: using the inradius and semiperimeter, and using the circumradius and sides.\n\nFirst, area Δ = r*s = 6s\n\nAlso, Δ = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52\n\nSo 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s\n\nAlso, from the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos A = 7/13 => a² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nBut we need to relate this to other equations.\n\nWe also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2\n\nSo maybe we can set variables for the sides and try to solve the equations. Let me denote bc = x, which is what we need to find. Then, from the area expressions:\n\n6s = (a x)/52 => 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) = (a x)/52 => 3(a + b + c) = (a x)/26 => a x = 78(a + b + c)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula that relates the distance from the incenter to the vertex and the sides. Earlier, we found that IA = 2√39, and IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But we already found sin(A/2) = √39 /13, which gives us cos(A/2) = √130 /13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities involving the angles and sides. For example, the formula for the circumradius R = a / (2 sin A). Wait, yes, in any triangle, the circumradius R is given by R = a / (2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nGiven that R = 13, so 13 = a / (2 sin A) => sin A = a / (26)\n\nBut we also found cos A = 7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13\n\nTherefore, sin A = (2√30)/13\n\nBut from the circumradius formula, sin A = a / 26 => a = 26 sin A = 26*(2√30)/13 = 4√30\n\nSo side BC = a = 4√30\n\nNow, we have side BC = 4√30. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b. Then, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nBut a = 4√30, so a² = 16*30 = 480\n\nThus,\n\n480 = b² + c² - (14/13)bc\n\nBut we need to find bc. Also, from the inradius formula:\n\nr = 6 = Δ / s\n\nWhere Δ is the area, and s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2\n\nSo Δ = 6s = 6*( (4√30 + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4√30 + b + c) = 12√30 + 3b + 3c\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using sides and angle A:\n\nΔ = (1/2)bc sin A = (1/2)bc*(2√30/13) = (bc√30)/13\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions for Δ:\n\n(bc√30)/13 = 12√30 + 3b + 3c\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate denominators:\n\nbc√30 = 156√30 + 39b + 39c\n\nDivide both sides by √30:\n\nbc = 156 + (39b + 39c)/√30\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe we can find another equation involving b and c. Let's recall that we also have the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = b² + c² - (14/13)bc\n\nLet me denote bc = x, which is the value we need to find. Then, let's express b² + c² in terms of x and other terms.\n\nBut we need another relation. Let's consider that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2\n\nThe inradius formula is r = Δ/s => 6 = Δ/s => Δ = 6s\n\nBut we also have Δ = (1/2)bc sin A = (1/2)bc*(2√30/13) = (bc√30)/13\n\nTherefore, 6s = (bc√30)/13\n\nBut s = (4√30 + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(4√30 + b + c)/2 = (bc√30)/13\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n6*(4√30 + b + c) = (bc√30)/13\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n78*(4√30 + b + c) = bc√30\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So:\n\n78*4√30 + 78b + 78c = bc√30\n\nSimplify:\n\n312√30 + 78(b + c) = bc√30\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nbc√30 - 78(b + c) = 312√30\n\nHmm. This seems complicated. Maybe we need to find another relation. Let's recall that from the Law of Cosines:\n\n480 = b² + c² - (14/13)bc\n\nLet me express b² + c² as (b + c)^2 - 2bc", "answer": "468"}

Since we have two equations and three variables, maybe we can reduce the problem by considering some substitutions or applying inequalities.

So, perhaps the solution has some symmetric properties. Maybe two variables are equal, or one is zero.\n\nFirst, let's check if one of the variables is zero. Suppose \\(c = 0\\). Then the first equation becomes \\(a + b = 300\\), and the second equation becomes \\(a^2b + b^2a = 6,000,000\\). Let's see if this is possible.\n\nLet \\(c = 0\\), so \\(a + b = 300\\). Then, substitute \\(b = 300 - a\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\(a^2(300 - a) + (300 - a)^2a = 6,000,000\\)\n\nFactor out \\(a(300 - a)\\):\n\n\\(a(300 - a)(a + (300 - a)) = 6,000,000\\)\n\nSimplify the inner term:\n\n\\(a(300 - a)(300) = 6,000,000\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\(300a(300 - a) = 6,000,000\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 300:\n\n\\(a(300 - a) = 20,000\\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation:\n\n\\(300a - a^2 = 20,000\\)\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\(a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0\\)\n\nSolving this quadratic equation:\n\nDiscriminant \\(D = 300^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000\\)\n\nSolutions:\n\n\\(a = \\frac{300 \\pm \\sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \\frac{300 \\pm 100}{2}\\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\(a = \\frac{300 + 100}{2} = 200\\) or \\(a = \\frac{300 - 100}{2} = 100\\)\n\nTherefore, if \\(c = 0\\), then \\(a = 200\\) and \\(b = 100\\), or \\(a = 100\\) and \\(b = 200\\). Both solutions are valid since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are symmetric. So, possible triples are \\((200, 100, 0)\\), \\((100, 200, 0)\\), and permutations considering \\(c\\) might be non-zero.\n\nBut the problem states \"skaitu\" which is plural, so maybe all permutations. However, let's check if there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero.\n\nSuppose all \\(a, b, c\\) are positive integers. Then, perhaps there's another set of solutions. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows zero, so the triples with two variables being 200, 100, and 0. But let's check if these satisfy the original second equation.\n\nTake \\((200, 100, 0)\\):\n\nCompute \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b\\):\n\n\\(200^2 \\times 100 + 200^2 \\times 0 + 100^2 \\times 200 + 100^2 \\times 0 + 0^2 \\times 200 + 0^2 \\times 100\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(40,000 \\times 100 + 0 + 10,000 \\times 200 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000\\). Perfect, that works.\n\nSimilarly, \\((100, 200, 0)\\) would also work. So these are valid solutions.\n\nBut the problem says \"trīskāršu\" which is \"triple\" in some languages, so maybe the answer is the number of such triples. But since \\(a, b, c\\) can be permuted, how many distinct triples are there?\n\nIn the case of \\((200, 100, 0)\\), permuting the variables, we can have:\n\n1. (200, 100, 0)\n2. (100, 200, 0)\n3. (200, 0, 100)\n4. (100, 0, 200)\n5. (0, 200, 100)\n6. (0, 100, 200)\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"skaitu\" which is \"pairs\" in some languages (plural of \"pair\"), but in this context, it might be \"triples\". However, the original problem is in Russian, and \"trīskāršu\" translates to \"triple\". So probably, the answer is the number of triples, considering permutations as distinct if the order matters.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's not specified whether order matters. However, in mathematics, unless specified otherwise, tuples are ordered. So (200, 100, 0) and (0, 200, 100) are different triples.\n\nBut let's check if there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero.\n\nSuppose all \\(a, b, c\\) are positive integers. Let's see if such solutions exist.\n\nWe can consider the equation:\n\n\\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\)\n\nLet me factor this expression. Notice that:\n\n\\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\\)\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\n\\(ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\\)\n\nBut since \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we can express \\(a + b = 300 - c\\), \\(a + c = 300 - b\\), \\(b + c = 300 - a\\). Let's substitute:\n\n\\(ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000\\)\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n\\(300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc = 6,000,000\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(300ab + 300ac + 300bc - 3abc = 6,000,000\\)\n\nFactor out 300:\n\n\\(300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\\)\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\\)\n\nLet me denote \\(S = a + b + c = 300\\), \\(P = ab + ac + bc\\), and \\(Q = abc\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\(100P - Q = 2,000,000\\)\n\nOur goal is to find non-negative integers \\(a, b, c\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(100P - Q = 2,000,000\\).\n\nWe can also recall that for three variables:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\(300^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2P\\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\(90,000 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2P\\)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \\(S = 300\\), \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\), and we need \\(100P - Q = 2,000,000\\), perhaps we can express \\(Q\\) in terms of \\(P\\) and substitute.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider possible values for \\(ab + ac + bc\\). Let's note that for given \\(a + b + c = 300\\), the maximum value of \\(ab + ac + bc\\) occurs when the variables are as equal as possible, and the minimum when one variable is large and the others are small.\n\nBut since we have \\(100P - Q = 2,000,000\\), and we need to find integers \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) such that this holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the previous substitution where we found solutions when one variable is zero. Let's check if those are the only solutions.\n\nEarlier, we found solutions where one variable is zero. Let's verify if there are other solutions where all variables are positive.\n\nSuppose all \\(a, b, c \\geq 1\\). Let's see if such solutions exist.\n\nGiven that \\(a + b + c = 300\\), and all are positive integers, the minimum value of \\(ab + ac + bc\\) is when variables are as equal as possible. For example, if \\(a = b = c = 100\\), then \\(ab + ac + bc = 3 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 30,000\\). Then \\(100P - Q = 100 \\times 30,000 - (100 \\times 100 \\times 100) = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\\). Wait, that's exactly the equation we have!\n\nSo if \\(a = b = c = 100\\), then:\n\n\\(ab + ac + bc = 3 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 30,000\\)\n\nThen \\(100P - Q = 100 \\times 30,000 - (100 \\times 100 \\times 100) = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\\), which satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, the triple \\((100, 100, 100)\\) is also a solution.\n\nWait, this is a symmetric solution where all variables are equal. So this is another solution.\n\nTherefore, there are two types of solutions:\n\n1. One variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100 (in some order).\n2. All variables are 100.\n\nNow, we need to check if these are the only solutions.\n\nSuppose there exists a solution where all variables are positive and not all equal. Let's see.\n\nTake for example \\(a = 150\\), \\(b = 150\\), \\(c = 0\\). Then, as before, \\(ab + ac + bc = 150 \\times 150 + 0 + 0 = 22,500\\). Then \\(100P - Q = 100 \\times 22,500 - 0 = 2,250,000\\), which is greater than 2,000,000. So this doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nAlternatively, take \\(a = 150\\), \\(b = 100\\), \\(c = 50\\). Then \\(S = 300\\), \\(ab + ac + bc = 150 \\times 100 + 150 \\times 50 + 100 \\times 50 = 15,000 + 7,500 + 5,000 = 27,500\\). Then \\(100P - Q = 100 \\times 27,500 - (150 \\times 100 \\times 50) = 2,750,000 - 750,000 = 2,000,000\\). Wait, this also satisfies the equation!\n\nSo here, \\(a = 150\\), \\(b = 100\\), \\(c = 50\\) is another solution. But wait, this contradicts our previous conclusion that only solutions with one variable zero or all variables equal work. So maybe there are more solutions.\n\nWait, let", "answer": "601"}

So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family F of segments PQ with unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB that is equidistant from A and B and also doesn't lie on any of the segments in F, except maybe AB itself. Then, we have to compute OC squared and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, and find p+q.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts. The family F consists of all unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, and the segment PQ is in the first quadrant. So, PQ is a line segment of length 1, starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis, entirely in the first quadrant. The point C is on AB, which is the line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). C is equidistant from A and B, meaning it's the midpoint of AB? Wait, no, equidistant in terms of distance from A and B? So that would be the point where CA = CB. That's the perpendicular bisector of AB. Let me check that.\n\nWait, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The midpoint of AB would be ((1/2 + 0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). But the problem says \"a unique point C on AB that is equidistant from A and B\". The set of points equidistant from A and B is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Since AB is a line segment in the first quadrant, the perpendicular bisector will pass through the midpoint and extend into the plane. However, since C is on AB, the only point on AB that is equidistant from A and B is the midpoint. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if you have a line segment AB, the perpendicular bisector is the line that is perpendicular to AB at its midpoint. So any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant to A and B. But the problem states that C is a point on AB that is equidistant from A and B. Wait, that seems contradictory unless AB is being considered as a line, not a segment. Wait, no, the problem says \"a unique point C on AB that is equidistant from A and B\". So AB is the segment, so the only point on AB that is equidistant to A and B is the midpoint. Because for any other point on AB, the distance to A and B would be different. Let me verify that.\n\nLet’s compute the distance from a general point on AB to A and B. Let’s parametrize AB. The coordinates of AB can be parametrized as follows: starting at A(1/2, 0) and moving towards B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, a parametric equation for AB can be written as (1/2 - t, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, actually, the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametrizing AB as A + t*(vector AB), where t ∈ [0,1]. So, coordinates would be (1/2 - t*(1/2), 0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2)) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). Then, the distance from a point C on AB with parameter t to A is sqrt( ( (1/2 - t/2 - 1/2 )^2 + ( t*sqrt(3)/2 - 0 )^2 ) ) = sqrt( ( (-t/2)^2 + ( t*sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ) ) = sqrt( t²/4 + 3t²/4 ) = sqrt(t²) = |t|. Similarly, the distance from C to B would be sqrt( (1/2 - t/2 - 0 )^2 + ( t*sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 - t/2)^2 + ( sqrt(3)/2 (t - 1) )^2 ). Let's compute this:\n\nFirst term: (1/2 - t/2)^2 = ( (1 - t)/2 )² = (1 - 2t + t²)/4\n\nSecond term: ( sqrt(3)/2 (t - 1) )² = (3/4)(t - 1)² = (3/4)(1 - 2t + t²)\n\nAdding them together: (1 - 2t + t²)/4 + (3/4)(1 - 2t + t²) = [1 - 2t + t² + 3 - 6t + 3t²]/4 = [4 - 8t + 4t²]/4 = (4t² - 8t + 4)/4 = t² - 2t + 1 = (t - 1)^2\n\nTaking the square root gives |t - 1|. Since t ∈ [0,1], this is 1 - t.\n\nTherefore, the distance from C to A is t, and the distance from C to B is 1 - t. So, setting t = 1 - t gives t = 1/2. Therefore, the midpoint of AB is the only point on AB that is equidistant from A and B, with distance 1/2 from each. So, point C is the midpoint of AB, which is ( (1/2 + 0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Wait, but according to the parametrization earlier, when t = 1/2, the coordinates would be (1/2 - (1/2)/2, (1/2)*sqrt(3)/2 ) = (1/2 - 1/4, sqrt(3)/4 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). So that's correct.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"a unique point C on AB that is equidistant from A and B, and that does not lie on any of the segments from F, except possibly AB itself.\" Wait, but the problem says \"nepieder nevienam segmentam no F\", which translates to \"does not lie on any of the segments from F, except possibly AB\". So, the point C is the midpoint of AB, which is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Now, we need to check whether this point lies on any of the segments in F, except AB. If it does, then the problem states \"kamattu notu, unikāls point C\", meaning that there is a unique such point. So, perhaps the midpoint lies on AB, which is part of F, so maybe that's the only point. But wait, AB is part of the family F? Because F is the family of segments PQ with unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So AB is a specific segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1, so AB is indeed a unit segment in F. Therefore, the midpoint of AB is on AB, which is part of F. Therefore, the problem is saying that C is a point on AB that is equidistant from A and B, and does not lie on any of the segments from F except possibly AB. So, if the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, then that's allowed. But is the midpoint the only such point? Wait, the problem says \"a unique point C on AB that is equidistant from A and B, and that does not lie on any of the segments from F, except possibly AB itself\". So, perhaps there are other points on AB that are equidistant from A and B, but they lie on other segments of F. But we just saw that the only point on AB equidistant from A and B is the midpoint. Therefore, if the midpoint is on AB (which is part of F), then that's the only such point. Therefore, C is the midpoint (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Then, we need to compute OC squared, which is the squared distance from the origin to C.\n\nSo, OC squared is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Therefore, OC squared is 1/4, so p = 1, q = 4, p+q = 5. But wait, the problem says \"Tad OC^2 = p/q... Atrodiet p+q\". But according to this, the answer is 5. However, I need to verify if the point C is indeed the midpoint and whether there are other points on AB that are equidistant from A and B but lie on other segments of F.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier analysis, the only point on AB equidistant from A and B is the midpoint. So, if the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, then that's the point. Therefore, OC squared is 1/4, so the answer is 5. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in parametrizing AB. Let me confirm the coordinates. A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1, so AB is indeed a unit segment. The midpoint is at ( (1/2 + 0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). The distance from this midpoint to A is sqrt( (1/4 - 1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (-1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 ) = sqrt(1/16 + 3/16 ) = sqrt(4/16 ) = 1/2. Similarly, distance to B is the same. So that's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"a unique point C on AB that is equidistant from A and B, and that does not lie on any of the segments from F, except possibly AB itself\". So, since the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, then the problem allows that. Therefore, C is the midpoint, and OC squared is 1/4, so p+q = 1+4=5. But the problem is in a more complex setup with the family F. Maybe there are other segments in F that intersect AB at the midpoint? Wait, AB is part of F, so if there are other segments in F that also pass through the midpoint, then the problem's statement might be different. Wait, but the problem says \"kamattu notu, unikāls point C\", which translates to \"the unique point C\". So, perhaps the midpoint is the only point on AB that is equidistant from A and B, regardless of whether it's on another segment from F. But according to our analysis, the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, so that's the only point. But maybe the problem is more complex. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"nepieder nevienam segmentam no F\", which is \"does not lie on any of the segments from F, except possibly AB itself\". So, if the point C is on AB, which is part of F, then that's acceptable. The problem doesn't say that C is not on any segment from F, just that it's not on any except AB. So, the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, so that's okay. Therefore, C is the midpoint, and OC squared is 1/4, so the answer is 5. But I need to check if there are other points on AB that are equidistant from A and B but lie on other segments of F. But according to the earlier reasoning, there's only one such point on AB, which is the midpoint. Therefore, OC squared is 1/4, so p+q is 5. But I need to verify if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not referring to the midpoint, but another point on AB that is equidistant from A and B but not the midpoint. But according to the distance calculation, any point on AB has distances t and 1 - t from A and B, respectively, where t is the parameter from 0 to 1. The only point where t = 1 - t is t = 1/2, which is the midpoint. Therefore, there are no other points on AB that are equidistant from A and B. Therefore, the unique point C must be the midpoint, which is on AB, hence part of F. Therefore, OC squared is 1/4, so the answer is 5. But let me check once again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not in the coordinate system I'm assuming. Let me check the coordinates again. O is (0,0), A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The midpoint is indeed (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), which is OC. Then, OC squared is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. So OC squared is 1/4, so p = 1, q = 4, which are coprime. Therefore, p + q = 5. So the answer is 5. But the problem seems to involve the family F of unit segments PQ in the first quadrant with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. The point C is on AB, equidistant from A and B, and does not lie on any of the segments in F except possibly AB. Since the midpoint is on AB, which is part of F, that's allowed. Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\nBut let me check if the midpoint (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lies on any other segment PQ", "answer": "23"}

I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 12. The minimal polynomial for ω over the rationals would be the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that helps here.\n\nThe expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me try to simplify this. Maybe factor out something? Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe rewrite it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me check if that's true. If I let y = ω^k, then the expression becomes y² - 2y + 2. So each term in the product is y² - 2y + 2 where y = ω^k. \n\nWait, so the product is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). That's interesting. Maybe there's a way to relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain roots. Since ω^k are roots of Φ₁₃(x), maybe I can consider a polynomial whose roots are related to ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the product is over k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me see if I can factor this expression. Let's denote z = ω^k, then the term is z² - 2z + 2. So the product is the product over z being ω^0, ω^1, ..., ω^12 of (z² - 2z + 2). So this is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial P(z) = product_{z=ω^k} (z² - 2z + 2). But since ω^k are the 13th roots of unity, except for z=1, but wait, ω^0 = 1. However, in the problem statement, ω ≠ 1, but here we are including k=0, which gives z=1. Wait, but ω is a primitive 13th root, so ω^0 = 1, but the problem says ω ≠ 1. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Atrodietiet, kad prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) tiek halved ar 1000.\" So ω is a 13th root of unity, not necessarily primitive, but not equal to 1. However, in the product, k goes from 0 to 12, so ω^k would include 1 when k=0. But ω ≠ 1, so does that mean ω is a primitive root? Because if ω is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1, then it must be primitive. Because 13 is prime, so the only roots are 1 and the primitive ones. So yes, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nTherefore, the product is over all 13th roots of unity z = ω^k (k=0 to 12) of (z² - 2z + 2). So the product is equal to the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for all z^{13} = 1. So maybe I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at the roots of x¹³ - 1. Since x¹³ - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x - ω)(x - ω²)...(x - ω¹²). Then, if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product over all roots z^{13}=1 of Q(z) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x¹³ - 1. But I might not remember the exact formula for that. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that if we have a polynomial P(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1. But here, we have a product of Q(z) over z^{13}=1. So perhaps if we can write the product as product_{z^{13}=1} Q(z) = product_{z^{13}=1} (z² - 2z + 2). \n\nAlternatively, note that if we have a polynomial P(x) = x¹³ - 1, then the product of (x - z) for all z^{13}=1 is P(x). But here, we need to compute the product of Q(z) for all z^{13}=1, where Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2. So perhaps if we can relate this product to the value of some other polynomial. Let me think. The product over z^{13}=1 of Q(z) is equal to the product over z^{13}=1 of (z² - 2z + 2). Let me consider that product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if we have a polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product we want is the product of f(z) over all z^{13}=1. So this is like evaluating the product of f(z) for all roots z of x¹³ - 1. There is a formula for such products. In general, for a polynomial f(x) and another polynomial g(x) with roots α_i, the product of f(α_i) over all roots α_i of g(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, up to a sign. But I might need to recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, since x¹³ - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k), then if we take the logarithm of the product, we can turn it into a sum, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe use generating functions.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let me consider that the product over z^{13}=1 of (z² - 2z + 2) can be written as product_{z^{13}=1} (z² - 2z + 2). Let me make a substitution. Let me set w = z. Then, since z^{13} = 1, we can write the product as product_{w^{13}=1} (w² - 2w + 2). Alternatively, perhaps note that z² - 2z + 2 = (z - 1)^2 + 1. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, note that z² - 2z + 2 = z² - 2z + 1 + 1 = (z - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, interesting. So (z - 1)^2 + 1. So maybe if we consider the product over z^{13}=1 of [(z - 1)^2 + 1]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use complex numbers. Since z is a root of unity, z = e^(2πik/13). Then, (z - 1)^2 + 1 = (e^(2πik/13) - 1)^2 + 1. Not sure if that helps. Maybe expand it:\n\n(z - 1)^2 + 1 = z² - 2z + 1 + 1 = z² - 2z + 2, which is the original expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if we have a polynomial f(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product over all z^{13}=1 of f(z) is equal to the product_{z^{13}=1} (z² - 2z + 2). Let me think about how to compute this product.\n\nAnother approach: Let me consider that for each z^{13}=1, we can write z² - 2z + 2 = z² - 2z + 2. Let me factor this quadratic. The roots of z² - 2z + 2 = 0 are z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product over z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So this product is equal to [product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))][product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i))]. \n\nBut product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial z^{13} - 1 evaluated at z = a, right? Wait, no. Wait, product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1 when a ≠ 1. Wait, actually, if we have a polynomial P(z) = z^{13} - 1, then the roots are z^{13}=1, so product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = P(a) / (a^{13} - 1) when a is not a root of P(z). Wait, no. Wait, actually, if P(z) = product_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k) = z^{13} - 1. Then, product_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k) = z^{13} - 1. Therefore, if we fix a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} - 1. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If we take a = 0, then product_{k=0}^{12} (0 - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} ω^k. But product_{k=0}^{12} ω^k = ω^{0 + 1 + ... + 12} = ω^{(12*13)/2} = ω^{78} = (ω^{13})^6 = 1^6 = 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (0 - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} * 1 = -1. But according to a^{13} - 1, when a=0, it's 0 - 1 = -1. So that works. Similarly, if a=1, product_{k=0}^{12} (1 - ω^k) = 1^{13} - 1 = 0, which is correct because ω^0=1 is included. So yes, the formula holds: product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} - 1. Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-1)(a - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^{13} - 1). Wait, so if we reverse the order, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1). \n\nSo in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (z - (1 + i)) = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (z - (1 - i)) = - [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. Therefore, the original product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ][ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]. \n\nSo, the product is equal to [(1 + i)^13 - 1][(1 - i)^13 - 1]. So now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then take the result modulo 1000. \n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. Note that (1 + i) has a modulus of sqrt(2) and an argument of π/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(i * 13 * π/4). Similarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(-i * 13 * π/4).\n\nBut let's compute 13 * π/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since e^(iθ) is periodic with period 2π, e^(i * 3π + i * π/4) = e^(iπ/4) * e^(i3π) = e^(iπ/4) * (-1)^3 = -e^(iπ/4). Similarly, e^(-i * 13π/4) = e^(-i * 3π - i * π/4) = e^(-iπ/4) * e^(-i3π) = e^(-iπ/4) * (-", "answer": "321"}

A \"b-skstus\" number n is one where when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 in base 13 is 63 (so digits 6 and 3), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. \n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. For a number n to be b-skstus, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b and b² - 1, inclusive. Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is b (which is 10_b) and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b² - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b).\n\n2. The sum of the two digits of n in base b is equal to sqrt(n). So, if n in base b is \"ab\", then a + b = sqrt(n). Here, a and b are the digits, so they must be integers between 0 and b-1, with a being at least 1 (since it's a two-digit number).\n\nSo, for each base b, we need to find all numbers n such that:\n\n- b ≤ n ≤ b² - 1\n\n- When n is written in base b as digits a and c (where a is the first digit and c is the second), a + c = sqrt(n)\n\nThen, we need to find the smallest base b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nThe example given is base 13 and n=81. Let's verify that:\n\nIn base 13, 81 divided by 13 is 6 with a remainder of 3. So 81 is 6*13 + 3 = 63_13. Then 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So that works.\n\nSo, the task is to find the minimal b ≥ 2 where the count of such numbers n is more than 10.\n\nFirst, let's try to model this.\n\nFor a given base b, a two-digit number in base b is n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits, so 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nWe can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na² + 2ac + c² = ab + c\n\nRearranging terms:\n\na² + 2ac + c² - ab - c = 0\n\nLet's factor this equation if possible. Hmm, maybe group terms:\n\na² - ab + 2ac + c² - c = 0\n\nTake terms with a:\n\na² - ab + 2ac = a(a - b + 2c)\n\nThen remaining terms:\n\nc² - c = c(c - 1)\n\nSo overall:\n\na(a - b + 2c) + c(c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of a:\n\na² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a. For integer solutions a, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c² - c) = 4c² - 4bc + b² - 4c² + 4c = -4bc + b² + 4c\n\nSo D = b² - 4bc + 4c\n\nFor a to be an integer, D must be a perfect square. So:\n\nb² - 4bc + 4c = k², where k is an integer.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, for given b and c, check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, for each base b, iterate over possible c (from 0 to b-1) and see if the equation a + c = sqrt(a*b + c) has an integer solution a between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, rearrange the equation:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nSo:\n\na² + 2ac + c² = ab + c\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na² + 2ac + c² - ab - c = 0\n\nLet me factor terms with a:\n\na² - ab + 2ac - c + c² = 0\n\nHmm, maybe factor a from first three terms:\n\na(a - b + 2c) + c² - c = 0\n\nAlternatively, solve for a:\n\na² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0\n\nThis is quadratic in a. So, for each c, we can solve for a:\n\na = [-(2c - b) ± sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4*(c² - c))]/2\n\nSimplify discriminant:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c² - c) = 4c² -4bc + b² -4c² +4c = -4bc + b² +4c\n\nSo D = b² -4bc +4c\n\nFor a to be integer, D must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, for each base b, and for each c from 0 to b-1, compute D = b² -4bc +4c and check if it's a perfect square. If yes, then solve for a and check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1. If so, then that (a,c) pair gives a valid n = ab + c.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, note that from the original equation:\n\na + c = sqrt(ab + c)\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(ab + c). Then s must be an integer because the left side is the sum of two digits, which are integers. So s is an integer, and n = s².\n\nTherefore, n must be a perfect square. So for each base b, we can consider all perfect squares n between b and b² -1, and check if n in base b has two digits whose sum is sqrt(n).\n\nBut n must be a perfect square, so possible n values are s² where s is an integer such that b ≤ s² ≤ b² -1.\n\nWait, s² must be at least b and at most b² -1. Therefore, s must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b² -1). Since s is an integer, s starts from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b² -1)).\n\nBut sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so floor(sqrt(b² -1)) = b -1. Therefore, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1. For each such s, check if s² in base b has two digits whose sum is s.\n\nSo, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], convert s² to base b, check if the sum of the two digits is s, and count how many such s there are.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nThis approach might be more manageable.\n\nLet me test this with the example given, base 13.\n\nIn base 13, b=13. So s ranges from ceil(sqrt(13))=4 to 12 (since b-1=12). So s from 4 to 12. For each s from 4 to 12, compute s² and check if in base 13, when written as two digits, their sum is s.\n\nBut wait, s² in base b must be two digits. For b=13, s ranges up to 12, so s²=144. But 144 in base 13 is 144 /13 = 11 with remainder 1, so 11*13 +1=144. So digits 11 and 1. Sum is 12, which is s=12. Wait, but the example says 81 is 63 in base 13, which is s=9, sum 6+3=9. But in this approach, s=9, s²=81, which in base 13 is 63, sum 6+3=9. So that works. But according to the previous idea, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(13))=4 to 12. So s=4 to 12. For each s in 4 to 12, check if s² in base 13 has digits summing to s.\n\nLet's check s=9:\n\ns=9, s²=81. In base 13: 81 /13=6, remainder 3. So digits 6 and 3. Sum 6+3=9. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, s=12: s²=144. 144 /13=11, remainder 1. So digits 11 and 1. Sum 11 +1=12. Correct.\n\nBut how many such s are there? Let's check for b=13:\n\ns from 4 to 12 inclusive. That's 9 values. But the example says 81 (s=9) is one such number. Are there others?\n\ns=10: s²=100. 100 /13=7, remainder 9. So digits 7 and 9. Sum 7+9=16 ≠10. Not valid.\n\ns=8: s²=64. 64 /13=4, remainder 12. So digits 4 and 12 (which is 'C' in some bases, but here it's 4 and 12). Sum 4+12=16≠8. Not valid.\n\ns=7: s²=49. 49 /13=3, remainder 10. Digits 3 and 10. Sum 13≠7.\n\ns=6: 36 /13=2, remainder 10. Digits 2 and 10. Sum 12≠6.\n\ns=5:25 /13=1, remainder 12. Digits 1 and 12. Sum 13≠5.\n\ns=4:16 /13=1, remainder 3. Digits 1 and 3. Sum 4= s. So s=4, n=16. So 16 in base13 is 13 +3=16. Wait, 1*13 +3=16. So digits 1 and 3. Sum 1+3=4. So s=4. So 16 is also a b-skstus number in base13. So s=4 and s=9 and s=12. So three numbers. But the example says 81 is one. So in base13, there are three such numbers. So maybe my initial thought was wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the example is 81=63_13 with 6+3=9=sqrt(81). But when s=4, n=16=13 +3=16, so digits 1 and 3. Then 1+3=4=sqrt(16)=4. So 16 is also a b-skstus number. So in base13, there are three numbers: 16, 81, 144. Wait, s=12: 144=11*13 +1=144, digits 11 and 1. Sum 11+1=12. So that's three numbers. So in base13, there are three b-skstus numbers.\n\nBut the problem says \"Atrodietiet mazāko skaitli b ≥2, kuru ir vairāk nekā 10 bāzē b-skaistīos skaitlī\". So the minimal base where there are more than 10 such numbers.\n\nSo we need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10. Let's think about how the count increases with b.\n\nFor each base b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1]. The number of s is (b -1) - ceil(sqrt(b)) +1. So approximately b - ceil(sqrt(b)). But this is just the number of possible s values. For each s, we have to check if s² in base b has two digits summing to s.\n\nBut actually, not all s will satisfy this. For example, in base13, s=4,9,12 work. So three. So the count can vary.\n\nTo find the minimal b with more than 10 such numbers, we need to find when the number of s values where s² in base b has digits summing to s is greater than 10.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's try to see for different bases.\n\nFirst, let's try small bases and see how the count progresses.\n\nBase 2:\n\ns must be from ceil(sqrt(2))=2 to b-1=1. But 2 >1, so no s. So count=0.\n\nBase3:\n\nceil(sqrt(3))=2, s=2 to 2 (since b-1=2). So s=2.\n\nCheck s=2: n=4. In base3: 11 (since 3 +1=4). Sum 1+1=2. So count=1.\n\nBase4:\n\nceil(sqrt(4))=2, s=2 to 3.\n\ns=2: n=4. In base4: 10. Sum 1+0=1≠2.\n\ns=3: n=9. In base4: 21. Sum 2+1=3. So count=1.\n\nTotal:1.\n\nBase5:\n\nceil(sqrt(5))=3, s=3 to4.\n\ns=3: n=9. In base5: 14. Sum 1+4=5≠3.\n\ns=4: n=16. In base5: 31. Sum 3+1=4. So count=1.\n\nTotal:1.\n\nBase", "answer": "211"}

Each side of the star has a male or female symbol, and each taisnšana figure must alternate genders along the edges. The Asymptote code draws an example with three of these figures, but I can't see the image. Let me try to visualize a regular 12-pointed star. It's made by connecting every fifth point, right? Because a regular 12-pointed star can be drawn by connecting every k-th point, where k is a step that's co-prime with 12. Since 12 is 2^2 * 3, the co-prime numbers less than 12 are 1, 5, 7, 11. But drawing a star with step 1 would just be a 12-gon, so the star must use step 5, 7, or 11. But since stepping 5 and 7 are equivalent in a 12-pointed star (since 5 + 7 = 12), they would create the same star but traversed in opposite directions. So maybe there's only two distinct 12-pointed stars? Wait, no, the problem mentions \"divpadsmitstūrī\" which might be a specific type of 12-pointed star. Maybe it's one of the two possible regular 12-pointed stars? Or perhaps there are more? Hmm. Let me recall that a regular star polygon is denoted by {n/k}, where n is the number of points and k is the step. For n=12, possible k are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but {12/1} is a 12-gon, {12/2} is a hexagon, {12/3} is a square, {12/4} is another star, but actually, step k must be co-prime with n. So for n=12, co-prime k's are 5, 7, 11. But {12/5} is the same as {12/7} because 5 and 7 are inverses modulo 12. So maybe there are two distinct regular 12-pointed stars: one with step 2 (but 12/2 is a hexagon, so maybe not a star), wait no. Wait, actually, to make a star polygon, k must be such that 2 <= k < n/2 and gcd(n, k) = 1. So for n=12, k=5, 7, 11. But 5 and 7 are both greater than 2 and co-prime. So maybe there are two different star polygons: {12/5} and {12/7}, but since stepping 5 and 7 would produce the same star but rotated. Wait, no. Let me check. If you connect every 5th point in a 12-point circle, the resulting figure is the same as connecting every 7th point but in the opposite direction. So maybe they are considered the same? Or different? Hmm. The problem says \"divpadsmitstūrī\", which is a term from a language (maybe an AI-specific one?), but perhaps it's just a 12-pointed star. Anyway, the problem mentions that each taisnšana figure is made by placing symbols on each side of the star, with each side having a male or female symbol, and each figure must alternate genders along the edges. So the symbols alternate between male and female as you go around the star. Since the star is a closed figure with 12 edges (sides), the number of symbols is 12. Since they must alternate, the total number must be even? But 12 is even, so if we start with male, then female, male, etc., ending with female. Wait, but in a cycle, the last and first elements are adjacent. So if we alternate, the number of males and females must differ by at most one. But since 12 is even, they must be equal: 6 males and 6 females. So each taisnšana figure has exactly 6 males and 6 females, arranged alternately around the star. However, the problem mentions that each taisnšana figure has a specific structure where each taisnšina (I think that's a term for the symbol) is placed on each side, and each symbol is either male or female. So each edge has a symbol, and they alternate. So the total number of possible such figures would depend on the number of ways to assign genders alternately, considering the rotational symmetries of the star? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about accounting for rotational symmetries. Wait, the problem says \"taisnšana skaitu\" which means \"the number of such figures\". It probably counts all possible assignments where the genders alternate, without considering rotations or reflections as distinct. Or maybe they are considered distinct even if they can be rotated into each other. Hmm. The Asymptote code draws three examples, but I can't see the image. The code seems to draw a 12-pointed star with a shaded region and a diagonal line. Maybe the example figures have some shaded areas or specific patterns. But since I can't see the image, I need to proceed with the text description. The key points are: 1. It's a regular 12-pointed star. 2. Each side has a symbol (male or female). 3. The symbols alternate around the star. So the problem reduces to counting the number of such alternating colorings, considering the symmetries of the star. Wait, but does the problem consider two figures the same if they can be rotated or reflected into each other? The problem says \"how many such figures are there\". If it's considering labelings up to rotation and reflection, then we need to use Burnside's lemma. If not, then it's just the total number without considering symmetry. But the problem doesn't specify. However, in combinatorial problems like this, unless stated otherwise, we usually consider two figures different if they can be rotated or reflected into each other. So we need to count colorings up to the symmetries of the star. But first, let's recall that a regular 12-pointed star has dihedral symmetry, meaning it has rotational and reflectional symmetries. The dihedral group D12 has 24 elements: 12 rotations and 12 reflections. However, the specific type of the star (dodecagram) might have a different symmetry group. For example, if the star is a regular 12-pointed star with step 5, its symmetry group might be smaller? Wait, no. Wait, the dihedral group D12 is the symmetry group of a regular 12-gon, which has 12 sides. But a regular 12-pointed star (dodecagram) might have the same symmetry group, because it's derived from the regular 12-gon. Wait, actually, the regular star polygon {12/5} is the same as {12/7} rotated. So the symmetry group is still D12. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings under D12 action would require using Burnside's lemma. But first, let's clarify: if the star is a regular 12-pointed star, and each edge is a side where a symbol is placed, and the symbols alternate, then how many colorings are there? If we don't consider symmetries, since it's a 12-sided figure with alternating colors, the number would be 2: either starting with male and alternating, or starting with female and alternating. But since the star is a closed loop with 12 edges, starting with male or female would give two different colorings. However, the problem says \"alternating genders along the edges\", so if we have 12 edges, the number of possible colorings is 2 (since once you choose the starting gender, the rest are determined). But wait, in a cycle, if the number of edges is even, then the two colorings (starting with male or female) are distinct. If the number is odd, they would be the same. But here, 12 is even, so there are two colorings. However, the problem might be more complex because the star might have multiple components or the arrangement is more restricted. Wait, no. If it's a single closed figure with 12 edges, then the coloring must alternate, so starting with male or female gives two different colorings, and these are distinct because you can't rotate one into the other. Wait, but in the dihedral group, rotations can map one to the other? Wait, if you rotate the star by 180 degrees, then a coloring starting with male would become a coloring starting with female, because rotating by 180 degrees would flip the order. Wait, let's see. Suppose we have a star with 12 edges labeled 1 to 12 in order. If we color edge 1 as male, then edge 2 female, ..., edge 12 male (since 12 is even). If we rotate the star by 1 edge, then edge 1 becomes edge 12, which was originally male. So edge 12 is male, edge 1 is male, which would not alternate. Wait, perhaps the rotation would mess up the alternation. Wait, no. If we rotate the star by k positions, then the coloring would shift by k, but since the alternation is maintained, the coloring would still alternate. Wait, actually, if you rotate the entire star, the alternation is preserved because the relative positions are maintained. So if you have an alternating coloring, rotating it would result in another alternating coloring. However, if you start at a different edge, the coloring would still alternate. But in terms of distinct colorings under rotation, how many are there? For a cycle with 12 edges and two colors alternating, the number of distinct colorings under rotation is 2: one starting with male and alternating, the other starting with female. But since 12 is even, starting with male or female gives different colorings, and rotations can't make them the same. However, if you consider reflection, then reflecting the star could map male to female and vice versa. Wait, but reflections would invert the order. So if you have a coloring that alternates male-female-male-female..., reflecting it would result in female-male-female-male..., which is a different coloring unless all males and females are the same, which they aren't. So the reflection would map one coloring to the other. Therefore, using Burnside's lemma: the number of distinct colorings is (number of colorings fixed by each symmetry) averaged over the group. The dihedral group D12 has 24 elements: 12 rotations and 12 reflections. Let's compute the number of colorings fixed by each symmetry. First, the rotations: rotation by 0 degrees (identity). All colorings are fixed. There are 2 colorings (starting with male or female). Rotation by 180 degrees: to fix a coloring, the coloring must be invariant under 180-degree rotation. Since the star has 12 edges, rotating by 180 degrees swaps edge 1 with edge 7, edge 2 with edge 8, etc. For the coloring to be fixed under this rotation, edge 1 must equal edge 7, edge 2 must equal edge 8, and so on. But since the coloring is alternating, edge 1 is male, edge 2 female, edge 3 male, etc. Edge 7 would be edge 7: starting from edge 1, 7 is 6 edges away, which is equivalent to edge 1 + 6*step. Wait, in a 12-pointed star, the edges are arranged in a circle. So edge 7 is 6 edges away from edge 1. Since the step is 5 or something? Wait, no. Wait, the edges are the sides of the star. If the star is drawn by connecting every 5th point, then each edge corresponds to a chord of the circle. But the arrangement of edges may not be adjacent in the original 12-gon. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to clarify: a regular 12-pointed star can be considered as a 12-sided polygon with connections skipping a certain number of vertices. For example, {12/5} connects each vertex to the one 5 steps away. This creates a star with 12 vertices and 12 edges, each edge connecting two vertices 5 apart. However, the edges themselves form a star shape. But when considering the sides of the star as the edges of the figure, each edge is a straight line between two vertices. So the star has 12 edges, each connecting two vertices with a step of 5. Therefore, the edges are not adjacent in the original 12-gon, but they are adjacent in the star. Wait, but when we talk about alternating colors along the edges, does \"along the edges\" refer to the edges of the star (the sides) or the edges of the original 12-gon? The problem says \"each taisnšina atrodas—at the side of the figure\", so the figure is the 12-pointed star, which has 12 sides (edges). Each side has a symbol. So the star has 12 edges, each edge being a side of the star, and each edge is a straight line between two vertices. Therefore, the edges of the star are the sides, and they are arranged in a cycle of 12. Therefore, the alternation is along the edges of the star. Therefore, the figure is a 12-sided polygon (but a star-shaped polygon) where each side is a line segment, and each side must have a symbol alternating between male and female. So the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings, considering rotational and reflectional symmetries. Therefore, using Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry operation. The dihedral group D12 has 24 elements: 12 rotations (0°, 30°, ..., 330°) and 12 reflections. To compute this, we need to find for each symmetry, how many colorings are fixed by that symmetry. Let's first consider the rotations. The identity rotation (0°) fixes all colorings. There are 2 colorings: starting with male or female. Next, rotations by 30°, 60°, ..., 330°. For a rotation by k*30°, the number of fixed colorings depends on whether k divides 12 (i.e., the rotation by 30°, 60°, 90°, etc., correspond to rotations that are factors of 360°/12=30°). Wait, actually, the rotation by m edges (step", "answer": "315"}

I need to find the sum of the squares of all elements in a specific set of positive integers. The problem gives me three conditions: the sum of the elements is 30, the mode is 9, the median is a positive integer that is equal to its own position in the sorted list and doesn't appear in the set. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. So, the set must have multiple 9s, more than any other number. The median is the middle number when the set is ordered from smallest to largest. Since the median is a positive integer that is equal to its own position, that means if we sort the list, the median is at position k (where positions are counted starting from 1) and the value is k. Also, this median number doesn't appear in the set, which is interesting. So the median is a number that's in the middle of the sorted list, but it's not actually part of the set. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the median is the middle number, then it should be part of the sorted list. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nAh, the problem says: \"Saraksha mediāna ir pozitīvsveselskaitis,kas pats saramstā neseara.\" Translating that (I think) means the median is a positive integer that is equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set. So, for example, if the median is 3, it would be at position 3, but 3 is not in the set. That's a bit confusing. So the median is a number that's in the middle of the list, but isn't part of the list. That's possible if the list has an even number of elements? Wait, no. Wait, the median of a list is the middle element(s). If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But since the median here is a single integer, that implies the list has an odd number of elements. So the median is the middle element, which is an integer, and it's equal to its position in the sorted list. So the median is at position k, and its value is k. Also, this value k is not in the set.\n\nSo, for example, if the median is 5, then the list has 9 elements (since the median is the 5th element), and the 5th element is 5, but 5 is not in the set. Wait, no. If the 5th element is 5, then 5 must be in the set, right? Because the list is sorted. Wait, no. If the 5th element is 5, then 5 is at position 5, but the problem says the median is equal to its own position and it's not present in the set. Wait, that can't be. There's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, let me parse the original problem again. \"Saraksha mediāna ir pozitīvsveselskaitis,kas pats saramstā neseara.\" So the median is a positive integer that is equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set. So the median's value is equal to its position. For example, if the median is at position 5, then its value is 5, but 5 is not in the set. But if the median is 5, then 5 must be in the set because the list is sorted. Wait, no. If the median is at position 5, which is 5, then 5 is in the set. But the problem states that the median is not present in the set. Therefore, this seems impossible unless the median is not an element of the set. But if the median is at position k and its value is k, then unless k is not in the set. Wait, but if the value is k, then k must be in the set. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Maybe I misinterpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the median is equal to its own position in the sorted list. So, if the median is 3, then it's at position 3. But the problem says the median is equal to its own position. So, the median's value is equal to its position. So, if the median is at position 3, then its value is 3. But if 3 is in the set, then the median would be 3. But the problem says the median is not present in the set. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the median is at position k, and its value is k, but k is not in the set. Wait, but if the value is k, then k is in the set. Therefore, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is translated in a way that \"the median is equal to its own position\". For example, if the median is 5, then it's at position 5. So, the median is 5, and it's at position 5. But if the median is 5, then 5 is in the set. But the problem says the median is not present in the set. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is mistyped? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem is in another language, and the translation is a bit off. Let me try to parse the original problem again in Vietnamese (assuming the user's original problem is in Vietnamese, given the structure):\n\n\"Danhliar_calculus is a set of positive integers with the following properties:\n- The sum of the elements is 30.\n- The unique mode is 9.\n- The median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\n\nFind the sum of the squares of all the elements in the set.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"the median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\" So, the median is a number that is equal to its position in the sorted list, and also, this number is not in the set. For example, if the median is at position 5, then the value is 5, and 5 is not in the set. But if 5 is the median, then it must be in the set because it's part of the sorted list. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the median is not an element of the set? But if the median's value is equal to its position, then the number at that position is equal to the position. So, for example, if the median is at position 4, then the fourth element is 4, but 4 is not in the set. Wait, but if the fourth element is 4, then 4 is in the set. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the median is not the number itself, but equal to its own position. Wait, the problem says: \"the median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\" So, the median is a number. Let's say the median is m. Then m is equal to its own position in the sorted list, so m is at position m in the sorted list. Also, m is not present in the set. So, for example, if m is 5, then position 5 is 5, but 5 is not in the set. But if position 5 is 5, then 5 must be in the set. Contradiction. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, maybe m is not an integer? But the problem states the median is a positive integer. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the median is equal to its own position, not that the median's value is equal to its position. Wait, the original problem says \"the median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\" So, the median is a number, which is equal to its own position. So, if the median is at position k, then the value is k, and it's not in the set. So, for example, if the median is 5, then 5 is at position 5, but 5 is not in the set. But if 5 is at position 5, then it must be in the set. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem is mistyped? Or perhaps I need to consider that the median is equal to its own position, but not necessarily the value. Wait, no. The median is a number. If it's equal to its own position, then position k has value k. So, if the median is at position k, then the value there is k, and k is not in the set. But since the set includes all elements in the sorted list, k must be in the set. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is equal to its own position, meaning that the median is equal to the position it occupies. For example, if the median is the 5th element, then the median is 5, but 5 is not in the set. Wait, but if the 5th element is 5, then 5 is in the set. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, unless the median is not an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, maybe there is a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps \"its own position\" refers to the value's position? No, the problem says \"its own position in the sorted list\". So, the median's value is equal to its position.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in another language, and \"its own position\" is a mistranslation. Maybe it's supposed to be \"the median is a positive integer that is equal to its value's position in the sorted list\". That is, the number 5 is at position 5. So, if the median is 5, then 5 is at position 5. But 5 must be in the set. Therefore, the median is 5, which is in the set. But the problem says the median is not in the set. Therefore, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is equal to the position of the median element. For example, if the set has 9 elements, the median is the 5th element. If the 5th element is 5, then the median is 5. But 5 is in the set, so this contradicts the condition that the median is not present in the set. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that the median is equal to the position it is in, but not necessarily the value. Wait, no. The median is a number. If it's equal to its own position, then the value is equal to the position. So, position 5 with value 5. Therefore, the set must include 5. But the problem says the median is not present in the set. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the problem is impossible? Maybe not. Maybe I misinterpret.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"Pozitīvuveseli skaitlīmu saražāda ir šāda īpašība:\n\n- Saraksha summa ir 30.\n\n- Saraksha unikālais moduli ir 9.\n\n- Saraksha mediāna ir pozitīvsveselskaitis,kas pats saramstā neseara.\"\n\nTranslating this:\n\n\"Saraka (set) has the following properties:\n\n- The sum of the elements is 30.\n\n- The unique mode is 9.\n\n- The median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\"\n\nSo, the key part is \"the median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list and it is not present in the set.\" So, the median is a number, which is equal to its own position in the sorted list, and this number is not in the set.\n\nTherefore, if the median is at position k, then the value is k, and k is not in the set. However, since the set is sorted, the k-th element is k. Therefore, k must be in the set. But the problem says the median is not present in the set. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"its own position\" refers to the value's position. For example, the number 5 is at position 5. Then, the median is 5, which is at position 5, and 5 is not in the set. But this is impossible because if 5 is at position 5, it must be in the set. Therefore, contradiction.\n\nWait, unless the number is at position k, but the value is not k. Wait, that's not what the problem says. The problem says \"the median is a positive integer equal to its own position in the sorted list\". So, the median's value is equal to its position. Therefore, if the median is at position 3, its value is 3. Therefore, 3 is in the set. But the problem says the median is not in the set. Contradiction. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, maybe the problem is mistyped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the median is equal to its own position\", meaning that the median is equal to the position it's in, but not necessarily the value. For example, if the median is the 3rd element, then its value is 3. But 3 is in the set. Therefore, same contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another language, and \"its own position\" is meant to refer to the index. For example, if the median is at index k (1-based), then its value is k. But in programming terms, indexes are 0-based, but here it's 1-based. So, if the median is at index k, its value is k. Therefore, the number k is in the set. Therefore, the median is k, which is in the set, contradicting the problem's statement that the median is not in the set.\n\nTherefore, this seems like a paradox. Maybe there is a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to find a way around it.\n\nWait, perhaps the median is a number that is equal to the position it occupies, but the number itself is different. Wait, no. If the median is at position k, then its value is k. Therefore, the number k is in the set. Therefore, the median is k, which is in the set. But the problem says the median is not in the set. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the problem is impossible? But the problem is given, so likely I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the median is not an integer, but the problem says it's a positive integer. Therefore, this is impossible.

So the problem is about placing digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the numbers formed by the digits read from top to bottom (so, the rows) equals 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by the digits read from left to right (so, the columns) equals 99. The example given is:\n\n0 0 8\n9 9 1\n\nWhich gives rows as 008 (but leading zeros might not count, so maybe it's 8, 99, and 91? Wait, no. Wait, the example says that 8 + 991 = 999. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, in the example, the grid is:\n\n0 0 8\n\n9 9 1\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, each row is a number. So the first row is 008, which is 8, the second row is 991. Then the sum of 8 + 991 is 999. But the problem says \"the sum of the numbers, which are formed by the digits, read from top, to bottom in each column.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Divu skaitļu summa,kas veidojauc, lasot no kreisās uz labo, būtu 999.\" Wait, \"no kreisās uz labo\" – that translates to \"from the left of the circle,\" but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe \"from top to bottom in each column\"? So each column is a number formed by the digits from top to bottom. So for a 2x3 grid, there are 3 columns, each column has 2 digits. So each column is a 2-digit number, but leading zeros might be allowed. Then the sum of these three 2-digit numbers should be 99. Additionally, the sum of the two rows (each row is a 3-digit number, but leading zeros might be ignored) should be 999.\n\nWait, but in the example, the rows are 008 and 991. If leading zeros are counted, then 008 is 8 and 991 is 991, sum 8 + 991 = 999. Then the columns: each column is a 2-digit number. The first column is 0 and 9, which is 09, but 09 is 9. The second column is 0 and 9, which is 09 (9). The third column is 8 and 1, which is 81. Then 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem requires filling a 2x3 grid with digits such that:\n\n1. The sum of the two rows (each row is a 3-digit number, possibly with leading zeros) is 999.\n\n2. The sum of the three columns (each column is a 2-digit number) is 99.\n\nEach cell in the grid must contain a digit (0-9), and we need to find all possible such grids.\n\nFirst, let's model the grid. Let's denote the grid as:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\nWhere a, b, c, d, e, f are digits from 0 to 9.\n\nThen, the rows are abc and def. If leading zeros are allowed, then the numbers are 100a + 10b + c and 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999.\n\nThe columns are:\n\na d (sum: 10a + d)\n\nb e (sum: 10b + e)\n\nc f (sum: 10c + f)\n\nTheir sum should be 99.\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999\n\n2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n\nWe need to solve these equations with a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ {0,1,...,9}\n\nLet me rewrite the equations:\n\nEquation 1:\n\n100a + 100d + 10b + 10e + c + f = 999\n\nEquation 2:\n\n10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(100a + 100d + 10b + 10e + c + f) - (10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f) = 999 - 99\n\nCalculating left side:\n\n100a -10a + 100d - d + 10b -10b +10e -e + c -10c + f -f\n\nWhich is:\n\n90a + 99d + 0b + 9e -9c + 0f\n\nSo:\n\n90a + 99d + 9e -9c = 900\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n10a + 11d + e - c = 100\n\nSo, equation 3: 10a + 11d + e - c = 100\n\nNow, we need to consider possible values for a, d, e, c.\n\nSince a and d are digits (0-9), let's see the possible ranges.\n\n10a can be from 0 to 90.\n\n11d can be from 0 to 99.\n\ne is a digit from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, 10a + 11d + e can range from 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 to 90 + 99 + 9 = 198.\n\nBut we have 10a + 11d + e - c = 100, so 10a + 11d + e = 100 + c\n\nSince c is a digit (0-9), 100 + c ranges from 100 to 109.\n\nTherefore, 10a + 11d + e must be between 100 and 109.\n\nBut 10a + 11d + e can be at maximum 90 + 99 + 9 = 198, which is way above, but here we need it to be between 100 and 109.\n\nSo, 100 ≤ 10a + 11d + e ≤ 109\n\nGiven that a and d are digits (0-9), let's try to find possible a and d such that 10a + 11d is in the range [100 - e], but since e is between 0-9, 10a + 11d must be between 100 - 9 = 91 and 109 - 0 = 109.\n\nBut 10a + 11d must be in [91, 109]. Let's see possible a and d:\n\n10a + 11d = N, where N is between 91 and 109.\n\nBut a and d are digits (0-9). Let's see possible values:\n\nFirst, note that 10a is a multiple of 10, 11d is a multiple of 11. So N = 10a + 11d must be a number that is 10a + 11d, with a and d digits.\n\nLet me list possible N from 91 to 109:\n\nStart with d=9:\n\n11*9=99. Then 10a +99 = N. So 10a = N -99. Since N ≤109, 10a ≤10. So a=1 (10*1=10). So N=99+10=109. So possible (a,d)=(1,9), N=109.\n\nd=8: 11*8=88. 10a= N -88. N can be from 91 to 109. So 10a= N -88. So N -88 must be between 1 and 10 (since 10a ≤90, but here a is a digit, so 10a ≤90, but N -88 can be up to 109 -88=21. Wait, but 10a must be ≤90. So N -88 ≤90 => N ≤178, which is always true. But N must be between 91 and 109. So N -88 is between 3 and 21. But 10a must be a multiple of 10. So N -88 must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, N must end with 8 or 9? Wait, N -88 is multiple of 10 => N ≡88 mod10 => N ≡8 mod10. So N must be 98 or 108. But N is between 91 and 109. So N=98 or 108. But 108 is within 91-109. So:\n\nIf N=98: 10a =98 -88=10 => a=1\n\nIf N=108: 10a=108 -88=20 => a=2\n\nTherefore, for d=8:\n\nPossible N=98 (a=1) and N=108 (a=2)\n\nSimilarly, d=7: 11*7=77. N=77 +10a.

But N ≤109, so possible N=87,97,107. But N must be between 91-109. So N=97,107.\n\nSo:\n\nN=97: 10a=97-77=20 => a=2\n\nN=107:10a=107-77=30 => a=3\n\nTherefore, for d=7: N=97 (a=2) and N=107 (a=3)\n\nd=6: 11*6=66. N=66 +10a. N between 91-109.\n\n10a= N -66. So N -66 must be between 25 (91-66=25) and 43 (109-66=43). 10a must be multiple of 10. So N -66 must be multiple of 10. Thus N=66 +10, 66+20, 66+30, 66+40. So N=76,86,96,106. But N must be between 91-109, so N=96,106.\n\nThus:\n\nN=96: 10a=96-66=30 => a=3\n\nN=106:10a=106-66=40 => a=4\n\nd=6: N=96 (a=3), N=106 (a=4)\n\nd=5: 11*5=55. N=55 +10a.

So N=95,105.\n\nN=95: 10a=95-55=40 => a=4\n\nN=105:10a=105-55=50 => a=5\n\nd=5: N=95 (a=4), N=105 (a=5)\n\nd=4: 11*4=44. N=44 +10a. N between 91-109.\n\n10a= N -44. N -44 must be between 47 (91-44=47) and 65 (109-44=65). 10a must be multiple of 10. So N -44=50,60.

N -33 must be between 58 (91-33=58) and 76 (109-33=76). 10a must be multiple of 10. So N -33=60,70. Thus N=33+60=93, 33+70=103.\n\nN=93:10a=93-33=60 => a=6\n\nN=103:10a=103-", "answer": "45"}

So, we have three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers, and they satisfy the following system of logarithmic equations:\n\nFirst equation: log₂(x/(y*z)) = 1/2  \nSecond equation: log₂(y/(x*z)) = 1/3  \nThird equation: log₂(z/(x*y)) = 1/4  \n\nAnd we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me start by recalling that log₂(a) = b implies that 2^b = a. So maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y*z)) = 1/2  \nThis means that 2^(1/2) = x/(y*z).  \nSo sqrt(2) = x/(y*z)  \nWhich can be rewritten as x = sqrt(2) * y * z.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x*z)) = 1/3  \nSo 2^(1/3) = y/(x*z)  \nWhich means y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.\n\nThird equation: log₂(z/(x*y)) = 1/4  \nTherefore, 2^(1/4) = z/(x*y)  \nSo z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1. x = sqrt(2) * y * z  \n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x * z  \n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x * y\n\nHmm, this seems a bit cyclic. Each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe we can substitute these equations into each other to solve for x, y, z.\n\nLet me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y * z  \nSo substitute x into equation 2:  \ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) * y * z) * z  \nSimplify the right-hand side: 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z².\n\nBut sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6).  \nTherefore, equation 2 becomes:  \ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nHmm, let's divide both sides by y (since y is positive, we can divide safely):  \n1 = 2^(5/6) * z²  \nSo z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)  \nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12) because z is positive.\n\nOkay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Now, substitute z back into equation 1 to find x.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y * z  \nWe know z = 2^(-5/12), and sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2). So x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12)  \nCombine the exponents: 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = 2^( (6/12 - 5/12) ) = 2^(1/12).  \nTherefore, x = 2^(1/12) * y.\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 3 to find z in terms of y? Wait, we already have z in terms of y? Wait, equation 3 is z = 2^(1/4) * x * y. And x is 2^(1/12) * y. So substitute that into equation 3:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) * y) * y  \n= 2^(1/4 + 1/12) * y²  \nConvert 1/4 and 1/12 to twelfths: 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.  \nSo z = 2^(1/3) * y².\n\nBut we already have z from equation 1 substitution: z = 2^(-5/12). So:\n\nFrom equation 1 substitution, z = 2^(-5/12).  \nFrom equation 3 substitution, z = 2^(1/3) * y².\n\nTherefore, set them equal:  \n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y²  \nDivide both sides by 2^(1/3):  \n2^(-5/12 - 1/3) = y²  \nConvert 1/3 to twelfths: 4/12.  \nSo exponent: -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.  \nTherefore, 2^(-3/4) = y²  \nTake the square root: y = 2^(-3/8)  \nSince y is positive.\n\nNow that we have y, we can find x from earlier: x = 2^(1/12) * y  \nSubstitute y = 2^(-3/8):  \nx = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8)  \nCombine exponents: 1/12 - 3/8.  \nConvert to 24ths: 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24.  \nSo x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSimilarly, we had z = 2^(-5/12). Let me check that against equation 3 substitution:\n\nFrom equation 3 substitution, z = 2^(1/3) * y²  \ny² = [2^(-3/8)]² = 2^(-3/4)  \nSo z = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-3/4) = 2^(1/3 - 3/4)  \nConvert to twelfths: 4/12 - 9/12 = -5/12.  \nYes, that's consistent with z = 2^(-5/12). Good.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)  \ny = 2^(-3/8)  \nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write all exponents with denominator 24 to see if that helps:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)  \ny = 2^(-9/24)  \nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo exponents are -7, -9, -10 over 24.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.\n\nFirst, compute x⁴ y³ z²:\n\nx⁴ = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24)  \ny³ = [2^(-9/24)]^3 = 2^(-27/24)  \nz² = [2^(-10/24)]^2 = 2^(-20/24)  \n\nMultiply them together:\n\n2^(-28/24 -27/24 -20/24) = 2^(-75/24)  \nSimplify the exponent: -75/24.  \nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.  \nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo m = 25, n = 8. Check if they are coprime: 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1. So yes, they are coprime.\n\nTherefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of logarithmic equations:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nwe convert these equations into exponential form:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\) implies \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\) implies \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\) implies \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\) into \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 2^{1/3} \\cdot (2^{1/2} \\cdot yz) \\cdot z \\implies y = 2^{1/3 + 1/2} \\cdot yz^2 \\implies y = 2^{5/6} \\cdot yz^2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n1 = 2^{5/6} \\cdot z^2 \\implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\implies z = 2^{-5/12}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( z = 2^{-5/12} \\) into \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12} \\implies x = 2^{1/2 - 5/12} \\cdot y \\implies x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y \\) into \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\):\n\n\\[\nz = 2^{1/4} \\cdot (2^{1/12} \\cdot y) \\cdot y \\implies z = 2^{1/4 + 1/12} \\cdot y^2 \\implies z = 2^{1/3} \\cdot y^2\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/3} \\cdot y^2 \\implies 2^{-5/12 - 1/3} = y^2 \\implies 2^{-9/12} = y^2 \\implies y = 2^{-3/8}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = 2^{-3/8} \\) into \\( x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2^{1/12} \\cdot 2^{-3/8} \\implies x = 2^{1/12 - 3/8} \\implies x = 2^{-7/24}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nx = 2^{-7/24}, \\quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \\quad z = 2^{-5/12}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right| \\):\n\n\\[\nx^4 = 2^{-28/24}, \\quad y^3 = 2^{-27/24}, \\quad z^2 = 2^{-20/24}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24} = 2^{-75/24} = 2^{-25/8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\\frac{25}{8} \\implies \\left| -\\frac{25}{8} \\right| = \\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m = 25 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\), giving \\( m + n = 33 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]", "answer": "33"}

So the problem is about a regular hexagon ABCDEF, where all sides are equal. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the lengths of the sides of the hexagon. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me visualize a regular hexagon. All sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. Each side is the same length, let's call that length 's'. Now, when they say the triangle is formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, I need to figure out how these extensions form a triangle.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, each side is adjacent to two other sides. If we extend AB, CD, and EF, those extensions should meet at some points to form a triangle. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Starting from point A, extending AB beyond B, then CD beyond D, and EF beyond F. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, sides AB and CD are not adjacent. Let me check the order of the hexagon: A, B, C, D, E, F, back to A.\n\nSo AB is the first side, BC the second, etc. So AB is adjacent to B and A. Then BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. So sides AB and CD are separated by BC and so on. So if we extend AB beyond B, and CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, how do these lines intersect to form a triangle? Maybe the triangle is formed by the intersections of these extended sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF until they meet each other? Let me think. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel. Since it's regular, opposite sides are parallel. So AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to EF, CD is parallel to FA, and so on. So if we extend AB, CD, and EF, since they are not opposite sides (AB is opposite ED, CD is opposite FA, etc.), but maybe when extended, they intersect each other?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, each side is separated by 60 degrees. The extensions of non-parallel sides might intersect at some points. Let me try to figure out the coordinates of the hexagon to model this.\n\nLet me place the hexagon in a coordinate system. Let's assume the center of the hexagon is at the origin (0,0), and one of the vertices, say A, is at (s, 0). Then, since it's a regular hexagon, the coordinates of the other vertices can be determined using 60-degree rotations.\n\nSo vertex A is at (s, 0). Vertex B would be at (s/2, (s√3)/2), vertex C at (-s/2, (s√3)/2), vertex D at (-s, 0), vertex E at (-s/2, -(s√3)/2), vertex F at (s/2, -(s√3)/2). Let me confirm that. Yes, each vertex is 60 degrees apart. So moving from A to B is 60 degrees up, then another 60 degrees to C, etc.\n\nNow, the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Let's write the equations of these sides and their extensions.\n\nFirst, side AB: from (s, 0) to (s/2, (s√3)/2). The slope of AB is [( (s√3)/2 - 0 ) / (s/2 - s)] = [ (s√3)/2 / (-s/2) ] = -√3. So the line AB has a slope of -√3. Its equation can be written as y - 0 = -√3(x - s), so y = -√3 x + s√3.\n\nSide CD: from (-s/2, (s√3)/2) to (-s, 0). The slope of CD is [0 - (s√3)/2] / [-s - (-s/2)] = [ - (s√3)/2 ] / (-s/2) = √3. So the line CD has a slope of √3. Equation: y - (s√3)/2 = √3(x + s/2). Simplifying: y = √3 x + √3*(s/2) + (s√3)/2 = √3 x + s√3.\n\nSide EF: from (-s/2, -(s√3)/2) to (s/2, -(s√3)/2). Wait, no. Wait, EF goes from E to F. E is (-s/2, -(s√3)/2), F is (s/2, -(s√3)/2). So EF is a horizontal line at y = -(s√3)/2, from x = -s/2 to x = s/2. Wait, but EF is a side of the hexagon. So its equation is y = -(s√3)/2. If we extend EF, it's still the same line, since it's already infinite. So the extension of EF is the same line.\n\nBut the problem says the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So if we extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, how do these lines form a triangle?\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle is formed by the intersections of the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let's see:\n\n1. Extend AB beyond B: AB has equation y = -√3 x + s√3. Extending beyond B would continue the line past B. Let's find where this extension intersects with the extension of CD or EF?\n\n2. Extend CD beyond D: CD has equation y = √3 x + s√3. Extending beyond D would continue the line past D.\n\n3. Extend EF beyond F: EF is the horizontal line y = -(s√3)/2. Extending beyond F would continue this line to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle is formed by the three intersection points of these extended lines:\n\n- The intersection of AB (extended) and CD (extended)\n- The intersection of CD (extended) and EF (extended)\n- The intersection of EF (extended) and AB (extended)\n\nIs that possible? Let me check.\n\nFirst, find the intersection of AB and CD.\n\nAB: y = -√3 x + s√3\n\nCD: y = √3 x + s√3\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-√3 x + s√3 = √3 x + s√3\n\nBring terms together:\n\n-√3 x - √3 x = s√3 - s√3\n\n-2√3 x = 0 => x = 0\n\nThen y = -√3*0 + s√3 = s√3\n\nSo intersection point is (0, s√3)\n\nSecond, intersection of CD and EF.\n\nCD: y = √3 x + s√3\n\nEF: y = -(s√3)/2\n\nSet equal:\n\n√3 x + s√3 = -(s√3)/2\n\n√3 x = -(s√3)/2 - s√3 = -(3s√3)/2\n\nx = -(3s)/2\n\nSo intersection point is ( -3s/2, -(s√3)/2 )\n\nThird, intersection of EF and AB.\n\nEF: y = -(s√3)/2\n\nAB: y = -√3 x + s√3\n\nSet equal:\n\n-(s√3)/2 = -√3 x + s√3\n\nBring terms together:\n\n-√3 x = -(s√3)/2 - s√3 = -(3s√3)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n√3 x = (3s√3)/2\n\nDivide both sides by √3:\n\nx = (3s)/2\n\nSo intersection point is ( 3s/2, -(s√3)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the three intersection points are:\n\n1. (0, s√3)\n\n2. (-3s/2, -s√3/2 )\n\n3. (3s/2, -s√3/2 )\n\nSo these three points form the triangle. Let's compute the lengths of the sides of this triangle.\n\nFirst, between (0, s√3) and (-3s/2, -s√3/2 )\n\nDistance formula: sqrt[ ( (-3s/2 - 0)^2 + ( -s√3/2 - s√3 )^2 ) ]\n\n= sqrt[ (9s²/4) + ( (-3s√3/2 )^2 ) ]\n\n= sqrt[ 9s²/4 + (27s²/4 ) ]\n\n= sqrt[ 36s²/4 ] = sqrt[9s²] = 3s\n\nSecond, between (-3s/2, -s√3/2 ) and (3s/2, -s√3/2 )\n\nDistance is sqrt[ (3s/2 - (-3s/2))^2 + ( -s√3/2 - (-s√3/2 ) )^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ (6s/2)^2 + 0 ]\n\n= sqrt[ (3s)^2 ] = 3s\n\nThird, between (3s/2, -s√3/2 ) and (0, s√3 )\n\nDistance: sqrt[ (0 - 3s/2)^2 + (s√3 - (-s√3/2 ))^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 9s²/4 + ( (3s√3)/2 )^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 9s²/4 + (27s²/4 ) ]\n\n= sqrt[ 36s²/4 ] = sqrt[9s²] = 3s\n\nWait a minute! All sides of the triangle are 3s. But the problem states that the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. But according to this, all sides are equal. That contradicts the given lengths. Hmm, so something is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption about the triangle's sides is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the triangle, kura malas ir segmentu AB, CD un EF pagentinājumi\", which translates to \"the triangle whose sides are the segments AB, CD, and EF\". Wait, but in the original problem statement, was it \"the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF\", or is it the triangle formed by the segments AB, CD, and EF? The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut the original problem says: \"Trijstūris, kura malas ir segmentu AB, CD un EF pagentinājumi, ir ar malu garumiem 200, 240 un 300.\" Which translates to \"The triangle, whose sides are the segments AB, CD, and EF, has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.\" So the triangle has sides AB, CD, EF. But in a regular hexagon, AB, CD, EF are sides of equal length. So how can their lengths be 200, 240, 300? That seems contradictory.\n\nTherefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Maybe the triangle is not the one formed by the segments AB, CD, EF themselves, but another triangle formed by extending those sides. But in my previous calculation, extending AB, CD, EF gives a triangle with all sides equal to 3s, which contradicts the given lengths. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle is not formed by the three intersection points I calculated. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\n\"Lai ABCDEF būtu izliekts vienādmalu sešstūris, čakas pretējo malu pāri ir paralēli. Trijstūris, kura malas ir segmentu AB, CD un EF pagentinājums, ir ar malu garumiem 200, 240 un 300. Atrodiet sešstūra malas garuru.\"\n\nSo \"Lai ABCDEF būtu izliekts vienādmalu sešstūris\" - \"Let ABCDEF be a regular hexagon, such that the opposite sides are parallel.\" Wait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are already parallel. So maybe that's just a confirmation.\n\n\"Trijstūris, kura malas ir segmentu AB, CD un EF pagentinājums, ir ar malu garumiem 200, 240 un 300.\" So \"the triangle, whose sides are the segments AB, CD, and EF, has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.\"\n\nBut in a regular hexagon, AB, CD, EF are all sides of the hexagon, hence equal in length. So how can their lengths be 200, 240, 300? This is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem must be referring to a different triangle, not the triangle formed by the sides AB, CD, EF. Therefore, the translation must have some issues. Wait, maybe \"the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF\" is the triangle whose sides are the extended segments. But in my previous calculation, that led to an equilateral triangle with sides 3s, which is not matching the given lengths. So perhaps my coordinate system is wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is not regular, but the problem says \" regular hexagon\". Wait, no, the problem says \"Lai ABCDEF būtu izliekts vienādmalu sešstūris\", which means \"Let ABCDEF be a regular hexagon...\" So it's definitely a regular hexagon. Therefore, the sides AB, CD, EF are equal. But the problem says the triangle formed by these segments has sides 200, 240, 300. Unless the segments AB, CD, EF are not the sides of the hexagon, but their extensions. Wait, no. The problem says \"segmentu AB, CD un EF...\", so it's the segments AB, CD, EF. But in a regular hexagon, those are sides, which are equal. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in Russian? The original user might have a different translation. The name \"Lai\" might be a typo or mis-translation. Alternatively, maybe \"sešstūris\" is \"hexagon\" and \"kura malas ir segmentu AB...\" is \"the triangle whose sides are the segments AB...\" etc. Maybe the problem is stating that in a regular hexagon ABCDEF, there exists a triangle whose sides are the segments AB, CD, and EF, and those lengths are 200, 240, 300. But in a regular hexagon, AB=BC=CD=DE=EF=FA. So unless the hexagon is not regular? But the problem says", "answer": "80"}

Then, we need to determine \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\), which are the quotient and remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000, respectively, and find \\( Q + R \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - \\( N \\) is a four-digit number.\n   - Increasing any single digit by 1 results in a number divisible by 7.\n   - \\( Q \\) is the quotient when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000.\n   - \\( R \\) is the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000.\n   - Find \\( Q + R \\).\n\n2. **Key Observations:**\n   - Since \\( N \\) is a four-digit number, \\( Q \\) must be between 1 and 9 (as \\( 1000 \\leq N < 10000 \\)).\n   - \\( R \\) is the last three digits of \\( N \\), so \\( R \\) ranges from 000 to 999.\n   - For each digit \\( d \\) in \\( N \\), increasing \\( d \\) by 1 and checking if the new number is divisible by 7.\n\n3. **Formulating the Conditions:**\n   - Let \\( N = d_1d_2d_3d_4 \\) where \\( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 \\) are digits.\n   - For each digit \\( d_i \\), \\( N_i = N + 10^{4-i} \\) must be divisible by 7.\n   - This gives four congruences:\n     - \\( N + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\) (increasing the units digit)\n     - \\( N + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\) (increasing the tens digit)\n     - \\( N + 100 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\) (increasing the hundreds digit)\n     - \\( N + 1000 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\) (increasing the thousands digit)\n\n4. **Simplifying the Congruences:**\n   - Each of these can be written as:\n     - \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -100 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -1000 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - Simplify each modulus:\n     - \\( -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( -10 \\equiv -10 + 14 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( -100 \\equiv -100 + 142 = 42 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( -1000 \\equiv -1000 + 1001 = 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n5. **Combining Congruences:**\n   - The conditions become:\n     - \\( N \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - These are contradictory unless there is a mistake.

Let's check the calculations again.\n\n6. **Re-evaluating Modulus Calculations:**\n   - **For increasing the units digit (10^0 = 1):**\n     - \\( N + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies N \\equiv -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - **For increasing the tens digit (10^1 = 10):**\n     - \\( N + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies N \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( -10 \\mod 7 = -10 + 14 = 4 \\implies N \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - **For increasing the hundreds digit (10^2 = 100):**\n     - \\( N + 100 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies N \\equiv -100 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( -100 \\div 7 = -14 \\times 7 = -98 \\), remainder \\( -100 + 98 = -2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - Wait, this contradicts previous steps. Let's compute \\( -100 \\mod 7 \\):\n       - \\( 100 \\div 7 = 14 \\times 7 = 98 \\), remainder 2. So \\( 100 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\)\n       - Therefore, \\( -100 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - **For increasing the thousands digit (10^3 = 1000):**\n     - \\( N + 1000 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies N \\equiv -1000 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( 1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\times 7 = 994 \\), remainder 6. So \\( 1000 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - Therefore, \\( -1000 \\equiv -6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n7. **Correct Congruences:**\n   - Now, the conditions are:\n     - \\( N \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - These are four different congruences. This suggests that \\( N \\) must satisfy all four simultaneously, which is impossible unless there is a mistake.\n\n8. **Revisiting the Problem:**\n   - The mistake lies in interpreting the effect of increasing any digit. When you increase a digit by 1, the number changes by \\( 10^{k} \\) where \\( k \\) is the position (0 for units, 1 for tens, etc.).\n   - However, the problem states that increasing any single digit by 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, for each digit position \\( k \\), \\( N + 10^{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n9. **Correct Congruence Setup:**\n   - For each digit position \\( k \\) (0 to 3), \\( N + 10^{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\).\n   - Therefore:\n     - \\( N \\equiv -10^{0} \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -10^{1} \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -10^{2} \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv -10^{3} \\pmod{7} \\)\n   - Compute each \\( -10^{k} \\mod 7 \\):\n     - \\( 10^0 = 1 \\implies -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( 10^1 = 10 \\implies -10 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( 10^2 = 100 \\implies -100 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n     - \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\implies -1000 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n10. **System of Congruences:**\n    - \\( N \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - \\( N \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - \\( N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n11. **Solving the System:**\n    - These congruences are inconsistent because \\( N \\) cannot simultaneously be congruent to 6, 4, 5, and 1 modulo 7.\n    - This suggests a different approach is needed.\n\n12. **Alternative Approach:**\n    - Since increasing any digit by 1 must make the number divisible by 7, \\( N \\) must be such that \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7} \\) when the units digit is increased, \\( N \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7} \\) when the tens digit is increased, etc.\n    - This implies that \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7} \\), \\( N \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7} \\), \\( N \\equiv -100 \\pmod{7} \\), \\( N \\equiv -1000 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n13. **Finding Consistent Values:**\n    - Compute each modulus:\n      - \\( -1 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n      - \\( -10 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n      - \\( -100 \\mod 7 = 5 \\)\n      - \\( -1000 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n    - Therefore, \\( N \\equiv 6, 4, 5, 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n14. **Finding a Common Solution:**\n    - Since these congruences are conflicting, we need a number \\( N \\) such that:\n      - \\( N \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - This is impossible unless there's a mistake. However, the problem states such a number exists, so we must have made an error in modulus calculations.\n\n15. **Correcting the Modulus Calculations:**\n    - Let's recompute each \\( -10^k \\mod 7 \\):\n      - \\( 10^0 = 1 \\implies -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( 10^1 = 10 \\implies 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\implies -10 \\equiv -3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( 10^2 = 100 \\implies 100 \\div 7 = 14 \\times 7 + 2 \\implies 100 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\implies -100 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\implies 1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\times 7 + 6 \\implies 1000 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\implies -1000 \\equiv -6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - The congruences are still inconsistent.\n\n16. **Realization:**\n    - There must be a different way to model the problem. Instead of considering each digit's increase separately, consider the difference between numbers when a digit is increased.\n\n17. **Difference Approach:**\n    - If increasing a digit by 1 changes the number by \\( 10^k \\) and results in a multiple of 7, then \\( 10^k \\equiv N \\mod 7 \\).\n    - However, since \\( N \\) is the original number, this approach might not work directly.\n\n18. **Considering the Number's Form:**\n    - Let \\( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\).\n    - When any digit is increased by 1, the new number is \\( N + 10^k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n    - Each \\( N + 10^k \\) must be divisible by 7.\n\n19. **Formulating Equations:**\n    - For each \\( k \\), \\( N + 10^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies N \\equiv -10^k \\pmod{7} \\).\n    - Therefore:\n      - \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv -100 \\pmod{7} \\)\n      - \\( N \\equiv -1000 \\pmod{7} \\)\n    - As before, these lead to different residues modulo 7.\n\n20. **Solving for \\( N \\):**\n    - The key is to find \\( N \\) such that all these congruences are satisfied. However, since the residues are different, we need to find a number that satisfies all simultaneously.\n    - This is only possible if all the residues are congruent modulo 7. However, they are not.\n\n21. **Reinterpretation:**\n    - The problem states that increasing any digit by 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position \\( k \\), \\( N + 10^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\).\n    - Let’s denote \\( N \\equiv x \\pmod{7} \\). Then:\n      - \\( x + 10^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\implies x \\equiv -10^k \\pmod{7} \\) for all \\( k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\).\n    - Therefore, \\( x \\) must be congruent to \\( -10^k \\pmod{7} \\) for all \\( k \\).\n    - But \\( -10^k \\pmod{7} \\) are different values, so the only way this holds is if all \\( -10^k \\equiv x \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n22. **Checking Consistency:", "answer": "699"}

Let me try to visualize it first. The torus is formed by rotating a circle around the y-axis. The problem states that the circle is rotated around the y-axis, and the sphere is such that the center of the circle (which becomes the center of the torus) is 6 units away from the center of the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is placed on the sphere, it touches the sphere along a line (a great circle?), and there's a certain radius of contact, r_i. Then, when the torus is flipped, it also touches the sphere along a line and has a different contact radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described as the set of points at a fixed distance (the radius of the tube) from a circle (the generating circle) in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. In this case, the generating circle has a radius of 3, and the torus is created by rotating this circle around the y-axis. The center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the center of the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sphere is such that the center of the circle is 6 units away from the center of the sphere.\" So the distance between the center of the generating circle (which is on the y-axis, let's say at (0, 6, 0) if we consider the y-axis in 3D space) and the center of the sphere is 6 units. But actually, the sphere's center is at some point, and the generating circle's center is 6 units away from that. Since the circle is rotated around the y-axis, the generating circle's center must lie on the y-axis. So the center of the sphere is also on the y-axis? Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since the torus is placed on the sphere, their centers must be aligned along the y-axis. So the sphere's center is on the y-axis, and the generating circle of the torus is also on the y-axis, 6 units away from the sphere's center. Wait, but the problem says \"the center of the circle is 6 units away from the center of the sphere.\" So if the sphere's center is at (0, 0, 0), then the generating circle's center is at (0, 6, 0). Then the torus is created by rotating this circle around the y-axis.\n\nBut when the torus is placed on the sphere, how is it positioned? The problem says when the torus is placed on the sphere, it touches along a line. So the torus is tangent to the sphere along a great circle. Similarly, when flipped, it's tangent along another great circle with a different contact radius.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key here is to model the torus and sphere in 3D coordinates and find the points of tangency. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let's assume the sphere's center is at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then the generating circle of the torus is at (0, 6, 0), with radius 3, and rotated around the y-axis. So the equation of the torus can be written in 3D coordinates.\n\nThe torus can be parametrized as follows: for θ and φ parameters, the coordinates are:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ\n\ny = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ\n\nz = 3 sin θ\n\nBut when we rotate the circle around the y-axis, θ parameterizes the circle in the x-z plane, and φ parameterizes the angle around the y-axis. So this parametrization makes sense.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.\n\nWhen the torus is placed on the sphere, they touch along a line. That line of contact is a great circle of the sphere, so it lies on a plane passing through the sphere's center. Similarly, when flipped, the contact is another great circle. The problem states that the torus has a radius of contact r_i when placed on the sphere, and r_o when flipped, and we need to find r_i - r_o.\n\nWait, the radius of contact here probably refers to the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere. But since the contact is along a great circle, the radius of that circle should be equal to the sphere's radius times the sine of the angle between the line connecting the centers and the line of contact. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, when the torus is placed on the sphere, the point of tangency is such that the torus is tangent to the sphere at a certain point (or along a circle). The radius of contact might be the radius of that circle. But if the contact is along a great circle, then the radius would be 11*sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the center of the sphere and the plane of the great circle. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radius of contact is the radius of the circle where the torus is tangent to the sphere. So for each placement (original and flipped), the torus touches the sphere at a certain circle, and the radius of that circle is r_i and r_o. We need to compute r_i - r_o.\n\nTo find this, we need to determine the points (or circles) where the torus is tangent to the sphere. Let's consider the torus and sphere equations.\n\nThe sphere: x² + y² + z² = 121.\n\nThe torus: Let's consider the parametrization I mentioned earlier. But perhaps it's easier to write the torus equation in standard form. The torus with major radius (distance from center to tube center) R and minor radius r has the equation:\n\n((x² + y²)/R² + (z²)/r²) = 1\n\nBut no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, the standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with tube radius a and major radius R is:\n\n(x² + y² + z² + R² - a²)^2 = 4R²(x² + y²)\n\nBut I might be misremembering. Alternatively, let's think in terms of rotating a circle around the y-axis. The generating circle is in the x-z plane, centered at (0, 6, 0) with radius 3. Rotating this around the y-axis gives the torus.\n\nSo any point on the torus can be written as ( (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, 3 sin θ ), where θ and φ are parameters each ranging from 0 to 2π.\n\nNow, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 121.\n\nAt the points of tangency, the torus and sphere share a common tangent plane, which implies that their gradients (normals) are parallel. So, the gradient of the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). The gradient of the torus can be found by taking the derivative of the torus equation with respect to x, y, z.\n\nLet's derive the torus equation. The parametrization is:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ\n\ny = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ\n\nz = 3 sin θ\n\nAlternatively, we can write the torus as ((x² + y²)/R² + (z²)/r²) = 1, where R is the major radius (distance from center to tube center) and r is the minor radius. But in this case, the generating circle is in the x-z plane, so the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. Therefore, the equation of the torus is ((x² + y²)/6²) + (z²)/3² = 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, when you rotate a circle around the y-axis, the standard equation is (x² + z²)/(R²) + y²/(r²) = 1, but I might be mixing up variables. Let me verify.\n\nSuppose we have a circle in the x-z plane, centered at (R, 0, 0), with radius r. When rotated around the y-axis, the resulting torus has major radius R and minor radius r. The equation for this torus is indeed (sqrt(x² + z²) - R)^2 + y² = r². Expanding this, we get x² + z² - 2 R sqrt(x² + z²) + R² + y² = r². But this seems complicated. Alternatively, another parametrization is:\n\nx = (R + r cos θ) cos φ\n\ny = (R + r cos θ) sin φ\n\nz = r sin θ\n\nWhich is similar to the earlier parametrization. So in this case, R = 6, r = 3. So the torus equation can be written as ((x² + z²)/6²) + y²/3² = 1? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFrom the parametrization:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ\n\nz = 3 sin θ\n\nSo x² + z² = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 cos² φ + 9 sin² θ\n\n= 9 (2 + cos θ)^2 cos² φ + 9 sin² θ\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe better to keep the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, the standard equation of a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r².\n\nYes, that's correct. So in this case, the major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3. Therefore, the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.\n\nExpanding this:\n\nx² + y² - 12 sqrt(x² + y²) + 36 + z² = 9\n\nWhich simplifies to x² + y² + z² - 12 sqrt(x² + y²) + 27 = 0.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, maybe we can use this equation to find the points of tangency.\n\nThe sphere is x² + y² + z² = 121. The torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.\n\nTo find the points where the torus and sphere intersect, we can set up the equations:\n\n1. x² + y² + z² = 121\n\n2. (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx² + y² + z² - [ (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² ] = 121 - 9\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + y² - (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 = 112\n\nLet’s let s = sqrt(x² + y²). Then the equation becomes:\n\ns² - (s - 6)^2 = 112\n\nExpanding (s - 6)^2:\n\ns² - (s² - 12s + 36) = 112\n\nSimplify:\n\ns² - s² + 12s - 36 = 112\n\n12s - 36 = 112\n\n12s = 148\n\ns = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 ≈ 12.333...\n\nSo sqrt(x² + y²) = 37/3. Therefore, x² + y² = (37/3)^2 ≈ 173.555...\n\nNow, plug back s = 37/3 into equation 2:\n\n( (37/3) - 6 )² + z² = 9\n\nCompute 37/3 - 6 = 37/3 - 18/3 = 19/3\n\nSo (19/3)^2 + z² = 9\n\n361/9 + z² = 81/9\n\nz² = 81/9 - 361/9 = -280/9\n\nWait, that can't be. z² is negative? That doesn't make sense. So this suggests that there's no real solution, which contradicts the problem statement that the torus is placed on the sphere. So maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, hold on. If the sphere has radius 11, then x² + y² + z² = 121. The torus equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9. When we subtract equation 2 from equation 1, we get x² + y² - (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 = 112. Then substituting s = sqrt(x² + y²), we get s² - (s - 6)^2 = 112. Which simplifies to 12s - 36 = 112, so 12s = 148, s = 148/12 = 37/3 ≈ 12.333. Then plugging back s into equation 2, we get (37/3 - 6)^2 + z² = 9. 37/3 - 18/3 = 19/3. (19/3)^2 = 361/9 ≈ 40.111. Then 361/9 + z² = 9 → z² = 81/9 - 361/9 = -280/9. Negative. That's impossible. So this suggests that the torus and sphere do not intersect? But the problem states that the torus is placed on the sphere, so they must touch. Therefore, there must be an error in my equations.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the torus equation. Let's re-examine. The generating circle is at (0, 6, 0) with radius 3. When rotated around the y-axis, the torus is created. The standard equation for a torus with major radius R (distance from center to tube center) and minor radius r is (sqrt(x² + z²) - R)^2 + y² = r². Wait, but in this case", "answer": "127"}

So, we have a 5x5 grid, right? There are 25 light blue zucchinis and 25 dark blue zucchinis arranged in this grid. The task is to find the number of ways to remove some of the zucchinis such that:\n\n1. Each row and each column contains at most one zucchini of each color. Wait, no, actually, the original problem says \"visi žetona vienā rindā un vienā kolonnā ir viena krāsas.\" Hmm, maybe I need to parse that again. Let me check the original problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem (translated): \"Atrodiet veidu skaitu, kā izvietot dažus no šien žetoniem 5×5 režģa 25 vienību šūnās tā, lai:  \n- Katra šūna satur ne vairāk kā vienu žetonu  \n- Visi žetona vienā rindā un vienā kolonnā ir viena krāsas  \n- jebkus papildu žetons, kās novietots uz režģa, pārkāptu vienu细致usāus no iepriekš minētajien divien nosacījumiem.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Each row and each column contains at most one zucchini. Wait, but there are two colors? So maybe each row and column can have at most one zucchini of each color? Or maybe each row and column must have exactly one zucchini, but of either color? Wait, the original problem says \"visi žetona vienā rindā un vienā kolónā ir viena krāsas.\" Translating that, \"All the zucchinis in each row and each column are one color.\" Hmm, maybe that means each row and each column can have only one zucchini, and that zucchini can be either color. But then there are 25 zucchinis, so exactly one per row and column, forming a permutation matrix, but with two colors. Wait, but there are 25 of each color. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the problem is in two colors: 25 light blue and 25 dark blue zucchinis. So the original grid has 25 of each, making 50 zucchinis. But the problem says \"izvietot dažus no šien žetoniem 25 anto 5x5 režģa 25 vienību šūnās.\" So maybe the original grid is 5x5 with 25 zucchinis of each color? Wait, that can't be, because 5x5 is 25 cells. So perhaps there's a translation issue. The original problem might have 5x5 grid with 25 zucchinis, each either light or dark blue, with 25 of each. So the grid is 5x5, 25 cells, each cell has a zucchini that is either light or dark blue. Then the problem is to remove some zucchinis such that:\n\n1. Each row and each column contains at most one zucchini (of any color). But since there are 25 cells, which is 5 rows and 5 columns, if each row and column can have at most one zucchini, then we can have at most 5 zucchinis in total, one per row and column. But there are 25 zucchinis in total. So this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem is that the original zucchinis are arranged in two colors, 25 light and 25 dark, but they are placed in the grid such that each row and column has the same number of each color? For example, a Latin square where each row and column has exactly one of each color, but since there are two colors, that would require 5 of each per row and column, but 5x5 grid with two colors would have 10 zucchinis, not 25. Hmm, maybe the problem is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is that there are 5x5 = 25 zucchinis in total, each either light or dark blue, with 25 of each? That doesn't make sense because 25 zucchinis can't be 25 of each color. Wait, maybe the problem is that there are 25 light blue and 25 dark blue zucchinis, making 50 zucchinis in a 10x10 grid? But the problem mentions a 5x5 grid. This is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Ir kaleidoskala ar 25 neatškovamām baltām žetoniem un 25 neatškovamām melnām žetoniem. Atrodiet veidu skaitu, kā izvietot dažus no šien žetoniem 5×5 režģa 25 vienību šūnās tā, lai:\"\n\nTranslating: \"In a 5x5 grid, there are 25 light blue zucchinis and 25 dark blue zucchinis. Find the number of ways to remove some zucchinis such that:  \n1. Each row and each column contains at most one zucchini.  \n2. All zucchinis in each row and each column are one color.  \n3. Any additional zucchinis removed must not violate the above two conditions.\"\n\nWait, so the initial setup is a 5x5 grid with 25 zucchinis, each either light or dark blue. But the problem states 25 of each, which would require 50 zucchinis. That must be a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the grid is 5x5, and each cell contains a zucchini, which can be either light or dark blue. So there are 25 zucchinis in total, but 25 of each color? That would require 50 cells, which contradicts the 5x5 grid. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 25 light blue and 25 dark blue zucchinis arranged in a 5x5 grid, but each cell can have multiple zucchinis? But the first condition says \"each row and each column contains at most one zucchini,\" so that can't be. Therefore, the problem must have a translation error. Given the confusion, perhaps the original problem is similar to a standard combinatorial problem where we have a 5x5 grid with two colors, and we need to count the number of ways to remove some zucchinis such that each row and column has at most one of each color. But the exact conditions are unclear.\n\nWait, the second condition says \"visi žetona vienā rindā un vienā kolónā ir viena krāsas.\" Translating: \"All the zucchinis in each row and each column are one color.\" So, in each row and each column, all the zucchinis must be the same color. That is, in any row or column, you can't have both colors. So if a row has a zucchini, it must be all light or all dark. Similarly for columns. But since there are 25 zucchinis, each row must have exactly 5 zucchinis, but each row can only have one color. So each row is either all light or all dark. Similarly, each column is all light or all dark. But there are 25 zucchinis in total. So, the number of light rows times 5 plus the number of dark rows times 5 equals 25. Similarly for columns. Wait, but if each row is either all light or all dark, then the total number of light zucchinis is 5 times the number of light rows, and similarly for dark. Since there are 25 zucchinis, the number of light rows plus the number of dark rows must be 5 (since there are 5 rows). Let L be the number of light rows, D the number of dark rows, so L + D = 5. Then total light zucchinis are 5L, dark zucchinis 5D. But 5L + 5D = 25, which is satisfied. But we also have the column constraints. Each column must be all light or all dark. So the number of light columns plus dark columns is 5. Similarly, the total light zucchinis must be 5L, but each light column contributes 5 light zucchinis, so total light zucchinis are 5 times the number of light columns. Similarly, dark zucchinis are 5 times the number of dark columns. Therefore, 5L = 5C, where C is the number of light columns. Thus, L = C. Similarly, D = 5 - L = 5 - C. Therefore, the number of light rows equals the number of light columns. Since L can be from 0 to 5, but L must equal C. So possible values of L are 0,1,2,3,4,5. But since L = C, and L + D = 5, C + D = 5. Therefore, possible configurations are when the number of light rows equals the number of light columns. For example, if there are 2 light rows, there must be 2 light columns. The rest are dark. Then total light zucchinis would be 2*5 =10, and dark zucchinis 5*3=15? Wait, no: If there are L light rows, each contributing 5 zucchinis, so total light zucchinis are 5L. Similarly, dark zucchinis are 5D, where D=5-L. But also, the number of light columns is L, each contributing 5 zucchinis, so total light zucchinis are also 5L. Therefore, it's consistent. Therefore, the possible configurations are those where the number of light rows equals the number of light columns. So for each L from 0 to 5, we can have L light rows and L light columns, and the rest dark. Then the number of light zucchinis is 5L, dark zucchinis 25 - 5L.\n\nBut the problem says \"atrodiet veidu skaitu, kā izvietot dažus no šien žetoniem...\" which translates to \"Find the number of ways to remove some zucchinis...\" So the original problem might be asking for the number of ways to remove zucchinis such that the remaining ones satisfy the two conditions: each row and column has at most one zucchini, and each row and column is monochromatic. Additionally, any additional zucchinis removed must not violate these conditions. Wait, the third condition says \"jebkus papildu žetons, kās novietots uz režgle, pārkāptu vienu pinīusāus no iepriekš minētajien divien nosacījumiem.\" Which translates to: \"Any additional zucchinis removed must not violate the previously mentioned conditions.\" So, the removal must satisfy that after removal, each row and column has at most one zucchini, and each row and column is monochromatic. And the count is the number of such possible removals.\n\nBut how does this work? The initial grid has 25 zucchinis, each either light or dark, arranged such that each row and column has some number of zucchinis. But the problem states there are 25 light and 25 dark zucchinis, which is impossible in a 5x5 grid. Therefore, there must be a mistranslation. Perhaps the original problem is about a 5x5 grid where each cell contains a zucchini that is either light or dark blue, with 25 of each color. Then, the problem is to remove some zucchinis such that:\n\n1. Each row and each column contains at most one zucchini.\n\n2. All zucchinis in each row and each column are of the same color.\n\n3. Any additional zucchinis removed must not violate conditions 1 and 2.\n\nBut how can we have 25 zucchinis in a 5x5 grid? There's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe it's a 10x10 grid? 10x10 grid has 100 cells, so 50 zucchinis (25 each). But the problem mentions a 5x5 grid. This is very confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about 5x5 grids with two colors, and the total number of zucchinis is 25 of each color, arranged in the grid such that each row and column has 5 zucchinis, but that also doesn't make sense with two colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to a chessboard, where each cell can be either light or dark, and we have to count the number of ways to place 25 zucchinis (12 light and 13 dark or something) such that each row and column has at most one zucchini, and each row and column is monochromatic. But the exact numbers are unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about a 5x5 grid where each cell contains a zucchini that's either light or dark blue, and we need to count the number of such grids that satisfy the conditions. But the problem is phrased as \"atrodiet veidu skaitu, kā izvietot dažus no šien žetoniem...\" which sounds like counting the number of subsets (removals) that satisfy the conditions. But the original problem might have been about counting the number of possible initial configurations, but the translation is unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should look for similar problems. The conditions resemble a Latin square but with two colors. If each row and column can have at most one zucchini, and each row and column must be monochromatic, then the only way this can happen is if each row and each column is either all light or all dark. But in a 5x5 grid, if each row is all light or all dark, then the entire grid is a combination of all light and all dark rows. Similarly, each column must be all light or all dark. However, for both rows and columns to be monochromatic, the grid must be such that it's a block matrix of all light and all dark blocks. For example, some number of rows are all light, and the rest are all dark; similarly for columns. But the intersection of a light row and a light column would be a cell that's both light and dark, which is impossible. Therefore, the grid must be partitioned into", "answer": "902"}
