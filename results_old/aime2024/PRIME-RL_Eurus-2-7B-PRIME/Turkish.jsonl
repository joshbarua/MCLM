We need to calculate this probability and express it in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon and the number of favorable outcomes where the mavi (blue) vertices end up in the initial positions of the kırmızı (red) vertices after rotation.\n\nSince each vertex can be either red or blue with equal probability, there are $2^8 = 256$ possible colorings of the octagon.\n\nWe need to find the number of favorable outcomes. For the mavi vertices to end up in the initial positions of the kırmızı vertices after rotation, the octagon must be rotated by an angle that maps the mavi vertices to the red vertices. The only rotation that can achieve this is a rotation by 180 degrees, which swaps the positions of the vertices.\n\nFor the 180-degree rotation to map the mavi vertices to the red vertices, the octagon must have an equal number of red and blue vertices, i.e., 4 red and 4 blue vertices. The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be red (and the remaining 4 to be blue) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\n\nHowever, not all of these colorings will satisfy the condition after a 180-degree rotation. We need to count the number of colorings that remain the same after a 180-degree rotation. This means that the color of each vertex must be the same as the color of the vertex directly opposite to it.\n\nWe can think of the octagon as being divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices. Each pair can be either red-red or blue-blue, and there are 2 choices for each pair. Therefore, the number of favorable colorings is $2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe probability that the mavi vertices end up in the initial positions of the kırmızı vertices after rotation is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible colorings, which is $\\frac{16}{256} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nNext action: [OUTPUT]\n\nThe probability that the mavi vertices end up in the initial positions of the kırmızı vertices after rotation is $\\frac{1}{16}$.

The direction changes occur when we switch from R to U or from U to R.

Since there are 8 R's and 8 U's, and we need exactly four direction changes, we can think of placing the four direction changes in the sequence. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 15 positions (between the R's and U's) where the direction changes occur.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that we need to place the direction changes in such a way that we have exactly four switches between R and U. This can be represented as arranging the sequence of R's and U's with exactly four switches.\n\nWe can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" or combinatorics to solve this.
