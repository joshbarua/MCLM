Each vertex of the octagon is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to calculate the probability of this event and express it in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nThe problem can be approached by considering the total number of possible colorings of the octagon and the number of favorable outcomes where the octagon can be rotated to have all blue vertices in positions originally occupied by red vertices. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are $2^8 = 256$ possible colorings of the octagon.\n\nTo find the number of favorable outcomes, we need to consider the rotations of the octagon. The octagon has 8-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315 degrees and still look the same. For the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices end up in positions originally occupied by red vertices, the number of blue vertices must be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of 8 and the rotation angle in degrees divided by 45 (since 360/45 = 8).\n\nThe only rotations that can satisfy this condition are 0 degrees (no rotation) and 180 degrees (since 8 and 180/45 = 4 are not coprime, but 8 and 4 share a common factor of 4, which means 2 positions out of 8 are fixed, and the remaining 6 can be paired, but we are looking for the case where all blue vertices end up in red positions, which is more restrictive). For a 180-degree rotation, the octagon must have its vertices colored in an alternating pattern of red and blue to satisfy the condition.\n\nThere are only 2 such alternating patterns (starting with red or starting with blue), but since we are looking for the case where all blue vertices end up in positions originally occupied by red vertices, we need to consider the pattern where the vertices are colored red and blue in an alternating fashion, and there is only one such pattern that satisfies the condition when considering the rotation.\n\nThus, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (one for each alternating pattern, but we need to verify if both are valid in the context of the problem).\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the case of no rotation (0 degrees), which means the octagon must be initially colored in a way that all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices, which is the same as the alternating pattern condition. So, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed 2.\n\nThe probability is then $\\frac{2}{256} = \\frac{1}{128}$.\n\nNext action: [OUTPUT]\n\nThe probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions originally occupied by red vertices is $\\frac{1}{128}$.

We need to express the radius squared as a fraction in simplest form and then find the sum of the numerator and the denominator.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nLet the dimensions of the rectangular box be $a$, $b$, and $c$. The surface area is given by $2(ab + bc + ca) = 54$, and the volume is given by $abc = 23$. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the box, which is the circumradius of the box, given by $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}$.\n\nWe can use the identity $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$ to find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$. From the surface area equation, we have $ab + bc + ca = 27$. Therefore, $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54$, which gives us $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54$.\n\nWe also know that $abc = 23$, and we can use the AM-GM inequality to find a relationship between $a+b+c$ and $abc$. By AM-GM, $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{abc} = \\sqrt[3]{23}$, so $a+b+c \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{23}$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we need to find the minimum value of $(a+b+c)^2$. Since $a+b+c \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{23}$, the minimum value of $(a+b+c)^2$ is $(3\\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 9\\sqrt[3]{529}$.\n\nHowever, we need to verify if this minimum value is achievable and corresponds to the given surface area and volume constraints.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nWe can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a relationship between the sum of the squares and the sum of the products of the dimensions. The inequality states that $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \\geq (a+b+c)^2$, which gives us $3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\geq (a+b+c)^2$. We also know that $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54$.\n\nBy substituting $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54$ into the inequality, we get $3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54$, which simplifies to $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\geq 54$, and therefore $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\geq 27$.\n\nThe radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}$. Therefore, $r^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} \\geq \\frac{27}{4}$.\n\nWe need to verify if the equality case is possible, which occurs when $a = b = c$. However, since $abc = 23$ and $23$ is a prime number, $a = b = c$ is not possible. Therefore, the minimum value of $r^2$ is $\\frac{27}{4}$.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nThe radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is $r^2 = \\frac{27}{4}$.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the current player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nWe can start by identifying the smallest possible values of $n$ and determining whether they are winning or losing positions. We know that $n = 1$ is a winning position for the first player (Alice), since she can take the only token and win. Similarly, $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are also winning positions for Alice, as she can take 1 token, leaving Bob with $n = 1$, which is a winning position for Alice.\n\nHowever, $n = 4$ is a losing position for Alice, as she can only take 1 or 4 tokens, leaving Bob with either $n = 3$ or $n = 0$, both of which are winning positions for Bob.

Assume $D$ is at the origin $(0,0)$, and since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, we can place $E$ at $(x_1, 0)$, $C$ at $(x_2, 0)$, and $F$ at $(x_3, 0)$. Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $A$ is at $(0, 107)$ and $B$ is at $(16, 107)$. Similarly, for rectangle $EFGH$, $G$ is at $(x_1, 184)$ and $H$ is at $(x_2, 184)$.\n\nSince $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle, the distance from the center of the circle to each of these points is the same. Let's find the equation of the circle. The center of the circle can be denoted as $(h, k)$, and the radius is $r$. The equation of the circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.\n\nSince $A(0, 107)$, $D(0, 0)$, $H(x_2, 184)$, and $G(x_1, 184)$ lie on the circle, we can write the following equations:\n\\[\nh^2 + (107 - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 + k^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(x_2 - h)^2 + (184 - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(x_1 - h)^2 + (184 - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $r^2$:\n\\[\n(107 - k)^2 - k^2 = 0\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n11449 - 214k + k^2 - k^2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n11449 - 214k = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nk = \\frac{11449}{214} = 53.5\n\\]\n\nNow that we have $k$, we can find $h$ using the equation $h^2 + k^2 = r^2$ and the fact that $D(0,0)$ lies on the circle:\n\\[\nh^2 + (53.5)^2 = r^2\n\\]\nWe also know that $A(0, 107)$ lies on the circle, so:\n\\[\nh^2 + (107 - 53.5)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 + 53.5^2 = r^2\n\\]\nThis confirms our previous equation. Now, we need to find the coordinates of $E$ and $C$. Since $E$ and $C$ are on the x-axis and $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, we can use the fact that $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles to find the x-coordinates of $E$ and $C$.\n\nThe length of $AD$ is 107, and the length of $GH$ is 184, so the y-coordinate difference between $A$ and $G$ is $184 - 107 = 77$. The x-coordinate difference between $A$ and $G$ is $x_1 - 0 = x_1$. Using the Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle ADG$:\n\\[\nAD^2 + DG^2 = AG^2\n\\]\n\\[\n107^2 + x_1^2 = 77^2 + (x_1 - 0)^2\n\\]\nThis doesn't provide new information, so we need to use the given side lengths of the rectangles. We know $BC = 16$ and $FG = 17$, so the x-coordinate of $C$ is $16$ more than the x-coordinate of $B$, and the x-coordinate of $F$ is $17$ more than the x-coordinate of $G$.\n\nLet's denote the x-coordinate of $E$ as $x_1$ and the x-coordinate of $C$ as $x_2$. Since $E, C, F$ are collinear and $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, we can write:\n\\[\nx_2 - x_1 = BC = 16\n\\]\nWe also know that the length of $EF$ is 184 and the length of $AB$ is 107, so the difference in y-coordinates is 77.

We also know that $x_2 - x_1 = BC = 16$.\n\nSince $A(0,107)$, $D(0,0)$, $H(x_2,184)$, and $G(x_1,184)$ lie on a circle, we can use the fact that the power of a point theorem or the intersecting chords theorem might be useful.\n\nHowever, we can also use the fact that the length of the rectangle $EFGH$ is 17 and the length of the rectangle $ABCD$ is 107. We can set up the equation using the coordinates and the given side lengths.\n\nLet's use the coordinates of $E$ and $C$ to find the length of $CE$.

This is because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and the midpoint of the diagonals is the origin.\n\nThe points $A$ and $C$ are on the hyperbola, so we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\n\\]\nThe length of the diagonal $BD$ is the distance between the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(-y_1, -x_1)$, which is:\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{(x_1 - (-y_1))^2 + (y_1 - (-x_1))^2} = \\sqrt{(x_1 + y_1)^2 + (y_1 + x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{2(x_1^2 + y_1^2 + 2x_1 y_1)}\n\\]\nHowever, since the points are on the hyperbola and the rhombus properties, we can use the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. The length of the diagonal $BD$ can be calculated as:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\n\\]\nWe need to express $y_1^2$ in terms of $x_1^2$ using the hyperbola equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \\implies y_1^2 = \\frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \\frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24\n\\]\nSubstituting $y_1^2$ into the expression for $BD^2$:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + \\frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24) = 4(\\frac{11}{5}x_1^2 - 24) = \\frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96\n\\]\nTo find the minimum value of $BD^2$, we need to find the minimum value of $\\frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96$.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, we can visualize the hexagon as being composed of six equilateral triangles, with each side of the hexagon being the base of one of these triangles.\n\nWhen we extend the sides \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(EF\\), we form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We can relate the side lengths of this triangle to the side length of the hexagon.

Specifically, one of the sides of triangle \\(PQR\\) is equal to \\(s + s = 2s\\), another side is equal to \\(s + s = 2s\\), and the third side is equal to \\(s + s = 2s\\), but these are not the given side lengths. Instead, the given side lengths are the sums of the side lengths of the hexagon and some additional segments.\n\nWe can use the fact that the triangle \\(PQR\\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300 to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the additional segments as \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).

The semi-perimeter \\(s_{PQR}\\) of triangle \\(PQR\\) is:\n\\[s_{PQR} = \\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{2} = 370\\]\n\nUsing Heron's formula, we can find the area of triangle \\(PQR\\), but we can also use the fact that the triangle can be divided into smaller triangles to find the side length of the hexagon.\n\nSince the triangle \\(PQR\\) is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, we can use the fact that the side length of the hexagon is related to the side lengths of the triangle \\(PQR\\). We can set up a proportion or use the properties of the equilateral hexagon to find the side length \\(s\\).\n\nAfter re-evaluating the problem, we can use the fact that the side length of the hexagon is the average of the side lengths of the triangle \\(PQR\\) divided by 2. This is because the triangle \\(PQR\\) is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, and the side length of the hexagon is half the length of the extended sides.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the hexagon is:\n\\[s = \\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{6} = \\frac{740}{6} = \\frac{370}{3}\\]\n\nHowever, we need to verify this result.\n\nNext action: [VERIFY]\n\nWe need to verify that the side length of the hexagon is indeed \\(\\frac{370}{3}\\).

The torus is formed by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the radii of the two circles that are externally tangent to the sphere and the torus. Let's denote the radius of the sphere as $R = 11$, the radius of the torus's tube as $r = 3$, and the distance from the center of the torus's tube to the axis of rotation as $d = 6$.\n\nWhen the torus is on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is $R + r_i$, where $r_i$ is the radius of the circle that the torus is tangent to. This distance is also equal to the sum of the distance from the center of the torus's tube to the axis of rotation and the radius of the torus's tube, i.e., $d + r$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ R + r_i = d + r + r_i \\]\n\\[ R = d + 2r \\]\n\\[ r_i = \\frac{R - d + r}{1} = R - d + r = 11 - 6 + 3 = 8 \\]\n\nWhen the torus is on the inside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is $R - r_o$, where $r_o$ is the radius of the circle that the torus is tangent to. This distance is also equal to the difference between the distance from the center of the torus's tube to the axis of rotation and the radius of the torus's tube, i.e., $d - r$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ R - r_o = d - r + r_o \\]\n\\[ R = d - 2r + 2r_o \\]\n\\[ r_o = \\frac{R - d + r}{2} = \\frac{11 - 6 + 3}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\]\n\nThe difference between the radii is:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = 8 - 4 = 4 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the problem and the calculation of the radii. Let's re-evaluate the problem and calculate the correct radii.\n\nThe correct calculation for the radii involves the use of the Pythagorean theorem. When the torus is on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is $R - r_i$, and this distance forms a right triangle with the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the torus's tube to the axis of rotation. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ (R - r_i)^2 = (d + r)^2 + r^2 \\]\n\\[ (11 - r_i)^2 = (6 + 3)^2 + 3^2 \\]\n\\[ (11 - r_i)^2 = 81 + 9 \\]\n\\[ (11 - r_i)^2 = 90 \\]\n\\[ 11 - r_i = \\sqrt{90} = 3\\sqrt{10} \\]\n\\[ r_i = 11 - 3\\sqrt{10} \\]\n\nWhen the torus is on the inside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is $R + r_o$, and this distance forms a right triangle with the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the torus's tube to the axis of rotation. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ (R + r_o)^2 = (d - r)^2 + r^2 \\]\n\\[ (11 + r_o)^2 = (6 - 3)^2 + 3^2 \\]\n\\[ (11 + r_o)^2 = 9 + 9 \\]\n\\[ (11 + r_o)^2 = 18 \\]\n\\[ 11 + r_o = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\\[ r_o = 3\\sqrt{2} - 11 \\]\n\nThe difference between the radii is:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = (11 - 3\\sqrt{10}) - (3\\sqrt{2} - 11) = 22 - 3\\sqrt{10} - 3\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to find the difference in the form of $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime positive integers.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem and calculate the correct difference.\n\nThe correct difference is:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = \\frac{121 - 90}{11 + 3\\sqrt{10}} - \\frac{121 - 18}{11 - 3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{31}{11 + 3\\sqrt{10}} - \\frac{103}{11 - 3\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = \\frac{31(11 - 3\\sqrt{10}) - 103(11 + 3\\sqrt{2})}{(11 + 3\\sqrt{10})(11 - 3\\sqrt{2})} \\]\n\nHowever, the correct approach is to use the correct formula for the radii.\n\nThe correct radii are:\n\\[ r_i = \\frac{R^2 - d^2 + 2Rr}{2(R + r)} = \\frac{11^2 - 6^2 + 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 3}{2(11 + 3)} = \\frac{121 - 36 + 66}{28} = \\frac{151}{28} \\]\n\\[ r_o = \\frac{R^2 - d^2 - 2Rr}{2(R - r)} = \\frac{11^2 - 6^2 - 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 3}{2(11 - 3)} = \\frac{121 - 36 - 66}{16} = \\frac{19}{16} \\]\n\nThe difference between the radii is:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = \\frac{151}{28} - \\frac{19}{16} = \\frac{151 \\cdot 4 - 19 \\cdot 7}{112} = \\frac{604 - 133}{112} = \\frac{471}{112} \\]\n\nThe sum of the numerator and the denominator is:\n\\[ m + n = 471 + 112 = 583 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\boxed{583}\n\n", "answer": "127"}
