The function $f(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{2}|$ can be broken down as follows:\n- For $|x| < \\frac{1}{2}$, $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} - |x|$.\n- For $|x| \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, $f(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the function $g(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}|$ can be broken down as follows:\n- For $|x| < \\frac{1}{4}$, $g(x) = \\frac{1}{4} - |x|$.\n- For $|x| \\geq \\frac{1}{4}$, $g(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the composite functions $g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$ and $f(\\cos (3 \\pi y))$.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nSince $-1 \\leq \\sin (2 \\pi x) \\leq 1$, we need to determine the range of $f(\\sin (2 \\pi x))$. The function $f(x)$ maps the interval $[-1, 1]$ to the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$. Therefore, $0 \\leq f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, since $-1 \\leq \\cos (3 \\pi y) \\leq 1$, we need to determine the range of $f(\\cos (3 \\pi y))$. The function $f(x)$ maps the interval $[-1, 1]$ to the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$. Therefore, $0 \\leq f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the range of $g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$ and $g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$. Since $0 \\leq f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $0 \\leq f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, we need to evaluate $g(x)$ on the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$. For $0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$, $g(x) = x - \\frac{1}{4}$, and for $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, $g(x) = x - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$ and $g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$ is $[0, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection points of the graphs of $y=4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$ and $x=4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$. Since $0 \\leq g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x))) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$ and $0 \\leq g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y))) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation $4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x))) = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi (4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))))))$. Let's denote $a = g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$ and $b = g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$. Then, we have $y = 4a$ and $x = 4b$. Substituting $y = 4a$ into the equation $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$, we get $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (12 \\pi a)))$.\n\nSince $0 \\leq a \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $0 \\leq 12 \\pi a \\leq 3 \\pi$. The function $\\cos (12 \\pi a)$ will take on all values in the interval $[-1, 1]$ as $a$ varies from $0$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, $f(\\cos (12 \\pi a))$ will take on all values in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, and $g(f(\\cos (12 \\pi a)))$ will take on all values in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\n\nThe equation $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (12 \\pi a)))$ will have a solution for each value of $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$. Since $y = 4a$, the value of $y$ will range from $0$ to $1$.\n\nTo find the number of intersection points, we need to consider the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions. The function $\\sin (2 \\pi x)$ has a period of $1$, and the function $\\cos (3 \\pi y)$ has a period of $\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, we need to consider the interval $[0, 1]$ for $x$ and the interval $[0, 1]$ for $y$.\n\nBy symmetry and periodicity, we can conclude that the number of intersection points is the product of the number of periods of the sine and cosine functions within the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nThe function $\\sin (2 \\pi x)$ completes 1 period in the interval $[0, 1]$, and the function $\\cos (3 \\pi y)$ completes $\\frac{3}{2}$ periods in the interval $[0, 1]$.

The path can only move right or up.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of moves required to reach the top-right corner from the bottom-left corner. Since the grid is $8 \\times 8$, we need to make a total of 16 moves, consisting of 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up.\n\n changing direction exactly four times means that we have 5 segments of moves in total (since the first segment is after the first change, the second segment is between the first and second change, and so on). We can represent the path as a sequence of R's (right) and U's (up), where the direction changes correspond to the transition from R to U or U to R.\n\nWe can think of this problem as arranging 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence such that there are exactly 4 changes from R to U or U to R. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (between the 16 moves) to place the direction changes.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the sequence starts with either R or U and ends with the opposite direction. This means we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the R's and U's such that the sequence starts and ends with different directions.\n\nNext, we can use the concept of lattice paths and combinatorics to find the number of such paths. We need to count the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's with exactly 4 direction changes.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 for the direction changes is given by $\\binom{15}{4}$. However, we need to ensure that the sequence starts and ends with different directions. We can do this by considering the number of ways to arrange the R's and U's in the segments created by the direction changes.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we can use the formula for the number of lattice paths with a given number of direction changes. The number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(8,8)$ with exactly 4 direction changes is given by $\\binom{8}{4}^2$.\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70\n\\]\nSo, the number of paths is:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{4}^2 = 70^2 = 4900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is $\\boxed{4900}$.\n\n", "answer": "294"}

The torus is formed by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis 6 units from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11. We need to find the radii of the circles that are tangent to the sphere and the torus, and then calculate the difference between these radii.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus can be visualized as a doughnut-shaped object with a major radius of 6 (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and a minor radius of 3 (radius of the tube). The sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nWhen the torus is placed on the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8 (since the radius of the torus is 3). The distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the torus touches the sphere is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the torus, which is 11 + 3 = 14.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle that is tangent to the sphere and the torus. Let's denote the radius of the inner tangent circle as $r_i$ and the radius of the outer tangent circle as $r_o$.\n\nFor the inner tangent circle, we have a right triangle with legs of length $r_i$ and 8, and a hypotenuse of length 11 - $r_i$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\[ r_i^2 + 8^2 = (11 - r_i)^2 \\]\n\\[ r_i^2 + 64 = 121 - 22r_i + r_i^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 = 121 - 22r_i \\]\n\\[ 22r_i = 57 \\]\n\\[ r_i = \\frac{57}{22} \\]\n\nFor the outer tangent circle, we have a right triangle with legs of length $r_o$ and 8, and a hypotenuse of length 11 + $r_o$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\[ r_o^2 + 8^2 = (11 + r_o)^2 \\]\n\\[ r_o^2 + 64 = 121 + 22r_o + r_o^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 = 121 + 22r_o \\]\n\\[ 22r_o = -57 \\]\n\\[ r_o = -\\frac{57}{22} \\]\nSince the radius cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\\[ r_o = \\frac{57}{22} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to re-evaluate the calculation for $r_o$ as the correct approach should consider the correct geometry. Let's re-calculate $r_o$ by considering the correct right triangle.\n\nThe correct right triangle for the outer tangent circle has legs of length $r_o$ and 8, and a hypotenuse of length 11 + $r_o$. However, the correct equation should be:\n\\[ (11 + r_o)^2 = r_o^2 + 8^2 + (3 + r_o)^2 \\]\nBut a simpler approach is to use the similar triangles or the correct geometric relationship.\n\nLet's use the correct geometric relationship:\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8. The distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the torus touches the sphere is 14. The radius of the sphere is 11. The correct calculation for $r_o$ is:\n\\[ r_o = \\frac{11 \\cdot 3}{11 - 3} = \\frac{33}{8} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the radii:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = \\frac{57}{22} - \\frac{33}{8} \\]\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 88:\n\\[ r_i - r_o = \\frac{57 \\cdot 4}{22 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{33 \\cdot 11}{8 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{228}{88} - \\frac{363}{88} = \\frac{228 - 363}{88} = \\frac{-135}{88} \\]\nSince we are asked for the absolute value of the difference:\n\\[ |r_i - r_o| = \\left| \\frac{-135}{88} \\right| = \\frac{135}{88} \\]\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator:\n\\[ m + n = 135 + 88 = 223 \\]\n\nNext action: [OUTPUT]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{223}$\n\n", "answer": "127"}

We can think of this as selecting a subset of rows to be one color and a subset of columns to be the other color.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to choose the rows and columns for each color. We can choose $k$ rows out of 5 to be one color (say white) and $l$ columns out of 5 to be the other color (say black). The number of ways to choose $k$ rows out of 5 is $\\binom{5}{k}$, and the number of ways to choose $l$ columns out of 5 is $\\binom{5}{l}$.\n\nFor each choice of rows and columns, we have two options: either the chosen rows are white and the chosen columns are black, or vice versa. However, we must also consider the case where all rows or all columns are the same color, which would be counted multiple times.\n\nThe total number of valid configurations can be calculated by summing over all possible choices of rows and columns, considering the two color options for each choice.\n\nNext action: [ADVANCE]\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nThe total number of valid configurations can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\sum_{l=0}^{5} 2 \\binom{5}{k} \\binom{5}{l} - \\sum_{k=0}^{5} 2 \\binom{5}{k} + \\sum_{l=0}^{5} 2 \\binom{5}{l} - 2\n\\]\n\nThe first term counts the number of ways to choose $k$ rows and $l$ columns, with a factor of 2 to account for the two color options. The second and third terms subtract the overcounted cases where all rows or all columns are the same color, respectively. The final term adds back the case where the entire grid is the same color, which was subtracted twice.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n2 \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\sum_{l=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} \\binom{5}{l} - 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} - 2 \\sum_{l=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{l} + 2\n\\]\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, we know that $\\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} = 2^5 = 32$. Also, $\\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\sum_{l=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} \\binom{5}{l} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{l=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{l} \\right) = 32 \\cdot 32 = 1024$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 1024 - 2 \\cdot 32 - 2 \\cdot 32 + 2 = 2048 - 64 - 64 + 2 = 1922\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the problem asks for the number of ways to place some of the bricks, which means we should include the case where no bricks are placed. This case is already included in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid configurations is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1922}\n\\]\n\n", "answer": "902"}
