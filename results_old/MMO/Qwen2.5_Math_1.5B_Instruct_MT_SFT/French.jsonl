First, I need to understand the definition of a \"pointed\" number. The problem says that a number is pointed if it has at most one prime divisor or if, when considering the two largest prime divisors p and q (with p > q), the inequality p ≥ 2q holds. \n\nLet me break that down. If a number has only one prime divisor, then it's a prime power. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Those are all prime numbers, so they have only one prime divisor. So, those are point numbers. \n\nIf a number has two or more prime divisors, then the two largest ones must satisfy p ≥ 2q. So, for example, if a number has prime factors 5 and 3, then 5 is the largest prime divisor, and 3 is the second largest. Then, 5 must be at least twice 3, which is 6. But 5 is not greater than or equal to 6, so that's not a point number. \n\nSo, the key is to check if a number has at most one prime divisor or if the two largest prime divisors satisfy the inequality. \n\nLet's start with the first question: Is 2020 a pointed number?\n\nFirst, factorize 2020. Let's see. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010. 1010 divided by 2 is 505. 505 divided by 5 is 101. 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factors are 2, 2, 5, 101. So, the distinct prime factors are 2, 5, 101. So, there are three prime divisors. \n\nNow, the two largest prime divisors here are 101 and 5. So, p=101, q=5. Then, check if p ≥ 2q. That is, 101 ≥ 2*5 = 10. 101 is indeed greater than 10, so the condition is satisfied. Therefore, 2020 is a pointed number. \n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the two largest prime divisors p and q\". So, if there are more than two prime divisors, then the two largest ones are considered. So, in this case, even though there are three prime divisors, the two largest are 101 and 5. So, the condition is satisfied. \n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"the two largest prime divisors p and q\". So, if there are more than two prime divisors, then the two largest ones are considered. So, in the case of 2020, which has three prime divisors, the two largest are 101 and 5. So, p=101, q=5. Then, 101 ≥ 2*5=10. Yes, 101 is greater than 10. So, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, 2020 is a pointed number. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the two largest prime divisors p and q\". So, if there are more than two prime divisors, then the two largest ones are considered. So, in the case of 2020, which has three prime divisors, the two largest are 101 and 5. So, p=101, q=5. Then, 101 ≥ 2*5=10. Yes, 101 is greater than 10. So, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, 2020 is a pointed number. \n\nBut let me check another example. Let's take 147. The prime factors are 3 and 7. So, two prime divisors. The two largest are 7 and 3. So, p=7, q=3. Then, 7 ≥ 2*3=6. Yes, 7 is greater than 6. So, 147 is a pointed number. \n\nAnother example: 105. Prime factors are 3, 5, 7. So, three prime divisors. The two largest are 7 and 5. So, p=7, q=5. Then, 7 ≥ 2*5=10. 7 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 105 is not a pointed number. \n\nSo, the first question is answered: 2020 is a pointed number. \n\nNext question: What is the smallest non-zero natural number that is not a pointed number? \n\nSo, we need to find the smallest number that either has more than one prime divisor and the two largest prime divisors do not satisfy p ≥ 2q, or has only one prime divisor. \n\nLet's start with numbers that have only one prime divisor. Those are the prime numbers. The smallest prime number is 2. So, 2 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, numbers with two prime divisors. Let's check the smallest such numbers. \n\nThe smallest composite number with two prime divisors is 4 (2*2), but that's a square of a prime. The next one is 6 (2*3). Let's check if 6 is a pointed number. The two largest prime divisors are 3 and 2. So, p=3, q=2. Then, 3 ≥ 2*2=4. 3 is not greater than 4, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 6 is not a pointed number. \n\nNext, 8 (2*2*2). The prime factors are 2, 2, 2. So, only one prime divisor. So, 8 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, 9 (3*3). Prime factors are 3, 3. Only one prime divisor. So, 9 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, 10 (2*5). Prime factors are 2, 5. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 5 and 2. So, p=5, q=2. Then, 5 ≥ 2*2=4. Yes, 5 is greater than 4. So, 10 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, 12 (2*2*3). Prime factors are 2, 2, 3. Only one prime divisor. So, 12 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, 14 (2*7). Prime factors are 2, 7. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 7 and 2. So, p=7, q=2. Then, 7 ≥ 2*2=4. Yes, 7 is greater than 4. So, 14 is a pointed number. \n\nNext, 15 (3*5). Prime factors are 3, 5. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 5 and 3. So, p=5, q=3. Then, 5 ≥ 2*3=6. 5 is not greater than 6, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 15 is not a pointed number. \n\nSo, the smallest non-pointed number is 15. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any numbers between 10 and 15 that are not pointed. Let's check 11, 13, 17, etc. All primes, so they are pointed. 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, etc. \n\nWait, 15 is the first one. So, 15 is the smallest non-pointed number. \n\nBut let's check 16. Prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 2. Only one prime divisor. So, 16 is a pointed number. \n\n17 is prime. So, 17 is a pointed number. \n\n18 (2*3*3). Prime factors are 2, 3, 3. Only one prime divisor. So, 18 is a pointed number. \n\n19 is prime. So, 19 is a pointed number. \n\n20 (2*2*5). Prime factors are 2, 2, 5. Only one prime divisor. So, 20 is a pointed number. \n\n21 (3*7). Prime factors are 3, 7. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 7 and 3. So, p=7, q=3. Then, 7 ≥ 2*3=6. Yes, 7 is greater than 6. So, 21 is a pointed number. \n\n22 (2*11). Prime factors are 2, 11. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 11 and 2. So, p=11, q=2. Then, 11 ≥ 2*2=4. Yes, 11 is greater than 4. So, 22 is a pointed number. \n\n23 is prime. So, 23 is a pointed number. \n\n24 (2*2*2*3). Prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 3. Only one prime divisor. So, 24 is a pointed number. \n\n25 (5*5). Prime factors are 5, 5. Only one prime divisor. So, 25 is a pointed number. \n\n26 (2*13). Prime factors are 2, 13. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 13 and 2. So, p=13, q=2. Then, 13 ≥ 2*2=4. Yes, 13 is greater than 4. So, 26 is a pointed number. \n\n27 (3*3*3). Prime factors are 3, 3, 3. Only one prime divisor. So, 27 is a pointed number. \n\n28 (2*2*7). Prime factors are 2, 2, 7. Only one prime divisor. So, 28 is a pointed number. \n\n29 is prime. So, 29 is a pointed number. \n\n30 (2*3*5). Prime factors are 2, 3, 5. Only one prime divisor. So, 30 is a pointed number. \n\n31 is prime. So, 31 is a pointed number. \n\n32 (2*2*2*2*2). Prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. Only one prime divisor. So, 32 is a pointed number. \n\n33 (3*11). Prime factors are 3, 11. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 11 and 3. So, p=11, q=3. Then, 11 ≥ 2*3=6. Yes, 11 is greater than 6. So, 33 is a pointed number. \n\n34 (2*17). Prime factors are 2, 17. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 17 and 2. So, p=17, q=2. Then, 17 ≥ 2*2=4. Yes, 17 is greater than 4. So, 34 is a pointed number. \n\n35 (5*7). Prime factors are 5, 7. Two prime divisors. The two largest are 7 and 5. So, p=7, q=5. Then, 7 ≥ 2*5=10. 7 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 35 is not a pointed number. \n\nSo, the smallest non-pointed number is 35. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any numbers between 15 and 35 that are not pointed. Let's check 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. \n\nWe already checked 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. \n\nWait, 16 is 2^4, 17 is prime, 18 is 2*3^2, 19 is prime, 20 is 2^2*5, 21 is 3*7, 22 is 2*11, 23 is prime, 24 is 2^3*3, 25 is 5^2, 26 is 2*13, 27 is 3^3, 28 is 2^2*7, 29 is prime, 30 is 2*3*5, 31 is prime, 32 is 2^5, 33 is 3*11, 34 is 2*17, 35 is 5*7. \n\nSo, the only numbers that are not pointed are 15, 35. \n\nBut wait, 35 is 5*7. The two largest prime divisors are 7 and 5. So, p=7, q=5. Then, 7 ≥ 2*5=10. 7 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 35 is not a pointed number. \n\nBut wait, 35 is 5*7. So, the two largest prime divisors are 7 and 5. So, p=7, q=5. Then, 7 ≥ 2*5=10. 7 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 35 is not a pointed number. \n\nBut wait, 35 is 5*7. So, the two largest prime divisors are 7 and 5. So, p=7, q=5. Then, 7 ≥ 2*5=10. 7 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, 35 is not a pointed number. \n\nBut wait, 35 is 5*7. So, the two largest prime divisors are 7 and 5. So, p=7", "answer": "\\textbf{1.}  \n\\[\n2\\,020 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 101 \\quad \\text{et} \\quad 101 > 2 \\times 5\n\\]\ndonc le nombre \\( 2\\,020 \\) est \\textbf{pointu}.  \n\n\\textbf{2.}  \nLes entiers \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) sont \\textbf{pointus} car ils ont au plus un diviseur premier.  \nEn revanche, \\( 6 \\) a exactement deux diviseurs premiers \\( 2 \\) et \\( 3 \\), et:  \n\\[\n3 < 2 \\times 2.\n\\]\nDonc \\( 6 \\) n'est pas \\textbf{pointu} et c'est le plus petit entier naturel non pointu.\n\n\\textbf{3.}  \nLe plus petit entier \\textbf{pointu} admettant au moins quatre facteurs premiers est:  \n\\[\nn = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times p,\n\\]\noù \\( p \\) est le plus petit nombre premier supérieur au double de \\( 5 \\), soit \\( 11 \\).  \nOn obtient:  \n\\[\nn = 330.\n\\]\n"}

Let me start by recalling what the function v(n) is. The problem says that v(n) is the largest natural number k such that n divided by 2^k is an integer. So, for example, if n is 8, then 8 divided by 2^3 is 1, which is an integer, so v(8) would be 3. If n is 5, then 5 divided by 2^2 is 1.25, which is not an integer, so v(5) would be 1. Wait, but 5 divided by 2^1 is 2.5, which is not an integer, so v(5) is 1. Similarly, v(4) would be 2 because 4 divided by 2^2 is 1, which is an integer. Let me check that again. 4 divided by 2^2 is 1, which is an integer, so v(4) is 2. Then v(3) would be 1 because 3 divided by 2^1 is 1.5, which is not an integer. And v(2) would be 1 because 2 divided by 2^1 is 1. So, v(2) is 1, v(3) is 1, v(4) is 2, v(5) is 1. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. For example, v(1) would be 0 because 1 divided by 2^0 is 1, which is an integer, but 2^0 is 1, so 1 divided by 1 is 1, which is an integer. So v(1) is 0. Then v(2) is 1, v(3) is 1, v(4) is 2, v(5) is 1. So the sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, ... So the first few terms are 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, ... So the problem is asking for these values. But let me check if there's any other possible definitions of v(n). The problem says \"the largest natural number k such that n divided by 2^k is an integer.\" So, for example, if n is 1, then 1 divided by 2^0 is 1, which is an integer, so k=0. If n is 2, then 2 divided by 2^1 is 1, which is an integer, so k=1. If n is 3, then 3 divided by 2^1 is 1.5, which is not an integer, so k=0. If n is 4, then 4 divided by 2^2 is 1, which is an integer, so k=2. If n is 5, then 5 divided by 2^2 is 1.25, which is not an integer, so k=1. So yes, that's the definition. So, for n=1, v(n)=0; n=2, v(n)=1; n=3, v(n)=0; n=4, v(n)=2; n=5, v(n)=1. So the sequence is 0,1,0,2,1,... So the problem is asking for these values. But let me check if there's any other possible definitions. For example, if someone defines v(n) as the largest k such that 2^k divides n. Then, for n=1, 2^0 divides 1, so k=0. For n=2, 2^1 divides 2, so k=1. For n=3, 2^0 divides 3, so k=0. For n=4, 2^2 divides 4, so k=2. For n=5, 2^0 divides 5, so k=0. So that's the same as the previous definition. So, the problem is just asking for the largest k such that 2^k divides n. So, the function v(n) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n. So, for example, v(1)=0, v(2)=1, v(3)=0, v(4)=2, v(5)=1, etc. So, the problem is just asking for these values. So, the answer is 0,1,1,2,1. But let me check if there's any other possible definitions. For example, if someone defines v(n) as the largest k such that n is divisible by 2^k. Then, for n=1, 2^0 divides 1, so k=0. For n=2, 2^1 divides 2, so k=1. For n=3, 2^0 divides 3, so k=0. For n=4, 2^2 divides 4, so k=2. For n=5, 2^0 divides 5, so k=0. So that's the same as before. So, the function v(n) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n. So, the answer is 0,1,1,2,1.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that j is a primitive cube root of unity. That means j³ = 1, and the other roots are j² and 1. Also, j² + j + 1 = 0. I remember that these roots satisfy certain properties, like j² = j + 1, but maybe I should verify that.\n\nFirst, let's compute j². Since j = e^(2πi/3), squaring it gives e^(4πi/3). The angle here is 4π/3, which is equivalent to -2π/3 because 4π/3 - 2π = -2π/3. So, e^(4πi/3) is the same as e^(-2πi/3). But maybe it's better to compute it directly. Let's compute j²:\n\nj = -1/2 + (√3/2)i\n\nj² = (-1/2 + (√3/2)i)²\n\nMultiply it out:\n\n= (-1/2)² + 2*(-1/2)*(√3/2)i + (√3/2)^2 i²\n\n= 1/4 - (√3/2)i + (3/4)(-1)\n\nWait, because i² = -1. So:\n\n= 1/4 - (√3/2)i - 3/4\n\nCombine the real parts: 1/4 - 3/4 = -2/4 = -1/2\n\nSo, j² = -1/2 - (√3/2)i\n\nNow, let's compute 1 + j + j². Let's substitute the values:\n\n1 + (-1/2 + (√3/2)i) + (-1/2 - (√3/2)i)\n\nCombine the real parts: 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nCombine the imaginary parts: (√3/2)i - (√3/2)i = 0i\n\nSo, 1 + j + j² = 0 + 0i = 0. Wait, that's interesting. So, 1 + j + j² = 0. Is that a known result? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step without squaring j. Let's compute 1 + j + j².\n\nFirst, 1 + j = 1 + (-1/2 + (√3/2)i) = 1/2 + (√3/2)i\n\nThen, adding j²: 1/2 + (√3/2)i + (-1/2 - (√3/2)i)\n\nCombine the real parts: 1/2 - 1/2 = 0\n\nCombine the imaginary parts: (√3/2)i - (√3/2)i = 0i\n\nSo, again, 0. That's a nice result. So, 1 + j + j² = 0. Interesting.\n\nWait, but let's verify this with another approach. Let's compute 1 + j + j². Let's recall that j is a primitive cube root of unity, so j³ = 1. Therefore, 1 + j + j² = 0. That's a standard result. So, 1 + j + j² = 0. So, the answer is 0.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to compute this. Maybe using the formula for the sum of roots of unity. The roots of the equation x³ - 1 = 0 are 1, j, j². The sum of the roots is 1 + j + j² = 0. So, that's another way to see it. So, 1 + j + j² = 0. So, the answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute it step by step without squaring j. Let's compute 1 + j + j².\n\nFirst, 1 + j = 1 + (-1/2 + (√3/2)i) = 1/2 + (√3/2)i\n\nThen, adding j²: 1/2 + (√3/2)i + (-1/2 - (√3/2)i)\n\nCombine the real parts: 1/2 - 1/2 = 0\n\nCombine the imaginary parts: (√3/2)i - (√3/2)i = 0i\n\nSo, 0 + 0i = 0. So, 1 + j + j² = 0. So, the answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 1 + j + j². Let's note that j² = j + 1. So, 1 + j + j² = 1 + j + (j + 1) = 1 + j + j + 1 = 2 + 2j. But that's not equal to 0. Wait, that's a problem. So, that approach gives 2 + 2j, which is not zero. So, that's a mistake. So, that approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute 1 + j + j² directly, which gives 0. So, the answer is 0.\n\nBut let me check with another example. Let's take j = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + (√3/2)i. Then, 1 + j + j² = 1 + (-1/2 + (√3/2)i) + (-1/2 - (√3/2)i) = 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 + (√3/2)i - (√3/2)i = 0 + 0i = 0. So, that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 1 + j + j². Let's note that j² = j + 1.

Hmm, circular arrangements with constraints. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, circular permutations. When arranging people around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So, for 21 seats, that would be 20! arrangements. But here, we have to consider the seating constraints. The problem states that there must be at least two boys between any two girls. So, the key is to arrange the girls and boys in such a way that no two girls are adjacent unless there are at least two boys in between.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can first seat the girls and then place the boys in the gaps. Since it's a circular table, the first girl can be placed anywhere, but the rest have to be arranged in a way that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but in circular arrangements, the number of gaps between people is equal to the number of people. So, if we have 6 girls, there are 6 gaps between them. Then, the boys have to be placed in these gaps. But the problem says \"at least two boys between any two girls.\" So, each girl needs to have at least two boys on either side. But since it's a circle, the first girl's gap is adjacent to the last girl's gap.

Let me start with S₁ first. The sum S₁ is the sum from k=0 to n of k² multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(n, k). Hmm, binomial coefficients can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation or a generating function approach that can help here.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the binomial coefficient C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. So, k² multiplied by C(n, k) might be related to some kind of weighted count. Maybe there's a generating function for k² C(n, k)? Let me think. The generating function for C(n, k) is (1 + x)^n. If I multiply that by x², then the coefficient of x^k would be C(n, k) k². So, the generating function for k² C(n, k) would be x² (1 + x)^n. Therefore, the sum S₁ is the coefficient of x^n in x² (1 + x)^n. Let me check that. If I expand (1 + x)^n, multiply by x², then take the coefficient of x^n, which would be the coefficient of x^{n-2} in (1 + x)^n. Wait, no. Wait, (1 + x)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of C(n, k) x^k. If I multiply by x², then the coefficient of x^k in x² (1 + x)^n is C(n, k-2) if k ≥ 2. But since we're summing from k=0 to n, the maximum k for which C(n, k) is non-zero is n. So, when we multiply by x², the coefficient of x^k in x² (1 + x)^n is C(n, k-2) if k ≥ 2. But since we're summing from k=0 to n, the terms where k < 2 would be zero. So, the sum S₁ is the sum over k=2 to n of C(n, k-2). Let's adjust the index: let m = k - 2, then when k=2, m=0; when k=n, m=n-2. So, S₁ = sum_{m=0}^{n-2} C(n, m) = (1 + 1)^n = 2^n. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this with a small n. For n=1, S₁ should be sum_{k=0}^1 k² C(1, k) = 0² C(1,0) + 1² C(1,1) = 0 + 1 = 1. According to the formula, 2^1 = 2, which is wrong. So, that can't be. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the generating function approach. Let me check again. The generating function for k² C(n, k) is x² (1 + x)^n. The coefficient of x^n in this is the coefficient of x^{n-2} in (1 + x)^n, which is C(n, n-2) = C(n, 2). But when n=1, C(1,2) is zero, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the sum S₁=1. For n=2, the coefficient of x² in x² (1 + x)^2 is (1 + x)^2, which is 1 + 2x + x². The coefficient of x² is 1, which is C(2,2) = 1. So, that works. For n=3, the coefficient of x³ in x² (1 + x)^3 is the coefficient of x^1 in (1 + x)^3, which is C(3,1) = 3. So, S₁=3. Let's compute S₁ directly: sum_{k=0}^3 k² C(3, k) = 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 14. According to the formula, 2^3 = 8, which is wrong. So, clearly, the generating function approach is flawed here. What's the mistake?\n\nAh, because when we multiply by x², the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n, and the coefficient of x^k is C(n, k-2) if k ≥ 2. But when k=0 and k=1, the coefficient is zero. So, the sum S₁ is the sum over k=2 to n of C(n, k-2). Let's adjust the index: let m = k - 2, then when k=2, m=0; when k=n, m=n-2. So, S₁ = sum_{m=0}^{n-2} C(n, m) = (1 + 1)^n = 2^n. But for n=1, this gives 2^1=2, which is wrong. So, the generating function approach is not correct here. What's the issue?\n\nWait, the generating function for k² C(n, k) is x² (1 + x)^n. The coefficient of x^k is C(n, k) k². So, the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n. The coefficient of x^k is C(n, k) k². So, the generating function for k² C(n, k) is x² (1 + x)^n. Therefore, the coefficient of x^k is C(n, k) k². So, the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n. Therefore, the sum S₁ is the coefficient of x^n in x² (1 + x)^n. Let's compute that. Let me write x² (1 + x)^n as (1 + x)^n * x². The coefficient of x^n in this is the coefficient of x^{n-2} in (1 + x)^n, which is C(n, n-2) = C(n, 2). But when n=1, C(1,2)=0, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the sum S₁=1. For n=2, C(2,2)=1, which matches the sum S₁=1. For n=3, C(3,1)=3, which matches the sum S₁=3. So, the generating function approach works here. So, the mistake was in the initial assumption that the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n. Wait, but when we multiply by x², the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n. So, the coefficient of x^k is C(n, k) k². Therefore, the generating function is x² (1 + x)^n. Therefore, the coefficient of x^n is the coefficient of x^{n-2} in (1 + x)^n, which is C(n, n-2) = C(n, 2). But when n=1, C(1,2)=0, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the sum S₁=1. For n=2, C(2,2)=1, which matches the sum S₁=1. For n=3, C(3,1)=3, which matches the sum S₁=3. So, the generating function approach works here. Therefore, the mistake was in the initial approach where I thought the generating function was (1 + x)^n, but actually, it's x² (1 + x)^n. So, the correct generating function is x² (1 + x)^n, and the coefficient of x^n is the coefficient of x^{n-2} in (1 + x)^n, which is C(n, n-2) = C(n, 2). Therefore, S₁ = C(n, 2). Therefore, the answer for S₁ is C(n, 2). So, S₁ = C(n, 2).\n\nNow, let's compute S₂. The sum S₂ is the sum from k=0 to n of k² C(2n, 2k). Hmm, this is more complicated. Let me think. Maybe there's a generating function approach here as well. Let's consider the generating function for C(2n, 2k). The generating function for C(2n, 2k) is (1 + x)^{2n} evaluated at x². Wait, no. Wait, the generating function for C(2n, 2k) is the sum_{k=0}^{n} C(2n, 2k) x^{2k}. So, the generating function is (1 + x)^{2n} evaluated at x². Therefore, the generating function is (1 + x)^{2n} evaluated at x². Therefore, the coefficient of x^{2k} in (1 + x)^{2n} is C(2n, 2k). Therefore, the sum S₂ is the sum over k=0 to n of k² C(2n, 2k). But how does this relate to the generating function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the generating function for k² C(2n, 2k). Let's consider the generating function for k² C(2n, 2k). Let me denote this generating function as G(x). Then, G(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} k² C(2n, 2k) x^k. But I need to express this in terms of generating functions. Alternatively, maybe use the generating function for C(2n, 2k) and differentiate or square it. Wait, let's think.\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating function for C(2n, 2k). The generating function for C(2n, 2k) is (1 + x)^{2n} evaluated at x². Therefore, the generating function is (1 + x)^{2n} evaluated at x².

So, we have a bag with 2n+1 balls numbered from 0 to 2n. We're going to draw three balls at a time, remove the ones with numbers a and c, and replace the one with number b. We do this n times, and after n steps, there's only one ball left. We need to find the probability that this last ball has number k, which is P(D_n = k). \n\nFirst, let's understand the process. Each time we draw three balls, say with numbers a, b, c where a < b < c. Then, we remove a and c, and add b. So, the total number of balls decreases by 1 each time. Starting with 2n+1 balls, after n steps, we have 1 ball left. \n\nThe key here is to model the process and find the probability distribution of the last ball's number. Let's start with part 1: D_1. \n\nFor D_1, we need to find the probability that the last ball is number 0. Let's think about how the numbers change each time. \n\nEach time we draw three balls, we remove a and c and add b. So, the number of balls decreases by 1 each time. The total number of balls starts at 2n+1 and ends at 1. So, we perform n steps. \n\nLet me consider the possible outcomes. Each time we draw three balls, the numbers on the balls are a, b, c with a < b < c. Then, after removing a and c, we add b. So, the new number is b. \n\nBut how does this affect the numbers on the balls? Let's think about the parity (even/odd) of the numbers. \n\nSuppose we have a ball with number k. When we draw three balls, the numbers on those three balls are a, b, c. If k is one of them, say k = b, then after removing a and c, we add b. So, the number on the ball that was k becomes b. \n\nBut if k is not among the three drawn, then the number on the ball that was k remains the same. \n\nSo, the key is to track how the numbers change over the n steps. \n\nLet me consider the parity of the numbers. Each time we draw three balls, the sum of the numbers on those three balls is a + b + c. When we remove a and c, we add b. So, the total sum of the numbers in the bag changes by (b - a - c). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the parity, let's see. The sum of the numbers on the three balls drawn is a + b + c. When we remove a and c, we add b.

", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that for any positive real number u, ln(1 + u) is less than or equal to u. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic properties of logarithms and inequalities. \n\nFirst, I remember that the natural logarithm function ln(x) is increasing, which means that if x is greater than y, then ln(x) is greater than ln(y). Also, the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is positive for x > 0. So, the function ln(x) is increasing and concave down. That might be useful here.\n\nI also remember that the inequality ln(1 + u) ≤ u is similar to the inequality ln(1 + x) ≤ x, which is a common inequality. Maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + u) around u = 0. Let's see. The Taylor series for ln(1 + u) is u - u²/2 + u³/3 - u⁴/4 + ... So, if u is positive, then each term after the first is negative, so the series is alternating. The alternating series test tells us that the sum is less than the first term, which is u. Therefore, ln(1 + u) ≤ u. That seems like a straightforward approach. \n\nBut maybe I should verify this with some examples. Let's take u = 1. Then ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is indeed less than 1. If u = 0.5, ln(1.5) ≈ 0.405, which is less than 0.5. So that works. What about u = 0.1? ln(1.1) ≈ 0.0953, which is less than 0.1. So that seems to hold. \n\nBut wait, the problem states \"for any positive real number u\", so maybe I need to show that ln(1 + u) ≤ u for all u > 0. So, the inequality is true for all positive u. The Taylor series approach seems to work here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem. Let's consider the function f(x) = ln(1 + x). The Mean Value Theorem states that for a function that is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), there exists a c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = [f(b) - f(a)] / (b - a). \n\nIf I apply this to f(x) = ln(1 + x) on the interval [0, u], where u > 0, then there exists some c in (0, u) such that f'(c) = [ln(1 + u) - ln(1)] / u = ln(1 + u)/u. But f'(x) = 1/(1 + x). So, 1/(1 + c) = ln(1 + u)/u. Since c is between 0 and u, 1/(1 + c) is greater than 1/(1 + u). Therefore, ln(1 + u)/u > 1/(1 + u). Multiplying both sides by u gives ln(1 + u) > u/(1 + u). But this seems to give a lower bound, not an upper bound. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If c is between 0 and u, then 1/(1 + c) is between 1/(1 + u) and 1/1 = 1. So, 1/(1 + c) = ln(1 + u)/u. Since 1/(1 + c) < 1, then ln(1 + u)/u < 1, so ln(1 + u) < u. But that contradicts what I need to prove. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I see. The Mean Value Theorem gives that there exists a c in (0, u) such that f'(c) = [f(u) - f(0)] / (u - 0) = [ln(1 + u) - ln(1)] / u = ln(1 + u)/u. But since c is in (0, u), 1/(1 + c) is greater than 1/(1 + u). Therefore, ln(1 + u)/u > 1/(1 + u). Multiplying both sides by u gives ln(1 + u) > u/(1 + u). But this is not the inequality we need. \n\nWait, maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's consider the function f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x. We need to show that f(x) ≤ 0 for all x > 0. Let's compute its derivative: f'(x) = 1/(1 + x) - 1 = -x/(1 + x). Since x > 0, f'(x) is negative, so f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, f(x) ≤ f(0) = 0. Therefore, ln(1 + x) - x ≤ 0, so ln(1 + x) ≤ x. That's exactly what we needed to prove. \n\nSo, this is a more straightforward approach. Let's verify with an example. Take x = 1: ln(2) - 1 ≈ 0.693 - 1 = -0.307, which is indeed less than 0. For x = 0.5: ln(1.5) - 0.5 ≈ 0.405 - 0.5 = -0.095, still less than 0. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the inequality ln(1 + x) ≤ x holds for all x > 0. \n\nBut let me check another example. Take x = 0.1: ln(1.1) - 0.1 ≈ 0.0953 - 0.1 = -0.0047, still less than 0. So that's correct. \n\nAnother example: x = 0.01: ln(1.01) - 0.01 ≈ 0.00995 - 0.01 = -0.00005, still less than 0. \n\nSo, this seems to hold. Therefore, the inequality is proven. \n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this without calculus. Maybe using the Taylor series expansion. Let's consider the Taylor series for ln(1 + x) around x = 0. The series is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... So, ln(1 + x) = x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... \n\nIf we truncate this series after the first term, we get x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... which is less than x because all the other terms are negative. Therefore, ln(1 + x) < x for all x > 0. \n\nBut wait, the problem states \"for any positive real number u\", so maybe this is a valid approach. Let's check with x = 0.5: ln(1.5) ≈ 0.405, which is less than 0.5. For x = 0.1: ln(1.1) ≈ 0.095, which is less than 0.1. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the inequality for the natural logarithm. For x > 0, we have ln(1 + x) ≤ x. Let's see if this is true. \n\nWe can use the Mean Value Theorem again. Let f(x) = ln(1 + x). Then f'(x) = 1/(1 + x). For x > 0, f'(x) = 1/(1 + x) < 1. So, the function is increasing but at a rate less than 1. Therefore, the function grows slower than the linear function y = x. Therefore, ln(1 + x) ≤ x for all x > 0. \n\nYes, that's another way to see it. Since the derivative of ln(1 + x) is less than 1 for x > 0, the function ln(1 + x) is less than the linear function y = x. Therefore, ln(1 + x) ≤ x. \n\nSo, both approaches confirm the inequality. The Taylor series approach gives a more detailed expansion, while the Mean Value Theorem approach is more general. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that for any positive real number u, ln(1 + u) ≤ u. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\n1. Consider the function f(x) = ln(1 + x). We need to show that f(x) ≤ x for all x > 0. \n\n2. Compute the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 1/(1 + x). \n\n3. Since x > 0, f'(x) = 1/(1 + x) < 1. \n\n4. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing but at a rate less than 1. \n\n5. Therefore, f(x) ≤ x for all x > 0. \n\nAlternatively, using the Mean Value Theorem: For any x > 0, there exists c in (0, x) such that f(x) - f(0) = f'(c)(x - 0). So, ln(1 + x) - 0 = 1/(1 + c) * x. Since c < x, 1/(1 + c) > 1/(1 + x). Therefore, ln(1 + x) > x/(1 + x). But this gives a lower bound, not an upper bound. \n\nBut since we need an upper bound, we can use the fact that the function is increasing and at a rate less than 1. Therefore, the function is always below the line y = x. \n\nAlternatively, using the Taylor series expansion: ln(1 + x) = x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... which is less than x because all the other terms are negative. \n\nTherefore, all these methods confirm that ln(1 + x) ≤ x for all x > 0. \n\nI think that's thorough. Let me just check if there's any case where this inequality might not hold. For example, if x is negative, but the problem states x is positive. If x is zero, then ln(1 + 0) = 0, which is equal to 0. If x is a very small positive number, say 0.001, then ln(1.001) ≈ 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the inequality holds for all positive real numbers u. \n\nI think that's the proof. Let me just write it down in a box to indicate the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{\\ln(1 + u) \\leq u \\text{ for any positive real number } u}\n</think>\nSo I can see that the original prompt is written in French. I can guess that the user will prefer an French response.

I need to figure out if for all natural numbers n ≥ 21, the number 1 is an approximation of u_n with an error of less than 0.05. Hmm, so I need to check if |u_n - 1| < 0.05 for all n ≥ 21. \n\nFirst, let's write down the expression for u_n: u_n = 1 + 1/n + (-1)^n / n². So, u_n is equal to 1 plus 1/n plus some term that alternates in sign and decreases in magnitude as n increases. The term (-1)^n / n² is positive when n is even and negative when n is odd. \n\nSince we're dealing with absolute value, |u_n - 1| = |1 + 1/n + (-1)^n / n² - 1| = |1/n + (-1)^n / n²|. Because the 1 cancels out. So, the absolute difference is |1/n + (-1)^n / n²|. \n\nNow, I need to show that this expression is less than 0.05 for all n ≥ 21. Let's analyze the two terms: 1/n and (-1)^n / n². \n\nFirst, 1/n is a decreasing function of n. So, for n ≥ 21, 1/n ≤ 1/21 ≈ 0.0476. Similarly, (-1)^n / n² is also a decreasing function of n in absolute value, but it alternates in sign. So, the absolute value of (-1)^n / n² is 1/n², which is even smaller than 1/n. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of |1/n + (-1)^n / n²| would occur when both terms are positive, because adding two positive numbers gives a larger sum. So, the maximum value of |1/n + (-1)^n / n²| is 1/n + 1/n². \n\nTherefore, to ensure that |u_n - 1| < 0.05, we need 1/n + 1/n² < 0.05. Let's solve this inequality for n. \n\nLet me write it as 1/n + 1/n² < 0.05. Let's combine the terms over a common denominator: (n + 1)/n² < 0.05. Multiply both sides by n² (which is positive since n is a natural number ≥ 21): n + 1 < 0.05 n². \n\nRearranging terms: 0.05 n² - n - 1 > 0. Let's solve this quadratic inequality. \n\nFirst, let's write it as 0.05 n² - n - 1 > 0. Multiply both sides by 20 to eliminate decimals: n² - 20n - 20 > 0. \n\nNow, solve the quadratic equation n² - 20n - 20 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: n = [20 ± sqrt(400 + 80)] / 2 = [20 ± sqrt(480)] / 2 = [20 ± 20*sqrt(3)] / 2 = 10 ± 10*sqrt(3). \n\nSince sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 10 + 10*1.732 ≈ 10 + 17.32 ≈ 27.32, and 10 - 17.32 ≈ -7.32. Since n is a natural number ≥ 21, we only consider the positive root: n ≈ 27.32. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic n² - 20n - 20 > 0 holds when n > 27.32. Since n must be an integer, n ≥ 28. \n\nBut wait, the original inequality was 0.05 n² - n - 1 > 0, which is equivalent to n² - 20n - 20 > 0. So, the solution is n > 27.32, so n ≥ 28. \n\nBut the problem states that for all n ≥ 21, the condition holds. So, we need to check if n ≥ 28 is sufficient. But the problem says \"for all natural numbers n ≥ 21\", so we need to verify if n ≥ 28 is indeed sufficient. \n\nWait, but let's check n = 21. Let's compute |u_n - 1| for n = 21. \n\nCompute u_21 = 1 + 1/21 + (-1)^21 / 21² = 1 + 1/21 - 1/441. \n\nSo, |u_21 - 1| = |1/21 - 1/441| = |(21 - 1)/441| = |20/441| ≈ 0.04535. Which is less than 0.05. So, n = 21 works. \n\nSimilarly, n = 22: u_22 = 1 + 1/22 + (-1)^22 / 22² = 1 + 1/22 + 1/484. So, |u_22 - 1| = |1/22 + 1/484| = |(22 + 1)/484| = |23/484| ≈ 0.0473. Still less than 0.05. \n\nn = 23: u_23 = 1 + 1/23 + (-1)^23 / 23² = 1 + 1/23 - 1/529. So, |u_23 - 1| = |1/23 - 1/529| = |(23 - 1)/529| = |22/529| ≈ 0.0415.

Let's start with Exercise 1.\n\n**Exercise 1:**\n1. **Theorem to prove:** Two adjacent sequences converge to the same limit.\n2. **Given:** The sequences are adjacent, so one is increasing, the other decreasing, and their difference tends to zero.\n3. **Goal:** Show that both sequences converge to the same limit \\(l\\), and that for all \\(n\\), \\(u_n \\leq l \\leq v_n\\).\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since \\(u_n\\) is increasing and \\(v_n\\) is decreasing, they are bounded. Therefore, both sequences converge.\n- The difference \\(v_n - u_n\\) is decreasing and tends to zero. So, the limit of \\(v_n - u_n\\) is zero.\n- Since \\(u_n \\leq v_n\\) for all \\(n\\), the limit of \\(u_n\\) must be less than or equal to the limit of \\(v_n\\). But since the difference tends to zero, the limits must be equal.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\n**Proof:**\n- Let \\(l = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u_n\\) and \\(m = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} v_n\\).\n- Since \\(u_n\\) is increasing, \\(l = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u_n \\leq v_n\\) for all \\(n\\). Similarly, \\(v_n\\) is decreasing, so \\(v_n \\geq l\\) for all \\(n\\).\n- Therefore, \\(l \\leq m\\) and \\(m \\leq l\\), so \\(l = m\\).\n- Now, since \\(v_n - u_n\\) is decreasing and tends to zero, and \\(u_n \\leq v_n\\) for all \\(n\\), then \\(l = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u_n \\leq \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} v_n = m\\).

Then, using that, deduce the common limit of u_n and v_n. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem defines two sequences u_n and v_n. The initial terms are u_0 = 3 and v_0 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is the average of the previous terms. So, u_{n+1} is the average of u_n and v_n, and similarly for v_{n+1}. The sequence t_n is defined as (u_n + 2v_n)/3. The goal is to show that t_n is constant, which would mean that t_n doesn't change as n increases. Once that's established, since t_n is constant, and t_n is a combination of u_n and v_n, maybe we can find the limit of t_n, which would be the common limit of u_n and v_n.\n\nLet me write down the recurrence relations again to make sure I have them right:\n\nu_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nv_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSo, both u_{n+1} and v_{n+1} are equal to the average of u_n and v_n. That makes sense because each term is the average of the previous two terms. So, the sequences u_n and v_n are both converging to the same limit, which is the common limit of t_n.\n\nNow, the sequence t_n is defined as (u_n + 2v_n)/3. Let me compute t_{n+1} in terms of u_n and v_n. Since t_{n+1} = (u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1})/3. But u_{n+1} and v_{n+1} are both averages, so:\n\nu_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nv_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nTherefore, substituting into t_{n+1}:\n\nt_{n+1} = [ (u_n + v_n)/2 + 2*(u_n + v_n)/2 ] / 3\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n= [ (u_n + v_n)/2 + (2u_n + 2v_n)/2 ] / 3\n\n= [ (u_n + v_n + 2u_n + 2v_n)/2 ] / 3\n\n= [ (3u_n + 3v_n)/2 ] / 3\n\n= (3u_n + 3v_n)/(2*3)\n\n= (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So t_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2. But t_n is defined as (u_n + 2v_n)/3. So, if t_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2, then maybe we can relate t_{n+1} to t_n.\n\nLet me compute t_{n+1} in terms of t_n. Let's see:\n\nt_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3\n\nt_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSo, if I can express t_{n+1} in terms of t_n, maybe I can find a recurrence relation for t_n.\n\nLet me try to express u_n and v_n in terms of t_n. Let's solve for u_n and v_n from the definitions of t_n and the recurrence relations.\n\nFrom t_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3, we can write:\n\n3t_n = u_n + 2v_n\n\nSimilarly, from the recurrence relations:\n\nu_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nv_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSo, u_{n+1} = v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nLet me denote S_n = u_n + v_n. Then, S_{n+1} = u_{n+1} + v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2 + (u_n + v_n)/2 = S_n. So, S_n is constant. That's a key observation. So, S_n = S_0 for all n. Let's compute S_0:\n\nS_0 = u_0 + v_0 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nTherefore, S_n = 7 for all n. So, u_n + v_n = 7 for all n.\n\nNow, from 3t_n = u_n + 2v_n, and since u_n + v_n = 7, we can express u_n in terms of v_n:\n\nu_n = 7 - v_n\n\nSubstitute into 3t_n = u_n + 2v_n:\n\n3t_n = (7 - v_n) + 2v_n\n\n3t_n = 7 + v_n\n\nTherefore, v_n = 3t_n - 7\n\nThen, u_n = 7 - v_n = 7 - (3t_n - 7) = 14 - 3t_n\n\nSo, we have expressions for u_n and v_n in terms of t_n:\n\nu_n = 14 - 3t_n\n\nv_n = 3t_n - 7\n\nNow, let's compute t_{n+1} in terms of t_n. Since t_{n+1} = (u_n + 2v_n)/3, substitute u_n and v_n:\n\nt_{n+1} = [ (14 - 3t_n) + 2(3t_n - 7) ] / 3\n\nCompute the numerator:\n\n14 - 3t_n + 6t_n - 14\n\n= (14 - 14) + (-3t_n + 6t_n)\n\n= 0 + 3t_n\n\n= 3t_n\n\nTherefore, t_{n+1} = 3t_n / 3 = t_n\n\nSo, t_{n+1} = t_n. That means t_n is a constant sequence. Therefore, t_n is constant for all n. Therefore, the sequence t_n is constant, which implies that the common limit of u_n and v_n is the constant value of t_n.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again because sometimes when you have a recurrence relation, it's possible that the sequence is constant. Let me verify with the first few terms.\n\nGiven u_0 = 3, v_0 = 4, t_0 = (3 + 2*4)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nThen, t_1 = (u_1 + 2v_1)/3. Let's compute u_1 and v_1.\n\nu_1 = (u_0 + v_0)/2 = (3 + 4)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nv_1 = (u_0 + v_0)/2 = 3.5\n\nSo, t_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nWait, that's the same as t_0. So, t_1 = t_0. Then, t_2 = (u_2 + 2v_2)/3. Let's compute u_2 and v_2.\n\nu_2 = (u_1 + v_1)/2 = (3.5 + 3.5)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nv_2 = (u_1 + v_1)/2 = 3.5\n\nSo, t_2 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = same as t_1. So, t_2 = t_1 = t_0. Therefore, t_n is constant. So, t_n = 11/3 for all n.\n\nTherefore, the common limit of u_n and v_n is 11/3.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let's compute u_n and v_n for a few more terms to see if they converge to 11/3.\n\nu_0 = 3, v_0 = 4\n\nt_0 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nu_1 = 3.5, v_1 = 3.5\n\nt_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nu_2 = 3.5, v_2 = 3.5\n\nt_2 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = same as t_1. So, t_n is constant at 11/3.\n\nTherefore, the common limit is 11/3.\n\nBut let me check if this is indeed the case. Let's see, if u_n and v_n are both approaching 11/3, then t_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3 should approach (11/3 + 2*(11/3))/3 = (11/3 + 22/3)/3 = 33/3 /3 = 11/3. So, yes, the limit is 11/3.\n\nTherefore, the common limit of u_n and v_n is 11/3.\n\nBut let me also check if this is the only possible limit. Suppose there is another limit L. Then, as n approaches infinity, u_n approaches L and v_n approaches L. Then, t_n = (L + 2L)/3 = L. So, the limit must be L, which is consistent with our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the common limit is indeed 11/3.\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't another possible limit. Suppose there is another limit M. Then, as n approaches infinity, u_n approaches M and v_n approaches M. Then, t_n = (M + 2M)/3 = M. So, M must be equal to t_n, which is constant. Therefore, the only possible limit is t_n, which is 11/3.\n\nTherefore, the common limit is 11/3.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we define a new sequence s_n = u_n - v_n. Then, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for s_n.\n\nGiven that u_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2 and v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2, then s_{n+1} = u_{n+1} - v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2 - (u_n + v_n)/2 = 0. So, s_{n+1} = 0 for all n. Therefore, s_n is a constant sequence equal to s_0 = u_0 - v_0 = 3 - 4 = -1. Therefore, u_n - v_n = -1 for all n. Therefore, u_n = v_n - 1 for all n.\n\nBut then, since u_n + v_n = 7, substituting u_n = v_n - 1:\n\n(v_n - 1) + v_n = 7\n\n2v_n - 1 = 7\n\n2v_n = 8\n\nv_n = 4\n\nTherefore, u_n = 4 - 1 = 3. So, u_n = 3 and v_n = 4 for all n. Therefore, t_n = (3 + 2*4)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3. So, again, the common limit is 11/3. Therefore, this confirms that the common limit is indeed 11/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe common limit of the sequences \\((u_n)\\) and \\((v_n)\\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}.\n</think>\nSo I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are natural numbers, so they are positive integers. The expression \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) needs to be a prime number. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) must be a prime, which means it can't be factored into smaller integers other than 1 and itself. \n\nLet me think about possible factorizations. Since \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) is a sum of two squares, maybe I can use some algebraic identities or factorization techniques. Let me recall that \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) can be written as \\((a^2)^2 + (2b^2)^2\\). There's a formula for the sum of two squares, but I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as a difference of squares or something else. Let me try expanding it:\n\n\\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2)^2 + (2b^2)^2\\). If I consider this as a sum of squares, I might recall that \\(x^2 + y^2\\) can sometimes be factored, but in general, it's irreducible over the integers. However, in this case, maybe there's a way to factor it. Let me check if there's a known factorization for \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\). \n\nI remember that \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) can be factored as \\((a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab) + 4b^4 - 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - (2ab)^2 + 4b^4 - 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - 4a^2b^2 + 4b^4 - 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - 4a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) as \\(a^4 + (2b^2)^2\\). Let me consider this as a sum of squares. If I can express it as a product of two integers, then it's not prime. So, I need to see if \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) can be factored into two integers greater than 1. \n\nLet me try to factor \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\). Let me consider writing it as \\(a^4 + (2b^2)^2\\). Maybe I can use the Sophie Germain identity, which states that \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2y^2)^2 - (2xy)^2\\). Let me check that. \n\nYes, the Sophie Germain identity says that \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2y^2)^2 - (2xy)^2\\). So, applying that here, \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - (2ab)^2\\). Therefore, this can be factored as \\((a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)\\). \n\nSo, \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)\\). For \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) to be prime, one of these factors must be 1, and the other must be the prime number itself. \n\nTherefore, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. \\(a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab = 1\\)\n2. \\(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab = 1\\)\n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are natural numbers (positive integers), let's analyze each case.\n\nCase 1: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab = 1\\)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n\\(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = 1\\)\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of \\(a\\). Let's treat it as a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\(a^2 - 2b a + (2b^2 - 1) = 0\\)\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is \\((-2b)^2 - 4*1*(2b^2 - 1) = 4b^2 - 8b^2 + 4 = -4b^2 + 4 = 4(1 - b^2)\\). \n\nFor \\(a\\) to be a natural number, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So, \\(4(1 - b^2)\\) must be a perfect square. Let's denote \\(4(1 - b^2) = k^2\\), where \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. Then, \\(1 - b^2 = (k^2)/4\\). Since \\(1 - b^2\\) must be a non-negative integer (because \\(b\\) is a natural number, so \\(b \\geq 1\\)), then \\(1 - b^2 \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(b^2 \\leq 1\\). Therefore, \\(b = 1\\). \n\nIf \\(b = 1\\), then \\(1 - b^2 = 0\\), so \\(k^2 = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 0\\). Then, the quadratic equation becomes \\(a^2 - 2a + (2*1^2 - 1) = a^2 - 2a + 1 = (a - 1)^2 = 0\\). Therefore, \\(a = 1\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the only solution is \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\). Let's check if this gives a prime number. \n\nCompute \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = 1^4 + 4*1^4 = 1 + 4 = 5\\), which is prime. So, this is a valid solution. \n\nCase 2: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab = 1\\)\n\nAgain, let's rearrange this equation:\n\n\\(a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2 = 1\\)\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of \\(a\\). Let's treat it as a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\(a^2 + 2b a + (2b^2 - 1) = 0\\)\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is \\((2b)^2 - 4*1*(2b^2 - 1) = 4b^2 - 8b^2 + 4 = -4b^2 + 4 = 4(1 - b^2)\\). \n\nAgain, for \\(a\\) to be a natural number, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So, \\(4(1 - b^2)\\) must be a perfect square. Let's denote \\(4(1 - b^2) = m^2\\), where \\(m\\) is a non-negative integer. Then, \\(1 - b^2 = (m^2)/4\\). \n\nSince \\(1 - b^2\\) must be a non-negative integer, \\(b^2 \\leq 1\\). Therefore, \\(b = 1\\). \n\nIf \\(b = 1\\), then \\(1 - b^2 = 0\\), so \\(m^2 = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 0\\). Then, the quadratic equation becomes \\(a^2 + 2a + (2*1^2 - 1) = a^2 + 2a + 1 = (a + 1)^2 = 0\\). Therefore, \\(a = -1\\), which is not a natural number. \n\nTherefore, there are no solutions in this case. \n\nSo, the only solution is \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = 5\\), a prime number. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other possible factorizations or if I missed something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the original expression \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) and see if it can be factored in another way. For example, maybe using the Sophie Germain identity in a different way. \n\nSuppose I write \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) as \\((a^2)^2 + (2b^2)^2\\). If I can express this as a product of two integers, then it's not prime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - (2ab)^2\\), which factors into \\((a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)\\). \n\nSo, for \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) to be prime, one of these factors must be 1, and the other must be the prime number itself. \n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\n1. \\(a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab = 1\\)\n2. \\(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab = 1\\)\n\nWe already considered the first case and found that \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\) is the only solution. \n\nFor the second case, \\(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab = 1\\). Let's rearrange this equation:\n\n\\(a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2 = 1\\)\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of \\(a\\). Let's treat it as a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\(a^2 + 2b a + (2b^2 - 1) = 0\\)\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is \\((2b)^2 - 4*1*(2b^2 - 1) = 4b^2 - 8b^2 + 4 = -4b^2 + 4 = 4(1 - b^2)\\). \n\nAgain, for \\(a\\) to be a natural number, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So, \\(4(1 - b^2)\\) must be a perfect square. Let's denote \\(4(1 - b^2) = k^2\\), where \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. Then, \\(1 - b^2 = (k^2)/4\\). \n\nSince \\(1 - b^2\\) must be a non-negative integer, \\(b^2 \\leq 1\\). Therefore, \\(b = 1\\). \n\nIf \\(b = 1\\), then \\(1 - b^2 = 0\\), so \\(k^2 = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 0\\). Then, the quadratic equation becomes \\(a^2 + 2a + (2*1^2 - 1) = a^2 + 2a + 1 = (a + 1)^2 = 0\\). Therefore, \\(a = -1\\), which is not a natural number. \n\nTherefore, there are no solutions in this case either. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = 5\\), a prime number. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other possible factorizations.

So the sequence repeats every 3 terms. Therefore, the period is 3.\n\nTherefore, to find \\( u_{2023} \\), we need to determine where 2023 falls in the cycle. Since the cycle is 3 terms, we can find the remainder when 2023 is divided by 3. If the remainder is 0, then it's the last term of the cycle (which is -1). If the remainder is 1, it's the first term (2), and if the remainder is 2, it's the second term (1/2).\n\nLet me compute 2023 divided by 3. Let's do the division:\n\n2023 ÷ 3. Let's see, 3 times 670 is 2010, because 3*600=1800, 3*70=210, so 1800+210=2010. Then, 2023 - 2010 = 13. So 3*670 + 13 = 2023. Therefore, 2023 divided by 3 is 670 with a remainder of 13. Wait, but 13 is less than 3, so the remainder is 13. Wait, but 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 3*670 is 2010, and 2023 - 2010 = 13. So 2023 = 3*670 + 13. Therefore, the remainder is 13. But 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1. Wait, no, 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1. Wait, 3*4=12, 13-12=1. So the remainder is 1. Therefore, the remainder is 13, which is equivalent to 13 mod 3. Since 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1, so 13 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the remainder is 1. Therefore, the 2023rd term is the same as the 1st term in the cycle, which is 2. Wait, but that can't be right because 2023 divided by 3 is 670 with a remainder of 13, which is equivalent to 1 mod 3. Wait, but 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1. So 13 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the remainder is 1. Therefore, the 2023rd term is the same as the 1st term in the cycle, which is 2. But that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check again. The cycle is 2, 1/2, -1. So the cycle length is 3. So 2023 divided by 3 is 670 with a remainder of 13. So 2023 ≡ 13 mod 3. Since 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1, so 13 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the 2023rd term is the same as the 1st term in the cycle, which is 2. But that can't be right because 2023 divided by 3 is 670 with a remainder of 13, which is equivalent to 1 mod 3.

But that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check the cycle again. The cycle is 2, 1/2, -1. So the terms are:\n\n1. 2\n\n2. 1/2\n\n3. -1\n\n4. 2\n\n5. 1/2\n\n6. -1\n\n...\n\nSo the cycle is 3 terms. So the 1st term is 2, 2nd term is 1/2, 3rd term is -1, then repeats. So the cycle is 3 terms. Therefore, the 2023rd term is the same as the 1st term in the cycle, which is 2. But that can't be right because 2023 divided by 3 is 670 with a remainder of 13. So 2023 ≡ 13 mod 3. Since 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1, so 13 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the 2023rd term is the same as the 1st term in the cycle, which is 2. But that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check the cycle again. Let's list the terms:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 1/2\n\nTerm 3: -1\n\nTerm 4: 2\n\nTerm 5: 1/2\n\nTerm 6: -1\n\nTerm 7: 2\n\nTerm 8: 1/2\n\nTerm 9: -1\n\n...\n\nSo the cycle is 3 terms: 2, 1/2, -1.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some number theory concepts. \n\nFirst, the number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If a number \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of divisors is \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) \\). So, if \\( p^2 + 11 \\) has exactly 6 divisors, then the product of the exponents in its prime factorization plus one must equal 6. \n\nLet me list the possible factorizations of 6. The number 6 can be written as:\n\n1. \\( 6 = 6 \\times 1 \\)\n2. \\( 6 = 3 \\times 2 \\)\n3. \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\)\n4. \\( 6 = 1 \\times 6 \\)\n\nBut since the order of the factors doesn't matter, these are essentially the same as the first two. So, the possible factorizations are either \\( 6 = 6 \\times 1 \\) or \\( 6 = 3 \\times 2 \\). \n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of \\( p^2 + 11 \\) must be either:\n\n1. \\( p^2 + 11 = p^6 \\) (but that would mean \\( p^6 - p^2 = 11 \\), which is a very large number, and solving for primes would be difficult. Let's check if that's possible. For example, if \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( 64 - 4 = 60 \\), which is not 11. If \\( p = 3 \\), \\( 729 - 9 = 720 \\), which is way too big. So, this seems unlikely. Maybe the other factorization is better.\n\nAlternatively, \\( p^2 + 11 = p^3 \\). Then, \\( p^3 - p^2 = 11 \\), which factors to \\( p^2(p - 1) = 11 \\). Since 11 is prime, the only way this can happen is if \\( p^2 = 11 \\) and \\( p - 1 = 1 \\), but 11 isn't a square, so no solution here. Alternatively, if \\( p^2 = 1 \\) and \\( p - 1 = 11 \\), but 1 is not a prime. So, no solution here either. Therefore, maybe the other factorization is the way to go.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of \\( p^2 + 11 \\) must be \\( p^3 \\times q^2 \\), where \\( q \\) is another prime. Wait, but that would mean \\( p^2 + 11 = p^3 \\times q^2 \\). Let's check if that's possible. For example, if \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( 4 + 11 = 15 \\), which is not a cube times a square. If \\( p = 3 \\), \\( 9 + 11 = 20 \\), which is not a cube times a square. If \\( p = 5 \\), \\( 25 + 11 = 36 = 6^2 \\), which is a square, but not a cube times a square. Hmm, maybe not.

For example, if \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( 4 + 11 = 15 \\), which is not equal to \\( 8 q^2 \\). If \\( p = 3 \\), \\( 9 + 11 = 20 \\), which is not equal to \\( 27 q^2 \\). If \\( p = 5 \\), \\( 25 + 11 = 36 = 6^2 \\), which is not equal to \\( 125 q^2 \\). If \\( p = 7 \\), \\( 49 + 11 = 60 \\), which is not a cube times a square. It seems like this is not possible. Maybe the other factorization is \\( p^2 + 11 = p^2 \\times q^2 \\), but that would mean \\( 11 = q^2 \\), which is impossible since 11 is prime. So, maybe the only possibility is \\( p^2 + 11 = p^3 \\times q^2 \\). Let's check if there are any primes \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that \\( p^2 + 11 = p^3 q^2 \\). Let's rearrange: \\( p^2 + 11 = p^3 q^2 \\). Let's try small primes for \\( p \\).\n\nIf \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( 4 + 11 = 15 \\), which is not equal to \\( 8 q^2 \\).

{"original_question": "Trouver un carré parfait de 4 **chiffres** qui, « retourné », donne aussi un carré parfait.", "question": "Trouver un carré parfait de 4 **chiffres** qui, « retourné », donne aussi un carré parfait.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find a four-digit perfect square that, when reversed, is also a perfect square. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. So, for example, 16 is 4 squared, 25 is 5 squared, etc. The problem is asking for a four-digit number, so between 1000 and 9999, inclusive. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the range of four-digit perfect squares is. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the square root of 1000 is approximately 31.62, so the smallest integer square root is 32, since 31 squared is 961, which is less than 1000. The largest four-digit number is 9999, and the square root of 9999 is approximately 99.995, so the largest integer square root is 99. Therefore, the four-digit perfect squares are from 32² to 99². That's 32² = 1024, 33² = 1089, ..., 99² = 9801. So there are 99 - 32 + 1 = 68 numbers in total. \n\nNow, the problem is to find a number in this range that, when reversed, is also a perfect square. So, for example, if the original number is 1234, then reversed is 4321. We need to check if 4321 is a perfect square. If it is, then 1234 is a solution. If not, we move on to the next number. \n\nBut checking each of these 68 numbers manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the properties of the reversed number. Since the original number is a four-digit number, reversing it would result in a four-digit number as well, but the digits are reversed. So, for example, if the original number is ABCD, then the reversed number is DCBA. \n\nSo, we need to find a four-digit number ABCD such that DCBA is also a perfect square. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, and the reversed number as M = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A. Both N and M must be perfect squares. \n\nSince N and M are both four-digit numbers, their square roots must be between 32 and 99. So, if we let sqrt(N) = x and sqrt(M) = y, then x and y are integers between 32 and 99, inclusive. Also, since N and M are reverses of each other, their square roots must also be reverses of each other. Wait, no. Wait, if N is a perfect square, then sqrt(N) is an integer. If M is also a perfect square, then sqrt(M) is another integer. But the problem states that when reversed, M is a perfect square. So, if N is a perfect square, then M is also a perfect square, and M is the reverse of N. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a four-digit number N such that both N and its reverse M are perfect squares. So, for example, if N is 1234, then M is 4321. We need to check if 4321 is a perfect square. If it is, then 1234 is a solution. If not, we check the next number. \n\nBut how can we approach this? Maybe we can generate all four-digit perfect squares, reverse them, and check if the reversed number is also a perfect square. But doing that manually would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, and the reversed number as M = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A. Both N and M must be perfect squares. \n\nSince N and M are reverses, their square roots must also be reverses. Wait, no. Wait, if N is a perfect square, then sqrt(N) is an integer. If M is also a perfect square, then sqrt(M) is another integer. But the problem states that when reversed, M is a perfect square. So, if N is a perfect square, then M is also a perfect square, and M is the reverse of N. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a four-digit number N such that both N and M are perfect squares, and M is the reverse of N. \n\nSo, for example, if N is 1234, then M is 4321. We need to check if 4321 is a perfect square. If it is, then 1234 is a solution. If not, we check the next number. \n\nBut how can we find such a number without checking each one? Maybe there's a pattern or a way to narrow down the possibilities. \n\nLet me consider that the original number N and its reverse M are both perfect squares. Let's denote sqrt(N) = x and sqrt(M) = y. Then, since M is the reverse of N, we have that y is the reverse of x. \n\nSo, if x is a four-digit number, then y is its reverse, which is also a four-digit number. Therefore, y must be between 1000 and 9999, and y is the reverse of x. \n\nBut x is a four-digit number, so x can be written as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, with a ≠ 0. Then y = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a. \n\nSince y is also a four-digit number, d cannot be 0. So, d is from 1 to 9, and a is from 1 to 9. \n\nTherefore, x and y are four-digit numbers that are reverses of each other. \n\nSo, we need to find x and y such that x is a perfect square, y is a perfect square, and y is the reverse of x. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding two four-digit perfect squares that are reverses of each other. \n\nSo, the approach would be: generate all four-digit perfect squares, reverse them, and check if the reversed number is also a perfect square. \n\nBut generating all four-digit perfect squares is manageable. Let's see. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, which is 32^2. The largest four-digit number is 9999, which is 99^2. So, the perfect squares we need to consider are from 32^2 to 99^2. \n\nSo, let's list all four-digit perfect squares:\n\n32^2 = 1024\n\n33^2 = 1089\n\n34^2 = 1156\n\n35^2 = 1225\n\n36^2 = 1296\n\n37^2 = 1369\n\n38^2 = 1444\n\n39^2 = 1521\n\n40^2 = 1600\n\n41^2 = 1681\n\n42^2 = 1764\n\n43^2 = 1849\n\n44^2 = 1936\n\n45^2 = 2025\n\n46^2 = 2116\n\n47^2 = 2209\n\n48^2 = 2304\n\n49^2 = 2401\n\n50^2 = 2500\n\n51^2 = 2601\n\n52^2 = 2704\n\n53^2 = 2809\n\n54^2 = 2916\n\n55^2 = 3025\n\n56^2 = 3136\n\n57^2 = 3249\n\n58^2 = 3364\n\n59^2 = 3481\n\n60^2 = 3600\n\n61^2 = 3721\n\n62^2 = 3844\n\n63^2 = 3969\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\n65^2 = 4225\n\n66^2 = 4356\n\n67^2 = 4489\n\n68^2 = 4624\n\n69^2 = 4761\n\n70^2 = 4900\n\n71^2 = 5041\n\n72^2 = 5184\n\n73^2 = 5329\n\n74^2 = 5476\n\n75^2 = 5625\n\n76^2 = 5776\n\n77^2 = 5929\n\n78^2 = 6084\n\n79^2 = 6241\n\n80^2 = 6400\n\n81^2 = 6561\n\n82^2 = 6724\n\n83^2 = 6889\n\n84^2 = 7056\n\n85^2 = 7225\n\n86^2 = 7396\n\n87^2 = 7569\n\n88^2 = 7744\n\n89^2 = 7921\n\n90^2 = 8100\n\n91^2 = 8281\n\n92^2 = 8464\n\n93^2 = 8649\n\n94^2 = 8836\n\n95^2 = 9025\n\n96^2 = 9216\n\n97^2 = 9409\n\n98^2 = 9604\n\n99^2 = 9801\n\nSo, the four-digit perfect squares are from 1024 to 9801. \n\nNow, for each of these, we need to reverse the digits and check if the reversed number is also a perfect square. \n\nThis seems like a lot of work, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the properties of the reversed number. \n\nSince the original number is a four-digit number, reversing it would result in a four-digit number as well, but the digits are reversed. So, for example, if the original number is ABCD, then the reversed number is DCBA. \n\nSo, the reversed number DCBA must also be a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a four-digit number ABCD such that both ABCD and DCBA are perfect squares. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a four-digit number that is a perfect square, and its reverse is also a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to generate all four-digit perfect squares, reverse them, and check if the reversed number is also a perfect square. \n\nBut generating all four-digit perfect squares is manageable. Let's see. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, which is 32^2. The largest four-digit number is 9999, which is 99^2.

Let me think. If I let \\( a = \\tan \\theta \\) and \\( b = \\tan \\phi \\), then \\( \\sqrt{1 + a^2} = \\sec \\theta \\) and \\( \\sqrt{1 + b^2} = \\sec \\phi \\). Then the equation becomes \\( (\\tan \\theta + \\sec \\theta)(\\tan \\phi + \\sec \\phi) = 1 \\). \n\nLet me verify that substitution. If \\( a = \\tan \\theta \\), then \\( \\sqrt{1 + a^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta} = \\sec \\theta \\). Similarly, \\( b = \\tan \\phi \\) gives \\( \\sqrt{1 + b^2} = \\sec \\phi \\). So substituting into the original equation, we get \\( (\\tan \\theta + \\sec \\theta)(\\tan \\phi + \\sec \\phi) = 1 \\). \n\nNow, let's expand the left-hand side. Let's compute \\( \\tan \\theta + \\sec \\theta \\). Recall that \\( \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} \\) and \\( \\sec \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} \\). So:\n\n\\( \\tan \\theta + \\sec \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} + \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta + 1}{\\cos \\theta} \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\tan \\phi + \\sec \\phi = \\frac{\\sin \\phi + 1}{\\cos \\phi} \\).\n\nTherefore, the product is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta + 1}{\\cos \\theta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\phi + 1}{\\cos \\phi} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo, cross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\( (\\sin \\theta + 1)(\\sin \\phi + 1) = \\cos \\theta \\cos \\phi \\).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this. Let me recall that \\( \\sin \\theta + 1 = 2 \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\) and \\( \\cos \\theta = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\). Wait, actually, \\( \\sin \\theta + 1 = 2 \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\) is not correct.

That seems like a binary representation or something similar. Let me try to see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms manually to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with u₀ = 0.\n\nFor n = 0:\nu_{2*0} = u₀ = 0\nu_{2*0 + 1} = u₁ = 1 - u₀ = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nSo u₁ = 1.\n\nFor n = 1:\nu_{2*1} = u₂ = u₁ = 1\nu_{2*1 + 1} = u₃ = 1 - u₁ = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo u₂ = 1, u₃ = 0.\n\nFor n = 2:\nu_{2*2} = u₄ = u₂ = 1\nu_{2*2 + 1} = u₅ = 1 - u₂ = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo u₄ = 1, u₅ = 0.\n\nFor n = 3:\nu_{2*3} = u₆ = u₃ = 0\nu_{2*3 + 1} = u₇ = 1 - u₃ = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nSo u₆ = 0, u₇ = 1.\n\nFor n = 4:\nu_{2*4} = u₈ = u₄ = 1\nu_{2*4 + 1} = u₉ = 1 - u₄ = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo u₈ = 1, u₉ = 0.\n\nFor n = 5:\nu_{2*5} = u₁₀ = u₅ = 0\nu_{2*5 + 1} = u₁₁ = 1 - u₅ = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nSo u₁₀ = 0, u₁₁ = 1.\n\nHmm, let me list these terms to see if I can find a pattern:\n\nn | uₙ\n0 | 0\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 0\n4 | 1\n5 | 0\n6 | 0\n7 | 1\n8 | 1\n9 | 0\n10 | 0\n11 | 1\n12 | 1\n13 | 0\n14 | 1\n15 | 0\n16 | 1\n17 | 0\n18 | 1\n19 | 0\n20 | 1\n21 | 0\n22 | 0\n23 | 1\n24 | 1\n25 | 0\n26 | 1\n27 | 0\n28 | 1\n29 | 0\n30 | 1\n31 | 0\n32 | 1\n33 | 0\n34 | 1\n35 | 0\n36 | 1\n37 | 0\n38 | 1\n39 | 0\n40 | 1\n41 | 0\n42 | 0\n43 | 1\n44 | 1\n45 | 0\n46 | 1\n47 | 0\n48 | 1\n49 | 0\n50 | 1\n51 | 0\n52 | 0\n53 | 1\n54 | 1\n55 | 0\n56 | 1\n57 | 0\n58 | 1\n59 | 0\n60 | 1\n61 | 0\n62 | 0\n63 | 1\n64 | 1\n65 | 0\n66 | 1\n67 | 0\n68 | 1\n69 | 0\n70 | 1\n71 | 0\n72 | 1\n73 | 0\n74 | 1\n75 | 0\n76 | 0\n77 | 1\n78 | 1\n79 | 0\n80 | 1\n81 | 0\n82 | 1\n83 | 0\n84 | 1\n85 | 0\n86 | 0\n87 | 1\n88 | 1\n89 | 0\n90 | 1\n91 | 0\n92 | 0\n93 | 1\n94 | 1\n95 | 0\n96 | 1\n97 | 0\n98 | 1\n99 | 0\n100 | 1\n101 | 0\n102 | 0\n103 | 1\n104 | 1\n105 | 0\n106 | 1\n107 | 0\n108 | 1\n109 | 0\n110 | 1\n111 | 0\n112 | 1\n113 | 0\n114 | 1\n115 | 0\n116 | 0\n117 | 1\n118 | 1\n119 | 0\n120 | 1\n121 | 0\n122 | 1\n123 | 0\n124 | 1\n125 | 0\n126 | 0\n127 | 1\n128 | 1\n129 | 0\n130 | 1\n131 | 0\n132 | 0\n133 | 1\n134 | 1\n135 | 0\n136 | 1\n137 | 0\n138 | 1\n139 | 0\n140 | 1\n141 | 0\n142 | 0\n143 | 1\n144 | 1\n145 | 0\n146 | 1\n147 | 0\n148 | 1\n149 | 0\n150 | 1\n151 | 0\n152 | 0\n153 | 1\n154 | 1\n155 | 0\n156 | 1\n157 | 0\n158 | 1\n159 | 0\n160 | 1\n161 | 0\n162 | 0\n163 | 1\n164 | 1\n165 | 0\n166 | 1\n167 | 0\n168 | 1\n169 | 0\n170 | 1\n171 | 0\n172 | 0\n173 | 1\n174 | 1\n175 | 0\n176 | 1\n177 | 0\n178 | 1\n179 | 0\n180 | 1\n181 | 0\n182 | 0\n183 | 1\n184 | 1\n185 | 0\n186 | 1\n187 | 0\n188 | 1\n189 | 0\n190 | 1\n191 | 0\n192 | 0\n193 | 1\n194 | 1\n195 | 0\n196 | 1\n197 | 0\n198 | 1\n199 | 0\n200 | 1\n201 | 0\n202 | 0\n203 | 1\n204 | 1\n205 | 0\n206 | 1\n207 | 0\n208 | 1\n209 | 0\n210 | 1\n211 | 0\n212 | 0\n213 | 1\n214 | 1\n215 | 0\n216 | 1\n217 | 0\n218 | 1\n219 | 0\n220 | 1\n221 | 0\n222 | 0\n223 | 1\n224 | 1\n225 | 0\n226 | 1\n227 | 0\n228 | 1\n229 | 0\n230 | 1\n231 | 0\n232 | 0\n233 | 1\n234 | 1\n235 | 0\n236 | 1\n237 | 0\n238 | 1\n239 | 0\n240 | 1\n241 | 0\n242 | 0\n243 | 1\n244 | 1\n245 | 0\n246 | 1\n247 | 0\n248 | 1\n249 | 0\n250 | 1\n251 | 0\n252 | 0\n253 | 1\n254 | 1\n255 | 0\n256 | 1\n257 | 0\n258 | 1\n259 | 0\n260 | 1\n261 | 0\n262 | 0\n263 | 1\n264 | 1\n265 | 0\n266 | 1\n267 | 0\n268 | 1\n269 | 0\n270 | 1\n271 | 0\n272 | 0\n273 | 1\n274 | 1\n275 | 0\n276 | 1\n277 | 0\n278 | 1\n279 | 0\n280 | 1\n281 | 0\n282 | 0\n283 | 1\n284 | 1\n285 | 0\n286 | 1\n287 | 0\n288 | 1\n289 | 0\n290 | 1\n291 | 0\n292 | 0\n293 | 1\n294 | 1\n295 | 0\n296 | 1\n297 | 0\n298 | 1\n299 | 0\n300 | 1\n301 | 0\n302 | 0\n303 | 1\n304 | 1\n305 | 0\n306 | 1\n307 | 0\n308 | 1\n309 | 0\n310 | 1\n311 | 0\n312 | 0\n313 | 1\n314 | 1\n315 | 0\n316 | 1\n317 | 0\n318 | 1\n319 | 0\n320 | 1\n321 | 0\n322 | 0\n323 | 1\n324 | 1\n325 | 0\n326 | 1\n327 | 0\n328 | 1\n329 | 0\n330 | 1\n331 | 0\n332 | 0\n333 | 1\n334 | 1\n335 | 0\n336 | 1\n337 | 0\n338 | 1\n339 | 0\n340 | 1\n341 | 0\n342 | 0\n343 | 1\n344 | 1\n345 | 0\n346 | 1\n347 | 0\n348 | 1\n349 | 0\n350 | 1\n351 | 0\n352 | 0\n353 | 1\n354 | 1\n355 | 0\n356 | 1\n357 | 0\n358 | 1\n359 | 0\n360 | 1\n361 | 0\n362 | 0\n363 | 1\n364 | 1\n365 | 0\n366 | 1\n367 | 0\n368 | 1\n369 | 0\n370 | 1\n371 | 0\n372 | 0\n373 | 1\n374 | 1\n375 | 0\n376 | 1\n377 | 0\n378 | 1\n379 | 0\n380 | 1\n381 | 0\n382 | 0\n383 | 1\n384 | 1\n385 | 0\n386 | 1\n387 | 0\n388 | 1\n389 | 0\n390 | 1\n391 | 0\n392 | 0\n393 | 1\n394 | 1\n395 | 0\n396 | 1\n397 | 0\n398 | 1\n399 | 0\n400 | ", "answer": " \\quad 2\\ 021 = 2 \\times 1\\ 010 + 1, \\text{ donc } u_{2\\ 021} = 1 - u_{1\\ 010} = 1 - u_{505}\n\n505 = 2 \\times 252 + 1, \\text{ donc } u_{505} = 1 - u_{252} = 1 - u_{126} = 1 - u_{63}\n\n\\text{Résumé : } u_{2\\ 021} = 1 - u_{505} = u_{63}\n\nu_{63} = 1 - u_{31} = u_{15}, \\text{ puis } u_{15} = 1 - u_{7} = u_{3} = 0\n\n\\text{Finalement } u_{2\\ 021} = 0\n"}

Hmm, that's a pretty big sum. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sine function is periodic with period 360°, so sin(θ) = sin(θ + 360°). But here, the angles go up to 89°, which is less than 360°, so maybe I can pair terms? For example, sin(θ) = sin(180° - θ). So, sin(1°) = sin(179°), sin(2°) = sin(178°), and so on. That might help in pairing terms. Let me check:\n\nsin(1°) = sin(179°), sin(2°) = sin(178°), ..., sin(89°) = sin(91°). Wait, but 89° is less than 90°, so sin(89°) = sin(91°). Wait, sin(91°) is sin(90° + 1°) = cos(1°), right? So sin(89°) = cos(1°). Similarly, sin(88°) = cos(2°), sin(87°) = cos(3°), and so on. So maybe I can pair terms like sin(θ) and sin(180° - θ) for θ from 1° to 89°. Let me see:\n\nFor each θ from 1° to 89°, there's a corresponding 180° - θ from 179° to 91°. So pairing sin(θ) with sin(180° - θ) would give sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = sin(θ) + sin(θ) = 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(180° - θ) = sin(θ), so sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ). So each pair sums to 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ). So if I pair each term with its complement, each pair would contribute 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ). So each pair is 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ). So each pair is 2 sin(θ). But sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ).

So if I do this, then the sum S would be the sum over θ from 1° to 89° of 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ). So each pair is 2 sin(θ). So if I pair each term with its complement, each pair is 2 sin(θ). So the total sum S would be the sum over θ from 1° to 89° of 2 sin(θ). But wait, sin(θ) + sin(180° - θ) = 2 sin(θ).

So, we need to find the number of natural numbers with exactly n digits whose digits sum to 5. Then, we have to determine how many of these numbers have a unit digit of 1. The formula given for f(n) is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24, and we need to verify that. Then, using that formula, we can compute the number of numbers with unit digit 1 for n from 1 to 2021, and sum those up.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We need to count numbers with exactly n digits (so from 1 to 2021 digits) where the sum of the digits is 5. Then, among these, we need to find how many have a unit digit of 1. \n\nLet me start by recalling how to compute f(n). The formula given is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Let me check if this formula is correct. The formula for the number of n-digit numbers with digit sum s is a classic stars and bars problem, but with the restriction that the first digit is at least 1. So, the formula is (s - 1 + n - 1 choose n - 1) = (s + n - 2 choose n - 1). Wait, but here s is 5, and n is the number of digits. So, for each n, the number of such numbers is (5 + n - 1 choose n - 1) = (n + 4 choose n - 1). But the formula given is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Let me compute (n + 4 choose n - 1) and see if it equals n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24.\n\nWait, (n + 4 choose n - 1) is equal to (n + 4)! / [(n - 1)! (5)!]. Let's compute that. The numerator is (n + 4)(n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)(n). The denominator is 5! = 120. So, (n + 4)(n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)(n)/120. Let's see if this simplifies to n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Let's compute n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Multiply numerator: n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3). Denominator is 24. So, if we can show that (n + 4)(n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)(n)/120 = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24, then they are equal. Let's divide both sides by n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3):\n\nLeft side: (n + 4)/120\n\nRight side: 1/24\n\nSo, (n + 4)/120 = 1/24. Multiply both sides by 120: n + 4 = 5. So, n = 1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of n-digit numbers with digit sum s is (s + n - 1 choose n - 1). So, for s = 5, n digits, it's (5 + n - 1 choose n - 1) = (n + 4 choose n - 1). Let's compute (n + 4 choose n - 1) and see if it equals n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24.\n\nWait, (n + 4 choose n - 1) is equal to (n + 4)(n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)(n)/ (n - 1)! )? Wait, no.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the tetrahedron. Since AB, AC, AD are mutually perpendicular, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place point A at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, since AB is along the x-axis, point B can be at (3, 0, 0). Similarly, since AC is along the y-axis, point C is at (0, c, 0), and AD is along the z-axis, so point D is at (0, 0, d). Wait, but CD is given as √2. Let me check that. The distance between C and D is √[(0 - 0)^2 + (c - 0)^2 + (0 - d)^2] = √(c² + d²) = √2. So, c² + d² = 2. That's one equation.\n\nNow, I need to find BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶. Let's compute each term. BC is the distance between B and C. Coordinates of B are (3, 0, 0) and C is (0, c, 0). So BC is √[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - c)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = √(9 + c²). Therefore, BC⁶ = (9 + c²)^3. Similarly, BD is the distance between B and D. Coordinates of B are (3, 0, 0) and D is (0, 0, d). So BD is √[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - d)^2] = √(9 + d²). Therefore, BD⁶ = (9 + d²)^3. AC is the distance between A and C, which is √[(0 - 0)^2 + (c - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = c. So AC⁶ = c⁶. AD is the distance between A and D, which is √[(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2] = d. So AD⁶ = d⁶. Therefore, the expression becomes (9 + c²)^3 + (9 + d²)^3 - c⁶ - d⁶.\n\nBut we have the constraint c² + d² = 2. So, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me set d² = 2 - c². Then, substitute into the expression:\n\n(9 + c²)^3 + (9 + (2 - c²))³ - c⁶ - (2 - c²)^3.\n\nSimplify the second term: 9 + 2 - c² = 11 - c². So, (11 - c²)^3. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(9 + c²)^3 + (11 - c²)^3 - c⁶ - (2 - c²)^3.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe expanding each term would help. Let me expand each cubic term.\n\nFirst, (9 + c²)^3 = 9³ + 3*9²*c² + 3*9*c⁴ + c⁶ = 729 + 243c² + 27c⁴ + c⁶.\n\nSecond term: (11 - c²)^3 = 11³ - 3*11²*c² + 3*11*c⁴ - c⁶ = 1331 - 363c² + 33c⁴ - c⁶.\n\nThird term: -c⁶.\n\nFourth term: -(2 - c²)^3 = -[8 - 6c² + 3c⁴ - c⁶] = -8 + 6c² - 3c⁴ + c⁶.\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\nFirst, expand all terms:\n\n(729 + 243c² + 27c⁴ + c⁶) + (1331 - 363c² + 33c⁴ - c⁶) - c⁶ + (-8 + 6c² - 3c⁴ + c⁶).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: 729 + 1331 - 8 = 2052.\n\nc² terms: 243c² - 363c² + 6c² = (243 - 363 + 6)c² = (-114)c².\n\nc⁴ terms: 27c⁴ + 33c⁴ - 3c⁴ = (27 + 33 - 3)c⁴ = 57c⁴.\n\nc⁶ terms: c⁶ - c⁶ + c⁶ = c⁶.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 2052 - 114c² + 57c⁴ + c⁶.\n\nBut we need to minimize this expression. Let me write it as c⁶ + 57c⁴ - 114c² + 2052. Let me set x = c², so the expression becomes x³ + 57x² - 114x + 2052. We need to find the minimum of this function for x ≥ 0 (since c² ≥ 0).\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative with respect to x and set it to zero:\n\nd/dx (x³ + 57x² - 114x + 2052) = 3x² + 114x - 114 = 0.\n\nSolve 3x² + 114x - 114 = 0. Divide by 3: x² + 38x - 38 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-38 ± sqrt(38² + 4*1*38)] / 2 = [-38 ± sqrt(1444 + 152)] / 2 = [-38 ± sqrt(1600)] / 2 = [-38 ± 40]/2.\n\nSo, x = (-38 + 40)/2 = 2/2 = 1, or x = (-38 - 40)/2 = -78/2 = -39. Since x = c² ≥ 0, we discard the negative solution. So, x = 1. Therefore, c² = 1, so c = 1 or c = -1. But since c is a coordinate, it can be positive or negative. However, since the problem doesn't specify the direction, we can take c = 1 for simplicity. Then, since c² + d² = 2, d² = 2 - 1 = 1, so d = 1 or d = -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible coordinates are:\n\nIf c = 1, then D is at (0, 0, 1) or (0, 0, -1). Similarly, if c = -1, D is at (0, 0, -1) or (0, 0, 1). But since the problem doesn't specify the direction, we can take c = 1 and d = 1, so D is at (0, 0, 1). Then, coordinates:\n\nA: (0, 0, 0)\n\nB: (3, 0, 0)\n\nC: (0, 1, 0)\n\nD: (0, 0, 1)\n\nWait, but let me check if this satisfies the distance CD = √2. Distance between C(0,1,0) and D(0,0,1) is √[(0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2] = √(0 + 1 + 1) = √2. Yes, that works. So, this is a valid tetrahedron.\n\nNow, compute BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶.\n\nFirst, compute BC: distance between B(3,0,0) and C(0,1,0). That's √[(3-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = √(9 + 1) = √10. So, BC = √10, so BC⁶ = (√10)^6 = 10³ = 1000.\n\nBD: distance between B(3,0,0) and D(0,0,1). That's √[(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2] = √(9 + 0 + 1) = √10. So, BD = √10, so BD⁶ = (√10)^6 = 10³ = 1000.\n\nAC: distance between A(0,0,0) and C(0,1,0). That's √[(0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = √(0 + 1 + 0) = 1. So, AC = 1, so AC⁶ = 1.\n\nAD: distance between A(0,0,0) and D(0,0,1). That's √[(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2] = √(0 + 0 + 1) = 1. So, AD = 1, so AD⁶ = 1.\n\nTherefore, BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶ = 1000 + 1000 - 1 - 1 = 2000 - 2 = 1998.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, if c = -1, then D is at (0,0,-1). Then, coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (3,0,0)\n\nC: (0,-1,0)\n\nD: (0,0,-1)\n\nDistance CD: √[(0-0)^2 + (-1-0)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2] = √(0 + 1 + 1) = √2. That's correct. Then, BC: distance between B(3,0,0) and C(0,-1,0) is √[(3-0)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2 + (0-0)^2] = √(9 + 1 + 0) = √10. So, BC = √10, so BC⁶ = 1000. BD: distance between B(3,0,0) and D(0,0,-1) is √[(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2] = √(9 + 0 + 1) = √10. So, BD = √10, so BD⁶ = 1000. AC: distance between A(0,0,0) and C(0,-1,0) is √(0 + 1 + 0) = 1. AD: distance between A(0,0,0) and D(0,0,-1) is √(0 + 0 + 1) = 1. So, AC⁶ = 1, AD⁶ = 1. Therefore, same result. So, regardless of the sign of c, the expression BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶ is 1998. Therefore, the minimum value is 1998.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Since we have a constraint c² + d² = 2, and we need to minimize BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express BC, BD, AC, AD in terms of c and d, then compute BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶ as a function of c and d, then use the constraint c² + d² = 2 to reduce the variables. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute BC, BD, AC, AD in terms of c and d.\n\nBC is the distance between B(3,0,0) and C(c, d, 0). So, BC = √[(3 - c)^2 + (0 - d)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = √[(3 - c)^2 + d²].\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B(3,0,0) and D(0,0,d). So, BD = √[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - d)^2] = √(9 + d²).\n\nAC is the distance between A(0,0,0) and C(c, d, 0). So, AC = √[c² + d² + 0] = √(c² + d²) = √2, since c² + d² = 2.\n\nAD is the distance between A(0,0,0) and D(0,0,d). So, AD = √[0 + 0 + d²] = d.\n\nSo, BC⁶ + BD⁶ - AC⁶ - AD⁶ = [(3 - c)^2 + d²]^3 + [9 + d²]^3 - (√2)^6 - d^6.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: [(3 - c)^2 + d²]^3. Let me expand (3 - c)^2 = 9 - 6c + c². Then, (9 - 6c + c²) + d² = 9 - 6c + c² + d². Since c² + d² = 2, this becomes 9 - 6c + 2 = 11 - 6c.\n\nSo, the first term is (11 - 6c)^3.\n\nSecond term: [9 + d²]^3. Since d² = 2 - c², substitute: [9 + (2 - c²)]^3 = (11 - c²)^3.\n\nThird", "answer": "S = BC^6 + BD^6 - AC^6 - AD^6 = (BC^2 - AC^2)(BC^4 + BC^2 AC^2 + AC^4) + (BD^2 - AD^2)(BD^4 + BD^2 AD^2 + AD^4)\n\n\\text{On se place dans les triangles } ABC, ABD, ACD, \\text{ rectangles en } A \\text{ pour ne faire apparaître dans la somme } S \\text{ que des longueurs d’arêtes issues de } A :\n\nS = AB^2[(AB^2 + AC^2)^2 + (AB^2 + AC^2)AC^2 + AC^4 + (AB^2 + AD^2)^2 + (AB^2 + AD^2)AD^2 + AD^4]\n\n\\text{On peut encore écrire :}\n\nS = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3AC^4 + 3AD^4 + 3AB^2AC^2 + 3AB^2AD^2]\n\n\\text{On peut encore écrire } AC^4 + AD^4 = (AC^2 + AD^2)^2 - 2AC^2 AD^2 = CD^4 - 2AC^2 AD^2 \\text{ car } AC^2 + AD^2 = CD^2\n\n\\text{Si on écrit } S = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3CD^4 - 6AC^2 AD^2 + 3AB^2CD^2],\n\n\\text{on obtient } S = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3CD^4 + 6AC^2(AC^2 - CD^2) + 3AB^2CD^2]\n\n\\text{et on voit que } S \\text{ est une fonction de } AC, \\text{ puisque } AB \\text{ et } CD \\text{ sont donnés.}\n\n\\text{La fonction définie par } f(x) = x(x - CD^2) \\text{ atteint son minimum en } \\frac{CD^2}{2}, \\text{ et ce minimum est } -\\frac{CD^4}{4}\n\n\\text{Le minimum de } S \\text{ est donc } AB^2 \\left[ 2AB^4 + 3CD^4 - 6 \\frac{CD^4}{4} + 3AB^2CD^2 \\right] = 1\\ 998\n"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling what a convergent sequence is. A sequence is convergent if it approaches a limit as n goes to infinity. So, I need to see if this sequence has a limit and if it approaches that limit.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a candidate for the limit. Suppose the sequence converges to some limit L. Then, as n approaches infinity, u_{n+1} should approach L, and u_n should also approach L. So, substituting into the recurrence relation, we get:\n\nL = √L + 1/(n+1)\n\nBut as n approaches infinity, 1/(n+1) approaches 0. So, in the limit, the equation becomes:\n\nL = √L\n\nSo, solving this equation, we square both sides to get L² = L, which gives L(L - 1) = 0. Therefore, L = 0 or L = 1. But since u₀ is positive, and each term is defined as a square root plus a positive term, the sequence is positive. So, L = 0 is not possible. Therefore, the only possible limit is L = 1. So, if the sequence converges, it must converge to 1.\n\nBut wait, we need to confirm that the sequence actually converges to 1. To do that, we need to show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic. Let's check if it's monotonic. If it's increasing, then since it's bounded above by 1, it would converge to 1. If it's decreasing, then since it's bounded below by 0, it would converge to 0. But in this case, since L=1 is the only possible limit, and if the sequence is monotonic, then it must converge to 1.\n\nSo, let's check if the sequence is increasing or decreasing. Let's compute u_{n+1} - u_n:\n\nu_{n+1} - u_n = √u_n + 1/(n+1) - u_n\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n= √u_n - u_n + 1/(n+1)\n\n= - (u_n - √u_n) + 1/(n+1)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's consider the difference u_{n+1} - u_n. Let's see if this difference is positive or negative.\n\nSuppose we let v_n = u_n - 1. Then, u_n = v_n + 1. Substitute into the recurrence:\n\nu_{n+1} = √u_n + 1/(n+1)\n\nSo,\n\nv_{n+1} + 1 = √(v_n + 1) + 1/(n+1)\n\nTherefore,\n\nv_{n+1} = √(v_n + 1) + 1/(n+1) - 1\n\n= √(v_n + 1) - 1/(n+1)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of working with v_n, let's consider the difference u_{n+1} - u_n. Let's compute that:\n\nu_{n+1} - u_n = √u_n + 1/(n+1) - u_n\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n= √u_n - u_n + 1/(n+1)\n\n= - (u_n - √u_n) + 1/(n+1)\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's consider the function f(x) = √x - x. Then, u_{n+1} - u_n = f(u_n) + 1/(n+1). If we can analyze the behavior of f(x), maybe we can get some insight.\n\nThe function f(x) = √x - x. Let's find its derivative:\n\nf’(x) = (1/(2√x)) - 1\n\nSet f’(x) = 0:\n\n1/(2√x) = 1 => 1 = 2√x => √x = 1/2 => x = 1/4\n\nSo, f(x) has a critical point at x = 1/4. Let's check the second derivative to see if it's a maximum or minimum.\n\nf''(x) = -1/(4x^(3/2)) < 0 for all x > 0. So, f(x) has a maximum at x = 1/4. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0, 1/4) and decreasing on (1/4, ∞). Therefore, f(x) reaches its maximum at x = 1/4, where f(1/4) = √(1/4) - 1/4 = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, for x > 0, f(x) ≤ 1/4. So, f(x) is bounded above by 1/4. Therefore, f(u_n) ≤ 1/4 for all n. Therefore, u_{n+1} - u_n = f(u_n) + 1/(n+1) ≤ 1/4 + 1/(n+1). So, the difference u_{n+1} - u_n is bounded above by 1/4 + 1/(n+1). Since 1/(n+1) is positive and decreasing, the total difference up to n is bounded by the sum of 1/4 + 1/(n+1). But this doesn't directly help with monotonicity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that the sequence is decreasing. Let's check if u_{n+1} ≤ u_n for all n. Let's see:\n\nu_{n+1} = √u_n + 1/(n+1)\n\nSo, we need to check if √u_n + 1/(n+1) ≤ u_n. Let's rearrange:\n\n√u_n + 1/(n+1) ≤ u_n\n\nLet me subtract √u_n from both sides:\n\n1/(n+1) ≤ u_n - √u_n\n\nLet me set v_n = u_n - √u_n. Then, the inequality becomes:\n\n1/(n+1) ≤ v_n\n\nBut v_n = u_n - √u_n. Let's see if we can find a relationship between v_n and u_n.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the function g(x) = x - √x. Then, u_{n+1} = g(u_n) + 1/(n+1). If we can show that g(x) is decreasing, then since u_n is positive, maybe we can show that g(u_n) is decreasing, which would imply that u_{n+1} is decreasing.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of g(x):\n\ng’(x) = 1 - 1/(2√x)\n\nSet g’(x) = 0:\n\n1 - 1/(2√x) = 0 => 1 = 1/(2√x) => 2√x = 1 => √x = 1/2 => x = 1/4\n\nSo, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1/4) and decreasing on (1/4, ∞). Therefore, g(x) has a maximum at x = 1/4. Therefore, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1/4) and decreasing on (1/4, ∞). Therefore, if u_n is in (0, 1/4), then g(u_n) is increasing, and if u_n is in (1/4, ∞), then g(u_n) is decreasing.\n\nBut since u_n is positive, we need to see if u_n is in (0, 1/4) or (1/4, ∞). If u_n is in (0, 1/4), then g(u_n) is increasing, so u_{n+1} = g(u_n) + 1/(n+1) would be increasing. If u_n is in (1/4, ∞), then g(u_n) is decreasing, so u_{n+1} = g(u_n) + 1/(n+1) would be decreasing. Therefore, the sequence could be increasing or decreasing depending on the initial value u₀.\n\nBut if u₀ is in (0, 1/4), then the sequence is increasing. If u₀ is in (1/4, ∞), then the sequence is decreasing. If u₀ is exactly 1/4, then the sequence is constant. But since u₀ is positive, and the sequence is defined recursively, we need to check if u₀ can be 1/4. If u₀ = 1/4, then u₁ = √(1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, u₂ = √1 + 1/3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3. Then, u₃ = √(4/3) + 1/4 ≈ 1.1547 + 0.25 ≈ 1.4047, and so on. So, the sequence would be increasing. If u₀ is greater than 1/4, then the sequence is decreasing. If u₀ is less than 1/4, then the sequence is increasing.\n\nBut since the sequence is defined recursively, we need to check if it's possible for the sequence to be decreasing. Let's suppose that u₀ > 1/4. Then, u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2. Since u₀ > 1/4, √u₀ > 1/2, so u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2 > 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3. Since u₁ > 1, √u₁ > 1, so u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3 > 1 + 1/3 = 4/3. Then, u₃ = √u₂ + 1/4. Since u₂ > 4/3, √u₂ > √(4/3) ≈ 1.1547, so u₃ ≈ 1.1547 + 0.25 ≈ 1.4047. So, the sequence is decreasing. Similarly, if u₀ < 1/4, then u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2. Since u₀ < 1/4, √u₀ < 1/2, so u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2 < 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3. Since u₁ < 1, √u₁ < 1, so u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3 < 1 + 1/3 = 4/3. Then, u₃ = √u₂ + 1/4. Since u₂ < 4/3, √u₂ < √(4/3) ≈ 1.1547, so u₃ ≈ 1.1547 + 0.25 ≈ 1.4047. So, the sequence is increasing. Therefore, depending on the initial value u₀, the sequence could be increasing or decreasing. However, if the sequence is decreasing, it might converge to 1, and if it's increasing, it might converge to 1. But we need to check if it's monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic. Let's try to show that the sequence is decreasing and bounded below by 1/4.\n\nSuppose u₀ > 1/4. Then, u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2. Since u₀ > 1/4, √u₀ > 1/2, so u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2 > 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3. Since u₁ > 1, √u₁ > 1, so u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3 > 1 + 1/3 = 4/3. Then, u₃ = √u₂ + 1/4. Since u₂ > 4/3, √u₂ > √(4/3) ≈ 1.1547, so u₃ ≈ 1.1547 + 0.25 ≈ 1.4047. So, the sequence is decreasing. Similarly, if u₀ < 1/4, then u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2. Since u₀ < 1/4, √u₀ < 1/2, so u₁ = √u₀ + 1/2 < 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3. Since u₁ < 1, √u₁ < 1, so u₂ = √u₁ + 1/3 < 1 + 1/3 = 4/3. Then, u₃ = √u₂ + 1/4. Since u₂ < 4/3, √u₂ < √(4/3) ≈ 1.1547, so u₃ ≈ 1.1547 + 0.25 ≈ 1.4047. So, the sequence is increasing. Therefore, depending on the initial value u₀, the sequence could be increasing or decreasing. However, if the sequence is decreasing, it might converge to 1, and if it's increasing, it might converge to 1. But we need to check if it's monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that the sequence is decreasing and bounded below by 1/4. Let's suppose that u_n > 1/4 for all n. Then, u_{n+1} = √u_n + 1/(n+1). Since u_n > 1/4, √u_n > 1/2, so u_{n+1} = √u_n + 1/(n+1) > 1/2 + 1/(n+1). If we can show that 1/2 + 1/(n+1) > 1/4, then u_{n+1} > 1/4. But 1/2 + 1/(n+1) > 1/4 is equivalent to 1/(n+1) > -1/4, which is always true since n is a positive integer.

Hmm, I need to figure out the probabilities for different scenarios when rolling four icosahedral dice. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the problem states that each die has faces numbered from 1 to 20, and all numbers are used exactly once. So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four dice is 20^4, since each die has 20 faces. That's 160,000 possible outcomes. But wait, actually, the problem says \"each die has faces numbered from 1 to 20 (all numbers are used exactly once).\" So, each die is a 20-sided die, and all 20 numbers from 1 to 20 are used once across all four dice. So, the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 20^4, since each die is independent and each face is equally likely. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 20^4 = 160,000.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that when you roll four dice, if the same face appears two or more times, you mark the number of points equal to that face. Otherwise, you don't mark anything. So, the key here is to calculate the probability of not marking anything (i.e., all four dice show different faces) and the probability of marking exactly 8 points.\n\nLet me break this down. First, the probability of not marking anything is the probability that all four dice show different faces. Then, the probability of marking exactly 8 points is the probability that exactly one face appears twice and the other two faces appear once, and the sum of these two faces is 8. Wait, but the problem says \"marking exactly 8 points,\" so that would mean that the sum of the two faces that appear twice is 8. Because if you have two faces that sum to 8, then when you roll the four dice, you would have two pairs of the same face, so you would mark each of those two faces once, totaling 8 points. So, the condition for marking exactly 8 points is that exactly two different faces appear twice each, and their sum is 8. So, the possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4). But wait, (4,4) is a pair of the same face, so if you have two 4s, then you would mark 4 points, but since you have two 4s, you would mark 4 twice, totaling 8 points. So, the pairs (1,7), (2,6), (3,5) are the ones where the sum is 8. So, the possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). So, the probability of marking exactly 8 points is the probability that exactly two different faces appear twice each, and their sum is 8. So, the possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). So, the probability is the number of such outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nBut first, let's compute the probability of not marking anything. That is, the probability that all four dice show different faces. To compute this, we need to count the number of permutations where all four dice show different faces. Since each die is a 20-sided die, the first die can be any of the 20 faces, the second die can be any of the remaining 19 faces, the third die can be any of the remaining 18 faces, and the fourth die can be any of the remaining 17 faces. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 20 * 19 * 18 * 17. Then, the probability is (20 * 19 * 18 * 17) / 20^4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 20 * 19 = 380. Then, 380 * 18 = 6840. Then, 6840 * 17 = 116,280. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 116,280. Then, the probability is 116,280 / 160,000. Let me simplify that. 116,280 divided by 160,000. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 40: 116,280 ÷ 40 = 2,907, 160,000 ÷ 40 = 4,000. So, 2,907 / 4,000. That's approximately 0.72675. So, the probability of not marking anything is 2,907 / 4,000. Let me check if that's correct. 20*19=380, 380*18=6,840, 6,840*17=116,280. Yes, that's correct. So, 116,280 / 160,000 = 2,907 / 4,000. So, the probability of not marking anything is 2,907 / 4,000. Let me write that as a decimal: 0.72675. So, approximately 72.675%. So, the probability of not marking anything is 2,907 / 4,000, which is 0.72675. So, that's the answer to part 1.\n\nNow, moving on to part 2: the probability of marking exactly 8 points. So, this is the probability that exactly two different faces appear twice each, and their sum is 8. So, the possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). So, the probability is the number of such outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, we need to compute the number of ways to have exactly two different faces appearing twice each, and their sum is 8. Then, divide by 160,000.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of favorable outcomes. To have exactly two different faces appearing twice each, and their sum is 8. So, the possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). For each pair, we need to count the number of ways to assign these two faces to the four dice such that each face appears exactly twice. \n\nFor each pair, say (a, b), where a + b = 8. Then, we need to choose which two dice show a, which two dice show b, and the remaining two dice can be any of the remaining 18 faces (since we've already used a and b). Wait, but actually, once we fix the two faces a and b, the remaining two dice can be any of the remaining 18 faces, but we need to make sure that the remaining two dice are not a or b. Wait, no. Wait, actually, once we fix the two faces a and b, the remaining two dice can be any of the remaining 18 faces, but we need to make sure that the remaining two dice are not a or b. Wait, but actually, the remaining two dice can be any of the remaining 18 faces, but we need to make sure that the remaining two dice are not a or b. Wait, no.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, since p, q, r are primes, they are all greater than 1. Also, since the numerators and denominators are sums of squares and products of primes, they might be even or odd depending on the primes. But since primes are either 2 or odd, maybe that's a key point. Let me note that.\n\nLet me denote the three expressions as A, B, C respectively:\n\nA = (p² + 2q)/(q + r)\n\nB = (q² + 9r)/(r + p)\n\nC = (r² + 3p)/(p + q)\n\nAll of these must be natural numbers. So, for each of A, B, C, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can start by considering possible small primes for p, q, r. Since primes are 2 and odd, maybe starting with p=2, q=2, r=2 would be the simplest case. Let's check that.\n\nIf p=2, q=2, r=2:\n\nA = (4 + 4)/(2 + 2) = 8/4 = 2, which is natural.

Therefore, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\cdot (\\ln x + 1) \\). \n\nSo, \\( f'(x) = x^x (\\ln x + 1) \\). \n\nTo find the critical points, set \\( f'(x) = 0 \\). So, \\( x^x (\\ln x + 1) = 0 \\). Since \\( x^x \\) is always positive for \\( x > 0 \\), the only way this product can be zero is if \\( \\ln x + 1 = 0 \\). \n\nSolving \\( \\ln x + 1 = 0 \\), we get \\( \\ln x = -1 \\), so \\( x = e^{-1} = 1/e \\). \n\nTherefore, the critical point is at \\( x = 1/e \\). \n\nNow, to confirm that this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative or analyze the behavior around this point. Let's compute the second derivative to check concavity. \n\nFirst, let's compute \\( f''(x) \\). \n\nWe have \\( f'(x) = x^x (\\ln x + 1) \\). Let's differentiate this again. \n\nUsing the product rule: \\( f''(x) = [x^x (\\ln x + 1)]' \\). \n\nThe derivative of \\( x^x \\) is \\( x^x (\\ln x + 1) \\), as we found earlier. The derivative of \\( \\ln x + 1 \\) is \\( 1/x \\). \n\nSo, \\( f''(x) = x^x (\\ln x + 1)^2 + x^x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\). \n\nSimplify that: \\( f''(x) = x^x [ (\\ln x + 1)^2 + 1/x ] \\). \n\nSince \\( x^x \\) is always positive, the sign of \\( f''(x) \\) depends on the expression inside the brackets. \n\nLet's analyze \\( (\\ln x + 1)^2 + 1/x \\). \n\nSince \\( (\\ln x + 1)^2 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 1/x > 0 \\) for \\( x > 0 \\), the entire expression is positive. Therefore, \\( f''(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x > 0 \\). \n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(x) \\) is convex (since the second derivative is positive), which means that the critical point at \\( x = 1/e \\) is a local minimum. \n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the minimum of \\( f(x) \\). Since the function is convex, the critical point is indeed the global minimum. \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( f(1/e) \\). \n\nLet's compute that. \n\n\\( f(1/e) = (1/e)^{1/e} \\). \n\nSo, the minimum value is \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to see this. Let's consider the function \\( f(x) = x^x \\). \n\nTake the natural logarithm: \\( \\ln f(x) = x \\ln x \\). \n\nSo, \\( \\ln f(x) = x \\ln x \\). \n\nLet me see if I can find the maximum of \\( \\ln f(x) \\), which would correspond to the minimum of \\( f(x) \\). \n\nTo find the maximum of \\( \\ln f(x) \\), take its derivative: \\( \\frac{d}{dx} [x \\ln x] = \\ln x + 1 \\). \n\nSet this equal to zero: \\( \\ln x + 1 = 0 \\), so \\( x = 1/e \\). \n\nThen, the maximum of \\( \\ln f(x) \\) is at \\( x = 1/e \\), so the minimum of \\( f(x) \\) is at \\( x = 1/e \\). \n\nTherefore, the minimum value is \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider the function \\( f(x) = x^x \\). \n\nWe can write \\( f(x) = e^{x \\ln x} \\). \n\nBut maybe using the AM-GM inequality? Let's see. \n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. \n\nBut how does that apply here? Let's see. \n\nSuppose we take the numbers \\( x \\) and \\( 1 \\). Then, the arithmetic mean is \\( (x + 1)/2 \\), and the geometric mean is \\( \\sqrt{x} \\). \n\nBut maybe not directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, consider the function \\( f(x) = x^x \\). Let's take the logarithm to simplify. \n\nBut maybe another substitution. Let me set \\( y = \\ln x \\), so \\( x = e^y \\). Then, \\( f(x) = (e^y)^{e^y} = e^{y e^y} \\). \n\nSo, in terms of \\( y \\), the function becomes \\( e^{y e^y} \\). \n\nBut this might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the function \\( f(x) = x^x \\). \n\nWe can write \\( f(x) = e^{x \\ln x} \\). \n\nBut maybe we can use the inequality \\( x \\ln x \\geq -1 \\) for all \\( x > 0 \\). \n\nWait, let's check that. \n\nThe function \\( g(x) = x \\ln x \\) has a minimum at \\( x = 1/e \\), where \\( g(1/e) = (1/e) \\ln(1/e) = (1/e)(-1) = -1/e \\). \n\nTherefore, \\( x \\ln x \\geq -1/e \\) for all \\( x > 0 \\). \n\nTherefore, \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\geq e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nYes, that's another way to see it. \n\nSo, both approaches lead to the same conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) = x^x \\) is \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. \n\nFirst, we rewrote the function using exponentials. Then, we took the derivative, set it to zero, and solved for \\( x \\). \n\nWe found that the critical point is at \\( x = 1/e \\). \n\nThen, we checked the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum. \n\nAlternatively, we considered the logarithm of the function to simplify the analysis, leading to the same conclusion. \n\nBoth methods confirm that the minimum value is \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key steps were correctly applying the chain rule for differentiation, solving the equation for the critical point, and verifying the nature of the critical point through the second derivative. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the minimum value is indeed \\( e^{-1/e} \\). \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum value of the function \\( f(x) = x^x \\) is \\(\\boxed{e^{-1/e}}\\).\n</think>\nSo I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

Let's start with the first one.\n\n**Question 1:** With two disks of radius r < 1, is it possible to cover the unit disk D?\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the problem. The unit disk D has a radius of 1, so its diameter is 2. The two smaller disks each have radius r, so their diameters are 2r. The question is whether two such disks can cover the entire unit disk.\n\nTo cover the unit disk, every point in D must be within the union of the two smaller disks. So, the two smaller disks must overlap in such a way that their combined coverage includes every point in the unit disk.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange two disks of radius r to cover the unit disk. The key idea here is that the two disks must be positioned such that their union includes all points from -1 to 1 on the x-axis and similarly for the y-axis. Wait, but the unit disk is a circle, so maybe the disks need to be arranged in a way that their centers are positioned such that their combined coverage spans the entire unit disk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two disks are placed such that their centers are along the diameter of the unit disk, and their radii are chosen such that their union covers the entire disk. Let me try to model this.\n\nSuppose we place the centers of the two disks along the x-axis, symmetrically with respect to the origin. Let's say the centers are at (-a, 0) and (a, 0), where a is some positive number. The radius of each disk is r. Then, the distance between the centers is 2a. The union of the two disks will cover the region between the two disks. To cover the entire unit disk, the distance between the centers must be such that the union of the two disks extends from -1 to 1 on the x-axis. Wait, but the unit disk is centered at the origin, so the distance between the centers of the two disks must be at least 2, so that their union covers the entire disk. But if the centers are at (-a, 0) and (a, 0), then the distance between them is 2a. If we set 2a ≥ 2, then a ≥ 1. But if a ≥ 1, then the centers are at least 1 unit apart, which would mean that the union of the two disks would cover the entire unit disk. But wait, the radius of each disk is r < 1. If the centers are at least 1 unit apart, then the distance between the centers is at least 1, but the radius of each disk is less than 1. So, the union of the two disks would cover the region between the two disks, but the unit disk is centered at the origin. If the centers are at (-a, 0) and (a, 0), then the distance from the origin to each center is a. If a ≥ 1, then the distance from the origin to each center is at least 1, but the radius of each disk is less than 1. Therefore, the union of the two disks would cover the region between the two disks, but the unit disk is centered at the origin. If a ≥ 1, then the distance from the origin to each center is at least 1, but the radius of each disk is less than 1.

{"original_question": "Quelle est la somme de tous les nombres dont l’écriture décimale est une suite strictement croissante ou strictement décroissante de chiffres ?", "question": "Quelle est la somme de tous les nombres dont l’écriture décimale est une suite strictement croissante ou strictement décroissante de chiffres ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of all numbers where the decimal digits form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a strictly increasing or decreasing sequence means. For a number, the digits must be in either increasing or decreasing order. For example, 1234 is strictly increasing, and 4321 is strictly decreasing. But numbers can't have leading zeros, right? So, for example, 0123 is invalid because the first digit is zero. So, the numbers we're talking about can't have leading zeros. So, the first digit must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to find all such numbers (with no leading zeros) and sum them up. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible lengths of these numbers. The smallest possible number is 1, which is a single-digit number. Then, two-digit numbers, three-digit numbers, etc. But since the digits must be strictly increasing or decreasing, the maximum possible length is limited. For example, a strictly increasing sequence of digits can't have more than 9 digits because once you reach 9, the next digit would have to be 10, which is invalid. Similarly, a strictly decreasing sequence can't have more than 9 digits either, because once you reach 0, the next digit would have to be negative, which is invalid. Wait, but actually, a strictly decreasing sequence can have digits from 9 down to 0, but since we can't have leading zeros, the first digit can't be 0. So, for example, 9876543210 is a valid decreasing sequence, but 0987654321 is invalid because the first digit is 0. So, the maximum length for a strictly decreasing sequence is 10 digits (0987654321). Similarly, the maximum length for a strictly increasing sequence is 9 digits (123456789).\n\nBut how do we find all such numbers and sum them up? Let's think about generating all possible numbers with strictly increasing or decreasing digits and then summing them.\n\nFirst, let's handle the strictly increasing sequences. For a strictly increasing sequence, each digit must be greater than the previous one. So, for example, 1234 is a valid number. The number of such numbers with exactly k digits is equal to the number of combinations of k digits chosen from 1 to 9 (since the first digit can't be 0, but in a strictly increasing sequence, the first digit can be 1, 2, ..., 9). Wait, actually, the first digit can be from 1 to 9, and the rest are chosen in increasing order. So, for a strictly increasing sequence of length k, the number of such numbers is C(9, k), where C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time. Because we need to choose k distinct digits from 1 to 9, and arrange them in increasing order. So, for example, for k=2, the number of such numbers is C(9,2) = 36. Similarly, for k=3, it's C(9,3) = 84, and so on, up to k=9, which is C(9,9) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for strictly decreasing sequences, each digit must be less than the previous one. The first digit can be from 1 to 9, and the rest are chosen in decreasing order. So, for a strictly decreasing sequence of length k, the number of such numbers is also C(9, k). Because we need to choose k distinct digits from 1 to 9, and arrange them in decreasing order. So, for example, for k=2, the number of such numbers is C(9,2) = 36. For k=3, it's C(9,3) = 84, and so on, up to k=9, which is C(9,9) = 1.\n\nSo, the total number of strictly increasing numbers is the sum of C(9,1) + C(9,2) + ... + C(9,9) = 2^9 - 1 = 511. Similarly, the total number of strictly decreasing numbers is also 511, because C(9,1) + C(9,2) + ... + C(9,9) = 2^9 - 1. Wait, but actually, the sum of C(9,1) + C(9,2) + ... + C(9,9) is equal to 2^9 - 1, but that's the total number of non-empty subsets of a 9-element set, which is 511. But in our case, we are considering sequences of length 1 to 9, so the total number of strictly increasing or decreasing sequences is 2*(sum_{k=1}^9 C(9,k)) = 2*(2^9 - 1) = 2*(511) = 1022. Wait, but that's the total number of strictly increasing or decreasing sequences. But each such sequence corresponds to a number, so the sum of all these numbers is 1022 times the average of all these numbers. But actually, the sum of all these numbers is equal to the sum of all strictly increasing numbers plus the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers. So, if we can compute the sum of all strictly increasing numbers and the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers, then the total sum is 2*(sum of strictly increasing numbers) = 2*(sum of strictly decreasing numbers). Wait, no. Wait, the sum of all strictly increasing numbers is equal to the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers. Because for each strictly increasing number, there's a corresponding strictly decreasing number by reversing the digits. For example, 123 is a strictly increasing number, and 321 is a strictly decreasing number. So, the sum of all strictly increasing numbers is equal to the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers. Therefore, the total sum is 2*(sum of strictly increasing numbers). So, if we can compute the sum of all strictly increasing numbers, then the total sum is 2*(sum of strictly increasing numbers). So, the problem reduces to finding the sum of all strictly increasing numbers and then multiplying by 2.\n\nBut how do we compute the sum of all strictly increasing numbers? Let's think about how to compute that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sum of all strictly increasing numbers of a certain length. For example, the sum of all 1-digit strictly increasing numbers is 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45. The sum of all 2-digit strictly increasing numbers. For each possible first digit (1-9), the second digit can be any digit from the first digit +1 up to 9. So, for first digit 1, the second digit can be 2-9 (8 possibilities). For first digit 2, the second digit can be 3-9 (7 possibilities), and so on. So, the sum of all 2-digit strictly increasing numbers is the sum over first digit d from 1 to 8 of d * sum_{k=d+1}^9 k. Wait, no. Wait, for each first digit d, the second digit can be from d+1 to 9. So, for each first digit d, the number of possible second digits is (9 - d). So, the sum for first digit d is d * sum_{k=d+1}^9 k. Therefore, the total sum for 2-digit numbers is sum_{d=1}^8 d * sum_{k=d+1}^9 k. Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute the sum of k from d+1 to 9 for each d. For d=1, sum is 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44. For d=2, sum is 3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44 - 2 = 42. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFor d=1: sum from 2 to 9 is 44.\n\nFor d=2: sum from 3 to 9 is 42.\n\nFor d=3: sum from 4 to 9 is 39.\n\nFor d=4: sum from 5 to 9 is 36.\n\nFor d=5: sum from 6 to 9 is 33.\n\nFor d=6: sum from 7 to 9 is 30.\n\nFor d=7: sum from 8 to 9 is 18.\n\nFor d=8: sum from 9 to 9 is 9.\n\nSo, the total sum for 2-digit numbers is 1*44 + 2*42 + 3*39 + 4*36 + 5*33 + 6*30 + 7*18 + 8*9.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1*44 = 44\n\n2*42 = 84\n\n3*39 = 117\n\n4*36 = 144\n\n5*33 = 165\n\n6*30 = 180\n\n7*18 = 126\n\n8*9 = 72\n\nTotal sum = 44 + 84 + 117 + 144 + 165 + 180 + 126 + 72 = 44 + 84 = 128; 128 + 117 = 245; 245 + 144 = 389; 389 + 165 = 554; 554 + 180 = 734; 734 + 126 = 860; 860 + 72 = 932.\n\nSo, the sum of all 2-digit strictly increasing numbers is 932.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of all 3-digit strictly increasing numbers. For each first digit d from 1 to 7, the second digit can be from d+1 to 9, and the third digit can be from the second digit +1 to 9. So, for each first digit d, the number of possible second digits is (9 - d), and for each second digit k, the number of possible third digits is (9 - k). So, the sum for first digit d is d * sum_{k=d+1}^9 (k * (9 - k)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each first digit d, the second digit can be from d+1 to 9, and for each second digit k, the third digit can be from k+1 to 9. So, for each first digit d, the number of possible second digits is (9 - d), and for each second digit k, the number of possible third digits is (9 - k). So, the sum for first digit d is d * sum_{k=d+1}^9 [k * (9 - k)]. Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute the sum for each d:\n\nFor d=1: sum_{k=2}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 2*7 + 3*6 + 4*5 + 5*4 + 6*3 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 14 + 18 + 20 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 14 + 18 = 32; 32 + 20 = 52; 52 + 20 = 72; 72 + 18 = 90; 90 + 14 = 104; 104 + 8 = 112; 112 + 0 = 112.\n\nFor d=2: sum_{k=3}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 3*6 + 4*5 + 5*4 + 6*3 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 18 + 20 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 18 + 20 = 38; 38 + 20 = 58; 58 + 18 = 76; 76 + 14 = 90; 90 + 8 = 98; 98 + 0 = 98.\n\nFor d=3: sum_{k=4}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 4*5 + 5*4 + 6*3 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 20 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 20 + 20 = 40; 40 + 18 = 58; 58 + 14 = 72; 72 + 8 = 80; 80 + 0 = 80.\n\nFor d=4: sum_{k=5}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 5*4 + 6*3 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 20 + 18 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 20 + 18 = 38; 38 + 14 = 52; 52 + 8 = 60; 60 + 0 = 60.\n\nFor d=5: sum_{k=6}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 6*3 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 18 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 18 + 14 = 32; 32 + 8 = 40; 40 + 0 = 40.\n\nFor d=6: sum_{k=7}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 7*2 + 8*1 + 9*0 = 14 + 8 + 0 = 22.\n\nFor d=7: sum_{k=8}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 8*1 + 9*0 = 8 + 0 = 8.\n\nFor d=8: sum_{k=9}^9 (k*(9 - k)) = 9*0 = 0.\n\nSo, the total sum for 3-digit strictly increasing numbers is:\n\n1*112 + 2*98 + 3*80 + 4*60 + 5*40 + ", "answer": "Commençons par remarquer que ces nombres s’écrivant dans le système décimal avec au plus $9$ chiffres (cas croissant) ou $10$ chiffres (cas décroissant), car le chiffre le plus à gauche ne peut être $0$. \n\nUne idée est de faire correspondre à chaque nombre $a$ s’écrivant avec $k$ chiffres en ordre croissant un nombre $b$ dont les chiffres, en ordre décroissant, seraient les compléments à $9$ des chiffres de $a$ (cela ferait des sommes deux à deux ne s’écrivant qu’avec des $9$).

{"original_question": "Quelles sont les valeurs de \\( a \\) pour lesquelles l’équation  \n\\[ x^3 + ax - 2(a + 4) = 0 \\]  \nPossède exactement deux solutions réelles ?", "question": "Quelles sont les valeurs de \\( a \\) pour lesquelles l’équation  \n\\[ x^3 + ax - 2(a + 4) = 0 \\]  \nPossède exactement deux solutions réelles ?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the values of \\( a \\) for which the equation \\( x^3 + ax - 2(a + 4) = 0 \\) has exactly two real solutions. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that a cubic equation can have either one or three real roots. The number of real roots depends on the number of times the graph of the function crosses the x-axis. So, if there are exactly two real roots, that means the graph crosses the x-axis twice, which would imply that there's one local maximum and one local minimum, and the function goes from negative infinity to positive infinity, crossing the x-axis twice. \n\nSo, maybe I need to analyze the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + ax - 2(a + 4) \\). Let me compute its derivative to find the critical points. The derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is \\( 3x^2 + a \\). Setting this equal to zero gives \\( 3x^2 + a = 0 \\), so \\( x^2 = -a/3 \\). \n\nFor real solutions, the right-hand side must be non-negative, so \\( -a/3 \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( a \\leq 0 \\). So, if \\( a > 0 \\), there are no critical points, meaning the function is either always increasing or always decreasing. If \\( a = 0 \\), then the derivative is \\( 3x^2 \\), which is always non-negative, so the function is always increasing. If \\( a < 0 \\), then the critical points are at \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/3} \\). \n\nSo, depending on the value of \\( a \\), the function can have different behaviors. Let me consider each case.\n\nCase 1: \\( a > 0 \\). Then the function is always increasing. So, it can have at most one real root. Therefore, it can't have exactly two real roots. So, no solutions here.\n\nCase 2: \\( a = 0 \\). Then the function is \\( x^3 - 8 \\). This is a cubic function that goes from negative infinity to positive infinity. It crosses the x-axis once. So, only one real root. Not two. So, no solutions here.\n\nCase 3: \\( a < 0 \\). Then the function has two critical points at \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/3} \\). Let me denote \\( c = \\sqrt{-a/3} \\), so the critical points are at \\( x = \\pm c \\). \n\nNow, I need to analyze the behavior of the function around these critical points. Let's compute the second derivative to determine the concavity. The second derivative \\( f''(x) = 6x \\). \n\nAt \\( x = c \\), the second derivative is \\( 6c \\). Since \\( c = \\sqrt{-a/3} \\), which is positive (because \\( a < 0 \\)), so \\( 6c \\) is positive. Therefore, the function is concave up at \\( x = c \\). Similarly, at \\( x = -c \\), the second derivative is \\( -6c \\), which is negative. So, the function is concave down at \\( x = -c \\). \n\nTherefore, the function has a local minimum at \\( x = c \\) and a local maximum at \\( x = -c \\). \n\nSo, the function goes from negative infinity to the local maximum at \\( x = -c \\), then to the local minimum at \\( x = c \\), then to positive infinity. \n\nTo have exactly two real roots, the function must cross the x-axis twice. This can happen in two ways: either the local maximum is above the x-axis and the local minimum is below, or vice versa. \n\nBut since the function goes from negative infinity to positive infinity, the local maximum must be above the x-axis, and the local minimum must be below the x-axis. Otherwise, if the local maximum is below or the local minimum is above, the function might not cross the x-axis twice. \n\nSo, let's compute the values of the function at the critical points. \n\nFirst, compute \\( f(-c) \\):  \n\\( f(-c) = (-c)^3 + a(-c) - 2(a + 4) \\)  \n= \\( -c^3 - ac - 2a - 8 \\)  \n= \\( -c^3 - a(c + 2) - 8 \\)  \nBut since \\( c = \\sqrt{-a/3} \\), so \\( c^3 = (\\sqrt{-a/3})^3 = (-a/3)^{3/2} \\). Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let me compute \\( f(-c) \\) in terms of \\( a \\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( f(-c) \\) and \\( f(c) \\) in terms of \\( a \\). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of the function's behavior. \n\nSince the function is increasing from negative infinity to \\( x = -c \\), then decreasing to \\( x = c \\), then increasing to positive infinity. \n\nSo, the function starts at negative infinity, rises to a local maximum at \\( x = -c \\), then falls to a local minimum at \\( x = c \\), then rises to positive infinity. \n\nTherefore, the function will cross the x-axis twice if the local maximum is above the x-axis and the local minimum is below. \n\nSo, we need \\( f(-c) > 0 \\) and \\( f(c) < 0 \\). \n\nLet me compute \\( f(-c) \\):  \n\\( f(-c) = (-c)^3 + a(-c) - 2(a + 4) \\)  \n= \\( -c^3 - ac - 2a - 8 \\)  \n= \\( -c^3 - a(c + 2) - 8 \\)  \nBut \\( c = \\sqrt{-a/3} \\), so \\( c^3 = (\\sqrt{-a/3})^3 = (-a/3)^{3/2} \\).

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the solutions are integers if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. The discriminant for the first equation is \\( m^2 - 4n \\), and for the second equation, it's \\( n^2 - 4m \\). Both discriminants must be perfect squares, right? So, we have:\n\n1. \\( m^2 - 4n = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\)\n2. \\( n^2 - 4m = l^2 \\) for some integer \\( l \\)\n\nAdditionally, at least one of the equations must have at least one integer solution. So, either the first equation has an integer solution, or the second equation has an integer solution, or both.\n\nLet me start by considering possible values for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). Since they are natural numbers, they are at least 1. Let's think about small values first.\n\nSuppose \\( m = 1 \\). Then the first equation becomes \\( x^2 + x + n = 0 \\). The discriminant is \\( 1 - 4n \\). For this to be a perfect square, \\( 1 - 4n = k^2 \\). So, \\( 4n = 1 - k^2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a natural number, \\( 1 - k^2 \\) must be positive, so \\( k^2 < 1 \\). The only integer \\( k \\) satisfying this is \\( k = 0 \\), which gives \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be a natural number, so \\( k = 0 \\) is invalid here. Therefore, \\( m = 1 \\) is not possible.\n\nNext, let's try \\( m = 2 \\). Then the first equation is \\( x^2 + 2x + n = 0 \\). The discriminant is \\( 4 - 4n = 4(1 - n) \\). For this to be a perfect square, \\( 1 - n \\) must be a perfect square. Let's denote \\( 1 - n = t^2 \\), so \\( n = 1 - t^2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a natural number, \\( 1 - t^2 \\geq 1 \\), which implies \\( t^2 \\leq 0 \\). The only integer solution is \\( t = 0 \\), leading to \\( n = 1 \\).

Since \\( n \\) is a natural number, \\( 9 - k^2 \\) must be positive, so \\( k^2 < 9 \\). Possible \\( k \\) values are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let's check each:\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( 4n = 9 \\), so \\( n = 9/4 \\), not integer.\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 4n = 8 \\), so \\( n = 2 \\). Then, check the second equation: \\( x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \\).

Let me start by recalling what a polynomial of degree two is. A quadratic polynomial can be written in the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, and a ≠ 0. Since it's a unitary polynomial, the coefficient of x² is 1, so a = 1. Therefore, P(x) = x² + bx + c.\n\nThe problem states that P(1) = 0 and P(2) = 0. So, substituting x = 1 into the polynomial gives 1 + b + c = 0. Similarly, substituting x = 2 gives 4 + 2b + c = 0. Now, I have two equations:\n\n1. 1 + b + c = 0\n2. 4 + 2b + c = 0\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find the values of b and c. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: 1 + b + c = 0\nEquation 2: 4 + 2b + c = 0\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate c. Let's try that.\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(4 + 2b + c) - (1 + b + c) = 0 - 0\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n4 - 1 + 2b - b + c - c = 3 + b = 0\n\nSo, 3 + b = 0 => b = -3\n\nOkay, that gives me the value of b. Now, substitute b = -3 back into one of the original equations to find c. Let's use Equation 1:\n\n1 + (-3) + c = 0 => 1 - 3 + c = 0 => -2 + c = 0 => c = 2\n\nSo, c = 2. Therefore, the polynomial P(x) is x² - 3x + 2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I plug in x = 1: 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. Correct. And x = 2: 4 - 6 + 2 = 0. Correct. So that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify once more. Let's write out the polynomial again: P(x) = x² - 3x + 2. Let's check if it's a unitary polynomial. The coefficient of x² is 1, which is correct. Then, the roots are x = 1 and x = 2, which are the solutions to P(x) = 0. So, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the polynomial to see if that gives the same result. Let's factor x² - 3x + 2. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 (the constant term) and add to -3 (the coefficient of x). The numbers -1 and -2 satisfy that: (-1)(-2) = 2 and -1 + (-2) = -3. So, the polynomial factors as (x - 1)(x - 2). Therefore, the roots are indeed x = 1 and x = 2, which matches the given conditions.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts about harmonic series. The harmonic series is the sum of reciprocals of natural numbers, which is known to diverge, but I need to find an upper bound for the partial sum up to 2020. \n\nFirst, I remember that the harmonic series can be approximated using the natural logarithm. Specifically, the sum from 1 to n of 1/k is approximately ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.5772). But since we need an upper bound, maybe we can use the integral test. The integral test tells us that the sum from 1 to n of 1/k is less than the integral from 1 to n+1 of 1/x dx, which is ln(n+1). Similarly, the sum is greater than the integral from 1 to n of 1/x dx, which is ln(n). So, the sum from 1 to n is between ln(n) and ln(n+1). \n\nBut since we need an upper bound, maybe we can use the integral from 1 to n+1 of 1/x dx, which is ln(n+1). So, the sum from 1 to n is less than ln(n+1). But wait, the problem is asking for the sum to be greater than 13/2, which is 6.5. So, if I can show that ln(2021) > 6.5, then that would be sufficient. Let me check that. \n\nCalculating ln(2021). Let me see, 2021 is between e^6 and e^7. e^6 is approximately 403.43, and e^7 is about 1096.5. So, 2021 is between e^6 and e^7, so ln(2021) is between 6 and 7. But 6.5 is between 6 and 7, so if ln(2021) is greater than 6.5, then the sum is greater than 6.5. So, if I can show that ln(2021) > 6.5, then the sum is greater than 6.5. \n\nBut how do I compute ln(2021)? Let me see. 2021 is 2000 + 21. Let's approximate ln(2021). Since ln(2000) is ln(2*10^3) = ln(2) + 3*ln(10). ln(2) is approximately 0.693, and ln(10) is approximately 2.302. So, ln(2000) ≈ 0.693 + 3*2.302 ≈ 0.693 + 6.906 ≈ 7.599. Then, ln(2021) ≈ 7.599 + ln(21). ln(21) is approximately 3.044. So, total ln(2021) ≈ 7.599 + 3.044 ≈ 10.643. That's way more than 6.5. So, ln(2021) is definitely greater than 6.5. Therefore, the sum from 1 to 2020 is less than ln(2021) ≈ 10.643, which is definitely greater than 6.5. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking to prove that the sum is greater than 13/2, which is 6.5. So, if the sum is less than 10.643, which is greater than 6.5, then the sum is definitely greater than 6.5. Therefore, the inequality holds. \n\nBut let me check if there's a more precise way to approach this. Maybe using the integral test more carefully. The integral test tells us that the sum from 1 to n of 1/k is between ln(n) and ln(n+1). So, the sum is less than ln(n+1). Therefore, if we can show that ln(2021) > 6.5, then the sum is greater than 6.5. \n\nBut let's verify that 6.5 is indeed less than ln(2021). Let's compute ln(2021). Let me use a calculator. ln(2021) ≈ 7.612. So, 7.612 is greater than 6.5. Therefore, the sum is less than 7.612, which is certainly greater than 6.5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approximate ln(2021). Let me try using the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + x). Since 2021 is 2020 + 1, and 2020 is 2020, so ln(2021) = ln(2020) + ln(1 + 1/2020). But ln(2020) is approximately ln(2000) + ln(1 + 0.005). ln(2000) is ln(2) + 3 ln(10) ≈ 0.693 + 6.906 = 7.599. Then, ln(1 + 0.005) ≈ 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 - ... ≈ 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.00000004166... ≈ 0.0049875. So, ln(2021) ≈ 7.599 + 0.0049875 ≈ 7.60375. So, that's still greater than 6.5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the integral test more precisely. The integral from 1 to n of 1/x dx is ln(n). So, the sum from 1 to n is between ln(n) and ln(n+1). Therefore, the sum is less than ln(n+1). Therefore, if we can show that ln(n+1) > 13/2, then the sum is greater than 13/2. \n\nSo, let's compute ln(13/2). 13/2 is 6.5. So, we need to show that ln(13/2) < ln(n+1). Therefore, 13/2 < n+1, so n > 13/2 - 1 = 11/2 = 5.5. Since n is an integer, n ≥ 6. But we need to show that the sum is greater than 13/2, which is 6.5. \n\nBut wait, if we can show that the sum is greater than 6.5, then it's certainly greater than 13/2. But maybe there's a better way. Let me check the sum from 1 to 2020. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the integral test with a different approach. Let's consider the integral from 1 to 2020 of 1/x dx, which is ln(2020). Then, the sum from 1 to 2020 is between ln(2020) and ln(2021). So, if we can show that ln(2020) > 13/2, then the sum is greater than 13/2. \n\nBut ln(2020) is approximately 7.612, which is greater than 6.5. So, that's sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the sum from 1 to n is approximately ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. So, ln(2020) ≈ 7.612, which is greater than 6.5. Therefore, the sum is greater than 6.5. \n\nBut let me check if there's a more precise way. Let's compute ln(2020). Let's use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + x). Since 2020 is 2020, so ln(2020) = ln(2000) + ln(1 + 0.005). ln(2000) = ln(2*10^3) = ln(2) + 3 ln(10) ≈ 0.693 + 6.906 = 7.599. Then, ln(1 + 0.005) ≈ 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 - ... ≈ 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.00000004166... ≈ 0.0049875. So, ln(2020) ≈ 7.599 + 0.0049875 ≈ 7.60375. So, that's still greater than 6.5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the integral test with a different approach. Let's consider the integral from 1 to 2020 of 1/x dx, which is ln(2020). Then, the sum from 1 to 2020 is between ln(2020) and ln(2021).

The problem is about buying canelés with different capacities: 6, 9, 12, and 16. We need to figure out if we can buy 10, 20, and 30 canelés. Hmm, so the question is whether these numbers can be expressed as combinations of 6, 9, 12, and 16. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with combinations of numbers, especially if they are multiples, maybe we can use the concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). Let me check the GCD of 6, 9, 12, and 16. \n\nCalculating the GCD step by step:\n- GCD(6, 9) is 3.\n- Then GCD(3, 12) is 3.\n- Finally, GCD(3, 16) is 1. So the GCD is 1. That means that any number that can be formed by these numbers must be a multiple of 1, which is trivial. But that doesn't directly help us here. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is about the set {6, 9, 12, 16} being a basis for some number. But the question is about combinations, not necessarily a basis.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is continuous on [0,1], which means it's smooth and doesn't have any jumps or breaks. The endpoints are both zero, so f(0) = f(1) = 0. The key condition is that for any x in [0, 7/10], the function values at x and x + 3/10 are different. So, if I take any x in [0, 7/10], moving 3/10 to the right, the function value changes. That seems like a kind of periodicity or something, but not exactly periodic because the interval isn't full. Wait, but maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose I start at x = 0. Then, moving 3/10 to the right, I get to x = 3/10. Since f(0) = f(1), maybe there's a point where f(x) = 0 again. But the condition says that f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x) for x in [0, 7/10]. So, starting at x = 0, moving 3/10 to x = 3/10, the function values are different. Then, moving another 3/10 to x = 6/10, the function values are different again. Then, moving another 3/10 to x = 9/10, which is beyond 1, but since the function is defined on [0,1], maybe we need to consider the function's behavior modulo 1. Wait, but the function is defined on [0,1], so x + 3/10 could be in [0,1] or [1,2], but since we're only considering x in [0,7/10], x + 3/10 would be in [3/10, 10/10] = [3/10,1]. So, for x in [0,7/10], x + 3/10 is in [3/10,1]. But since f is defined on [0,1], maybe we can consider the function's behavior on [0,1] and then extend it periodically? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention periodicity, just continuity. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) here. Since f is continuous and f(0) = f(1) = 0, there must be at least one zero in between. But the problem states \"at least seven solutions,\" so maybe there are multiple zeros.

But since f is continuous on [0,1], maybe we can consider the function's behavior on [0,1] and then extend it periodically? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention periodicity, just continuity. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Since f is continuous on [0,1], and f(0) = f(1) = 0, there must be at least one zero in between.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for each x in [0,7/10], f(x) ≠ f(x + 3/10). So, if we start at x = 0, then f(0) ≠ f(3/10). Then, moving to x = 3/10, f(3/10) ≠ f(6/10).
