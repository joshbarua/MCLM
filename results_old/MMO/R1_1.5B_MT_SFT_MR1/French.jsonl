Let me start by understanding the definition again. A natural number n is called pointu if it has at most one prime divisor (so it's a prime power) or, if it has two distinct prime divisors p and q, then p must be at least twice as large as q. For example, 25 is pointu because it has only one prime divisor (5), and 147 is pointu because its prime divisors are 3 and 7, and 7 is twice 3. But 105 isn't pointu because its prime divisors are 3, 5, and 7, and 7 is less than twice 5.\n\nNow, the first question is: Is 2020 a pointu number? Let's break down 2020. First, factorize it into primes. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then, 505 divided by 5 is 101, which is a prime. So 2020 factors into 2² × 5 × 101. The prime divisors here are 2, 5, and 101. Since there are three distinct prime divisors, the number of distinct primes is more than one. Now, we need to check if the largest prime divisor is at least twice the smallest one. The primes are 2, 5, and 101. The smallest prime is 2, the largest is 101. Is 101 ≥ 2×2? Yes, 101 is much larger than 4. But wait, but the definition says \"if, notating p and q as the two largest divisors of n, then p ≥ 2q\". Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, p and q are the two largest prime divisors? Or the two largest divisors? Wait, the example says p and q are the two largest divisors. For 147, the divisors are 3 and 7, so p=7 and q=3, and 7 ≥ 2×3. But the example says \"notating p and q as the two largest divisors\". So maybe p is the largest prime divisor and q is the second largest prime divisor? Wait, but 147 is 3×7², so the prime divisors are 3 and 7. So the two largest are 7 and 3. So p=7, q=3. Then p ≥ 2q? 7 ≥ 6, which is true. So the condition is that the largest prime divisor is at least twice the second largest. Wait, but how does that work if there are more than two prime divisors? For example, 105 has prime divisors 3,5,7. The largest is 7, the second largest is 5. 7 < 2×5, so 105 is not pointu. So in this case, even though there are three primes, the largest is not twice the second. Therefore, the definition is that if there are two or more prime divisors, then the largest must be at least twice the second largest. So in the case of 147, it's two primes, so check if the largest is at least twice the second. If there's only one prime divisor, it's automatically pointu. So for 2020, which has three prime divisors, we need to check the largest prime divisor (101) against the second largest (5). 101 ≥ 2×5? 101 ≥ 10? Yes. But wait, but the example says \"notating p and q as the two largest divisors of n\". Wait, wait, maybe in the case of multiple prime divisors, they are referring to the two largest prime divisors? Wait, but in 2020, the prime divisors are 2,5,101. So the largest is 101, the second largest is 5. So p=101, q=5. Then is 101 ≥ 2×5? Yes. So if that's the case, then 2020 is pointu? But wait, the example says \"p and q are the two largest divisors of n\". Wait, in the definition, n is called pointu if it has at most one prime divisor or, if it has two or more, the largest prime divisor is at least twice the second largest. So in the case of 2020, which has three prime divisors, the largest is 101, the second largest is 5, and the third is 2. So according to the definition, since there are three primes, the largest (101) must be at least twice the second largest (5). 101 is indeed larger than 10, so 101 ≥ 10. So 2020 would be pointu. But wait, the example says 147 is pointu because 7 ≥ 2×3. So in that case, even though there are two primes, the largest is 7, the second is 3, 7 ≥ 2×3. So the rule is that if there are two prime divisors, check if the larger is at least twice the smaller. If there are more than two prime divisors, check if the largest is at least twice the second largest. So in the case of 2020, since it has three divisors, check if the largest (101) is at least twice the second largest (5). 101 ≥ 10, which is true. Therefore, 2020 is pointu. Wait, but the example says 2020 is pointu. So is that correct? Let me check. So 2020 is 2² × 5 × 101. So the prime factors are 2,5,101. The two largest prime divisors are 101 and 5. So 101 is the largest, 5 is the second. 101 ≥ 2×5 → 101 ≥ 10, which is true. Therefore, 2020 is pointu. So the answer to the first question is yes. But wait, let me check the definition again. The definition says \"if, notating p and q as the two largest divisors of n, then p ≥ 2q is verified\". Wait, maybe in the case of multiple divisors, but the problem says \"the two largest divisors of n\". So maybe p is the largest divisor, q is the second largest. Wait, but 2020's divisors are 1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020. So the two largest divisors are 2020 and 1010. Then p=2020, q=1010. Then p ≥ 2q? 2020 ≥ 2×1010 → 2020 ≥ 2020, which is true. Wait, but 2020 is the largest divisor, 1010 is the second largest. So 2020 ≥ 2×1010 → 2020 ≥ 2020, which is true. So maybe the definition is that if n has two or more divisors, then check if the largest divisor is at least twice the second largest. But in that case, for primes, the divisors are 1 and p, so the largest is p, second largest is 1, so p ≥ 2×1 → p ≥ 2. So primes are pointu. For composite numbers with two divisors (only composite numbers have two divisors, which are 1 and the number itself). Wait, so all composite numbers have at least three divisors. Wait, but 4 has divisors 1, 2, 4. So three divisors. Wait, so if a number has two divisors, it's prime. If it has three divisors, it's a square of a prime. If it has more divisors, like 6, which has divisors 1,2,3,6. So four divisors. So for numbers with two divisors (primes), check p ≥ 2q: p is the prime, q=1. So p ≥ 2×1 → p ≥ 2, which is true for all primes except 2. Wait, 2 is prime. The divisors are 1 and 2. So p=2, q=1. 2 ≥ 2×1 → 2 ≥ 2, which is true. So primes are pointu. For composite numbers with three divisors, which are squares of primes (like 4=2²), divisors are 1, p, p². So largest divisor is p², second largest is p. Check if p² ≥ 2p → p ≥ 2. So primes p ≥ 2. So 4 is pointu. For composite numbers with four divisors, like 6=2×3, divisors 1,2,3,6. Largest divisor is 6, second largest is 3. Check 6 ≥ 2×3 → 6 ≥ 6, which is true. So 6 is pointu. Wait, but 6 has four divisors, so p=6, q=3. 6 ≥ 2×3 → 6 ≥ 6, which is true. So 6 is pointu. So 12, which is 2²×3, divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Largest divisor is 12, second largest is 6. Check 12 ≥ 2×6 → 12 ≥ 12, true. So 12 is pointu. Wait, but the definition says that if you have two or more divisors, check if the largest is at least twice the second largest. So for numbers with exactly two divisors (primes), it's p ≥ 2×1, which is p ≥ 2, which is true for primes. For numbers with three divisors (squares of primes), check if the largest (p²) is ≥ 2×p, which is p ≥ 2. So primes p ≥ 2. For numbers with four divisors, check if the largest (n) is ≥ 2×(second largest). For example, 6: second largest is 3, so 6 ≥ 6, which is true. 8=2³ has divisors 1,2,4,8. largest is 8, second largest is 4. 8 ≥ 2×4 → 8 ≥ 8, which is true. So 8 is pointu. 16=2⁴: divisors 1,2,4,8,16. Check 16 ≥ 2×8 → 16 ≥ 16, true. So 16 is pointu. 12=2²×3: divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Largest is 12, second largest is 6. 12 ≥ 12, true. So 12 is pointu. So the rule seems to be that if a number has two or more divisors, then the largest divisor (n) is at least twice the second largest divisor. Wait, but for numbers with two divisors (primes), the second largest is 1, so the condition is n ≥ 2×1 → n ≥ 2, which is true. For numbers with three divisors (squares of primes), the second largest is p, so n = p². Check if p² ≥ 2p → p ≥ 2. So primes p ≥ 2. For numbers with four divisors, like 6, 8, 10, etc., check n ≥ 2×(second largest). For example, 6: second largest is 3, so 6 ≥ 6. 8: second largest is 4, 8 ≥ 8. 10: second largest is 5, 10 ≥ 10. So 10 is pointu. 14=2×7: divisors 1,2,7,14. Second largest is 7. Check 14 ≥ 2×7 → 14 ≥ 14, true. So 14 is pointu. 15=3×5: divisors 1,3,5,15. Second largest is 5. 15 ≥ 2×5 → 15 ≥ 10, true. So 15 is pointu. 21=3×7: divisors 1,3,7,21. Second largest is 7. 21 ≥ 14, true. 22=2×11: divisors 1,2,11,22. Second largest is 11. 22 ≥ 22, true. So 22 is pointu. 26=2×13: same as 22. 33=3×11: divisors 1,3,11,33. Second largest is 11. 33 ≥ 22, true. So 33 is pointu. 34=2×17: same as 2×17. 35=5×7: divisors 1,5,7,35. Second largest is 7. 35 ≥ 14, true. So 35 is pointu. 38=2×19: same. 39=3×13: same. 46=2×23: same. 49=7²: divisors 1,7,49. Second largest is 7. 49 ≥ 14, true. So 49 is pointu. 50=2×5²: divisors 1,2,5,10,25,50. Second largest is 25. 50 ≥ 50, true. So 50 is pointu. So the rule seems to be that if a number has two or more divisors, then check if the largest divisor is at least twice the second largest. For primes, this is true (p ≥ 2×1). For composite numbers with three divisors (squares of primes), check if p² ≥ 2p → p ≥ 2. For numbers with four divisors, check if n ≥ 2×k, where k is the second largest divisor. For example, 6: second largest is 3, so 6 ≥ 6. 8: second largest is 4, so 8 ≥ 8.

Let me start by understanding what v(n) represents. The problem says v(n) is the largest natural number k such that n divided by 2^k is an integer. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Wait, isn't that the same as the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides n? So, for example, if n is even, v(n) would be the number of times you can divide n by 2 before it becomes odd. For instance, if n is 8, then v(8) would be 3 because 8 divided by 2 three times gives 1, which is odd. But if n is 12, which is 4*3, then v(12) would be 2 because 12 divided by 2 twice is 3, which is still divisible by 2 once, but 3 is odd. Wait, actually, no. Wait, 12 divided by 2 is 6, then again by 2 is 3. So, the highest power of 2 that divides 12 is 2^2, so v(12) should be 2. Yeah, that makes sense. So v(n) is the 2-adic valuation of n. So, for any n ≥ 1, v(n) is the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n. So, for example, v(1) would be 0 because 1 is not divisible by 2. v(2) is 1, v(3) is 0, v(4) is 2, v(5) is 0, and so on. So, the problem is asking for v(1) to v(4). Let me verify that.\n\nFirst, let's confirm with n=1. Since n=1, 1 divided by 2^0 is 1, which is an integer, and 2^1 is 2, which doesn't divide 1. So the largest k is 0, so v(1)=0. That seems right.\n\nn=2: 2 divided by 2^1 is 1, which is integer. 2^2 is 4, which doesn't divide 2. So v(2)=1.\n\nn=3: 3 divided by 2^0 is 3, which is integer. 2^1 is 2, which doesn't divide 3. So v(3)=0.\n\nn=4: 4 divided by 2^2 is 1, which is integer. 2^3 is 8, which doesn't divide 4. So v(4)=2.\n\nSo, the values are straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't misread the problem. The problem defines v(n) as the largest natural number k such that n/(2^k) is integer. So yes, exactly the 2-adic valuation. Therefore, for n=1, the exponent k is 0. For n=2, k=1. For n=3, k=0. For n=4, k=2. So, the answer should be v(1)=0, v(2)=1, v(3)=0, v(4)=2. Let me check again.\n\nWait, but the recurrence relation is defined for the sequence u_n. Maybe the problem is testing the understanding of v(n) through the recurrence? Let's see. The problem says: \"Given the integer sequence (u_n) defined by recursion: u₁ = 1 and for each integer n ≥ 2 : uₙ = [if uₙ₋₁=0, then 0, else 1 + 2v(n) - 1/uₙ₋₁].\"\n\nSo, the problem is not directly asking for v(1) to v(4), but perhaps the sequence u_n is defined in terms of v(n). But the question is to provide the values of v(1), v(2), v(3), v(4). Since each of these is just the 2-adic valuation, and the examples for 1,2,3,4 are straightforward, maybe the answer is straightforward. But let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a trick here. Let me see. The sequence u_n is defined with a recurrence relation that depends on v(n). But maybe the problem is just testing the knowledge of v(n) as the 2-adic valuation. Since the question is to compute v(1), v(2), v(3), v(4), which are each the exponents of the highest power of 2 dividing the numbers 1,2,3,4 respectively. So, as we have:\n\n- 1 is 2^0 * 1, so v(1)=0\n- 2 is 2^1 * 1, so v(2)=1\n- 3 is 2^0 * 3, so v(3)=0\n- 4 is 2^2 * 1, so v(4)=2\n\nTherefore, the values are 0,1,0,2. So, unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement, perhaps the answer is straightforward. But let me check again the definition of v(n). The problem says v(n) is the largest natural number k such that n/(2^k) is integer. So yes, that's exactly the 2-adic valuation. So, for each n, we factor out the highest power of 2, and the exponent is k, so v(n)=k. Therefore, the values are as above. So, the answer should be v(1)=0, v(2)=1, v(3)=0, v(4)=2.\n\nBut maybe there is a step-by-step process expected here, even though it's straightforward. Let me try to simulate the sequence u_n to see if there's a pattern or if the values of v(n) are indeed determined by the recurrence. But since the problem is only asking for v(1) to v(4), maybe that's all that's needed. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, confirm v(1):\n\nu₁ = 1. Then, for n=1, since u₁=1≠0, so u₂ = 1 + 2v(1) - 1/u₁. But wait, hold on. Wait, the definition of the recurrence is:\n\nuₙ = \n\n0, if u_{n-1}=0;\n\n1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1} otherwise.\n\nSo, u₂ = 1 + 2v(2) - 1/u₁. But u₁ is given as 1. So, 1 + 2v(2) - 1/1 = 1 + 2v(2) -1 = 2v(2). So, u₂ = 2v(2). But since u₂ is an integer (as per the definition), and v(2) is 1, so u₂ = 2*1 = 2. Then u₃ = 1 + 2v(3) - 1/u₂. Since u₂=2, 1/u₂=1/2. So, u₃ = 1 + 2v(3) - 1/2. But u₃ must be integer. Therefore, 1 + 2v(3) - 1/2 must be integer. So, 2v(3) must be a half-integer? Wait, but v(3) is an integer (since it's the exponent of 2 in 3, which is 0). So 2v(3) is even integer. Then 1 + even integer - 1/2 = (odd integer) - 1/2 = integer. For example, if v(3)=0, then 1 + 0 - 1/2 = 1/2, which is not integer. But wait, that contradicts the definition. Wait, u₃ must be integer. So, 1 + 2v(3) must be integer + 1/u₂. Wait, but 1/u₂ is 1/2. So, 1 + 2v(3) - 1/2 must be integer. So, 2v(3) must be 1/2 + integer? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 1 + 2v(3) - 1/2 = (1 - 0.5) + 2v(3) = 0.5 + 2v(3). For this to be integer, 0.5 + 2v(3) must be integer. Therefore, 2v(3) must be a half-integer. But since v(3) is an integer, 2v(3) is even integer. Then 0.5 + even integer is not integer. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but the problem defines the sequence (u_n) with u₁=1, and for n≥2, u_n is defined as 0 if u_{n-1}=0, otherwise 1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1}. So, for n=2, u₂=1 + 2v(2) - 1/u₁. Since u₁=1, 1/u₁=1. Therefore, u₂=1 + 2v(2) -1=2v(2). So, u₂=2v(2). But u₂ must be an integer. So, since v(2)=1, u₂=2. Then, for n=3, u₃=1 + 2v(3) - 1/u₂=1 + 2v(3) - 1/2. But this is 0.5 + 2v(3). For u₃ to be integer, 0.5 + 2v(3) must be integer. Therefore, 2v(3) must be equal to (integer - 0.5). But 2v(3) is an even integer. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the recurrence cannot be satisfied unless 2v(3) is such that 0.5 + 2v(3) is integer. But 2v(3) is even integer, so 0.5 + even integer is a half-integer, which cannot be integer. Therefore, this suggests a contradiction. Therefore, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, but the problem is presented as a definition, so perhaps there is an error in the problem statement, or perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not in English, and the definition might be different. Wait, the original problem says:\n\n\"Given the integer sequence (u_n) defined by recursion: u₁ = 1 and, for each integer n ≥ 2, uₙ = [if u_{n-1}=0, then 0, else 1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1}].\"\n\nAssuming the square brackets are meant to be defined as per the case. So, if u_{n-1}=0, then u_n=0; otherwise, u_n=1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1}. Therefore, for n=2, u₂=1 + 2v(2) - 1/u₁=1 + 2*1 -1=2. For n=3, u₃=1 + 2v(3) -1/u₂=1 + 2*0 -1/2=1 +0 -0.5=0.5. But 0.5 is not an integer. Therefore, u₃ is 0.5, which is not an integer. But the problem says that the sequence (u_n) is defined with u₁=1 and the recurrence as above. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my interpretation is wrong. But the problem is presented as a standard problem, so perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is supposed to be defined as 1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1}, but u_{n} must be an integer. Therefore, if u_{n-1} is even, then 1/u_{n-1} is a fraction, so 1 + 2v(n) - 1/u_{n-1} must be an integer. Therefore, 2v(n) must compensate for the fractional part. Let's check for n=3. u₂=2, which is even. So, 1 + 2v(3) -1/2 must be integer. So, 2v(3) must be equal to (integer - 0.5). But 2v(3) is an even integer. Therefore, there is no integer v(3) that satisfies this equation. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's an error in the recurrence definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of v(n) is different. Wait, the problem defines v(n) as the largest natural number k such that n/(2^k) is integer. Wait, n/(2^k) is integer. So, n must be divisible by 2^k, but not by 2^{k+1}. So, v(n) is the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n. For example, for n=2, v(n)=1. For n=4, v(n)=2. For n=3, v(n)=0. For n=5, v(n)=0. For n=6, v(n)=1. For n=12, v(n)=2. So, in the case of n=2, v(2)=1. Therefore, in the recurrence for u₃, u₃=1 + 2v(3) -1/u₂. Since u₂=2, then 1/u₂=1/2. So, u₃=1 + 2*0 -1/2=0.5. But u₃ must be an integer. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, unless there is a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the problem is designed to have the recurrence hold even if u₃ is not integer?

Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation.

Let me start by recalling that e^(i θ) can be represented using Euler's formula: e^(i θ) = cos θ + i sin θ. So, since θ here is 2π/3, let me calculate the cosine and sine of that angle.\n\nFirst, the angle 2π/3 is 120 degrees, right? That's in the second quadrant. The cosine of 120 degrees is cos(180 - 60) = -cos(60°), which is -0.5. The sine of 120 degrees is sin(180 - 60) = sin(60°), which is √3/2. Therefore, j = cos(120°) + i sin(120°) = -1/2 + i√3/2. That's correct. So j is a complex number with real part -1/2 and imaginary part √3/2.\n\nNow, the problem asks for 1 + j + j². Let me compute each term step by step. The first term is 1, which is straightforward. The second term is j, which we already know. The third term is j². Let me compute j² first.\n\nSince j is a complex number, squaring it involves multiplying j by itself. Let's compute j²:\n\nj² = (-1/2 + i√3/2)².\n\nTo square this, I can use the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², where a = -1/2 and b = i√3/2. Let's compute each part:\n\na² = (-1/2)² = 1/4.\n\n2ab = 2*(-1/2)*(i√3/2) = 2*(-1/2)*(i√3/2) = (-1)*(i√3/2) = -i√3/2.\n\nb² = (i√3/2)² = (i²)*(√3/2)² = (-1)*(3/4) = -3/4.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\na² + 2ab + b² = 1/4 - i√3/2 - 3/4.\n\nSimplify the real parts: 1/4 - 3/4 = -2/4 = -1/2.\n\nSo j² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nNow, let's add up 1 + j + j²:\n\n1 + j + j² = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) + (-1/2 - i√3/2).\n\nLet me compute this step by step. First, let's write down each term:\n\n1 is just 1.\n\nj is -1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nj² is -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nAdding them together:\n\nReal parts: 1 (from the first term) + (-1/2) (from the second term) + (-1/2) (from the third term).\n\nCompute 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nImaginary parts: i√3/2 (from the second term) + (-i√3/2) (from the third term).\n\nCompute i√3/2 - i√3/2 = 0.\n\nSo overall, 0 + 0i = 0.\n\nWait, so 1 + j + j² equals 0? That's interesting. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with j²:\n\n(-1/2 + i√3/2)^2. Let's compute again:\n\n= (-1/2)^2 + 2*(-1/2)*(i√3/2) + (i√3/2)^2\n\n= 1/4 + 2*(-1/2)*(i√3/2) + (i²*3/4)\n\n= 1/4 + (-i√3/2) + (-3/4)\n\n= (1/4 - 3/4) + (-i√3/2)\n\n= (-2/4) + (-i√3/2)\n\n= -1/2 - i√3/2. That's correct.\n\nThen adding 1 + j + j²:\n\n1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) + (-1/2 - i√3/2)\n\nCombine the real parts: 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nCombine the imaginary parts: i√3/2 - i√3/2 = 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 1 + j + j² is indeed 0. Therefore, the result is 0. Let me just verify once more if I interpreted the problem correctly.\n\nThe problem defines a complex number j as e^(2πi/3), which is correct. The set Z[j] is the ring of integers generated by j, so it includes all numbers of the form a + b j where a and b are integers. But the problem is asking for the sum 1 + j + j², which we computed as 0. Since Z[j] is a subset of the complex plane, but the sum is a complex number, and we found it's 0, which is in Z[j] because 0 can be written as 0 + 0j. However, the problem might be referring to the sum in the complex plane, which is 0. So, unless there's a different interpretation, 0 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, but using the properties of j. Since j is a primitive cube root of unity, we know that 1 + j + j² = 0. That's a standard identity in complex numbers. Specifically, for any primitive nth root of unity ω, we have 1 + ω + ω² + ... + ω^{n-1} = 0. Since j is a cube root of unity (j³ = 1, and j ≠ 1), then 1 + j + j² = 0. This identity holds in any field of characteristic not equal to 3, which is the case here since we're dealing with complex numbers. Therefore, this result is general and not dependent on the specific values of a, b, etc. So regardless of the subset A, if it's a type S set containing j, then 1 + j + j² is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\nI think that's thorough. The key steps were calculating j², then adding 1 + j + j², which cancels out all terms. Also, recognizing the identity for cube roots of unity is a useful shortcut. So, the final answer should be 0.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

The problem is asking how many different ways there are to seat 6 girls and 15 boys around a circular table so that there are at least two boys between any two girls. Hmm. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, seating arrangements around a circular table usually involve considering rotations as the same arrangement, right? So, for circular permutations, the formula is (n-1)! for n people. But here, there's a specific condition about the spacing between girls. We need at least two boys between any two girls. That means between any two girls, there must be at least two boys. So, the arrangement has to be such that the girls are placed in a way that they are not too close to each other.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe first, arrange the boys first and then place the girls in the gaps between the boys. Since it's a circular table, the arrangement of the boys will determine the gaps where the girls can be placed. If we fix the boys in a circular arrangement, the number of gaps between the boys is equal to the number of boys, which is 15. Each gap can then hold at most one girl, but since we have 6 girls, we need to place them into these 15 gaps with the condition that no two girls are placed in the same gap. Wait, but the problem states \"at least two boys between any two girls,\" which translates to at least one gap between any two girls. Because if there are two boys between girls, that means they are separated by one seat. Wait, no, actually, if there are two boys between two girls, that would mean that between two girls, there are two boys, so the gap between them is two seats. But in terms of the circular table, the number of seats between two girls would be the number of gaps between them. So, if two girls are separated by two boys, the number of seats between them is three, right? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the spacing.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of seats. If two girls are sitting next to each other, that would mean there are zero boys between them, which violates the condition. So, we need to ensure that between any two adjacent girls, there are at least two boys. Therefore, the number of seats between any two girls must be at least three (since two boys plus two seats would mean three seats in between). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have a circular table with 21 seats. We need to seat 6 girls and 15 boys. If we place the girls first, each girl needs to have at least two boys between them. So, the minimum number of seats between two girls is two, which would mean that the number of seats occupied by boys between two girls is two. In terms of the gap between two girls, it's the number of seats between them. So, if two girls are separated by two boys, that would mean between them, there are three seats (two boys and one seat). Wait, maybe I need to model this differently.\n\nAlternatively, think of the girls as being placed in the circle with the condition that there are no two girls adjacent, and there are at least two boys between any two girls. So, the maximum number of girls that can be seated around the table with this condition is... Well, if we have 15 boys, each can be between two girls, but the spacing between girls needs to be at least two boys. So, for each girl, there must be at least two boys after her before the next girl comes. Therefore, the arrangement would be something like B B G B B G ... etc., where B represents a boy and G a girl. But since the table is circular, we can't have a separator after the last girl.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: If we fix the boys in a circular arrangement first, then we can place the girls in the gaps between the boys such that each gap has at least two boys. But since the problem says \"at least two boys between any two girls,\" that means that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. So, if we consider the boys as separators, the girls must be placed in the gaps between the boys, and each gap must have at least two boys. Wait, but if we fix the boys first, how does that affect the gaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model this as a circular arrangement where we place the girls with at least two boys between them. Let's consider the standard circular permutation with some constraints. Normally, for circular permutations, the number is (n-1)! for n people. But here, we have an additional constraint on the spacing between the girls.\n\nSo, first, perhaps we can model this problem as placing the girls in the circle such that no two are adjacent, and the spacing between any two girls is at least two seats. Wait, but the problem states \"at least two boys between any two girls,\" which is equivalent to saying that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. So, the number of seats between two girls must be at least three (since two boys plus two seats would be three seats in between). Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nIf two girls are seated such that there are two boys between them, that would mean that between them, there are three seats (two boys and one empty seat). But the problem says \"at least two boys between any two girls,\" which would mean that the number of seats between two girls is at least three (since two boys and one seat between them). Wait, but the seats are part of the table. So, if we have two girls, the number of seats between them would be the number of seats in between excluding the girls. So, if two girls are separated by two boys, the number of seats between them is three (two boys plus one seat). Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of seats between two girls.\n\nAlternatively, think of the girls as being placed with at least two boys between them. So, the minimal distance between two girls is three seats (two boys plus one empty seat). But since it's a circular table, this would form a pattern. Let's try to model this.\n\nSuppose we fix one girl's position to account for rotational symmetry. Then, the other five girls need to be placed such that there are at least two boys between any two girls. Since the table is circular, the problem reduces to arranging the girls in the remaining seats with the spacing constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard approach is to first arrange the boys and then place the girls in the remaining seats with the required gaps.\n\nLet me try that. So, if we have 15 boys arranged around the table, that creates 15 gaps between them. Each gap can hold at most one girl. But since we need at least two boys between any two girls, that means that between any two girls, there must be at least two boys. Wait, but if we have 15 boys, each separated by one seat, then the number of gaps is 15. But if we need at least two boys between any two girls, then between two girls, there must be at least two boys. But if we place a girl in a gap, that gap can hold up to one girl. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model this as placing the girls in the gaps between the boys. Since the girls must be placed such that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. So, the number of boys between two girls must be at least two. Therefore, the number of seats between two girls (excluding the girls themselves) must be at least two. So, in the circular arrangement, each girl must be placed in a gap that is separated by at least two boys from the next girl.\n\nBut how does that translate into the number of possible arrangements? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, fix the position of one girl to account for rotational symmetry. Then, we need to place the remaining five girls in the gaps between the boys, ensuring that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. Since we have 15 boys, there are 15 gaps between them. Each gap can hold at most one girl. But since we need to place five girls, we need to choose five gaps out of these 15 such that the chosen gaps are not adjacent to each other. Wait, but the spacing requirement is more than just adjacency; it's about the number of boys between the girls.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as a problem of placing the girls in the gaps between the boys, with the constraint that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. So, if we imagine the boys as fixed, and we want to place the girls in the gaps between the boys with at least two boys between each girl.\n\nBut in the circular arrangement, the gaps between the boys are 15. So, if we have 15 gaps, and we need to place five girls in these gaps such that no two girls are in adjacent gaps (since that would mean the girls are adjacent in the original circle). Wait, but if two girls are in adjacent gaps, that would mean they are separated by one gap, which is the same as being adjacent in the original arrangement. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, if we have the boys arranged in a circle, there are 15 gaps between them. Each gap is a single seat between two boys. If we place a girl in a gap, that gap is between two boys. If we place another girl in an adjacent gap, that would mean the two girls are adjacent. But we need to ensure that between any two girls, there are at least two boys. So, if we place a girl in a gap, the next girl cannot be in the gap immediately following it (since that would mean only one boy is between them). Wait, no. If we have two girls in adjacent gaps, the number of boys between them would be the number of gaps between them. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of placing the girls in the gaps between the boys. Each girl occupies a gap, which is a single seat. The constraints are that between any two girls, there must be at least two boys. So, in terms of the gaps, if we have a girl in gap i and a girl in gap j, the number of boys between them is the number of gaps between i and j. For example, if two girls are in gaps i and j, the number of boys between them is the number of gaps between i and j minus one. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as placing the girls in the gaps between the boys, with the condition that any two girls are not placed in consecutive gaps. Because if two girls are in consecutive gaps, that would mean they are adjacent in the original circle, which is not allowed (since there should be at least two boys between any two girls). Wait, but if the girls are in consecutive gaps, that means they are separated by one seat, which would have only one boy between them. But the problem requires at least two boys between any two girls, so that's not allowed. Therefore, the girls must be placed in gaps that are not adjacent. So, the problem reduces to placing five girls into the 15 gaps between the boys, with the condition that no two girls are in adjacent gaps. This is similar to placing objects with gaps between them. \n\nIn combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k non-adjacent positions out of n positions is C(n - k + 1, k). So, in this case, n = 15 gaps, k = 5 girls, so the number of ways to choose the gaps is C(15 - 5 + 1, 5) = C(11, 5). However, this is without considering the circular nature. Wait, but we fixed one girl's position to account for rotational symmetry. Wait, but maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, when we fix one girl's position, we are effectively linearizing the problem. Because in circular arrangements, fixing one position accounts for rotational symmetry, converting it into a linear arrangement. So, if we fix one girl's seat, then the remaining 5 girls need to be placed in the remaining 14 seats, with the condition that no two are adjacent, and there are at least two boys between any two girls. Wait, but in this case, the problem is different because the seats between the girls must have at least two boys. So, maybe fixing one girl's position and then placing the remaining girls with the spacing constraint.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this as placing the 15 boys first, which creates 15 gaps. Then, we need to place 6 girls into these gaps such that each girl is in a separate gap (since we need at least two boys between them). But since there are 15 gaps and 6 girls, we need to choose 6 gaps out of 15, but with the condition that no two selected gaps are adjacent. The number of ways to choose 6 non-adjacent gaps out of 15 is C(15 - 6 + 1, 6) = C(10, 6). Then, once the gaps are chosen, we can arrange the girls in those gaps in 6! ways. Similarly, the boys can be arranged in 15! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be C(10, 6) * 6! * 15!.\n\nBut wait, let's check this logic. If we fix the boys first, then the number of ways to place the girls in the gaps with the required spacing is C(10, 6). Let me verify this formula. The formula for choosing k non-adjacent items out of n is C(n - k + 1, k). So, here, n = 15 gaps, k = 6 girls. So, C(15 - 6 + 1, 6) = C(10, 6). That seems correct.\n\nBut why is this the case? Let's think of it as placing 6 girls into 15 gaps with no two adjacent. The number of ways is C(15 - 6 + 1, 6). So, if we imagine the 15 gaps, and we need to choose 6 of them such that none are consecutive. To do this, we can think of the 6 girls as needing to occupy 6 gaps, and the 9 remaining gaps must be at least one gap between them. So, we can model this as placing 6 girls and 9 gaps, where the 9 gaps are distributed as separators. The number of ways to do this is C(15 - 6 + 1, 6) = C(10, 6). That makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements would be:\n\nNumber of ways to choose gaps * number of ways to arrange girls in gaps * number of ways to arrange boys in seats.\n\nWait, but the seats are fixed once the boys are arranged. So, if we fix the boys in a circular arrangement, creating 15 gaps, then the girls have to be placed in those gaps with the spacing condition. The boys can be arranged in 15! ways, and the girls in 6! ways. The gaps are determined by the boys, so the total number is C(10, 6) * 6! * 15!.\n\nBut wait, let", "answer": "Chacune des 6 filles a un garçon à sa gauche et un à sa droite.

Let me start by understanding what each sum is about. \n\nFirst, S₁ is the sum from k = 0 to n of k² multiplied by the binomial coefficient (n choose k). That is, S₁ = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k² * C(n, k). Hmm, binomial coefficients... I remember that sums involving binomial coefficients often have generating functions or combinatorial interpretations. Let me recall some standard identities. \n\nI know that the sum of k * C(n, k) from k = 0 to n is equal to n * 2^(n-1). Let me verify that. Suppose we consider the binomial theorem: (1 + 1)^n = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ C(n, k) * 1^k * 1^(n-k) = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ C(n, k). That's just 2^n. Now, if we take the derivative with respect to x of both sides, we get Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k * C(n, k) * x^(k-1) = n * 2^(n-1). Multiplying both sides by x gives Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k * C(n, k) * x^k = n * 2^(n-1) * x. Then setting x = 1, we get Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k * C(n, k) = n * 2^(n-1). Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, S₁ is the sum of k² * C(n, k). How do I approach that? Maybe use the same technique but with k². Let me think. The standard approach for sums involving k² is to use the fact that k² = k(k - 1) + k. So, S₁ = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ [k(k - 1) + k] * C(n, k) = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k) + Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k C(n, k). \n\nWe already know that the second sum is n * 2^(n-1). The first sum, Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k), can be related to the second sum. Let's compute that. Let's consider the sum Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k). If we think of generating functions, the generating function for Σₖ₌₀ⁿ C(n, k) x^k is (1 + x)^n. Taking derivatives again, the second derivative would give Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k) x^(k - 2). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst derivative: (1 + x)^n * n. Second derivative: n * n * (1 + x)^(n - 2). Evaluating at x = 1, we get n^2 * 2^(n - 2). Therefore, Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k) = n^2 * 2^(n - 2). \n\nTherefore, combining both sums, S₁ = n^2 * 2^(n - 2) + n * 2^(n - 1). Let's factor out n * 2^(n - 2): S₁ = n * 2^(n - 2) [n + 2]. Wait, let's check the arithmetic. \n\nWait, n^2 * 2^(n - 2) + n * 2^(n - 1) = n^2 * 2^(n - 2) + 2n * 2^(n - 2) = (n^2 + 2n) * 2^(n - 2) = n(n + 2) * 2^(n - 2). Alternatively, factoring n * 2^(n - 2): n * 2^(n - 2) * (n + 2). \n\nAlternatively, n * 2^(n - 2) * (n + 2) = n(n + 2) * 2^(n - 2). But let me see if this can be simplified further. Maybe write as n(n + 2) 2^{n - 2}. Alternatively, factor 2^{n - 2} as (2^{n}) / 4, so n(n + 2) 2^{n} / 4 = (n(n + 2)/4) 2^{n}. But I think it's fine as n(n + 2) 2^{n - 2}. Let me check for small n. \n\nTake n = 1. Then S₁ = 0^2 * C(1,0) + 1^2 * C(1,1) = 0 + 1*1 = 1. The formula gives 1*(1 + 2)*2^{-1} = 1*3*0.5 = 1.5, which is 3/2. Wait, that's not 1. Hmm, so my formula is wrong. Wait, n=1: S₁ = 0 + 1 = 1. But according to the formula n(n + 2) 2^{n - 2}, when n=1, that's 1*3*2^{-1} = 3/2. Not matching. So my calculation must be wrong. \n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine. \n\nWe started with S₁ = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k² C(n, k) = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k - 1) C(n, k) + Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k C(n, k). \n\nFor n=1: Σₖ₌₀¹ k² C(1, k) = 0² * 1 + 1² * 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. \n\nBut using the formula: n(n + 2) 2^{n - 2} = 1*(1 + 2)*2^{-1} = 3/2. Which is 1.5, not 1. So something's wrong. So my approach must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step when I split k² into k(k - 1) + k. Let's check that. If k = 0, then k(k - 1) = 0. So for k=0, it's 0, and k=1, 1*0 +1 =1. So Σ k² C(n, k) = Σ [k(k -1) + k] C(n,k) = Σ k(k -1) C(n,k) + Σ k C(n,k). That's correct. \n\nBut when n=1, Σ k(k -1) C(1,k) would be k=0: 0*(-1)*C(1,0)=0, k=1: 1*0*C(1,1)=0. So total 0. Then Σ k C(n,k) is 1. So total S₁=0 +1=1. But according to the formula n(n + 2) 2^{n - 2}, it's 1*(1 + 2)*2^{-1}=3/2. So discrepancy. Therefore, the formula must be wrong. \n\nTherefore, my approach is incorrect. Wait, maybe I confused the generating functions. Let me check again. \n\nThe generating function for Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k is n(n -1) x² (1 + x)^{n - 2}. So setting x=1, that would be n(n -1) 2^{n - 2}. But when n=1, that's 1*0*2^{-1}=0, which is correct because the sum k(k -1) C(1,k) is 0. But when n=2, let's check. \n\nFor n=2, S₁ = 0²*C(2,0) +1²*C(2,1) +2²*C(2,2) = 0 + 2 +4 =6. The formula would be 2*(2 +2)*2^{0}=4*1=4, which is incorrect. So the formula is wrong. \n\nSo my mistake must be in the generating function approach. Let me re-examine that. \n\nWait, the generating function for Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k is indeed n(n -1) x² (1 + x)^{n - 2}. So when x=1, that's n(n -1) 2^{n - 2}. But when n=1, that's 0. When n=2, that's 2*1*2^{0}=2. But for n=2, the sum is 0 + 2*1 +4*1=6. Wait, but according to generating functions, Σ k(k -1) C(2,k) = 0 + 0 + 2*1*1 + 4*1=6. Wait, no. Wait, for n=2, Σₖ₌₀² k(k -1) C(2,k) = 0*C(2,0) + (-1)*C(2,1) + 0*C(2,2) = 0 - 2 +0= -2. Wait, but generating function gives n(n -1) x² (1 +x)^{n -2}. For n=2, that's 2*1*x²*(1 +x)^0 =2x². Evaluating at x=1, that's 2. But the actual sum is -2. Hmm, so there's a sign problem. \n\nWait, but in the generating function approach, when k=0, k(k-1)=0, so that term is zero. For k=1, k(k-1)=0, so that term is zero. For k=2, 2*1=2, so term is 2*1*C(2,2)=2*1=2. So Σ k(k -1) C(2,k) =2. But according to generating function, it's 2x² evaluated at x=1, which is 2. But the actual sum is 2. Wait, that's correct. Wait, but when I computed manually, I got 0 + 0 +4=4? Wait, no. Wait, when n=2: k=0: 0, k=1:1² * C(2,1)=1*2=2, k=2:2² * C(2,2)=4*1=4. So total 0 +2 +4=6. Wait, but according to the generating function, it's 2x² evaluated at x=1 is 2. But that's only the sum of k(k-1) C(2,k). Wait, no. Wait, the generating function is Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k. So for n=2, x^0 term is 0, x^1 term is 0, x^2 term is 2*1*1=2, x^3 term is 0. So total sum is 2. But when we compute the actual sum, it's 0 +2 +4=6. Wait, that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, no. Wait, for n=2, Σ k(k -1) C(2,k) x^k =0 +0 +2*1=2. But the actual sum for k=0,1,2: 0²*1 +1²*2 +2²*1=0 +2 +4=6. So there's a disconnect here. Therefore, my generating function approach must be wrong. Where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, actually, the generating function is Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k. Let's compute that for n=2. \n\nΣₖ₌₀² k(k -1) C(2,k) x^k = [0* (-1) * C(2,0)] x^0 + [1*0 * C(2,1)] x^1 + [2*1 * C(2,2)] x^2 = 0 +0 +4x². So the sum is 4x². Then, to get the sum Σ k(k -1) C(n,k), we set x=1: 4*1²=4. But the actual sum is 0 +0 +4=4. Wait, that's correct! Wait, but when n=2, the sum Σ k(k -1) C(2,k) is 4, which matches 4x² evaluated at x=1. So why did I think it was 2 earlier? Because I thought the generating function was x². Wait, for n=2, the generating function is 4x², so the coefficient of x² is 4. So Σₖ₌₀² k(k -1) C(2,k) =4. But when I manually calculated, it's 0 +0 +4=4. So that's correct. Then, when I thought the generating function was n(n -1) x² (1 +x)^{n -2}, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the generating function.\n\nLet me re-derive the generating function. \n\nThe generating function for C(n,k) is (1 + x)^n. To get Σₖ₌₀ⁿ C(n,k) x^k = (1 + x)^n. \n\nTo get Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k C(n,k) x^k, we take the derivative once: d/dx (1 + x)^n = n(1 + x)^{n -1}. Then multiply by x: Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k C(n,k) x^k = n(1 +x)^{n -1} * x. \n\nTo get Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k, take the derivative again: d/dx [n(1 +x)^{n -1} * x] = n[(n -1)(1 +x)^{n -2} * x + (1 +x)^{n -1} * 1] = n(n -1)(1 +x)^{n -2} x + n(1 +x)^{n -1}. Then multiply by x: Σₖ₌₀ⁿ k(k -1) C(n,k) x^k = n(n -1)(1 +x)^{n -1} x + n(1 +x)^n. \n\nBut when x=1, this becomes n(n -1)(2)^{n -1", "answer": "\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Soit \\( n \\) un entier naturel non nul et la fonction polynôme \\( P \\) définie sur \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) par \\( P(x) = (1 + x)^n \\).

So, we have this jar with 2n+1 balls numbered from 0 to 2n. We remove them by taking three balls each time, and if the numbers are a, b, c with a < b < c, we remove a and c and put back b. After n such operations, there's one ball left, and we need to find the distribution of that last ball's number for n=1 and n=2.\n\nStarting with n=1. Let's see. For n=1, there are 2*1 +1 =3 balls: 0,1,2. We need to remove them by taking three balls each time. Wait, but there are only three balls, so the first operation will remove all three, leaving one. So the last ball is determined by the operation we perform. Wait, but the operation is to take three balls, but there's only three. So, the first operation is the only one we need to perform, and the result is the same as the number of the middle one. So, the probability that the last ball is 0, 1, or 2 is 1/3 each? Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, when you take three balls, you remove the two outer ones and keep the middle one. So for the first operation, which is the only possible one, the result is the number of the middle ball. So the last ball is always the middle one. Therefore, the probability that the last ball is 0, 1, or 2 is equal to their initial counts divided by the total. But wait, there's only one ball of each number, so each has a 1/3 chance. So P(D_1=0)=1/3, similar for 1 and 2. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me confirm. The numbers are 0,1,2. The middle one when you take all three is 1. So yes, the last ball is 1. So P(D_1=1)=1. But the problem statement says \"the last ball is k\", so maybe for n=1, the probabilities are each 1/3. But the problem might be more general. Wait, perhaps the process is different? Wait, maybe when you take three balls, you remove two and keep one, but the operation is to remove a and c and put back b. Wait, but if you have three balls, a, b, c, with a < b < c, then you remove a and c, so you have one ball left, which is b. So in this case, the last ball is the middle one. Therefore, for n=1, since all three balls are present, the last ball is always the middle one, which is 1. So P(D_1=1)=1. But the problem says \"the last ball is k\", so maybe the answer is that D_1 is always 1, so the distribution is uniform? But the problem mentions to determine the law, so maybe the probability is 1 for each k=0,1,2? Wait, but that's not possible because there are three balls, so the probability should sum to 1. If each has 1/3, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"In a jar, we place 2n+1 balls indistinguishable and numbered 0,1,2,…,2n. We empty the jar by successively removing the balls according to the following protocol: on each step, draw three balls simultaneously; if the three balls drawn have numbers a, b, c with a < b < c, we delete the balls with numbers a and c and replace with the ball of number b. Repeat this process until only one ball remains in the jar. Let D_n be the number of the last ball in the jar. For each integer k, let P(D_n=k) be the probability that the last ball remaining in the jar is k. Determine the law of the random variable D_1 and D_2.\"\n\nSo, for n=1, we have three balls, 0,1,2. The process is to take three balls, which is all of them, and since a=0, b=1, c=2, we remove 0 and 2, keeping 1. So the last ball is 1. Therefore, the distribution is P(D_1=1)=1. So the law is that D_1 is always 1, so P(D_1=1)=1.\n\nBut maybe the problem is expecting a different answer. Wait, perhaps when you take three balls, you can't take all three at once? Wait, the problem says \"successively remove the balls according to the following protocol: take three balls simultaneously\". Wait, maybe \"simultaneously\" here means that each operation involves taking three balls at the same time, but if there are fewer than three, you can't do it. But for n=1, there are exactly three balls, so you have to take all three. Therefore, the last ball is always 1. Hence, the law is that D_1=1 with probability 1.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more general. Let me check n=2. For n=2, there are 5 balls: 0,1,2,3,4. The process is to take three balls at a time, and if the numbers are a < b < c, remove a and c, replace with b. Repeat this process until one ball remains.\n\nSo for n=2, how does this process work? Let's consider possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, the first step: we have 5 balls. The probability of each possible triple is C(5,3)=10. Then, depending on the triple, we remove two and keep one. Then we repeat the process with the remaining four balls, and so on until one remains.\n\nThe key is to model the possible transitions from each state (current set of balls) to the next state (remaining balls after one step) and determine the probabilities.\n\nBut since the problem is only for n=1 and n=2, maybe we can compute the probability distributions manually.\n\nStarting with n=1: As before, the only possible triple is 0,1,2, removing 0 and 2, keeping 1. So P(D_1=1)=1. Therefore, the law is uniform over {1}, so P(D_1=k)=1 for k=1.\n\nFor n=2: Let's see. We start with 0,1,2,3,4. We need to perform two operations, each time taking three balls, removing two and keeping one, until we have one left.\n\nEach operation reduces the number of balls by two each time, so starting from 5, after first operation: 5-2=3 balls; after second operation: 3-2=1 ball.\n\nSo first, we need to consider all possible triples in the first operation and their probabilities, then in each case, compute the possible triples in the second operation, and so on.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can find a pattern or symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a martingale or expectation approach, but I'm not sure. Let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nFirst step for n=2: We have 5 balls. The total number of possible triples is C(5,3)=10. Each triple has a probability of 1/10. Then, each triple leads to a new set of balls.\n\nLet's list all possible triples and their outcomes:\n\n1. (0,1,2): Remove 0 and 2, keep 1. Remaining balls: 1,3,4.\n2. (0,1,3): Remove 0 and 3, keep 1. Remaining balls:1,2,4.\n3. (0,1,4): Remove 0 and 4, keep 1. Remaining balls:1,2,3.\n4. (0,2,3): Remove 0 and 3, keep 2. Remaining balls:1,2,4.\n5. (0,2,4): Remove 0 and 4, keep 2. Remaining balls:1,2,3.\n6. (0,3,4): Remove 0 and 4, keep 3. Remaining balls:1,2,3.\n7. (1,2,3): Remove 1 and 3, keep 2. Remaining balls:0,2,4.\n8. (1,2,4): Remove 1 and 4, keep 2. Remaining balls:0,2,3.\n9. (1,3,4): Remove 1 and 4, keep 3. Remaining balls:0,2,3.\n10. (2,3,4): Remove 2 and 4, keep 3. Remaining balls:0,1,3.\n\nNow, for each of these triples, we need to compute the remaining balls and then perform the next operation.\n\nLet's take each case:\n\n1. After triple (0,1,2), remaining balls:1,3,4.\n2. After triple (0,1,3), remaining balls:1,2,4.\n3. After triple (0,1,4), remaining balls:1,2,3.\n4. After triple (0,2,3), remaining balls:1,2,4.\n5. After triple (0,2,4), remaining balls:1,2,3.\n6. After triple (0,3,4), remaining balls:1,2,3.\n7. After triple (1,2,3), remaining balls:0,2,4.\n8. After triple (1,2,4), remaining balls:0,2,3.\n9. After triple (1,3,4), remaining balls:0,2,3.\n10. After triple (2,3,4), remaining balls:0,1,3.\n\nSo, for each of these cases, we need to compute the next two operations.\n\nLet's take case 1: remaining balls 1,3,4. Now, we need to take three balls. But there are only three balls, so we take all three. Then, a=1, b=3, c=4. Remove 1 and 4, keep 3. So the final ball is 3. So in this case, D_2=3.\n\nSimilarly, case 2: remaining balls 1,2,4. Take all three. a=1, b=2, c=4. Remove 1 and 4, keep 2. So D_2=2.\n\nCase 3: remaining balls 1,2,3. Take all three. a=1, b=2, c=3. Remove 1 and 3, keep 2. So D_2=2.\n\nCase 4: remaining balls 1,2,4. Same as case 2, leads to D_2=2.\n\nCase 5: remaining balls 1,2,3. Same as case 3, leads to D_2=2.\n\nCase 6: remaining balls 1,2,3. Same as case 3, leading to D_2=2.\n\nCase 7: remaining balls 0,2,4. Take three balls. a=0, b=2, c=4. Remove 0 and 4, keep 2. So D_2=2.\n\nCase 8: remaining balls 0,2,3. Take three balls. a=0, b=2, c=3. Remove 0 and 3, keep 2. So D_2=2.\n\nCase 9: remaining balls 0,2,3. Same as case 8, leads to D_2=2.\n\nCase 10: remaining balls 0,1,3. Take three balls. a=0, b=1, c=3. Remove 0 and 3, keep 1. So D_2=1.\n\nSo, summarizing the outcomes for each initial triple:\n\n1. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=3\n2. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n3. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n4. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n5. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n6. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n7. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n8. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n9. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=2\n10. 1/10 chance leads to D_2=1\n\nSo, let's count how many times each D_2 occurs:\n\n- D_2=1: occurs in case 10: 1/10\n- D_2=2: occurs in cases 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 8 cases, which is 8/10 = 4/5\n- D_2=3: occurs in case 1: 1/10\n\nTherefore, the distribution P(D_2=k) is:\n\n- P(D_2=1) = 1/10\n- P(D_2=2) = 8/10 = 4/5\n- P(D_2=3) = 1/10\n\nWait, but let's verify the counts again.

", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to show that for any positive real number u, the natural logarithm of (1 + u) is less than or equal to u. Hmm, let's start by recalling some inequalities that might be useful here. I remember that the Taylor series expansion of ln(1 + x) around x = 0 is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... and so on. Since u is positive, maybe I can use the fact that the series converges and thus the remainder after a certain term is positive. Wait, but how does that relate to the inequality ln(1 + u) ≤ u?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(x) = x - ln(1 + x) and show that it's always non-negative for x > 0. Let me try that. If I can show that f(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0, then obviously ln(1 + x) ≤ x. Let's compute f(x):\n\nf(x) = x - ln(1 + x)\n\nNow, let's compute its derivative. The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of ln(1 + x) is 1/(1 + x). So,\n\nf'(x) = 1 - 1/(1 + x) = 1/(1 + x)\n\nSince x > 0, 1 + x > 1, so 1/(1 + x) is positive. That means f'(x) is positive for all x > 0. Therefore, f(x) is an increasing function on (0, ∞). Let's check its behavior at x = 0. The limit as x approaches 0 from the right of f(x) is 0 - ln(1 + 0) = 0. Since the function is increasing and starts at 0, the function f(x) must be non-negative for all x > 0. Therefore, ln(1 + x) ≤ x for all x > 0. That seems to work!\n\nWait, but the problem asks to show that for any positive real number u, ln(1 + u) ≤ u. So, if we set x = u, then by this result, ln(1 + u) ≤ u. That's exactly what we needed to show. So, that's straightforward with the function f(x) and its properties.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check if there's another way or if there are any cases where this might not hold. Let me test with some specific values. Let's take x = 1. Then ln(2) ≈ 0.693, and 1 is greater than 0.693, so the inequality holds. If x = 0.5, ln(1.5) ≈ 0.405, which is less than 0.5. So that works too. How about a very small x, say x = 0.1. Then ln(1.1) ≈ 0.0953, which is less than 0.1. So the inequality holds here as well. It seems consistent. The function f(x) is strictly increasing, starting at 0 when x=0, so it's always non-negative. Therefore, the inequality holds for all u > 0.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might be to use induction. Suppose the inequality holds for some integer n, then show it holds for n + 1. Wait, but the problem states it's for any positive real number u, not just integers. So induction on integers might not directly apply. However, maybe using the integral test or comparing the series to another series. Let's think about that.\n\nThe inequality ln(1 + u) ≤ u can be related to the comparison of the harmonic series. The integral of 1/(1 + x) from 0 to u is ln(1 + u), and the sum of 1/k from k = 1 to n is v_n. But how does that relate? Maybe not directly, but if we can bound the sum v_n by an integral. For example, the sum v_n = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n is less than or equal to 1 + ∫₀¹ (1/(1 + x)) dx. Wait, let's compute that integral: ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + x) dx = ln(2). So 1 + ln(2) is approximately 1.693. But that's a bit larger than ln(2), which is about 0.693. But I'm not sure how that helps with the inequality ln(1 + u) ≤ u.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compare v_n to the integral. For example, the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k is less than 1 + ∫₀ⁿ 1/(1 + x) dx. Wait, but the integral from 1 to n of 1/(1 + x) dx is ln(1 + n) - ln(1) = ln(1 + n). So the sum is less than 1 + ln(1 + n). But that might not be useful here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the inequality ln(1 + u) ≤ u as equivalent to u - ln(1 + u) ≥ 0, which is the same as the function f(x) = x - ln(1 + x). As before, if we can show that f(x) is always non-negative, then we're done.\n\nAnother thought: for u > 0, we can use the fact that the Taylor series of ln(1 + x) is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... So, ln(1 + x) ≤ x is equivalent to x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... ≤ x. Which simplifies to -x²/2 + x³/3 - ... ≤ 0. But since x > 0, the terms alternate in sign but the first term is negative. However, this approach might not be straightforward. Maybe integrating or another method.\n\nWait, but if we consider the remainder of the Taylor series, which is the next term after x, which is -x²/2 + x³/3 - ... So, the remainder R_n(x) = -x²/2 + x³/3 - ... + (-1)^{n+1}x^{n+1}/(n + 1). For x > 0, the remainder alternates in sign, but starting from x²/2. So, if we take the first term as -x²/2, then R_1(x) = -x²/2. Then, the total function f(x) = x - ln(1 + x) can be written as x + R_1(x) + R_2(x) + ..., where R_2(x) = x³/3 - x^4/4 + ... So, if we bound the remainder terms. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the function f(x) = x - ln(1 + x) is convex or concave? Let's compute the second derivative. The first derivative is f'(x) = 1 - 1/(1 + x) = 1/(1 + x), and the second derivative is f''(x) = -1/(1 + x)^2, which is negative. So f(x) is concave on its domain. Since it's concave and differentiable, maybe we can use the property that if a concave function has a minimum at x=0, then f(x) ≥ f(0) for all x > 0. But f(0) = 0 - ln(1 + 0) = 0. So, if f(x) is concave and has a minimum at x=0, then f(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0, which is exactly what we need. That's another way to see it.\n\nYes, that seems like a valid approach. Since f(x) is concave and f(0) = 0, then for all x > 0, f(x) ≥ f(0) = 0. Therefore, ln(1 + x) ≤ x for all x > 0. That's a neat argument. So, combining these different methods, whether through the function's behavior, its derivatives, or the concavity and convexity properties, we can establish the inequality.\n\nBut let me verify with another example. Let's take u = 2. Then ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, which is less than 2. Correct. If u = 10, ln(11) ≈ 2.3979, which is less than 10. So the inequality holds for larger values as well. The rate at which ln(1 + u) grows is much slower than u, which is linear, so the inequality should hold for all positive u.\n\nAnother approach could be using the inequality ln(1 + x) ≤ x for all x > 0, which is a standard result. Maybe I can recall that the inequality is a consequence of the Taylor series expansion, as we did before, or by using the concept of concavity.\n\nAlternatively, think of the function g(x) = x - ln(1 + x). We can show that g(x) is increasing and g(0) = 0. Then, since g(x) is increasing, g(x) ≥ g(0) = 0 for all x > 0. Therefore, x - ln(1 + x) ≥ 0, which implies ln(1 + x) ≤ x.\n\nYes, that's straightforward. So, the key idea is to define the function and analyze its properties. Since g(x) is increasing and starts at 0, it doesn't dip below zero. Therefore, the inequality holds. That seems solid.\n\nI think I've covered multiple approaches: using the derivative, analyzing the function's behavior, considering concavity, and verifying with specific examples. All methods lead to the same conclusion that ln(1 + u) ≤ u for any positive real number u. Therefore, the proof is complete.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

The question is asking whether, for all natural numbers n greater than or equal to 21, the number 1 is an approximation of u_n = 1 + 1/n + (-1)^n / n² with an error less than 0.05. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition provided. A value a is an approximation of x with precision h if |a - x| < h. Here, a is 1, and x is u_n. So, the question is really asking if |1 - u_n| < 0.05 for all n ≥ 21. \n\nLet me write out the expression for the error term: |1 - u_n| = |1 - [1 + 1/n + (-1)^n / n²]|. Simplifying inside the absolute value, the 1's cancel out, leaving | -1/n - (-1)^n / n² |. Which is the same as |1/n + (-1)^{n+1} / n²|. \n\nSo, the absolute value of the error is |1/n + (-1)^{n+1} / n²|. To ensure this is less than 0.05, we need both terms to be less than 0.05. However, since the second term can be positive or negative depending on n, the total error could be the sum of the absolute values of both terms. But actually, since the expression is 1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n², the absolute value would be |1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n²|. \n\nWait, but since we have an absolute value around the entire expression, it's the same as |1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n²|. Let me check that again. \n\nOriginal expression: 1 - u_n = 1 - [1 + 1/n + (-1)^n / n²] = -1/n - (-1)^n /n². Then, taking absolute value: | -1/n - (-1)^n /n² | = |1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n²|. \n\nSo, the error is |1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n²|. \n\nNow, we need this to be less than 0.05 for all n ≥ 21. \n\nLet me analyze the two terms: 1/n and (-1)^{n+1}/n². \n\nFirst, 1/n is a positive term when n is odd and negative when n is even. However, since we have (-1)^{n+1}, when n is even, n+1 is odd, so (-1)^{n+1} is -1. So, when n is even, the second term becomes (-1)^{even +1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. So, the second term is -1 / n². Wait, no. Wait, (-1)^{n+1} when n is even: n is even, so n+1 is odd, so (-1)^{odd} = -1. So, the term is -1 / n². Similarly, when n is odd, n+1 is even, so (-1)^{even} = 1. So, the term is +1 / n². \n\nTherefore, the error term is 1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n². Let's split this into two cases: n even and n odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even. Then, (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. So, the error term is 1/n - 1/n².\n\nCase 2: n is odd. Then, (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{even} = 1. So, the error term is 1/n + 1/n².\n\nTherefore, depending on whether n is even or odd, the error term is either 1/n - 1/n² or 1/n + 1/n². \n\nWe need to find the maximum of these two expressions for n ≥ 21 and check if it's less than 0.05.\n\nSo, let's compute both cases.\n\nFirst, for n even:\n\nError = 1/n - 1/n² = (n - 1)/n². \n\nFor n odd:\n\nError = 1/n + 1/n² = (n + 1)/n². \n\nTherefore, for even n, the error is (n - 1)/n², and for odd n, it's (n + 1)/n². \n\nWe need to find the maximum of these two expressions for n ≥ 21 and check if they are both less than 0.05.\n\nAlternatively, since for n ≥ 21, whether even or odd, the error is either (n - 1)/n² or (n + 1)/n². Let's see for n ≥ 21, which one is larger.\n\nFor n even: (n - 1)/n² = n/n² - 1/n² = 1/n - 1/n². For n odd: (n + 1)/n². \n\nCompare (n + 1)/n² and (n - 1)/n². The difference between them is [(n + 1) - (n - 1)]/n² = 2/n². So, for n ≥ 21, (n + 1)/n² is larger than (n - 1)/n². Therefore, the maximum error for each n is (n + 1)/n² when n is odd, and (n - 1)/n² when n is even.\n\nTherefore, to find the maximum error across all n ≥ 21, we need to consider the maximum over all n ≥ 21 of (n + 1)/n² when n is odd, and (n - 1)/n² when n is even.\n\nBut since n is going to infinity, both terms (n + 1)/n² and (n - 1)/n² approach 0 as n increases. However, the question is whether, for all n ≥ 21, even the maximum among them is less than 0.05.\n\nBut since for n ≥ 21, both terms (n + 1)/n² and (n - 1)/n² will be less than, say, (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441 ≈ 0.05. Wait, 22/441 is approximately 0.05, which is exactly 0.05. So, for n = 21, let's compute both terms.\n\nWait, n = 21 is odd, so the error term for n = 21 is (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441 ≈ 0.05, exactly 0.05. \n\nBut the question is whether for n ≥ 21, the error is less than 0.05. So, for n = 21, the error is exactly 0.05. So, the answer would be no, because for n = 21, the error is exactly 0.05, which is not less than 0.05. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 21. Let's compute u_21. \n\nu_21 = 1 + 1/21 + (-1)^21 / 21². Since 21 is odd, (-1)^21 = -1. Therefore, u_21 = 1 + 1/21 - 1/21² = 1 + 1/21 - 1/441. \n\nCompute 1/21 ≈ 0.047619, and 1/441 ≈ 0.002267. Therefore, u_21 ≈ 1 + 0.047619 - 0.002267 ≈ 1.045352. \n\nSo, 1 - u_21 ≈ -0.045352, whose absolute value is ≈ 0.045352, which is less than 0.05. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, for n = 21 (odd), the error is (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441 ≈ 0.05. But when we compute it numerically, the error is approximately 0.045352, which is less than 0.05. So, that contradicts the previous idea that for n = 21, the error is exactly 0.05.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my previous analysis. Let's recast the error term.\n\nThe error term is |1/n + (-1)^{n+1}/n²|. For n = 21 (odd), this becomes |1/21 + (-1)^{22}/21²| = |1/21 + 1/21²|. Because (-1)^{22} is 1. So, the error is 1/21 + 1/441. Let's compute that:\n\n1/21 ≈ 0.047619, 1/441 ≈ 0.002267. Adding them gives approximately 0.047619 + 0.002267 ≈ 0.049886, which is about 0.049886, which is less than 0.05. So, my initial calculation was wrong. So, for n = 21, the error is approximately 0.049886, which is indeed less than 0.05. Therefore, 1 is an approximation of u_21 with error less than 0.05.\n\nWait, but earlier when I split the error term for n even and odd, I thought that for n even, the error is (n - 1)/n², and for n odd, (n + 1)/n². But actually, when n is even, the error is 1/n - 1/n², and when n is odd, the error is 1/n + 1/n². However, when I computed for n = 21, the error is (21 + 1)/21², but in reality, the error is 1/21 + 1/21², which is (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441, but wait, 22/441 is approximately 0.049886, which is slightly less than 0.05. So, 22/441 is approximately 0.05, but it's actually 0.049886, which is 0.049886 < 0.05. So, that's okay.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought that (n + 1)/n² is the error term for odd n, but if n = 21, then (n +1)/n² is 22/441 ≈ 0.05, but the actual error is 1/21 + 1/441 ≈ 0.049886, which is slightly less. So, perhaps my previous analysis was slightly off. Let's correct that.\n\nFor n odd: error term is 1/n + 1/n². For n even: error term is 1/n - 1/n². Therefore, for n odd, the error term is 1/n + 1/n² = (n + 1)/n². For n even, it's 1/n - 1/n² = (n - 1)/n². \n\nBut for n = 21 (odd), the error is (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441 ≈ 0.049886, which is less than 0.05. So, that's acceptable. Similarly, for n even, say n = 22 (even), the error is (22 - 1)/22² = 21/484 ≈ 0.0433, which is also less than 0.05. Wait, but when n increases, the error term (n - 1)/n² and (n + 1)/n² both approach 0. For example, as n approaches infinity, both (n - 1)/n² and (n + 1)/n² approximate to 1/n, which goes to 0. So, the maximum possible error would be when n is small. \n\nWait, for n = 21, the error is (21 + 1)/21² = 22/441 ≈ 0.049886, which is less than 0.05. For n = 22, (22 -1)/22² = 21/484 ≈ 0.0433, which is less than 0.05. For n = 23 (odd), error is (23 +1)/23² = 24/529 ≈ 0.0454, which is still less than 0.05. For n = 24 (even), (24 -1)/24² = 23/576 ≈ 0.0398, which is also less than 0.05. \n\nSo, as n increases, the error decreases. Therefore, the maximum error occurs at the smallest n ≥ 21, which is n = 21. For n = 21, the error is approximately 0.049886 < 0.05. Therefore, the answer should be yes, 1 is an approximation of u_n for all n ≥ 21 with an error less than 0.05.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this with more precise calculations. Let's compute the exact value for n = 21. \n\nu_21 = 1 + 1/21 + (-1)^21 / 21² = 1 + 1/21 - 1/441. \n\nCompute 1/21 = 0.047619047619, and 1/441 ≈ 0.002267573771.

The first part is to prove that two adjacent sequences converge to the same limit. The definition given is that two sequences are adjacent if one is increasing, the other decreasing, and the limit of their difference is zero. Hmm, right, so adjacent sequences have a limit difference of zero. \n\nFor part 1, the user wants me to first show that the sequence \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing. Then, deduce that all its terms are positive. Then, using those facts, conclude that the two sequences converge and have the same limit \\( l \\), with \\( u_n \\leq l \\leq v_n \\) for all \\( n \\). Finally, part 3 is the theorem that adjacent sequences converge to the same limit. \n\nSo, let's tackle the first part. Let me recall that if we have two sequences \\( u_n \\) and \\( v_n \\), and \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing, then it's either bounded below or above. Since each term is the difference of the two sequences, which are adjacent, the limit of \\( v_n - u_n \\) is zero. Therefore, the sequence \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing and converges to zero. So, it must be bounded below. Therefore, all terms \\( v_n - u_n \\) are positive. \n\nWait, but why can we say that \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing? The problem doesn't state that explicitly, but maybe we can derive it. Let's see. If \\( u_n \\) is increasing and \\( v_n \\) is decreasing, then the difference \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing? Let me check. Suppose \\( u_{n+1} > u_n \\) and \\( v_{n+1} < v_n \\). Then, \\( v_{n+1} - u_{n+1} < v_n - u_n \\), right? Because \\( v_{n+1} < v_n \\) and \\( -u_{n+1} > -u_n \\). So, yes, the difference is decreasing. Therefore, part 1 can be proven by showing that \\( v_{n+1} - u_{n+1} < v_n - u_n \\), which follows from the definitions of increasing and decreasing sequences. So, \\( v_n - u_n \\) is a decreasing sequence with limit zero, hence all terms are positive. Then, since \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing and positive, it must converge to zero. \n\nTherefore, all terms \\( v_n - u_n \\) are positive. Then, since \\( u_n \\) is increasing and bounded above by \\( v_n \\), it must converge to some limit \\( l \\). Similarly, \\( v_n \\) is decreasing and bounded below by \\( u_n \\), so it also converges to the same limit \\( l \\). \n\nSo, part 1 is manageable. Now, moving to Exercise 2. Let's look at parts (a), (b), (c). \n\nGiven the sequences:\n\n\\( u_0 = 3 \\), \\( v_0 = 4 \\)\n\n\\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\n\\( v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nSo, part (a) asks to show that \\( w_n = v_n - u_n \\) is a geometric sequence with ratio \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nOkay, let's compute \\( w_0 = v_0 - u_0 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\). Then, \\( w_1 = v_1 - u_1 \\). Let's compute \\( u_1 \\) and \\( v_1 \\). \n\n\\( u_1 = \\frac{3 + 4}{2} = 3.5 \\), \\( v_1 = \\frac{3.5 + 4}{2} = \\frac{7.5}{2} = 3.75 \\). So, \\( w_1 = 3.75 - 3.5 = 0.25 \\). \n\nNext, \\( w_2 = v_2 - u_2 \\). Let's compute \\( u_2 \\) and \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\( u_2 = \\frac{3.5 + 3.75}{2} = \\frac{7.25}{2} = 3.625 \\)\n\n\\( v_2 = \\frac{3.625 + 3.75}{2} = \\frac{7.375}{2} = 3.6875 \\)\n\nThen, \\( w_2 = 3.6875 - 3.625 = 0.0625 \\)\n\nSo, \\( w_0 = 1 \\), \\( w_1 = 0.25 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.0625 \\). It seems like a geometric sequence with ratio 0.25 each time. Let's check the ratio between \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_0 \\): 0.25 / 1 = 0.25. Then \\( 0.0625 / 0.25 = 0.25 \\). So yes, it's a geometric sequence with ratio \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). \n\nTherefore, part (a) is done by showing that \\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{4} w_n \\). Let's try to derive this in general. \n\nWe have:\n\n\\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\n\\( v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nSo, compute \\( w_{n+1} = v_{n+1} - u_{n+1} \\):\n\n\\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} - \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n - u_n - v_n}{2} \\)\n\n\\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} - u_n}{2} \\)\n\nBut \\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{\\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} - u_n}{2} = \\frac{v_n - u_n}{4} = \\frac{w_n}{4} \\)\n\nHence, \\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{4} w_n \\). Therefore, the sequence \\( w_n \\) is geometric with ratio \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). That's part (a). \n\nPart (b) asks to show that the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\) are adjacent. \n\nTo show two sequences are adjacent, we need to show that one is increasing, the other is decreasing, and \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (v_n - u_n) = 0 \\). \n\nFrom the definitions, the sequences are given by:\n\n\\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\n\\( v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nLet's check if \\( u_{n+1} \\geq u_n \\) or \\( v_{n+1} \\leq v_n \\). \n\nStarting with \\( u_{n+1} - u_n = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} - u_n = \\frac{-u_n + v_n}{2} \\). \n\nSimilarly, \\( v_{n+1} - v_n = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} - v_n = \\frac{u_{n+1} - v_n}{2} \\).\n\nHmm, not sure directly. Let's compute \\( u_{n+1} - u_n = \\frac{-u_n + v_n}{2} \\). Since \\( v_n - u_n = w_n \\), which is positive (from part (a)), so \\( v_n = u_n + w_n \\). Therefore:\n\n\\( u_{n+1} - u_n = \\frac{ -u_n + u_n + w_n }{2} = \\frac{w_n}{2} \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( v_{n+1} - v_n = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} - v_n = \\frac{u_{n+1} - v_n}{2} \\). Again, \\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\( u_{n+1} - v_n = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} - v_n = \\frac{u_n - v_n}{2} = -\\frac{w_n}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( v_{n+1} - v_n = \\frac{ -w_n/2 }{2} = - \\frac{w_n}{4} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( u_{n+1} - u_n = \\frac{w_n}{2} \\), which is positive since \\( w_n > 0 \\). Similarly, \\( v_{n+1} - v_n = - \\frac{w_n}{4} \\), which is negative. \n\nHence, \\( u_n \\) is strictly increasing and \\( v_n \\) is strictly decreasing. Also, \\( v_n - u_n = w_n \\), which converges to zero. Therefore, \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\) are adjacent sequences. \n\nSo, part (b) is done. \n\nPart (c) asks to show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant and find its common limit. \n\nFirst, let's compute \\( t_0 = \\frac{3 + 2*4}{3} = \\frac{3 + 8}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.666... \\). \n\nThen, \\( t_1 = \\frac{u_1 + 2v_1}{3} = \\frac{3.5 + 2*3.75}{3} = \\frac{3.5 + 7.5}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.666... \\). \n\nSo, \\( t_1 = t_0 \\). Let's check if this is true for the general case. \n\nAssume \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\). Then, \\( t_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1}}{3} \\).\n\nCompute \\( u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1} \\):\n\n\\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\n\\( v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} + 2*\\frac{u_{n+1} + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= \\( \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} + (u_{n+1} + v_n) \\)\n\n= \\( \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} + u_{n+1} + v_n \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\):\n\n= \\( \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} + \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} + v_n \\)\n\n= \\( (u_n + v_n) + v_n \\)\n\n= \\( u_n + 2v_n \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1} = u_n + 2v_n \\). \n\nThus, \\( t_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1}}{3} = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} = t_n \\). \n\nTherefore, \\( t_n \\) is a constant sequence. \n\nTo find its limit, since \\( t_n \\) is constant, the limit is just \\( t_0 = \\frac{u_0 + 2v_0}{3} = \\frac{3 + 2*4}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.666... \\). \n\nAlternatively, since \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\), and we know that \\( u_n \\to l \\) and \\( v_n \\to l \\), then \\( t_n \\to \\frac{l + 2l}{3} = l \\). So, the limit is \\( l \\), which is the same as the limit of \\( u_n \\) and \\( v_n \\). \n\nTherefore, part (c) is done. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. Proved that \\( v_n - u_n \\) is decreasing and all terms are positive, hence converges to zero. Therefore, both sequences converge and are adjacent, with the same limit.\n\n2. For Exercise 2:\n\n   a) Showed that \\( w_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{4} w_n \\), hence geometric with ratio 1/4.\n\n   b) Demonstrated that \\( u_n \\) is increasing and \\( v_n \\) is decreasing, hence adjacent.\n\n   c) Proved that \\( t_n \\) is constant by showing \\( t_{n+1} = t_n \\), and found the limit to be \\( \\frac{11}{3} \\).\n\nI think that covers all parts. Let me check if there are any gaps. \n\nIn Exercise 1, for part 3, the theorem is to show adjacent sequences converge to the same limit, which we've done by proving that the difference sequence is decreasing and positive, hence converges to zero, so the terms \\( v_n - u_n \\) go to zero, hence \\( u_n \\) and \\( v_n \\) must converge to the same limit. \n\nIn Exercise 2, part (a) involved computing the first few terms and noticing the geometric ratio. Then, generalizing using induction or algebraic manipulation. \n\nPart (b) required showing the sequences are increasing/decreasing and the difference tends to zero, which we did by expressing \\( u_{n+1} - u_n \\) and \\( v_{n+1} -", "answer": "\\textbf{c.}  \nPour tout entier naturel \\( n \\),  \n\\[\nt_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1}}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{2} + 2\\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{2}}{3} = \\frac{u_n + v_n + u_n + v_n}{3} = \\frac{2u_n + v_n + v_n}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSoit  \n\\[\nt_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{3} = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} = t_n.\n\\]\nLa suite \\( (t_n) \\) est donc constante et, pour tout entier naturel \\( n \\),  \n\\[\nt_n = t_0 = \\frac{11}{3}.\n\\]\n\nOr, par somme et produit,  \n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n = \\frac{l + 2 \\times l}{3} = l \\quad \\text{donc} \\quad l = \\frac{11}{3}.\n\\]\n"}

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the definitions of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\). Both start with \\( u_0 = 3 \\) and \\( v_0 = 4 \\). The recursive relations are:\n\nFor \\( u_{n+1} \\): \\( u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( v_{n+1} \\): \\( v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\)\n\nWait a second, both sequences have the same recursive formula. So at each step, both the next term of \\( u \\) and the next term of \\( v \\) are the average of the previous \\( u_n \\) and \\( v_n \\). That seems interesting. So they are defined in a symmetric way. Hmm, maybe this symmetry helps in showing that \\( t_n \\) is constant.\n\nBut first, let me check if that's actually the case. Let me compute the first few terms to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with \\( u_0 = 3 \\), \\( v_0 = 4 \\).\n\nCompute \\( u_1 = \\frac{u_0 + v_0}{2} = \\frac{3 + 4}{2} = 3.5 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( v_1 = \\frac{u_0 + v_0}{2} = 3.5 \\)\n\nSo \\( u_1 = v_1 = 3.5 \\)\n\nThen \\( u_2 = \\frac{3.5 + 3.5}{2} = 3.5 \\), same for \\( v_2 \\). So both sequences are constant from the start. Wait, so \\( u_n = 3.5 \\) for all n ≥ 1, and \\( v_n = 3.5 \\) for all n ≥ 1. Then the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) would be \\( \\frac{3.5 + 2*3.5}{3} = \\frac{3.5 + 7}{3} = \\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \\). So that would be constant. But wait, the problem statement says \"Show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant...\", so maybe I need to formalize this?\n\nWait, but if both sequences are constant starting from n=1, then t_n would be constant for all n ≥ 1. But the problem mentions \"the sequence \\( t_n \\)\", so perhaps starting from n=0? Let's check n=0.\n\nFor n=0: \\( t_0 = \\frac{u_0 + 2v_0}{3} = \\frac{3 + 8}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} ≈ 3.666... \\)\n\nBut according to the recursive definitions, u_1 = v_1 = 3.5, so t_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5. So t_1 is 3.5, while t_0 is approximately 3.666. So unless the problem defines t_0 as part of the sequence, but maybe the problem is considering n starting from 1. But the way it's written, \"the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\)\", so n starts at 0. So we need to check t_0, t_1, t_2, etc., and see if they are constant.\n\nBut in my calculation, t_1 is 3.5, which is equal to t_0. Wait, t_0 was (3 + 2*4)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666..., and t_1 is 3.5. So they are not equal. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial terms.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nu_0 = 3\n\nv_0 = 4\n\nt_0 = (3 + 2*4)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nu_1 = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5\n\nv_1 = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5\n\nt_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nSo t_1 = 3.5, which is different from t_0. So unless the problem defines n starting from 1, but the question says \"the sequence t_n\", which typically starts at n=0. So there must be an error here. Wait, maybe the problem is in the recursive definitions.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\nYes, the recursive definitions are:\n\nFor all integers n, u_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSimilarly for v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSo both sequences are defined by the same recurrence relation, but starting with u_0 = 3 and v_0 = 4. So according to this, u_1 = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5, v_1 = 3.5, then u_2 = (3.5 + 3.5)/2 = 3.5, v_2 = 3.5, etc. So both sequences are constant from n=1 onward. Therefore, t_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3. For n=0, t_0 = (3 + 2*4)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666..., for n=1, t_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5. So t_0 ≠ t_1. So the sequence t_n is not constant. But the problem says \"Show that the sequence t_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3 is constant\". That contradicts my calculations. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem or there is a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant. Deduce the common limit of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\).\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the recursive definitions. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nFor all integers n, u_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSimilarly for v_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2\n\nSo both u and v sequences are defined the same way, but starting with different initial terms. Wait, but the problem is asking about the sequence t_n = (u_n + 2v_n)/3. So even if u and v are both constant from n=1, but t_n would be (u + 2v)/3. If u and v are constants, then t_n is constant. But here, t_0 is different from t_1. So unless there is a typo in the problem, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant. Deduce the common limit of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\).\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but my calculations are wrong. Let me check again.\n\nCompute t_0: (3 + 2*4)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nt_1: (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nt_2: (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = same as t_1, 3.5\n\nSo t_0 is 11/3, t_1 is 3.5, t_2 is 3.5, etc. So t_n is not constant. So either the problem is wrong, or I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the initial terms. Let me check:\n\nu_0 = 3, v_0 = 4. Then t_0 = (3 + 2*4)/3 = 11/3. Then u_1 and v_1 are both 3.5, so t_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = 3.5. So unless the problem is considering n starting from 1, then t_n would be constant. But the problem says \"the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\)\", so starting from n=0. Therefore, there is a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the definition of t_n. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but my calculations are wrong. Let me check again:\n\nt_0 = (3 + 2*4)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nt_1 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nt_2 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = same as t_1, 3.5\n\nSo unless the problem is considering n starting from 1, which is not the case, t_n is not constant. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant. Deduce the common limit of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\).\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the initial terms, but about the limit? But the problem defines the sequences with initial terms u_0 = 3 and v_0 = 4. So perhaps there is a typo in the problem, or maybe the sequences are different. Wait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Let the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\) be defined by:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nu_0 = 3 \\\\\n\\text{for all integer } n, \\, u_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\quadquad\n\\begin{cases}\nv_0 = 4 \\\\\n\\text{for all integer } n, \\, v_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n}{2} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nShow that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant. Deduce the common limit of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\).\"\n\nWait, so the problem defines both u and v sequences with their own recursive relations, but both have the same recurrence relation except for the starting values. So u_0 = 3, v_0 = 4, and then for each n ≥ 0, u_{n+1} = (u_n + v_n)/2, and similarly for v_{n+1}. So both sequences are defined by the same recurrence, but with different initial terms. Therefore, unless there's some interaction between u and v, their terms can behave differently. But according to the initial calculations, u and v become equal after n=1, so from n=1 onwards, both sequences are constant. Therefore, t_n would be (constant + 2*constant)/3 = constant. But t_0 is different. Therefore, unless the problem is considering n starting from 1, which would make t_n constant, but the problem says \"the sequence \\( t_n \\)\", which typically starts at n=0. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check t_0 again:\n\nt_0 = (u_0 + 2v_0)/3 = (3 + 8)/3 = 11/3 ≈ 3.666...\n\nt_1 = (u_1 + 2v_1)/3 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = (3.5 + 7)/3 = 10.5/3 = 3.5\n\nt_2 = (3.5 + 2*3.5)/3 = same as t_1, 3.5\n\nSo unless the problem is considering n starting from 1, but the problem says \"the sequence \\( t_n \\)\", which is standard starting at n=0. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the initial terms, but about the limit. Let me check the problem's original statement again:\n\n\"Show that the sequence \\( t_n = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} \\) is constant. Deduce the common limit of the sequences \\( (u_n) \\) and \\( (v_n) \\).\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, but I need to adjust the initial terms. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the sequences are defined. Let me see: both u and v are defined by the same recurrence relation, but with different starting points. So the sequences are not independent. Therefore, unless there's a relation between u_n and v_n that I'm missing, their terms will interact. However, according to the initial calculations, u and v become equal after n=1, which would mean that from n=1 onward, both sequences are constant. Therefore, t_n would be constant from n=1 onward. But t_0 is different, so unless the problem is considering n starting from 1, which would make t_n constant. Therefore, perhaps there is a typo in the problem, or maybe the problem is correct, but I need to proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the limit of t", "answer": "\\textbf{c.}  \nPour tout entier naturel \\( n \\),  \n\\[\nt_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1} + 2v_{n+1}}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{2} + 2\\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{2}}{3} = \\frac{u_n + v_n + u_n + v_n}{3} = \\frac{2u_n + v_n + v_n}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSoit  \n\\[\nt_{n+1} = \\frac{u_n + v_n + v_n}{3} = \\frac{u_n + 2v_n}{3} = t_n.\n\\]\nLa suite \\( (t_n) \\) est donc constante et, pour tout entier naturel \\( n \\),  \n\\[\nt_n = t_0 = \\frac{11}{3}.\n\\]\n\nOr, par somme et produit,  \n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n = \\frac{l + 2 \\times l}{3} = l \\quad \\text{donc} \\quad l = \\frac{11}{3}.\n\\]\n"}

Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I need to find a and b where when you compute a⁴ plus four times b⁴, the result is prime. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, let's consider small values of a and b because primes are usually smaller, but maybe there are some larger values where a⁴ + 4b⁴ still results in a prime. Let me try plugging in some numbers.\n\nLet's start with b = 1. Then the expression becomes a⁴ + 4*1 = a⁴ + 4. Let's check for small a:\n\na = 1: 1 + 4 = 5, which is prime. So (1,1) is a solution.\n\na = 2: 16 + 4 = 20, which is not prime.\n\na = 3: 81 + 4 = 85, not prime.\n\na = 4: 256 + 4 = 260, not prime.\n\nSo when b=1, only a=1 works.\n\nNow let's try b=2. Then the expression is a⁴ + 4*(16) = a⁴ + 64. Let's check small a:\n\na=1: 1 + 64 = 65, not prime.\n\na=2: 16 + 64 = 80, not prime.\n\na=3: 81 + 64 = 145, not prime.\n\na=4: 256 + 64 = 320, not prime.\n\nHmm, not promising. Maybe b=2 doesn't work. Let's try b=3. Then the expression is a⁴ + 4*81 = a⁴ + 324.\n\nCheck a=1: 1 + 324 = 325, not prime.\n\na=2: 16 + 324 = 340, not prime.\n\na=3: 81 + 324 = 405, not prime.\n\na=4: 256 + 324 = 580, not prime.\n\nStill nothing. Maybe b=0? Wait, the problem says nonzero natural numbers, so b can't be 0. So starting from b=1.\n\nWait, maybe b=1 is the only possible case? Let's check b=1 again with a=1. That works. What about a=1 and b=0? But b has to be nonzero. So maybe a=1, b=1 is the only solution. But let's verify that.\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. The expression a⁴ + 4b⁴. This looks similar to the Sophie Germain identity, which factors expressions of the form a⁴ + 4b⁴. Let me recall that identity. The Sophie Germain identity states that a⁴ + 4b⁴ = (a² + 2ab + 2b²)(a² - 2ab + 2b²). Let me verify that:\n\nMultiply (a² + 2ab + 2b²)(a² - 2ab + 2b²):\n\nFirst term: a²*a² = a⁴\n\nOuter terms: a²*(-2ab) = -2a³b\n\nInner terms: a²*2b² = 2a²b²\n\nThen: 2ab*a² = 2a³b\n\n2ab*(-2ab) = -4a²b²\n\n2ab*2b² = 4ab³\n\nThen: 2b²*a² = 2a²b²\n\n2b²*(-2ab) = -4ab³\n\n2b²*2b² = 4b⁴\n\nNow combine all terms:\n\na⁴ -2a³b + 2a²b² + 2a³b -4a²b² +4ab³ + 2a²b² -4ab³ +4b⁴\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\na⁴ + (-2a³b + 2a³b) + (2a²b² -4a²b² +2a²b²) + (4ab³ -4ab³) +4b⁴\n\nSimplifies to:\n\na⁴ + 0a³b + 0a²b² + 0ab³ +4b⁴ = a⁴ +4b⁴\n\nYes, the identity holds. So, a⁴ +4b⁴ factors into (a² + 2ab + 2b²)(a² - 2ab + 2b²). Therefore, if a⁴ +4b⁴ is prime, then one of the factors must be 1 and the other must be the prime itself. Since a and b are natural numbers, both factors are positive integers greater than 1 (since a and b are nonzero). Therefore, one of the factors must equal 1, and the other must equal the prime.\n\nSo, let's set up equations:\n\nCase 1: a² + 2ab + 2b² = 1\n\nCase 2: a² - 2ab + 2b² = 1\n\nBut since a and b are positive integers, let's see if these equations have solutions.\n\nStarting with Case 1: a² + 2ab + 2b² = 1\n\nSince a and b are positive integers, the smallest possible values are a=1, b=1. Let's plug in a=1, b=1:\n\n1 + 2*1*1 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 ≠ 1. So no solution here. Similarly, any a or b larger than 1 would make the left-hand side larger. So no solutions in Case 1.\n\nCase 2: a² - 2ab + 2b² = 1\n\nAgain, test small values. Let's try a=1, b=1:\n\n1 - 2*1*1 + 2*1 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Hey, that works. So when a=1, b=1, the equation holds. Therefore, one of the factors is 1, and the other is 5, which is prime. So that's the solution we found earlier: (1,1).\n\nNow let's check other possible values for a and b. Suppose a=2, b=1:\n\na² - 2ab + 2b² = 4 - 4 + 2 = 2 ≠1. Not 1.\n\na=2, b=2:\n\n4 - 8 + 8 = 4 ≠1.\n\na=3, b=1:\n\n9 -6 +2 =5≠1.\n\na=3, b=2:\n\n9 -12 +8=5≠1.\n\na=1, b=2:\n\n1 -4 +8=5≠1.\n\nSo seems like only a=1, b=1 gives 1 in Case 2. Therefore, the only solution is (1,1). Wait, but let's check if there are other possibilities where one factor is 1 and the other is prime.\n\nBut we already saw that in Case 1, there's no solution. In Case 2, only (1,1) works. Therefore, the only solution is a=1, b=1.\n\nBut let me test another case where maybe the factors are not 1 and prime, but both are primes. Wait, but according to the factorization, a⁴ +4b⁴ factors into two integers greater than 1. So if a⁴ +4b⁴ is prime, then one of the factors must be 1, and the other must be the prime. Therefore, the only possible solution is when one factor is 1, which only happens when a=1, b=1.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with a=1, b=1:\n\n1⁴ +4*(1)⁴=1 +4=5, which is prime. Correct.\n\nAre there any other possibilities where a and b are larger, but one of the factors is 1? Let's suppose that a² + 2ab + 2b² =1. As we saw, this equation has no solutions because even for a=1, b=1, it's 5, and increasing a or b would make it larger. Similarly, for the other factor a² - 2ab + 2b²=1, only a=1, b=1 works. So that seems to be the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe there's a case where one factor is -1, but since a and b are natural numbers, the factors would be positive, so no. So the only possible case is when one factor is 1 and the other is the prime. Therefore, the only solution is a=1, b=1.\n\nBut let's check if maybe one of the factors is -1, but since a and b are natural numbers, all terms are positive, so the factors are positive. Therefore, no negative factors. So yes, only the case where one factor is 1 and the other is prime.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is (1,1). But wait, let's check a=1, b=2:\n\n1⁴ +4*(2)⁴=1 + 4*16=65. 65 is 5*13, not prime.\n\na=2, b=1: 16 +4=20, not prime.\n\na=3, b=1: 81 +4=85, not prime.\n\na=1, b=3:1 +4*81=325, not prime.\n\na=2, b=2: 16 +4*16=16+64=80, not prime.\n\na=3, b=2:81 +4*16=81+64=145, not prime.\n\na=4, b=1:256 +4=260, not prime.\n\na=2, b=3:16 +4*81=16+324=340, not prime.\n\na=3, b=3:81 +4*81=81+324=405, not prime.\n\na=4, b=2:256 +4*16=256+64=320, not prime.\n\na=4, b=3:256 +4*81=256+324=580, not prime.\n\na=5, b=1:625 +4=629. Is 629 prime? Let's check. 629 divided by 17: 17*37=629. Yes, 17*37=629, so not prime.\n\na=1, b=4:1 +4*256=1 +1024=1025. 1025 ends with 5, divisible by 5. Not prime.\n\nSo, seems like no other solutions. Therefore, (1,1) is the only solution.\n\nBut wait, let me check a=1, b=0. But b has to be nonzero, so that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where both factors are primes, but since their product is a prime, one must be 1. So that's covered.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is a=1, b=1.\n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. Suppose a and b are such that a² - 2ab + 2b²=1 and a² + 2ab + 2b² is also prime. But since the product is prime, one factor must be 1, so only one of them can be 1. So, in the case where a² - 2ab + 2b²=1, we found a=1, b=1. Then the other factor is 5, which is prime. If we tried other a and b where a² -2ab +2b²=1, we saw that only a=1, b=1 works.\n\nSimilarly, for a² +2ab +2b²=1, which has no solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is (1,1).\n\nBut let me check if there are any other possible factorizations or mathematical properties I haven't considered. For example, are there any cases where both factors are primes, but their product is prime? But primes have only two positive divisors: 1 and themselves. So if the product of two numbers is prime, one of them must be 1. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Hence, only when one factor is 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the only solution is a=1, b=1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only solution is \\boxed{a = 1} and \\boxed{b = 1}, so written in boxed form as \\boxed{(1, 1)}.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

I need to find the value of u_{2023} in this sequence defined by u_1 = 2 and the recursive formula u_{n+1} = 1 - 1/u_n. Hmm, recursive sequences can sometimes be tricky, especially when they involve fractions. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe it's helpful to compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. Let's start with u_1 given as 2.\n\nThen, u_2 would be 1 - 1/u_1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Okay, so u_2 is 1/2.\n\nNext, u_3 is 1 - 1/u_2. Since u_2 is 1/2, 1/u_2 is 2, so u_3 = 1 - 2 = -1. Wait, that's negative. Hmm, maybe the sequence can become negative? Let's keep going.\n\nu_4 = 1 - 1/u_3. But u_3 is -1, so 1/u_3 is -1, hence u_4 = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Wait a minute, u_4 is back to 2. That's the same as u_1. Let me check that again.\n\nStarting from u_1 = 2:\n\nu_1 = 2\n\nu_2 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nu_3 = 1 - 1/(1/2) = 1 - 2 = -1\n\nu_4 = 1 - 1/(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nu_5 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nu_6 = 1 - 1/(1/2) = -1\n\nu_7 = 1 - 1/(-1) = 2\n\nWait, so starting from u_1, we have a cycle: 2, 1/2, -1, 2, 1/2, -1, and so on. So the sequence is periodic with period 3. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom u_1 to u_4: 2, 1/2, -1, 2. Then u_5 is 1/2 again, which is the same as u_2. So yes, the cycle is 3 terms long: 2, 1/2, -1, 2, 1/2, -1, etc.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is periodic with period 3. So every 3 terms it repeats. To find u_{2023}, I need to see where 2023 falls in this cycle.\n\nTo do that, I can divide 2023 by 3 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me the position in the cycle. Let's compute 2023 divided by 3.\n\n3 × 674 = 2022, so 2023 = 3 × 674 + 1. Therefore, the remainder is 1. That means u_{2023} corresponds to the first term in the cycle, which is 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The cycle is u_1 = 2, u_2 = 1/2, u_3 = -1, u_4 = 2, u_5 = 1/2, u_6 = -1, etc. So each time the remainder corresponds to the term. Since 2023 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 674 with a remainder of 1, that means u_{2023} is the same as u_1, which is 2. So the answer should be 2.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe using modular arithmetic. If the sequence is periodic with period 3, then u_{n} = u_{n mod 3}, adjusting for the starting index. Since the cycle starts at n=1, we can write:\n\nIf n ≡ 1 mod 3, then u_n = 2\n\nIf n ≡ 2 mod 3, then u_n = 1/2\n\nIf n ≡ 0 mod 3, then u_n = -1\n\nSo for n=2023, let's compute 2023 divided by 3:\n\n3 × 674 = 2022, so 2023 = 3×674 +1. Therefore, 2023 ≡1 mod 3. Hence, u_{2023}=2. That confirms the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the sequence cycles every 3 terms. So the terms repeat every 3 steps. Therefore, the value at term number k is the same as term k modulo 3. Since 2023 mod 3 is 1, the value is the same as the first term in the cycle, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, u_{2023} = 2.\n\nI think this makes sense. Let me check if there's any mistake in assuming the period. Let's recompute a few terms to confirm.\n\nu1=2\n\nu2=1 -1/2=1/2\n\nu3=1 -1/(1/2)=1 -2=-1\n\nu4=1 -1/(-1)=1 +1=2\n\nu5=1 -1/2=1/2\n\nu6=1 -1/(1/2)=-1\n\nu7=1 -1/(-1)=2\n\nYes, so the cycle is indeed 2, 1/2, -1, and repeats every 3 terms. So the period is 3. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's compute u_{3k+1}, u_{3k+2}, u_{3k+3} for k=0,1,...\n\nFor k=0: 3(0)+1=1: u1=2; 3(0)+2=2: u2=1/2; 3(0)+3=3: u3=-1\n\nFor k=1: 3(1)+1=4: u4=2; 3(1)+2=5: u5=1/2; 3(1)+3=6: u6=-1\n\nYes, so the same pattern holds. Therefore, the general formula for u_n is:\n\nIf n ≡1 mod3, then u_n=2\n\nIf n≡2 mod3, then u_n=1/2\n\nIf n≡0 mod3, then u_n=-1\n\nSo 2023 divided by 3 is 674 with remainder 1, so n≡1 mod3, so u_{2023}=2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2. I think this is solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French. I can guess that the user will prefer an French response.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some number theory concepts. \n\nFirst, the number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number N can be factored into primes as N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the number of divisors of N is (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*...*(an + 1). So, for a number to have exactly 6 distinct divisors, the product of one more than each exponent in its prime factorization must equal 6.\n\nNow, 6 factors can be written as 6*1 or 2*3. So, the possible factorizations for the product (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*... would be either a single prime raised to the 5th power (since 5 + 1 = 6) or two primes where one is squared (since (2 + 1)*(1 + 1) = 3*2 = 6). Wait, actually, 6 can also be written as 6*1, which would correspond to a prime raised to the 5th power, or 3*2, which would correspond to two primes where one is squared and the other is to the first power. So, the number N must be either a fifth power of a prime or the product of a prime squared and another prime.\n\nTherefore, p^2 + 11 must be either a fifth power of a prime or the product of a square of a prime and another distinct prime. \n\nSo, let's consider both cases separately.\n\nFirst case: p^2 + 11 = q^5, where q is a prime number. \n\nSecond case: p^2 + 11 = q^2 * r, where q and r are distinct primes.\n\nOur task is to find all primes p such that either of these equations hold.\n\nLet me tackle the first case first.\n\nCase 1: p^2 + 11 = q^5.\n\nWe need to find primes p and q such that when we add 11 to p squared, we get a fifth power of a prime. Let's consider possible primes q and see if p is also a prime.\n\nFirst, let's note that q^5 must be greater than p^2 + 11, so q^5 > p^2. Since p is a prime, let's try small primes q and see if q^5 - 11 is a perfect square of a prime.\n\nLet's start with q = 2. Then q^5 = 32. 32 - 11 = 21. Is 21 a square of a prime? 21 is not a square, and its square root is not an integer. So, no.\n\nNext, q = 3. 3^5 = 243. 243 - 11 = 232. 232 is not a perfect square. The square root of 232 is approximately 15.23, not an integer. So, no.\n\nq = 5. 5^5 = 3125. 3125 - 11 = 3114. That's way too big; even if p is 7, 7^2 = 49, so 49 + 11 = 60, which is way smaller than 3114. So, q=5 is too large here. Let's check q=2,3,5,7,11,... but seems unlikely. Maybe q=7?\n\nWait, 7^5 is 16807. 16807 - 11 = 16796. Hmm, is 16796 a square? Let's check. The square root of 16796 is approx 129.6, which is not an integer. So, nope. \n\nAlternatively, maybe q=2? Wait, already tried that. Maybe q=11? 11^5 is 161051. 161051 - 11 = 161040. Square root is around 401.3, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps q=13? 13^5 is 371293. 371293 -11=371282. Square root is approx 609.3, not an integer. So, seems like for q >=2, q^5 -11 is not a perfect square. Therefore, maybe there are no solutions in the first case?\n\nWait, let's check q=2: 32 -11=21. 21 is 3*7, not a square. q=3: 243-11=232=8*29. Not a square. q=5: 3125-11=3114. 3114=2*3*519, not a square. q=7: 16807-11=16796. 16796 divided by 4 is 4199, which is not a square. So, no. Maybe q= next prime? 11^5 is way too big, as above. So, seems like there are no solutions in the first case.\n\nTherefore, Case 1: p^2 +11 is a fifth power of a prime. No solutions.\n\nNow, moving to Case 2: p^2 +11 = q^2 * r, where q and r are distinct primes.\n\nSo, we need p^2 +11 to be the product of a square of a prime and another distinct prime. Let's think about possible primes q and r.\n\nLet’s note that q^2 * r must be greater than p^2 +11, but since p is a prime, perhaps q and r are small primes. Let's try small primes for q and r.\n\nFirst, let's list possible q and r. Let's start with q=2.\n\nIf q=2, then q^2=4. So, 4*r = p^2 +11. So, p^2 =4r -11. We need 4r -11 to be a square of a prime. Let's try small primes r:\n\nr=2: 4*2 -11=8-11=-3. Not possible.\n\nr=3: 4*3 -11=12-11=1. 1 is 1^2, but 1 is not prime. So no.\n\nr=5: 4*5 -11=20-11=9. 9 is 3^2. So, p^2=9, p=3. So, p=3. So, 3 is a prime. Let's check: 3^2 +11=9+11=20. 20 factors into 2^2 *5. So, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1)=3*2=6. Yes! So, 3 is a solution.\n\nSo, p=3 is a solution.\n\nNext, r=7: 4*7 -11=28-11=17. 17 is prime, not a square. So, p^2=17. Not a square.\n\nr=11: 4*11 -11=44-11=33. Not a square.\n\nr=13: 4*13 -11=52-11=41. Prime. Not a square.\n\nr=17: 4*17 -11=68-11=57. Not a square.\n\nr=19: 4*19 -11=76-11=65. Not a square.\n\nSimilarly, higher primes for r would give p^2=4r -11. Let's see if 4r -11 is a square. Let's solve 4r = p^2 +11. So, r=(p^2 +11)/4. Since r must be a prime, (p^2 +11) must be divisible by 4. Let's check p^2 modulo 4. For any prime p, if p is odd, p^2 is 1 mod 4. If p=2, p^2=0 mod 4. So, p=2: let's check p=2. Then p^2 +11=4 +11=15. 15=4*r. Then r=15/4=3.75. Not integer. So, p=2 is not a solution.\n\nFor odd primes p, p^2 ≡1 mod4, so p^2 +11 ≡1 +11=12≡0 mod4. So, 4 divides p^2 +11, so r=(p^2 +11)/4 is integer. So, for odd primes, p^2 +11 is divisible by 4, so r is integer. Then, we need r to be prime.\n\nSo, for odd primes p, r=(p^2 +11)/4. Let's check for which primes p, this r is prime.\n\nLet's try p=3: already done, r=(9+11)/4=20/4=5, which is prime. So, 3 is a solution.\n\np=5: (25 +11)/4=36/4=9. 9 is not prime.\n\np=7: (49 +11)/4=60/4=15. Not prime.\n\np=11: (121 +11)/4=132/4=33. Not prime.\n\np=13: (169 +11)/4=180/4=45. Not prime.\n\np=17: (289 +11)/4=300/4=75. Not prime.\n\np=19: (361 +11)/4=372/4=93. Not prime.\n\np=23: (529 +11)/4=540/4=135. Not prime.\n\np=29: (841 +11)/4=852/4=213. Not prime.\n\nHmm, seems like only p=3 gives a prime r here.\n\nBut wait, let's check higher primes. Maybe p=7: r=15, not prime. p=11: r=33, not prime. So, maybe only p=3 in this case.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another case. Let's also check q=3. So, q=3, q^2=9. Then, 9*r = p^2 +11. So, p^2=9r -11. Let's try small primes r:\n\nr=2: 9*2 -11=18-11=7. 7 is prime. So, p^2=7. Not a square.\n\nr=3: 9*3 -11=27-11=16. 16 is 4^2. So, p^2=16. p=4. Not prime.\n\nr=5: 9*5 -11=45-11=34. Not a square.\n\nr=7: 9*7 -11=63-11=52. Not a square.\n\nr=11: 9*11 -11=99-11=88. Not a square.\n\nr=13: 9*13 -11=117-11=106. Not a square.\n\nr=17: 9*17 -11=153-11=142. Not a square.\n\nr=19: 9*19 -11=171-11=160. Not a square.\n\nr=23: 9*23 -11=207-11=196. 196 is 14^2. So, p^2=196, p=14. Not prime.\n\nWait, 196 is 14 squared, but p has to be prime. So, 14 is not prime. So, no solution here.\n\nr=29: 9*29 -11=261-11=250. Not a square.\n\nr=31: 9*31 -11=279-11=268. Not a square.\n\nHmm, so for q=3, r=17 gives p=14, not prime. r=23 gives p=14 as well. Wait, 9*23=207. 207-11=196. 196 is 14 squared. So, p=14, which is not prime. So, no solution here.\n\nNext, q=5. Then q^2=25. So, 25*r = p^2 +11. Thus, p^2=25r -11. So, p^2 +11 must be divisible by 25. Let's check if 25 divides p^2 +11. For primes p, let's check modulo 25.\n\nIf p is a prime greater than 5, then p is co-prime to 25. So, p^2 modulo 25 can be 1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24. Let's see if any of these are congruent to -11 mod25. That is, p^2 ≡14 mod25. But wait, 25 divides p^2 +11, so p^2 ≡ -11 mod25. Let's compute -11 mod25 is 14. So, p^2 ≡14 mod25. But as above, the quadratic residues modulo 25 are as listed. Let's check if 14 is a quadratic residue mod25.\n\nQuadratic residues modulo 25 are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24. So, 14 is a quadratic residue modulo 25. Therefore, there exist primes p where p^2 ≡14 mod25, hence p^2 +11 ≡0 mod25. So, possible.\n\nBut how does that help us", "answer": "Si \\( p \\neq 3 \\), il existe un entier \\( k \\) tel que \\( p = 3k - 1 \\) ou \\( p = 3k + 1 \\).  \nAlors \\( (p - 1)(p + 1) = (3k - 2)(3k) \\) ou \\( (p - 1)(p + 1) = 3k(3k + 2) \\) et dans les deux cas \\( 3 \\) divise \\( p^2 - 1 \\) donc \\( 3 \\) divise \\( p^2 - 1 + 12 = p^2 + 11 \\).\n\nSi \\( p \\neq 2 \\), comme \\( p \\) est un nombre premier, \\( p \\) est impair donc il existe un entier \\( k \\) tel que \\( p = 2k + 1 \\).  \nAlors \\( (p - 1)(p + 1) = 2k(2k + 2) = 4k(k + 1) \\) et \\( 4 \\) divise \\( p^2 - 1 \\) donc \\( 4 \\) divise \\( p^2 - 1 + 12 = p^2 + 11 \\).\n\nSi \\( p \\neq 3 \\) et \\( p \\neq 2 \\), alors, comme \\( 3 \\) et \\( 4 \\) sont premiers entre eux, \\( 12 \\) divise \\( p^2 + 11 \\).  \nOr \\( 12 \\) admet exactement 6 diviseurs : \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \\).  \nComme \\( p > 1 \\), \\( p^2 + 11 > 12 \\) et donc \\( p^2 + 11 \\) admet plus de 6 diviseurs.\n\nSi \\( p = 2 \\), \\( p^2 + 11 = 15 \\).

So, I need to list all three-digit perfect squares first and then check their reverses to see if they are also perfect squares.\n\nFirst, let me list all the three-digit numbers that are perfect squares. The smallest three-digit number is 100, which is 10 squared. The largest three-digit number is 999. Let's find the square roots of 100 and 999 to determine the range of integers whose squares are three-digit numbers. The square root of 100 is 10, and the square root of 999 is approximately 31.606.

Let me write them down:\n\n10² = 100\n\n11² = 121\n\n12² = 144\n\n13² = 169\n\n14² = 196\n\n15² = 225\n\n16² = 256\n\n17² = 289\n\n18² = 324\n\n19² = 361\n\n20² = 400\n\n21² = 441\n\n22² = 484\n\n23² = 529\n\n24² = 576\n\n25² = 625\n\n26² = 676\n\n27² = 729\n\n28² = 784\n\n29² = 841\n\n30² = 900\n\n31² = 961\n\nSo these are all the three-digit perfect squares. Now, I need to take each of these, reverse their digits, and check if the reversed number is also a perfect square. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with 100: Reverse is 001. But leading zeros aren't allowed in numbers, so 001 isn't a valid three-digit number. So 100 is out.\n\nNext, 121. Reverse is 121. Wait, that's the same number. But 121 is already a three-digit number. Is 121 a perfect square? Yes, 11². So reversing 121 gives itself, which is a perfect square. That seems like a candidate. But wait, let me confirm. 121 reversed is 121, which is 11². So that works. Hmm, is that the answer? Wait, but maybe there are others. Let me check the rest.\n\n144 reversed is 441. Is 441 a perfect square? Let's see. 21² is 441. Yes. So 144 reversed is 441, which is 21². So that works too. So 144 and 441 are both perfect squares when reversed. Interesting.\n\n169 reversed is 961. Is 961 a perfect square? Let's check. 31² is 961. Yes, because 30² is 900, so 31² is 961. So 169 reversed is 961, which is 31². So that's another one. So 169 and 961 are both perfect squares.\n\n225 reversed is 522. Is 522 a perfect square? Let's see. 22² is 484, 23² is 529. So 522 is between 484 and 529, not a perfect square. So 225 is out.\n\n256 reversed is 652. 25² is 625, 26² is 676. 652 is not a perfect square. So 256 is out.\n\n289 reversed is 982. 31² is 961, 32² is 1024. 982 is not a perfect square. So 289 is out.\n\n324 reversed is 423. 20² is 400, 21² is 441. 423 is not a perfect square. So 324 is out.\n\n361 reversed is 163. 12² is 144, 13² is 169. 163 is not a perfect square. So 361 is out.\n\n400 reversed is 004. Again, leading zeros, so not a three-digit number. So 400 is out.\n\n441 reversed is 144. Wait, 144 is a perfect square. So 441 reversed is 144, which is 12². So that's another one. So 441 and 144 are both perfect squares.\n\n529 reversed is 925. 28² is 784, 29² is 841, 30² is 900, 31² is 961. 925 is not a perfect square. So 529 is out.\n\n625 reversed is 526. 22² is 484, 23² is 529. 526 is not a perfect square. So 625 is out.\n\n676 reversed is 676. Same number. 676 is 26². So reversing 676 gives itself. So that's another one. So 676 and 676 are both perfect squares. Wait, but 676 reversed is 676. That's a palindrome. So that's another one. So 676 is a candidate.\n\n784 reversed is 487. 21² is 441, 22² is 484, 23² is 529. 487 is not a perfect square. So 784 is out.\n\n841 reversed is 148. 10² is 100, 11² is 121, 12² is 144, 13² is 169. 148 is not a perfect square. So 841 is out.\n\n900 reversed is 009. Leading zeros, not a three-digit number. So 900 is out.\n\n961 reversed is 169. Which is 13². So 961 reversed is 169, which is 13². So that's another one. So 961 and 169 are both perfect squares.\n\nWait, let me summarize all the ones I found:\n\n144 reversed: 441 (11²)\n\n169 reversed: 961 (31²)\n\n441 reversed: 144 (12²)\n\n676 reversed: 676 (26²)\n\n961 reversed: 169 (13²)\n\nSo these are the pairs where the reversed number is also a perfect square. Now, the question is asking for a square perfect of 3 digits that when reversed becomes another perfect square. So all these pairs are valid. But the question might be looking for a specific one, or maybe all possible ones. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, let's list all the 3-digit perfect squares and check each one:\n\n100: reverse is 001 (invalid)\n\n121: reverse is 121 (11²)\n\n144: reverse is 441 (21²)\n\n169: reverse is 961 (31²)\n\n196: reverse is 691. 26² is 676, 27² is 729. 691 is not a perfect square.\n\n225: reverse is 522. 22² is 484, 23² is 529. Not a perfect square.\n\n256: reverse is 652. 25² is 625, 26² is 676. Not a perfect square.\n\n289: reverse is 982. 31² is 961, 32² is 1024. Not a perfect square.\n\n324: reverse is 423. 20² is 400, 21² is 441. Not a perfect square.\n\n361: reverse is 163. 12² is 144, 13² is 169. Not a perfect square.\n\n400: reverse is 004 (invalid)\n\n441: reverse is 144 (12²)\n\n484: reverse is 484 (22²)\n\n529: reverse is 925. 30² is 900, 31² is 961. Not a perfect square.\n\n576: reverse is 675. 25² is 625, 26² is 676. Not a perfect square.\n\n625: reverse is 526. 22² is 484, 23² is 529. Not a perfect square.\n\n676: reverse is 676 (26²)\n\n729: reverse is 927. 30² is 900, 31² is 961. Not a perfect square.\n\n784: reverse is 487. 21² is 441, 22² is 484, 23² is 529. Not a perfect square.\n\n841: reverse is 148. 10² is 100, 11² is 121, 12² is 144, 13² is 169. Not a perfect square.\n\n900: reverse is 009 (invalid)\n\n961: reverse is 169 (13²)\n\nSo the pairs are:\n\n144 ↔ 441\n\n169 ↔ 961\n\n441 ↔ 144\n\n676 ↔ 676\n\n961 ↔ 169\n\nSo these are the possible numbers. Now, the question is asking for \"a square perfect of 3 digits which, when reversed, gives another square.\" So any of these numbers would satisfy the condition. However, if the question is looking for a unique answer, perhaps the largest one or the smallest. Let's check the problem again: \"Find a square perfect of 3 digits which, when reversed, gives another square.\" It doesn't specify if it's the largest, smallest, or any. But maybe the answer expects the largest one or the smallest? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n144, 169, 441, 676, 961, 144, 961, 169.\n\nWait, the pairs are 144 and 441, 169 and 961, 676 is alone. So 676 reversed is itself. So that's another one. So maybe the problem wants all such numbers. But the wording is \"Find a square perfect of 3 digits which, when reversed, gives another square.\" So perhaps any one of them, but maybe the largest. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the list, the largest 3-digit perfect square is 961. Reversing it gives 169, which is also a perfect square. So 961 is a valid answer. Similarly, 441 reversed is 144, 169 reversed is 961, 144 reversed is 441, 676 reversed is 676, and 961 reversed is 169.\n\nSo the numbers are 144, 169, 441, 676, 961. But the problem says \"a square perfect of 3 digits which, when reversed, gives another square.\" So they could be any of them. However, maybe the answer expects all of them, but perhaps the intended answer is the one with the largest number. Let me check if 961 is considered a 3-digit number. Yes, it's 961. So perhaps 961 is the answer they are looking for.\n\nBut let me verify again. Let's list all the 3-digit perfect squares and check their reverses.\n\nFor example:\n\n100: reverse 001 → invalid.\n\n121: 121 → same, so palindrome.\n\n144: 441 → 21².\n\n169: 961 → 31².\n\n196: reverse 691 → not a square.\n\n225: reverse 522 → not a square.\n\n256: 652 → not a square.\n\n289: 982 → not a square.\n\n324: reverse 423 → not a square.\n\n361: reverse 163 → not a square.\n\n400: reverse 004 → invalid.\n\n441: 144 → 12².\n\n484: 484 → same, palindrome.\n\n529: reverse 925 → not a square.\n\n576: reverse 675 → not a square.\n\n625: reverse 526 → not a square.\n\n676: reverse 676 → 26².\n\n729: reverse 927 → not a square.\n\n784: reverse 487 → not a square.\n\n841: reverse 148 → not a square.\n\n900: reverse 009 → invalid.\n\n961: reverse 169 → 13².\n\nSo from this, the numbers that satisfy the condition are 144, 169, 441, 676, 961. But since the question is asking for \"a square perfect of 3 digits which, when reversed, gives another square,\" it", "answer": "On montre déjà que la somme d’un entier ayant un nombre pair de \\textbf{chiffres} et de son « retourné » est un multiple de 11.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the equation involves two variables, a and b, and it's a product of two expressions equal to 1. The expression (a + √(1 + a²)) looks familiar. Maybe it's related to hyperbolic functions or some trigonometric identity? Wait, I remember that expressions of the form (x + √(1 + x²)) can be related to sinh or cosh functions. Let me recall: sinh(θ) = (e^θ - e^(-θ))/2 and cosh(θ) = (e^θ + e^(-θ))/2. Also, cosh(θ) - sinh(θ) = e^(-θ). Maybe there's a connection here. Alternatively, if I set a = sinh(u) or a = tanh(v), since tanh(v) = sinh(2v)/(1 + cosh(2v))... Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to set a = tanh(θ) or something like that. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting variables to simplify the expression. Let me denote x = a + √(1 + a²) and y = b + √(1 + b²). Then the given equation is x * y = 1. So x and y are reciprocals of each other. Also, since x = a + √(1 + a²), perhaps there's a relationship between x and a. Let me solve for a in terms of x. Let's set x = a + √(1 + a²). Let's solve for a:\n\nx = a + √(1 + a²)\n\nLet's isolate the square root:\n\n√(1 + a²) = x - a\n\nThen square both sides:\n\n1 + a² = (x - a)² = x² - 2a x + a²\n\nSubtract a² from both sides:\n\n1 = x² - 2a x\n\nThen rearrange:\n\n2a x = x² - 1\n\nSo a = (x² - 1)/(2x)\n\nSimilarly, y = b + √(1 + b²). Following the same steps, b = (y² - 1)/(2y). But since x y = 1, then y = 1/x. Therefore, substituting into the expression for b:\n\nb = ( (1/x)² - 1 ) / ( 2 * (1/x) ) = ( (1/x² - 1) ) / ( 2/x ) = ( (1 - x²)/x² ) / (2/x ) = (1 - x²)/x² * x/2 = (1 - x²)/(2x)\n\nSo, we have a = (x² - 1)/(2x) and b = (1 - x²)/(2x). Therefore, adding a and b:\n\na + b = [ (x² - 1) + (1 - x²) ] / (2x ) = (x² -1 +1 -x²)/ (2x ) = 0 / (2x ) = 0. Wait, so a + b = 0? That would mean (a + b)^2021 = 0^2021 = 0. But let me check this again because this seems too straightforward, and maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's verify the calculation step by step. Starting with x = a + √(1 + a²). Solving for a:\n\nx = a + √(1 + a²)\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n√(1 + a²) = x - a\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 + a² = x² - 2a x + a²\n\nCancel a²:\n\n1 = x² - 2a x\n\nThen:\n\n2a x = x² -1\n\nThus:\n\na = (x² -1)/(2x). Correct.\n\nSimilarly for y = b + √(1 + b²):\n\n√(1 + b²) = y - b\n\nSquare:\n\n1 + b² = y² - 2b y + b²\n\nCancel b²:\n\n1 = y² - 2b y\n\nThus:\n\n2b y = y² -1\n\nTherefore:\n\nb = (y² -1)/(2y). Correct.\n\nSince x y =1, substitute y =1/x into the expression for b:\n\nb = ( (1/x² -1 ) / (2*(1/x)) ) = ( (1 - x²)/x² ) / (2/x ) = (1 - x²)/x² * x/2 = (1 - x²)/(2x). Correct.\n\nTherefore, a + b = (x² -1)/(2x) + (1 - x²)/(2x) = [x² -1 +1 -x²]/(2x) = 0. So indeed, a + b =0. Therefore, (a + b)^2021 =0^2021 =0. \n\nBut the problem states that a and b are real numbers. Let me check if there are any restrictions. Since we have square roots, 1 + a² and 1 + b² must be non-negative, which they are since a² and b² are non-negative. So a and b can be any real numbers. However, when we derived a and b in terms of x and y, which are 1/cosh(θ) or something, but regardless, the algebra seems to hold.\n\nWait, but let me try plugging in some numbers to verify. Suppose a =0. Then the first term (0 + √1) =1. So the equation becomes 1*(b + √(1 + b²))=1, so b + √(1 + b²)=1. Let's solve for b. Let x = b + √(1 + b²). Then x=1. So √(1 + b²)=1 -b. Square both sides:1 + b²=1 -2b +b². Simplify: 1=1 -2b, so 0=-2b, so b=0. Therefore, a=0, b=0, then (a + b)^2021=0. So that works.\n\nAnother example: suppose a=1. Then the first term is 1 + √2 ≈ 2.414. Then the equation is (1 + √2)*(b + √(1 + b²))=1, so b + √(1 + b²)=1/(1 + √2). Let's compute 1/(1 + √2)=√2 -1 ≈0.414. So solve b + √(1 + b²)=√2 -1. Let me set x = b + √(1 + b²)=√2 -1. Then √(1 + b²)=√2 -1 -b. Square both sides:1 + b²= (√2 -1 -b)^2= (√2 -1)^2 - 2b(√2 -1) + b². Expand (√2 -1)^2=2 -2√2 +1=3 -2√2. So:\n\n1 + b²=3 -2√2 -2b(√2 -1) + b²\n\nCancel b²:\n\n1=3 -2√2 -2b(√2 -1)\n\nThen:\n\n-2=3 -2√2 -2b(√2 -1)\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Let me compute 3 -2√2 ≈3 -2.828≈0.172. So:\n\n-2=0.172 -2b(√2 -1)\n\nThen:\n\n-2 -0.172= -2b(√2 -1)\n\n-2.172= -2b(0.414)\n\nThen:\n\nb= (-2.172)/(-2*0.414)=2.172/(0.828)≈2.622\n\nBut this seems messy. Let me check if my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Wait, but if a=1, then according to the earlier formula, a=(x² -1)/(2x). Let x=1 + √2. Then x²=(1 + 2√2 +2)=3 +2√2. So a=(3 +2√2 -1)/(2*(1 +√2))=(2 +2√2)/(2 +2√2)=1. Correct. Then b=(1 -x²)/(2x). x²=3 +2√2, so 1 -x²= -2 -2√2. Then 2x=2*(1 +√2). So b=(-2 -2√2)/(2*(1 +√2))=(-1 -√2)/(1 +√2). Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 -1):\n\n(-1 -√2)(√2 -1)/[(1 +√2)(√2 -1)] = [ -√2 +1 -2 +√2 ] / (2 -1)= (-1)/1= -1. So b=-1. Then a=1, b=-1. Then a + b=0. So (a + b)^2021=0. Okay, that works. So even though I tried a=1 and got b=-1, which also gives a + b=0, so it's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let a be some number, then b is determined such that a + b=0, so their sum is zero. Therefore, regardless of the values of a and b satisfying the original equation, their sum is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.\n\nBut let me check another example where a and b are different. Suppose a=sinh(θ). Then x = a + √(1 + a²) = sinh(θ) + cosh(θ) = e^θ. Similarly, if y = e^{-θ}, then b = (y² -1)/(2y)= (e^{-2θ} -1)/(2e^{-θ})= (1 - e^{2θ})/(2e^{θ})= (1/e^{θ} - e^{θ})/2= - (e^{θ} - e^{-θ})/2= -sinh(θ). So a=sinh(θ), b=-sinh(θ), so a + b=0. Therefore, the same result. So regardless of how we parametrize, a + b=0. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of (a + b)^2021 is 0. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}So I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

Hmm, so the sequence depends on whether the index is even or odd. That makes me think of binary representations because even indices correspond to the lower bit (0) and odd indices correspond to the upper bit (1). Let me try to unfold the sequence step by step to see if there's a pattern.\n\nStarting with u_0 = 0.

If I look at the binary digits of n, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost), maybe the value of u_n is related to the number of ones in some way? Or perhaps the parity of the number of ones? Let's check:\n\nFor n=1 (1 in binary), number of ones is 1 (odd), u_1=1.\n\nn=2 (10), number of ones is 1 (odd), u_2=1.\n\nn=3 (11), number of ones is 2 (even), u_3=0.\n\nn=4 (100), number of ones is 1 (odd), u_4=1.\n\nn=5 (101), number of ones is 2 (even), u_5=0.\n\nn=6 (110), number of ones is 2 (even), u_6=0.\n\nn=7 (111), number of ones is 3 (odd), u_7=1.\n\nn=8 (1000), number of ones is 1 (odd), u_8=1.\n\nn=9 (1001), number of ones is 2 (even), u_9=0.\n\nn=10 (1010), number of ones is 2 (even), u_10=0.\n\nn=11 (1011), number of ones is 3 (odd), u_11=1.\n\nn=12 (1100), number of ones is 2 (even), u_12=0.\n\nn=13 (1101), number of ones is 3 (odd), u_13=1.\n\nn=14 (1110), number of ones is 3 (odd), u_14=1.\n\nn=15 (1111), number of ones is 4 (even), u_15=0.\n\nHmm, so the parity of the number of ones in the binary representation? Let's check:\n\nn=1 (1, ones=1, odd): u=1\n\nn=2 (10, ones=1, odd): u=1\n\nn=3 (11, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=4 (100, ones=1, odd): u=1\n\nn=5 (101, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=6 (110, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=7 (111, ones=3, odd): u=1\n\nn=8 (1000, ones=1, odd): u=1\n\nn=9 (1001, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=10 (1010, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=11 (1011, ones=3, odd): u=1\n\nn=12 (1100, ones=2, even): u=0\n\nn=13 (1101, ones=3, odd): u=1\n\nn=14 (1110, ones=3, odd): u=1\n\nn=15 (1111, ones=4, even): u=0\n\nYes! It seems like u_n is equal to 1 if the number of ones in the binary representation of n is odd, and 0 if it's even. Let's test this hypothesis further.\n\nTake n=16 (10000), which has 1 one. Number of ones is odd. u_16 should be 1.\n\nn=17 (10001), ones=2 (even), u_17=0.\n\nn=18 (10010), ones=2 (even), u_18=0.\n\nn=19 (10011), ones=3 (odd), u_19=1.\n\nSo the pattern holds. Therefore, the function u_n is equal to 1 if the number of 1s in the binary representation of n is odd, and 0 if it's even.\n\nNow, the problem asks for u_{2021}. Let's find the binary representation of 2021 and count the number of 1s.\n\nFirst, let's convert 2021 to binary.\n\n2021 divided by 2: 2021 /2 = 1010, remainder 1\n\n1010 /2 = 505, remainder 0\n\n505 /2 = 252, remainder 1\n\n252 /2 = 126, remainder 0\n\n126 /2 = 63, remainder 0\n\n63 /2 = 31, remainder 1\n\n31 /2 = 15, remainder 1\n\n15 /2 = 7, remainder 1\n\n7 /2 = 3, remainder 1\n\n3 /2 = 1, remainder 1\n\n1 /2 = 0, remainder 1\n\nSo writing the remainders from last to first: 11111100101.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nLet's compute 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10.\n\nWait, binary digits from right to left (LSB to MSB):\n\nThe remainders we got were:\n\n1 (from 2021), 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should do this step by step:\n\n2021 divided by 2:\n\n2021 ÷ 2 = 1010 with remainder 1 (LSB)\n\n1010 ÷ 2 = 505 rem 0\n\n505 ÷ 2 = 252 rem 1\n\n252 ÷ 2 = 126 rem 0\n\n126 ÷ 2 = 63 rem 0\n\n63 ÷ 2 = 31 rem 1\n\n31 ÷ 2 = 15 rem 1\n\n15 ÷ 2 = 7 rem 1\n\n7 ÷ 2 = 3 rem 1\n\n3 ÷ 2 = 1 rem 1\n\n1 ÷ 2 = 0 rem 1 (MSB)\n\nSo writing the remainders from MSB to LSB: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1.\n\nWait, let's count the digits:\n\nStarting from the first division:\n\n1 (MSB)\n\nThen the next remainders:\n\n1 (from 505), 0 (from 252), 0 (from 126), 1 (from 63), 1 (from 31), 1 (from 15), 1 (from 7), 1 (from 3), 0 (from 1), 1 (from 0). Wait, no, each division step gives a remainder. Let's list them all:\n\n2021 ÷2 =1010 rem1\n\n1010 ÷2=505 rem0\n\n505 ÷2=252 rem1\n\n252 ÷2=126 rem0\n\n126 ÷2=63 rem0\n\n63 ÷2=31 rem1\n\n31 ÷2=15 rem1\n\n15 ÷2=7 rem1\n\n7 ÷2=3 rem1\n\n3 ÷2=1 rem1\n\n1 ÷2=0 rem1\n\nSo the remainders are: 1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo writing them in order from MSB to LSB (left to right):\n\n1 (MSB), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 (LSB)\n\nWait, but wait, the first remainder is 1 (MSB), then next is 0, then 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 (LSB). So the binary representation is 1111111001.\n\nWait, let's count the digits:\n\nFrom the remainders list: 1 (MSB), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 (LSB). So 11 bits. So 1111111001.\n\nWait, let's verify:\n\nLet's compute 1111111001 in decimal.\n\nFrom the right (LSB):\n\nPositions:\n\n2^0: 1\n\n2^1: 0\n\n2^2: 0\n\n2^3: 1\n\n2^4: 0\n\n2^5: 1\n\n2^6: 1\n\n2^7: 1\n\n2^8: 1\n\n2^9: 1\n\n2^10: 1\n\nWait, actually, the positions are from right to left as 0 to 10.\n\nWait, the binary number 1111111001 is:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nPosition 10: 1\n\nPosition 9: 1\n\nPosition 8: 1\n\nPosition 7: 1\n\nPosition 6: 1\n\nPosition 5: 1\n\nPosition 4: 1\n\nPosition 3: 0\n\nPosition 2: 0\n\nPosition 1: 0\n\nPosition 0: 1\n\nWait, no, that can't be.

And I have to do this without using a calculator. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the sum S is from 1° to 89°, each term being the sixth power of the sine of those angles. Since sine has some symmetry, maybe there's a way to pair terms that are supplementary or complementary, which would add up to 180°, and maybe use that to simplify the sum. Let me recall that sin(180° - θ) = sinθ. Wait, but 180° is 90°*2, so 90°*2k would be 180°k. Maybe that's not directly helpful here. Wait, but 89° is 90° -1°, so maybe there's a relation here.\n\nWait, the angles go from 1° to 89°, so they're all less than 90°, so all sine values are positive. The sum S is the sum of their sixth powers. Let me consider if there's a formula for the sum of sin^6θ terms over a range of angles.\n\nI remember that there are formulas for sums of powers of sines, but I'm not sure about the sixth power specifically. Maybe I can use the multiple-angle identities or some complex exponentials? Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that sin^6θ can be expressed in terms of multiple angles, which might allow the sum to telescope or simplify.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a general formula for sin^nθ. For even n, like 6, there is a formula involving binomial expansion and cosines. Let me try to expand sin^6θ.\n\nUsing the identity sin^2θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2, so sin^6θ = (sin^2θ)^3 = [(1 - cos2θ)/2]^3. Expanding that:\n\n(1 - 3cos2θ + 3cos²2θ - cos³2θ)/8.\n\nHmm, but integrating or summing over k might be complicated here. Alternatively, maybe using complex exponentials. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the sum of sin^6θ from θ=0 to π/2, but here we have θ from 1° to 89°, so 89 terms. Wait, the formula for the sum of sin^6θ from θ=0 to π/2 is known. Maybe I can use that and adjust for the discrete sum instead of continuous.\n\nWait, but discrete sums can be approximated by integrals, but that's not exact. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of sin^6θ over n terms. Let me look up the formula for the sum of sin^6θ from k=1 to n.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to express sin^6θ in terms of multiple angles that can be summed up. Alternatively, using the identity for sin^6θ:\n\nsin^6θ = (sin²θ)^3 = [(1 - cos2θ)/2]^3.\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\n(1 - 3cos2θ + 3cos²2θ - cos³2θ)/8.\n\nThen, summing over θ from 1° to 89°, we can split the sum into several sums:\n\nSum = Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°} [1/8 - 3cos2θ/8 + 3cos²2θ/8 - cos³2θ/8].\n\nSo, Sum = (89/8) - (3/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos2θ + (3/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos²2θ - (1/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos³2θ.\n\nNow, let's compute each of these sums separately.\n\nFirst term: 89/8. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond term: -(3/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos2θ.\n\nThird term: +(3/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos²2θ.\n\nFourth term: -(1/8)Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos³2θ.\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these three sums, then I can combine them to find the total sum S.\n\nLet me start with the second sum: Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos2θ. Let's note that θ goes from 1° to 89°, so 2θ goes from 2° to 178°, in increments of 2°. So, that's 89 terms, from 2° to 178°, even angles. Wait, but 178° is 180° - 2°, so cos178°=cos(180°-2°)=-cos2°. So, the terms from 2° to 178° would have pairs that are negatives of each other. For example, cos2° + cos178° = cos2° - cos2° = 0. Similarly, cos4° + cos176° = cos4° - cos4° = 0, etc. How many such pairs are there?\n\nFrom 2° to 178°, there are 89 terms. Wait, 178° is 180° - 2°, so the angles are 2°, 4°, ..., 178°, which is 89 terms (since 178/2 = 89). So, 89 terms, which is an odd number. So, there will be 44 pairs (each consisting of two terms) and one unpaired term in the middle. Wait, but 89 terms: 89 divided by 2 is 44.5, so 44 pairs and 1 term left. The middle term would be the 45th term, which is at θ= (1 + 89)/2 = 45th term, so 2*45=90°, but 90° is excluded because θ goes up to 89°. Wait, no. Wait, θ ranges from 1° to 89°, so 2θ ranges from 2° to 178°, and the terms are at 2°, 4°, ..., 178°, which is 89 terms. So, when I pair them as cos2° + cos178°, cos4° + cos176°, etc., each pair sums to 0. How many pairs? Let's see: the first pair is 2° and 178°, then 4° and 176°, ..., up to 88° and 92°? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2θ=88°, so θ=44°, and 2θ=92°, θ=46°, up to 2θ=176°, θ=88°, and then 2θ=178°, θ=89°. Wait, but how are the pairs formed? Let's see:\n\nThe terms are at 2°, 4°, 6°, ..., 178°, which is 89 terms. So, when pairing 2θ with 180° - 2θ, but 180° - 2θ would be 180° - 2θ, which is equivalent to -2θ mod 360°, but since θ is up to 89°, 2θ is up to 178°, so 180° - 2θ is between -2° and 178° - 2*1°=176°, but in degrees, it's between 178° - 2*1°=178°-2°=176° down to 178°-2*89°=178°-178°=0°. Hmm, maybe this approach is not the best.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since cos(180° - x) = -cosx, so cos(178°) = cos(180° - 2°) = -cos2°, cos176° = cos(180° - 4°) = -cos4°, etc. So, for each pair (2θ, 180° - 2θ), the sum is cos2θ + cos(180° - 2θ) = cos2θ - cos2θ = 0. Wait, but 180° - 2θ would be 178° - 2θ? Wait, no. Wait, 180° - 2θ would be 180° minus 2θ. For example, if θ=1°, then 180° - 2θ=178°, so the pair is 2° and 178°, sum is cos2° + cos178°=cos2° - cos2°=0. Similarly, θ=2°, 180° - 4°=176°, so cos4° + cos176°=cos4° - cos4°=0. So, each pair sums to zero. How many such pairs are there?\n\nSince there are 89 terms, and each pair consists of two terms, except for the middle term if there's an odd number. 89 is odd, so there is one unpaired term. The middle term would be when θ=45°, which gives 2θ=90°, but θ=45° is not in our sum (since θ goes up to 89°). Wait, no. Wait, θ ranges from 1° to 89°, so 2θ ranges from 2° to 178°, and the middle term would be when θ=45°, which is 2θ=90°, but θ=45° is not included in our sum. Wait, but θ=45° is not part of the sum because the sum is up to 89°, so 2θ=90°, which is outside the sum. Wait, no, θ=45° would give 2θ=90°, but θ=45° is not included in the sum θ=1° to 89°, so 2θ=90° is not included. Wait, but θ=45° is not in the sum. Wait, θ ranges from 1° to 89°, so 2θ ranges from 2° to 178°, and 2θ=90° would correspond to θ=45°, which is not in the sum. Therefore, all pairs sum to zero, and the sum of cos2θ from θ=1° to 89° is zero. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if each pair sums to zero, and there are 44 pairs and one left term, which would be the unpaired term. But if the number of terms is 89, which is odd, then there is one term left. Wait, but how to determine which term is left? Wait, when θ ranges from 1° to 89°, 2θ ranges from 2° to 178°, which is 89 terms. So, 89 terms. If we pair them as (2°, 178°), (4°, 176°), ..., (88°, 92°), that's 44 pairs, and the last term would be 90°, but 90° is not included. Wait, θ=45° would give 2θ=90°, but θ=45° is not part of our sum. Wait, perhaps the pairs are (2°, 178°), (4°, 176°), ..., (88°, 92°), and the remaining terms are 2°, 4°, ..., 88°, and 90°, 92°, ..., 178°? Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me calculate the sum of cos2θ from θ=1° to 89°.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials. The sum S1 = Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}cos2θ. Let me write this as the real part of Sum_{θ=1°}^{89°}e^{i2θ}. Which is the real part of e^{i2°} * (1 - e^{i178°})/(1 - e^{i2°}).\n\nWait, the sum of a geometric series is Sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = (1 - r^n)/(1 - r). But here, θ goes from 1° to 89°, so 2θ goes from 2° to 178°, which is 89 terms. So, the sum is e^{i2°} + e^{i4°} + ... + e^{i178°} = Sum_{k=1}^{89} e^{i2°k} = e^{i2°} * (1 - e^{i178°})/(1 - e^{i2°}).\n\nSo, the real part of this sum is S1 = Re[e^{i2°} * (1 - e^{i178°})/(1 - e^{i2°})].\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 - e^{i2°} = -2i sin1° e^{i°}.\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step. Let me compute the numerator first: e^{i2°} * (1 - e^{i178°}).\n\nThe denominator is 1 - e^{i2°} = 1 - (cos2° + i sin2°) = -2i sin1° e^{i°}.\n\nSo, the sum is [e^{i2°} - e^{i180°}] / [1 - e^{i2°}] = [e^{i2°} - (-1)] / [1 - e^{i2°}] = [e^{i2°} + 1] / [1 - e^{i2°}].\n\nMultiply", "answer": "\\text{Observons que, pour tout } x \\text{ (ici les fonctions trigonométriques agissent sur des nombres exprimés en degrés) compris entre } 0 \\text{ et } 90 \\text{ on a } (\\sin x)^6 + (\\sin(90^\\circ - x))^6 = (\\sin x)^6 + (\\cos x)^6.\n\n\\text{On sait que } (\\sin x)^6 + (\\cos x)^6 = (\\sin x)^2 + (\\cos x)^2((\\sin x)^4 + (\\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x)^2(\\cos x)^2)\n\n\\text{Et comme le premier facteur de ce produit vaut } 1,\n\n\\text{il reste } (\\sin x)^6 + (\\cos x)^6 = ((\\sin x)^2 + (\\cos x)^2)^2 - 3(\\sin x)^2(\\cos x)^2 = 1 - \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin 2x)^2.\n\n\\text{La somme à évaluer comporte 44 termes du type que nous venons de récrire plus le terme } (\\sin 45^\\circ)^6\n\n\\text{On peut donc écrire : } S = 44 - \\frac{3}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{44}(\\sin 2n)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{353}{8} - \\frac{3}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{22} \\left( (\\sin 2n)^2 + (\\cos 2n)^2 \\right) \\dots \\text{ en réutilisant la technique précédente.}\n\n\\text{Finalement } S = \\frac{353}{8} - \\frac{3}{4} \\times 22 = \\frac{221}{8}\n"}

The first part asks me to show that the number of such numbers is given by the formula f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Then, part two is asking how many of these f(n) values from f(1) to f(2021) end with the digit 1.\n\nStarting with part 1. Hmm, let's think. So we need to count the number of n-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 5. Since each digit is a natural number (so from 0 to 9, but the first digit can't be 0, right?), we can model this as a stars and bars problem with some constraints.\n\nIn stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 5 is C(5 + n - 1, n - 1) = C(n + 4, 4). But here, we have the constraint that the first digit x1 must be at least 1 (since it's an n-digit number, first digit can't be 0). So maybe we can adjust the variables. Let me set y1 = x1 - 1, so that y1 >= 0, and then the equation becomes y1 + x2 + ... + xn = 4. The number of non-negative solutions here would be C(4 + n - 1, n - 1) = C(n + 3, 3) = (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)/6. Wait, but the formula given is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. For the first digit, which is x1, we have x1 >= 1 and sum x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 5. So if we subtract 1 from the first digit, then we have x1' = x1 - 1, so x1' >= 0, and the equation becomes x1' + x2 + ... + xn = 4. The number of solutions is C(4 + n - 1, n - 1) = C(n + 3, 3) = (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)/6. But the given formula is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, these don't match. Hmm. Maybe the problem is different? Wait, the problem says \"considère les entiers naturels non nuls avec exactement n chiffres\", which means numbers from 1 to 10^n - 1, so exactly n digits, not necessarily leading zeros. So, in that case, leading zeros would not be considered. So when we model it as x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 5, with each xi >= 0, but x1 >=1. Wait, but in the standard stars and bars, if we allow x1 >=0, then the number is C(n + 5 -1, 5) = C(n + 4, 5). But we need x1 >=1, so we subtract 1 from the total sum. Wait, maybe the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nWait, let's see. If we consider x1 + x2 + ... + xn =5, with each xi >=0, the number of solutions is C(n + 5 -1, 5) = C(n +4,5). But if we require x1 >=1, then set x1' = x1 -1, so x1' >=0, then the equation becomes x1' + x2 + ... + xn =4, so the number of solutions is C(n +4 -1, 4) = C(n +3,4) = (n +3)(n +2)(n +1)/6. But according to the problem, the formula is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, these are different. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"considère les entiers naturels non nuls avec exactement n chiffres\". So they are numbers with exactly n digits, each digit from 0 to 9, but the first digit from 1 to 9. Then, the sum of the digits is 5. So the standard stars and bars formula with x1 >=1 and others >=0, so the number is C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n +4,5) - C(n +4,4). Wait, maybe that's the inclusion-exclusion approach. Wait, but the formula given is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24, which is the same as C(n +3,4) multiplied by 4. Wait, C(n +3,4) is (n +3)(n +2)(n +1)/6, so multiplied by 4 would be (n +3)(n +2)(n +1)(4)/6 = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, that's the same as the given formula. Wait, so maybe the original formula is C(n +3,4) * 4? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the problem is to count the number of n-digit numbers (i.e., first digit from 1 to 9) where the digits sum to 5. So using stars and bars with x1 >=1 and others >=0. So the number is C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n +4,5) - C(n +4,4). Wait, but that gives C(n+4,5) - C(n+4,4) = [C(n+4,5) - C(n+4,4)] = [ (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/120 ) - (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/6 ) ] = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)[ (n+1)/120 - 2/120 ) ] = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n -1)/120. Hmm, but this doesn't match the given formula. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"On considère les entiers naturels non nuls avec exactement n chiffres. On note f(n) le nombre de tels entiers dont la somme de tous les chiffres vaut 5.\" So they are numbers with exactly n digits, i.e., first digit from 1 to 9, others from 0 to 9, and the sum of digits is 5. So the number of such numbers is equivalent to the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn =5 where x1 >=1 and others >=0. So that's equivalent to the number of non-negative solutions to x1' + x2 + ... + xn =4 (where x1' =x1 -1). So the number of solutions is C(n +4 -1,4) = C(n +3,4) = (n +3)(n +2)(n +1)/6. But the given formula is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, but that's the same as C(n+3,4) *4? Wait, no. Wait, (n +3)(n +2)(n +1)/6 is equal to (n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/6. The given formula is (n+3)(n+2)(n+1)n /24. Wait, that's not the same. Wait, unless there's a miscalculation here. Wait, maybe the problem is actually allowing leading zeros, but the user stated \"considère les entiers naturels non nuls avec exactement n chiffres\", so leading zeros are not allowed. Therefore, the number of solutions should be C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n +4,5) - C(n +4,4) = [C(n +4,5) - C(n +4,4)] = [ (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/120 ) - (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/6 ) ] = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)[ (n+1)/120 - 2/120 ) ] = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n -1)/120. Hmm, but this is different from the given formula. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the problem is allowing leading zeros, but the user stated \"non nuls\", so leading zeros are not allowed. Therefore, the number of such numbers is C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n+4,5) - C(n+4,4) = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/120 - (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/6. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst term: (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/120\n\nSecond term: (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/6 = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)*20/120\n\nSo the difference is [ (n+1) - 20 ] * (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/120 = (n -19)(n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/120\n\nHmm, which isn't the same as the given formula. So there must be a mistake here. Wait, but the problem states that f(n) is given by n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not allowing leading zeros, but the formula is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check for specific n. Let's take n=1. Then the numbers are 1 to 9, sum of digits is 5. So how many numbers? 5. According to the formula n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24, when n=1, that's 1*2*3*4/24 = 24/24=1. Which is incorrect, since there are 5 numbers. So the formula is wrong. Wait, but the problem says f(n) is equal to that formula. So that can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"considère les entiers naturels non nuls avec exactement n chiffres\". So that's numbers with exactly n digits, but leading zeros are allowed? Wait, no, because natural numbers don't have leading zeros. So for example, a 3-digit number can't start with 0. So in that case, the formula I derived earlier, C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n+4,5) - C(n+4,4), which is (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)/120 - (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)/6 = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)[ (n+1)/120 - 2/120 ] = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n-1)/120. But the problem states f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. So for n=1, that gives 1*2*3*4/24 = 24/24=1, but there are 5 numbers. So clearly, that's not matching. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when we model the digits as x1 + x2 + ... + xn =5, with each xi >=0, but allowing leading zeros. But the problem states \"non nuls\", so leading zeros are not allowed. Wait, but then the number of solutions would be C(n +5 -1,5) = C(n+4,5). For n=1, that's C(5,5)=1, which is wrong because there are 5 numbers. So this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when we allow leading zeros, the number of solutions is C(n +5 -1,5) = C(n+4,5). But since leading zeros are not allowed, the first digit must be at least 1. So the equation is x1 + x2 + ... + xn =5, with x1 >=1 and others >=0. Then the number of solutions is C(n +5 -1,5) - C(n +5 -1,5 -1) = C(n+4,5) - C(n+4,4). Which is similar to what I did earlier. But for n=1, this gives 1 - 1 = 0, which is incorrect. Wait, but that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula given in the problem is incorrect, but the user says to prove that f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/24. So maybe there's a different approach. Wait, let me check the problem again. Oh wait, maybe the problem is considering numbers with exactly n digits, but leading zeros are allowed. Wait, but natural numbers don't have leading zeros, so that can't be. So the formula must be derived differently.\n\nWait, let's consider another approach. Let's think of the number as a sequence of n digits, each from 0 to 9, but the first digit from 1 to 9, and the sum of the digits is 5. So the number of such numbers is equal to the number of compositions of 5 into n parts, where part 1 is at least 1 and the others are non-negative. Wait, but compositions usually allow parts to be any non-negative integers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as the number of sequences of n digits where the sum is 5, and the first digit is at least 1. So, the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn =5, with x1 >=1 and xi >=0 for i >=2. Let’s substitute y1 = x1 -1, so y1", "answer": "2.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tetrahedron has edges AB, AC, AD that are pairwise orthogonal. That means AB is perpendicular to both AC and AD, right? So, if I imagine this tetrahedron, vertex A is connected to B, C, D, and the edges AB, AC, AD form a sort of 3D right angle. That must mean that the coordinate system can be set up with A at the origin, and vectors AB, AC, AD as the axes. So, maybe assigning coordinates to points B, C, D as (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c) respectively. Then, AB would be length a, AC length b, AD length c. But the problem states AB = 3, so a = 3. CD is given as √2. Let me check what CD would be in this coordinate system.\n\nPoint C is (0,b,0) and D is (0,0,c). So, the distance between C and D is √[(0)^2 + (-b)^2 + (c)^2] = √(b² + c²). So, CD = √(b² + c²) = √2. Therefore, b² + c² = 2. So, we have AB = 3, CD = √2, and b² + c² = 2.\n\nSo, the variables here are a = 3, and b and c such that b² + c² = 2. The edges we need to compute are BC, BD, AC, AD. Let's note that AC is length b, AD is length c, AB is 3, and BD is the distance between B (3,0,0) and D (0,0,c). So BD would be √[(3)^2 + (0)^2 + (c)^2] = √(9 + c²). Similarly, BC is the distance between B (3,0,0) and C (0,b,0), which is √[(3)^2 + (b)^2 + (0)^2] = √(9 + b²). Similarly, AD is c, which is already given.\n\nSo, let's write down all the terms:\n\nBC⁶ = (√(9 + b²))⁶ = (9 + b²)^3\n\nBD⁶ = (√(9 + c²))⁶ = (9 + c²)^3\n\nAC⁶ = b⁶\n\nAD⁶ = c⁶\n\nSo, the expression we need to minimize is BC⁶ + BD⁶ − AC⁶ − AD⁶ = (9 + b²)^3 + (9 + c²)^3 − b⁶ − c⁶.\n\nGiven that b² + c² = 2. So, we can express c² as 2 - b², so c = √(2 - b²). But since b and c are positive (they are lengths), we can consider 0 < b < √2 and 0 < c < √2. However, since b² + c² = 2, both b and c must be between 0 and √2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(b) = (9 + b²)^3 + (9 + (2 - b²))^3 − b⁶ − (2 - b²)^3.\n\nLet me simplify this expression:\n\nFirst, note that c² = 2 - b², so:\n\nBD⁶ = (9 + (2 - b²))^3 = (11 - b²)^3\n\nSimilarly, AC⁶ = b⁶, AD⁶ = (2 - b²)^3\n\nTherefore, f(b) = (9 + b²)^3 + (11 - b²)^3 - b⁶ - (2 - b²)^3\n\nNow, we need to find the value of b in (0, √2) that minimizes f(b).\n\nLet me compute f(b):\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\n(9 + b²)^3 = 9³ + 3*9²*b² + 3*9*(b²)^2 + (b²)^3 = 729 + 243b² + 27b⁴ + b⁶\n\n(11 - b²)^3 = 11³ - 3*11²*b² + 3*11*(b²)^2 - (b²)^3 = 1331 - 363b² + 33b⁴ - b⁶\n\nSimilarly, (2 - b²)^3 = 8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nf(b) = [729 + 243b² + 27b⁴ + b⁶] + [1331 - 363b² + 33b⁴ - b⁶] - [b⁶] - [8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶]\n\nLet's compute term by term:\n\nFirst, combine the terms from (9 + b²)^3 and (11 - b²)^3:\n\n729 + 1331 = 2060\n\n243b² - 363b² = -120b²\n\n27b⁴ + 33b⁴ = 60b⁴\n\nb⁶ - b⁶ = 0\n\nThen subtract [b⁶ + 8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶]:\n\nBut wait, the terms being subtracted are [b⁶ + (8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶)] = 8 - 12b² + 6b⁴\n\nTherefore, combining all together:\n\nf(b) = 2060 - 120b² + 60b⁴ - 8 + 12b² - 6b⁴\n\nSimplify:\n\n2060 - 8 = 2052\n\n-120b² + 12b² = -108b²\n\n60b⁴ - 6b⁴ = 54b⁴\n\nSo, f(b) = 54b⁴ - 108b² + 2052\n\nFactor out 54:\n\nf(b) = 54(b⁴ - 2b² + (2052/54))\n\nSimplify 2052/54: 2052 ÷ 6 = 342; 342 ÷ 9 = 38. So 2052/54 = 342/9 = 38. Wait, 54*38 = 2052. Yes. So, 2052/54 = 38. Therefore:\n\nf(b) = 54(b⁴ - 2b² + 38)\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Wait, 54*(b⁴ - 2b² + 38). Let me check the calculation again.\n\nOriginal expression after combining terms:\n\n2060 - 8 = 2052\n\n-120b² + 12b² = -108b²\n\n60b⁴ - 6b⁴ = 54b⁴\n\nSo, 2052 - 108b² + 54b⁴\n\nSo, factor 54: 54*(b⁴ - 2b² + (2052/54)).\n\nBut 2052 divided by 54:\n\n54*38 = 54*30 + 54*8 = 1620 + 432 = 2052. So, 2052/54 = 38. Therefore, f(b) = 54*(b⁴ - 2b² + 38). Wait, but 2052 - 108b² + 54b⁴ = 54b⁴ - 108b² + 2052 = 54(b⁴ - 2b² + 38). Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but 54*(b⁴ - 2b² + 38). So, f(b) = 54*(b⁴ - 2b² + 38). Then, to find the minimum of f(b), we can instead minimize the expression inside the parentheses, since 54 is a positive constant multiplier.\n\nSo, let's focus on minimizing g(b) = b⁴ - 2b² + 38, where b is in (0, √2).\n\nTo find the minimum of g(b), take derivative:\n\ng'(b) = 4b³ - 4b.\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n4b³ - 4b = 0 => 4b(b² - 1) = 0\n\nSolutions are b = 0 or b = ±1. But since b > 0 and in (0, √2), the critical points are at b = 1.\n\nTherefore, the critical point is at b = 1. Check if this is a minimum.\n\nSecond derivative test:\n\ng''(b) = 12b² - 4\n\nAt b = 1, g''(1) = 12(1) - 4 = 8 > 0, so it's a local minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of g(b) is at b = 1:\n\ng(1) = 1^4 - 2*1^2 + 38 = 1 - 2 + 38 = 37\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(b) is 54*37 = 54*30 + 54*7 = 1620 + 378 = 1998\n\nWait, so f(b) is minimized at b = 1, giving 1998. Is that the answer? Let me verify the calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, but let's recap:\n\nWe started with f(b) = (9 + b²)^3 + (11 - b²)^3 - b⁶ - (2 - b²)^3\n\nThen expanded each term:\n\n(9 + b²)^3 = 729 + 243b² + 27b⁴ + b⁶\n\n(11 - b²)^3 = 1331 - 363b² + 33b⁴ - b⁶\n\n(2 - b²)^3 = 8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶\n\nSubtracting these: \n\nFirst, add all positive terms:\n\n729 + 1331 + 8 = 2060\n\nThen 243b² - 363b² -12b² = 243 - 363 -12 = -120b²\n\n27b⁴ + 33b⁴ +6b⁴ = 66b⁴\n\nThen subtract the b⁶ terms: 1*b⁶ - (-b⁶) = 1*b⁶ + b⁶ = 2b⁶? Wait, no. Wait, the expression is:\n\n[729 + 243b² + 27b⁴ + b⁶] + [1331 - 363b² + 33b⁴ - b⁶] - [b⁶ + 8 -12b² +6b⁴ -b⁶]\n\nSo, the terms being subtracted are:\n\nb⁶ (from the first cube) + 8 (from the second cube) -12b² (from the second cube) +6b⁴ -b⁶ (from the third cube)\n\nWait, but actually, the third cube is (2 - b²)^3 = 8 - 12b² + 6b⁴ - b⁶. So, subtracting that would be subtracting 8, adding 12b², subtracting 6b⁴, and adding b⁶. But also, in the original expression, we have subtracting the entire (2 - b²)^3, which is 8 -12b² +6b⁴ -b⁶. So, the subtraction is:\n\n- (8 -12b² +6b⁴ -b⁶) = -8 +12b² -6b⁴ +b⁶\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\nOriginal positive terms:\n\n729 + 1331 +8 = 2060\n\nNegative terms:\n\n-363b² +243b² = -120b²\n\nNegative terms from the middle cube:\n\n-12b²\n\nNegative terms from the third cube:\n\n-6b⁴\n\nNegative terms from the third cube:\n\n- (-b⁶) = +b⁶\n\nSo, combining all:\n\n2060 -120b² -12b² +66b⁴ +b⁶ -6b⁴ -b⁶\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, expanding:\n\nFrom the first cube: 729 +243b² +27b⁴ +b⁶\n\nFrom the second cube: 1331 -363b² +33b⁴ -b⁶\n\nFrom the third cube: -8 +12b² -6b⁴ +b⁶\n\nSo, sum all these:\n\n729 +1331 -8 + (243b² -363b² +12b²) + (27b⁴ +33b⁴ -6b⁴) + (b⁶ -b⁶ +b⁶)\n\nCompute each group:\n\nConstant terms: 729 +1331 -8 = 729 +1331 = 2060; 2060 -8 = 2052\n\nb² terms: 243b² -363b² +12b² = (243 -363 +12)b² = (-108)b²\n\nb⁴ terms:27b⁴ +33b⁴ -6b⁴ = (60)b⁴\n\nb⁶ terms:", "answer": "S = BC^6 + BD^6 - AC^6 - AD^6 = (BC^2 - AC^2)(BC^4 + BC^2 AC^2 + AC^4) + (BD^2 - AD^2)(BD^4 + BD^2 AD^2 + AD^4)\n\n\\text{On se place dans les triangles } ABC, ABD, ACD, \\text{ rectangles en } A \\text{ pour ne faire apparaître dans la somme } S \\text{ que des longueurs d’arêtes issues de } A :\n\nS = AB^2[(AB^2 + AC^2)^2 + (AB^2 + AC^2)AC^2 + AC^4 + (AB^2 + AD^2)^2 + (AB^2 + AD^2)AD^2 + AD^4]\n\n\\text{On peut encore écrire :}\n\nS = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3AC^4 + 3AD^4 + 3AB^2AC^2 + 3AB^2AD^2]\n\n\\text{On peut encore écrire } AC^4 + AD^4 = (AC^2 + AD^2)^2 - 2AC^2 AD^2 = CD^4 - 2AC^2 AD^2 \\text{ car } AC^2 + AD^2 = CD^2\n\n\\text{Si on écrit } S = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3CD^4 - 6AC^2 AD^2 + 3AB^2CD^2],\n\n\\text{on obtient } S = AB^2[2AB^4 + 3CD^4 + 6AC^2(AC^2 - CD^2) + 3AB^2CD^2]\n\n\\text{et on voit que } S \\text{ est une fonction de } AC, \\text{ puisque } AB \\text{ et } CD \\text{ sont donnés.}\n\n\\text{La fonction définie par } f(x) = x(x - CD^2) \\text{ atteint son minimum en } \\frac{CD^2}{2}, \\text{ et ce minimum est } -\\frac{CD^4}{4}\n\n\\text{Le minimum de } S \\text{ est donc } AB^2 \\left[ 2AB^4 + 3CD^4 - 6 \\frac{CD^4}{4} + 3AB^2CD^2 \\right] = 1\\ 998\n"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a sequence to be convergent. A sequence is convergent if it approaches a finite limit as n goes to infinity. So, I need to check if there exists some limit L such that as n becomes very large, u_n gets closer and closer to L.\n\nFirst, let's try to see if the sequence is increasing or decreasing. Maybe that can help. Let's compute the first few terms to get an idea. But since u₀ is positive, let's pick an example. Suppose u₀ = 1. Then u₁ = sqrt(1) + 1/1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Then u₂ = sqrt(2) + 1/2 ≈ 1.4142 + 0.5 = 1.9142. Then u₃ ≈ sqrt(1.9142) + 1/3 ≈ 1.383 + 0.333 ≈ 1.716. u₄ ≈ sqrt(1.716) + 1/4 ≈ 1.309 + 0.25 ≈ 1.559. Hmm, it seems like the sequence is decreasing after u₀. Wait, but starting from u₀ = 1, it went 1, 2, 1.9142, 1.716, 1.559... so maybe it's decreasing? But u₁ was already 2, which is larger than u₀. So maybe after u₀, it's decreasing? Let me check another starting point. Suppose u₀ = 0.25. Then u₁ = sqrt(0.25) + 1/1 = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5. Then u₂ = sqrt(1.5) + 1/2 ≈ 1.2247 + 0.5 = 1.7247. Then u₃ ≈ sqrt(1.7247) + 1/3 ≈ 1.313 + 0.333 ≈ 1.646. u₄ ≈ sqrt(1.646) + 1/4 ≈ 1.283 + 0.25 ≈ 1.533. So again, seems like it's decreasing. Maybe after u₀, the sequence is decreasing? But starting from u₀ = 0.25, even though u₁ is larger, the next terms decrease. So maybe the sequence is eventually decreasing and bounded below, hence convergent? But how do I know if it's bounded below?\n\nWait, if it's eventually decreasing and bounded below, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it would converge. But first, I need to check if the sequence is bounded below. Since all terms are positive, maybe the lower bound is 0? But can we prove that the sequence is bounded below?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Monotone Convergence Theorem directly. If we can show that the sequence is decreasing and bounded below, then it converges. But how do we know it's decreasing?\n\nLet me check the general case. Suppose u_n is positive. Then u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n) + 1/(n+1). To see if the sequence is decreasing, we need to check if u_{n+1} ≤ u_n for all n. That is, sqrt(u_n) + 1/(n+1) ≤ u_n. Let's rearrange that inequality:\n\nsqrt(u_n) ≤ u_n - 1/(n+1)\n\nIs this true for all n? For u_n to satisfy this inequality, we need that u_n - sqrt(u_n) ≥ 1/(n+1). Hmm, let's see. For small u_n, sqrt(u_n) is much smaller than u_n, so u_n - sqrt(u_n) ≈ u_n, which is certainly greater than 1/(n+1) for large n. But for small u_n, maybe not. Wait, but u_n is positive, so even if u_n is very small, 1/(n+1) is decreasing to 0. So maybe for large n, this inequality holds, but for small u_n, maybe not. So perhaps the sequence is decreasing only eventually?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that the sequence is decreasing for all n ≥ 1. Let's test with the first few terms. For n=1: u₁ = sqrt(u₀) + 1/1. If u₀ is small, like u₀ = 0.25, then u₁ = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5. So u₁ > u₀. Then u₂ = sqrt(1.5) + 1/2 ≈ 1.2247 + 0.5 = 1.7247, which is less than u₁. Similarly, u₃ ≈ 1.646, which is less than u₂. So even though u₁ > u₀, subsequent terms decrease. So maybe the sequence is decreasing after a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that for n ≥ N, u_{n+1} ≤ u_n. Let's suppose that for some n, u_n ≤ u_{n-1} + 1/n. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's compute the difference u_n - u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n) - 1/(n+1). For the sequence to be decreasing, we need this difference to be positive. So u_n - u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n) - 1/(n+1) > 0. So sqrt(u_n) > 1/(n+1). If u_n is sufficiently large, then sqrt(u_n) would be larger than 1/(n+1). But if u_n is small, then 1/(n+1) is larger. So maybe there's a point where sqrt(u_n) > 1/(n+1), and then the difference becomes positive. Let's see.\n\nSuppose u_n is such that sqrt(u_n) > 1/(n+1). Then u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n) + 1/(n+1) < sqrt(u_n) + sqrt(u_n) = 2 sqrt(u_n). But if sqrt(u_n) > 1/(n+1), then 2 sqrt(u_n) > 2/(n+1). Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe we can bound u_n from below. Since u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n) + 1/(n+1). If we can find a lower bound for u_n, say u_n ≥ c for some constant c, then the sequence is bounded below by c. But to ensure that u_n ≥ c for all n, we need to show that sqrt(u_n) + 1/(n+1) ≥ c. If we can choose c such that 1/(n+1) ≥ c - sqrt(c), then perhaps. Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to consider the limit. Suppose the sequence converges to L. Then, taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation:\n\nL = sqrt(L) + lim_{n→∞} 1/(n+1)\n\nBut lim_{n→∞} 1/(n+1) = 0. Therefore, L = sqrt(L). So, solving L = sqrt(L), we get L = 0 or L = 1. Since u₀ is positive, and the terms are increasing (from the examples), but if the limit L must satisfy L = sqrt(L), then L is either 0 or 1. But if the sequence is increasing, then the limit would have to be 1. However, in our examples, starting from u₀ = 1, the sequence was decreasing after some terms, so maybe it converges to 0? But that contradicts. Wait, in the example where u₀ = 1, u₁ = 2, which is larger than u₀. Then u₂ ≈ 1.914, which is less than u₁. So the sequence went up then down. So maybe it oscillates? Wait, but in the examples I tried, starting from any positive u₀, the sequence seems to be decreasing after the first term. Let me check with u₀ = 1. Let me compute more terms:\n\nu₀ = 1\n\nu₁ = sqrt(1) + 1/1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nu₂ = sqrt(2) + 1/2 ≈ 1.4142 + 0.5 = 1.9142\n\nu₃ ≈ sqrt(1.9142) ≈ 1.383, so u₃ ≈ 1.383 + 1/3 ≈ 1.636\n\nu₄ ≈ sqrt(1.636) ≈ 1.279, so u₄ ≈ 1.279 + 1/4 ≈ 1.534\n\nu₅ ≈ sqrt(1.534) ≈ 1.238, so u₅ ≈ 1.238 + 1/5 ≈ 1.438\n\nu₆ ≈ sqrt(1.438) ≈ 1.199, so u₆ ≈ 1.199 + 1/6 ≈ 1.199 + 0.1667 ≈ 1.3657\n\nu₇ ≈ sqrt(1.3657) ≈ 1.168, so u₇ ≈ 1.168 + 1/7 ≈ 1.168 + 0.1429 ≈ 1.3109\n\nu₈ ≈ sqrt(1.3109) ≈ 1.145, so u₈ ≈ 1.145 + 1/8 ≈ 1.145 + 0.125 ≈ 1.27\n\nu₉ ≈ sqrt(1.27) ≈ 1.127, so u₉ ≈ 1.127 + 1/9 ≈ 1.127 + 0.1111 ≈ 1.2381\n\nu₁₀ ≈ sqrt(1.2381) ≈ 1.113, so u₁₀ ≈ 1.113 + 1/10 ≈ 1.113 + 0.1 ≈ 1.213\n\nHmm, so the sequence seems to be decreasing from u₁ onwards. Wait, but when I started with u₀ = 1, the first term is u₁ = 2, then u₂ ≈ 1.914, then u₃ ≈ 1.636, etc. So it's decreasing. So in this case, maybe the sequence is decreasing for all n ≥ 1, starting from u₁. So perhaps the sequence is eventually decreasing. But how do we know it's not decreasing from n=0? For n=0, u₁ = 2, which is larger than u₀=1. So the sequence increases at the first step, then decreases thereafter. So maybe it's decreasing for n ≥ 1.\n\nIf that's the case, then once the sequence is decreasing, if it's bounded below, it will converge. So we need to check if it's bounded below. Let's see. Since all terms are positive, and we've seen that after n=1, the terms are decreasing. But does the sequence ever go below 1? Let's check. In the example where u₀ = 1, the sequence remains above 1. Let's try u₀ = 0.5. Then u₁ = sqrt(0.5) + 1 = ~0.707 + 1 = 1.707. Then u₂ ≈ sqrt(1.707) ≈ 1.306 + 1/2 = 1.806. Then u₃ ≈ sqrt(1.806) ≈ 1.344 + 1/3 ≈ 1.478. u₄ ≈ sqrt(1.478) ≈ 1.216 + 1/4 ≈ 1.366. Then u₅ ≈ sqrt(1.366) ≈ 1.169 + 1/5 = 1.269. u₆ ≈ sqrt(1.269) ≈ 1.127 + 1/6 ≈ 1.203. u₇ ≈ sqrt(1.203) ≈ 1.097 + 1/7 ≈ 1.141. u₈ ≈ sqrt(1.141) ≈ 1.068 + 1/8 = 1.145. u₉ ≈ sqrt(1.145) ≈ 1.069 + 1/9 ≈ 1.169. u₁₀ ≈ sqrt(1.169) ≈ 1.081 + 1/10 = 1.181. So here, even starting from u₀ = 0.5, the sequence seems to be decreasing after some point. Wait, but even after u₁ = 1.707, which is higher than u₀ = 0.5, then it starts decreasing. So maybe the sequence is decreasing for all n ≥ 1, and bounded below by 0.25? Wait, in the first example, starting from u₀ = 1, the terms are 1, 2, 1.914, 1.716, etc., which approach around 1.5 or so. Wait, but in the second example, starting from u₀ = 0.5, the terms go up to around 1.707, then decrease. So maybe the sequence is bounded below by 0.5? Wait, in the second example, starting from u₀ = 0.5, u₁ = ~1.707, which is above 0.5, then u₂ = ~1.806, which is above 0.5. Wait, but 0.5 is the initial term. Wait, the sequence is defined for n ≥ 0, so u₀ is the first term. Wait, but the problem says \"the sequence is convergent\". So maybe u₀ is the", "answer": "u_1 = \\sqrt{u_0} + 1 ; \\text{ à partir de ce terme, par récurrence, tous les termes de la suite sont bien définis et positifs.}\n\\text{Remarquons que SI cette suite admet une limite } \\ell , \\text{ cette limite ne peut être que 1, car tous les termes sont supérieurs à 1 et l’égalité } \\ell = \\sqrt{\\ell} \\text{ conduit à } \\ell = 0 \\text{ ou } \\ell = 1.\n\n\\text{Peut-on déterminer un sens de variation ?}\n\n\\text{Calculons pour } n \\text{ quelconque : } u_{n+1} - u_n = \\sqrt{u_n} - \\sqrt{u_{n-1}} - \\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\n\n\\text{S’il existe un rang } n \\text{ tel que } \\sqrt{u_n} - \\sqrt{u_{n-1}} < 0, \\text{ les différences suivantes le sont aussi et la suite est décroissante à partir du premier rang où cette occurrence se produit.

Si je tire \\( (11, 7, 2, 2) \\), ai-je intérêt à tout relancer, garder le 11 ou garder les deux 2 ? Que dois-je faire ?", "response": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle these probability problems one by one. They seem a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nStarting with problem 1: What's the probability that I don't mark anything. Hmm. So, the rule is that if any face appears two or more times, we mark the number of points on that face. If all four faces are distinct, we don't mark anything. So, to not mark anything, all four numbers must be distinct. Each die has numbers from 1 to 20, and we have four dice, so all numbers must be unique.\n\nFirst, let's think about the sample space. Each die has 20 numbers, and there are four dice. Since the dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 20^4. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the event we want is that all four numbers are distinct. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose four distinct numbers from 20 and assign them to the four dice. For the first die, there are 20 choices. The second die has to be different, so 19 choices. The third die 18, and the fourth die 17. So, 20 * 19 * 18 * 17. Therefore, the probability is (20*19*18*17)/(20^4). Let me compute that. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to think about it. The probability that the first die is any number is 1. The second die must be different from the first, so 19/20. The third die 18/20, and the fourth die 17/20. So the probability is (19/20) * (18/20) * (17/20). That seems simpler. Let me check both methods. Yes, both should give the same result. \n\nCalculating that: (19*18*17)/(20^3). Let me compute numerator: 19*18=342, 342*17=5814. Denominator: 20^3=8000. So 5814/8000. That reduces to, let's see, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2907/4000. Which is 0.72675. So approximately 72.68% chance of not marking anything. But maybe leave it as a fraction since the question might prefer exact terms. So 5814/8000 simplifies to 2907/4000. Wait, 2907 and 4000, do they have any common factors? Let's check. 2907 divided by 3 is 969, so 3*969=2907. 4000 divided by 3 is not integer. 2907 divided by 5 is 581.4, so no. So 2907/4000 is the simplified form. Alternatively, 5814/8000 is also the same. Either way, that's the probability.\n\nMoving on to problem 2: The probability of getting exactly 8 points. So this happens when at least two of the four dice show the same number, and the sum of the numbers on the faces is 8. Wait, but how can you have a sum of 8 with four numbers, each from 1 to 20? Wait, but the example given has (5,5,10,20) summing to 5+5+10+20=40, which is not 8. Wait, but maybe the question is that when you have two or more dice with the same number, you sum those numbers. But in the problem statement, it says \"the same face appears two or more times, mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, for example, two 5s would mark 5 points. So, the total points are the sum of the numbers on the faces that are repeated. Wait, but in the example given, (2,16,5,10) gives 0 points because all are distinct. The example (5,5,10,20) gives 5 points because there are two 5s, so sum is 5. Wait, but the sum is 5, which is the number of points. Wait, but that conflicts with the problem statement. Wait, the problem statement says \"mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, if you have two or more faces showing the same number, you mark that number. But in the example (5,5,10,20), the two 5s sum to 5, but the problem says \"mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So perhaps, when you have two or more faces showing the same number, you sum the numbers on those faces and mark that sum instead of the number. Wait, that would make the example (5,5,10,20) sum to 5+5=10, so mark 10 points, but the example says 5. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"the same face appears two or more times, mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, if two or more faces show the same number, you mark that number. So, in the example (5,5,10,20), the two 5s are marked as 5 each? Wait, but the problem says \"mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, maybe if two or more faces show the same number, you mark each occurrence as that number? But the example given is (5,5,10,20) which sums to 5, but the problem says \"mark 5 points\". Wait, maybe the sum of the numbers is the points. Wait, but the problem says \"mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, maybe it's the sum of the numbers on the faces that are repeated. Wait, the example is (5,5,10,20). If you have two 5s, then you sum them to 10, and mark 10 points. But the example says it's 5 points. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the problem is that when two or more faces show the same number, you mark that number (each occurrence) and sum them. But the example given might be illustrative, not a precise reflection of the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the same face appears two or more times, mark the number of points indicated on this face.\" So, if two or more faces have the same number, you mark that number, but if there are multiple instances (two or more), does that mean you sum them? For example, two 5s would sum to 10, so mark 10 points. But the example given is (5,5,10,20) which sums to 5, but the example says \"mark 5 points\". Wait, this is a contradiction. Wait, the example given in the problem is (5,5,10,20) which is 5+5+10+20=40, but the problem says \"mark 5 points\". That's not matching. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement is that when you have two or more faces showing the same number, you mark that number (each occurrence) and sum them. For example, two 5s would sum to 10, so mark 10 points. But the problem example given is (5,5,10,20), which would sum to 5+5=10, but the problem says \"mark 5 points\". Wait, this is confusing.

So, in the example (5,5,10,20), the sum is 5+5+10+20=40, but the problem says \"mark 5 points\". That's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you have two or more faces showing the same number, you mark that number once, but the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the sum is the number of points, but that's not how it's written. Wait, the exact problem statement is:\n\n\"the same face appears two or more times, mark the number of points indicated on this face.\"\n\nSo, if there are two or more faces showing the same number, mark the number of points indicated on this face, meaning each instance is marked as that number. So, for example, two 5s would mark 5 each? But that would be 10 points. However, the example given is (5,5,10,20) which is marked 5 points. That suggests that perhaps the problem is that when you have two or more faces showing the same number, you sum the numbers of those faces.

Wait, the example given in the problem is (5,5,10,20) and it's written as \"mark 5 points\", but according to the problem statement, that would mean that the two 5s are each marked as 5, summing to 10.

This is contradictory. Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you have two or more faces showing the same number, you mark the number of points indicated on that face.

Let me start by writing down the equations to make sure I have them right.\n\nThe first fraction is (p² + 2q)/(q + r) and it has to be an integer. Similarly, the second is (q² + 9r)/(r + p), and the third is (r² + 3p)/(p + q). All three of these need to result in whole numbers. Since p, q, r are primes, they can only be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Maybe starting with small primes will help, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Let's think through each equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first equation: (p² + 2q) must be divisible by (q + r). So, (p² + 2q) mod (q + r) should be 0. Similarly for the other two fractions. Maybe I can express each numerator in terms of the denominator. Let me try to manipulate the first fraction.\n\nLet me denote A = p² + 2q, B = q + r, and C = r² + 3p. So, A/B is an integer. Therefore, A = kB for some integer k. So, p² + 2q = k(q + r). Similarly, for the second equation, B = q + r, and C = r² + 3p = m(r + p) for some integer m. And the third equation, C = r² + 3p = n(p + q) for some integer n.\n\nHmm, so maybe these denominators (q + r), (r + p), and (p + q) are factors of the numerators. Since p, q, r are primes, their sum q + r is at least 2 + 3 = 5. So, k, m, n are positive integers. Let's see if we can bound these variables.\n\nStarting with the first equation: p² + 2q = k(q + r). Let's rearrange this: p² + 2q = kq + kr. Then, p² = q(k - 2) + kr. Since p, q, r are primes, and k is a positive integer, maybe k is not too large. Let's think about possible values of k. Since p² is equal to q(k - 2) + kr, and p is a prime, p² is at least 4 (if p=2). Let's consider possible k values.\n\nSuppose k=1: Then p² = q(1 - 2) + r*1 => p² = -q + r. But since p, q, r are positive primes, this would imply r = p² + q. Since r is a prime, r must be greater than p². But primes grow faster than quadratic, so perhaps for small p's, this could work. Let's check with p=2: p²=4. So 4 = -q + r => r = q + 4. Since q and r are primes, q must be a prime such that q + 4 is also prime. For example, q=3, r=7 (3+4=7). Then r=7. So (p,q,r)=(2,3,7). Let's check if this triplet works for all three fractions.\n\nFirst fraction: (2² + 2*3)/(3 + 7) = (4 + 6)/10 = 10/10 = 1, which is natural. Second fraction: (3² + 9*7)/(7 + 2) = (9 + 63)/9 = 72/9 = 8, which is natural. Third fraction: (7² + 3*2)/(2 + 3) = (49 + 6)/5 = 55/5 = 11, which is natural. So (2,3,7) is a valid triplet. Let's note that down.\n\nWait, but we need to check if there are other triplets. Let's try k=2. Then p² = q(2 - 2) + 2r => p² = 0 + 2r => p² = 2r. So r = p² / 2. Since r is a prime, p² must be even, so p=2. Then r = 4/2 = 2. So p=2, r=2. Then q is another prime. Let's check if this works. So (p,q,r)=(2,q,2). Then the first fraction: (2² + 2q)/(q + 2) = (4 + 2q)/(q + 2). Let's compute this: (2q + 4)/(q + 2) = 2(q + 2)/(q + 2) = 2, which is natural. So the first fraction is always 2, regardless of q. Then the second fraction: (q² + 9*2)/(2 + 2) = (q² + 18)/4. This must be an integer. So (q² + 18) must be divisible by 4. Since q is a prime other than 2 (since if q=2, then r=2, so triplet (2,2,2). Let's check that. (2² + 2*2)/(2 + 2) = (4 +4)/4=8/4=2. Second fraction: (2² +9*2)/(2 +2)= (4 + 18)/4=22/4=5.5, which is not an integer. So q cannot be 2 here. Therefore, q is an odd prime. So q is an odd prime, so q² is odd, 18 is even, so q² +18 is odd + even = odd. Then (q² +18)/4 must be an integer. But odd divided by 4 is not an integer. Therefore, even if q is 3: (9 +18)/4=27/4=6.75, not integer. Similarly, q=5: (25 +18)/4=43/4=10.75, not integer. So, no solution here. Therefore, k=2 gives only the case where q can't be a prime, so no triplet from k=2.\n\nWait, but what if q is 2? Then r=2. Then triplet would be (2,2,2). Let's check that. First fraction: (4 +4)/4=2. Second fraction: (4 +18)/4=22/4=5.5, which is not integer. So even though r=2, the second fraction isn't integer. So only when k=1 and k=2, but k=2 doesn't work. So maybe k=1 is the only possibility here.\n\nNow, let's check k=3. Then p² = q(3 - 2) + 3r => p² = q + 3r. So p² = q + 3r. Since p is a prime, let's try p=2: p²=4. So 4 = q + 3r. Since q and r are primes. Let's see possible primes q and r such that q + 3r=4. The primes q and r must be at least 2. So 2 +3*2=8 >4. So no solution here. Next p=3: p²=9. Then 9 = q +3r. Let's try r=2: q=9 -6=3. So q=3, r=2. Then triplet (3,3,2). Let's check the second fraction: (3² +9*2)/(2 +3)= (9 +18)/5=27/5=5.4, not integer. So invalid. r=3: q=9 -9=0, which is not prime. r=5: q=9 -15= -6, invalid. So no solution here. p=5: p²=25. 25 = q +3r. Let's try r=2: q=25 -6=19 (prime). So q=19, r=2. Check triplet (5,19,2). Now check all three fractions. First: (25 + 2*19)/(19 +2)= (25 +38)/21=63/21=3, which is integer. Second: (19² +9*2)/(2 +5)= (361 +18)/7=379/7≈54.14, not integer. So invalid. Next, r=3: q=25 -9=16, not prime. r=5: q=25 -15=10, not prime. r=7: q=25 -21=4, not prime. So no solution here. Similarly, higher r will make q even smaller. So no solution for p=5.\n\nWait, maybe p=7: p²=49. Then 49 = q +3r. Try r=2: q=49 -6=43 (prime). So triplet (7,43,2). Check second fraction: (43² +9*2)/(2 +7)= (1849 +18)/9=1867/9≈207.444, not integer. So invalid. Similarly, other r's would give q even smaller. So no solution here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe higher k. Let's try k=3 again but with different q and r. Wait, no, because p² = q +3r, and p is prime. So unless q +3r is a square of a prime, which seems unlikely. Let's see: p=7, q=43, r=2, sum 45, which is 6² +9=57, not a square. So no.\n\nHmm, maybe k=3 doesn't yield any solutions. Let's try k=4. Then p² = q(4 -2) +4r => p²=2q +4r => p²=2(q +2r). So p² must be twice a sum of primes. Let's try p=2: p²=4. So 4=2(q +2r) => q +2r=2. But primes q and r are at least 2, so q +2r ≥2 +4=6 >2. No solution. p=3: p²=9. 9=2(q +2r). Then q +2r=4.5, which is not integer. So no solution. p=5: p²=25. 25=2(q +2r) => q +2r=12.5. Not integer. p=7: 49=2(q +2r) => q +2r=24.5. Not integer. So no solutions here either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k is larger. Let's try k=6. Then p² = q(6 -2) +6r => p²=4q +6r. Let's try p=2: 4=4q +6r. Since q and r are primes ≥2. 4q +6r ≥4*2 +6*2=8 +12=20 >4. No solution. p=3: 9=4q +6r. Let's see possible q and r. q and r primes. Trying q=2: 4*2=8, so 6r=1, which is impossible. q=3: 4*3=12, 6r= -3, impossible. So no solution. p=5: 25=4q +6r. Let's see. q=2: 4*2=8, 6r=17, which is not divisible by 6. q=3: 12, 6r=13, no. q=5: 20, 6r=5, no. So no solution. p=7: 49=4q +6r. Let's see q=2: 8, 6r=41, nope. q=3: 12, 6r=37, nope. q=5: 20, 6r=29, nope. q=7: 28, 6r=21, r=3.5, not integer. So no solution here.\n\nThis approach might not be efficient. Maybe let's look for possible values of k, m, n. Since each equation has a similar structure, maybe there's a symmetry or a way to relate them. Let's consider the second equation: (q² +9r)/(r + p) = m. Similarly, the third equation is (r² +3p)/(p + q) = n.\n\nLooking at these equations, perhaps we can find relations between p, q, and r. Let's see. Suppose we denote the three equations:\n\n1. (p² + 2q)/(q + r) = k\n2. (q² +9r)/(r + p) = m\n3.

Since primes are 2,3,5,7,11, etc., and their combinations, perhaps only small primes will work.\n\nWe already found (2,3,7). Let's see if there are others. Let's try p=2. Then the first equation becomes (4 + 2q)/(q + r) = k. Let's compute for p=2.\n\nSo (4 + 2q)/(q + r) must be integer. Let's denote this as k.\n\nThen, 4 + 2q = k(q + r) => 4 + 2q = kq + kr => 4 = q(k - 2) + kr.\n\nSo 4 - q(k - 2) = kr. Since q and r are primes, let's see possible values. Let's try k=1: Then 4 = q(1 - 2) + r*1 => 4 = -q + r => r = q +4. Since r is a prime, q must be a prime such that q +4 is also prime. Possible q's:\n\nq=3: r=7 (prime)\nq=5: r=9 (not prime)\nq=7: r=11 (prime)\nq=2: r=6 (not prime)\nq=11: r=15 (not prime)\nq=13", "answer": "On note $F(p,q,r) = \\frac{p^2 + 2q}{q+r}$, $G(p,q,r) = \\frac{q^2 + 9r}{r+p}$ et $H(p,q,r) = \\frac{r^2 + 3p}{p+q}$.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that finding a minimum usually involves calculus, specifically taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. But wait, x^x isn't a straightforward function. It's an exponential function with both the base and the exponent being the same variable. That might make taking the derivative a bit tricky because of the variable in the exponent. Let me recall how to differentiate such functions.\n\nFirst, maybe I should rewrite the function in a different form to make differentiation easier. The function x^x can be rewritten using natural logarithms. Since x^x is the same as e^(ln(x^x)), and ln(x^x) is x*ln(x). So, f(x) = e^(x*ln(x)). That might help because now I can use the chain rule to differentiate it.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nf(x) = e^(x*ln(x))\n\nNow, to find the minimum, I need to find the critical points by taking the derivative f'(x) and setting it equal to zero. Let's compute the derivative.\n\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative of e^u is e^u * u', where u = x*ln(x). So,\n\nf'(x) = e^(x*ln(x)) * (d/dx [x*ln(x)])\n\nNow, I need to compute the derivative of x*ln(x). That's a product of two functions: x and ln(x). Applying the product rule here:\n\nd/dx [x*ln(x)] = 1*ln(x) + x*(1/x) = ln(x) + 1\n\nSo, putting it back into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = e^(x*ln(x)) * (ln(x) + 1)\n\nBut wait, e^(x*ln(x)) is actually x^x, so we can simplify that part:\n\nf'(x) = x^x * (ln(x) + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is x^x multiplied by (ln(x) + 1). To find critical points, we set this equal to zero:\n\nx^x * (ln(x) + 1) = 0\n\nNow, x^x is always positive for x > 0, so the equation simplifies to:\n\nln(x) + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nln(x) = -1\n\nExponentiating both sides:\n\nx = e^(-1) = 1/e\n\nSo, the critical point is at x = 1/e. Now, we need to check if this is a minimum. Since the problem asks for the minimum, and given that x is in the positive real numbers, we should verify whether this critical point is indeed a minimum.\n\nOne way to check is to use the second derivative test. Let's compute the second derivative f''(x).\n\nFirst, let's recall that f'(x) = x^x * (ln(x) + 1). To find f''(x), we need to differentiate this product. Let me denote u = x^x and v = ln(x) + 1. Then, f'(x) = u*v, so by the product rule:\n\nf''(x) = u'*v + u*v'\n\nFirst, compute u' = derivative of x^x, which we already found earlier as x^x*(ln(x) + 1). Wait, no, actually, u = x^x, so u' is x^x*(ln(x) + 1). Wait, that's the same as f'(x). So, u' = f'(x). Wait, maybe I confused variables here. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, f(x) = x^x, so u = x^x, so u' = f'(x) = x^x*(ln(x) + 1). Then, v = ln(x) + 1, so v' = 1/x.\n\nTherefore, f''(x) = u'*v + u*v' = [x^x*(ln(x) + 1)]*(ln(x) + 1) + x^x*(1/x)\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n= x^x*(ln(x) + 1)^2 + x^x*(1/x)\n\nFactor out x^x:\n\n= x^x [ (ln(x) + 1)^2 + 1/x ]\n\nNow, since x > 0, x^x is always positive. Therefore, the sign of f''(x) is determined by the term inside the brackets: (ln(x) + 1)^2 + 1/x.\n\nSince both terms (ln(x) + 1)^2 and 1/x are positive for all x > 0, then f''(x) is positive everywhere. Therefore, the function f(x) is concave upward everywhere on its domain, which means that the critical point we found at x = 1/e is indeed a minimum.\n\nAlternatively, we could test values around x = 1/e to confirm whether it's a minimum. For example, take x slightly less than 1/e and slightly greater than 1/e and see if f(x) increases on both sides. Let's check x = 1/e - ε and x = 1/e + ε for a small ε.\n\nBut since we already proved via the second derivative test that the function is concave upward, and the critical point is the only one, we can conclude it's a minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(x) occurs at x = 1/e. To find the minimum value, substitute x = 1/e into f(x):\n\nf(1/e) = (1/e)^(1/e)\n\nBut let me confirm this. Since (1/e)^(1/e) is the same as e^(-1/e). Because (1/e) = e^(-1), so (e^(-1))^(1/e) = e^(-1/e). So, the minimum value is e^(-1/e).\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as (1/e)^{1/e} or e^{-1/e}.\n\nTo make sure, let's recap:\n\n1. Function f(x) = x^x.\n2. Expressed as e^{x ln x}.\n3. Took derivative using chain rule: e^{x ln x}*(ln x + 1).\n4. Set derivative to zero: ln x + 1 = 0 => x = 1/e.\n5. Second derivative test: showed that f''(x) is positive everywhere, hence x = 1/e is a minimum.\n6. Evaluated f(1/e) = (1/e)^{1/e}.\n\nTherefore, the minimum is at x = 1/e with value (1/e)^{1/e}.\n\nI think that's thorough. Let me just check if there's any possibility I made a mistake in differentiation. For example, when differentiating x^x, is the derivative correctly calculated? Yes, because x^x = e^{x ln x}, whose derivative is e^{x ln x}*(ln x + 1). So that's correct. Then, the critical point is at x = 1/e, and the second derivative is positive, confirming a minimum. The value computation seems right as well.\n\nAnother way to check the value is to compute (1/e)^{1/e}. Let me compute ln((1/e)^{1/e}) = (1/e)*ln(1/e) = (1/e)*(-1) = -1/e. Exponentiating gives e^{-1/e}, which is the same as (1/e)^{1/e}. So, that's consistent.\n\nYes, I think that's all. The minimum is at x = 1/e and the value is e^{-1/e} or (1/e)^{1/e}. So, the boxed answer should be \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{e} \\right)^{1/e}} or \\boxed{e^{-1/e}}. Probably, the former is more standard, but both are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum of the function is \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{e} \\right)^{1/e}}.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French. I can guess that the user will prefer an French response.

Hmm, first, part 1: With two disks of radius r < 1, can we cover the unit disk D? And part 2 asks for the smallest r for three disks. Alright, let me start with the first question.\n\nSo, the unit disk has radius 1. We need to place two smaller disks, each with radius r, such that every point in D is inside at least one of these two disks. What's the minimum r needed? Well, if we use two disks, how do they have to be positioned? Maybe one centered at the center of D, and the other positioned somewhere else. But if r is too small, the other disk might not reach the edge.\n\nWait, if we place one disk at the center, then the other disk would need to cover the remaining part of D. Let's think: the distance from the center of D to the edge is 1. If we have a disk of radius r, centered somewhere, the farthest point of this disk from the center would be at a distance of r from its center. So, if we place the second disk such that the farthest point of its edge is still within D, the distance from the center of D to the center of the second disk plus r must be <= 1. So, if the center of the second disk is at a distance d from the center of D, then d + r <= 1. But to cover the entire disk, the second disk must reach from its edge to the edge of D. Wait, maybe the two disks need to be arranged such that their union is D. So, perhaps placing them symmetrically? Like, one at the center and the other somewhere along a radius, but not too far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both disks are placed such that their centers are separated by some distance, and each has radius r. The challenge is to position them so that every point in D is inside at least one of the two disks. So, the union of the two disks must cover the unit disk. What's the minimal r for which this is possible?\n\nI remember something about covering a disk with two smaller disks. Maybe the minimal r is 1/2? Let me check. If we place two disks each of radius 1/2 centered at the center of D and somewhere else. Wait, but if they are both centered at the center, then they only cover half the disk each, but overlapping. Wait, no. If they are both centered at the center, each with radius 1/2, then the union would be a circle with radius 1/2, which is only half of D. So that's not covering the entire unit disk. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place one disk at the center and another disk somewhere such that it covers the rest. For example, if we place the second disk such that its center is at a distance of 1 - r from the center of D. Then, the farthest point of this disk from the center would be (1 - r) + r = 1, which touches the edge. So, if the second disk is placed at a distance of 1 - r from the center, then it would just touch the edge of D. But wait, does this disk cover the entire disk? Let me visualize.\n\nSuppose the first disk is at the center, radius r. The second disk is at distance 1 - r from the center, radius r. Then, the union of these two disks would cover the entire unit disk. Because any point in D is either within the first disk (radius r from center), or within the second disk. Wait, but if the second disk is at distance 1 - r, then the farthest point of the second disk from the center is (1 - r) + r = 1. So, the second disk touches the edge. But does the first disk cover everything? For points in D, if they are within distance r from the center, they are covered by the first disk. For points further away, they need to be within radius r of the second disk's center. The second disk is at distance 1 - r from the center, so the distance from any point in D to the second disk's center is at most (1 - r) + 1 = 2 - r. But since r < 1, 2 - r > 1. So, that doesn't help. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two disks are placed such that their centers are symmetric with respect to the center of D, and each covers half of D. Let me think. If we place one disk at the center, radius r, and another disk at some point, also radius r, such that together they cover the entire unit disk.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two disks of radius r < 1\". So both have to be of radius r. So, if we place one at the center, radius r, then the other disk needs to cover the remaining part. The question is: how far from the center must the second disk be placed so that every point in D is within at least one of the two disks.\n\nSo, suppose we have the first disk at the center, and the second disk somewhere else. Let's denote the center of the second disk as point C, which is at distance d from the center of D. Then, the union of the two disks must cover D. So, for any point P in D, either P is within r of the center, or P is within r of point C.\n\nTo ensure that, the maximum distance from C to any point in D must be <= 2r. Wait, but if C is placed at distance d from the center, then the distance from C to the edge of D is 1 + d. So, to cover all points up to 1, the distance from C to the edge must be <= 1 - r. Because if a point is on the edge of D, it's 1 unit from the center. So, if the distance from C to that point is <= r, then that point is covered by the second disk. But the maximum distance from C to the edge is 1 + d (if C is on the edge of D). Wait, no. If C is at distance d from the center, then the farthest point from C on D would be along the line connecting the center to C, extended to the edge. That distance would be 1 (radius) + d. So, to have that distance <= 2r (since the second disk has radius r), we need 1 + d <= 2r. But the edge of the first disk is at r, so the center of the second disk must be at distance d = 1 - r, and then 1 + (1 - r) = 2 - r. So, 2 - r <= 2r => 2 <= 3r => r >= 2/3 ≈ 0.666. But since we want the minimal r, maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two disks each need to cover half of D. If they are placed symmetrically, such that each covers a semicircle. But how?\n\nWait, if we place two disks each of radius r, such that their centers are separated by some distance, and each covers half of D. For example, if the two disks are placed at opposite ends of a diameter, each covering a semicircle. But the problem is that each disk has radius r, so the semicircle would have to be covered by each disk. So, the distance from the center of D to the center of each disk must be <= 1 - r. But if they are on opposite sides, the centers would be separated by 2(1 - r). Then, the distance between the centers is 2(1 - r). For the union of the two disks to cover D, the distance between the centers must be <= 2r. So, 2(1 - r) <= 2r => 1 - r <= r => 1 <= 2r => r >= 1/2. So, if r >= 1/2, then the two disks can be placed diametrically opposite, each with radius 1/2, such that their centers are 1 unit apart, so that the distance between centers is 1, which is equal to 2r when r=1/2. Wait, 2r would be 1 when r=1/2. So, the distance between centers is 1, which is equal to 2r. Then, by the triangle inequality, the entire disk would be covered. Because any point in D is within 1 unit from the center, and if the centers are 1 unit apart, then any point in D is within r=1/2 from either center. Wait, maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose we have two disks of radius 1/2, centered at (0,0) and (1,0). The distance between the centers is 1. Then, the union of these two disks would cover the entire unit disk. Let's check a point on the edge of D, say (1,0). It's covered by the second disk. A point at (0.5, 0.5). The distance from (0.5, 0.5) to both centers is sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. Since each disk has radius 0.5, which is less than 0.707, so that point is not covered. Wait, that's a problem. So, placing two disks of radius 1/2 centered diametrically opposite might not cover the entire disk.\n\nWait, so maybe my previous reasoning was flawed. Let me think again. If we have two disks of radius r, placed at centers separated by distance d. For the union to cover D, every point in D must be within r of at least one center. So, the maximum distance from either center to any point in D must be <= r. But the farthest point from either center is 1 unit from the center of D. So, if one center is at distance d from the center of D, then the farthest point from the other center is 1 + d. To have 1 + d <= 2r (since the other center is at distance d from the first, so the farthest point from the second center is 1 (radius) + d. Wait, but if the first center is at distance d from the center of D, then the second center is at distance d from the first, so the distance from the second center to the edge of D is 1 + d. So, to cover the edge, we need 1 + d <= 2r. But we also need to cover points between the two centers. The distance between the two centers is d, so the points between them are within d/2 from each. So, to cover those, the radius r must be at least d/2. So, we have two conditions:\n\n1. 1 + d <= 2r\n\n2. r >= d/2\n\nBut we also want to minimize r. Let's express d in terms of r. From condition 2: d <= 2r. From condition 1: d >= (2r - 1). So, combining these, 2r - 1 <= d <= 2r. But d must be positive, so 2r - 1 >= 0 => r >= 0.5. So, if r >= 0.5, then d can be set such that d = 2r - 1. Wait, but d must also be <= 2r. So, 2r - 1 <= 2r => -1 <= 0, which is always true. So, for r >= 0.5, we can set d = 2r - 1. But we need to check if this works.\n\nWait, if d = 2r - 1, then the distance between the two centers is 2r -1. Then, the farthest point from the second center is 1 + (2r -1) = 2r. So, that's covered by the first disk. The distance between the two centers is 2r -1, so the midpoint between the two centers is at distance (2r -1)/2 from each center. So, the maximum distance from any point in D to either center is 2r, which is covered by the first disk. Wait, but does this ensure that all points are covered?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let’s say r = 0.6. Then d = 2*0.6 -1 = 0.2. So, two disks of radius 0.6, centers separated by 0.2. The first disk is at the center, the second is at (0.2, 0). Then, the farthest point from the second disk is the edge of D, which is 1 unit from the center, but the second disk is at 0.2 from the center. So, the distance from the second disk to the edge is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Since the radius is 0.6, 0.8 > 0.6, so that point isn't covered. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning is flawed. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two disks should be arranged such that their centers are both inside D, and their union covers D. So, the two centers must be placed such that every point in D is within r of at least one center.\n\nThis is equivalent to the union of two disks of radius r each, centered at two points, covering the entire unit disk. The minimal r needed.\n\nI recall that in covering a disk with two smaller disks, the minimal radius r is 1/2, but maybe not. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we have two disks of radius 1/2. If we place them at the center and somewhere else, such that their union covers D. Let's place the second disk at (1,0). Then, the distance from the second disk to the center is 1. If the radius is 1/2, then the distance from the second disk to the edge is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Wait, no. The distance between centers is 1. So, the farthest point from the second disk is the edge of D, which is 1 unit from the center. The distance from the second disk to that point is 1 + (1 - 1/2) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5? Wait, no. Wait, the distance from the center of the second disk to the edge is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Wait, that's not right. If the second disk is centered at (1,0), radius 0.5, then the farthest point from the second disk is the point diametrically opposite, which would be (-1,0). The distance from (-1,0) to (1,0) is 2, but the radius of the second disk is 0.5, so the distance from (-", "answer": "\\textbf{1.} Deux disques de rayon $r$ définissent une bande de plan de largeur $2r$.

{"original_question": "Quelle est la somme de tous les nombres dont l’écriture décimale est une suite strictement croissante ou strictement décroissante de chiffres ?", "question": "Quelle est la somme de tous les nombres dont l’écriture décimale est une suite strictement croissante ou strictement décroissante de chiffres ?", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the sum of all numbers where the decimal representation is either a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence of digits. Hmm, let's start by understanding what that means. \n\nFirst, a strictly increasing sequence of digits would be numbers like 123, 13579, etc., where each digit is larger than the one before. Similarly, a strictly decreasing sequence would be numbers like 9630, 7531, 8521, etc., where each digit is smaller than the previous. Then, numbers that are both increasing and decreasing would be single-digit numbers, right? Because if a number has more than one digit, it can't be both increasing and decreasing. \n\nSo the problem is asking for the sum of all such numbers. Let me break this down into parts: \n\n1. **Single-digit numbers**: These are from 0 to 9. Their sum is straightforward. 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.\n\n2. **Strictly increasing numbers**: These have digits in increasing order. For example, 12, 13, ..., 98. How do I count all such numbers, and what is their sum?\n\n3. **Strictly decreasing numbers**: These have digits in decreasing order. But here, there's a catch. The number 0 cannot be part of a decreasing sequence because you can't have a digit after 0 that's larger. For example, 0 cannot be followed by 1. Also, numbers like 3210 would be decreasing, but 0 can't be the last digit. Wait, but 0 can be at the beginning? No, because leading zeros aren't allowed in numbers. So, strictly decreasing numbers must start with the highest digit possible and then go down, but 0 can't be included because that would require the first digit to be 0, which isn't allowed. So actually, strictly decreasing numbers can't include 0 at all. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me think again. If a number is strictly decreasing, its digits must be in decreasing order without leading zeros. So, for example, 987654321 is a valid decreasing number, but 0 cannot be a digit because you can't have a digit after 0 that's larger. So, numbers like 987654321, 98765432, ..., 1023456789 is not possible because 0 is in the middle. Wait, no, 1023456789 is not decreasing because 0 is followed by 2, which is higher. So actually, a strictly decreasing number cannot contain 0 at all. So all strictly decreasing numbers are sequences of digits from 9 down to some digit, without including 0. \n\nSimilarly, strictly increasing numbers can include 0? Wait, no. Because if you have a number like 0123, that's actually 123, which is a three-digit number, but leading zeros are not allowed. So, strictly increasing numbers must start with a non-zero digit and then each subsequent digit is larger. So, for example, 1234, 1245, ..., 9876543210 is invalid because it includes 0. So, strictly increasing numbers are sequences like 1234, 1239, ..., 987654321, but not including 0.\n\nTherefore, strictly increasing numbers cannot include 0, and strictly decreasing numbers also cannot include 0. So both types of numbers are sequences of digits where each digit is either increasing or decreasing, but without 0. Therefore, strictly increasing numbers start from 1 to 9, and strictly decreasing numbers start from 9 down to 1, but without 0.\n\nSo, first, let's handle strictly increasing numbers. How many are there? For n-digit numbers where the digits are strictly increasing. To form such a number, we need to choose n distinct digits from 1 to 9 (since 0 is excluded) and arrange them in increasing order. The number of such numbers is C(9, n) for each n from 1 to 9 digits (since there are 9 digits available: 1-9). Similarly, for strictly decreasing numbers, we need to choose digits from 9 to 1, but since order is decreasing, it's the same as choosing n digits from 9 digits (0-9), but excluding 0? Wait, no. Wait, if we choose digits from 9 down to 1, but 0 is allowed in the middle? Wait, no. Wait, for strictly decreasing numbers, digits must be in decreasing order, so digits can include 0, but the number can't start with 0. So, for example, 9630 is valid because it's 9,6,3,0, which is decreasing. But 0 cannot be part of a number if it's the first digit. So, strictly decreasing numbers are sequences of digits from 9 down to 0, but starting with a digit from 9 down to 1, then each subsequent digit is smaller. Wait, but 0 can be part of the sequence as long as it's not the first digit. So, for example, 5320 is valid because it's 5,3,2,0. Similarly, 9630 is valid. So, the strictly decreasing numbers can include 0 as long as it's not the first digit. Therefore, the digits allowed for strictly decreasing numbers are 0-9, but the number must start with a digit from 9 down to 1, and then each subsequent digit is smaller. Wait, but 0 can be included in the middle. So, the strictly decreasing numbers can be formed by choosing any subset of digits from 9 down to 0, with the condition that the first digit is not 0, and each subsequent digit is smaller than the previous. So, similar to combinations. \n\nBut wait, how many strictly decreasing numbers are there? For each possible length from 1 to 10 digits (since there are 10 digits from 0-9). For each length n, the number of strictly decreasing numbers is C(10, n), because you can choose any n distinct digits from 0-9 (since 0 is allowed in the middle), but the number must start with a digit from 9 down to 1, and then arrange the remaining digits in decreasing order. Wait, but if you choose 0, you have to make sure that it's not the first digit. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. If you choose digits from 0-9, and arrange them in decreasing order, the resulting number will have all digits in decreasing order, but the first digit can't be 0. However, if you choose 0 as one of the digits, then in the decreasing order, 0 would come last, so the number would start with 9, 8, ..., down to the digits you chose. Therefore, actually, the number of strictly decreasing numbers is equal to the number of subsets of {9,8,...,0} with size at least 1, but ensuring that the subset is non-empty and that when arranged in decreasing order, the first digit is not 0. However, since the digits are arranged in decreasing order, if 0 is included in the subset, it will be the last digit. Therefore, the first digit is always greater than 0, so all subsets of size n >=1 will result in a strictly decreasing number when arranged in decreasing order. Therefore, the number of strictly decreasing numbers is C(10, n) for each n from 1 to 10. Wait, but 10 digits (0-9), so subsets of size 1 to 10. But for n=10, it's only one number: 9876543210. However, 0 can't be part of the subset if we have n=10 because digits must be distinct. Wait, no, if we choose all 10 digits, then arranging them in decreasing order would give 9876543210, which is valid. So, actually, the number of strictly decreasing numbers is C(10,1) + C(10,2) + ... + C(10,10) = 2^10 -1 = 1023. But wait, the problem is that numbers like 0 cannot be part of a number if they are the first digit. But since we are arranging the digits in decreasing order, the only way 0 would be in the first position is if we have a number like 0123... which is invalid. Therefore, all subsets of {0-9} with size >=1, when arranged in decreasing order, will result in a valid number. Therefore, the total number of strictly decreasing numbers is 2^10 -1 = 1023. But hold on, this includes numbers like 9876543210, which is 10 digits. However, when we compute the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers, we need to account for each number's value. Similarly for strictly increasing numbers.\n\nBut let's confirm this. For strictly decreasing numbers, each number is a permutation of a subset of {9,8,...,0} arranged in decreasing order. Therefore, each subset corresponds to exactly one strictly decreasing number. Therefore, the number of strictly decreasing numbers is 2^10 -1 = 1023. Similarly, the number of strictly increasing numbers is C(9,1) + C(9,2) + ... + C(9,9) = 2^9 -1 = 511. Wait, but the problem says \"the sum of all numbers whose decimal representation is a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence of digits\". So, strictly increasing numbers are from 1-digit to 9-digit numbers, and strictly decreasing numbers are from 1-digit to 10-digit numbers (since 10-digit numbers can include 0). But as we saw, all subsets of {9,8,...,0} of size >=1 correspond to a strictly decreasing number when arranged in decreasing order, so total of 1023 strictly decreasing numbers. Similarly, strictly increasing numbers are subsets of {1,2,...,9} of size >=1, which is 511. Therefore, total numbers considered are 1023 + 511 = 1534. But wait, but some numbers might be counted in both categories? For example, 123 is in both strictly increasing and decreasing? No, because a number can't be both unless it's a single-digit number, which is already counted. So, single-digit numbers are in both. So total numbers considered are 511 + 1023 - 9 (since the single-digit numbers are counted in both). Wait, actually, the single-digit numbers are 0-9, which are 10 numbers. But the problem says \"decimal representation is a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence of digits\". So, 0 is a single-digit number, but if we consider strictly increasing or decreasing, 0 is both increasing and decreasing. Wait, but the problem says \"the sum of all numbers whose decimal representation is a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence of digits\". So, perhaps 0 is included? But in standard definitions, a single-digit number is considered both increasing and decreasing. However, in some contexts, strictly increasing and decreasing can exclude single-digit numbers. But the problem doesn't specify, so we have to consider 0 as a valid number. Therefore, the total numbers to consider are:\n\n- Strictly increasing numbers: 1-digit to 9-digit numbers, total 511 numbers.\n\n- Strictly decreasing numbers: 1-digit to 10-digit numbers, total 1023 numbers.\n\nBut overlapping is only the single-digit numbers (0-9), which are 10 numbers. Therefore, total numbers considered are 511 + 1023 - 9 = 1530 + 10? Wait, 511 + 1023 = 1534, subtract 10 to account for single-digit overlap: 1534 -10=1524. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no. If there are 10 single-digit numbers that are counted in both strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, then the total distinct numbers are 511 + 1023 -10=1524. So, 1524 numbers in total. Therefore, the sum we need is the sum of all strictly increasing numbers plus the sum of all strictly decreasing numbers minus the sum of all single-digit numbers (since they are counted twice). \n\nBut let's verify. Each single-digit number is in both strictly increasing and strictly decreasing. So, when we sum them, we have to subtract them once to avoid double-counting. Therefore, total sum = (sum of strictly increasing numbers) + (sum of strictly decreasing numbers) - (sum of single-digit numbers). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating:\n\n1. Sum of strictly increasing numbers.\n\n2. Sum of strictly decreasing numbers.\n\n3. Sum of single-digit numbers (0-9).\n\nThen subtract step 3 from step 1 + step 2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of single-digit numbers. That's 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45.\n\nNext, sum of strictly increasing numbers. As established earlier, there are 511 such numbers. Each is a combination of digits from 1 to 9, arranged in increasing order. So, for each subset of size k (where k ranges from 1 to 9), there is exactly one strictly increasing number. The sum of all strictly increasing numbers is the sum over all subsets of {1,2,...,9} of size k, multiplied by 1 (since each subset corresponds to exactly one number, which is the digits arranged in increasing order). \n\nBut how do we compute this sum? \n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), the contribution of each digit to the total sum can be calculated by considering how many times each digit appears in each position across all strictly increasing numbers.\n\nFor example, for a 3-digit strictly increasing number, the hundreds place can be 1, 2, ..., 7 (since the digits must be increasing, the smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the largest is 7, because after 7, the next digit would have to be 8, but 7 is the third digit in 127, which is not increasing). Wait, actually, the hundreds digit can be any digit from 1 to 7, because the three digits must be increasing. Similarly, the tens digit can be from the hundreds digit +1 to 8, and the units digit from tens digit +1 to 9. \n\nWait, more generally, for a k-digit strictly increasing number, the digits are a1 < a2 < ... < ak, where a1 is from 1 to 9, a2 from a1+1 to 9, etc.", "answer": "Commençons par remarquer que ces nombres s’écrivant dans le système décimal avec au plus $9$ chiffres (cas croissant) ou $10$ chiffres (cas décroissant), car le chiffre le plus à gauche ne peut être $0$. \n\nUne idée est de faire correspondre à chaque nombre $a$ s’écrivant avec $k$ chiffres en ordre croissant un nombre $b$ dont les chiffres, en ordre décroissant, seraient les compléments à $9$ des chiffres de $a$ (cela ferait des sommes deux à deux ne s’écrivant qu’avec des $9$).

Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about polynomial equations and their roots. \n\nFirst, I remember that a cubic equation can have either one real root and two complex conjugate roots or three real roots. So, the problem is asking for the values of \\( a \\) where it's exactly two real roots. Wait, but cubics have three roots in total (counting multiplicities), so having exactly two real roots would mean one of them is a repeated root. Therefore, the equation must have a multiple root, and the other two roots are distinct. \n\nAlright, so the key here is that the cubic equation has a double root and a simple root. To find such values of \\( a \\), I should use the concept of discriminants. The discriminant of a cubic equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\) is given by \\( \\Delta = 18pqr - 4p^3r + p^2q^2 - 4q^3 - 27r^2 \\). If the discriminant is zero, the equation has a multiple root. But wait, the standard form is \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\), but my equation is \\( x^3 + a x - 2(a + 4) = 0 \\). So, let me rewrite that equation in standard form.\n\nComparing \\( x^3 + a x - 2(a + 4) = 0 \\) with \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\), we can see that \\( p = 0 \\), \\( q = a \\), and \\( r = -2(a + 4) \\). Plugging these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\( \\Delta = 18*0*a*(-2(a + 4)) - 4*0^3*(-2(a + 4)) + 0^2*a^2 - 4*a^3 - 27*(-2(a + 4))^2 \\)\n\nSimplifying term by term:\n\nFirst term: \\( 18*0*a*(-2(a + 4)) = 0 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( -4*0^3*(-2(a + 4)) = 0 \\)\n\nThird term: \\( 0^2*a^2 = 0 \\)\n\nFourth term: \\( -4a^3 \\)\n\nFifth term: \\( -27*(-2(a + 4))^2 = -27*(4(a + 4)^2) = -108(a + 4)^2 \\)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\( \\Delta = 0 + 0 + 0 -4a^3 -108(a + 4)^2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the discriminant simplifies to:\n\n\\( \\Delta = -4a^3 -108(a + 4)^2 \\)\n\nWe need the discriminant to be zero for the equation to have a multiple root. So set \\( \\Delta = 0 \\):\n\n\\( -4a^3 -108(a + 4)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me factor out common terms. Both terms have a factor of -4 and -108. Let's divide through by -4 to simplify:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27(a + 4)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27(a + 4)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for \\( a \\). Let's expand the \\( (a + 4)^2 \\) term:\n\n\\( (a + 4)^2 = a^2 + 8a + 16 \\)\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27(a^2 + 8a + 16) = 0 \\)\n\nExpanding the 27:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27a^2 + 216a + 432 = 0 \\)\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27a^2 + 216a + 432 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems like a cubic equation. Maybe we can factor this. Let me check if there is a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 432 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). The factors of 432 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±9, ±12, ±16, ±18, ±24, ±36, ±72, ±108, ±216, ±432.\n\nTesting these values in the equation \\( a^3 + 27a^2 + 216a + 432 = 0 \\).\n\nLet's try \\( a = -3 \\):\n\n\\( (-3)^3 + 27*(-3)^2 + 216*(-3) + 432 = -27 + 27*9 - 648 + 432 \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n-27 + 243 - 648 + 432 = (-27 + 243) + (-648 + 432) = 216 - 216 = 0. \n\nYes! So \\( a = -3 \\) is a root. Therefore, we can factor the cubic as (a + 3)(quadratic). Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root -3:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (a^3), 27 (a^2), 216 (a), 432 (constant)\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by -3: 1*(-3) = -3. Add to next coefficient: 27 + (-3) = 24.\n\nMultiply by -3: 24*(-3) = -72. Add to next coefficient: 216 + (-72) = 144.\n\nMultiply by -3: 144*(-3) = -432. Add to last coefficient: 432 + (-432) = 0.\n\nSo the quadratic is \\( a^2 + 24a + 144 \\). Therefore, the cubic factors as:\n\n\\( (a + 3)(a^2 + 24a + 144) = 0 \\)\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( a + 3 = 0 \\) => \\( a = -3 \\)\n\n2. \\( a^2 + 24a + 144 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( a = [-24 ± sqrt(24^2 - 4*1*144)] / 2 \\)\n\nCalculating discriminant:\n\n\\( 576 - 576 = 0 \\)\n\nSo discriminant is zero, which means repeated roots:\n\n\\( a = [-24 ± 0]/2 = -12 \\)\n\nTherefore, the solutions are \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\). Wait, but the original discriminant was set to zero, which gives these roots. So, the discriminant is zero when \\( a = -3 \\) or \\( a = -12 \\). Therefore, the cubic equation has a multiple root when \\( a = -3 \\) or \\( a = -12 \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"exactly two real solutions\". So, when the equation has a multiple root and the other root is real, does that count as two real solutions? Let me think. If a cubic equation has a double root and another distinct root, then it has three real roots, but one is a double root. So, the total number of distinct real roots is two. So, in that case, the equation would have exactly two distinct real roots. Therefore, when the discriminant is zero, the equation has a multiple root and possibly another distinct root. So, for each of these values of \\( a \\), the equation has a multiple root and one distinct root, so total two real solutions (with multiplicity three). Wait, no. Wait, if there's a multiple root, then the equation has a double root and a simple root, so total two distinct real roots, but with multiplicities. So, in terms of real solutions, counting multiplicities, it's three. But the problem says \"exactly two real solutions\". So, perhaps the question is considering real solutions as distinct, regardless of multiplicity? Wait, that's ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly two real solutions\". So, in the context of polynomial equations, usually, when they say \"solutions\", they might be referring to distinct real solutions. However, in some contexts, they might include multiplicity. For example, a cubic equation can have three real roots (with multiplicities), so if they count all roots, including multiplicity, three. If they count distinct real roots, two. But the problem statement is a bit vague. However, given that the problem says \"exactly two real solutions\", and considering that a cubic can have up to three real roots, the most natural interpretation is that there are two distinct real roots, with one being a double root. Therefore, the values of \\( a \\) that make the discriminant zero (i.e., when \\( a = -3 \\) or \\( a = -12 \\)) would result in exactly two distinct real roots. However, wait, but when \\( a = -3 \\), the equation would have a double root and another real root, so total two distinct real roots. When \\( a = -12 \\), would the equation have a double root and another real root, so total two distinct real roots? Let's check.\n\nWait, but let's actually verify this. Let me take \\( a = -3 \\). Substitute back into the original equation:\n\n\\( x^3 + (-3)x - 2(-3 + 4) = x^3 - 3x - 2(1) = x^3 - 3x - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me try to factor this. Maybe rational roots. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±2.\n\nTest x=1: 1 - 3 - 2 = -4 ≠ 0\n\nTest x=2: 8 - 6 - 2 = 0. So x=2 is a root. Then, perform polynomial division or use synthetic division:\n\nDivide \\( x^3 - 3x - 2 \\) by (x - 2):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  0  -3  -2\n\n          2   4    2\n\n      1  2   1    0\n\nSo, quotient is \\( x^2 + 2x + 1 \\), which factors as \\( (x + 1)^2 \\). Therefore, the equation factors as \\( (x - 2)(x + 1)^2 \\). Therefore, roots are x=2 (simple) and x=-1 (double). So, two distinct real roots. Therefore, when \\( a = -3 \\), the equation has exactly two distinct real solutions. Similarly, check \\( a = -12 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( a = -12 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( x^3 + (-12)x - 2(-12 + 4) = x^3 - 12x - 2(-8) = x^3 - 12x + 16 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me check if x=2 is a root here:\n\n\\( 8 - 24 + 16 = 0. Yes, x=2 is a root. Perform synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  0  -12  16\n\n          2   4  -16\n\n      1  2  -8   0\n\nSo, quotient is \\( x^2 + 2x - 8 \\). Factor this quadratic:\n\nDiscriminant = 4 + 32 = 36. Roots: (-2 ±6)/2 = (4/2)=2 and (-8/2)=-4. So, factors as (x - 2)(x + 4). Therefore, the equation factors as (x - 2)^2(x + 4). Therefore, roots are x=2 (double root) and x=-4 (simple). So again, two distinct real roots. Therefore, both \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\) result in the equation having exactly two distinct real roots. \n\nHowever, wait, but the problem says \"exactly two real solutions\". If they are considering multiplicity, then when \\( a = -3 \\) or \\( a = -12 \\), the equation has a triple root (since discriminant is zero), which is a single real solution with multiplicity three. But the problem says \"exactly two real solutions\", which might refer to two distinct real solutions. Therefore, the answer should be \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\). But let me check again.\n\nWait, but the original cubic equation, when discriminant is zero, it has a multiple root and another root. So, if discriminant is zero, the equation has a multiple root and a simple root. Therefore, it has two distinct real roots. Thus, both \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\) are the values where the equation has exactly two distinct real solutions. Therefore, the answer should be \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\). \n\nBut let me check if there are any other possible values. The discriminant equation gave us \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\). Let's confirm this again.\n\nSo discriminant \\( \\Delta = -4a^3 -108(a + 4)^2 \\). Setting to zero:\n\n\\( -4a^3 -108(a + 4)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\n\\( a^3 + 27(a + 4)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nWhich led to \\( a^3 + 27(a^2 + 8a + 16) = 0 \\), simplifying to \\( a^3 + 27a^2 + 216a + 432 = 0 \\). Factoring gives \\( (a + 3)(a^2 + 24a + 144) = 0 \\). The quadratic \\( a^2 + 24a + 144 = 0 \\) has discriminant \\( 24^2 - 4*1*144 = 576 - 576 = 0 \\), so repeated root \\( a = -12 \\). Therefore, the only solutions are \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( a = -12 \\", "answer": "Une équation polynôme du troisième degré à coefficients réels possède deux solutions réelles si une de ses racines est double.\n\nIl existe donc des réels $b$ et $c$ tels que pour tout $x$ : \n\\[\nx^3 + ax - 2(a + 4) = (x - b)(x^2 - 2cx + c^2)\n\\]\n\nPar identification : \n\\[\n0 = -b - 2c, \\quad a = 2bc + c^2, \\quad b c^2 = -2(a + 4)\n\\]\n\nOn a donc $b = -2c$, $a = -3c^2$ et $a = c^3 - 4$.\n\nLa deuxième égalité indique que $a < 0$ et on obtient la condition nécessaire sur $c$ : \n\\[\nc^3 + 3c^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nC’est-à-dire :\n\\[\n(c - 1)(c^2 + 4c + 4) = 0.\n\\]\n\nOn obtient donc une première solution, avec $c = 1$ et donc $a = -3$. \n\n\\[\nc^2 + 4c + 4 = (c + 2)^2 \\quad \\text{et} \\quad c = -2 \\quad \\text{donne} \\quad a = -12\n\\]\n\nDans le premier cas, les racines sont $-1$ et $1$, dans le second elles sont $2$ et $-4$.\n"}

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since we're dealing with quadratics that have integer solutions, maybe I can use the fact that the solutions must be rational (by the Rational Root Theorem) and then check if they are integers. But wait, actually, the problem says \"at least one integer solution,\" so even if there are two integer solutions, that's okay. So, maybe instead of looking for both equations to have integer solutions, I can just require that each equation has at least one integer root, which could be one or two.\n\nBut quadratic equations can have at most two integer solutions. So, for each equation, there's either one solution (a double root) or two solutions. Since m and n are natural numbers, we need to ensure that the discriminants of both quadratics are non-negative, so that real roots exist. But since the problem says \"at least one integer solution,\" we don't need to worry about complex roots here.\n\nLet me start by recalling that if a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has an integer solution, then that solution must divide the constant term c. So, for the equation x² + m x + n = 0, any integer solution k must satisfy k divides n. Similarly, for the equation x² + n x + m = 0, any integer solution l must satisfy l divides m.\n\nBut wait, the coefficients here are m and n, so the possible integer roots for the first equation are divisors of n, and for the second equation, the integer roots are divisors of m. But since m and n are natural numbers, their divisors are positive integers (since n and m are non-zero natural numbers, their divisors are also positive integers).\n\nSo, maybe I can approach this by considering possible integer roots for each equation and then relating them to m and n.\n\nLet me denote the integer solutions for the first equation x² + m x + n = 0 as k and l (but actually, since it's a quadratic, there are at most two roots, but the problem says \"at least one integer solution,\" so maybe one of them is an integer). Similarly for the second equation, let's say p and q, with at least one integer.\n\nBut since m and n are natural numbers, their possible integer roots must divide each other. Wait, for the first equation, if k is an integer root, then k divides n, and similarly, if l is another integer root, then l divides n. But since the equation is x² + m x + n = 0, the sum of the roots is -m and the product is n. So, if k is an integer root, then the other root must be such that k + other_root = -m and k * other_root = n. Similarly for the second equation.\n\nSo, maybe I can parametrize the possible integer roots for each equation. Let's do that.\n\nFor the first equation, x² + m x + n = 0. Suppose it has integer root k. Then, the other root is (-m - k). The product of the roots is n, so k * (-m - k) = n. So, n = -k(m + k). Since n is a natural number, -k(m + k) must be positive. Therefore, k must be negative because m and k are both integers. Wait, m is a natural number, so m ≥ 1. If k is negative, then m + k would be 1 + (-1) = 0, but m is at least 1, so m + k would be at least 0. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, if k is negative, then m + k must be positive because n = -k(m + k) must be natural. Let's see:\n\nIf k is negative, then -k is positive. Then, n = (-k)(m + k) must be positive. Since m is natural, m + k must also be positive. So, m + k > 0 ⇒ k > -m.\n\nBut k is a negative integer, so k ≥ -m -1? Wait, not necessarily. For example, if m = 1, k could be -2, but then m + k = -1, which would make n = (-k)(-1) = 2. So, n would be positive. But if m = 1 and k = -2, then the other root is -m - k = -1 - (-2) = 1. Then the product is (-2)(1) = -2, but n is supposed to be positive. Wait, that's a contradiction. So, maybe my reasoning is off.\n\nWait, wait, let's do this properly. Let me denote the roots. Let's say for the first equation, x² + m x + n = 0, the roots are k and l (integers). Then, we have:\n\nk + l = -m\n\nk * l = n\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, x² + n x + m = 0, the roots are p and q (integers), so:\n\np + q = -n\n\np * q = m\n\nSo, we have these equations. Now, since m and n are natural numbers, their product k * l must be natural, so k and l must be integers with opposite signs (since their product is positive). But if k is positive and l is negative, their sum would be negative, which would mean that -m is negative, so m is positive, which is given. Similarly, if k and l are both negative, their product is positive, and their sum is negative, so again m is positive. So, in either case, the sum k + l is negative, so m is positive, which is consistent. Similarly, for the second equation, p + q = -n, and p * q = m, which is positive, so p and q have the same sign.\n\nSo, let's try to find possible integers k and l for the first equation such that k * l = n and k + l = -m, where m and n are natural numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, p + q = -n and p * q = m.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express m and n in terms of k and l (for the first equation) and then substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom the first equation: m = -(k + l) and n = k * l.\n\nFrom the second equation: n = -(p + q) and m = p * q.\n\nTherefore, substituting m from the first equation into the second equation: -(p + q) = p * q ⇒ p * q + p + q = 0 ⇒ (p + 1)(q + 1) = 1. Since p and q are integers, the product (p + 1)(q + 1) = 1. The integer solutions to this are (p + 1, q + 1) = (1,1) or (-1,-1). Therefore, (p, q) = (0,0) or (-2, -2). But p and q are integers such that p * q = m and m is a natural number. So, p and q must be integers, but their product is m ≥ 1. If p = q = 0, then m = 0, which is not allowed. If p = q = -2, then m = (-2)(-2) = 4. So, the only possibility is p = q = -2, leading to m = 4. Then, from the second equation, n = -(p + q) = -(-2 + (-2)) = -(-4) = 4. So, n = 4. But also, from the first equation, m = -(p + q) = -(-4) = 4, and n = p * q = (-2)(-2) = 4. So, this gives m = 4, n = 4.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this works. Let's check the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: x² + 4x + 4 = 0. The roots are x = -2 and x = -2. So, both roots are integers. Second equation: x² + 4x + 4 = 0. Similarly, roots are x = -2 and x = -2. So, both equations have exactly one integer solution each, which is -2. So, (4, 4) is a solution. But the problem says \"at least one integer solution each,\" so this works.\n\nBut the problem asks for all pairs (m, n). So, this is one solution. Are there others?\n\nWait, but perhaps there are other possibilities. Let's think again.\n\nWe considered the second equation: p * q = m and p + q = -n. Then, by substituting into the second equation, we found that p and q must both be -2, leading to m = 4 and n = 4. But maybe there are other integer pairs (p, q) such that p * q = m and p + q = -n, but m and n are natural numbers.\n\nWait, but in the second equation, we have p and q integers, p * q = m (natural), and p + q = -n (negative, since n is natural). So, p and q must be integers with opposite signs, because their product is positive, and their sum is negative. So, one is positive and the other is negative, with the positive one having a larger absolute value.\n\nSo, suppose p is positive and q is negative, such that p * q = m and p + q = -n. Then, let's denote q = -k, where k is a positive integer. Then, p * (-k) = m ⇒ p = -m/k. But p must be a positive integer, so k must divide m. Also, p + q = p - k = -n ⇒ p = -n + k. Therefore, -m/k = -n + k ⇒ m/k = n - k. Since m and n are natural numbers, k must divide m, and n > k. So, n = (m/k) + k. Since n must be a natural number, (m/k) must be an integer. Therefore, k divides m.\n\nSo, for each divisor k of m, we can set n = (m/k) + k. But then, we also need that p = -m/k and q = -k, so the roots are p and q, and they must satisfy the first equation as well: x² + m x + n = 0. So, the roots of the first equation are, say, a and b (integers), such that a + b = -m and a * b = n. But we already have p and q as roots of the second equation. So, unless p and q are also roots of the first equation, but since the first equation is quadratic, it can have at most two roots. So, unless p and q are equal, but they are different (since one is positive and one is negative). So, unless m = 0, which it can't be, since m is a natural number, the roots must be different. Therefore, unless p and q are also roots of the first equation, but since they are different (one positive, one negative), the first equation can't have both of them as roots. Therefore, unless m = 0, which it can't be, the roots p and q of the second equation are not roots of the first equation. Therefore, the only way for both equations to have integer solutions is that the roots of the second equation are also roots of the first equation. But since the first equation has two roots, and the second equation has two roots, unless all four roots are the same, but since one root is positive and one is negative, and the other equation has positive and negative roots, unless m = n, but m and n are different. So, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the only solution is m = n = 4. Let me check another possibility.\n\nSuppose that in the first equation, one root is 1 and the other is -m - 1. Then, the product is n = 1*(-m -1) = -m -1. But n must be a natural number, so -m -1 must be positive, which implies -m > 1 ⇒ m < -1, but m is a natural number, so this is impossible. Similarly, if the roots are 2 and -m -2, then n = 2*(-m -2) = -2m -4. For n to be positive, -2m -4 > 0 ⇒ -2m > 4 ⇒ m < -2, which is impossible. So, similar reasoning applies for other roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the roots are -1 and -m +1, but then their product is (-1)*(-m +1) = m -1 = n. So, n = m -1. Then, the sum of the roots is -1 + (-m +1) = -m = -m, which is consistent. So, n = m -1. Then, from the first equation, n = m -1. Then, for the second equation, we have m = p * q and n = -(p + q). So, substituting n = m -1 into the second equation: m -1 = -(p + q) ⇒ p + q = -m +1. But m = p * q, so p + q = -p * q +1. Let's rearrange: p + q + p * q =1. Let's factor: p(1 + q) + q =1. Hmm, not sure. Maybe try small values.\n\nSuppose p and q are integers. Then, p + q = -m +1 and m = p * q. So, m = p * q, and p + q = -p * q +1. Let's rearrange: p + q + p * q =1. Let's factor: p(1 + q) + q =1. Hmm, perhaps try small integer values for p and q.\n\nLet me suppose p =1. Then, 1*(1 + q) + q =1 ⇒ 1 + q + q =1 ⇒ 1 + 2q =1 ⇒ 2q=0 ⇒ q=0. But q=0 would make m = p * q =0, which is not allowed. So, p=1 is invalid.\n\np = -1. Then, -1*(1 + q) + q =1 ⇒ -1 - q + q =1 ⇒ -1 =1, which is false.\n\np=2. Then, 2*(1 + q) + q =1 ⇒ 2 + 2q + q =1 ⇒ 2 +3q=1 ⇒3q= -1 ⇒ q= -1/3. Not integer.\n\np= -2.

And we know that P(1) = 0 and P(2) = 0. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since P is a quadratic polynomial, it should have the general form: P(x) = x² + bx + c, where b and c are coefficients we need to determine. The fact that it's a second-degree unitary polynomial means the coefficient of x² is 1, which matches this form.\n\nNow, we have two roots given: x = 1 and x = 2. Wait, if a quadratic polynomial has two roots, then it can be written in its factored form as P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2). Let me check that. Expanding that, we get x² - 3x + 2. So in this case, the quadratic polynomial would be x² - 3x + 2. But let me verify if this satisfies the given conditions.\n\nLet's compute P(1): substituting x = 1 into x² - 3x + 2 gives (1) - 3*(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. That's correct. Similarly, P(2) would be (2)² - 3*(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0. Also correct. So that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no other possible polynomial. Since a quadratic polynomial is determined uniquely by two roots (assuming they are distinct), and since we have two distinct roots here, x=1 and x=2, there should be only one such polynomial. Because the quadratic is monic (leading coefficient 1), and if it had another root, say r, then the polynomial would be (x -1)(x -2)(x - r), but that would make it a cubic polynomial, which is not allowed here. So yeah, the only quadratic polynomial with roots at 1 and 2 and leading coefficient 1 is x² - 3x + 2.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's approach this algebraically. Let's suppose P(x) = x² + bx + c. Then, since P(1) = 0, substituting x=1 gives 1 + b + c = 0. Similarly, P(2) = 0 gives 4 + 2b + c = 0. So we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) 1 + b + c = 0\n\n2) 4 + 2b + c = 0\n\nLet me solve this system. Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(4 + 2b + c) - (1 + b + c) = 0 - 0\n\nSimplifies to 3 + b = 0, so b = -3.\n\nThen substitute b = -3 into equation 1: 1 + (-3) + c = 0 => -2 + c = 0 => c = 2.\n\nSo the polynomial is x² - 3x + 2. That's the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could use Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients. For a quadratic polynomial x² + bx + c, the sum of the roots is -b, and the product is c. Here, the roots are 1 and 2, so the sum is 1 + 2 = 3, which equals -b, so b = -3. The product is 1*2 = 2, which equals c. Therefore, the polynomial is x² - 3x + 2. Yep, same result.\n\nSo whether I approach it by factoring, solving the system, or using Vieta's, I get the same answer. Therefore, the function P is x² - 3x + 2.\n\nWait, just to make sure there's no alternative interpretation. The problem says \"quadratic unitary polynomial\", so leading coefficient 1. So no leading coefficient is different. So the answer should indeed be x² - 3x + 2. I think that's correct.So I can see that the original prompt is written in French.

Since ln(2020) is ln(2000) + ln(1.01). ln(2000) is ln(2*10^3) = ln(2) + 3*ln(10). ln(2) is about 0.6931, ln(10) is approximately 2.3026, so ln(2000) ≈ 0.6931 + 3*2.3026 ≈ 0.6931 + 6.9078 ≈ 7.6009. Then ln(1.01) is approximately 0.00995. So total ln(2020) ≈ 7.6009 + 0.00995 ≈ 7.61085. Adding γ (0.5772) gives approximately 7.61085 + 0.5772 ≈ 8.188. Wait, that's way more than 6.5. But that can't be right because the actual sum of harmonic series up to n is ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - ... and so on. Wait, maybe I confused the approximation. Let me recall: the expansion is H_n = ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ... So, using the first two terms, H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n). So for n=2020, that would be ln(2020) + 0.5772 + 1/(2*2020). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, ln(2020) ≈ 7.61085 as before. Then 1/(2*2020) is 1/4040 ≈ 0.0002475. Adding those together: 7.61085 + 0.5772 ≈ 8.18805 + 0.0002475 ≈ 8.1883. Still way over 8.1883, which is still way more than 6.5. That seems too large. But wait, maybe the approximation is not accurate for such a large n? Because the harmonic series grows very slowly. The sum up to n terms is roughly ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - ... So, even for n=2020, the sum should be around ln(2020) + 0.5772, which is around 8.188, which is way more than 6.5. But the problem states that the sum is greater than 13/2, which is 6.5. So there's a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.\n\nWait, let me check the actual value of H_n for smaller n. For example, H_1 = 1, H_2 = 1.5, H_3 ≈ 1.8333, H_4 ≈ 2.0833, H_5 ≈ 2.2833, and so on. So, as n increases, the harmonic series increases, but very slowly. For n=10, H_10 ≈ 2.928968. For n=100, it's approximately 5.1873775. For n=200, it's around 6.597. For n=2000, it's approximately 7.485. For n=2020, it's approximately 8.188, as I calculated before. So, indeed, the sum up to 2020 is approximately 8.188, which is way more than 6.5. Therefore, the statement that the sum is greater than 13/2=6.5 is trivially true. But wait, maybe the problem has a typo, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: Show that 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/2019 + 1/2020 > 13/2. So 13/2 is 6.5, and the sum up to 2020 terms is around 8.188, which is indeed greater than 6.5. So maybe the problem is straightforward? But maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the problem is to compare the sum to 13/2, but since the sum is approximately 8.188, which is greater than 6.5, the inequality holds.\n\nBut why would the problem ask to show that the sum is greater than 13/2? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I need to consider a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to compare the sum to another value, but as stated, the sum is definitely greater than 6.5.\n\nWait, but let's verify with more precise calculation. Let's compute H_2020 more accurately. Using the approximation H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ... Let's compute each term:\n\nln(2020) ≈ 7.610858256 (using calculator, let's verify this: ln(2000) is ln(2*10^3) = ln(2) + 3*ln(10) ≈ 0.6931 + 3*2.3026 ≈ 0.6931 + 6.9078 ≈ 7.6009. Then ln(2000.2) ≈ ln(2000) + ln(1.0001) ≈ 7.6009 + 0.0001 ≈ 7.6010. But actually, using a calculator, ln(2020) is approximately 7.610858. So, more accurately, ln(2020) ≈ 7.610858.\n\nThen γ ≈ 0.57721566490153286060651209008240243104215933593992...\n\nSo, H_2020 ≈ 7.610858 + 0.5772156649 ≈ 8.1880736649. Then, the next term is 1/(2*2020) ≈ 0.00024752475. Adding that gives 8.1880736649 + 0.00024752475 ≈ 8.18832118965. Then the next term is -1/(12*2020^2) ≈ -1/(12*4080400) ≈ -1/48964800 ≈ -2.04*10^-8. So subtracting that gives 8.18832118965 - 0.0000000204 ≈ 8.18832116925. So the approximation H_2020 ≈ 8.18832116925. So the sum is approximately 8.188, which is way more than 6.5. Therefore, the inequality 1 + 1/2 + ... +1/2020 > 13/2 holds.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to compare the sum to a different value? Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Wait, let's check with a smaller n. For example, n=2000, H_2000 ≈ 7.610858 + 0.5772156649 ≈ 8.1880736649. Then adding 1/(2*2000) = 0.00025, so H_2000 ≈ 8.1883236649. Then subtracting 1/(12*2000^2) ≈ 1/(12*4,000,000) ≈ 1/48,000,000 ≈ 2.0833333333*10^-8. So H_2000 ≈ 8.1883236649 - 0.0000000208 ≈ 8.1883236441. Then adding 1/(4000) ≈ 0.00025, so H_2000 ≈ 8.1883236441 + 0.00025 ≈ 8.1885736441. Then subtracting 1/(12*4000^2) ≈ 1/(12*16,000,000) ≈ 1/192,000,000 ≈ 5.2083333333*10^-9. So H_2000 ≈ 8.1885736441 - 0.0000000052 ≈ 8.1885736389. So each time we add the next term, the approximation gets better. So for n=2020, H_n ≈8.18832116925. So that's definitely more than 6.5.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the sum of the harmonic series up to 1/2020 is indeed greater than 13/2. Therefore, the inequality holds. But wait, maybe the problem wants a different approach? Let me think. Maybe using integrals to bound the sum. The integral from 1 to n of 1/x dx is ln(n), and the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k is greater than ln(n+1) + γ. Wait, no. Wait, the integral test says that the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k is less than 1 + ln(n). Wait, let me recall: for decreasing positive functions, the sum from k=2 to n of f(k) ≤ ∫_{1}^{n} f(x) dx. So sum from k=1 to n of 1/k = 1 + sum from k=2 to n of 1/k ≤ 1 + ∫_{1}^{n} 1/x dx = 1 + ln(n). Wait, but that gives an upper bound, not a lower bound. So to get a lower bound, we can use the integral from 1 to n+1 of 1/x dx ≤ sum from k=1 to n of 1/k. Because the function 1/x is decreasing, so the integral from 1 to n+1 is less than the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k. So sum from k=1 to n of 1/k ≥ ∫_{1}^{n+1} 1/x dx = ln(n+1). Therefore, H_n ≥ ln(n+1). So, H_2020 ≥ ln(2021). Let's compute ln(2021). Since ln(2000) ≈7.6009, and ln(2021) = ln(2000*(1 + 21/2000)) ≈ ln(2000) + 21/2000 ≈7.6009 + 0.0105≈7.6114. So H_2020 ≥7.6114. Which is still much larger than 6.5. So even the integral test gives a lower bound that's way larger than 6.5. Therefore, the sum is definitely greater than 13/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the sum is greater than 13/2 by using another method, like grouping terms or comparing to a geometric series. Let me think. For example, pairing terms: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2, 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 ≈0.5833, 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 ≈0.2857 + 0.1667 + 0.1429 ≈0.5953, etc. But adding these up would still give a total sum greater than 6.5. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the harmonic series diverges, so partial sums can be made arbitrarily large. But since we need only 2020 terms, the sum is definitely large. The key here is that even though each term is small, the number of terms is large enough to make the sum exceed 6.5. For example, the sum of ", "answer": "Pour démontrer la divergence de la suite harmonique, Nicole ORESME groupe les termes par paquets ayant pour effectifs les puissances de 2.\n\nAppelons \\( S \\) la somme à minorer.

So, the question is whether it's possible to buy 10, 20, or 30 canals using the boxes of 6, 9, 12, and 16. Hmm, so I need to figure out if there are combinations of these box sizes that add up to exactly 10, 20, or 30 canals. Let's start with the first one: 10 canals.\n\nFirst, let's think about the smallest box size. There's a 6-canals box. If I use that, then I need to make up the remaining 4 canals. But wait, the other boxes are 9, 12, 16. 4 isn't divisible by any of those. 4 divided by 9 is less than 1, so that doesn't work. So maybe using the 6-canals box isn't the way to go here. Let's try without using any 6-canals boxes.\n\nIf I don't use any 6-canals, then I have to make 10 canals using 9, 12, 16. The next box is 9, which is already 9, leaving 1. That's not enough. 12 is too big. 16 is even bigger. So without using the 6-canals, it seems impossible to get 10. But maybe combining with other boxes. Let's see. If I use one 9 and one 1, but there's no 1-canals. So no, that's not possible. So maybe 10 is not possible. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"buy 10 canals, 20 canals, 30 canals.\" So maybe there are combinations with multiple boxes. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe using two 5-canals boxes? But there are no 5-canals boxes. The options are 6, 9, 12, 16. So no. So the only boxes are those. So for 10, the possible combinations would be using one 6 and then trying to make up 4, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe using two 5s? No. So perhaps 10 is impossible. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"buy 10 canals, 20 canals, 30 canals\". So maybe the question is whether you can buy exactly those numbers using combinations of boxes. So for 10, can we have 6 + 4? No. 9 + 1? No. 12 - 2? No. 16 -6? No. So maybe 10 is impossible. Let me check online or think differently. Wait, maybe using 6 and 9. 6 + 9 is 15, which is more than 10. So no. So 10 seems impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem allows using boxes more than once? Like, multiple boxes of the same size. For example, 6+6=12. But that's 12. So for 10, maybe 6 + 9 =15, which is over. So no. So 10 can't be formed. Let me check another way. Let's see all possible combinations:\n\nPossible combinations of boxes:\n\n- All 16s: 16 is more than 10, so no.\n\n- 12 and 16: 12 + 16=28, but we need 10. So no.\n\n- 9 and 16: 9+16=25, nope.\n\n- 9 and 12: 9+12=21, no.\n\n- 9 and 6: 9+6=15, no.\n\n- 12 and 6: same as above.\n\n- 16 and 6: same.\n\nSo all possible combinations sum to 15, 21, 12, 25, etc. None of these are 10. So 10 is impossible. Wait, but maybe using three boxes? 6+6+6=18, which is over. 6+6+9=21, etc. So no. So 10 is impossible. So the answer for 10 is no.\n\nWait, but maybe using negative numbers? But no, you can't buy a negative number of boxes. So 10 is impossible.\n\nNow 20 canals. Let's check. Again, starting with the smallest box, 6. Let's see if we can make 20 using combinations of 6,9,12,16.\n\nOne approach is to use a BFS (breadth-first search) approach, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try to find possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let's see if 20 can be made with one box. The options are 6,9,12,16. 20 isn't any of those. So no single box.\n\nNow two boxes: let's see possible pairs.\n\n6+6=12, which is less than 20.\n\n6+9=15, 6+12=18, 6+16=22 (over).\n\n9+9=18, 9+12=21, 9+16=25.\n\n12+12=24, 12+16=28.\n\n16+16=32. So none of the two-box combinations reach 20. So two boxes.\n\nNow three boxes. Let's see:\n\n6+6+6=18, 6+6+9=21, 6+6+12=24, 6+6+16=30, etc.\n\n9+9+6=24, 9+9+9=27, etc.\n\n12+12+6=30, etc.\n\nHmm. Let's try combinations with higher numbers. For example, 16. Let's see 16+4. But 4 can't be made. 16+ something else. 16+6=22, which is over. 16+9=25, over. 16+12=28, over. 16+16=32. So 16 alone is over.\n\nSo maybe 12+6+2=20. But 2 can't be made. 12+9=21, over. 9+6+5=20, but 5 can't be made. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using three boxes:\n\nLet's try 16+9+6=31, which is over. 16+12=28, 16+12+6=34. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 12+12+6=30, which is over. 12+9+9=30. That's over. 12+9+6=27, under. 12+6+6=24, under. 16+6+6=28, over. 16+9+6=31. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 16+4. But 4 can't be made. Alternatively, 12+8. 8 can't be made. 9+11. 11 can't be made. 6+14. 14 can be made with 9+5, but 5 isn't possible. Wait, 14=6+8, but 8 isn't a box size. So maybe 14=12+2, but 2 isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe using three boxes: 9+6+5, but again, 5 isn't possible. Alternatively, 12+6+2. No.\n\nWait, maybe 16+9=25, which is over. 12+9=21, over. 6+12=18, over. 9+6+6=21. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 12+9+6=27. Subtract from 20: 27-20=7. Not helpful. Maybe 12+9+6-7, but we can't subtract. So not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps three boxes: 6+6+12=24. 24-20=4, which isn't possible. 6+12+9=27. 27-20=7, not possible.\n\nWait, maybe four boxes. Let's see: 6+6+6+6=24. 24-20=4. Not possible. 6+6+6+9=31, over.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Let's check if 20 can be written as a combination of 6,9,12,16.\n\nLet me try to subtract 6 from 20: 20-6=14. Now, can 14 be made? Let's see. 14-6=8. 8 isn't possible. 14-9=5. 5 not possible. 14-12=2. No. 14-16=-2. No. So no.\n\nIf I subtract 9 from 20: 20-9=11. Can 11 be made? 11-6=5. No. 11-9=2. No. 11-12=-1. No. 11-16=-5. No.\n\nSubtract 12 from 20: 20-12=8. Can 8 be made? 8-6=2. No. 8-9=-1. No. 8-12=-4. No. 8-16=-8. No.\n\nSubtract 16 from 20: 20-16=4. 4 isn't possible.\n\nSo none of these subtractions lead to a possible combination. Maybe two boxes:\n\nWait, 6+9=15, 6+12=18, 6+16=22, 9+9=18, 9+12=21, 9+16=25, 12+12=24, 12+16=28, 16+16=32. None of these are 20. So two boxes don't work.\n\nThree boxes: Let's see. Let's try 6+6+9=21. 21-20=1. No. 6+6+12=24. 24-20=4. No. 6+6+16=28. 28-20=8. No. 6+9+9=24. 24-20=4. No. 6+9+12=27. 27-20=7. No. 6+9+16=31. 31-20=11. No. 6+12+12=30. 30-20=10.

No. 12+12+16=40. 40-20=20. But 20 isn't possible. So 12+12+16=40, which is over by 20. So no.\n\nFour boxes: Let's see. For example, 6+6+6+6=24. 24-20=4. No. 6+6+6+9=27. 27-20=7. No. 6+6+6+12=30. 30-20=10. No. 6+6+6+16=34. 34-20=14. No. 6+6+9+9=30. 30-20=10. No. 6+9+9+9=33. 33-20=13. No. 6+9+9+12=36. 36-20=16. No. 9+9+9+9=36. 36-20=16. No. 9+9+9+12=39. 39-20=19. No. 9+9+9+16=43. 43-20=23. No. 9+9+12+12=42. 42-20=22. No. 9+12+12+12=45. 45-20=25. No. 12+12+12+12=48. 48-20=28. No. 16+16+16+16=64. 64-20=44. No. So four boxes also don't work.\n\nWait, maybe five boxes. Let's see. For example, 6*4 +4=28. 28-20=8. No. 6*3 + 9*1=27. 27-20=7. No. 6*2 + 12*1=24. 24-20=4. No. 6*1 + 16*1=22. 22-20=2.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is continuous on [0,1]. It starts and ends at zero, so f(0) = f(1) = 0. That's straightforward. The second condition says that for every x between 0 and 7/10, the value of f at x + 3/10 is not equal to f(x). So, if I take any x in [0, 7/10], shifting x by 3/10 doesn't give the same function value. \n\nHmm, this symmetry condition might be key here. Let me think about how this could affect the number of zeros. Since the function is zero at both ends, maybe there's something about the periodicity or the spacing between zeros that this condition imposes.\n\nLet me consider the interval [0,1]. The function starts at 0, then at some point between 0 and 7/10, it doesn't have the same value after shifting by 3/10. So, for example, if x is 0, then f(3/10) ≠ f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(3/10) must be non-zero. Similarly, if x is 7/10, then x + 3/10 would be 10/10 = 1, so f(10/10) = f(1) = 0. But since x is in [0,7/10], the maximum x we can take is 7/10, so x + 3/10 would be up to 1. However, the condition is only for x in [0,7/10], so when x is 7/10, x + 3/10 is 1, which is the endpoint. But since the condition is about x in [0,7/10], perhaps we don't have to worry about the endpoint here.\n\nWait, but the condition is for all x in [0,7/10], so x can be as close to 7/10 as possible. So, if x is 7/10 - ε for a very small ε, then x + 3/10 = 1 - ε, which is just below 1. So, f(1 - ε) ≠ f(7/10 - ε). But since f(1) is 0, maybe that gives us some relation. However, I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me try to outline a strategy. Maybe I can divide the interval [0,1] into smaller intervals where the function must have zeros, and then use the given condition to show that there are at least seven such zeros. Alternatively, maybe use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) multiple times.\n\nSince f(0) = f(1) = 0, and the function is continuous, by IVT, there's at least one zero between 0 and 1. But the problem states at least seven. So we need to find more zeros.\n\nLet me consider the interval [0, 7/10]. For any x in [0,7/10], f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x). Let's pick x = 0. Then f(3/10) ≠ f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(3/10) is not zero. Similarly, for x = 7/10 - 3/10 = 4/10, then x + 3/10 = 7/10. But x here is 4/10, which is less than 7/10, so f(7/10) ≠ f(4/10). Since f(7/10) is on the interval [7/10,1]. Wait, but f(7/10) could be zero or not. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the function on [0,7/10] and [7/10,1]. Let's split the interval [0,1] into [0,7/10] and [7/10,1]. On [0,7/10], for each x, f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x). So, starting from x=0, f(3/10) ≠ f(0)=0. Then, for x=3/10, f(3/10 + 3/10)=f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Similarly, x=6/10, then x + 3/10 = 9/10, which is in the next interval. So on [0,7/10], if we take steps of 3/10, we can cover up to 7/10. But since 7/10 is the endpoint, maybe we need to check the overlap between the intervals.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the function. Starting from 0, moving 3/10 each time. So:\n\n- Starting at x=0, f(0)=0. Then, x=3/10, f(3/10) ≠ 0. Then x=6/10, f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Then x=9/10, but 9/10 is beyond 7/10, so we don't have to consider that here. However, if we go beyond 7/10, but x is restricted to [0,7/10]. So within [0,7/10], the shifts would be 3/10, 6/10, 9/10, etc., but we only consider up to 7/10.\n\nWait, but 7/10 is 0.7, and 6/10 is 0.6, which is within the interval. So within the interval [0,7/10], for each x, f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x). So, if we start at x=0, then x=3/10 and x=6/10. For x=0, f(3/10) ≠ f(0). For x=3/10, f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Similarly, x=6/10 would require x + 3/10 = 9/10, which is outside [0,7/10], so we don't need to consider that here. Therefore, on [0,7/10], the function can't have the same value at x and x + 3/10. So, for each step of 3/10 within [0,7/10], the function value changes.\n\nSo, starting at x=0, f(3/10) ≠ 0. Then, moving to x=3/10, f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Then, moving to x=6/10, but x + 3/10 = 9/10, which is beyond 7/10, so we don't need to check that. So, on [0,7/10], there are three points: 0, 3/10, 6/10. But each time, the function value at the next point is different from the current. So, except for the endpoints, the function alternates in sign? Not necessarily, but the values themselves are different.\n\nBut how does this help with the number of zeros?\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that between each pair of these points, the function must cross zero. But since the function is continuous, if it starts at 0, goes to a non-zero value at 3/10, then comes back to zero at 6/10, but the problem is that it might not necessarily cross zero in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can partition the interval [0,1] into smaller intervals where the function must have a zero. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the function's behavior on [0,7/10] and [7/10,1] separately. Since f(7/10) could be zero or not. If f(7/10) is zero, then maybe we can use the condition on [7/10,1]. If f(7/10) ≠ 0, then perhaps f(1) = 0 and f(7/10) ≠ 0 could give us something.\n\nWait, but we know f(1) = 0. But the condition is only for x in [0,7/10]. So, if x is 7/10 - ε, then x + 3/10 is 1 - ε, which is in [0,1), but since 1 - ε is in [0,1], but the condition is only up to x in [0,7/10]. So, even if x is just less than 7/10, x + 3/10 could be just less than 1. But the condition doesn't restrict the behavior at 1. However, since f(1) = 0, maybe there's a relation there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the function's behavior on [7/10,1]. Since f(7/10) and f(1) = 0. If f(7/10) is zero, then we can apply the same reasoning as on [0,7/10]. If it's not zero, then maybe we can get a zero near 7/10.\n\nBut let's start with the interval [0,7/10]. Let's consider the points 0, 3/10, 6/10. Since f(0) = 0, f(3/10) ≠ 0, and f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Then, if we look at [0,3/10], how does the function behave? Since f(0) = 0, and f(3/10) ≠ 0, then either f(3/10) > 0 or < 0.\n\nSuppose f(3/10) > 0. Then, moving from 0 to 3/10, the function starts at 0, goes up to a positive value at 3/10, then at 6/10, it has a different value. If f(6/10) > 0, then we might have a local maximum or something. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, if f(3/10) > 0, then on [0,3/10], the function goes from 0 to f(3/10). If f(3/10) > 0, then there must be a zero crossing at 0 and 3/10? Wait, no. If f(0) = 0 and f(3/10) > 0, then the function starts at 0, rises to a positive value at 3/10, then goes back to f(6/10). If f(6/10) > 0, then maybe there's another zero between 3/10 and 6/10? Not necessarily. But if the function is continuous, if it's positive at both 3/10 and 6/10, it might cross zero somewhere in between. But without a sign change, we can't be sure. However, the condition given is about f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x) for x in [0,7/10]. So, if we look at x in [0,7/10], then f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x). So, in particular, if we take x = 3/10, then f(3/10 + 3/10) = f(6/10) ≠ f(3/10). Similarly, x = 6/10, but x + 3/10 = 9/10, which is outside [0,7/10]. So, on [0,7/10], the function alternates in some way.\n\nWait, maybe if we consider the function on [0,7/10], and since f(0) = 0, and f(3/10) ≠ 0, then if f(3/10) > 0, then there must be a zero crossing between 0 and 3/10? No, because if the function goes from 0 to a positive value, it might not cross zero again unless it dips below zero. Similarly, if f(3/10) < 0, then it might go back up to a positive value at 6/10.\n\nBut the problem is that we don't know the sign of f(3/10) or f(6/10). However, maybe by considering multiple such points, we can find enough zeros.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the entire interval [0,1]. Since f(0) = f(1) = 0, and the function is continuous, there must be at least one zero in between. But we need seven. So, maybe each of these shifts by 3/10 introduces a new zero?\n\nWait, maybe if we divide the interval [0,1] into seven intervals of length 1/7 each. Then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a zero in each interval. But the problem is that the function is constrained by the other condition. So, the standard IVT would give at least one zero per interval, but we need seven. However, the given condition might prevent that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the condition that f(x + 3/10) ≠ f(x) to show that we can't have too many zeros.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function on [0,7/10]. Let's think about how many zeros could be forced here. If we have f(0) = 0, then perhaps non-zero values at 3/10 and 6/10. Then, maybe on [0,3/10], the function must cross zero at some point? Not necessarily. But if we have f(0) = 0, f(3/10) ≠ 0, and suppose f(3/10) > 0, then if the function is continuous, there must be a zero between 0 and 3/10 if it goes from 0 up. But it's possible that it goes up and then comes back down, so there might not be a zero crossing. However, if the function is always positive in (0,3/10), then there are no zeros. But the problem says to prove there are at least seven, so maybe in this case,", "answer": "Appelons \\( g \\) la fonction définie sur \\([0,1]\\) par \\( g(x) = f\\left(x + \\frac{3}{10}\\right) - f(x) \\).
