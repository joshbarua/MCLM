The problem says these two expressions are equal, so I can set them equal to each other and try to solve for a and b. Let me write that down.\n\nGiven:\na² + b = a + b²\n\nI need to find the minimum value of this common value. Let's call this common value c. So, we have:\na² + b = c\nand\na + b² = c\n\nSince both are equal to c, I can set them equal to each other:\na² + b = a + b²\n\nRearranging terms, maybe subtract a and b² from both sides:\na² - a + b - b² = 0\n\nHmm, maybe factor this equation. Let's group terms:\n(a² - a) + (b - b²) = 0\n\nFactor out a from the first group and b from the second:\na(a - 1) + b(1 - b) = 0\n\nWait, but 1 - b is the same as -(b - 1). So maybe:\na(a - 1) - b(b - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Let me think of another approach. Maybe solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's try solving for a in terms of b from the first equation.\n\nStarting with:\na² + b = a + b²\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\na² - a + b - b² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of a. Let's write it as:\na² - a + (b - b²) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for a:\na = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(1)*(b - b²))]/2\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\nsqrt(1 - 4*(b - b²)) = sqrt(1 - 4b + 4b²)\n\nSo,\na = [1 ± sqrt(4b² - 4b + 1)]/2\n\nHmm, the expression under the square root is 4b² -4b +1. Let me check if that's a perfect square. Let's see:\n\n4b² -4b +1 = (2b -1)²\n\nYes! Because (2b -1)² = 4b² -4b +1. So the discriminant simplifies to sqrt((2b -1)²) = |2b -1|. Therefore, the expression for a becomes:\n\na = [1 ± |2b -1|]/2\n\nSo, a is equal to [1 + |2b -1|]/2 or [1 - |2b -1|]/2.\n\nBut since a and b are real numbers, the expressions under the square root must be non-negative. However, since we already considered the discriminant, we know that the solutions are valid. So, for each b, a can take one of two values depending on the sign of 2b -1.\n\nBut maybe instead of dealing with absolute values, we can consider two cases: when 2b -1 is non-negative and when it's negative.\n\nCase 1: 2b -1 ≥ 0 → b ≥ 1/2\n\nThen |2b -1| = 2b -1, so:\n\na = [1 + (2b -1)]/2 = (2b)/2 = b\n\nOr\n\na = [1 - (2b -1)]/2 = [1 -2b +1]/2 = (2 -2b)/2 = 1 - b\n\nSo in this case, a can be either b or 1 - b.\n\nCase 2: 2b -1 < 0 → b < 1/2\n\nThen |2b -1| = -(2b -1) = 1 - 2b, so:\n\na = [1 + (1 - 2b)]/2 = (2 - 2b)/2 = 1 - b\n\nOr\n\na = [1 - (1 - 2b)]/2 = (1 -1 +2b)/2 = 2b/2 = b\n\nWait, this is the same as Case 1, just swapping the roles of a and b? Wait, no. Wait, in the first case, when b ≥ 1/2, a is either b or 1 - b. In the second case, when b < 1/2, a is either 1 - b or b. So actually, regardless of which case we are in, a is either b or 1 - b.\n\nSo effectively, for any real number b, a can be either b or 1 - b. Therefore, the solutions are pairs (a, b) where a = b or a = 1 - b.\n\nTherefore, the common value c can be expressed in terms of b as:\n\nIf a = b, then substituting into c = a² + b:\n\nc = b² + b\n\nIf a = 1 - b, then substituting into c = a² + b:\n\nc = (1 - b)² + b = 1 - 2b + b² + b = 1 - b + b²\n\nWait, so both expressions are the same? Wait:\n\nWait, (1 - b)² + b = 1 - 2b + b² + b = 1 - b + b². So yes, both cases give c = b² - b +1.\n\nWait, but hold on. If a = b, then c = b² + b. If a =1 - b, then c = (1 - b)² + b = 1 - 2b + b² + b = 1 - b + b². Which is the same as b² - b +1. So both cases lead to the same expression for c. Interesting. So regardless of whether a = b or a =1 - b, the common value c is equal to b² - b +1.\n\nTherefore, the common value c is a quadratic function of b: c = b² - b +1. Therefore, to find the smallest possible value of c, we need to find the minimum of the quadratic function c(b) = b² - b +1.\n\nSince this is a quadratic function opening upwards (coefficient of b² is positive), its minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola c = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a =1, b = -1, so vertex at b = 1/(2*1) = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of c is c(1/2) = (1/2)² - (1/2) +1 = 1/4 -1/2 +1 = (1/4 - 2/4) +1 = (-1/4) +1 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the common value is 3/4.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. If c = b² -b +1, and the minimum is at b =1/2, then c = (1/2)^2 -1/2 +1 = 1/4 -1/2 +1 = 1/4 - 2/4 +4/4 = 3/4. So yes, 3/4 is the minimum.\n\nBut let me check if this is achievable. If b =1/2, then a can be either b =1/2 or 1 - b =1 -1/2=1/2. So both give a =1/2. Therefore, the pair (a, b)=(1/2,1/2) is a solution. Then c = (1/2)^2 +1/2 =1/4 +1/2=3/4, and a +b²=1/2 + (1/2)^2=1/2 +1/4=3/4. So yes, that works. Therefore, the minimum possible value is 3/4.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there are other possible solutions where a and b are not equal or 1 - b. For example, suppose a ≠ b and a ≠1 - b. But according to our earlier analysis, the only possible solutions are when a =b or a=1 -b. Is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. We started with the equation a² + b =a +b². Rearranged to a² -a +b -b²=0. Then we factored it as a(a -1) +b(1 -b)=0. Then set a(a -1) =b(b -1). So, that's the equation. Therefore, a(a -1)=b(b -1). Let me denote k =a(a -1)=b(b -1). So, for real numbers a and b, we have that a(a -1)=b(b -1). Let me consider this as a function. Let f(x)=x(x -1)=x² -x. So, we have f(a)=f(b). Therefore, either a =b or a and b are different roots of the equation f(x)=k. Since f(x)=x² -x is a quadratic function, it is not injective. Specifically, it has a minimum at x=1/2, so for each k < f(1/2)= -1/4, there are two real solutions; for k =-1/4, there is one real solution (x=1/2); and for k > -1/4, no real solutions. Wait, but in our case, f(a)=f(b)=k. So, if a ≠b, then f(a)=f(b) implies that a and b are distinct roots of f(x)=k. But since f is a quadratic, unless k is the minimum value, there are two roots. However, if k is greater than the minimum, which is -1/4, then there are two distinct roots. If k =-1/4, only one root. But in our problem, we have real numbers a and b, so k must be such that f(a)=f(b)=k has real solutions. But in our original problem, we set k= f(a)=f(b), but we also have the equations a² +b =c and a +b² =c. So, perhaps this approach is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a(a -1)=b(b -1), which can be written as a² -a =b² -b. Then, moving all terms to one side: a² -a -b² +b =0. Which can be factored as (a² -b²) - (a -b)=0. Which is (a -b)(a +b) - (a -b)=0. Factor out (a -b): (a -b)(a +b -1)=0.\n\nAh, here we go! So, (a -b)(a +b -1)=0. Therefore, either a =b, or a +b -1=0, i.e., a +b =1.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are either a =b or a +b =1. So, these are the only possible solutions. Therefore, the common value c can be expressed as either:\n\nIf a =b, then c =a² +a (from a² +b =a² +a). Alternatively, if a +b =1, then c =a² +b =a² + (1 -a) =a² -a +1. Wait, but this is the same as the previous expression. Let me check:\n\nIf a +b =1, then b=1 -a. Substituting into c =a² +b =a² +1 -a =a² -a +1, which is the same quadratic as before. So, c =a² -a +1, which is the same function as before. Therefore, the minimum occurs at a =1/2, giving c=3/4. Therefore, regardless of whether we approach it through the quadratic in b or through this factorization, we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the common value is 3/4.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Suppose a and b are not equal or sum to 1. Is there a possibility that c could be smaller? According to the factorization, the only solutions are when a =b or a +b =1. Therefore, since c is expressed as a quadratic in a and b, which only has minima at 3/4, the minimal value is indeed 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest possible value of the common value is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}}.So I can see that the original prompt is written in Czech. I can guess that the user will prefer an Czech response.

So, the problem says that on the board, we have several non-negative integers written down, and their sum is 2024. The key condition here is that except for the smallest one, every other number is a multiple of the sum of all the smaller numbers. We need to find the maximum possible number of numbers on the board.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. We have non-negative integers, not necessarily distinct, whose total sum is 2024. The numbers are arranged in some order, but the condition is that except for the smallest number, every other number is a multiple of the sum of all the smaller numbers. So, if the numbers are arranged in increasing order, the first number is the smallest, and every subsequent number after that must be divisible by the sum of all the previous numbers.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"except for the smallest one is a multiple of the sum of all the smaller numbers.\" So, the smallest number is left out of being a multiple of the sum of the smaller numbers. So, the smallest number is not considered here. Therefore, all other numbers must be multiples of the sum of all the numbers smaller than them.\n\nSo, the first number is the smallest, say \"a1\". Then a2 must be a multiple of a1, a3 must be a multiple of a1 + a2, a4 must be a multiple of a1 + a2 + a3, and so on. Each subsequent number is a multiple of the sum of all previous numbers. The total sum of all numbers is 2024.\n\nWe need to maximize the number of numbers on the board. So, to maximize the count, we need to minimize the sum of each subsequent number, because each subsequent number is a multiple of the previous sum, so if we make them as small as possible, we can fit more numbers before reaching 2024.\n\nBut the first number is a1, the smallest. Since they are non-negative, a1 can be 0. However, if a1 is 0, then all other numbers must be multiples of 0, which is any number, but 0 can only be at the beginning if we want to have as many numbers as possible. Wait, but if a1 is 0, then all other numbers must be multiples of 0, which is any number. However, we have to make sure that the total sum is 2024. But if a1 is 0, then the other numbers can be any non-negative integers, but their sum would need to be 2024. However, in this case, the first number is 0, which is the only number that's not restricted. Then, the next number a2 must be a multiple of 0, which is any non-negative integer. But if we choose the smallest possible multiple to minimize the sum, we can have a2 as 0 as well. But that would mean multiple zeros. Wait, but the problem states \"non-negative integers,\" which includes zero. However, if we have multiple zeros, then the sum is 2024. But then, if we have, say, two zeros, then the next number a3 must be a multiple of 0 + 0 = 0, so a3 can be 0, and so on. But this would allow us to have an infinite number of zeros and a single 2024. But the problem says \"non-negative integers on a board,\" but doesn't specify they have to be distinct. So, technically, we could have an infinite number of zeros and a single 2024, but the problem is asking for the maximum number of numbers on the board. However, in reality, the problem likely expects a finite number, but perhaps the answer is infinite? But the problem says \"non-negative integers,\" which can be any number, but if we have infinitely many zeros, the sum would be infinite, which contradicts the total sum being 2024. So, that's impossible. Therefore, we must have a finite number of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the first number must be positive. So, a1 > 0. Then, to maximize the number of numbers, we need to choose a1 as small as possible, which would be 1. Then, a2 must be a multiple of 1, so a2 can be 1, 2, 3, etc. But to minimize the total sum, we need to choose the smallest possible multiples. So, a2 = 1 (smallest multiple of 1). Then, a3 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 = 2. So, the smallest multiple is 2. Then a4 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. The smallest multiple is 4. Then a5 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8. Smallest multiple is 8. Then a6 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16. Smallest multiple is 16. So, this is a pattern: each term is double the previous sum. Wait, let's check:\n\na1 = 1 (sum so far: 1)\n\na2 = 1 (sum so far: 1 + 1 = 2)\n\na3 = 2 (sum so far: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n\na4 = 4 (sum so far: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8)\n\na5 = 8 (sum so far: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16)\n\na6 = 16 (sum so far: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 32)\n\na7 = 32 (sum so far: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64)\n\na8 = 64 (sum so far: 128)\n\na9 = 128 (sum so far: 256)\n\na10 = 256 (sum so far: 512)\n\na11 = 512 (sum so far: 1024)\n\na12 = 1024 (sum so far: 2048)\n\nWait, but the total sum needs to be 2024. So, if we follow this pattern, we have a1 through a11 summing to 1024, then a12 would be 1024, making the total sum 2048, which exceeds 2024. So, that's too much. Therefore, we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, if we start with a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 2, a4 = 4, a5 = 8, a6 = 16, a7 = 32, a8 = 64, a9 = 128, a10 = 256, a11 = 512, and then a12 = 1024. But that would be 11 numbers summing to 2048. But we need 2024, so we need to subtract 24 from the last number. However, the last number has to be a multiple of the previous sum. Let's see.\n\nThe previous sum before a12 is 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = Let's compute that:\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n8 + 8 = 16\n\n16 + 16 = 32\n\n32 + 32 = 64\n\n64 + 64 = 128\n\n128 + 128 = 256\n\n256 + 256 = 512\n\nSo, the total sum after a11 is 512. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's recast:\n\nWait, no, the sum after each step is cumulative. Let me track the sum step by step:\n\na1: 1 (sum = 1)\n\na2: 1 (sum = 1 + 1 = 2)\n\na3: 2 (sum = 2 + 2 = 4)\n\na4: 4 (sum = 4 + 4 = 8)\n\na5: 8 (sum = 8 + 8 = 16)\n\na6: 16 (sum = 16 + 16 = 32)\n\na7: 32 (sum = 32 + 32 = 64)\n\na8: 64 (sum = 64 + 64 = 128)\n\na9: 128 (sum = 128 + 128 = 256)\n\na10: 256 (sum = 256 + 256 = 512)\n\na11: 512 (sum = 512 + 512 = 1024)\n\nSo, after a11, the total sum is 1024. Then, a12 must be a multiple of 1024. The smallest multiple is 1024 itself. But 1024 is exactly the remaining sum (2024 - 1024 = 1000). So, if we take a12 = 1000, which is a multiple of 1024? Wait, 1000 is not a multiple of 1024. Wait, 1024 is 2^10, 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So, 1000 is not a multiple of 1024. Therefore, we can't take a12 as 1000 in this case. So, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in how we are accumulating the sum. Let's check again:\n\nAfter a1: sum = 1\n\na2: 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2\n\na3: 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4\n\na4: 4, sum = 4 + 4 = 8\n\na5: 8, sum = 8 + 8 = 16\n\na6: 16, sum = 16 + 16 = 32\n\na7: 32, sum = 32 + 32 = 64\n\na8: 64, sum = 64 + 64 = 128\n\na9: 128, sum = 128 + 128 = 256\n\na10: 256, sum = 256 + 256 = 512\n\na11: 512, sum = 512 + 512 = 1024\n\nSo, after a11, the sum is 1024. The remaining sum is 2024 - 1024 = 1000. Now, a12 must be a multiple of the previous sum, which is 1024. So, the smallest multiple is 1024. But 1024 is greater than the remaining 1000. Therefore, we cannot take a12 as 1024. Therefore, we have to take a12 as a multiple of 1024 that is less than or equal to 1000. But there is no such multiple. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, starting with a1 = 1 might not work because the remaining sum can't be achieved with the next term. So, maybe we need to start with a different a1. Let's try a1 = 2.\n\nIf a1 = 2, then a2 must be a multiple of 2. The smallest multiple is 2. Then, a3 must be a multiple of 2 + 2 = 4. The smallest multiple is 4. Then, a4 must be a multiple of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8. Smallest multiple is 8. Then a5 = 16, a6 = 32, etc. Let's compute the sum:\n\na1 = 2 (sum = 2)\n\na2 = 2 (sum = 4)\n\na3 = 4 (sum = 8)\n\na4 = 8 (sum = 16)\n\na5 = 16 (sum = 32)\n\na6 = 32 (sum = 64)\n\na7 = 64 (sum = 128)\n\na8 = 128 (sum = 256)\n\na9 = 256 (sum = 512)\n\na10 = 512 (sum = 1024)\n\na11 = 1024 (sum = 2048)\n\nAgain, after a10, the sum is 1024. Remaining sum is 2024 - 1024 = 1000. Then, a11 would need to be a multiple of 1024, but 1000 is not. So, same problem. Therefore, starting with a1 = 2 also doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a1 = 1, but then the next number can be larger. Wait, but if we take a1 = 1, then a2 must be a multiple of 1, so the smallest possible is 1. Then a3 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 = 2, so 2. Then a4 must be a multiple of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, so 4. Then a5 = 8, a6 = 16, a7 = 32, a8 = 64, a9 = 128, a10 = 256, a11 = 512. Then the sum after a11 is 1024. Then a12 must be a multiple of 1024. But 1024 is more than 1000, so we can't take it. Therefore, the problem is that after a11, the sum is 1024, and the remaining sum is 2024 - 1024 = 1000. But the next number must be a multiple of 1024, which is impossible. Therefore, we need to adjust the sequence to make the sum", "answer": "### Řešení.\n\nUkážeme, že na tabuli může být nejvýše 6 čísel.  \nOznačme čísla na tabuli postupně \\( a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n \\) a pro každé \\( k = 1, \\dots, n \\) označme \\( s_k = a_1 + \\dots + a_k \\) součet nejmenších \\( k \\) z nich.

So, we need to generate all nine-digit numbers using digits 1-9 without repetition. Then, for each pair of digits in the nine-digit number, we need to form a two-digit number and find its smallest prime divisor. The question is whether there are exactly two such pairs that result in different prime divisors, and if so, list those pairs.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem step by step. The key points are:\n\n1. Generate all nine-digit numbers with distinct digits from 1 to 9.\n2. For each number, look at all possible adjacent pairs of digits (positions 1-2, 2-3, ..., 8-9).\n3. For each pair, form a two-digit number (like 12 or 35).\n4. Find the smallest prime divisor of each two-digit number.\n5. Check how many unique prime divisors we get across all pairs in all possible nine-digit numbers. If exactly two, list them.\n\nWait, but the question says \"can we get exactly two prime divisors?\" So maybe not all nine-digit numbers will have two different prime divisors for all their adjacent pairs. So perhaps there are some numbers where all their adjacent pairs have the same smallest prime divisor, or maybe some numbers have different ones but only two distinct primes.\n\nBut the problem is asking if there are exactly two such pairs (of digits) that result in different prime divisors. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the question is whether there exists a nine-digit number with distinct digits 1-9 such that when you look at all adjacent pairs, each pair's two-digit number has the same smallest prime divisor except for two pairs which have different ones. So, for example, all pairs except two have the same prime divisor, and those two have different ones. That would mean there are only two different primes among all the smallest primes of the two-digit numbers. So the answer would be yes, there are such numbers, and we need to find all such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether among all possible nine-digit numbers with distinct digits, when considering all their adjacent pairs, there are exactly two different primes as their smallest prime divisors, and we need to list those two primes. But that would be a different interpretation.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Can you get exactly two prime divisors? If yes, find all such pairs of digits.\" So perhaps the answer is yes, there are some nine-digit numbers where all pairs except two have the same prime divisor, and those two have different ones. So the question is asking, for those numbers, which pairs (of digits) have different prime divisors. So, the answer is the pairs where the two-digit number formed by those digits has a different smallest prime divisor than the others. And we need to list those pairs.\n\nSo, for example, if in some nine-digit number, all adjacent pairs (except two) have the same smallest prime divisor, then the two pairs with different divisors are the ones we need to find.\n\nThe problem is asking whether such a number exists, and if so, list the pairs.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible smallest prime divisors for two-digit numbers. The two-digit numbers formed by digits 1-9 (distinct) can range from 12 up to 98. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. So the smallest prime divisor for a two-digit number is at least 2 (if even) or 3 (if divisible by 3), 5 (if ends with 0 or 5, but since digits are 1-9, only 5 is possible if the last digit is 5). Wait, but 5 is only divisible by 5, so if the two-digit number ends with 5, its smallest prime divisor is 5. Otherwise, if it's even, 2; if sum of digits divisible by 3, 3; else, next primes like 7, 11, etc.\n\nBut since the two-digit numbers are formed by digits 1-9 with distinct digits, the possible two-digit numbers are from 12 to 98, excluding those with repeated digits. So, the possible two-digit numbers can have:\n\n- Even numbers: 2,4,6,8 in the units place. But since digits are distinct, units digit can't be 0, so possible units digits for even numbers are 2,4,6,8. But since digits are 1-9, units digits can be 2,4,6,8. But digits can't repeat, so if the units digit is 2, the tens digit can be 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Similarly for 4,6,8.\n\n- Numbers divisible by 3: sum of digits divisible by 3.\n\n- Numbers divisible by 5: units digit is 5.\n\n- Numbers divisible by 7: less common, but possible.\n\nSo, the possible smallest prime divisors for these two-digit numbers are 2,3,5,7,11, etc. But since two-digit numbers up to 98, the primes up to 97, but the smallest primes are 2,3,5,7,11, etc.\n\nBut for two-digit numbers, the primes possible are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29, etc., up to 97. But the smallest prime divisor for each two-digit number is unique to the number. So, for example, 12's smallest prime divisor is 2; 15's is 3; 21's is 3 (since 21=3*7, so 3 is the smallest prime divisor); 25's is 5; 33's is 3; 39's is 3; 45's is 3 (since 45=5*9, so 3 is the smallest prime divisor); 51's is 3 (51=3*17); 55's is 5; 63's is 3; 69's is 3; 75's is 3; 81's is 3; 85's is 5; 91's is 7 (since 91=7*13); 93's is 3; 99's is invalid as digits must be distinct. Wait, 99 is invalid, so the numbers go up to 98.\n\nBut maybe the key is that many two-digit numbers will share the same smallest prime divisor. For example, 12 (2), 15 (3), 21 (3), 24 (2), 27 (3), etc. So, unless the pairs are arranged such that the two-digit numbers formed by different adjacent pairs in a nine-digit number all have the same smallest prime divisor, then we can have a number that doesn't contribute any pairs with different divisors.\n\nBut the question is asking if there exists such a number where exactly two pairs have different smallest prime divisors. So, in other words, in such a number, all adjacent pairs except two have the same smallest prime divisor, and the two pairs have different ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to determine whether such numbers exist, and if so, list the pairs. So the answer would be yes, and the pairs are the two pairs where the two-digit numbers have different smallest prime divisors.\n\nSo, first, let's try to find such numbers. How can we approach this?\n\nLet's think about possible two-digit numbers that have the same smallest prime divisor. For example:\n\n- All even two-digit numbers (ending with 2,4,6,8) will have 2 as a divisor, so their smallest prime divisor is 2.\n\n- All multiples of 3 (sum of digits divisible by 3) will have 3 as a divisor, except those divisible by 2 or 5, but since we're considering even multiples, maybe.\n\nWait, but the two-digit numbers can be both even and divisible by 3, like 12 (2*6=12) and 18 (2*3*3=18). Wait, 18 is even and sum of digits 9, which is divisible by 3, so 18's smallest prime divisor is 2 (since 18=2*9). So 18's smallest prime divisor is 2.\n\nSimilarly, 21 is 3*7, so smallest prime divisor is 3.\n\nSo, the two-digit numbers can have multiple divisors. But the smallest prime divisor is the one that is the smallest prime that divides the number. So, for 18, since 18 is divisible by 2, the smallest prime divisor is 2. For 21, it's 3. For 25, it's 5.\n\nSo, the key is to find two-digit numbers where the smallest prime divisor is the same for multiple numbers in a row in the nine-digit number.\n\nSo, for example, if in a nine-digit number, all adjacent pairs except two have two-digit numbers that are all even, then those two pairs would have 2 as their smallest prime divisor, and the others would have different ones. So, in this case, the answer would be yes, and the two pairs would be the ones where the two-digit numbers formed by the middle digits (positions 2-3, 3-4, etc.) are not even, so their smallest prime divisor is different.\n\nWait, but how can we have a number where all adjacent pairs except two have even numbers? That would require that the digits in the nine-digit number alternate between even and odd. For example, if the digits are E, O, E, O, E, O, E, O, E, then each adjacent pair (E-O, O-E, E-O, etc.) would be even. But since there are 9 digits, the pairs would be 8 in total. But in this case, each adjacent pair would be even, so their smallest prime divisors would all be 2. Then, the only pairs that differ would be the ones where the digits are O-E or E-O. Wait, but if the digits alternate E-O, then the pairs would be E-O (even), O-E (odd), E-O (even), O-E (odd), etc. Wait, but in a nine-digit number with alternating digits, the pairs would be (E, O), (O, E), (E, O), (O, E), (E, O), (O, E), (E, O). So that's 7 pairs. But wait, in a nine-digit number with alternating E-O, there are 8 adjacent pairs. So, in such a case, 7 pairs have even numbers, and 1 pair has an odd number. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the number is E O E O E O E O E. Then the adjacent pairs are:\n\n1-2: E-O (even)\n\n2-3: O-E (odd)\n\n3-4: E-O (even)\n\n4-5: O-E (odd)\n\n5-6: E-O (even)\n\n6-7: O-E (odd)\n\n7-8: E-O (even)\n\n8-9: O-E (odd)\n\nSo, in this case, pairs 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 are even (divisible by 2), and pairs 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9 are odd. So 4 even pairs and 4 odd pairs. But the smallest prime divisors would be 2 for the even pairs and possibly 3/5 etc. for the odd pairs. So, if in this case, the odd pairs all have different smallest prime divisors, then we would have exactly two different primes: 2 and something else. But maybe not. For example, if the odd pairs are all multiples of 3, then their smallest prime divisor is 3, so then we would have three different primes: 2 and 3. But wait, in this example, the even pairs are all even, so their smallest prime divisor is 2, and the odd pairs could have different ones. But if the odd pairs are all multiples of 3, then the smallest prime divisor is 3, so then we have two different primes: 2 and 3. So, in this case, the nine-digit number would have all adjacent pairs (except those two) with even numbers, leading to the same smallest prime divisor (2), and the two pairs with odd numbers (smallest prime divisor 3). So, in this case, there are two different primes: 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer would be yes, and the two pairs are the ones with the odd digits in the middle.\n\nBut wait, in this example, the nine-digit number is E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E, which uses all digits 1-9 exactly once. Let's check if such a number exists. For example, let's try to construct one.\n\nLet's take digits 1 (E), 2 (O), 3 (E), 4 (O), 5 (E), 6 (O), 7 (E), 8 (O), 9 (E). So the number is 123456789. But digits 1-9 are used once. Then, the adjacent pairs:\n\n12: 12 → even → smallest prime divisor 2\n\n23: 23 → prime → smallest 23\n\n34: 34 → even → 2\n\n45: 45 → divisible by 5 → smallest 5\n\n56: 56 → even → 2\n\n67: 67 → prime → 67\n\n78: 78 → even → 2\n\n89: 89 → prime → 89\n\nSo, in this case, the seven pairs have smallest prime divisors 2, 23, 2, 5, 2, 67, 2, 89. So, here, the two pairs (23,67,89) have different smallest primes. But most of the pairs are 2. So, in this case, there are multiple different primes. So, if the problem is asking for exactly two different primes, then this example doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nBut maybe there's a different nine-digit number where all adjacent pairs except two are even. Let's try to construct such a number.\n\nSuppose we have a nine-digit number where digits alternate E-O-E-O-...-E-O-E, but we need to use all digits 1-9 exactly once. Let's try:\n\nStart with 1 (E), then 2 (O), 3 (E), 4 (O), 5 (E), 6 (O), 7 (E), 8 (O), 9 (E). So the number is 123456789. But as before, adjacent pairs have different parities. But maybe if we can arrange the digits such that the odd digits are in positions where the adjacent pairs are even. Wait, but in the alternating pattern, the odd digits are in positions 2,4,6", "answer": "Here is the structured transcription of the text from the provided image:\n\n### Řešení.\n\nPředpokládejme, že existuje číslo, ze kterého opravdu můžeme získat na tabuli právě dvě prvočísla.

The problem involves several symmetries and intersections, and the key points are D and E where the reflection of the circumcircle over BC intersects the opposite sides. CD and BE intersect at a point on the circumcircle. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the circumcircle of a triangle is the unique circle passing through all three vertices. So, if we reflect the circumcircle over side BC, we get another circle. The reflection of a circle over a line is another circle with the same radius but centered at the reflection of the original center over that line. So, if the original circumcircle has center O, then the reflected circle will have center at the reflection of O over BC, let's call that O'. \n\nNow, when we reflect the circumcircle over BC, the original triangle's vertices are A, B, C, so their images after reflection would be A', B, C (since B and C are on BC, their reflections over BC are themselves). The reflected circle, let's call it k', would pass through A', B, C. Wait, but the original circumcircle passes through A, B, C, so the reflected circle k' should also pass through A', B, C. That makes sense because reflecting the center O over BC gives O', and since the original circle is centered at O, the reflected circle is centered at O' and has the same radius. Therefore, points A, B, C lie on both original and reflected circles? Wait, no. The original circle is centered at O, so points A, B, C are on it. After reflection over BC, the image of the original points would be A', B, C if they are on BC. Wait, but A is not on BC unless the triangle is degenerate, which it's not since it's acute-angled. So, points A, B, C are not on BC. Therefore, the reflected circle k' will pass through the images of A, B, C over BC. Since B and C are on BC, their images are themselves. So, the reflected circle k' passes through A', B, C, where A' is the reflection of A over BC.\n\nTherefore, the intersection points D and E of the reflected circle k' with the opposite sides. Since k' is the reflection of the circumcircle over BC, the intersection points D and E should lie on the original sides. Wait, but the problem says that D ≠ B and E ≠ C. So, D is the intersection of k' with BA (other than B), and E is the intersection with CA (other than C). So, k' intersects BA at D and AC at E. Then CD and BE intersect on the circumcircle k. \n\nI need to visualize this. Let me try to sketch the triangle ABC with its circumcircle, then reflect it over BC to get k'. The reflected circle k' will pass through A', B, C. Then, when we draw BA and CA, these lines will intersect k' again at D and E. Then, connect CD and BE; they meet at a point on the circumcircle. Interesting. So, the intersection point of CD and BE is on k, the original circumcircle. That seems like a key property.\n\nSo, maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or angles in circles. Let me note that since D is on BA and on k', then quadrilateral BA'DC' is cyclic? Wait, no. Wait, k' is the reflection of the circumcircle over BC, so points on k' are reflections of points on the original circumcircle over BC. Therefore, if D is on k', then the reflection of D over BC is on the original circumcircle. Similarly for E.\n\nBut maybe I can use power of a point or something like that. Alternatively, since CD and BE meet on the circumcircle, perhaps there is a cyclic quadrilateral involved here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using reflection properties. For example, since k' is the reflection of k over BC, then any point on k' is the reflection of a point on k over BC. Therefore, for instance, if D is on BA and on k', then the reflection of D over BC is on the original circumcircle. Let's denote the reflection of D over BC as D'. Then D' lies on the circumcircle of ABC.\n\nSimilarly, the reflection of E over BC is E', which lies on the circumcircle.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe the intersection point of CD and BE is on the circumcircle, so maybe this intersection point is D', E', or another point? Wait, if CD and BE intersect at a point on the circumcircle, say P, then P lies on k. Therefore, P is the intersection of CD and BE, and P is on k.\n\nSo, perhaps using radical axes or something? The radical axis of two circles is the set of points with equal power with respect to both circles. The circumcircle k and the reflected circle k' intersect at points A' and B (since A' is the reflection of A over BC, and B is on both circles). Wait, no. Wait, the original circumcircle k passes through A, B, C. The reflected circle k' passes through A', B, C. Therefore, the intersection points of k and k' are B and C? Wait, no. Wait, the original circumcircle passes through A, B, C, and the reflected circle passes through A', B, C. So, the two circles intersect at B and C. Wait, but the problem states that CD and BE intersect on the circumcircle. If CD is a line from C to D on k', and BE is a line from B to E on k', then their intersection is on k. But maybe the intersection is a different point? Wait, the problem says \"their intersections with the circumcircle k\". So, CD intersects k at C and another point, say P, and BE intersects k at B and another point, say Q. But the problem states that their intersections with k are on the circumcircle, so the intersection points are C and P, and B and Q. Then, CD and BE meet at a point on k, which would be the intersection of P and Q? Wait, but CD and BE are two different lines. Their intersection point is on k. So, maybe CD and BE intersect at a point on k, which is the radical axis? Wait, but radical axis is the line of points with equal power with respect to both circles. Since k and k' intersect at B and C, their radical axis is the line BC. Wait, but CD and BE are lines passing through C and B respectively. Wait, CD passes through C and D on k', so D is on BA and on k', so D is different from B. Similarly, BE passes through B and E on k', so E is different from C. So, lines CD and BE start at C and B and go to D and E on k'. Their intersection is a point on k. Let's call that point P. Then P is on both CD and BE and on k.\n\nSo, P is the intersection of CD and BE, lying on k. So, P is on the circumcircle. So, maybe we can use some cyclic quadrilateral properties here. For example, angles subtended by the same chord are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe inversion with respect to BC? Since we are reflecting over BC, inversion might map k to itself or to another circle. But inversion might complicate things. Alternatively, since the problem is about angles and reflections, maybe using angles in the original triangle and their reflections.\n\nLet me consider the original triangle ABC. Let me denote angle BAC as α. Since the triangle is acute-angled, all angles are less than 90 degrees. The circumcircle k has center O, and reflecting over BC gives k'. The reflections of A, B, C over BC are A', B, C, respectively. So, A' is the reflection of A over BC, so AA' is perpendicular to BC, and BB' = CC' = 0, so B and C are fixed.\n\nNow, D is the intersection of k' with BA (other than B). Similarly, E is the intersection of k' with CA (other than C). Then CD and BE meet at P on k.\n\nLet me try to find some relations. Since D is on BA and on k', then D lies on the reflection of the circumcircle over BC. Similarly for E.\n\nAlternatively, since k' is the reflection of k over BC, then any point on k' is the reflection of a point on k over BC. Therefore, if D is on k', then its reflection D' is on k. Similarly, E is the reflection of its image E' over BC, which is on k.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe considering the reflection of P over BC, which is P', and since P is on k, P' is also on k. Then, since D is on BA and on k', the reflection of D over BC is D', which is on k. Similarly, the reflection of E over BC is E', on k.\n\nWait, but maybe the intersection point P has some symmetric properties. Since CD and BE intersect at P on k, then reflecting P over BC gives P', which is on k as well. So, P' is on k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the radical axis theorem. The radical axis of k and k' is BC, as they intersect at B and C. Therefore, any point on BC has equal power with respect to both circles. Since P is on k and BC, then PB² - PC² = 0, but BC is the radical axis. Wait, but P is on k, so PB² = PC² because P is on the radical axis? Wait, no. Wait, the radical axis is the set of points with equal power with respect to both circles, which is BC. So, any point on BC has equal power with respect to k and k'. Therefore, for point P on BC, power with respect to k is equal to power with respect to k'. Therefore, PA * PD = PA' * PD', but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using cyclic quadrilaterals. If P is on k, then angles involving P might be equal. For example, angle PBC equals angle PAC because they subtend the same arc PC in the circumcircle. Wait, not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since CD and BE meet at P on k, then P lies on the circumcircle, so angles subtended by the same chord should be equal. For example, angle PBC equals angle PAC, as they both subtend arc PC. Wait, maybe. Let me check.\n\nIf P is on the circumcircle, then angle PBC is equal to angle PAC because both subtend arc PC. Similarly, angle PAB is equal to angle PCA. Maybe that's useful. Let me note that.\n\nAlso, since D is on BA and on k', which is the reflection of k over BC. So, D is the reflection of some point over BC. Similarly, E is the reflection of some point over BC.\n\nWait, but D is the intersection of k' with BA. Since k' is the reflection of k over BC, then BA is reflected to itself. Because reflecting BA over BC would be another line? Wait, BA is a side of the triangle. Reflecting BA over BC: the reflection of BA over BC would be a line through the reflection of B over BC, which is B itself, and the reflection of A over BC, which is A'. So, the reflection of BA over BC is the line from B to A'. Therefore, the intersection of k' with BA is point D, which is the reflection of A over BC? Wait, no. If we reflect BA over BC, we get the line from B to A', so the intersection of k' with BA is the point where the reflected line intersects BA. Since BA is from B to A, and the reflection over BC would map A to A', so the line BA' intersects BA at A (since A is on BA). Wait, no. Wait, reflection over BC maps A to A', so the line BA' goes from B to A', and since BA is from B to A, the intersection of BA' with BA is at B. But the problem states that D ≠ B, so maybe there's another intersection. Wait, but k' is the reflection of k over BC, which includes points A', B, C. The line BA is from B to A, so unless BA intersects k' again at another point. But BA is part of the original triangle. Wait, but k' is a different circle. Maybe BA intersects k' at A and another point D. Wait, but A is on k', since k' passes through A? Wait, no. Wait, k' is the reflection of k over BC. The original circumcircle passes through A, so its reflection k' passes through A? Wait, no, because reflecting a point over a line gives another point on the circle. But the original circumcircle passes through A, so reflecting A over BC gives A', which is on k'. Therefore, the line AA' is the perpendicular bisector of BC, since reflection over BC maps A to A'. Therefore, AA' is the perpendicular bisector of BC. Wait, but if AA' is the perpendicular bisector of BC, then A' lies diametrically opposite to A on the circumcircle? Wait, no. The reflection of A over BC is A', but unless AA' is a diameter, which would mean that A' is diametrically opposite to A. But in a general triangle, the reflection of A over BC is not diametrically opposite unless the triangle is equilateral. So, maybe in this case, since we are dealing with arbitrary acute-angled triangle, A' is just a point on the circumcircle.\n\nTherefore, the line BA intersects k' again at D, which is the reflection of some point over BC. Wait, maybe D is the midpoint of arc AC or something. Not sure. Alternatively, since D is on BA and on k', which is the reflection of the circumcircle over BC, then D is the reflection of some point over BC. Let me think. If we take a point on BA, say D, then its reflection D' over BC is on the original circumcircle. Since D is on k', which is the reflection of k over BC. Therefore, the reflection of D over BC is on k. Therefore, D' is on k. So, D' is on the circumcircle, so if we can relate D and D', maybe we can find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, since P is the intersection of CD and BE on k, then maybe P is the midpoint of some arc or has some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider complex numbers. Maybe placing the triangle in the complex plane could help. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet’s consider the circumcircle of triangle ABC as the unit circle in the complex plane. Let’s assign complex numbers to the points A, B, C on the unit circle. Let’s denote the reflection of BC over BC as k'. Since reflecting over BC, which is a line in the complex plane, the reflection of a point z over the line BC can be computed. However, this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's use geometric transformations. Since the problem involves reflections and intersections on the circumcircle, maybe using spiral similarities or other transformations.\n\nWait, another idea: since CD and BE intersect on the", "answer": "### Řešení (obr. 1).\n\nObraz kružnice \\( k \\) v osové souměrnosti podle přímky \\( BC \\) označíme \\( k' \\).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The variables x, y, z are real numbers, and they have to satisfy those three inequalities. The expression we need to minimize is a quadratic form in terms of x, y, z. \n\nFirst, since we're dealing with a quadratic expression and linear constraints, this seems like an optimization problem with inequality constraints. The method that comes to mind for such problems is Lagrange multipliers, but I also recall that for quadratic forms, sometimes using inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM can be useful. Let me think about how these might apply here.\n\nLet me write down the constraints again:\n\n1. \\(xy \\geq 2\\)\n2. \\(xz \\geq 3\\)\n3. \\(yz \\geq 6\\)\n\nAnd we need to minimize \\(13x^2 + 10y^2 + 5z^2\\).\n\nMaybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other using these inequalities. For instance, from the first constraint, \\(x \\geq \\frac{2}{y}\\), from the second, \\(x \\geq \\frac{3}{z}\\), and from the third, \\(y \\geq \\frac{6}{z}\\). But this might get complicated with multiple variables. Alternatively, maybe I can set up variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, since all the constraints are inequalities, perhaps I can use substitution to express variables in terms of others. Let me try to express x, y, z in terms of one variable.\n\nFrom \\(xy \\geq 2\\), let's solve for x: \\(x \\geq \\frac{2}{y}\\).\n\nFrom \\(xz \\geq 3\\), solve for x: \\(x \\geq \\frac{3}{z}\\).\n\nSo combining these two, \\(x \\geq \\max\\left(\\frac{2}{y}, \\frac{3}{z}\\right)\\).\n\nSimilarly, from \\(yz \\geq 6\\), solve for y: \\(y \\geq \\frac{6}{z}\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the first inequality, \\(x \\geq \\frac{2}{y} \\geq \\frac{2}{\\frac{6}{z}} = \\frac{2z}{6} = \\frac{z}{3}\\).\n\nSo x is at least \\(\\max\\left(\\frac{z}{3}, \\frac{3}{z}\\right)\\). Let's analyze when \\(\\frac{z}{3} \\geq \\frac{3}{z}\\). Multiplying both sides by 3z (assuming z ≠ 0), we get \\(z^2 \\geq 9\\), so \\(|z| \\geq 3\\). Therefore, if z ≥ 3 or z ≤ -3, then \\(\\frac{z}{3} \\geq \\frac{3}{z}\\), otherwise not. \n\nSimilarly, the other way around. So depending on the value of z, different lower bounds for x apply. This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the expression to be minimized as a quadratic form and use Lagrange multipliers with the constraints. Let me recall that when dealing with inequality constraints, the minimum can sometimes be achieved at the boundary of the feasible region. So, maybe I can assume that the inequalities are tight, i.e., \\(xy = 2\\), \\(xz = 3\\), and \\(yz = 6\\), since if they are not tight, the minimum might be lower. Let's check if this is possible.\n\nIf we set \\(xy = 2\\), \\(xz = 3\\), and \\(yz = 6\\), then we can solve for x, y, z.\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\n1. \\(xy = 2\\)\n2. \\(xz = 3\\)\n3. \\(yz = 6\\)\n\nWe can solve for x, y, z. Let's try to express all variables in terms of one variable.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(x = \\frac{2}{y}\\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(x = \\frac{3}{z}\\), so \\(\\frac{2}{y} = \\frac{3}{z}\\), which gives \\(2z = 3y\\) or \\(z = \\frac{3}{2}y\\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(yz = 6\\). Substituting z from above: \\(y \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}y = 6\\) → \\(\\frac{3}{2}y^2 = 6\\) → \\(y^2 = 4\\) → \\(y = 2\\) or \\(y = -2\\)\n\nSo if y = 2, then z = 3/2 * 2 = 3, and x = 2 / 2 = 1.\n\nIf y = -2, then z = 3/2 * (-2) = -3, and x = 2 / (-2) = -1.\n\nSo the solutions are (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3) and (-1, -2, -3). Let's compute the expression for these points.\n\nFirst, (1, 2, 3):\n\n\\(13(1)^2 + 10(2)^2 + 5(3)^2 = 13 + 40 + 45 = 98\\)\n\nSecond, (-1, -2, -3):\n\n\\(13(-1)^2 + 10(-2)^2 + 5(-3)^2 = 13 + 40 + 45 = 98\\)\n\nSo both points give the same value of 98. Now, the question is, is this the minimal value? Or could there be a point where the constraints are not tight, leading to a lower value?\n\nTo check this, we need to verify if the Lagrange multipliers method gives us another critical point. Let's try that.\n\nSo, we can set up the Lagrangian function:\n\n\\(L = 13x^2 + 10y^2 + 5z^2 - \\lambda_1(xy - 2) - \\lambda_2(xz - 3) - \\lambda_3(yz - 6)\\)\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them equal to zero.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n\n\\(26x - \\lambda_1 y - \\lambda_2 z = 0\\) --- (1)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y:\n\n\\(20y - \\lambda_1 x - \\lambda_3 z = 0\\) --- (2)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to z:\n\n\\(10z - \\lambda_2 x - \\lambda_3 y = 0\\) --- (3)\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\n\\(xy = 2\\) --- (4)\n\n\\(xz = 3\\) --- (5)\n\n\\(yz = 6\\) --- (6)\n\nSo now we have six equations (1)-(6). Let's see if we can solve this system.\n\nLet me write equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n1. \\(26x - \\lambda_1 y - \\lambda_2 z = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(20y - \\lambda_1 x - \\lambda_3 z = 0\\)\n\n3. \\(10z - \\lambda_2 x - \\lambda_3 y = 0\\)\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\n4. \\(xy = 2\\)\n\n5. \\(xz = 3\\)\n\n6. \\(yz = 6\\)\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can express λ1, λ2, λ3 from equations 1, 2, 3 and substitute them into the constraints.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(26x = \\lambda_1 y + \\lambda_2 z\\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(20y = \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_3 z\\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(10z = \\lambda_2 x + \\lambda_3 y\\)\n\nIf we can solve for λ1, λ2, λ3 in terms of x, y, z, then substitute into the constraints.\n\nLet me attempt to solve equations 1, 2, 3 for λ1, λ2, λ3.\n\nFrom equation 1: λ1 y = 26x - λ2 z\n\nFrom equation 2: λ3 z = 20y - λ1 x\n\nFrom equation 3: λ3 y = 10z - λ2 x\n\nThis is a system of linear equations in λ1, λ2, λ3. Let me write it in matrix form:\n\nFor equation 1: -λ1 y - λ2 z = -26x\n\nFor equation 2: -λ1 x - λ3 z = -20y\n\nFor equation 3: -λ2 x - λ3 y = -10z\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express each equation as:\n\nFrom equation 1: 26x = λ1 y + λ2 z\n\nFrom equation 2: 20y = λ1 x + λ3 z\n\nFrom equation 3: 10z = λ2 x + λ3 y\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1. 26x = λ1 y + λ2 z\n\n2. 20y = λ1 x + λ3 z\n\n3. 10z = λ2 x + λ3 y\n\nWe can try to solve for λ1, λ2, λ3. Let's see.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nλ1 y + λ2 z = 26x --- (1)\n\nEquation 2:\n\nλ1 x + λ3 z = 20y --- (2)\n\nEquation 3:\n\nλ2 x + λ3 y = 10z --- (3)\n\nLet me try to express λ1 from equation 1:\n\nλ1 = (26x - λ2 z)/y\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\n(26x - λ2 z)/y * x + λ3 z = 20y\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(26x^2 - λ2 x z)/y + λ3 z = 20y\n\nMultiply both sides by y to eliminate denominator:\n\n26x^2 - λ2 x z + λ3 z y = 20y^2 --- (4)\n\nBut from equation 6: y z = 6, so z y = 6. Substitute into equation (4):\n\n26x^2 - λ2 x z + 6 λ3 = 20y^2\n\nBut from equation 5: x z = 3, so λ2 x z = λ2 * 3. Thus:\n\n26x^2 - 3 λ2 + 6 λ3 = 20y^2 --- (4a)\n\nNow, let's look at equation 3: λ2 x + λ3 y = 10z\n\nBut from equation 6: y z = 6, so z = 6/y. Substitute into equation 3:\n\nλ2 x + λ3 (6/y) = 10*(6/y)\n\nMultiply through by y:\n\nλ2 x y + 6 λ3 = 60\n\nBut from equation 4: xy = 2, so λ2 * 2 + 6 λ3 = 60\n\nThus:\n\n2 λ2 + 6 λ3 = 60 --- (5)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: 20 y = λ1 x + λ3 z\n\nBut from equation 5: x z = 3, so z = 3/x. Substitute into equation 2:\n\n20 y = λ1 x + λ3*(3/x)\n\nBut from equation 1: 26x = λ1 y + λ2 z\n\nBut z = 6/y from equation 6. So substitute z into equation 1:\n\n26x = λ1 y + λ2*(6/y)\n\nFrom equation 1, rearranged: λ1 y = 26x - 6 λ2 / y\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n20 y = (26x - 6 λ2 / y) * x + λ3*(3/x)\n\nMultiply through:\n\n20 y = 26x^2 - 6 λ2 x / y + 3 λ3 / x\n\nBut from equation 5: x z = 3, so x = 3/z. Not sure if that helps.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think.\n\nWait, earlier when I assumed the constraints are tight, I got a value of 98. Maybe this is indeed the minimum. Let me check if there's a possibility of getting a lower value.\n\nSuppose instead of the constraints being tight, we have some slack. For example, maybe x is slightly larger than 1, y and z slightly larger than 2 and 3. Then the expression might be smaller. But since the expression is quadratic, increasing variables above the minimum might increase the value. Wait, but the coefficients for x, y, z in the expression are positive, so if we increase x, y, z, the expression would increase. Therefore, the minimum should occur at the boundary of the feasible region defined by the constraints. Hence, the minimum should occur when the inequalities are tight, i.e., when xy=2, xz=3, yz=6.\n\nTherefore, the critical point we found earlier with (1, 2, 3) and (-1, -2, -3) should be the minimum. But let's confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the method of Lagrange multipliers. Suppose we don't assume the constraints are tight. Then, the minimum might be lower, but given the positive coefficients in the quadratic form, it's unlikely. But let's check.\n\nSuppose we don't set the constraints to equality. Then, the minimum could be lower, but since the quadratic form is convex (the coefficients of x², y², z² are positive), the minimum should be found at the boundary, i.e., when the constraints are active, meaning they are equalities.

", "response": "\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. So we have two natural numbers a and b where a is greater than b. The conditions are that a + b is divisible by 9 and a - b is divisible by 11. We need to find the smallest possible value of a + b.\n\nHmm, divisibility by 9 and 11. Since 9 and 11 are coprime, their least common multiple is 99. Maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here? Let me think.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b and D = a - b. The problem states that S is divisible by 9, so S ≡ 0 mod 9, and D is divisible by 11, so D ≡ 0 mod 11. Also, since a and b are natural numbers and a > b, D is a positive multiple of 11.\n\nFrom S and D, we can solve for a and b. Let's express a and b in terms of S and D:\n\nAdding the equations S = a + b and D = a - b gives 2a = S + D => a = (S + D)/2.\n\nSubtracting the equations gives 2b = S - D => b = (S - D)/2.\n\nSince a and b must be natural numbers, both (S + D)/2 and (S - D)/2 must be integers. Therefore, S + D and S - D must both be even, which implies that S and D must have the same parity. But since S is divisible by 9 and D is divisible by 11, let's check the parity.\n\n9 is odd, so S is odd. 11 is odd, so D is odd. Therefore, S + D and S - D would both be even (since odd + odd = even and odd - odd = even). So that's okay.\n\nNow, we need the smallest S such that S is divisible by 9 and S ≡ D mod 22 (since D is divisible by 11, so D = 11k for some integer k, and S must be congruent to D mod 22 because S ≡ D mod 11 and S is divisible by 9, and since 9 and 11 are coprime, the modulus becomes LCM(9,11)=99. Wait, maybe I need to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider S ≡ 0 mod 9 and S ≡ D mod 11. But since D is 11k, then S ≡ 0 mod 11. So S must be divisible by both 9 and 11, so S must be divisible by 99. Therefore, the smallest S is 99? Wait, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf S = 99, then D must be a multiple of 11 such that when we compute a and b, they are natural numbers. Let's compute D. Since S = 99, we have:\n\na = (99 + D)/2\n\nb = (99 - D)/2\n\nBoth a and b must be natural numbers, so 99 - D must be even and positive. Since D is a multiple of 11, let's let D = 11k. Then:\n\na = (99 + 11k)/2\n\nb = (99 - 11k)/2\n\nFor a and b to be natural numbers, 99 + 11k must be even, so 11k must be odd. Since 11 is odd, k must be odd. Let's take k = 1:\n\nD = 11*1 = 11\n\nThen a = (99 + 11)/2 = 110/2 = 55\n\nb = (99 - 11)/2 = 88/2 = 44\n\nCheck if a > b: 55 > 44, yes. Then a + b = 55 + 44 = 99, which is divisible by 9 (99/9=11) and a - b = 11, which is divisible by 11. So that works. Is 99 the smallest possible S?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smaller multiple. Let's test k=1 gives S=99. Let's check if k=0 gives D=0. But D=0 would mean a = b, but the problem states a > b, so D can't be zero. So the next possible k is 1. Therefore, 99 seems to be the smallest S. But wait, maybe there's another way?\n\nAlternatively, since S must be divisible by 9 and S ≡ D mod 11, and D is a multiple of 11. So S must be congruent to 0 mod 11 as well. Therefore, S must be divisible by LCM(9,11)=99. Therefore, the smallest S is 99. So the answer to part (a) is 99.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's set up the congruences:\n\nFrom S ≡ 0 mod 9 and S ≡ 0 mod 11, so S ≡ 0 mod 99. So the smallest S is 99. Therefore, the answer is 99. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to part (b). We need to prove that both a + 10b and b + 10a are divisible by 99.\n\nGiven that S = a + b and D = a - b, both divisible by 9 and 11 respectively. So S is a multiple of 99 (as we saw in part (a)), and D is a multiple of 11.\n\nFirst, let's express a and b in terms of S and D again:\n\na = (S + D)/2\n\nb = (S - D)/2\n\nSince S = 99k for some natural number k, and D = 11m for some natural number m (since D is a multiple of 11). But since S must also be a multiple of 11 (from part (a)), then 99k = 11 * 9k, so D must be a multiple of 11. So D = 11m, and S = 11*9k. Therefore, both S and D are multiples of 11 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo let's substitute S = 11*9k and D = 11m into the expressions a + 10b and b + 10a.\n\nFirst, compute a + 10b:\n\na + 10b = [(S + D)/2] + 10*[(S - D)/2] = [ (S + D) + 10(S - D) ] / 2 = [S + D + 10S -10D]/2 = (11S -9D)/2\n\nSimilarly, compute b + 10a:\n\nb + 10a = [(S - D)/2] + 10*[(S + D)/2] = [ (S - D) + 10(S + D) ] / 2 = [S - D + 10S + 10D]/2 = (11S +9D)/2\n\nSo we have:\n\na + 10b = (11S -9D)/2\n\nb + 10a = (11S +9D)/2\n\nWe need to show that both of these are divisible by 99. Since 99 = 9*11, and 11 and 9 are coprime, we need to show that both expressions are divisible by both 9 and 11.\n\nLet's check divisibility by 11 first. Since S and D are multiples of 9 and 11 respectively, let's see:\n\nFor a + 10b:\n\n(11S -9D)/2. Let's substitute S = 99k and D =11m (but wait, D is 11m, but m can be any integer. Wait, but actually, since D is a multiple of 11, let's write D =11m where m is a natural number. But from part (a), we already established that S must be a multiple of 99, so S =99k. Therefore, substituting into the expressions:\n\na +10b = (11*99k -9*11m)/2 = (1089k -99m)/2 = 99*(11k -m)/2\n\nSimilarly, b +10a = (11*99k +9*11m)/2 = (1089k +99m)/2 = 99*(11k +m)/2\n\nTherefore, both expressions are 99 multiplied by some integer (since 11k -m and 11k +m must be integers). So 99 is a common factor, hence both a +10b and b +10a are divisible by 99. That completes part (b).\n\nWait, but let me check if 11k -m and 11k +m are integers. Since S =99k and D=11m, and m is an integer, then yes, 11k -m and 11k +m are integers. Therefore, the expressions are indeed divisible by 99. Therefore, the proof is complete.\n\nBut let me verify with numbers. Take the example from part (a) where S=99 and D=11 (k=1, m=1):\n\na +10b = (11*99 -9*11)/2 = (1089 -99)/2 = 990/2 =495. 495 divided by 99 is 5, so divisible by 99.\n\nb +10a = (11*99 +9*11)/2 = (1089 +99)/2 = 1188/2 =594. 594 divided by 99 is 6, so divisible by 99. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's take S=99*2=198 and D=11*2=22.\n\na=(198 +22)/2=220/2=110\n\nb=(198 -22)/2=176/2=88\n\na +10b=110 + 88*10=110 +880=990. 990/99=10, divisible by 99.\n\nb +10a=88 +110*10=88 +1100=1188. 1188/99=12, divisible by 99. Correct.\n\nSo the formula holds. Therefore, the proof is valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\na) \\boxed{99}\n\nb) Both \\(a + 10b\\) and \\(b + 10a\\) are divisible by 99.So I can see that the original prompt is written in English.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the checkerboard is 4x4, so there are 16 squares in total. Each square can be either black or white. Without any restrictions, the total number of colorings would be 2^16, which is 65,536. But of course, we have a restriction here. The key restriction is that in every 2x2 square that has a black square in the top-left corner, there must be an equal number of black and white squares. So, each 2x2 subgrid starting at each (i,j) where i and j are from 1 to 3 (since 4x4 grid allows for 2x2 grids starting at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)), etc., but only those 2x2 grids that have a black square in the top-left corner. Wait, actually, the problem says \"every 2x2 square that has a black square in the top-left corner\". So, for each 2x2 square, we check if the top-left corner is black. If it is, then the number of black and white squares in that 2x2 must be equal. Since a 2x2 square has 4 squares, this means that in each such 2x2 grid, there must be exactly 2 black and 2 white squares.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to coloring the 4x4 grid such that every 2x2 subgrid that includes a black square in the top-left corner (i.e., the top-left corner square of each 2x2 subgrid) has exactly two black and two white squares. Now, the first thing I need to do is figure out how these 2x2 subgrids overlap and how the coloring affects each other.\n\nLet me visualize the 4x4 grid. Let's label the rows from top to bottom as 1 to 4 and columns from left to right as 1 to 4. The 2x2 subgrids that have a black square in the top-left corner would start at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2). Wait, but each 2x2 subgrid can start at positions (i,j) where i and j go from 1 to 3. So, there are 3x3 = 9 possible 2x2 subgrids. However, the problem states that \"every 2x2 square that has a black square in the top-left corner\". So, for each of these 2x2 subgrids, if the top-left corner is black, then the subgrid must have two black and two white squares. But if the top-left corner is white, then there are no restrictions. So, the key is that for each 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j), if (i,j) is black, then the 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j) must have two black and two white squares. If (i,j) is white, then we don't care about the 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j); but wait, actually, the problem says \"every 2x2 square that has a black square in the top-left corner\". So, even if a 2x2 subgrid has a black square in the top-left corner, but that subgrid's top-left corner is black, then it must have two black and two white. So, the color of the top-left corner of the 2x2 subgrid determines whether we have a constraint on that subgrid.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: For each 2x2 subgrid, if the top-left corner is black, then the 2x2 subgrid must have two black and two white squares. If the top-left corner is white, then the 2x2 subgrid can be any colorings (since the condition is only on those subgrids where the top-left corner is black). So, the constraints are only on the 2x2 subgrids that have a black square in the top-left corner. Therefore, for each 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j), if the square (i,j) is black, then the 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j) must have two black and two white. If (i,j) is white, then the 2x2 subgrid can be anything.\n\nBut the problem is that these 2x2 subgrids overlap. For example, the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,1) includes squares (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2) includes (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). So, the overlapping parts are shared between these subgrids. Therefore, changing the color of a single square can affect multiple 2x2 subgrids. So, this is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem where overlapping constraints interact.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can model the 4x4 grid as a graph where each node represents a square, and edges represent the constraints between squares. However, since the constraints are local (each 2x2 subgrid has a constraint), perhaps a better approach is to find dependencies or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find that the coloring is determined by coloring the top-left 2x2 square, and then the rest is forced? Let's check.\n\nSuppose we start by coloring the top-left 2x2 square. Let's say we color the four squares in positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). Each of these can be black or white. However, once we color these four squares, the next 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2) is (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). The top-left corner of this subgrid is (1,2), which is part of the top-left 2x2. If (1,2) is black, then the entire 2x2 subgrid must have two black and two white. Similarly, the subgrid starting at (2,1): (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2). The top-left corner is (2,1), which is part of the top-left 2x2. If (2,1) is black, then the 2x2 subgrid must have two black and two white.\n\nBut the challenge is that these subgrids overlap. For example, the square (2,2) is part of both the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,1) and the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2). So, the color of (2,2) affects both constraints. Similarly, (1,3) is part of the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2), and (2,3) is part of the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2) and starting at (2,2). Wait, actually, the 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2) includes (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). So, (1,3) is part of that subgrid and of the subgrid starting at (2,2). Similarly, (2,3) is part of both subgrids starting at (1,2) and (2,2). So, coloring (1,3) affects two constraints, and coloring (2,3) affects two constraints as well.\n\nTherefore, the dependencies are quite complex. Maybe we can model this as a system of equations or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use induction. Suppose we can find the number of valid colorings for a 2x2 grid, then see how adding a row or column affects the count.\n\nBut a 4x4 grid is a bit more complex. Let's start with smaller grids to see if we can find a pattern.\n\nFirst, consider a 2x2 grid. The constraints here: if the top-left corner is black, then the 2x2 must have two black and two white. So, there are 2^4 = 16 possible colorings. But with the constraint that if the top-left corner is black, then the two other squares must make up one black and one white. So, if (1,1) is black, then (1,2) + (2,1) must equal 1. If (1,1) is white, then (1,2) + (2,1) can be anything. Similarly, the subgrid starting at (1,2) would be the same as the one starting at (1,1), but shifted.\n\nWait, in a 2x2 grid, there is only one 2x2 subgrid. So, the constraint is that if the top-left corner is black, then the entire 2x2 must have two black and two white. So, how many colorings are there?\n\nIf (1,1) is black: then (1,2) + (2,1) must equal 1. So, possible colorings: (1,1)=black, (1,2) can be black or white, but (1,2) and (2,1) must be one black and one white. So, if (1,1) is black, then (1,2) = 1 - (2,1). So, for each choice of (1,2) and (2,1), they must be different. So, there are 2 possibilities for (1,2) and (2,1). So, total 2 colorings where (1,1) is black.\n\nIf (1,1) is white: then there are no restrictions. So, the remaining two squares (1,2) and (2,1) can be anything. So, 2^2 = 4 colorings.\n\nTherefore, total colorings for a 2x2 grid: 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nBut wait, 2 + 4 = 6. Let's verify. For the 2x2 grid:\n\n- If (1,1) is black: then (1,2) and (2,1) must be different. So, two possibilities: (1,2)=black, (2,1)=white or (1,2)=white, (2,1)=black. So, two colorings.\n\n- If (1,1) is white: then (1,2) and (2,1) can be any combination. So, four colorings.\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to a 3x3 grid. Wait, but maybe first consider a 3x3 grid. Wait, but the original problem is 4x4. Maybe we can think recursively. But perhaps let's try to see if there's a pattern for the 4x4 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4x4 grid can be divided into overlapping 2x2 subgrids, and the constraints propagate in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the dependencies. Each 2x2 subgrid starting at (i,j) where (i,j) is black imposes a condition on the four squares. However, the overlapping squares can affect multiple constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system where each 2x2 subgrid's constraint can be independent, but due to overlaps, there are dependencies. However, since the problem is about counting colorings, perhaps the dependencies allow the constraints to be independent, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be decomposed into independent regions. For example, if the 4x4 grid can be partitioned into independent 2x2 subgrids, each of which can be colored independently, then the total number of colorings would be the product of the valid colorings for each independent region. However, in a 4x4 grid, the 2x2 subgrids overlap, so this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the 4x4 grid as a graph where each node is a square, and edges connect squares that are in the same 2x2 subgrid. Then, the constraints would imply that adjacent squares (in the same 2x2 subgrid) must satisfy certain conditions. However, this might complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider that the constraints are local to each 2x2 subgrid. So, starting from the top-left 2x2 subgrid, we can color those four squares. Then, moving to the next 2x2 subgrid to the right, the constraints there might depend on the coloring of the first two squares. Similarly, moving down, the next subgrids might depend on previous colorings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a linear recurrence or use dynamic programming.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about the 4x4 grid. Let's try to color the grid step by step, keeping track of the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the constraints are similar to a checkerboard pattern, but with a twist. If we color the top-left 2x2 square with two black and two white squares, then perhaps the rest of the grid can be determined by the constraints.\n\nWait, let's try to visualize the 4x4 grid. Let's label the rows 1 to 4 and columns 1 to 4.\n\nStart by coloring the top-left 2x2 square (positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)). Let's suppose we fix the coloring of these four squares. Then, moving to the next 2x2 subgrid starting at (1,2), which is (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). The top-left corner is (1,2). If (1,2) is black, then the entire 2x2 subgrid must have two black and two white. Since (1,2) is black, the remaining three squares (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) must include one black and one white. But (2,2) is already part of the previous 2x2 subgrid. Wait, but we already colored (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). If (1,2) is black, then among (1,3) and (2,2), we need one black and one white. Because (2,2) is part of both the previous subgrid (1,1) and the next subgrid (1,2). So, (2,2) is already colored. Therefore, if (1,2) is black, then in the next subgrid (1,", "answer": "Začneme tím, že vyplníme středový čtverec \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) požadovaným způsobem.

Kolik zrcadlitelných čísel existuje?", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many four-digit numbers, with all digits non-zero, are called zrcaditelné. The problem states that a four-digit number \\(\\overline{abcd}\\) is zrcaditelné if when you multiply some three-digit number by 9, and then concatenate the digits of that three-digit number in reverse order, you get \\(\\overline{dcba}\\). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The four-digit number is \\(\\overline{abcd}\\), where each digit a, b, c, d is non-zero. A three-digit number has digits, let's say, \\(\\overline{pqr}\\), which when multiplied by 9 gives another three-digit number \\(\\overline{stw}\\). Then, concatenating \\(\\overline{dcba}\\) is done by reversing the digits of \\(\\overline{stw}\\), which would be \\(\\overline{wts}\\). The resulting number is \\(\\overline{dcba}\\), so \\(\\overline{wts} = \\overline{dcba}\\). Therefore, \\(\\overline{stw} = \\overline{dcba}\\) reversed, which is \\(\\overline{wts}\\). Wait, maybe I need to clarify the exact transformation.\n\nWait, the problem says: concatenate the digits of the three-digit number written in reverse order. So if the three-digit number is \\(\\overline{pqr}\\), then concatenating its digits reversed would be \\(\\overline{rqp}\\). Therefore, \\(\\overline{dcba} = \\overline{rqp}\\). Therefore, \\(\\overline{abcd} = \\overline{dcba}\\), but that would mean the original number is a palindrome, which contradicts the problem's state that the four-digit number is zrcaditelné. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you take the three-digit number \\(\\overline{pqr}\\), multiply by 9, you get another three-digit number \\(\\overline{stw}\\), and then concatenate the digits of this reversed three-digit number, which would be \\(\\overline{wts}\\), and that equals \\(\\overline{dcba}\\). Therefore, \\(\\overline{dcba} = \\overline{wts}\\), so \\(\\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts}\\). Therefore, the original four-digit number \\(\\overline{abcd}\\) is equal to the reversed version of the three-digit number multiplied by 9. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me write this out algebraically.\n\nLet’s denote the three-digit number as \\( \\overline{pqr} \\), which is equal to \\( 100p + 10q + r \\). When multiplied by 9, it becomes \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} = \\overline{stw} = 100s + 10t + w \\). Then, concatenating the digits of \\(\\overline{stw}\\) in reverse order gives \\( \\overline{wts} \\), which is equal to \\( 100w + 10t + s \\). According to the problem, this concatenated number is \\( \\overline{dcba} \\), so:\n\n\\( 100w + 10t + s = \\overline{dcba} \\)\n\nBut the original four-digit number is \\( \\overline{abcd} = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\). According to the problem, \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{dcba} \\), which would mean \\( a = d \\), \\( b = c \\). Wait, that would make the four-digit number a palindrome. But the problem says these are zrcaditelné numbers, which are four-digit numbers with non-zero digits. If they have to be palindromes, then maybe that's the case? But the problem doesn't specify that they have to be palindromes, only that their digits are non-zero. So perhaps my initial interpretation is wrong.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again carefully. It says: \"a four-digit number \\(\\overline{abcd}\\) with non-zero digits is called zrcaditelné if and only if multiplying some three-digit number (written in the form of \\(\\overline{pqr}\\)) by 9 and concatenating the digits of this three-digit number written in reverse order, you obtain the number \\(\\overline{dcba}\\).\" So the key points are:\n\n1. The four-digit number \\(\\overline{abcd}\\) is formed by multiplying a three-digit number \\(\\overline{pqr}\\) by 9 and then reversing the digits of \\(\\overline{pqr}\\) and concatenating them to form \\(\\overline{dcba}\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is phrased as: \"multiply some three-digit number [written as \\(\\overline{pqr}\\)] by 9, and concatenate the digits of this three-digit number written in reverse order, obtaining the number \\(\\overline{dcba}\\).\" So the process is:\n\n- Take a three-digit number, say \\(\\overline{pqr}\\).\n\n- Multiply it by 9: \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} = \\overline{stw} \\).\n\n- Reverse the digits of \\(\\overline{pqr}\\): \\(\\overline{wts}\\).\n\n- Concatenate \\(\\overline{wts}\\) to get \\(\\overline{dcba}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\overline{dcba} = \\overline{wts}\\), which is equal to the reversed digits of \\(\\overline{pqr}\\). Therefore, \\(\\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts}\\). Therefore, the original four-digit number is the reverse of the three-digit number multiplied by 9. So, in other words, \\(\\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts}\\), and \\( \\overline{abcd} = (9 \\times \\overline{pqr})^{-1} \\), where the inverse here refers to reversing the digits of \\(\\overline{pqr}\\). Wait, maybe that's not the exact relationship.\n\nAlternatively, if we let \\( \\overline{pqr} = \\overline{pqr} \\), then \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} = \\overline{stw} \\), and then reversing the digits of \\( \\overline{pqr} \\) gives \\( \\overline{wts} \\). Then, according to the problem, \\( \\overline{dcba} = \\overline{wts} \\). Therefore, \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} \\), so \\( \\overline{abcd} = (9 \\times \\overline{pqr})^{-1} \\), where the inverse is the digit reversal. So, the original number is the reverse of the number obtained by multiplying \\( \\overline{pqr} \\) by 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is equal to the reverse of \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} \\). So, if \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} = \\overline{stw} \\), then \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} \\). So, \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is the reverse of \\( \\overline{stw} \\). Therefore, \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is a four-digit number where the first two digits are the last two digits of \\( \\overline{stw} \\), reversed. So, for example, if \\( \\overline{stw} = \\overline{wts} \\), then \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} \\). Therefore, \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is the reverse of \\( \\overline{stw} \\).\n\nTherefore, the relationship is \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} \\), and \\( \\overline{stw} = \\overline{9 \\times \\overline{pqr}} \\). So, \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} \\), which is the reverse of \\( \\overline{stw} \\), which is \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} \\). Therefore, \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{wts} = \\overline{(9 \\times \\overline{pqr})^{-1}} \\), where the inverse is the digit reversal. So, in other words, the four-digit number \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is such that it is the reverse of the digits obtained by multiplying a three-digit number by 9. Therefore, the four-digit number is the reverse of the result of multiplying a three-digit number by 9.\n\nTherefore, to find all such four-digit numbers, we need to find all three-digit numbers \\( \\overline{pqr} \\), multiply them by 9, reverse the digits of the product, and check if the reversed product is a four-digit number with non-zero digits. However, since \\( \\overline{pqr} \\) is a three-digit number, multiplying by 9 gives a number between 900 (9×100) and 8100 (9×999). But the product \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} \\) must be a three-digit number, otherwise reversing it would not result in a four-digit number. Therefore, \\( 9 \\times \\overline{pqr} \\) must be a three-digit number, meaning \\( \\overline{pqr} \\leq 111 \\), since 9×111=999. Therefore, \\( \\overline{pqr} \\) ranges from 100 to 111. So, the three-digit numbers we can use are from 100 to 111. Let's check that.\n\nWait, 9×100=900, which is three digits; 9×111=999, which is three digits. 9×112=1008, which is four digits. So, only three-digit numbers from 100 to 111, when multiplied by 9, give three-digit numbers. Therefore, the possible three-digit numbers \\( \\overline{pqr} \\) are 100, 101, 102, ..., 111. That's 12 numbers in total (from 100 to 111 inclusive). For each of these, multiplying by 9 gives a three-digit number, reversing the digits of that gives a four-digit number \\( \\overline{abcd} \\). But we need to check that all digits of \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) are non-zero.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 100 \\): \\( 9 \\times 100 = 900 \\). Reverse digits: 009 → 009, but leading zeros are not allowed, so invalid.\n2. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 101 \\): \\( 9 \\times 101 = 909 \\). Reverse: 909 → 909. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 909 \\). But digits are 9,0,9,9. The second digit is 0, which is invalid.\n3. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 102 \\): \\( 9 \\times 102 = 918 \\). Reverse: 819. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 819 \\). Digits 8,1,9,9. All non-zero. So this is valid.\n4. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 103 \\): \\( 9 \\times 103 = 927 \\). Reverse: 729. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 729 \\). All non-zero.\n5. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 104 \\): \\( 9 \\times 104 = 936 \\). Reverse: 639. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 639 \\). All non-zero.\n6. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 105 \\): \\( 9 \\times 105 = 945 \\). Reverse: 549. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 549 \\). All non-zero.\n7. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 106 \\): \\( 9 \\times 106 = 954 \\). Reverse: 459. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 459 \\). All non-zero.\n8. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 107 \\): \\( 9 \\times 107 = 963 \\). Reverse: 369. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 369 \\). All non-zero.\n9. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 108 \\): \\( 9 \\times 108 = 972 \\). Reverse: 279. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 279 \\). All non-zero.\n10. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 109 \\): \\( 9 \\times 109 = 981 \\). Reverse: 189. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 189 \\). All non-zero.\n11. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 110 \\): \\( 9 \\times 110 = 990 \\). Reverse: 099 → 099, leading zeros invalid.\n12. \\( \\overline{pqr} = 111 \\): \\( 9 \\times 111 = 999 \\). Reverse: 999 → 999. So \\( \\overline{abcd} = 999 \\). But digits are all 9s, which are non-zero. Wait, but the problem says \"four-digit numbers with non-zero digits\". Since 999 has non-zero digits, this is valid.\n\nWait, hold on. For \\( \\overline{pqr} = 111 \\), \\( 9 \\times 111 = 999 \\). Reversing the digits gives 999. So the four-digit number is 999.

The question is about creating a nine-digit number with distinct digits (1-9) and then calculating the sum of every three neighboring digits. We need to check if both sequences a) and b) can be obtained from such a number. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem clearly. We have a nine-digit number using digits 1 through 9, each exactly once. The number is written out, and then we compute the sum of every three consecutive digits. Then, we take these seven sums and arrange them in order to form a sequence. The question is whether the given sequences can be obtained through some permutation of the digits 1-9 with these properties.\n\nLet me start by analyzing sequence a) 11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22. Let's add up all the sums first. The total sum of all three-digit sums would be (11 + 15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 22). Let me compute that: 11+15=26, 26+16=42, 42+18=60, 60+19=79, 79+21=100, 100+22=122. So the total sum of the seven sums is 122.\n\nNow, each three-digit sum is formed by three distinct digits from 1 to 9, all distinct. So each sum is between 1+2+3=6 and 7+8+9=24. The total sum of all three-digit numbers from 6 to 24 should theoretically be equal to the sum of all digits 1-9 multiplied by 3, since each digit is counted three times (once in each position of the three-digit number). The sum of digits 1-9 is 45, so 45*3=135. Wait, but the total sum here is 122, which is less than 135. That seems problematic. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check again. Each three-digit sum is a combination of three distinct digits, and all digits from 1 to 9 are used. So when you sum all seven three-digit numbers, each digit is used exactly three times. So the total sum should indeed be 3*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) = 3*45=135. But the given total sum is 122, which is 13. So this suggests that such a number cannot exist, because the total sum of the seven sums would have to be 135, but here it's 122. Therefore, sequence a) is impossible. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that calculation again. The digits are 1-9, each used exactly once in the seven three-digit numbers. Each digit appears in three different positions (hundreds, tens, units) across the seven numbers. Therefore, the total sum should indeed be 3*45=135. But the given total is 122, which is 135-122=13 less. So that discrepancy indicates that such a permutation is impossible. Therefore, sequence a) cannot be obtained. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the total sum. If the digits are used exactly once in each of the seven three-digit numbers, then each digit appears exactly three times, once in each position. So the total sum would be 3*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)=3*45=135. Therefore, the sum of the seven sums should be 135. The given sum is 122, which is 13 less. Therefore, sequence a) is impossible. \n\nSo that's a key point. Now, let's check sequence b) 11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23. Let's compute the total sum here: 11+15=26, +16=42, +18=60, +19=79, +21=100, +23=123. So total sum is 123. Again, 123 vs. expected 135. The difference is 12. Hmm. So the total sum here is 123, which is still less than 135. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 11+15=26, 26+16=42, 42+18=60, 60+19=79, 79+21=100, 100+23=123. Yes, that's correct. So the total sum is 123. But again, the expected total is 135, so this also doesn't add up. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here as well. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I miscalculated the expected total. Let me recalculate 3*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). The sum of digits 1-9 is 45, so 3*45=135. So the total sum of all seven three-digit numbers should be 135. The given sequences for a) and b) have totals 122 and 123, respectively. Therefore, both sequences are impossible because their totals don't match the expected 135. \n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that the seven sums are not necessarily using each digit exactly three times. Wait, no, because each digit is part of exactly three different three-digit numbers (since it's a nine-digit number with distinct digits). Each digit appears in exactly three of the seven sums? Wait, no. Wait, the number has nine digits. Let's think: each three-digit sum includes three digits. The entire nine-digit number is split into overlapping groups of three digits each. So the first three digits form the first sum, the next three (second, third, fourth) form the second sum, and so on. So the first sum is digits 1-3, sum S1. The second sum is digits 2-4, sum S2. The third sum is digits 3-5, sum S3. The fourth sum is digits 4-6, sum S4. The fifth sum is digits 5-7, sum S5. The sixth sum is digits 6-8, sum S6. The seventh sum is digits 7-9, sum S7. Wait, but that's actually only seven sums, each overlapping by two digits. But in this case, the first sum is 1-3, the second is 2-4, etc., up to 7-9. So each digit from 2-8 is included in three sums, and digits 1 and 9 are included in two sums. For example, digit 1 is only in the first sum (1-3), digit 2 is in sums 1 (1-3) and 2 (2-4), digit 3 is in sums 1, 2, 3. Wait, no. Wait, digit 1 is only in the first sum (digits 1-3). Digit 2 is in the first sum (1-3) and the second sum (2-4). Digit 3 is in first, second, and third sums. Digit 4 is in second, third, fourth sums. Wait, maybe this approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to note that each digit appears in exactly three sums. But let me check for a nine-digit number.\n\nWait, nine digits. If we have a nine-digit number, the number of three-digit sums is seven (from positions 1-3, 2-4, ..., 7-9). So each of the nine digits is part of some number of sums. Let's count how many times each digit appears in the sums.\n\nDigit 1: Only in the first sum (positions 1-3). So appears once.\n\nDigit 2: In sums 1-3. Wait, no. Wait, the first sum is digits 1-3, so 1 is there. The second sum is 2-4, so 2 is there. The third sum is 3-5, so 3 is there. Then the fourth sum is 4-6, so 4 is there. The fifth sum is 5-7, so 5 is there. The sixth sum is 6-8, so 6 is there. The seventh sum is 7-9, so 7 is there. So digit 1 appears only once (in sum 1). Digit 2 appears in sums 1, 2, 3 (positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5). So three times. Digit 3 appears in sums 1, 2, 3, 4? Wait, no. Wait, sum 1 is 1-3, which includes 1,2,3. Sum 2 is 2-4, which includes 2,3,4. Sum 3 is 3-5, which includes 3,4,5. Sum 4 is 4-6, which includes 4,5,6. Sum 5 is 5-7, which includes 5,6,7. Sum 6 is 6-8, which includes 6,7,8. Sum 7 is 7-9, which includes 7,8,9. So digit 3 is in sums 1,2,3. So three times. Similarly, digit 4 is in sums 2,3,4. Digit 5 is in sums 3,4,5. Digit 6 is in sums 4,5,6. Digit 7 is in sums 5,6,7. Digit 8 is in sums 6,7 (positions 7-9, 6-8). So digit 8 is in sums 6 and 7. Digit 9 is only in sum 7. So digits 1 and 9 are each in one sum, digits 2,3,4,5,6,7 are each in three sums, and digits 8 is in two sums. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So this affects the total sum calculation. \n\nSo the total sum of all seven sums would be the sum of each digit multiplied by the number of times it appears. So:\n\nDigits 1 and 9: 1 time each.\n\nDigits 2,3,4,5,6,7: 3 times each.\n\nDigit 8: 2 times.\n\nSo the total sum would be:\n\n1*1 + 2*3 + 3*3 +4*3 +5*3 +6*3 +7*3 +8*2 +9*1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + (2+3+4+5+6+7)*3 + 8*2 +9.\n\nCompute the sum inside the parentheses first: 2+3=5, +4=9, +5=14, +6=20, +7=27. So 27*3=81.\n\nThen add 8*2=16, 9*1=9.\n\nSo total sum is 1 + 81 + 16 +9 = 1 + 81 = 82, 82 +16=98, 98 +9=107.\n\nWait, but according to this, the total sum of the seven sums should be 107. However, earlier when I calculated the sums for the sequences, the totals were 122 and 123. But according to this calculation, the total should be 107. So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that either my calculation is wrong, or the problem is in the way the digits are arranged.\n\nWait, this is crucial. The problem is that when I considered the sums for sequence a) and b), I assumed that the digits are arranged such that each digit is used in exactly three sums. But according to the above calculation, the total sum should be 107, but the given sequences have totals 122 and 123. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means that either the problem is impossible for both sequences, or perhaps my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, let's check the digit counts again. Wait, the problem states that the original number uses digits 1-9 exactly once. Each three-digit sum is formed by three consecutive digits. So each digit in the original number is part of three different sums, except the first and last digits. Wait, no. Wait, the original number has nine digits, so when forming the seven sums (three-digit numbers), each digit except the first and last appears in three sums. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.\n\nIn a nine-digit number, the positions are 1 to 9. The first sum is positions 1-3, the second is 2-4, ..., up to the seventh sum being 7-9. So digit 1 is in sum 1 (positions 1-3). Digit 2 is in sums 1-3. Digit 3 is in sums 1-3. Digit 4 is in sums 2-4. Digit 5 is in sums 3-4. Digit 6 is in sums 4-5. Digit 7 is in sums 5-6. Digit 8 is in sums 6-7. Digit 9 is in sum 7. So:\n\n- Digits 1 and 9 are each in one sum.\n\n- Digits 2 and 8 are each in two sums.\n\n- Digits 3,4,5,6,7 are each in three sums.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recount:\n\nDigit 1: sum 1 (positions 1-3) → 1 time.\n\nDigit 2: sums 1 (1-3), 2 (2-4), 3 (3-5) → 3 times.\n\nDigit 3: sums 1, 2, 3 → 3 times.\n\nDigit 4: sums 2,3,4 → 3 times.\n\nDigit 5: sums 3,4,5 → 3 times.\n\nDigit 6: sums 4,5,6 → 3 times.\n\nDigit 7: sums 5,6,7 → 3 times.\n\nDigit 8: sums 6,7 → 2 times.\n\nDigit 9: sum 7 → 1 time.\n\nTherefore, the total sum would be:\n\n1*1 + 2*3 + 3*3 +4*3 +5*3 +6*3 +7*3 +8*2 +9*1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1*", "answer": "**a)** Ano, vyhovuje například číslo \\( 137\\;658\\;942 \\).

Existují dvě po sobě jdoucí prvočísla, která jsou speciální?", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if there are two consecutive prime numbers that are \"special\" as defined. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the definition says a prime number \\( p \\) is special if the sum of all primes less than \\( p \\) is a multiple of \\( p \\). So, for example, if I take the first prime, which is 2, then the sum of primes less than 2 is just 0, but 0 isn't a multiple of 2, so 2 isn't special. Next prime is 3. The sum of primes less than 3 is 2. 2 divided by 3 isn't an integer, so 3 isn't special either. Then 5. Primes less than 5 are 2 and 3. Their sum is 5. 5 divided by 5 is 1, which is an integer, so 5 is special. Hmm, that's the first special prime.\n\nSo 5 is special. Now, the question is if there are two consecutive primes that are both special. Let's check the next prime after 5, which is 7. The primes less than 7 are 2, 3, 5. Their sum is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10. 10 divided by 7 is about 1.428, not an integer. So 7 isn't special. Next prime after 7 is 11. Wait, hold on. Wait, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So after 7, the next prime is 11. Let's check if 11 is special. Sum of primes less than 11: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. 17 divided by 11 is approximately 1.545, not an integer. So 11 isn't special. Then 13. Primes less than 13: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Sum is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28. 28 divided by 13 is about 2.153, still not an integer. So 13 isn't special. Then 17. Primes less than 17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13 = 41. 41 divided by 17 is about 2.411, not integer. So 17 isn't special.\n\nWait, so after 5, the next primes 7,11,13,17 aren't special. Maybe I need to check primes higher up. Let's see. Let's check 23. Primes less than 23: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. Sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19 = 77. 77 divided by 23 is about 3.347, not an integer. So 23 isn't special. Next prime after 23 is 29. Primes less than 29: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. Sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 100. 100 divided by 29 is approximately 3.448, not integer. So 29 isn't special. Hmm, this seems like a trend. The sums of primes less than primes are not multiples of the primes themselves. Maybe we need to check even larger primes. Wait, but this might take a long time. Maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the special primes are rare. We have 5 as the first one. Let's check higher primes. Let's try 53. The primes less than 53 would be all primes up to 53. Let's calculate the sum. But that's time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Wait, the sum of primes less than p is S(p). We need S(p) ≡ 0 mod p. So S(p) must be divisible by p.\n\nNow, considering that primes get larger, the sum of primes less than p grows roughly like p² / 2 (since the density of primes around p is about 1/(ln p), and the sum would be on the order of p² / ln p). But maybe we can use some properties of primes here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for a prime p, S(p) ≡ 0 mod p. Let's recall that for primes p, if p is special, then the sum of all primes less than p is divisible by p. Let's check if there's a theorem or a known result about this.\n\nI remember that the sum of primes less than p is related to the prime-counting function, but maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of harmonic series. The sum of reciprocals of primes diverges, but here we are dealing with the actual sum of primes. However, since we are summing primes less than p, which are much smaller than p, maybe the sum grows linearly with p? Wait, but the sum of primes less than p would be roughly proportional to p², since primes up to p are distributed roughly like 1/(ln p) density, so sum would be about ∫_{2}^{p} x/(ln x) dx ≈ p² / (2 ln p). So S(p) ≈ p² / (2 ln p). Then S(p) / p ≈ p / (2 ln p). For this to be an integer, we need p / (2 ln p) to be an integer. But ln p grows slowly, so for large p, p / (2 ln p) is not an integer. Hence, S(p) would not be divisible by p for large primes. Therefore, perhaps only small primes can be special.\n\nIndeed, we saw that 5 is special. Let's check if there are any other small primes. The next primes after 5 are 7, 11, 13, 17, etc., but as we saw, they aren't special. However, maybe there's another prime in between. Wait, primes are spaced irregularly, but after 5, the next primes are spaced more with gaps. So perhaps 5 is the only special prime. But the question is whether there are two consecutive special primes. If only 5 is special, then the answer would be no. But maybe there's a prime after 5 that is also special. Wait, we checked up to 29 and 53, which aren't special. Let's check primes around 100. Let's check 101. Primes less than 101 would be a lot. The sum would be huge. Let's estimate. Primes less than 101: primes up to 101. The sum would be roughly (101²)/2 ≈ 5100.5. 5100.5 divided by 101 is approximately 50.5. So 5100.5 divided by 101 is approximately 50.5, which is not an integer. So 101 isn't special. Similarly, 103. Primes less than 103: sum is even larger. But 103 is a prime, and sum of primes less than 103 would be more than double the previous sum. So the ratio S(103)/103 would be even larger. Hence, unlikely to be integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a twin prime pair where both are special. But if only 5 is special, then even if another twin prime is special, they wouldn't be consecutive. Wait, but the twin primes after 5 would be 7,13, etc., but as we saw, 7 isn't special. 13 isn't special either. So maybe only 5 is special. Therefore, the answer would be no, there are no two consecutive special primes.\n\nBut wait, let's check another angle. Maybe there's a prime p where S(p) is divisible by p. Let's see. Suppose p is such a prime. Then S(p) ≡ 0 mod p. Let's consider that S(p) is the sum of primes less than p. So S(p) = sum_{q < p} q. For p itself to be special, this sum must be divisible by p. Let's check for primes where this holds. We saw 5. Let's check 7 again. Sum is 2+3+5=10. 10 divided by 7 is not an integer. 11: sum is 2+3+5+7=17, 17/11≈1.545. 13: sum is 2+3+5+7+11=28, 28/13≈2.153. 17: sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13=41, 41/17≈2.411. 19: sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17=58, 58/19≈3.052. Wait, 58 divided by 19 is exactly 3.052? Wait, 19*3=57, so 58 is 19*3 +1. So no, not divisible. 23: sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19=77, 77/23≈3.347. Not integer. 29: sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23=100. 100/29≈3.448. Not integer. 31: sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29=129. 129/31≈4.161. Not integer. 37: sum is sum up to 37. Let's compute: up to 31 is 129, then 37. 129 + 37=166. 166/37≈4.486. Not integer. 41: sum up to 41. 166 + 41=207. 207/41≈5.024. Not integer. 43: sum up to 43. 207 + 43=250. 250/43≈5.814. Not integer. 47: sum up to 47. 250 + 47=297. 297/47≈6.319. Not integer. 53: sum up to 53. 297 + 53=350. 350/53≈6.59. Not integer. 59: sum up to 59. 350 + 59=409. 409/59≈6.948. Not integer. 61: sum up to 61. 409 + 61=470. 470/61≈7.704. Not integer. 67: sum up to 67. 470 + 67=537. 537/67≈8.014. Not integer. 71: sum up to 71. 537 + 71=608. 608/71≈8.549. Not integer. 73: sum up to 73. 608 + 73=681. 681/73≈9.328. Not integer. 79: sum up to 79. 681 + 79=760. 760/79≈9.615. Not integer. 83: sum up to 83. 760 + 83=843. 843/83≈10.15. Not integer. 89: sum up to 89. 843 + 89=932. 932/89≈10.46. Not integer. 97: sum up to 97. 932 + 97=1029. 1029/97≈10.60. Not integer. 101: sum up to 101. 1029 + 101=1130. 1130/101≈11.188. Not integer. \n\nHmm, so up to primes around 100, none of them are special. The sum divided by p is not an integer. So maybe 5 is the only special prime. Then the answer would be no, there are no two consecutive special primes. But to be thorough, maybe we should check even higher primes, but this could take a while. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical reason why no such primes exist except 5.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider properties of primes. Suppose p is an odd prime greater than 2. Then p is odd. The sum S(p) is the sum of primes less than p. Since p is an odd prime, the primes less than p can be even or odd. Except for the prime 2, all other primes are odd. So S(p) = 2 + sum of odd primes less than p. The number of odd primes less than p: primes less than p include p-1 numbers. Since p is odd, p-1 is even, so the number of primes less than p is (number of primes up to p-1). The count of primes up to p is π(p). By the prime number theorem, π(p) ≈ p / ln p. So the number of primes less than p is π(p-1) ≈ (p-1)/ln(p-1) ≈ p / ln p. Therefore, the number of odd primes less than p is π(p-1) - 1 (since 2 is the only even prime). So the sum S(p) is 2 + sum of (π(p-1) - 1) odd primes. The sum of (π(p", "answer": "Dokážeme sporem, že dvě po sobě jdoucí speciální prvočísla neexistují.  \n\nNechť \\( p_1 = 2 < p_2 = 3 < p_3 < \\dots \\) je rostoucí posloupnost všech prvočísel.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. We're dealing with subsets, and we're interested in those subsets where the sum of their elements is divisible by 3. The set we're working with is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Non-empty means we exclude the empty set. So, all subsets except the one with no elements.\n\nLet me start by recalling some basic combinatorics. The total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. Since our set has 10 elements, the total number of subsets is 2^10 = 1024. But we need to subtract 1 for the empty set, so there are 1023 non-empty subsets. But the problem isn't about counting all subsets; it's about those subsets whose sum is divisible by 3. So, I need to find the number of subsets where the sum mod 3 is 0.\n\nOne approach to problems like this is using generating functions. Let me think about that. For each element in the set, we can represent its contribution to the total sum modulo 3. For example, if an element is congruent to 0 mod 3, it contributes 0 to the sum modulo 3. If it's 1 mod 3, it contributes 1, and if it's 2 mod 3, it contributes 2. So, the generating function for each element would be:\n\nFor elements congruent to 0 mod 3: 1 + x^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 (since x^0 is 1). Wait, actually, maybe I need to think differently. Each element can either be included or not. If it's included, it adds its value to the sum. So, the generating function for each element is 1 + x^{a_i}, where a_i is the value of the element. Then, the product of these generating functions for all elements would give a polynomial where the coefficient of x^k is the number of subsets with sum k. We need the sum of the coefficients where k ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the generating function would be the product over all elements of (1 + x^{a_i}). Then, we can evaluate this product modulo x^3 - 1, since we're only interested in the coefficients modulo 3. That is, we can use the roots of unity filter to extract the coefficients where the exponent is divisible by 3.\n\nThe standard method for this is using the roots of unity. Specifically, the number of subsets with sum congruent to 0 mod 3 is (F(1) + F(ω) + F(ω^2)) / 3, where F(x) is the generating function, and ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity. However, in this case, since we're dealing with integers, we need to ensure that the generating function is evaluated at the complex roots.\n\nBut wait, actually, since the generating function is over integers, and we need the coefficients modulo 3, perhaps we can use roots of unity filter even in integers. Let me recall the formula:\n\nThe number of subsets with sum ≡ r mod 3 is (1/3) * [F(1) + ω^{-r}F(ω) + ω^{-2r}F(ω^2)].\n\nBut since we want the sum ≡ 0 mod 3, we set r = 0. Therefore, the number is (1/3)(F(1) + F(ω) + F(ω^2)).\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with integers, maybe we can use the following approach: evaluate the generating function at x = 1, x = ω, and x = ω^2, then compute the average.\n\nBut first, let's define F(x) = product_{k=0}^9 (1 + x^{k mod 3})). Wait, but actually, for each number from 0 to 9, we can compute its contribution mod 3. Let me list the numbers from 0 to 9 and their residues mod 3:\n\n0: 0 mod 3\n\n1: 1 mod 3\n\n2: 2 mod 3\n\n3: 0 mod 3\n\n4: 1 mod 3\n\n5: 2 mod 3\n\n6: 0 mod 3\n\n7: 1 mod 3\n\n8: 2 mod 3\n\n9: 0 mod 3\n\nSo, the numbers can be categorized as:\n\n- Residue 0: 0, 3, 6, 9 → 4 numbers\n\n- Residue 1: 1, 4, 7 → 3 numbers\n\n- Residue 2: 2, 5, 8 → 3 numbers\n\nWait, 0, 3, 6, 9 are the numbers congruent to 0 mod 3. There are 4 such numbers.\n\nThen, numbers congruent to 1 mod 3: 1, 4, 7 → 3 numbers.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod 3: 2, 5, 8 → 3 numbers.\n\nSo, the generating function can be written as:\n\nG(x) = (1 + x^0)^4 * (1 + x^1)^3 * (1 + x^2)^3\n\nBecause for each residue class, we have (1 + x^r)^{count}, where count is the number of elements in that residue class.\n\nSo, G(x) = (1 + 1)^4 * (1 + x)^3 * (1 + x^2)^3 = 2^4 * (1 + x)^3 * (1 + x^2)^3\n\nSimplify 2^4 = 16, so G(x) = 16*(1 + x)^3*(1 + x^2)^3\n\nNow, we need to compute the coefficient of x^k in G(x) for k ≡ 0 mod 3, and sum them up. But how do we do that?\n\nAlternatively, since we need the sum of coefficients where k ≡ 0 mod 3, we can use the roots of unity filter. Let me recall that for a generating function F(x), the sum of coefficients where the exponent is divisible by 3 is (F(1) + F(ω) + F(ω^2))/3, where ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity. But since we are working with integer coefficients, maybe we can use this formula even in integers.\n\nBut let's check. First, compute F(1). That's just the total number of subsets, which is 2^10 = 1024. Then, compute F(ω) and F(ω^2). \n\nBut ω is a complex number, so we need to compute these values. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, G(1) = 16*(1 + 1)^3*(1 + 1)^3 = 16*2^3*2^3 = 16*8*8 = 16*64 = 1024. So, F(1) = 1024.\n\nNext, compute G(ω). Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, (1 + x)^3 evaluated at x = ω is (1 + ω)^3.\n\nSecond, (1 + x^2)^3 evaluated at x = ω is (1 + ω^2)^3.\n\nSo, G(ω) = 16*(1 + ω)^3*(1 + ω^2)^3.\n\nSimilarly, G(ω^2) = 16*(1 + ω^2)^3*(1 + ω^4)^3. But ω^4 is ω^(3+1) = ω^1 = ω. So, G(ω^2) = 16*(1 + ω)^3*(1 + ω^2)^3, which is the same as G(ω). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, ω^3 = 1, so ω^4 = ω^(3+1) = ω^1 = ω. Therefore, G(ω^2) = 16*(1 + ω^2)^3*(1 + ω^4)^3 = 16*(1 + ω^2)^3*(1 + ω)^3. So, same as G(ω). Therefore, G(ω) = G(ω^2).\n\nTherefore, the sum is (F(1) + 2*F(ω)) / 3.\n\nSo, we need to compute F(ω) = 16*(1 + ω)^3*(1 + ω^2)^3.\n\nBut let's compute (1 + ω) and (1 + ω^2). Let me recall that ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity, so ω^3 = 1, and 1 + ω + ω^2 = 0. Therefore, 1 + ω = -ω^2, and 1 + ω^2 = -ω.\n\nTherefore, (1 + ω) = -ω^2 and (1 + ω^2) = -ω.\n\nTherefore, (1 + ω)^3 = (-ω^2)^3 = (-1)^3*(ω^2)^3 = -1*(ω^6) = -1*(1) = -1, since ω^3 = 1, so ω^6 = (ω^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + ω^2)^3 = (-ω)^3 = (-1)^3*ω^3 = -1*1 = -1.\n\nTherefore, (1 + ω)^3*(1 + ω^2)^3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, G(ω) = 16*1 = 16.\n\nSimilarly, G(ω^2) = 16 as well.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets with sum ≡ 0 mod 3 is (1024 + 16 + 16)/3 = (1024 + 32)/3 = 1056/3 = 352.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. So, if we have 1024 subsets total, and using the roots of unity filter, we compute (F(1) + F(ω) + F(ω^2))/3. So, substituting F(1) = 1024, F(ω) = 16, F(ω^2) = 16, so total is 1024 + 16 + 16 = 1056. Divided by 3, 1056/3 = 352. So, 352 subsets.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming. Let's model the problem as a subset sum problem where we want the number of subsets with sum divisible by 3.\n\nThe set is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Let's assign each number its residue mod 3:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0: 0, 3, 6, 9 → 4 numbers.\n\nNumbers congruent to 1: 1,4,7 → 3 numbers.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2: 2,5,8 → 3 numbers.\n\nSo, if we consider the problem in terms of generating subsets with 0s, 1s, and 2s. Each element from the 0s contributes 0, each from the 1s contributes 1, each from the 2s contributes 2. So, the total sum modulo 3 is the sum of the contributions from each residue class.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to choose a subset of the 0s (any subset), a subset of the 1s (any subset), and a subset of the 2s (any subset), such that the total sum ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a be the number of 0s chosen (from 0,3,6,9). There are 4 choices here, each contributing 0. So, choosing any subset of the 0s is 2^4 = 16 ways.\n\n- Let b be the number of 1s chosen (from 1,4,7). There are 3 choices here. Each contributes 1, so the total contribution from 1s is b*1.\n\n- Let c be the number of 2s chosen (from 2,5,8). There are 3 choices here. Each contributes 2, so the total contribution from 2s is c*2.\n\nWe need the total sum to be 0 mod 3. So, b + 2c ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (b, c) where b ∈ {0,1,2,3}, c ∈ {0,1,2}, and b + 2c ≡ 0 mod 3, multiplied by the number of ways to choose b 1s and c 2s.\n\nBut wait, the number of ways to choose b 1s is C(3, b), and the number of ways to choose c 2s is C(3, c). Therefore, the total number of subsets is sum_{b,c} [C(3, b) * C(3, c)] * [number of ways to choose 0s].\n\nBut the number of ways to choose 0s is 2^4 = 16, since we can choose any subset of the 4 zeros. Therefore, the total number is 16 * [sum_{b,c} C(3, b) * C(3, c) * δ(b + 2c mod 3 = 0)].\n\nSo, we need to compute the sum over all b and c where b is 0,1,2,3 and c is 0,1,2, of C(3, b) * C(3, c) * δ(b + 2c mod 3 = 0). Then multiply by 16.\n\nLet me compute this sum step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible values of b and c and compute b + 2c mod 3.\n\nPossible b: 0,1,2,3\n\nPossible c: 0,1,2\n\nCompute for each pair (b,c):\n\n1. b=0, c=0: 0 + 0 = 0 → 0 mod 3 → valid.

", "response": "\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Both are about finding five consecutive integers where each number divides the sum of any three of the remaining four. Hmm, interesting. I need to check both parts (i) and (ii). Let me start with part (i): the numbers are a, a, a, a, b where a ≠ b. So, there are four a's and one b. The sum of any three of the remaining four numbers would be three a's and one b. Wait, but there are five numbers in total, right? So the five numbers are a, a, a, a, b. So when we take the sum of any three of the remaining four, that means we exclude one number each time. So for example, if we exclude one a, the sum is 3a + b. If we exclude the b, the sum is 4a. So the condition is that a (the number we are considering) divides both 3a + b and 4a. But wait, the problem states that each number divides the sum of any three of the remaining four. So each of the original five numbers needs to divide the sum of the other four numbers. Wait, but there are five numbers, so each number is excluded once. So for each number, when you exclude it, the sum of the remaining four should be divisible by that number.\n\nSo for part (i), the numbers are a, a, a, a, b. So let's check each number:\n\n1. For the first a: If we exclude the first a, the remaining numbers are a, a, a, b. Their sum is 3a + b. So a must divide 3a + b. Which simplifies to 3a + b ≡ 0 mod a. Since 3a is divisible by a, this means b ≡ 0 mod a. So b must be a multiple of a.\n\n2. For the second a: Similarly, if we exclude the second a, the sum is 3a + b, so the same condition applies: b must be divisible by a.\n\n3. For the third a: Same as above.\n\n4. For the fourth a: Excluding the fourth a, the sum is 3a + b, so again, b must be divisible by a.\n\n5. For the b: If we exclude the b, the sum is 4a. So b must divide 4a. So b | 4a.\n\nSo combining the conditions: b must be a multiple of a, and b must divide 4a. So b = k*a for some integer k, and k*a divides 4a. Which implies that k divides 4. Since a is positive, k must be a positive divisor of 4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. But since a ≠ b, k cannot be 1. So k can be 2 or 4.\n\nSo possible values for k are 2 and 4. Let's check each case.\n\nCase 1: k = 2. Then b = 2a. Now, check if b divides 4a. Since 2a divides 4a (because 4a / 2a = 2, which is an integer). So that works. So in this case, b = 2a. Now, let's see if the original numbers satisfy the condition. The numbers are a, a, a, a, 2a. So when we exclude any a, the sum is 3a + 2a = 5a, which is divisible by a. When we exclude the b (which is 2a), the sum is 4a, which is divisible by 2a. So yes, both conditions are satisfied. So for example, a = 1, then the numbers are 1,1,1,1,2. Check the sums: 1 divides 3*1 + 2 = 5 (yes), and 2 divides 4*1 = 4 (yes). So this works.\n\nCase 2: k = 4. Then b = 4a. Check if b divides 4a. 4a divides 4a? Yes, because 4a / 4a = 1. So that works. So numbers are a, a, a, a, 4a. Check the sums: excluding any a gives 3a + 4a = 7a, which is divisible by a. Excluding the b gives 4a, which is divisible by 4a. So yes, that works too. For example, a = 1, numbers are 1,1,1,1,4. Sums: 1 divides 3*1 +4=7 (yes), 4 divides 4*1=4 (yes). So that works.\n\nSo for part (i), possible solutions are when b is twice a or four times a. So there are infinitely many solutions, as long as b is a multiple of a (k=2 or 4). Therefore, the answer to part (i) is yes, such numbers exist. For example, 1,1,1,1,2 or 1,1,1,1,4, etc.\n\nNow part (ii): the numbers are a, a, b, b, c with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. So there are three a's, two b's, and one c. Wait, no: the problem says it's (a, a, b, b, c) where a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. Wait, wait, the original statement says (a, a, b, b, c) with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse that again. The problem says:\n\n(ii) \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\)\n\nWait, the parentheses indicate the conditions. So the five numbers are a, a, b, b, c, and the conditions are a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\n(ii) \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\)\n\nWait, perhaps the conditions are a ≠ b, b ≠ c, c ≠ a. But the way it's written is a, a, b, b, c with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. Maybe the conditions are a ≠ b, b ≠ c, c ≠ a. But the problem states (ii) has a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. Hmm, maybe the conditions are a ≠ b, b ≠ c, c ≠ a. Wait, but the problem statement is written in Czech. Maybe in Czech, the conditions are written as \"a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a\". But that would mean a, b, c are distinct and a ≠ c. Hmm. Maybe the problem is written in Czech, and the conditions are a ≠ b, b ≠ c, c ≠ a. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \"a, a, b, b, c (a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a)\", meaning that a, b, c are all distinct and a ≠ c. But the wording is a bit unclear. Let's try to parse it.\n\nThe original problem states: (ii) \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\). The parentheses indicate the conditions. So the numbers are a, a, b, b, c, and the conditions are a ≠ b, b ≠ c, c ≠ a. So all three variables are distinct. So a, b, c are distinct. That makes sense. So the numbers are a, a, b, b, c where a, b, c are distinct. So we need to find five consecutive integers where each number divides the sum of any three of the remaining four. Wait, but the numbers are five consecutive integers, but here we have a, a, b, b, c. Wait, no, the problem says \"five consecutive integers\", so the numbers must be consecutive integers. But here, we have four a's and one b and one c. That seems conflicting because consecutive integers would be a, a+1, a+2, etc., but here we have duplicates. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Find all five consecutive integers \\( a, a, a, a, b \\) (a ≠ b) where each of these numbers divides the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers.\" Wait, no, part (ii) is a different case. Wait, no, the user has given part (i) and part (ii), and the user is asking to \"find all five consecutive integers (i) and (ii) where each of these numbers divides the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are not necessarily distinct. Wait, but in part (i), they are a, a, a, a, b. In part (ii), they are a, a, b, b, c. Wait, but the problem says \"five consecutive integers\". Hmm. That suggests that the numbers are five consecutive integers. But in part (ii), the numbers are a, a, b, b, c. That would mean that the numbers are not consecutive, unless a, b, c are consecutive integers. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Find all five consecutive integers \\( a, a, a, a, b \\) (a ≠ b) where each of these numbers divides the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers.\"\n\nWait, but in part (ii), it's written as \\( a, a, b, b, c \\) with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. So maybe part (ii) is a different case where the numbers are a, a, b, b, c, with a, b, c being distinct. But the problem says \"five consecutive integers\". That's a problem because consecutive integers would be a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, etc., but here we have duplicates. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps there's a translation issue.\n\nWait, the original problem in Czech might have a different structure. Let me try to parse it again. The problem says:\n\n(i) \\( a, a, a, a, b \\) (a ≠ b) where each number divides the sum of any three of the remaining four.\n\n(ii) \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\) where each number divides the sum of any three of the remaining four.\n\nWait, in part (ii), the conditions are a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a. So all three are distinct. But the numbers are a, a, b, b, c. So five numbers with two a's, two b's, and one c. That's conflicting with the consecutive integers part. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is written in Czech, and the conditions are different. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and part (ii) is supposed to be consecutive integers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nFind all five consecutive integers \\( a, a, a, a, b \\) (a ≠ b) where each of these numbers divides the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers.\n\nFind all five consecutive integers \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\) where each of these numbers divides the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers.\n\nWait, maybe part (ii) is supposed to be consecutive integers, but written as \\( a, a, b, b, c \\) with a, b, c being consecutive. But the problem statement says \"five consecutive integers\", which would require the numbers to be consecutive, like x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4. But the given numbers in part (ii) are a, a, b, b, c. That seems inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps there is a typo in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the numbers in part (ii) are a, a, b, b, c, which are five consecutive integers, but with duplicates. That would make sense only if a, b, c are consecutive integers and duplicates are allowed. But the problem says \"five consecutive integers\", which generally means five distinct integers. Therefore, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is supposed to be consecutive integers, but part (ii) is miswritten, and the numbers are a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4. But the user wrote part (ii) as \\( a, a, b, b, c \\). Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe part (ii) is supposed to be five consecutive integers with duplicates, but the problem says \"five consecutive integers\", which shouldn't have duplicates. Therefore, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user intended part (ii) to be consecutive integers, but wrote it as \\( a, a, b, b, c \\), which is two a's, two b's, and one c. That's not consecutive integers. So maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part (ii) is supposed to be five consecutive integers, but the numbers are a, a, b, b, c with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a, but the problem says \"five consecutive integers\". Wait, consecutive integers are a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4. So that's five numbers with each consecutive. So maybe the problem is mistyped here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended part (ii) to be a, a, b, b, c with a, b, c being consecutive, but the problem statement has a, b, c with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a, which is redundant. So perhaps the user made a mistake in writing part (ii). Or maybe the problem is intended to have five consecutive integers, and part (ii) is written as a, a, b, b, c, but in reality, it's five consecutive integers with duplicates.

The user wrote: \"(ii) \\( a, a, b, b, c \\ (a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a) \\)\".\n\nIn Czech, the conditions could be written differently. For example, if the problem was meant to say that all three variables are distinct, but the numbers are a, a, b, b, c, which would require a, b, c to be consecutive integers. But in that case, the numbers would be a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, which are consecutive. But the problem says \"five consecutive integers\", which is conflicting.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. We have a 4x4 grid, each cell contains a unique number from 1 to 16. For every row and every column, there must be one number that when raised to the 7th power is equal to the sum of the other three numbers in that row or column. So, for example, in a row with numbers a, b, c, d, there should be one of these numbers, say a, such that a^7 = b + c + d. Similarly, in a column, one number should have its 7th power equal to the sum of the other three in that column.\n\nNow, the numbers we can use are exactly the numbers from 1 to 16, each used once. So, each number appears exactly once in the grid. The challenge is to arrange them such that each row and column satisfies that particular condition.\n\nLet me start by considering the possible values for the number whose 7th power equals the sum of the other three. Since we're dealing with natural numbers from 1 to 16, the smallest possible 7th power is 1^7 = 1, and the largest is 16^7, which is a huge number. However, the sum of three distinct numbers from 1 to 16 can't exceed 16 + 15 + 14 = 45. Wait, that's not quite right. If we have three numbers, the maximum sum would be 14 + 15 + 16 = 45. But 16^7 is way larger than 45, so actually, the 7th power of a number in the grid can't be equal to the sum of three other numbers. Wait, that can't be possible. Because even the smallest 7th power, 1^7 = 1, is way smaller than the sum of three numbers from 1 to 16 (which is at least 1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that the number's 7th power is equal to the sum of the other three numbers. So, the sum of three numbers from 1 to 16. The minimum sum of three distinct numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the maximum sum is 14 + 15 + 16 = 45. So, the 7th power of a number in the grid must be between 6 and 45. Therefore, the number whose 7th power is equal to the sum must be such that n^7 is between 6 and 45.\n\nWait, let's check n=1: 1^7=1. But 1 is less than 6, so not possible. n=2: 128. That's way bigger than 45. So, actually, there's no natural number n where n^7 is between 6 and 45. Wait, that can't be right. Did I misunderstand the problem?\n\nWait, the problem says \"there exists a number in each row and each column whose 7th power is equal to the sum of the remaining three numbers.\" So, even though the sum of three numbers can be up to 45, the 7th power of a number in the grid (which is between 1 and 16) could be up to 16^7, which is way larger than 45. So, the possible 7th powers that could be equal to the sum must be such that n^7 is between 6 and 45. But as we saw, 2^7 is 128, which is way above 45, and 1^7 is 1, which is too low. Wait, that seems impossible. That would mean there are no such numbers in the grid that satisfy this condition. But the problem is asking if it's possible, so perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says \"there exists a number in each row and each column whose 7th power is equal to the sum of the remaining three numbers.\" So, for example, in a row with numbers a, b, c, d, there exists a number among them, say a, such that a^7 = b + c + d. So, even if the sum is 6, a^7 must be 6, which is impossible because a is a natural number. The smallest a is 1, so 1^7=1, which is less than 6. Then a=2: 128, which is way larger than 45. So, there's no possible a in 1 to 16 such that a^7 is between 6 and 45. Therefore, this condition is impossible to satisfy. But the problem is asking if it's possible, so maybe the answer is no. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify with some numbers. Let's take a row with numbers 1, 2, 3, and 10. The sum of the first three is 6, which is 1+2+3=6, but the fourth number is 10, so 10^7 = 10,000,000,000, which is way larger than 6. So, in this case, none of the numbers in the row satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, so for any row or column, the sum of three numbers is less than 45, but the 7th power of any number in the grid (which is 1 to 16) is at least 1^7=1 and at most 16^7, which is way larger. So, the only way a number's 7th power can equal the sum is if that sum is equal to n^7 for some n in 1 to 16. But since n^7 is always at least 1 and at most 16^7, but the sum is at most 45, the possible n^7 is between 6 and 45. Therefore, n^7 must be between 6 and 45. Let's check which numbers n in 1 to 16 have n^7 in that range.\n\nCompute 1^7=1, 2^7=128. So 128 is way above 45. So, there is no n in 1 to 16 where n^7 is between 6 and 45. Therefore, there's no such number in the grid that can satisfy the condition. Therefore, the problem is impossible, and the answer is no.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"distinct natural numbers from 1 to 16\". So, all numbers are used. The key point is that for each row and column, there must be a number whose 7th power is equal to the sum of the other three. But since no number in the grid can have its 7th power equal to the sum of three others (as sums are up to 45 and 2^7=128 is too big), it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nBut let me just check again. Suppose someone claims that maybe 16^7 is equal to the sum of three numbers. But 16^7 is 268,738,560,000, which is way larger than 45. So, that's impossible. So, indeed, there's no such number. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy the condition. Hence, the answer is no, such a table cannot exist.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of three numbers can't exceed 45. Wait, 14 + 15 + 16 is 45. So, the maximum possible sum is 45. But 2^7 is 128, which is way higher. So, indeed, there are no numbers in the grid whose 7th power can be equal to the sum of three other numbers. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is not about the sum of the three numbers, but maybe the 7th power of a number equals the sum of the three numbers. Wait, no, the problem says \"there exists a number in each row and each column whose 7th power is equal to the sum of the remaining three numbers.\" So, the number's 7th power is equal to the sum. So, for example, in a row, one number, say a, must satisfy a^7 = b + c + d.\n\nSo, since all numbers are from 1 to 16, and the sum of three numbers is up to 45, but the 7th power of any number in the grid (from 1 to 16) is either too small (a=1:1, a=2:128) or too large (a=16:16^7). Therefore, none of the numbers in the grid can satisfy this condition. Therefore, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, such a table cannot be filled as required.So I can see that the original prompt is written in Czech.

The question is asking if there's a set of ten natural numbers in arithmetic progression (AP) such that when you multiply them together, the product is divisible by 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So first, I need to understand exactly what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, the numbers are in AP. That means they form a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So the sequence looks like a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + 9d for ten terms. The product of all these ten numbers needs to be divisible by the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1. Wait, but 1 is already a factor, so maybe that's just a repetition. So the product needs to be divisible by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, repeated. So the actual divisors we need to cover are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. But since 1 is already covered, maybe the main goal is to have the product be divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"A set of ten natural numbers in arithmetic progression (AP) exists such that their product is divisible by 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\" Hmm, maybe there's a typo here. The product should probably be divisible by 9, 7, 5, 3, 7, 5, 3, 9, but written in order. But the original statement lists them as 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So the product must be divisible by each of these numbers. But since 1 is already a factor, we can ignore that. So the product must be divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. Wait, but 9 is 3 squared, so if the product has at least two 3s, then it's divisible by 9. Similarly, having a 5 and a 7 is enough for divisibility by 35. So maybe the problem is actually to have the product divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. But the wording says \"divisible by 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\". So maybe the answer is that such a set exists, and we need to prove it or provide an example.\n\nBut first, let's confirm the problem statement. The product must be divisible by each of these numbers. Since 1 is redundant, we need to check if the product is divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. So the product must have at least one 3 from the three 3s, at least one 5 from the two 5s, at least one 7 from the two 7s, and at least two 3s from the two 9s. Wait, but each 9 contributes two 3s. So in total, the product will have 2 + 2 (from the two 9s) = 4 3s. So that's more than enough. The 5 and 7 are each present once. So the product will have factors 3^4 * 5 * 7. Therefore, the product is divisible by 3^4 * 5 * 7, which is certainly divisible by 9, 5, 7, and 3. So maybe the problem is to have such a set of numbers. But the question is phrased as \"exists\", so perhaps the answer is yes, such a set exists.\n\nNow, how can we construct such a set? Let's think about arithmetic progressions. Let's recall that in an AP, the terms are a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + 9d. For the product to be divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9, we need at least two 3s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. Wait, but 9 is 3^2, so we need two 3s. So the product will have 3^(number of terms divisible by 3) + 2*(number of terms divisible by 9). Let's check.\n\nSuppose we have ten terms. Let's denote how many terms are divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. Each term is a + kd for k from 0 to 9. So the terms are a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + 9d.\n\nTo have the product divisible by 9, we need at least two 3s. So the number of terms divisible by 3 (counted with multiplicity) should be at least 2. Similarly, the number of terms divisible by 5 should be at least 1, and by 7 at least 1.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Let's try to construct such a progression.\n\nFirst, let's consider that in any AP, the terms can be even or odd, but since we need divisibility by 3, 5, 7, and 9, we need to have numbers in the AP divisible by these primes. Let's think about starting at a number that is divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. Or maybe starting at 0? Wait, but natural numbers start from 1, so a must be at least 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing a to be divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. Let's see. If a is divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9, then the first term is a multiple of 9, so the first term is 9k. Then the terms would be 9k, 9k + d, ..., 9k + 9d. Then the product would include 9k and 9k + 9d, which are multiples of 9, but also other terms. But the problem is that the other terms might not have the necessary factors. Let's check.\n\nWait, if we take a = 9, then the terms are 9, 9 + d, 9 + 2d, ..., 9 + 9d. Then in this case, the first term is 9, which is divisible by 9, and the tenth term is 9 + 9d. To have the product divisible by 9, we already have one term divisible by 9. But we need another term divisible by 9. So unless d is a multiple of 9, the terms won't be divisible by 9. So if we set d as a multiple of 9, say d = 9m, then the terms become 9 + 9m, 9 + 18m, ..., 9 + 81m. Then the product would have terms divisible by 9. But then the product would have at least two terms divisible by 9 (the first and the tenth term). So that works for divisibility by 9.\n\nBut then, we also need the product to be divisible by 5 and 7. So in the sequence 9, 9 + 9m, ..., 9 + 81m, we need at least one term divisible by 5 and at least one term divisible by 7. Since m is a positive integer, perhaps we can choose m such that one of the terms is divisible by 5 and another is divisible by 7. Let's see.\n\nLet’s suppose m is 1 for simplicity. Then the sequence is 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90. Let's check the terms:\n\n9: divisible by 9\n\n18: divisible by 9 and 2\n\n27: divisible by 9 and 3\n\n36: divisible by 9 and 4\n\n45: divisible by 9 and 5\n\n54: divisible by 9 and 6\n\n63: divisible by 9 and 7\n\n72: divisible by 9 and 8\n\n81: divisible by 9 and 9\n\n90: divisible by 9 and 10\n\nWait, but in this case, the product will include 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90. Let's check divisibility by 5 and 7.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n45 is divisible by 5, 54 is divisible by 9 and 6, but not 5. Wait, 54 is 54, which is 6*9, so 2*3^3. Not divisible by 5. 45 is divisible by 5. So that term is divisible by 5. So that's good. Similarly, 63 is divisible by 7. So 63 is divisible by 7. So in this case, the product includes 45 (divisible by 5) and 63 (divisible by 7). So the product is divisible by 5 and 7. Also, 9 is present multiple times. So the product is divisible by 9, 5, 7. But we need it to be divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, but we have 9, 5, 7, and multiple 3s. So the product is divisible by 9, 5, and 7. So that works. But the problem states that the product is divisible by all of 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So in this case, the product is divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9, which is what we need. The two 3s are covered by the multiple terms divisible by 9. So this set of ten numbers is 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90. Let's verify the product is divisible by 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nWait, but 1 is already a factor, so we can ignore that. So the actual required divisors are 3, 5, 7, 9. The product has factors 9 (multiple times), 5, and 7. So it is divisible by 9, 5, 7, and 9, which covers the required divisors. Therefore, the answer is yes, such a set exists, and an example is the sequence starting at 9 with common difference 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.\n\nBut let me check another example to make sure. Suppose we take a different starting point. Let's say a = 3, d = 3. Then the sequence is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30. Let's see divisibility:\n\nDivisible by 9: 9, 12 (no), 15 (no), 18 (yes), 21 (no), 24 (no), 27 (yes), 30 (no). So two terms divisible by 9 (9 and 27). Divisible by 5: 15. Divisible by 7: none. So this set doesn't have a term divisible by 7. Therefore, the product isn't divisible by 7. So this example fails.\n\nAnother example: a = 5, d = 5. The sequence is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. Divisible by 9: 15, 25 (no), 35 (no), 45 (yes), 50 (no). So one term divisible by 9. Not enough. Divisible by 5: all terms. Divisible by 7: 35. So one term divisible by 7. Divisible by 3: 15, 30, 45. So three terms divisible by 3. So product is divisible by 9, 5, 7, and 3. But we need to check if it's divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9. Since the product has 3^3 (from 15, 30, 45) and 5 and 7, so it's divisible by 9, 5, 7, 3. So that works. Wait, but in this case, the product is divisible by 9, 5, 7, 3, but the problem requires 9, 7, 5, 3. So both examples work. So maybe there are multiple solutions.\n\nBut the key point is that in the first example, starting at 9 with d=9, we get a set where all terms are divisible by 9, which gives us the necessary multiple 3s. Whereas the second example starts at 5 with d=5, but still covers the required factors. So either way, such a set exists.\n\nBut let's confirm with another example. Suppose we take a = 15, d = 15. Then the sequence is 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150. Let's check divisibility:\n\nDivisible by 9: 15 (no), 30 (no), 45 (yes), 60 (no), 75 (no), 90 (yes), 105 (no), 120 (no), 135 (yes), 150 (no). So three terms divisible by 9 (45, 90, 135). Divisible by 5: all terms. Divisible by 7: none. Divisible by 3: 45, 60 (no), 75 (no), 90 (yes), 105 (yes), 120 (yes), 135 (yes), 150 (yes). So eight terms divisible by 3.

So:\n\n(a + b)(c + d) = k  \n(b + c)(a + d) = k  \n(a + c)(b + d) = k  \n\nSince all three are equal to k, maybe I can set them equal to each other and find relationships between a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me try equating the first and second expressions:\n\n(a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d  \nRight side: b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d\n\nSo, subtracting right side from left side:\n\na*c + a*d + b*c + b*d - (b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d)  \n= a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d - b*a - b*d - c*a - c*d  \nSimplify terms:\n\na*c cancels with -c*a  \na*d - b*a - c*d  \n+ b*c + b*d - b*d  \nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the terms:\n\nLeft: a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d  \nRight: b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d\n\nSo subtract right from left:\n\n(a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d) - (b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d)  \n= a*c - c*a + a*d - b*a + b*c - c*d + b*d - b*d  \nSimplify each term:\n\na*c - c*a = 0  \na*d - b*a = a(d - b)  \nb*c - c*d = c(b - d)  \nb*d - b*d = 0  \n\nSo combining:\n\n0 + a(d - b) + c(b - d) + 0  \n= a(d - b) - c(d - b)  \n= (a - c)(d - b)\n\nTherefore, the equation (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) simplifies to (a - c)(d - b) = 0.\n\nWhich means that either a = c or d = b.\n\nSimilarly, if we equate the second and third expressions:\n\n(b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d)\n\nExpanding:\n\nLeft: b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d  \nRight: a*b + a*d + c*b + c*d\n\nSubtract right from left:\n\nb*a + b*d + c*a + c*d - (a*b + a*d + c*b + c*d)  \n= b*a - a*b + b*d - a*d + c*a - c*b + c*d - c*d  \n= 0 + d(b - a) + a(c - b) + 0  \n= (d - a)(b - c)\n\nWait, let's check that again.\n\nLeft expansion: b*a + b*d + c*a + c*d  \nRight expansion: a*b + a*d + c*b + c*d\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n(b*a - a*b) + (b*d - a*d) + (c*a - c*b) + (c*d - c*d)  \n= 0 + d(b - a) + a(c - b) + 0  \n= d(b - a) + a(c - b)  \n= (b - a)d + (c - b)a  \n= (b - a)(d) + a(c - b)  \n= (b - a)(d - a) ?\n\nWait, maybe factor differently. Let's factor terms:\n\nTake (b - a) as common factor:\n\nFrom d(b - a) and a(c - b) = a(-1)(b - c)  \nHmm, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, let's write:\n\nd(b - a) + a(c - b)  \n= d(b - a) - a(b - c)  \n= (b - a)(d) - a(b - c)  \n= (b - a)(d - a) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me check with specific values. Suppose a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5:\n\nLeft: 3*2 + 3*5 + 4*2 + 4*5 = 6 + 15 + 8 + 20 = 49  \nRight: 2*3 + 2*5 + 4*3 + 4*5 = 6 + 10 + 12 + 20 = 48  \nSo difference is 1. Then (b - a)(d - a) = (3 - 2)(5 - 2)=1*3=3, which is not 1. Hmm, so maybe my factoring is wrong.\n\nWait, original expression after subtraction:\n\nd(b - a) + a(c - b) = 0  \nSo, d(b - a) = -a(c - b)  \n= a(b - c)  \nTherefore, d = [a(b - c)] / (b - a)\n\nBut since a, b, c, d are natural numbers, denominator (b - a) must divide the numerator a(b - c). Hmm, this might be a bit complicated. Maybe instead of directly expanding, use the same approach as before.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way. Let's note that we have two equations:\n\nFrom (a - c)(d - b) = 0  \nFrom (b - a)(d - a) = 0 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the two equations are related. Let's see:\n\nFirst equation: (a - c)(d - b) = 0  \nSecond equation: (b - a)(d - a) = 0\n\nSo, from the first equation, either a = c or d = b. From the second equation, either b = a or d = a.\n\nSo, possible cases:\n\nCase 1: a = c and b = a (from both equations). Then a = c = b. Then, since a = c = b, let's substitute into the original equation.\n\nBut we also have another equation: (a + c)(b + d) = k. Since a = b = c, then:\n\n(a + a)(a + d) = (2a)(a + d) = 2a(a + d) = k  \nSimilarly, (b + c)(a + d) = (2a)(a + d) = same as above. And (a + d)(b + c) = same. So all three products are equal to 2a(a + d). So, all three are equal. So, this case reduces to a = b = c, and d is any natural number such that a + b + c + d = 100. Since a = b = c, then 3a + d = 100, so d = 100 - 3a. Since a, d are positive integers, 3a < 100 => a ≤ 33. So a can be from 1 to 33, giving d from 100 - 3(1) = 97 down to 100 - 3*33 = 1. So 33 possible quadruples here.\n\nBut wait, are there other cases? Let's check Case 2.\n\nCase 2: From first equation, a = c, and from the second equation, d = a. So a = c and d = a. Then, substituting into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: (a + b)(c + d) = (a + b)(a + a) = (a + b)(2a) = k  \nSecond equation: (b + c)(a + d) = (b + a)(a + a) = (a + b)(2a) = k  \nThird equation: (a + c)(b + d) = (a + a)(b + a) = (2a)(a + b) = k  \n\nSo, all three products are equal to 2a(a + b). So again, this case reduces to a = c = d, and b is any natural number such that a + c + a + b = 3a + b = 100. Wait, no, a + b + c + d = a + b + a + a = 3a + b = 100. So 3a + b = 100. So b = 100 - 3a. Again, a must be such that 3a < 100, so a ≤ 33, same as before. Then b = 100 - 3a. So, this is similar to Case 1 but with different variables. However, in this case, since a = c = d, and b is different. Wait, but in this case, a = c = d, so we have three variables equal. So this is another set of solutions.\n\nWait, but in Case 1, we had a = b = c, and in Case 2, we have a = c = d. Are these overlapping? Let's see. If a = b = c = d, then all four variables are equal. But in that case, does 3a + b = 100? Wait, in the case where all four are equal, then 4a = 100, so a = 25. So a = b = c = d =25. Let's check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nCompute (a + b)(c + d) = (25 +25)(25 +25) = 50*50 =2500  \n(b + c)(a + d) = (25 +25)(25 +25) = same as above.  \n(a + c)(b + d) = same. So all three products are 2500. So this is a valid solution. So this case is included in both Case1 and Case2. Because in Case1, a = c = b, and in Case2, a = c = d. So the quadruple (25,25,25,25) is counted in both. Therefore, we need to subtract this overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nSimilarly, are there other overlapping cases? Let's check.\n\nCase3: From first equation, d = b, and from the second equation, d = a. So d = b = a. Then, substituting into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: (a + b)(c + d) = (a + a)(c + a) = (2a)(a + c) = k  \nSecond equation: (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(a + a) = (a + c)(2a) = k  \nThird equation: (a + c)(b + d) = (a + c)(a + a) = same as second equation.  \nTherefore, all three products equal to 2a(a + c). So this case reduces to d = a = b, and c is arbitrary such that a + a + a + c = 3a + c =100. Then c =100 -3a. So c must be a natural number, so 3a <100 => a ≤33. Therefore, a can be from1 to33, giving c from100 -3*1=97 down to1. This is another case where three variables are equal (b = a = d) and the fourth is different (c). So another set of solutions.\n\nSimilarly, in Case4: From first equation, d = b, and from the second equation, d = a. So d = a = b. Then substituting into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: (a + b)(c + d) = (a + a)(c + a) = 2a(a + c) =k  \nSecond equation: (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(a + a) = (a + c)(2a) =k  \nThird equation: (a + c)(b + d) = (a + c)(a + a) = same.  \nSo again, all three products equal to 2a(a + c). So this is similar to Case3 but with different variables. So here, a = b = d, and c is arbitrary such that 3a + c =100. Again, c =100 -3a, a from1 to33. So this is similar to Case3. So both cases3 and4 give the same set of solutions but with different variable assignments. But wait, in Case3, c is the variable, in Case4, c is another variable. Wait, no: in Case3, variables are (a, b, c, d) where a = b = d, c =100 -3a. In Case4, variables are (a, b, c, d) where a = b = d, c =100 -3a. Wait, same as Case3. So actually, Case3 and Case4 are the same case. Wait, no. Wait, in Case3, variables are (a, b, c, d) with a = b = d, c being determined. In Case4, variables are (a, b, c, d) with a = b = d. Wait, same variables. So actually, these are the same cases. Wait, but in Case3, d = a, and in Case4, d = a = b. So both lead to same variables. Hmm, maybe the overlapping cases are more than just Case1 and Case2.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple cases where different variables are equal. Let's see. The original equations give us (a - c)(d - b) =0 and (b - a)(d - a)=0. So, the product of two factors equals zero. So possible cases are:\n\n1. Both factors are zero: (a - c)=0 and (d - b)=0  \n2. First factor zero and second factor non-zero: (a - c)=0 and (d - a)=0  \n3. First factor non-zero and second factor zero: (d - b)=0 and (b - a)=0  \n4. Both factors non-zero: which would require (a - c)(d - b)=0 and (b - a", "answer": "Nejprve ekvivalentně upravíme první rovnici ze zadání:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d),\n\\]\n\\[\nac + ad + bc + bd = ba + bd + ca + cd,\n\\]\n\\[\nad + bc - ab - cd = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\na(d - b) - c(d - b) = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\n(a - c)(d - b) = 0.\n\\]\n\nPodobně zjistíme, že druhá rovnice je ekvivalentní s rovnicí, kterou pro přehled zapíšeme s upravenou první rovnicí vedle sebe:\n\n\\[\n(a - c)(d - b) = 0, \\quad (a - b)(d - c) = 0.\n\\]\n\nPodle toho, které ze čtyř činitelů se v odvozených rovnicích rovnají nule, jsou všechna řešení \\((a, b, c, d)\\) zadaných rovnic čtveřice jednoho ze čtyř typů:\n\n1. \\(a - c = 0 \\, \\text{a} \\, a - b = 0\\), neboli \\(a = b = c = d\\) je libovolné,\n2. \\(a - c = 0 \\, \\text{a} \\, d - c = 0\\), neboli \\(a = c = d \\, \\text{a} \\, b\\) je libovolné,\n3. \\(b - d = 0 \\, \\text{a} \\, b - a = 0\\), neboli \\(a = b = d \\, \\text{a} \\, c\\) je libovolné,\n4. \\(b - d = 0 \\, \\text{a} \\, c - d = 0\\), neboli \\(b = c = d \\, \\text{a} \\, a\\) je libovolné.\n\nDošli jsme k závěru, že rovnice ze zadání platí právě tehdy, když alespoň tři z čísel \\(a, b, c, d\\) jsou si rovna.

So:\n\n\\( \\min(2021 - n, -3n +2023) > -3n -2020 \\)\n\nWait, but since \\( m > -3n -2020 \\), and \\( m \\leq \\min(...) \\), we need \\( \\min(...) > -3n -2020 \\).\n\nBut let's check when \\( 2021 - n \\) is less than \\( -3n +2023 \\):\n\nSolve \\( 2021 - n < -3n +2023 \\):\n\nAdd \\( 3n \\) to both sides:\n\n\\( 2021 + 2n < 2023 \\)\n\nSubtract 2021:\n\n\\( 2n < 2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( n < 1 \\)\n\nTherefore, for \\( n < 1 \\), the upper bound is \\( 2021 - n \\), and for \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the upper bound is \\( -3n +2023 \\).\n\nBut \\( n \\) is an integer. Let's consider \\( n \\) as integers. Since \\( n = \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\), \\( n \\) can be any integer, but we need to find feasible \\( n \\) such that the upper bound is greater than the lower bound.\n\nBut let's consider possible ranges for \\( n \\). Let's think about possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( n = 2022 - 2x \\). Since \\( x \\) can be any real number, \\( n \\) can be any integer (positive or negative). But let's see if there are any constraints from the original equations.\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( m = 2023 - 3y \\), so \\( m \\) is also an integer. So \\( y \\) must be such that \\( 3y \\) is an integer, but \\( y \\) itself doesn't necessarily have to be an integer. However, \\( m = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor \\), which is an integer. So \\( 2x \\) must be in the interval \\([m, m +1)\\). Therefore, \\( x \\) must be in \\([m/2, (m +1)/2)\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( y \\) must be in \\([n, n +1)\\), and \\( x = (2022 - n)/2 \\).\n\nSo maybe we can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( n \\), then substitute into the inequalities for \\( y \\), then relate \\( m \\) to \\( n \\).\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nGiven \\( x = (2022 - n)/2 \\), substitute into the inequality \\( m \\leq 2022 - n -1 \\):\n\n\\( m \\leq 2021 - n \\)\n\nBut \\( m = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2*(2022 - n)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2022 - n \\rfloor \\)\n\nSince \\( 2022 - n \\) is an integer (because \\( n \\) is an integer), \\( m = 2022 - n \\)\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \\( m = 2022 - n \\)\n\nBut from the second equation, \\( m = 2023 - 3y \\). Therefore:\n\n\\( 2022 - n = 2023 - 3y \\)\n\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 3y = 2023 - (2022 - n) = 1 + n \\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\( y = (1 + n)/3 \\)\n\nBut \\( y \\) must satisfy \\( n \\leq y < n +1 \\).

The median is the value q such that when all these fractions are ordered from smallest to largest, exactly half are less than or equal to q and the other half are greater than or equal to q. Hmm, so the median is the middle value when they are ordered.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. Since there are k*n fractions, the median would be the ((k*n + 1)/2)th term when they are sorted. But since k and n can be any positive integers, the exact position might depend on their values. Wait, but the problem says \"the value of q such that [...] would be this median\". So I need to find q such that exactly half of the fractions are less than or equal to q and half are greater than or equal to q. But since some fractions might be equal, there could be an odd number of terms, in which case the median is the middle one.\n\nBut how do I compute this? Maybe I can approach it by considering the fractions in order and finding the dividing point. However, with k and n possibly large, enumerating all fractions isn't feasible. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nI recall that the Farey sequence comes into play when dealing with medians between fractions. The Farey sequence of order n is the set of reduced fractions between 0 and 1 with denominators ≤ n, arranged in order. The mediant of two fractions a/b and c/d is (a+c)/(b+d). The mediant lies between the two original fractions. However, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction obtained by taking the mediant of the smallest and largest fractions. Wait, the largest fraction is k/n, and the smallest is 1/1. Taking their mediant would give (1 + k)/(1 + n). But is this the median? Let's test with small examples.\n\nTake k=2, n=2. The fractions are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2. Wait, but 2/2 is 1, which is the same as 1/1. But maybe we consider only reduced fractions. So the unique fractions would be 1/1, 1/2, 2/1. But sorted, they are 1/2, 1/1, 2/1. The median would be 1/1. But according to the mediant idea, the mediant of 1/1 and 2/2 would be (1+2)/(1+2)=3/3=1, which is the same as 1/1. That works here.\n\nAnother example: k=3, n=2. The fractions are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/3, 2/3. Sorted: 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1. The median is the 3rd term: 2/3. The mediant of 1/1 and 3/2? Wait, but 3/2 is not in the list. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the mediant of 1/3 and 2/1 is (1+2)/(3+1)=3/4, which isn't present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the middle term is the fraction obtained by taking the mediant of the smallest and largest, but adjusted to be in reduced form. Wait, in the previous example, the mediant of 1/1 and 3/2 would be 4/3, but that's not in the list. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction with the numerator and denominator summing to k + n. Wait, in the first example, k=2, n=2, sum is 4. The fractions are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1. The sum for 1/1 is 2, for 1/2 it's 3, for 2/1 it's 3. So the median is 1/1, which is the fraction with the smallest sum. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding the fraction that is the median when all such fractions are ordered. Since the fractions are densely ordered, maybe the median is the fraction obtained by taking the mediant of the smallest and largest, but normalized. Wait, but in the first example, the mediant of 1/1 and 2/2 is 3/3=1, which is the same as 1/1. So maybe if the fractions are ordered, the median is the first fraction in the Farey sequence of order k + n that is greater than or equal to k/n, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction (k + n)/(k + n) = 1, but that's only if there's an even number of fractions. Wait, no. Wait, let's think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we have all fractions i/j where 1 ≤ i ≤ k and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Let's consider all possible numerators and denominators. To find the median, we need to find the fraction that is the middle value when all are ordered. Since the fractions are ordered between 0 and 1 (since i ≤ k and j ≥ i, so i/j ≤ k/n). Wait, actually, the fractions can be greater than 1 if i > j. Wait, but the problem states that i and j are positive integers, but does it require i/j to be between 0 and 1? The problem says \"fractions i/j\". Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that the fractions are between 0 and 1, but in the examples given, like k=2, n=2, the fractions are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2. 2/2 is 1, so they are considered as fractions. So the fractions can be greater than or equal to 0 and up. So the entire set includes fractions greater than 1, like 3/2 when k=3, n=2.\n\nSo the problem is more general. The fractions are all pairs (i,j) with 1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and we need to order all these fractions and find the median.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently? For small k and n, maybe we can generate all fractions, sort them, and find the median. But for larger values, this is not feasible. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me consider the fractions and their order. If we sort all fractions i/j in increasing order, the median is the value q such that exactly half of the fractions are ≤ q and half are ≥ q. If there are an odd number of fractions, then the middle one is the median.\n\nBut how to find q? Maybe we can model the fractions in terms of their numerator and denominator. The fractions can be compared by cross-multiplying: i/j < a/b if and only if i*b < a*j. So perhaps we can generate all fractions and sort them, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction (k + n)/(k + n) = 1, but that's only true if there are an even number of fractions. Wait, when k=1 and n=1, there's only one fraction, 1/1. The median is 1. When k=2, n=2, as before, the fractions include 1/1, 1/2, 2/1. Sorted: 1/2, 1/1, 2/1. The median is 1/1. So in that case, the median is 1. Wait, but 1 is equal to k/n = 2/2 = 1. So maybe when k = n, the median is 1.\n\nWait, in the first example, k=2, n=2, the median is 1. In the second example, k=3, n=2, the median is 2/3. Hmm, so that doesn't hold.\n\nWait, in the second example, k=3, n=2. The fractions are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/3, 2/3. Sorted: 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1. The median is the third term: 2/3. Which is indeed 2/3, which is the mediant of 1/1 and 2/1, but since 2/1 is not in the list, maybe it's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction obtained by taking the mediant of the mediant and the next one, but this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the fractions can be represented as points in a grid where the x-axis is the denominator j and the y-axis is the numerator i, with 1 ≤ i ≤ k and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The fractions are then the points (j, i) in the first quadrant. The problem reduces to finding the median of all such points when ordered by their value.\n\nBut how to order them? The usual way is to compare the fractions i/j and i'/j' by cross-multiplying: i/j < i'/j' if and only if i*j' < i'*j. So the fractions can be sorted by comparing these products.\n\nBut generating all fractions and sorting them is computationally expensive for large k and n. Therefore, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the Farey sequence. The Farey sequence of order m is the set of reduced fractions between 0 and 1 with denominators ≤ m, sorted in order. The mediant of two consecutive terms in the Farey sequence is the fraction that lies between them. However, the Farey sequence is for fractions between 0 and 1, but in our problem, the fractions can be greater than 1. So maybe the approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can consider the mediant of 0/1 and 1/1. The mediant is (0 + 1)/(1 + 1) = 1/2, which is the median in some cases. For example, when k=1 and n=1, the only fraction is 1/1, so the median is 1. If k=1 and n=2, the fractions are 1/1, 1/2. Sorted: 1/2, 1/1. Median is 1/1. Hmm, that's not 1/2. Wait, but 1/2 is the first fraction. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the median is the fraction (k + n)/(k + n) = 1, which is 1. But when k=1 and n=1, that's 2/2=1, but the only fraction is 1/1. So in that case, the median is 1. When k=1 and n=2, the fractions are 1/1 and 1/2. The median is 1/1, which is greater than 1/2. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the median is the value q such that when you list all fractions in order, half are ≤ q and half are ≥ q. In this case, there are two fractions, 1/2 and 1/1. If we sort them, they are 1/2, 1/1. The median would be the average of the two, but since we need a real number, the median is 3/4? Wait, no. Wait, when there are an even number of elements, the median is typically defined as the average of the two middle values. However, in the problem statement, it says \"the value q such that when the fractions are ordered from smallest to largest, up to that term, the fractions are ≤ q, and up to that term, the fractions are ≥ q\". Wait, maybe the problem is using the standard definition where the median is the middle value, which could be an average if the number is even. But the problem says \"the value of q such that [...] up to that term\", so maybe it's the middle value, not the average. So for two elements, the median would be the first element if we order them in ascending order. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nSuppose we have two fractions: 1/2 and 1/1. Sorting them in ascending order gives 1/2, 1/1. Then, the first term is 1/2, the second is 1/1. The median would be the value q such that up to the first term, all fractions are ≤ q, and up to the second term, all are ≥ q. So q must be 1/2, because after the first term, all fractions are ≥ 1/2, and after the second term, they are ≤ 1/1. So the median is 1/2. But in this case, the median is the first term. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier examples where the median was the second term.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again:\n\n\"the value of q such that when the fractions are ordered from smallest to largest, up to that term, the fractions are ≤ q, and up to that term, the fractions are ≥ q.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's saying that up to the term where there are half of the fractions ≤ q and half ≥ q. So for even number of fractions, the median would be the average of the two middle terms. For odd number, it's the middle term.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the value q such that when the fractions are ordered from smallest to largest, up to that term, the fractions are ≤ q, and up to that term, the fractions are ≥ q\". So, up to the term where there are half of the fractions ≤ q and half ≥ q. So for example, if there are 4 fractions, the median would be the second term (since up to the second term, two are ≤ q and two are ≥ q). If there are 5 fractions, the third term.\n\nTherefore, the median is the (k*n + 1)/2-th term when the fractions are sorted. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the value at that position.\n\nTherefore, the task is to find the value in the sorted list of fractions i/j (1 ≤ i ≤k, 1 ≤ j ≤n) at position ((k*n + 1)/2) when sorted in ascending order.\n\nBut how to compute this without generating all fractions? Let's think about the structure of the fractions.\n\nEach fraction i/j is a point in a grid where the x-axis is j and y-axis is i. The fractions can be compared by cross-multiplication. For two fractions a/b and c/d, a/b < c/d if and only if a*d < c*b.\n\nSo, if we can generate all fractions in order, we can find the median.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what M is. Since we're dealing with a 3x3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9, each number is used exactly once. So, M is the total number of permutations of 9 numbers in a 3x3 grid. The total number of permutations is 9! = 362880. But we're not going to compute M directly; we need to find L and then take their ratio.\n\nNow, L is the number of these permutations (tables) where every row sum and every column sum is odd. Each row has three numbers, and each column has three numbers. The sum of three numbers is odd if the count of odd numbers in that row or column is odd. Since three numbers sum to an odd number, the row or column must contain exactly one or three odd numbers. But since we're dealing with three numbers, which is an odd count, the sum is odd only if there's an odd number of odd numbers in the row or column. So, each row must have either 1 or 3 odd numbers, and each column must also have either 1 or 3 odd numbers.\n\nWait, but the entire grid has 9 numbers. The total number of odd numbers in the grid can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. However, each row has 3 elements, and each column has 3 elements. The sum of all row sums is 3*(sum of numbers in one row) = 3*(sum of numbers in one column) = total sum of all numbers in the grid. The total sum of numbers from 1 to 9 is 45, which is odd. So, the total sum is 45, which is odd. Therefore, the sum of all row sums is 45. Since each row sum is odd, the sum of three odd numbers is odd. But 3 odd numbers summed give an odd total. Wait, 3 odd numbers sum to an odd number. But 45 is odd, so the sum of three odd numbers is odd. That's okay. But if each row has an odd sum, then the sum of all row sums is 3*odd = odd, which matches 45. Similarly, the sum of all column sums would also need to be 45. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of odd numbers in the grid? Let's think. Each row has 3 numbers, each column has 3 numbers. The total number of odd numbers in the grid can be related to the number of rows with odd sums and columns with odd sums. Wait, maybe we need to consider the parity of the number of odd numbers in each row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too advanced for a problem that's likely intended to be solved combinatorially. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFirst, note that in order for each row to have an odd sum, each row must contain an odd number of odd numbers. Similarly, each column must contain an odd number of odd numbers. So, in terms of parity, each row and column must have an odd count of odd numbers.\n\nBut how does this affect the total number of odd numbers in the grid? Let's think. The total number of odd numbers in the grid is equal to the sum of the number of odd numbers in each row. Since each row has an odd number of odd numbers (either 1 or 3), the total number of odd numbers is the sum of three odd numbers. The sum of three odd numbers is odd. But the total number of odd numbers must also be equal to the sum of the number of odd numbers in each column, which is also the sum of three odd numbers. So, both the row counts and column counts contribute to the total number of odd numbers, which must be odd. That's consistent because 45 is odd, so the total number of odd numbers in the grid must be odd.\n\nBut how do we count the number of such grids? Let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a 3x3 grid, each row and each column must contain an odd number of odd numbers. Let's denote the number of odd numbers in each row as r1, r2, r3. Then r1 + r2 + r3 must be odd, and similarly for the columns. However, since each column must also have an odd number of odd numbers, c1 + c2 + c3 must be odd. But the total number of odd numbers is r1 + r2 + r3 = c1 + c2 + c3. Therefore, this is consistent.\n\nBut each ri and ci is the number of odd numbers in row i or column i, respectively. Since each ri and ci is odd (either 1 or 3), the total number of odd numbers must be the sum of three odd numbers, which is odd. So, the total number of odd numbers is odd, which is consistent with the total sum being 45.\n\nNow, let's think of the grid in terms of the positions. Each cell in the grid can be either odd or even. So, the grid is a 3x3 grid with some cells colored \"odd\" and others \"even\". The problem is equivalent to counting the number of 3x3 binary matrices (with entries 0 and 1, where 1 represents odd and 0 represents even) such that each row has an odd number of 1s and each column has an odd number of 1s, and then multiplying by the number of ways to assign the actual numbers 1-9 into the odd and even positions.\n\nSo, first step: count the number of such binary matrices. Then, for each such matrix, we need to assign the numbers 1-9 into the \"1\" positions (odd numbers) and \"0\" positions (even numbers) in the grid. The number of ways to do this is (number of permutations) = (number of odd positions)! * (number of even positions)!.\n\nBut first, let's figure out how many such binary matrices exist. Let's denote this number as N. Then, the total number of valid grids L is N multiplied by the product of the factorials of the number of odd and even positions. Wait, but actually, once we fix the positions of the odd numbers (which are allocated to \"1\"s in the binary matrix), we can permute the numbers 1-9 in those positions. So, if there are O odd positions, then the number of ways to assign the numbers is O! * (9 - O)!.\n\nBut first, we need to compute N, the number of 3x3 binary matrices with each row and column containing an odd number of 1s. Then, the number of such matrices is known in combinatorics. Let me recall that for an n x n matrix, the number of binary matrices with row and column sums odd is 2^{(n-1)^2}. Wait, but that's for the case where n is arbitrary. For example, for a 2x2 matrix, the number is 2^{1} = 2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, for a 2x2 matrix where each row and column has an odd parity. Let's list all possible matrices. There are 16 possible binary matrices. Let's see which ones have each row and column sum odd.\n\nEach row must have odd parity (1 or 3 ones). Since each row has two entries, the only way is to have one 1 and one 0 in each row. Similarly, each column must have one 1 and one 0. So, how many such matrices are there?\n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the first row can be [1,0] or [0,1]. Suppose first row is [1,0]. Then the second row must be [0,1] to have column sums odd. Then, the columns are [1,0] and [0,1], which are both odd. Similarly, if the first row is [0,1], the second row must be [1,0]. So, there are 2 such matrices. So, for 2x2, N=2=2^{(2-1)^2}=2^1=2. That works. For a 1x1 matrix, the number of binary matrices with row and column sum odd is 0, since you can't have a single entry that is both odd and even. Wait, but in a 1x1 matrix, the row sum and column sum must be odd. The only way is if the entry is 1, but 1 is odd, so the matrix [[1]] is valid. Wait, but 1 is odd, so the count is 1. However, 2^{(1-1)^2}=1, which matches. So the formula seems to hold: for an n x n matrix, the number is 2^{(n-1)^2}.\n\nBut wait, for n=3x3, that would give 2^{4}=16. Let's check that. If we have a 3x3 matrix where each row and column has an odd number of 1s, how many such matrices are there? Is it 16?\n\nLet me think. For each row, the number of 1s must be odd (1 or 3). Similarly, each column. But since the total number of 1s must be the same when counted per row or per column. For a 3x3 matrix, each row has 1 or 3 ones. Let's see. Suppose we have k rows with 1 one and (3 - k) rows with 3 ones. Similarly for columns. But the total number of ones must be equal from both perspectives. Let's suppose that there are a rows with 1 one and (3 - a) rows with 3 ones. Then total ones = a*1 + (3 - a)*3 = 3a + 9 - 3a = 9. So, the total number of ones is 9, which is possible only if every row has 3 ones. But that's not possible because the columns would each have 3 ones, which is odd. Wait, but each row has 3 ones, so each column also has 3 ones. So, if all rows have 3 ones, then all columns must have 3 ones. Therefore, the only possible such matrix is the one where every row and column has 3 ones. That is, the all-ones matrix. But that matrix has all entries as 1, which is allowed. But that's only one matrix. But according to the formula 2^{(n-1)^2}=16 for 3x3, which is way more. So, clearly, my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. For a 3x3 matrix, each row and column must have an odd number of ones. The total number of ones is the sum of the row sums or the sum of the column sums. Since each row sum is odd (either 1 or 3) and there are three rows, the total number of ones is 3*(1 or 3), which can be 3, 9. If it's 9, then every row and every column has 3 ones, which is the all-ones matrix. If it's 3, then we need each row to have 1 one, and each column to have 1 one. Wait, but if each row has 1 one and each column has 1 one, then it's a permutation matrix. There are 6 permutation matrices for 3x3. However, permutation matrices have exactly one 1 in each row and each column. So, there are 6 such matrices. But according to the formula 2^{(n-1)^2}=16, which is different. So, clearly, the formula doesn't apply here. So, my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula for the number of binary matrices with row and column sums odd is different. Let me check for n=3.\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, with each row and column sum odd, how many matrices are there?\n\nLet me try to count them. Let's denote the matrix as:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\ng h i\n\nEach of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i is 0 or 1. Each row sum (a+b+c, d+e+f, g+h+i) must be odd, and each column sum (a+d+g, b+e+h, c+f+i) must be odd.\n\nOne way to approach this is to fix the first two rows and columns, and then determine the remaining entries. Let's fix the first two rows and first two columns.\n\nSuppose we fix the entries a, b, d, e. Then, the remaining entries are c, f, g, h, i. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: a + b + c ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nRow 2: d + e + f ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nColumn 1: a + d + g ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nColumn 2: b + e + h ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nThen, let's see:\n\nFrom row 1: c ≡ 1 - a - b mod 2\n\nFrom row 2: f ≡ 1 - d - e mod 2\n\nFrom column 1: g ≡ 1 - a - d mod 2\n\nFrom column 2: h ≡ 1 - b - e mod 2\n\nThen, the remaining entries are c, f, g, h, i. However, we also have row 3 and column 3.\n\nRow 3: g + h + i ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nColumn 3: c + f + i ≡ 1 mod 2\n\nSo, from row 3: i ≡ 1 - g - h mod 2\n\nFrom column 3: i ≡ 1 - c - f mod 2\n\nTherefore, we need:\n\n1 - g - h ≡ 1 - c - f mod 2\n\nSimplify: -g - h ≡ -c - f mod 2 ⇒ g + h ≡ c + f mod 2\n\nBut we already have expressions for g, h, c, f in terms of a, b, d, e. Let's substitute:\n\ng = 1 - a - d\n\nh = 1 - b - e\n\nc = 1 - a - b\n\nf = 1 - d - e\n\nSo, c + f = (1 - a - b) + (1 - d - e) = 2 - a - b - d - e ≡ 0 - a - b - d - e mod 2\n\nSimilarly, g + h = (1 - a - d) + (1 - b - e) = ", "answer": "Počet \\( M \\) všech možných vyplnění tabulky \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) čísly od 1 do 9 má hodnotu \\( M = 9! \\) (viz nápovědu úlohu N2).\n\nAbychom určili hodnotu \\( L \\), zabývejme se nejdříve otázkou, jak v tabulce \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) vybrat pozice pro sudá a lichá čísla, aby vyplněná tabulka měla součet tří čísel v každém řádku i sloupci lichý.

For a quadratic equation \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\) to have a double root, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant is \\( B^2 - 4AC \\). Therefore, for both equations, the discriminants must be zero.\n\nLet me compute the discriminants for both equations.\n\nFirst equation discriminant:\n\n\\( D_1 = (a^2 + b^2)^2 - 4(a + b)(2ab) \\)\n\nSecond equation discriminant:\n\n\\( D_2 = (2ab)^2 - 4(a + b)(a^2 + b^2) \\)\n\nSet both discriminants equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( (a^2 + b^2)^2 - 4(a + b)(2ab) = 0 \\)\n2. \\( (2ab)^2 - 4(a + b)(a^2 + b^2) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nEquation (1): \\( (a^2 + b^2)^2 - 8ab(a + b) = 0 \\)\n\nEquation (2): \\( 4a^2 b^2 - 4(a + b)(a^2 + b^2) = 0 \\)\n\nLet me denote equation (1) as D1 and equation (2) as D2. Let me try to simplify these equations.\n\nFirst, equation D2: 4a²b² - 4(a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\nFactor out 4:\n\n4[ a²b² - (a + b)(a² + b²) ] = 0\n\nSo, divide both sides by 4:\n\na²b² - (a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\nLet me compute (a + b)(a² + b²):\n\n= a(a² + b²) + b(a² + b²)\n\n= a³ + a b² + a² b + b³\n\nSo, equation D2 becomes:\n\na²b² - (a³ + a b² + a² b + b³) = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= a²b² - a³ - a b² - a² b - b³ = 0\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n= -a³ - a² b + a² b² - a b² - b³ = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe factor terms differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor:\n\na²b² - (a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor out (a + b):\n\nBut (a + b)(a² + b²) is a different term. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps factor as follows:\n\nLet me try grouping terms:\n\na²b² - (a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\n= a²b² - a³ - a b² - a² b - b³ = 0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\n= a²b² - a³ - a² b - a b² - b³\n\n= a²b² - a² b - a³ - a b² - b³\n\n= a²b(b - 1) - a³ - a b² - b³\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe factor as a²b² - (a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me let S = a + b and P = ab. Then, a² + b² = S² - 2P. Let me try substituting.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b, P = ab.\n\nThen, equation D2:\n\n4a²b² - 4(a + b)(a² + b²) = 0\n\n= 4P² - 4S(S² - 2P) = 0\n\nFactor out 4:\n\n4[ P² - S(S² - 2P) ] = 0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nP² - S³ + 2S P = 0\n\nSo, equation D2 becomes:\n\nP² + 2S P - S³ = 0\n\nSimilarly, equation D1:\n\n(a² + b²)^2 - 4(a + b)(2ab) = 0\n\nIn terms of S and P:\n\n(a² + b²)^2 = (S² - 2P)^2\n\nSo, equation D1:\n\n(S² - 2P)^2 - 8S P = 0\n\nExpand (S² - 2P)^2:\n\n= S^4 - 4 S² P + 4 P²\n\nThus, equation D1:\n\nS^4 - 4 S² P + 4 P² - 8 S P = 0\n\nSo, now, we have two equations in terms of S and P:\n\n1. P² + 2 S P - S³ = 0 (Equation D2)\n\n2. S^4 - 4 S² P + 4 P² - 8 S P = 0 (Equation D1)\n\nLet me see if I can solve these equations.\n\nFrom Equation D2: P² + 2 S P - S³ = 0\n\nLet me solve for P²: P² = S³ - 2 S P\n\nSubstitute this into Equation D1:\n\nS^4 - 4 S² P + 4(S³ - 2 S P) - 8 S P = 0\n\nExpand:\n\nS^4 - 4 S² P + 4 S³ - 8 S P - 8 S P = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nS^4 + 4 S³ - 4 S² P - 16 S P = 0\n\nFactor S:\n\nS(S³ + 4 S² - 4 S P - 16 P) = 0\n\nSo, either S = 0 or S³ + 4 S² - 4 S P - 16 P = 0\n\nCase 1: S = 0\n\nIf S = a + b = 0, then from equation D2: P² + 2 * 0 * P - 0³ = P² = 0 => P = 0\n\nSo, a + b = 0 and ab = 0. Therefore, either a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nBut since a + b = 0, if a = 0, then b = 0. Similarly, if b = 0, then a = 0.\n\nTherefore, the pair (a, b) = (0, 0). But let's check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nIf a = 0 and b = 0, then P(x) = x² and Q(x) = x². Then, the first equation is 0*P(x) + 0*Q(x) = 0, which is 0 = 0, a trivial equation, but technically a quadratic equation with double roots (any roots). Similarly, the second equation is 0*Q(x) + 0*P(x) = 0, which is also trivial. So, this pair is a solution.\n\nCase 2: S³ + 4 S² - 4 S P - 16 P = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me factor this equation:\n\nS³ + 4 S² - 4 S P - 16 P = 0\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n(S³ + 4 S²) - (4 S P + 16 P) = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nS²(S + 4) - 4 P(S + 4) = 0\n\nFactor out (S + 4):\n\n(S + 4)(S² - 4 P) = 0\n\nTherefore, either S + 4 = 0 or S² - 4 P = 0\n\nSo, two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: S + 4 = 0 => S = -4\n\nSubcase 2b: S² - 4 P = 0 => P = S² / 4\n\nLet me handle Subcase 2a first: S = -4\n\nSo, S = a + b = -4\n\nFrom equation D2: P² + 2 S P - S³ = 0\n\nSubstitute S = -4:\n\nP² + 2*(-4)*P - (-4)^3 = 0\n\n=> P² - 8 P + 64 = 0\n\nSolve this quadratic equation:\n\nDiscriminant: 64 - 256 = -192\n\nNegative discriminant, so no real solutions for P. Therefore, Subcase 2a gives no real solutions.\n\nSubcase 2b: P = S² / 4\n\nSo, ab = (a + b)^2 / 4\n\nBut we also have from equation D2: P² + 2 S P - S³ = 0\n\nSubstitute P = S² / 4 into equation D2:\n\n(S² / 4)^2 + 2*S*(S² / 4) - S³ = 0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: S^4 / 16\n\nSecond term: 2 S * S² / 4 = (2 S^3)/4 = S^3 / 2\n\nThird term: - S³\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nS^4 / 16 + S^3 / 2 - S³ = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nS^4 / 16 - S^3 / 2 = 0\n\nFactor out S^3:\n\nS^3 (S / 16 - 1/2) = 0\n\nTherefore, either S^3 = 0 => S = 0, which is Subcase 1, or S / 16 - 1/2 = 0 => S = 8\n\nBut S = a + b, so S = 8.\n\nSo, S = 8 and P = (8)^2 / 4 = 64 / 4 = 16\n\nTherefore, S = 8 and P = 16\n\nThus, a + b = 8 and ab = 16\n\nSo, we have a system of equations:\n\na + b = 8\n\nab = 16\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x² - 8x + 16 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\nDiscriminant: 64 - 64 = 0\n\nSo, x = (8 ± 0)/2 = 4\n\nTherefore, a = 4, b = 4. So, the pair is (4, 4)\n\nNow, need to check if this pair satisfies the original equations.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf a = 4, b = 4, then P(x) = x² + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2\n\nSimilarly, Q(x) = x² + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2\n\nTherefore, both P and Q are the same quadratic. Then, the first equation is 4P(x) + 4Q(x) = 8P(x) + 8Q(x) = 16(x + 2)^2 = 0\n\nWhich is a quadratic equation with double root at x = -2\n\nSimilarly, the second equation is 4Q(x) + 4P(x) = 8Q(x) + 8P(x) = 16(x + 2)^2 = 0, same as above.\n\nSo, both equations are the same quadratic equation, so they have the same double root. So, this pair (4, 4) is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are (0, 0) and (4, 4).\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other solutions. Because in our substitution, we considered S = a + b and P = ab, and found S = 0 or S = 8. But when S = 0, we got (0, 0). When S = 8, we got (4, 4). So, are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, in our analysis, we considered S³ + 4 S² - 4 S P - 16 P = 0 leading to (S + 4)(S² - 4 P) = 0. Then, for S ≠ -4, we have S² - 4 P = 0, which led to S = 8 (since S = 0 led to P = 0", "answer": "Obě zadané rovnice po dosazení trojčlenů \\( P \\) a \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[\na(x^2 + ax + b) + b(x^2 + bx + a) = 0, \\quad \\text{resp.} \\quad a(x^2 + bx + a) + b(x^2 + ax + b) = 0\n\\]\n\nupravíme do standardního tvaru:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)x^2 + (a^2 + b^2)x + 2ab = 0, \\quad \\text{resp.} \\quad (a + b)x^2 + 2abx + (a^2 + b^2) = 0. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nVidíme, že v případě \\( a + b = 0 \\) nejsou tyto rovnice kvadratické, což odporuje zadání.

Kolik z nich nabývá celočíselné hodnoty?", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the fractions given in the sequence \\(\\frac{0}{2022}, \\frac{1}{2021}, \\frac{2}{2020}, \\ldots, \\frac{2021}{1}\\) have integer values. Each of these fractions is a reduced fraction because the numerator and denominator are consecutive integers, right? Let me start by understanding the sequence better.\n\nFirst, the sequence starts at 0/2022 and goes up to 2021/1. Each term is \\(\\frac{k}{2022 - k}\\) where k starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time until it reaches 2021. So for each k from 0 to 2021, the fraction is \\(\\frac{k}{2022 - k}\\). The problem states that each of these fractions is equal to 2022, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold on. The problem says \"each fraction is equal to 2022\", but looking at the first term, 0/2022 is 0, which is not 2022. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"the fractions, whose sum is equal to 2022\". Oh, right! The sum of the fractions is 2022, but each individual fraction is not equal to 2022. So the question is asking how many of these fractions (each of which is k/(2022 - k)) evaluate to an integer. So, for each term in the sequence, we need to check if k divided by (2022 - k) is an integer. And we need to count how many such terms exist where this is true.\n\nSo, the key here is to find all integers k between 0 and 2021 inclusive such that (2022 - k) divides k exactly. That is, (2022 - k) is a divisor of k. Let me formalize this condition. Let me denote d = 2022 - k. Then, k = 2022 - d. So substituting back into the equation, we have d divides (2022 - d). So, d divides (2022 - d), which implies that d divides 2022. Because (2022 - d) mod d = (2022 mod d - d mod d) = 2022 mod d. So for d to divide (2022 - d), d must divide 2022. Therefore, d is a positive divisor of 2022, and since k = 2022 - d must be between 0 and 2021 inclusive, we can find all divisors d of 2022 and check if 2022 - d is in [0, 2021].\n\nWait, but k has to be between 0 and 2021. So, k = 2022 - d >= 0, which implies d <= 2022. But since d is a divisor of 2022, and 2022 is positive, d is positive. So all divisors d of 2022 are positive, so k = 2022 - d will be between 2022 - d. Since d is a positive divisor, d >=1, so k <=2021. Also, d can be up to 2022, so k would be 2022 - 2022 = 0. So k can range from 0 to 2021. Therefore, the possible values of d are all positive divisors of 2022, and each such d gives a k = 2022 - d. Therefore, the number of such k is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2022.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check this again. If d divides 2022, then k = 2022 - d. So for each positive divisor d of 2022, there is a corresponding k. But k must also be between 0 and 2021 inclusive. Since d is a divisor of 2022, d >=1, so k = 2022 - d <= 2022 -1 = 2021. And k = 2022 - d >= 2022 - 2022 = 0. So k is in [0, 2021]. Therefore, all positive divisors d of 2022 will give a valid k. Therefore, the number of such fractions is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2022.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the number of positive divisors of 2022.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 2022. Let's divide 2022 by 2: 2022 ÷ 2 = 1011. Then, 1011 ÷ 3 = 337. Now, check if 337 is a prime number. Let's test divisibility by primes up to sqrt(337) ≈ 18.36. So check primes 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. 337 ÷2=168.5, nope. 337 ÷3=112.333, nope. 337 ÷5=67.4, nope. 337 ÷7≈48.14, nope. 337 ÷11≈30.63, nope. 337 ÷13≈25.92, nope. 337 ÷17≈19.82, nope. So 337 is prime. Therefore, 2022 factors into 2 × 3 × 337. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2×2×2=8.\n\nTherefore, 2022 has 8 positive divisors. Therefore, there are 8 values of d, each corresponding to a unique k, so 8 fractions in the sequence that are integers.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, let me make sure that when we have d as a divisor of 2022, then k = 2022 - d is in [0, 2021], which it is, and each d corresponds to a unique k, so the count is 8. Therefore, the answer should be 8.\n\nBut let me check with specific examples. Let's take the first few terms:\n\n- When k = 0: 0/2022 = 0, which is an integer. But k=0, d=2022 - 0 = 2022. Is 2022 a divisor of 2022? Yes, 2022 divides 2022. So that's one.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier logic, d is a positive divisor of 2022, so d can be 1,2,3,6,337,674,1011,2022. Then k = 2022 - d. So for each d, k is:\n\n- d=1: k=2021\n- d=2: k=2020\n- d=3: k=2019\n- d=6: k=2016\n- d=337: k=2022 - 337 = 1685\n- d=674: k=2022 - 674 = 1348\n- d=1011: k=2022 - 1011 = 1011\n- d=2022: k=2022 - 2022 = 0\n\nSo each of these k's gives a fraction that is an integer. Therefore, 8 fractions. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility that some k's might give the same fraction but different divisors? Wait, but each k corresponds to exactly one d. Because d = 2022 - k, so for each k, there's a unique d. Therefore, each k is unique, so each d is unique. Therefore, each d gives a unique k, so 8 fractions. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nBut wait, let's test with k=0. The fraction is 0/2022=0, which is an integer. Similarly, k=2021: 2021/1=2021, which is an integer. So both k=0 and k=2021 give integers. Then k=1: 1/2021. Is 2021 a divisor of 1? No. Similarly, k=2: 2/2020. 2020 divides 2? 2020/2=1010, so 2020 divides 2? No, because 2020 is larger than 2, so 2020 can't divide 2. So only k=0 and k=2021 (and their counterparts) would be integers. Wait, but according to the earlier logic, all divisors d of 2022 give k=2022 - d, which are 2021, 2020, 2019, 2016, 1685, 1348, 1011, 0. Each of these k's gives a fraction that is an integer. Therefore, that's 8 fractions. So the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me check if k=0 and k=2021 are the only ones. Let's take d=1: k=2021, which works. d=2: k=2020. Wait, but 2020/2020 is 1, which is an integer. Similarly, d=3: k=2019, 2019/2013= 2019/2013= 3*673 / (3*671) simplifies to 673/671, which is not an integer. Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, wait, the fraction is k/(2022 - k). So when d=3, k=2022 -3=2019. Then the fraction is 2019/3=673, which is an integer. Wait, so 2019 divided by 3 is 673. So that works. Similarly, d=6: k=2022-6=2016. 2016/6=336. Integer. So that works. Similarly, d=337: k=2022-337=1685. 1685 divided by 337. Let's compute 337*5=1685. So 1685/337=5. So that works. Similarly, d=674: k=2022-674=1348. 1348 divided by 674. 674*2=1348. So 1348/674=2. Integer. Similarly, d=1011: k=2022-1011=1011. 1011/1011=1. Integer. d=2022: k=0. 0/2022=0. Integer.\n\nTherefore, all these k's from d=1,2,3,6,337,674,1011,2022 give fractions that are integers. Each of these d's are divisors of 2022, so that's 8 divisors, hence 8 fractions. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me verify with an example where maybe k is not a divisor of 2022. Let's take k=1. The fraction is 1/2021. 2021 divides 1? No. Similarly, k=2: 2/2020. 2020 divides 2? No. So only when k=0 and k=2021, which correspond to d=2022 and d=1, which are divisors of 2022, do we get integers. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this problem is to consider that the fraction k/(2022 - k) is an integer if and only if 2022 - k divides k. That is, 2022 - k divides k, which implies that 2022 - k divides k + (2022 - k) = 2022. Therefore, 2022 - k divides 2022. Therefore, 2022 - k is a positive divisor of 2022. Since k is between 0 and 2021, 2022 - k is between 1 and 2022. Therefore, the positive divisors of 2022 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 337, 674, 1011, 2022. Each of these divisors corresponds to a value of 2022 - k, so k = 2022 - d. So the number of such k is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2022, which is 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of fractions in the sequence that evaluate to an integer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of such integers is \\boxed{8}.So I can see that the original prompt is written in Afrikaans.

So, we need to find the largest natural number n ≥ 10 such that for any 10 distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, at least two of them are not primes, and if they are primes, their sum is also a prime. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about guaranteeing that in any group of 10 numbers from 1 to n, either there are two non-primes, or if there are primes, their sum is also prime. So, n needs to be such that this condition is always true, no matter which 10 numbers you pick. And we need the largest such n.\n\nLet me rephrase the goal. We need n to be as large as possible, but still ensuring that in any subset of 10 numbers, either there are two non-primes, or all primes in the subset sum to primes. So, to maximize n, we need to make sure that if we can have a subset of 10 primes, their sums must be prime. But since the primes can be up to n, we need to check what's the maximum n where this holds.\n\nFirst, let's recall the primes. The primes less than or equal to n will be part of any such subset. The non-primes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.) are the numbers that are not primes. So, in the set {1, 2, ..., n}, the primes are the primes starting from 2 up to the largest prime ≤ n. The non-primes are the rest.\n\nOur task is to ensure that in any 10-number subset, either there are two non-primes, or all primes in that subset sum to a prime. So, if a subset has 10 numbers, and all 10 are primes, then their sum must also be prime. But wait, the sum of 10 primes... primes are odd except for 2, which is even. So, adding 10 primes: if all are odd, their sum is even (since 10 is even, 10 odd numbers sum to even). The only even prime is 2. So, the sum would be at least 2 + 2 + ... + 2 = 20, which is not prime. Therefore, the sum of 10 odd primes is even and greater than 2, hence composite. So, the sum would be composite. Therefore, if we have a subset of 10 primes, their sum is composite, so the condition is satisfied. So, in such a case, the condition that the sum is prime is automatically false, but the problem states that if all are primes, then the sum is prime. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the problem says: \"if they are primes, their sum is also prime.\" So, if all are primes, then the sum must be prime. But in our case, if all 10 numbers are primes, their sum is composite (as above), which would violate the condition. Therefore, such a subset would not satisfy the problem's requirement. Therefore, the problem is saying that such a subset cannot exist. Therefore, our n must be such that there is no subset of 10 numbers where all are primes and their sum is prime. But as we saw, the sum of 10 odd primes is even and composite. So, the only way the sum could be prime is if one of the primes is 2. Because 10 is even, so if we have 10 primes, and one of them is 2, then the sum would be 2 + 9 other primes. The sum would be 2 + sum of 9 primes. Let's see: sum of 9 primes. If all are odd, sum is odd + 2 = odd + even = odd. So, 2 + odd = odd. So, the sum would be odd. Then, is that sum prime?\n\nSo, if we have a subset containing 2 and 9 primes (all odd), then the sum is 2 + sum of 9 primes. Let's check if that sum could be prime. For example, take the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Wait, but we need 10 numbers. If we have 2 and 9 primes. Let's take 2 and the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Then sum is 2 + (3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29) = 2 + 129 = 131, which is prime. So, in that case, the sum is prime. Therefore, such a subset would not satisfy the condition, because if all are primes, their sum is prime. Therefore, in order to make sure that such subsets do not exist, we need to prevent having a subset of 10 primes where the sum is prime. Wait, but in the example above, the sum was prime. So, in order to have n such that there is no subset of 10 primes where their sum is prime. Wait, but the problem says: \"if they are primes, then their sum is also prime\". Therefore, the problem is stating that if all 10 numbers are primes, then their sum is prime. Therefore, we need to ensure that in the set {1, 2, ..., n}, there is no subset of 10 primes whose sum is prime. Because if such a subset exists, then by the problem's condition, the statement would be false.\n\nWait, so the problem is to find the largest n such that in any 10-number subset, either there are two non-primes, or all primes in the subset sum to a prime. Therefore, to ensure that such a subset does not exist, we need that for any 10-number subset, either there are two non-primes, or if all are primes, their sum is composite. So, to ensure that for n, there is no subset of 10 primes whose sum is prime. Therefore, our task is to find the largest n where this is true. Then, the answer would be that n.\n\nSo, to rephrase, we need the largest n such that the only 10-number subsets containing 10 primes have a sum that is composite. Therefore, n is the largest number such that in {1, 2, ..., n}, there is no 10-element subset of primes whose sum is prime. Therefore, we need to ensure that in {1, 2, ..., n}, there are no 10 primes whose sum is prime. Therefore, we need to find the largest n where this is the case. Then, the answer is n. If there exists a 10-element subset of primes with prime sum, then such n is too small, because the problem wants the statement to hold for any 10-number subset, which would include that 10-element subset. Therefore, n must be such that there are no 10-element subsets of primes with prime sum. Hence, the answer is the largest n where this is true. So, we need to find the maximum n where there is no 10 primes in {1, 2, ..., n} whose sum is prime.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the largest n such that in the primes up to n, there is no subset of 10 primes whose sum is prime. Then, the answer is n. So, we need to find the maximum n where this holds. Then, the answer is that n. So, how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, let's note that the sum of 10 primes. Let's think about the possible sums. The sum of 10 primes: if all primes are odd (except 2), then the sum would be even (since 10 is even). If one of them is 2, then the sum is 2 plus the sum of 9 odd primes. The sum of 9 odd primes is odd + 2 = odd + even = odd. So, the total sum is odd. So, if the sum is odd, it can be prime (as in the example above). If the sum is even, then the only even prime is 2, so the sum would be composite. Therefore, the sum is prime only if it is an odd prime. So, the problem is to prevent having a subset of 10 primes (with sum prime). So, we need to ensure that in {1, 2, ..., n}, there is no 10-element subset of primes whose sum is prime.\n\nTherefore, to find the largest n, we need to find the maximum n where every 10-element subset of primes in {1, 2, ..., n} has a sum that is composite. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum n such that there are no 10 primes in {1, 2, ..., n} with sum prime. Therefore, the answer is the maximum n for which this is true. So, our task is to find the largest n where in the set of primes up to n, there is no 10-element subset with prime sum.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about the possible sums. The smallest 10 primes would be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Let's compute their sum. Let's see: 2 + 3 = 5; 5 + 5 = 10; 10 + 7 = 17; 17 + 11 = 28; 28 + 13 = 41; 41 + 17 = 58; 58 + 19 = 77; 77 + 23 = 100; 100 + 29 = 129. So, the sum is 129, which is not prime. Let's check if 129 is prime. 129 divided by 3 is 43, so 3*43=129. Not prime. So, that sum is composite.\n\nAnother example: take the 10 primes starting from 3. Let's add 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31. Let's compute the sum. 3+5=8; 8+7=15; 15+11=26; 26+13=39; 39+17=56; 56+19=75; 75+23=98; 98+29=127; 127+31=158. 158 is even and greater than 2, so composite.\n\nAnother example: take primes starting from 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. Wait, that's the first example, sum 129, which is composite.\n\nWhat if we take primes with one 2? Let's see. Let's take 2, and the primes 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. Wait, that's the first 10 primes. Sum is 129, composite.\n\nWait, but maybe if we take primes all odd. Wait, but 10 primes would have to include 2 to have an odd sum. Wait, the sum of 10 primes: if all are odd, sum is even. If one is 2, sum is odd. So, the only way to get an odd sum is to include 2. Therefore, the sum is prime only if it's an odd prime. Therefore, to have a prime sum, the 10 primes must include 2 and 9 other primes, such that the sum is prime. For example, in the previous example, the sum was 129, which is composite. So, maybe in the primes up to n, there's no such 10-element subset.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the largest n where in any 10-element subset of {1,2,...,n}, either there are two non-primes, or all primes in the subset sum to a prime. So, we need to ensure that there is no 10-element subset of primes whose sum is prime. Therefore, n is the largest number where the primes up to n do not contain such a subset. So, to find the maximum n, we need to check the primes up to n and see if there exists a 10-element subset of primes with prime sum. If such a subset exists, then n is too small. Therefore, the answer is the maximum n where no such subset exists.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum n where in the set {1, 2, ..., n}, there is no subset of 10 primes whose sum is prime.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's first note that if we can find a 10-element subset of primes whose sum is prime, then n must be less than that maximum. Therefore, the answer is the maximum n where such a subset does not exist. Therefore, we need to find the largest n where in the primes up to n, there is no 10-element subset with prime sum.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find the smallest possible sum of 10 primes where the sum is prime, and then set n to be one less than that. But how?\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is not about the minimal sum, but about whether such a subset exists. So, even if there is a 10-element subset with prime sum, as long as n is less than that maximum, then the statement holds. So, the answer is the largest n where there is no 10-element subset of primes with prime sum.\n\nTherefore, to find this n, we need to find the minimal n where such a subset exists. Wait, no. Wait, we need the maximum n where such a subset does not exist. So, n is the largest number where in {1, 2, ..., n}, there is no 10-element subset of primes with prime sum.\n\nTherefore, to find this, we need to find the minimal n where such a subset exists, and then set n to be one less. But how do we find such a minimal n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the sum of 10 primes (each at least 2) is at least 2 + 9*2 = 20 (if we have 10 primes, all 2s). But primes are mostly odd, so the sum would be either even or odd. If we have 10 primes, including 2, then the sum is even + 9 odds. Wait, 2 is even, and 9 odds sum to 9*odd = odd. So, even + odd = odd", "answer": "Ukážeme, že hledané největší \\( n \\) je rovno 21.\n\nNejdříve ověříme, že požadovanou vlastnost nemá žádné přirozené číslo \\( n \\geq 22 \\).

Jinak řečeno, z libovolných čtyř čísel z \\( S \\) je aspoň jedno vybráno.\n\nRozlišíme nyní, které z lichých čísel \\( 1, 9, 15, 21 \\) je vybráno (půjde o diskusi čtyř případů, které se navzájem nemusí nutně vylučovat):\n\n- Vybráno je číslo 1.

The problem is to fill an n x n grid with 0s and 1s so that the sum of each row is divisible by 5 and the sum of each column is divisible by 7. We need to do this for n=9 and n=12. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by understanding what exactly the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, for part a) n=9. So a 9x9 grid. Each row must have a sum divisible by 5, and each column must have a sum divisible by 7. The entries can only be 0s or 1s. Each row has 9 elements, so the possible sums for each row are from 0 to 9. But they need to be divisible by 5, so possible row sums are 0, 5. Similarly, for the columns, each column has 9 elements, so possible sums are 0, 7, 14. But since 14 is more than 9, the column sums can only be 0 or 7.\n\nWait, but 0 is possible for both rows and columns. So, for rows, each row must have either 0 or 5 ones. For columns, each column must have either 0 or 7 ones. Now, the total number of 1s in the grid is the sum of the row sums, which must also equal the sum of the column sums. So, for the grid to be possible, the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 5 (from the rows) and a multiple of 7 (from the columns). Therefore, the total number of 1s must be a common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35. But since the grid is 9x9, which has 81 cells, the total number of 1s can't exceed 81. However, 35 is less than 81, so that's possible. Wait, but 35 is 5*7, so yes, 35 is a multiple of both 5 and 7. So, the total number of 1s would need to be 35. But is that possible?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check. If all rows have sum 5, then total number of 1s is 9*5=45. But 45 is not a multiple of 7, since 45 divided by 7 is about 6.428... So that's a problem. Similarly, if all columns have sum 7, total number of 1s would be 9*7=63, which is also not a multiple of 5. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, we can't have all rows summing to 5 and all columns summing to 7. So, we need a combination where the total number of 1s is a multiple of both 5 and 7, which is 35. So total 1s must be 35. But how can we arrange 35 1s in the grid such that each row sums to 5 and each column sums to 7? Wait, but rows summing to 5 would require 9 entries per row, each being 0 or 1. So each row has exactly 5 ones and 4 zeros. Similarly, each column must have exactly 7 ones and 2 zeros. So total number of ones is 9*5=45 or 9*7=63. But 45 is not 35, and 63 is not 35. So that's a problem. Wait, so maybe my initial thought was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of 1s must be a multiple of both 5 and 7. Since 5 and 7 are coprime, their least common multiple is 35. Therefore, the total number of 1s must be 35. But 35 is less than 45 (9*5) or 63 (9*7), which are the total possible 1s if all rows or columns are all 1s. So how can we have 35 1s in the grid where each row has exactly 5 1s and each column has exactly 7 1s? Because 35 rows (each with 5 1s) would require 35*5=175 1s, but that's impossible. Wait, maybe I confused rows and columns. Wait, the total number of 1s is the sum of the row sums, which is 9 rows each with sum 5, so 9*5=45. Or the sum of the column sums, which is 9 columns each with sum 7, so 9*7=63. But 45 and 63 are different. So, this is impossible. Therefore, there's no such grid for n=9 where all rows sum to 5 and all columns sum to 7. Therefore, we need a different approach.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't say that the rows and columns have to have fixed sums; it just says that each row sum is divisible by 5 and each column sum is divisible by 7. So, rows can have sums 0,5,10,... but since each row has 9 cells, the maximum sum is 9. So possible row sums are 0,5. Similarly, column sums can be 0,7,14, but 14 is too big, so 0 or 7. Therefore, total number of 1s must be a multiple of 5 (from rows) and a multiple of 7 (from columns). Therefore, total number of 1s must be LCM(5,7)=35. So 35 1s in the grid. But how to arrange 35 1s such that each row has 5 or 0 ones, and each column has 7 or 0 ones?\n\nBut 35 is 5*7. So, if we have 5 rows with 7 ones each, but wait, each row can only have up to 5 ones. Wait, no. Wait, each row can have 0 or 5 ones. So if we have k rows with 5 ones, then total 1s would be 5k. Similarly, each column has 0 or 7 ones. So, if we have m columns with 7 ones, total 1s would be 7m. Therefore, 5k = 7m. Since 5 and 7 are coprime, the smallest solution is k=7 and m=5, leading to 35 1s. Therefore, we need 7 rows with 5 ones each and 5 columns with 7 ones each. So, total 1s is 7*5=35. Therefore, such a grid is possible, but how?\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging 35 1s in a 9x9 grid such that exactly 5 rows have 5 ones each and exactly 7 columns have 7 ones each. Therefore, each of the 7 columns must have 7 ones, and each of the 5 rows must have 5 ones. Wait, but each row can have at most 5 ones. So, each of the 7 columns must have 7 ones, spread across the rows. Since each row can have at most 5 ones, then in each row, the remaining 7 - 5 = 2 cells must be zeros. Therefore, each of the 7 columns with 7 ones must have exactly 2 zeros in each of these rows. Wait, but there are 7 columns. Each column needs 7 ones. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and edges represent 1s. Then, we need a bipartite graph with 9 rows and 9 columns, each row node has degree 5 (since each row sum is 5), each column node has degree 7 (since each column sum is 7). But for a bipartite graph, the sum of degrees on each side must be equal. The total degrees for rows would be 9*5=45, and for columns 9*7=63. Wait, 45 ≠ 63, so this is impossible. Therefore, such a bipartite graph cannot exist. Therefore, it's impossible to have a grid where each row sums to 5 and each column sums to 7. Therefore, the total number of 1s must satisfy both conditions, but since 9*5=45 and 9*7=63, which are different, there's no such grid. Therefore, the answer for part a) is no?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"fill an n x n grid with 0s and 1s so that the sum of numbers in each row is divisible by 5 and the sum of numbers in each column is divisible by 7\". So, it's possible that the total number of 1s is not 35, but some multiple of both 5 and 7, but since 5 and 7 are coprime, the LCM is 35. Therefore, the total number of 1s must be 35, but as we saw, the bipartite graph model tells us that this is impossible. Therefore, there is no such grid for n=9. But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, but maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't require that all rows have the same sum and all columns have the same sum, but just that each row sum is divisible by 5 and each column sum is divisible by 7. So, the total number of 1s is the sum of the row sums, which is divisible by 5, and also the sum of the column sums, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, the total number of 1s must be a multiple of both 5 and 7, i.e., 35, 70, 105, etc. But since the grid is 9x9, the maximum number of 1s is 81. So, possible total 1s are 35, 70, 105 (but 105 is too big). So, 35 or 70. Let's check 70 first.\n\nIf total number of 1s is 70, then the average row sum is 70/9 ≈7.777, which is not an integer. But each row sum must be an integer divisible by 5. So possible row sums are 5,10. Similarly, column sums must be 7 or 14, but 14 is too big, so 0 or 7. Wait, but 70 divided by 9 is not an integer. Therefore, it's impossible. Similarly, 35 divided by 9 is not an integer. So, neither 35 nor 70 work. Therefore, there is no possible total number of 1s that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 and also can be achieved by arranging 1s in the grid with row and column sums divisible by 5 and 7 respectively. Therefore, it's impossible for n=9? But that seems strange because the problem is asking to fill the grid, implying that it's possible. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's think again. The problem doesn't say that each row must have the same sum, just that each row sum is divisible by 5, and each column sum is divisible by 7. So, the total number of 1s is the sum of row sums, which must be divisible by 5, and the sum of column sums, which must be divisible by 7. Therefore, the total number of 1s must be a common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35, 70, etc. However, since 35 and 70 are less than or equal to 81 (the maximum possible), but 35 divided by 9 is not an integer, and 70 divided by 9 is not an integer. Therefore, neither 35 nor 70 can be the total number of 1s. Therefore, there is no such grid. Therefore, the answer to part a) is no. But that seems too immediate. Maybe there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't require that the sums are the same for all rows or columns. So, for example, some rows could have sum 5, others 10, and some columns 7, others 14. But 14 is too big for a column of 9 cells. So, columns can only have sums 0 or 7. Similarly, rows can only have sums 0 or 5. Therefore, the total number of 1s must be 5k where k is the number of rows with 5 ones, and 7m where m is the number of columns with 7 ones. Therefore, 5k = 7m. Since 5 and 7 are coprime, the smallest solution is k=7 and m=5, leading to 35 1s. But as we saw, this leads to a contradiction in the bipartite graph model. So, 35 1s is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction, meaning that such a grid cannot exist. Hence, part a) is impossible.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem allows the grid to have different row and column sums as long as each row sum is divisible by 5 and each column sum is divisible by 7. So, perhaps there's another way to arrange the 1s so that the total number of 1s is 70 or 35, but maybe with different distributions. Wait, but 70 divided by 9 is not an integer. 70/9 is approximately 7.777. Similarly, 35/9 is about 3.888. Therefore, neither 35 nor 70 is divisible by 9. Therefore, even if we use a different number of rows and columns with different sums, the total number of 1s would still have to be a multiple of 5 and 7, leading to 35 or 70, which are not divisible by 9. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, part a) is impossible.\n\nBut wait, the problem is in Chinese, and maybe there's a translation error? Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"fill an n x n grid with 0s and 1s so that the sum of the numbers in each row is divisible by 5 and the sum of the numbers in each column is divisible by 7.\" So, each row sum is divisible by 5, each column sum is divisible by 7. So, the total number of 1s must be divisible by both 5 and 7, i.e., 35, 70, etc. But since 35 and 70 are not multiples of 9, such a grid is impossible. Therefore, the answer to part a) is no. But maybe the problem is asking", "answer": "**a)** Dokážeme sporem, že žádné takové vyplnění neexistuje. Předpokládejme opak a uvažme nějaké vyhovující vyplnění tabulky 9 × 9.

Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. We have n > 2, and we need n^{n-2} to be a perfect n-th power. That means there exists some integer k such that n^{n-2} = k^n. So, the question is, for which n > 2 does this equation hold?\n\nLet me rephrase it. If n^{n-2} is a perfect n-th power, then n must satisfy that when you take the n-th root of n^{n-2}, you get an integer. So, mathematically, that would be n^{(n-2)/n} = k. But n is an integer, so (n-2)/n must be an integer exponent that results in an integer when n is raised to that power. Wait, but n and n-2 are integers, so (n-2)/n is a rational number. Wait, but n is an integer greater than 2, so n-2 is a positive integer less than n. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, for n^{(n-2)/n} to be an integer, since n is an integer, we can write this as n^{(n-2)/n} = n^{1 - 2/n} = n / n^{2/n}. So, n divided by n raised to the 2/n power. But n^{2/n} is the same as the n-th root of n squared. So, n divided by n^{2/n} must be an integer. So, that implies that n^{2/n} must be a rational number, because n is an integer, and dividing n by a rational number gives an integer. Wait, but n is an integer greater than 2, so n^{2/n} must be a rational number such that n divided by that rational number is an integer. But n is an integer, so the denominator (n^{2/n}) must divide n exactly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's think about prime factorization. For n^{n-2} to be a perfect n-th power, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of n. Let's consider the prime factors of n. Let n be written as a product of primes: n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak. Then, n^{n-2} = p1^{a1*(n-2)} * p2^{a2*(n-2)} * ... * pk^{ak*(n-2)}. For this to be a perfect n-th power, each exponent ai*(n-2) must be divisible by n. So, for each i, ai*(n-2) ≡ 0 mod n. Which means that ai*(n - 2) ≡ 0 mod n. \n\nSo, for each prime factor pi in n, the exponent ai must satisfy ai ≡ 0 mod n/gcd(n,2). Wait, let me think. Since n and n-2 are integers, but gcd(n, n-2) is gcd(n, 2). Because gcd(n, n-2) = gcd(n, 2). So, if n is even, gcd(n,2) = 2, otherwise gcd(n,2) = 1. \n\nTherefore, if n is even, then ai must be divisible by n/gcd(n,2) = n/2. But since ai is a positive integer (as exponents in prime factors), ai must be divisible by n/2. But ai is an exponent, so it must be at least 1. Therefore, n/2 must be an integer, so n must be even. Therefore, if n is even, then all exponents ai must be divisible by n/2. But n is even, so n/2 is an integer. \n\nOn the other hand, if n is odd, then gcd(n,2) = 1, so the condition becomes ai ≡ 0 mod n. Therefore, each exponent ai must be divisible by n. But since n is the product of primes, and the exponents ai are at least 1, this would require that each ai is at least n. But since n is the product of primes, unless n is 1 or 2, which are not allowed here (n > 2), so n has at least two prime factors. Therefore, if n is odd, the exponents ai would need to be at least n, but n is the product of primes, so unless n is 2, which it's not, the exponents would need to be at least n, which is impossible because the exponents are in the prime factorization. Therefore, for odd n > 2, this condition cannot be satisfied. Hence, n must be even. \n\nWait, but let's check with some examples. Let's take n=4. Then n-2=2. So, n^{n-2}=4^2=16. 16 is 2^4, which is indeed a perfect 4th power (2^4). So, 4 works. \n\nn=6: n-2=4. 6^4=1296. Is 1296 a perfect 6th power? Let's see. 6^6=46656. 1296 is 6^4. Let's compute the 6th root of 1296. 1296^(1/6) = (6^4)^(1/6) = 6^(4/6) = 6^(2/3). Which is not an integer. So 1296 is not a perfect 6th power. Wait, but maybe my calculation is wrong. Wait, 6^4 = 1296. Let's check 6th powers of small integers: 1^6=1, 2^6=64, 3^6=729, 4^6=4096. 1296 is between 4^6=4096 and 3^6=729. So, not a perfect 6th power. Therefore, n=6 doesn't work. Hmm, so my initial thought that n must be even is not sufficient. \n\nWait, but let's take n=8. Then n-2=6. 8^6=262144. Let's compute the 8th root of 262144. 2^24=16777216, which is way bigger. Wait, 8^6=262144. Let's see, 8 is 2^3, so 8^6=2^18. Now, 2^18. To be a perfect 8th power, 2^18 must be equal to (2^k)^8=2^(8k). So, 8k=18? That would require k=18/8=9/4, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2^18 is not a perfect 8th power. So, 8 does not work. \n\nWait, but earlier, n=4 worked. Let's check n=2. But n>2 is required. So n=2 is excluded. Let's try n=8 again. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, 8^6 is 262,144. Let's see 8^6= (8^2)^3=64^3=262,144. Is 262,144 a perfect 8th power? Let's compute 8th roots. 2^1=2, 2^16=65,536; 2^18=262,144. So, it's not a perfect 8th power. So, 8 doesn't work. \n\nWait, so maybe n=4 is the only even number? Let's check n=3, but n>2, so n=3. But n=3 is odd. Then, n^{n-2}=3^1=3. Is 3 a perfect 3rd power? 3 is not a perfect cube. So, no. \n\nn=5: 5^3=125. Is 125 a perfect 5th power? 5^3=125. The 5th root of 125 is 5^(3/5), which is not an integer. So, no. \n\nn=6: As above, 6^4=1296. Not a perfect 6th power. \n\nn=7: 7^5=16807. 16807^(1/7). 7^5=16807, which is 7^5. The 7th root of 7^5 is 7^(5/7), not an integer. So, no. \n\nn=8: As above, no. \n\nn=9: 9^7=4782969. Let's see if this is a perfect 9th power. 9=3^2, so 9^7=3^14. 3^14. The 9th root is 3^(14/9), which is not an integer. So, no. \n\nn=10: 10^8=100,000,000. Is this a perfect 10th power? 10^8. The 10th root of 10^8 is 10^(8/10)=10^(4/5), not an integer. \n\nWait, so maybe n=4 is the only one. Let's check n=16. Wait, n=16: 16^14. Is that a perfect 16th power? 16^14=(2^4)^14=2^56. To be a perfect 16th power, 56 must be divisible by 16? 56 divided by 16 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So, no. \n\nWait, so maybe n=4 is the only even number where n^{n-2} is a perfect n-th power. But let's think again. \n\nEarlier, when we considered the prime factorization, for each prime in the factorization of n, the exponent multiplied by (n-2) must be divisible by n. So, for each prime pi in the factorization, ai*(n-2) ≡ 0 mod n. Therefore, ai*(n - 2) must be a multiple of n. \n\nSince n divides ai*(n - 2), and n and n - 2 may share a common factor. Let's compute gcd(n, n - 2). Let's say d = gcd(n, n - 2). Then, d divides both n and n - 2, so d divides (n - (n - 2)) = 2. Therefore, d is either 1 or 2. \n\nTherefore, if n is even, then d=2. If n is odd, d=1. \n\nTherefore, if n is even, then n = 2k, and d=2. So, the condition becomes for each prime pi in n's prime factorization, ai*(2k - 2) ≡ 0 mod 2k. Wait, no. Wait, n is 2k, so n - 2 = 2k - 2 = 2(k - 1). Therefore, the condition is ai*(2(k - 1)) ≡ 0 mod 2k. Simplify: 2 ai(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod 2k. Divide both sides by 2: ai(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod k. Therefore, ai(k - 1) must be divisible by k. \n\nSince k and k - 1 are coprime (consecutive integers), so k and k - 1 share no common factors. Therefore, k must divide ai. Therefore, each ai must be divisible by k. But ai is the exponent of the prime pi in n's factorization. Therefore, ai must be at least k. But n = 2k, so the exponents ai must be at least k. However, n is the product of primes, so unless n is 2^k, which would require that n has a single prime factor 2 with exponent k. \n\nWait, if n is a power of 2, say n = 2^m, then n - 2 = 2^m - 2. Then, n^{n-2} = (2^m)^{2^m - 2} = 2^{m*(2^m - 2)}. For this to be a perfect n-th power (i.e., 2^m), the exponent m*(2^m - 2) must be divisible by 2^m. So, 2^{m} divides m*(2^m - 2). Let's write this as m*(2^m - 2) ≡ 0 mod 2^m. \n\nDivide both sides by 2: m*(2^{m-1} - 1) ≡ 0 mod 2^{m-1}. So, 2^{m-1} divides m*(2^{m-1} - 1). Since m and 2^{m-1}-1 are coprime? Let's see. If m is even, then 2^{m-1} -1 is odd, so m must be divisible by 2^{m-1}. But m is the exponent, so m >=1. For m=1: 2^{0} -1=0, so 1*0=0, which is divisible by 2^0=1. So, m=1: 2^{1-1}=1 divides 1*(1 -1)=0. So, 1 divides 0, which is true. So, m=1 is possible. But n=2^1=2, which is not allowed since n>2. \n\nFor m=2: 2^{1} -1=1. So, 2 divides 2*1=2, which is true. So, m=2: 2*(2 -2)=0, which is divisible by 2^2=4? Wait, no. Wait, m=2: n=4. Then, n^{n-2}=4^{2}=16=2^4. Which is a perfect 4th power. So, m=2 works. \n\nFor m=3: 2^{2} -1=3. So, 3 divides 3*3=9. 9 mod 3=0, so yes. So, m=3: 3 divides 3*3=9. So, 3 divides 9, which is", "answer": "Středy \\( M_1, M_2 \\) zadaných kružnic \\( k_1 \\), resp. \\( k_2 \\) jsou středy ramen \\( BC \\), resp. \\( AD \\) – viz obrázek.

The equations are:\n\n1. \\( xy + 1 = z^2 \\),\n2. \\( yz + 2 = x^2 \\),\n3. \\( zx + 3 = y^2 \\).\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding what each equation represents. Each equation relates two variables multiplied together and then added to a constant, resulting in the square of the third variable. It seems cyclic, with each equation involving the product of two variables and a square of the third. Maybe there's some symmetry or substitution that can help here.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can try to express each equation in terms of one variable and substitute. Let me see. Let's try to express each variable in terms of another. For example, from the first equation, maybe solve for z^2:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( y^2 = zx + 3 \\).\n\nSo each equation gives a square of one variable in terms of the product of the other two. Maybe I can substitute these into each other.\n\nAlternatively, since each equation has a square, perhaps substituting one into another might lead to a system that can be solved step by step.\n\nLet me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1. But equation 2 is \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\), so maybe express z from equation 2 in terms of x and y, then substitute into equation 1. Let me try that.\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( z = \\frac{x^2 - 2}{y} \\), assuming y ≠ 0. Then substitute into equation 1:\n\n\\( xy + 1 = \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 2}{y} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nHmm, that seems complicated, but let's see. Let's expand the right-hand side:\n\n\\( xy + 1 = \\frac{(x^2 - 2)^2}{y^2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( y^2 \\):\n\n\\( xy^3 + y^2 = (x^2 - 2)^2 \\).\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x and y. Not sure if this is helpful yet. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express each variable in terms of the next. For example, from equation 1, \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\). From equation 2, \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\). From equation 3, \\( y^2 = zx + 3 \\).\n\nIf I can express z from equation 1, then substitute into equation 2, and then express x from equation 2, then substitute into equation 3, maybe we can get an equation in one variable.\n\nBut that might be messy, but let's try.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( z = \\pm \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\). But since we're dealing with real numbers, the expression under the square root must be non-negative. So, \\( xy + 1 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\). So, \\( x^2 - 2 = yz \\). Then, \\( y = \\frac{x^2 - 2}{z} \\).\n\nWait, but z is expressed in terms of x and y from equation 1. This might lead to a loop. Let me try substituting.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y: \\( y = \\frac{x^2 - 2}{z} \\).\n\nThen substitute this into equation 1: \\( z^2 = x \\cdot \\frac{x^2 - 2}{z} + 1 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by z to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\( z^3 = x(x^2 - 2) + z \\).\n\nSo, \\( z^3 - z - x^3 + 2x = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation in z. Not sure if helpful. Maybe another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider adding all three equations:\n\n\\( (xy + 1) + (yz + 2) + (zx + 3) = z^2 + x^2 + y^2 \\).\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\( xy + yz + zx + 6 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\).\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = 6 \\).\n\nNotice that the left side is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2}[(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2] \\). Let me verify:\n\n\\( (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\),\n\n\\( (y - z)^2 = y^2 - 2yz + z^2 \\),\n\n\\( (z - x)^2 = z^2 - 2zx + x^2 \\).\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\( (x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx \\).\n\nSo, \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = \\frac{1}{2}[(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2] \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}[(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2] = 6 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( (x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 12 \\).\n\nInteresting. This equation tells us that the sum of the squares of the differences between each pair of variables is 12. Since all variables are real numbers, each squared term is non-negative, so each difference squared is at least 0, and their sum is 12. So, this might be a key equation to use.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe if we can find integer solutions or some symmetry? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use substitution. Let's try to express each variable in terms of another step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( y^2 = zx + 3 \\).\n\nLet me try to express z from equation 1: \\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\). Then plug into equation 2:\n\n\\( x^2 = y \\cdot \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 2 \\).\n\nHmm, this is still complicated. Let me see if I can find a substitution here.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider multiplying all three equations together. Let's see:\n\nLeft-hand sides: \\( (xy + 1)(yz + 2)(zx + 3) \\).\n\nRight-hand sides: \\( z^2 x^2 y^2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( (xy + 1)(yz + 2)(zx + 3) = (xyz)^2 \\).\n\nBut expanding the left-hand side might be messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide one equation by another to eliminate variables. For example, take equation 1 divided by equation 2:\n\n\\( \\frac{xy + 1}{yz + 2} = \\frac{z^2}{x^2} \\).\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express each variable in terms of another. Let's attempt to express x in terms of y and z from equation 3: \\( y^2 = zx + 3 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{y^2 - 3}{z} \\).\n\nThen substitute into equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\left( \\frac{y^2 - 3}{z} \\right)^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( z^2 \\):\n\n\\( (y^2 - 3)^2 = y z^3 + 2 z^2 \\).\n\nBut z is also related to y via equation 1: \\( z^2 = xy + 1 = x y + 1 \\). But x is expressed in terms of y and z: \\( x = \\frac{y^2 - 3}{z} \\). Therefore, substituting into equation 1:\n\n\\( z^2 = \\left( \\frac{y^2 - 3}{z} \\right) y + 1 = \\frac{y(y^2 - 3)}{z} + 1 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by z:\n\n\\( z^3 = y(y^2 - 3) + z \\).\n\nSo, \\( z^3 - z - y^3 + 3y = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the sum of squares equation we derived earlier:\n\n\\( (x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 12 \\).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 2yz + z^2) + (z^2 - 2zx + x^2) = 12 \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx = 12 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = 6 \\).\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, we have to work with that.\n\nLet me see if we can find a relation between variables. Let's consider subtracting equations.\n\nFor example, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n\\( (xy + 1) - (yz + 2) = z^2 - x^2 \\).\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( xy - yz -1 = z^2 - x^2 \\).\n\nFactor the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (z - x)(z + x) + (xy - yz -1) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, \\( x^2 - xy - yz + z^2 = 1 \\).\n\nWait, maybe factor:\n\n\\( x^2 - xy - yz + z^2 = x(x - y) - z(y - z) \\).\n\nNot sure if helpful. Alternatively, group terms:\n\n\\( x^2 - xy + z^2 - yz = 1 \\).\n\nFactor:\n\n\\( x(x - y) + z(z - y) = 1 \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that since all three equations are cyclic, perhaps there's a symmetric solution where x = y = z. Let's test this.\n\nAssume x = y = z = k. Then substitute into the equations:\n\n1. \\( k^2 + 1 = k^2 \\) ⇒ 1 = 0, which is impossible.\n\nSo, no solution where all variables are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are equal. Let's suppose x = y.\n\nThen, from equation 1: \\( x^2 + 1 = z^2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( x z + 2 = x^2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( x^2 + 3 = x^2 \\) ⇒ 3 = 0, which is impossible. So, x ≠ y.\n\nSimilarly, suppose x = z. Then from equation 3: \\( x^2 + 3 = x^2 \\) ⇒ 3 = 0, impossible. So, x ≠ z.\n\nSimilarly, y = z. Then from equation 2: \\( y^2 + 2 = x^2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( x y + 1 = y^2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( y^2 + 3 = y^2 \\) ⇒ 3 = 0, impossible. So, y ≠ z.\n\nThus, all variables must be distinct. So, no variables equal.\n\nTherefore, we need to find distinct real numbers x, y, z satisfying the system.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of each other step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( y^2 = zx + 3 \\).\n\nLet me try to express z from equation 3 in terms of y and x: \\( z = \\frac{y^2 - 3}{x} \\).\n\nThen substitute this into equation 1:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{y^2 - 3}{x} \\right)^2 = xy + 1 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\( (y^2 - 3)^2 = x^3 y + x^2 \\).\n\nBut from equation 2, \\( x^2 = y z + 2 \\). Substitute z from equation 3:\n\n\\( x^2 = y \\cdot \\frac{y^2 - 3}{x} + 2 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n\\( x^3 = y(y^2 - 3) + 2x \\).\n\nSo, \\( x^3 - 2x = y^3 - 3y \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( y^3 - 3y = x^3 - 2x \\).\n\nSo, \\( y^3 - x^3 - 3y + 2x = 0 \\).\n\nFactor the left-hand side:\n\n\\( (y - x)(y^2 + xy + x^2) - 3(y - x) = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out (y - x):\n\n\\( (y - x)(y^2 + xy + x^2 - 3) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, either \\( y = x \\) or \\( y^2 + xy + x^2 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\nBut we already considered y ≠ x earlier, so the other factor must be zero:\n\n\\( y^2 + xy + x^2 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, equation 4: \\( y^2 + xy + x^2 = 3 \\).\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into the equation we had earlier:\n\nFrom \\( y^3 - 3y = x^3 - 2x \\).\n\nSo, \\( y^3 - x^3 = 3y - 2x \\).\n\nFactor the left-hand side as \\( (y - x)(y^2 + xy + x^2) \\):\n\nBut from equation 4, \\( y^2 + xy + x^2 = 3 \\), so", "answer": "Odečtením druhé rovnice od první a drobnou úpravou dostaneme:  \n\n\\[\ny(x - z) - 1 = (z - x)(z + x),\n\\]\n\\[\n-1 = (z - x)(z + x + y).\n\\]\n\nObdobnou úpravou rozdílu druhé a třetí rovnice získáme:  \n\n\\[\nz(y - x) - 1 = (x - y)(x + y),\n\\]\n\\[\n-1 = (x - y)(x + y + z).\n\\]\n\nZ kterékoliv z obou získaných rovnic plyne \\( x + y + z \\neq 0 \\), takže je můžeme obě výrazem \\( x + y + z \\) vydělit a pak jejich porovnáním dostat:  \n\n\\[\nz - x = \\frac{-1}{x + y + z} = x - y.\n\\]\n\nOznačme \\( d = z - x = x - y \\).

", "response": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths and an integer perimeter of 11990. Additionally, one of the sides is a prime number. We need to find that prime number. Hmm, right-angled triangles with integer sides are called Pythagorean triples. Let me recall some properties of Pythagorean triples.\n\nFirst, Pythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers (a, b, c) such that a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. Since the perimeter is the sum of all three sides, we have a + b + c = 11990. Also, one of the sides is prime. Let's note that in a Pythagorean triple, one of the legs (either a or b) is even, and the other is odd, with the hypotenuse being odd as well. The hypotenuse can be expressed as c = m² + n², where m and n are coprime integers with m > n, and one of them is even. The legs are a = m² - n² and b = 2mn. Alternatively, the legs could be m² - n² and 2mn, but wait, actually, the standard parametrization is a = m² - n², b = 2mn, c = m² + n². But since the hypotenuse is the largest side, c must be the largest. So, depending on m and n, the legs could be a = m² - n², b = 2mn, or vice versa. However, since the perimeter is given, maybe we can use that to find possible values.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 11990, which is an even number. Let's note that in a Pythagorean triple, the sum a + b + c must be even. Since one of the sides is prime, which is an odd number, and the sum is even, the other two sides must add up to an odd number. Therefore, one of the legs must be even (since even + odd + odd = even). But in a Pythagorean triple, one leg is even and the other is odd, and the hypotenuse is odd. So, if one of the sides is prime, that must be the odd one. Wait, but in the standard parametrization, the legs could be even and odd. Wait, perhaps the even leg is one of the legs, and the hypotenuse is odd. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's clarify. In a Pythagorean triple, exactly one of the legs is even, and the hypotenuse is always odd. So, the two legs are one even and one odd. So, if the perimeter is even (11990), then the sum of the two legs (which are one even and one odd) and the hypotenuse (odd) must be even. So, even + odd + odd = even + even = even. So that works. But since the perimeter is even, the sum of all three sides is even. Therefore, the two legs must be one even and one odd, and the hypotenuse is odd. Therefore, if one of the sides is prime, that side must be the odd one (since primes except 2 are odd). But 2 is even, but the other legs are one even and one odd. Wait, but in Pythagorean triples, the even leg is one leg, the other leg is odd, and hypotenuse is odd. So, if one of the sides is prime, that could be the even leg, but that prime would have to be 2 (since the only even prime). So, the prime side could be 2 or the odd leg. But since the perimeter is 11990, which is even, and the sum of the two legs (one even and one odd) plus the hypotenuse (odd) is even. So, the two legs sum to an odd number (since even + odd = odd). Then odd + odd = even. So that works. Therefore, the prime side could be 2 or the odd leg. But 2 is even, so if it's the odd leg, that's a prime. So, the prime side is either 2 or an odd prime. But 2 is the only even prime, so if the perimeter allows, 2 could be one of the legs. Let me check.\n\nWait, but in the parametrization, the even leg is m² - n², which can be even. For example, if m and n are coprime with m > n, and one of them even, then m² - n² would be even. So, the even leg is m² - n². Let me see. For example, take m=2, n=1: a=4-1=3 (odd), b=2*2*1=4 (even), c=5 (odd). So, here the even leg is b=4. Then the perimeter is 3+4+5=12. So in this case, the even leg is 4, which is even, the odd leg is 3, hypotenuse 5. So, in this case, the even leg is 4, which is not prime. So, in the parametrization, the even leg can be even, but it's not necessarily prime. The other sides could be primes. For example, take m=3, n=2: a=9-4=5 (prime), b=2*3*2=12 (even), c=13 (odd). The perimeter is 5+12+13=30. Here, the even leg is 12 (even, not prime), the odd leg is 5 (prime), hypotenuse 13 (prime). So in this case, the odd leg is prime. So maybe in some Pythagorean triples, the odd leg is prime. So, perhaps we need to find such triples where one of the sides (either the even leg, odd leg, or hypotenuse) is prime, and the sum is 11990.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prime side is the even leg. For example, take m=5, n=2: a=25-4=21 (odd), b=2*5*2=20 (even), c=29 (odd). Perimeter is 21+20+29=70. Here, the even leg is 20 (even, not prime), the odd leg is 21 (which is 3*7, not prime), hypotenuse 29 (prime). So in this case, the hypotenuse is prime. So maybe the prime side is the hypotenuse. Alternatively, take m=5, n=4: a=25-16=9 (odd), b=2*5*4=40 (even), c=41 (odd). Perimeter 9+40+41=90. Here, the even leg is 40 (not prime), hypotenuse 41 (prime). So hypotenuse is prime. So, the hypotenuse can be prime. Alternatively, take m=4, n=1: a=16-1=15 (odd), b=8 (even), c=17 (odd). Perimeter 15+8+17=40. Hypotenuse is 17 (prime). So hypotenuse can be prime. Alternatively, m=6, n=1: a=36-1=35 (odd), b=12 (even), c=37 (prime). Perimeter 35+12+37=84. Hypotenuse 37 (prime). So, hypotenuse can be prime. So, perhaps the hypotenuse is often prime. But we also need to check if the legs can be prime. For example, in m=5, n=2: hypotenuse is 29 (prime), but the other legs are 20 and 21. So, 20 is even, 21 is 3*7. So, not prime. Similarly, m=5, n=4: hypotenuse 41 (prime), legs 9 and 40. 9 is 3², 40 is 8*5. So, not primes. So, the legs are not primes, but hypotenuse is prime. So, maybe in some triples, the hypotenuse can be prime. Then, perhaps the prime side is the hypotenuse. Alternatively, if the prime is one of the legs. For example, take m=2, n=1: legs 3 and 4, hypotenuse 5. Here, hypotenuse is 5 (prime). Another example: m=11, n=1: a=121-1=120 (even), b=22 (even), c=121+1=122 (even). Wait, that's all even, which is not a primitive triple. Wait, perhaps m=12, n=1: a=144-1=143 (11²=121, 11*11=121, 12²=144, so 143=11*13, which is composite), b=24 (even), c=145 (odd). Perimeter 143+24+145=312. Here, hypotenuse is 145 (5*29), composite, legs 143 (composite), 24 (composite). So, none are primes here. So, maybe it's hard to find a primitive triple where one of the sides is prime. Since in primitive triples, all sides are coprime. Wait, but maybe there are non-primitive triples? For example, scaling a primitive triple by a factor k. If we take a primitive triple and multiply each side by a prime, we can get a non-primitive triple where the legs or hypotenuse are prime. For example, take the primitive triple (3,4,5), multiply by 2: (6,8,10), but hypotenuse is 10, which is composite. Multiply by 3: (9,12,15), hypotenuse 15, composite. Multiply by 5: (15,20,25), hypotenuse 25, composite. Hmm, maybe scaling doesn't help. Alternatively, take a primitive triple and multiply one leg by a prime. For example, take (3,4,5), multiply 3 by 2: (6,4,5). Wait, but that's not a right triangle. Wait, no, scaling affects all sides. So, scaling a right triangle by a factor k preserves the right angle. So, the sides become k*a, k*b, k*c. So, if (a,b,c) is a right triangle, then scaling by k gives another right triangle. So, if we take a primitive triple and scale it by k, then the sides are k*a, k*b, k*c. So, if k is prime, then k*a and k*b would be composite (since a and b are coprime to k), but k*c would be composite if c is not divisible by k. Wait, but if we choose k such that k*c is prime, then k*c would be prime. So, if we take a primitive triple where c is not divisible by any prime except for primes that divide k. So, for example, take the primitive triple (3,4,5). If we multiply by 2: (6,8,10). Here, hypotenuse is 10, which is composite. If we multiply by 5: (15,20,25). Hypotenuse 25. If we multiply by 7: (21,28,35). Hypotenuse 35. So, none are prime. Alternatively, take a different primitive triple. Let's see, take (5,12,13). Multiply by 2: (10,24,26). Hypotenuse 26. Multiply by 3: (15,36,39). Hypotenuse 39. Multiply by 5: (25,60,65). Hypotenuse 65. Wait, 25 is 5², which is composite. 60 is composite. 65 is 5*13. So, none are primes. Hmm. So maybe scaling a primitive triple doesn't help. So, perhaps the prime side is the hypotenuse, or one of the legs. Wait, but in the examples above, the hypotenuse is either composite or prime. Let's check another triple. Take (7, 24, 25). Hypotenuse 25, which is composite. Multiply by 2: (14, 48, 50). Hypotenuse 50. Multiply by 3: (21, 72, 75). Hypotenuse 75. Multiply by 5: (35, 120, 125). Hypotenuse 125. All composite. Hmm. Maybe the hypotenuse is often composite. So, perhaps the prime side is the even leg. Let's check. Take (3,4,5). The even leg is 4 (composite). Multiply by 3: (9,12,15). Even leg 12 (composite). Multiply by 5: (15,20,25). Even leg 20 (composite). Multiply by 7: (21,28,35). Even leg 28 (composite). Multiply by 11: (33,44,55). Even leg 44 (composite). Multiply by 13: (39,52,65). Even leg 52 (composite). Multiply by 17: (51,68,85). Even leg 68 (composite). Hmm. So, in all these cases, the even leg is composite. So, maybe the even leg can't be prime. Therefore, the only possible prime side is the odd leg or the hypotenuse. But in the examples above, hypotenuse is composite. So, perhaps there is no Pythagorean triple with a prime side? But the problem states that there is such a triangle. So, there must be a prime side, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the prime side is one of the legs, and the other leg is also a prime? But in a Pythagorean triple, if one leg is prime, the other leg and hypotenuse must be such that the other leg squared plus the prime squared equals the hypotenuse squared. Let's suppose that the prime is one of the legs. Let's say a is prime. Then, a² + b² = c². So, b² = c² - a² = (c - a", "answer": "V dotyčném trojúhelníku označme písmenem \\( p \\) prvočíselnou délku jedné odvěsny a písmeny \\( a, \\, b \\) celočíselné délky druhé odvěsny, resp. přepony.  \nRovnost z Pythagorovy věty \\( p^2 + a^2 = b^2 \\) přepíšeme do tvaru  \n\\[\np^2 = b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a).\n\\]\n\nOba činitelé \\( b + a \\) a \\( b - a \\) jsou zřejmě přirozená čísla.

", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many nine-digit numbers there are where each digit from 0 to 9 appears at most once, and the sum of the digits is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Additionally, the number must start with a 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Then, I have to find the smallest and largest such numbers. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the number has to be a nine-digit number, so the first digit can't be 0. The first digit is restricted to 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The other eight digits can be any of the remaining digits (0-9 except the first digit). But each digit from 0-9 can appear at most once. So, since we have nine digits, each digit must appear exactly once? Wait, no. The problem says \"the sum of the digits is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.\" So the total sum is between 1 and 8, inclusive. However, since we have nine digits, each appearing once, the sum would be the sum of all digits from 0-9 minus the sum of the excluded digit. The sum of digits 0-9 is 45. So, if the sum of the digits is S, then the excluded digit is 45 - S. Since S can be 1 to 8, 45 - S would be 44 to 47. But each digit from 0-9 must appear at most once, so 45 - S must be one of the digits. Therefore, 45 - S must be between 0 and 9. Therefore, S can be from 36 to 44 (since 45 - 44 = 1, 45 - 36 = 9). Wait, but the problem states that the sum of the digits is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. So that's a contradiction because if each digit appears exactly once, the sum is 45 minus the excluded digit, which would have to be between 45 - 8 = 37 and 45 - 1 = 44. But the sum needed is between 1 and 8. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem doesn't require each digit to appear exactly once? The problem says \"the sum of the digits is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. a) to 3. a) to 5. b) to 7. c) to 9.\" So, the sum is between 1 and 8, but the digits can repeat? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the sum of the digits is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. a) to 3. a) to 5. b) to 7. c) to 9.\" So, the sum is exactly one of those numbers. But the problem also says \"each digit from 0–9 appears no more than once.\" So, the sum is between 1 and 8, and each digit is used at most once. Therefore, the digits used must be a subset of 0-9 with sum between 1 and 8, and size at most 9 (but since the sum is at least 1, the size is 1 to 8). So, the possible subsets are all combinations of 1 to 8 digits from 0-9, with sum 1 to 8. But the sum of 1 digit: sum is the digit itself, so the digits must be 1, 2, ..., 8. The sum of 2 digits: any two distinct digits from 0-9 that add up to 2 to 8. Similarly for 3 digits, etc., up to 8 digits.\n\nBut wait, the first digit must be one of 1,3,5,7,9, and the rest can be any of the remaining digits, but each digit can appear at most once. So, the first digit is selected from 1,3,5,7,9. Then the remaining eight digits are chosen from the remaining eight digits (since one digit is already used as the first digit). But they can't repeat, so each of the remaining eight digits must be unique and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, the total number of such numbers would be the sum over k=1 to 8 of (number of ways to choose k digits from 0-9, excluding the first digit, such that their sum is exactly S, where S is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and the first digit is one of 1,3,5,7,9). But also, the sum of the digits must be exactly one of 1-8.\n\nWait, but if the first digit is one of 1,3,5,7,9, and the remaining digits are chosen from the remaining digits (excluding the first digit), and each of the remaining digits must be unique and not equal to the first digit. So, for each possible sum S in 1-8, we need to count the number of nine-digit numbers where:\n\n1. First digit is 1,3,5,7,9.\n\n2. The remaining eight digits are a subset of 0-9 excluding the first digit, with the sum of all nine digits equal to S.\n\nBut since the first digit is part of the sum, the sum of the remaining eight digits must be S - first_digit.\n\nTherefore, for each S in 1-8, and for each first_digit in {1,3,5,7,9}, we need to count the number of ways to choose eight distinct digits from the remaining eight digits (excluding first_digit) such that their sum is S - first_digit.\n\nBut S - first_digit can range from (1 - 8) down to (8 - 1). Wait, first_digit is at least 1, so S - first_digit can be as low as 1 - 8 = -7, but since the sum of eight digits can't be negative, S - first_digit must be at least 0. Therefore, S ≥ first_digit. But S can be up to 8. So first_digit can be up to S. Since first_digit is at least 1, S must be at least 1, and first_digit can be from 1 to S. But since first_digit is in {1,3,5,7,9}, and S is in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, the possible first_digits and S pairs are:\n\nFor S=1: first_digit must be 1. Then S - first_digit = 0. So we need eight digits summing to 0, but digits are non-negative integers, so the only way is all zeros. But we need eight distinct digits, which can't include zero because first_digit is 1, so the remaining digits can be 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but we need eight distinct digits summing to 0. The only way is if all eight digits are 0, but we can't have duplicates. Therefore, no such numbers for S=1.\n\nSimilarly, for S=2: first_digit can be 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9. But first_digit must be ≤ S. So first_digit can be 1 or 3 (since 5,7,9 are greater than 2). Wait, first_digit is 1,3,5,7,9. For S=2, first_digit can only be 1, since 3,5,7,9 are larger than 2. So first_digit=1, then S - first_digit=1. So we need eight digits summing to 1, which is impossible because the smallest digit is 0, and we have eight digits. The sum is 1, so one digit is 1 and the rest are 0. But we need eight distinct digits. So, we need eight distinct digits, one of which is 1, and the others are 0. But 0 can appear at most once. So possible digits are 0 and 1, but we need eight distinct digits. That's impossible. Therefore, no such numbers for S=2.\n\nSimilarly, S=3: first_digit can be 1,3,5,7,9. For S=3, first_digit must be ≤3. So first_digit=1 or 3. If first_digit=1, then S - first_digit=2. Need eight digits summing to 2. The possible digits are 0,1,2 (since 3 and above would exceed sum). So digits must include 0,1,2 and the rest 0s. But again, we need eight distinct digits. The only way is 0,1,2, and five 0s. But duplicates are not allowed. So impossible. If first_digit=3, then S - first_digit=0. Again, same problem as S=2. Impossible. So no numbers for S=3.\n\nSimilarly for S=4: first_digit must be ≤4. So first_digit=1,3. If first_digit=1, S - first_digit=3. We need eight digits summing to 3. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Need eight distinct digits summing to 3. This is impossible. If first_digit=3, S - first_digit=1. Again, same problem. Impossible. So no numbers for S=4.\n\nS=5: first_digit must be ≤5. So first_digit=1,3,5. If first_digit=1, S - first_digit=4. Need eight digits summing to 4. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3,4. Need eight distinct digits. The sum is 4, so possible digits: 0,1,2,3,4. But we need eight digits. So missing digits are 5,6,7,8,9. But we can only use each once. The sum would be 0+1+2+3+4 + (5-0) + (6-0) + etc. Wait, no. Wait, if we can only use 0,1,2,3,4 and five others. But the sum is 4. So even if we use 0,1,2,3,4, sum is 10, which is way over. Impossible. Similarly, first_digit=3: S - first_digit=2. Need eight digits summing to 2. Possible digits: 0,1,2. But need eight distinct digits. Impossible. First_digit=5: S - first_digit=0. Again, same problem. So no numbers for S=5.\n\nS=6: first_digit ≤6. So first_digit=1,3,5. If first_digit=1, S - first_digit=5. Need eight digits summing to 5. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3,4. Sum is 10, which is over. If first_digit=3, S - first_digit=3. Need eight digits summing to 3. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Sum is 6, too much. If first_digit=5, S - first_digit=1. Same as before. Impossible. So no numbers for S=6.\n\nS=7: first_digit ≤7. So first_digit=1,3,5,7. Let's check each:\n\nFirst_digit=1: S - first_digit=6. Need eight digits summing to 6. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Sum is 6. So digits are 0,1,2,3. Need eight distinct digits. But we can only use these four digits. Impossible.\n\nFirst_digit=3: S - first_digit=4. Need eight digits summing to 4. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Sum is 6. Too high. Impossible.\n\nFirst_digit=5: S - first_digit=2. Need eight digits summing to 2. Possible digits: 0,1,2. Sum is 3. Too high. Impossible.\n\nFirst_digit=7: S - first_digit=0. Same problem as before. So no numbers for S=7.\n\nS=8: first_digit ≤8. So first_digit=1,3,5. Let's check:\n\nFirst_digit=1: S - first_digit=7. Need eight digits summing to 7. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3,4. Sum is 10. Too high.\n\nFirst_digit=3: S - first_digit=5. Need eight digits summing to 5. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Sum is 6. Too high.\n\nFirst_digit=5: S - first_digit=3. Need eight digits summing to 3. Possible digits: 0,1,2,3. Sum is 6. Too high.\n\nFirst_digit=7: S - first_digit=1. Same as first_digit=7. Impossible.\n\nFirst_digit=9: But 9 is not allowed as first_digit. So no first_digit=9.\n\nSo, for all possible sums S in 1-8, there are no valid nine-digit numbers meeting the criteria. But that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"the sum of the digits is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. a) to 3. a) to 5. b) to 7. c) to 9.\"\n\nAh, maybe the sum is exactly one of those numbers, i.e., either 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, or 8. And the sum is between 1 and 8. So the total sum is one of those numbers. But each digit is used at most once. So the sum of the digits is S, and we have nine digits, each from 0-9, with no repeats. So the sum is the sum of nine distinct digits from 0-9. But the maximum possible sum is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36. But the problem says the sum is between 1 and 8. So the digits used must be a subset of 0-9 with sum S, and the first digit is one of 1,3,5,7,9. Additionally, all digits in the number must be distinct. So, for S=1, the digits must be 0 and eight 1s, but we can't have duplicates. So no.

I need to find the number of real roots of the equation x|x + 6A| = 36, depending on the real parameter A. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky because they split into different cases. Let me start by breaking down the equation.\n\nFirst, the equation is x times the absolute value of (x + 6A) equals 36. So, |x + 6A| is always non-negative, right? And when we multiply it by x, the product is 36. Since 36 is positive, the product x|x + 6A| must also be positive. That means either both x and |x + 6A| are positive, or both are negative. Wait, but if x is negative and |x + 6A| is negative, their product would be positive. But absolute values can't be negative, so |x + 6A| is always non-negative. So, for the product x|x + 6A| to be positive, either both x and |x + 6A| are positive, or x is negative and |x + 6A| is negative. But since |x + 6A| is non-negative, the latter case would require |x + 6A| to be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that both x and |x + 6A| are positive. Therefore, x > 0 and x + 6A > 0. So, in this case, x must be greater than 0, and x must be greater than -6A. So, combining these, x must be greater than the maximum of 0 and -6A. Wait, but since A is a real parameter, 6A can be positive or negative. Let me think.\n\nWait, but if x is greater than 0 and x + 6A > 0, then x must be greater than -6A. So, depending on the value of A, -6A can be positive or negative. Let's consider two cases: when A is positive and when A is negative.\n\nCase 1: A ≥ 0. Then -6A ≤ 0. So, the condition becomes x > 0 and x + 6A > 0. Since A is non-negative, 6A is non-negative, so x + 6A > 0 is equivalent to x > -6A. But since x is already greater than 0, and -6A is non-positive (because A is non-negative), then x > -6A is automatically satisfied because x is positive. So in this case, the equation reduces to x(x + 6A) = 36. Because |x + 6A| is just x + 6A since x + 6A ≥ 0.\n\nSo, in Case 1 (A ≥ 0), the equation is x^2 + 6A x - 36 = 0. Let's solve this quadratic equation. The discriminant D = (6A)^2 + 144 = 36A² + 144. Since 36A² is non-negative and 144 is positive, D is always positive. Therefore, there are two real roots. But we need to check if these roots satisfy the original conditions. Since x > 0 and x + 6A > 0. For A ≥ 0, 6A ≥ 0, so x + 6A > 0 is equivalent to x > -6A. But x > 0 and -6A ≤ 0, so x > -6A is automatically true. Therefore, both roots must be positive. Let's compute the roots:\n\nx = [-6A ± sqrt(36A² + 144)] / 2 = [-6A ± 6sqrt(A² + 4)] / 2 = [-3A ± 3sqrt(A² + 4)].\n\nSo, the two roots are x = -3A + 3sqrt(A² + 4) and x = -3A - 3sqrt(A² + 4). Let's check if these are positive.\n\nFor the first root: x = -3A + 3sqrt(A² + 4). Since sqrt(A² + 4) > |A|, then -3A + 3sqrt(A² + 4). If A ≥ 0, then -3A is negative, but 3sqrt(A² + 4) is positive. Let's see if this is positive. Let's compute:\n\nsqrt(A² + 4) = sqrt(A² + 4). Let's compare with |A|. Since sqrt(A² + 4) ≥ sqrt(A²) = |A|. So, 3sqrt(A² + 4) ≥ 3|A|. Then, -3A + 3sqrt(A² + 4) ≥ -3A + 3|A|. If A is positive, then |A| = A, so this becomes -3A + 3A = 0. Wait, but sqrt(A² + 4) is actually greater than sqrt(A²) = |A|. So, 3sqrt(A² + 4) > 3|A|. Therefore, -3A + 3sqrt(A² + 4) > -3A + 3A = 0. Therefore, the first root is positive. The second root is x = -3A - 3sqrt(A² + 4). Since both terms are negative (A is non-negative, so -3A is negative, and 3sqrt(A² +4) is positive). Wait, no: sqrt(A² +4) is greater than |A|, but since A is non-negative, |A| = A. So, -3A -3sqrt(A² +4) is definitely negative. So, the second root is negative, which contradicts the requirement that x > 0. Therefore, in Case 1 (A ≥ 0), only the first root is positive, so we have one real root.\n\nWait, but let's verify this with an example. Let A = 0. Then the equation becomes x|x| = 36. So, x² = 36, so x = ±6. But x must be positive because A = 0, so x > 0 and x + 6A = x > 0. Therefore, x = 6. But according to our previous analysis, in Case 1, only x = -3*0 + 3sqrt(0 + 4) = 3*2 = 6, which is correct. The other root would be x = -3*0 -3*2 = -6, which is negative, so rejected. So, indeed, only one root. So, in Case 1 (A ≥ 0), we have one real root.\n\nCase 2: A < 0. Then -6A > 0. So, the conditions are x > 0 (since x must be positive) and x + 6A > 0. So, x must be greater than -6A. Since A is negative, -6A is positive. Therefore, x must be greater than -6A. So, combining x > 0 and x > -6A, but since -6A is positive, the stricter condition is x > -6A. So, combining x > 0 and x > -6A, which is equivalent to x > max(0, -6A). But since -6A is positive here, the condition is x > -6A. So, in this case, the equation becomes x(x + 6A) = 36. Wait, same as Case 1? Wait, no. Wait, if A < 0, then 6A is negative, so |x + 6A| is |x + (negative)|. Wait, is x + 6A positive here? Wait, if A is negative, then 6A is negative. So, x + 6A. Since x > -6A (which is positive), x + 6A = x - |6A|. So, depending on whether x is greater than |6A| or not. Wait, but x > -6A is equivalent to x > |6A| because A is negative. So, x > |6A|. Therefore, x + 6A = x - |6A|. So, if x > |6A|, then x + 6A = x - |6A| is positive. Therefore, |x + 6A| = x - |6A| = x + 6A. So, in this case, the equation is x(x + 6A) = 36. So, same as Case 1. Wait, so whether A is positive or negative, if we have x > 0 and x + 6A > 0, then since x > 0 and |x + 6A| is |x + 6A| which is x + 6A when x + 6A ≥ 0, but x + 6A = x - |6A| if A is negative. Wait, but if A is negative, then 6A is negative, so x + 6A is x - |6A|. So, for x > |6A|, x + 6A is positive. So, in this case, |x + 6A| = x + 6A, so the equation becomes x(x + 6A) = 36, same as Case 1. Therefore, in both cases, whether A is positive or negative, the equation reduces to x² + 6A x - 36 = 0. Therefore, the quadratic equation is the same in both cases. So, regardless of A being positive or negative, the equation is x² + 6A x - 36 = 0.\n\nBut wait, in Case 1, when A is positive, we found that there's one positive root. In Case 2, when A is negative, let's see. Let's take A = -1. Then the equation is x|x - 6| = 36. Let's solve this. So, x must be > 0, and x - 6 must be > 0? Wait, no. Wait, |x + 6A|. If A is -1, then 6A is -6, so |x - 6|. So, the equation is x|x - 6| = 36. Let's solve this. So, x|x - 6| = 36. Let's consider two cases for x|x - 6|. But here, since the equation is x|x - 6| = 36, which is similar to the previous cases. Wait, but in the previous analysis, when we split the original equation into x and |x + 6A|, but here, since A is negative, 6A is negative, so |x + 6A| is |x - 6|. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, regardless of A's sign, the original equation is x|x + 6A| = 36. So, when A is negative, 6A is negative, so |x + 6A| is |x - (-6A)|. Wait, no. Let's take A = -1, then 6A = -6, so x + 6A = x - 6. Therefore, |x + 6A| = |x - 6|. So, the equation becomes x|x - 6| = 36. Now, solving this. Let's consider two cases: x - 6 ≥ 0 and x - 6 < 0.\n\nCase 1: x ≥ 6. Then |x - 6| = x - 6, so the equation becomes x(x - 6) = 36, which is x² - 6x - 36 = 0. The discriminant is 36 + 144 = 180. So sqrt(180) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, roots are [6 ± 6sqrt(5)] / 2 = 3 ± 3sqrt(5). Since x ≥ 6, we check which roots are ≥ 6. 3 + 3sqrt(5) ≈ 3 + 6.7 ≈ 9.7, which is ≥6. The other root is 3 - 3sqrt(5) ≈ negative, so discarded. So, one solution here: x ≈9.7.\n\nCase 2: x < 6. Then |x - 6| = 6 - x, so the equation becomes x(6 - x) = 36, which is -x² + 6x - 36 = 0, or x² -6x +36 =0. The discriminant is 36 - 144 = -108 <0, so no real roots here.\n\nTherefore, when A = -1, we have one real root. Similarly, for other negative A, maybe one real root. Wait, but let's check another A. Let's take A = -2. Then 6A = -12, so |x + 6A| = |x -12|. Then the equation is x|x -12| = 36. Solving similar to above:\n\nCase 1: x ≥12. Then |x -12| = x -12, equation becomes x(x -12) =36 → x² -12x -36 =0. Discriminant 144 +144=288, sqrt(288)=12*sqrt(2). Roots: [12 ±12sqrt(2)]/2 =6 ±6sqrt(2). Both roots are positive, but we need x ≥12. 6 +6sqrt(2)≈6 +8.485≈14.485≥12, which is okay. 6 -6sqrt(2)≈negative. So, one solution here: x≈14.485.\n\nCase2: x <12. Then |x -12|=12 -x, equation becomes x(12 -x)=36 → -x² +12x -36=0 →x² -12x +36=0. Discriminant 144 -144=0 → double root x=6. So, x=6. But x must be <12, which it is, and x>0. So, check if x=6 satisfies the original equation: 6|6 +6*(-2)|=6|6 -12|=6*6=36. Yes, correct. So, x=6 is a solution here. Therefore, in this case, we have two solutions: x≈14.485 and x=6. So, total two real roots.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, when A is negative, perhaps there are two roots? Wait, but in the specific case when A = -2,", "answer": "ŘEŠENÍ. Popíšeme nejprve, jak získat graf funkce \\( f(x) = x|x+6A| \\) z grafu kvadratické funkce \\( g(x) = x(x+6A) \\).

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a quadruple (a, b, c, d) where each of a, b, c, d is a two-digit natural number. All four numbers must be distinct. The three conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80.\n2. The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 3 is 90.\n3. The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 5 is 60.\n\nEach of these sums is for the numbers in the quadruple that include the respective digit. So, for example, if a number contains the digit 2, we add its value to the first sum (which should equal 80), and similarly for the other conditions.\n\nSince all numbers are two-digit natural numbers, each number can be represented as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. The digits x and y can range from 0 to 9, but since they're two-digit numbers, x can't be 0. So x is 1-9 and y is 0-9.\n\nNow, each of a, b, c, d is two-digit, so each can be written as x_i * 10 + y_i, where x_i is the tens digit (1-9) and y_i is the units digit (0-9). All four numbers must be distinct, so no two numbers can have the same tens or units digit, but since they are distinct numbers, even if the tens digits are same, the units digits must be different.\n\nBut wait, actually, two numbers can have the same tens digit but different units digits, and vice versa. So, for example, 12 and 13 are distinct even though they have the same tens digit. But if two numbers have the same units digit, like 12 and 13, their units digits are different, but the tens digits are different as well. Wait, actually, no. If two numbers have the same units digit, but different tens digits, they are distinct numbers. For example, 12 and 22. Both have units digit 2, but different tens digits. So, in that case, a number can have the same units digit as another number but different tens digits, so they are still distinct. Similarly, a number can have the same tens digit as another but different units digits.\n\nSo, the key point is that all four numbers are distinct, so even if two numbers have the same tens digit, as long as their units digits are different, they are distinct. Similarly, two numbers can have the same units digit but different tens digits and still be distinct. So, the digits in each position (tens and units) can be the same or different, as long as the actual numbers are different.\n\nBut when considering the digits in the conditions (digits 2, 3, 5), we need to check for each number whether it contains that digit in the respective position. For example, if a number is 23, it contains digit 2 in the tens place. If a number is 32, it contains digit 3 in the tens place. If a number is 52, it contains digit 5 in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each number in the quadruple, we need to check whether it has a 2, 3, or 5 in the tens or units digit, depending on which condition it's contributing to.\n\nBut the problem states that the sum of the numbers that have a 2 in the first condition. So, if a number has a 2 in the tens place, it contributes to the sum. Similarly, if a number has a 2 in the units place, it also contributes to the sum. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\n(i) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80.\n\nSo, the numbers that contain the digit 2 in any position (tens or units) are added together to get 80. Similarly for the other conditions.\n\nTherefore, each number in the quadruple can contribute to one of the sums (if it contains a 2 in any digit), or not contribute to any of the sums. The total sum for the numbers containing 2 is 80. Similarly for 3 and 5 with 90 and 60 respectively.\n\nWait, but each number can contribute to multiple sums. For example, if a number has both a 2 and a 3 in different positions, then it would contribute to both sums. But the problem states that the sums are for numbers containing the digit 2, 3, or 5, each in their respective positions. Wait, no, the problem says:\n\n(i) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80.\n\n(ii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 3 is 90.\n\n(iii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 5 is 60.\n\nSo, each sum is for numbers that include the digit 2 in the first condition, 3 in the second, and 5 in the third. So, each number can be in multiple sums if it contains more than one of these digits. But since the problem specifies that the sums are for numbers containing the digit 2, 3, or 5 in their respective positions, each number can be in 0 to 3 of these sums.\n\nBut since the problem asks for quadruples where all four numbers are distinct, and we need to find all such quadruples, each number must have at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in their respective positions. Wait, no. The problem doesn't specify that the numbers must contain at least one of these digits. It just says \"the sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80,\" etc. So, does that mean that the numbers must contain the digit 2 in the tens place for the first condition, the digit 3 in the tens place for the second, and the digit 5 in the tens place for the third? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\n(i) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80.\n\n(ii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 3 is 90.\n\n(iii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 5 is 60.\n\nSo, the numbers in the quadruple are two-digit numbers. Each number can be in one or more of these sums, depending on whether they contain 2, 3, or 5 in any digit. For example, a number like 23 would contain a 2 in the tens place, so it would contribute to the first sum. It also contains a 3 in the units place, so it would contribute to the second sum. Similarly, a number like 52 would contain a 5 in the tens place, contributing to the third sum. A number like 55 would contain a 5 in both tens and units, so it would contribute to both the second and third sums. However, such a number would also contain a 5 in the units place, so it might contribute to the third sum if that's one of the sums being considered. Wait, but the problem says \"the sum of the numbers that contain the digit 5 is 60.\" So, does that mean the numbers that contain 5 in the tens place, or in any digit? The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let's parse the wording again:\n\n(i) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 2 is 80.\n\n(ii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 3 is 90.\n\n(iii) The sum of the numbers that contain the digit 5 is 60.\n\nSo, the wording is a bit unclear. Does \"contain the digit 2\" mean that the number has a 2 in the tens place? Or does it mean that the number has a 2 in any position (tens or units)? The wording is ambiguous. However, in standard terminology, when we say \"a number contains a digit X,\" it usually means that the number has X in any position. For example, if a number is 23, it contains the digit 2, even though it's in the tens place. Similarly, a number like 32 contains a 3 in the tens place. So, the sums are for numbers that contain 2 in any digit, 3 in any digit, and 5 in any digit, each corresponding to their respective sums.\n\nTherefore, each number can be in 0 to 3 of these sums. However, the problem is to find quadruples where all four numbers are distinct, and each number is part of at least one of the sums (since otherwise, their sum would be zero, but the sums are 80, 90, 60, which are positive). Therefore, each number in the quadruple must contain at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in any position (tens or units), so that they contribute to at least one of the sums.\n\nTherefore, each number in the quadruple must have either a 2, 3, or 5 in the tens or units place, but not necessarily all three. However, if a number has, say, a 2 in the tens place, it contributes to the first sum, but if it doesn't have a 5 in any digit, it might not contribute to the third sum. So, the quadruple must consist of numbers that each have at least one digit (2, 3, or 5) in any position (tens or units), otherwise their respective sums would be zero.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all such quadruples where all four numbers are distinct. So, each number is a two-digit distinct number, and each is in at least one of the sums. So, each number in the quadruple must have at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in any position.\n\nWait, but maybe some numbers don't have any of these digits. For example, a number like 11 would have neither 2, 3, nor 5 in any digit, so it wouldn't contribute to any of the sums, and hence the problem would have no solution. But the problem is asking to find all such quadruples, so there must be solutions. Therefore, perhaps all four numbers must contain at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5, but maybe not all three. So, each number in the quadruple must have at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in any position (tens or units).\n\nTherefore, the first step is to model the numbers as two-digit numbers with digits x and y, where x is from 1-9, y is from 0-9, and the number is 10x + y. Each of the four numbers in the quadruple must be distinct, and each must have at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in x or y (i.e., in the tens or units place).\n\nNow, the sums are:\n\n(i) Sum of numbers containing 2 in any digit: 80.\n\n(ii) Sum of numbers containing 3 in any digit: 90.\n\n(iii) Sum of numbers containing 5 in any digit: 60.\n\nSo, each number in the quadruple can be part of one or more of these sums. For example, a number containing a 2 in the tens place would be in sum (i), and if it also contains a 3 in the units place, then it would be in both sums (i) and (ii). Similarly, a number containing a 5 in the tens place would be in sum (iii), and if it also has a 2 or 3 in the units place, it would be in those sums as well.\n\nBut since the problem is to find all quadruples where all four numbers are distinct, we need to find four distinct numbers (each with at least one of the digits 2, 3, 5) such that the sum of numbers in the first sum is 80, the sum in the second is 90, and the sum in the third is 60.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let's try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that all four numbers must be distinct two-digit natural numbers. So, each number is unique.\n\nAlso, each number must contain at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5. So, numbers like 11, 44, 77, 99, etc., are excluded.\n\nGiven that, let's think about how to model the possible digits in each position (tens and units) for each number.\n\nSince the numbers are distinct, their tens and units digits cannot repeat in such a way that two numbers would have the same tens or units digit, but since two numbers can share the same tens digit as long as their units digits are different, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but actually, two numbers cannot have the same tens digit if they are to be distinct? Wait, no. For example, 12 and 13 are distinct even though they have the same tens digit. So, the tens digits can repeat, as long as the units digits differ. Similarly, units digits can repeat as long as tens digits differ.\n\nTherefore, the tens digits can be from 1-9, and the units digits from 0-9, with the constraint that all four numbers have at least one digit from 2, 3, or 5, and all are distinct.\n\nBut how do we approach building such numbers?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as variables for the tens and units digits of each number, ensuring that all four numbers are distinct, and that their sums meet the required totals.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Each number is a two-digit number, so it can be represented as (t, u), where t is the tens digit (1-9) and u is the units digit (0-9).\n\n2. Each of the four numbers must have at least one of the digits 2, 3, or 5 in t or u. So, for each number, either t=2, t=3, t=5, u=2, u=3, or u=5. But not necessarily all three.\n\n3. The sum of all numbers that have a 2 in t or u is 80.\n\n4. The sum of all numbers that have a 3 in t or u is 90.\n\n5. The sum of all numbers that have a 5 in t or u is 60.\n\nTherefore, we need to assign to each of the four numbers a combination of digits (t, u) such that:\n\n- Each number has at least one of 2,3,5.\n\n- The sum of all numbers with a 2 in t or u is 80.\n\n- The sum with a 3 is 90.\n\n- The sum with a 5 is 60.\n\n- All four numbers are distinct.\n\nSo, the problem is to find all such quadruples of distinct numbers (t, u) satisfying these conditions.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations with constraints.\n\nLet me think about", "answer": "V dotyčném trojúhelníku označme písmenem \\( p \\) prvočíselnou délku jedné odvěsny a písmeny \\( a, \\, b \\) celočíselné délky druhé odvěsny, resp. přepony.  \nRovnost z Pythagorovy věty \\( p^2 + a^2 = b^2 \\) přepíšeme do tvaru  \n\\[\np^2 = b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a).\n\\]\n\nOba činitelé \\( b + a \\) a \\( b - a \\) jsou zřejmě přirozená čísla.

It seems a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. The goal is to prove that the ratio of the areas of two triangles—AEGD and ABC—is a constant, regardless of where points D, E, F, G are located on the sides of triangle ABC. The key here is probably using coordinate geometry or vector analysis to express the positions of these points and then compute the areas. Let me start by visualizing the problem.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again to make sure I understand all the points:\n\n- On side BC of triangle ABC, we have points D and E such that BD = DE = EC. So BC is divided into three equal parts. That means BD:DE:EC = 1:1:1. Therefore, D is 1/3 from B to C, and E is 2/3 from B to C.\n\n- On side AC of triangle ABC, we have points F and G such that AG = GF = FC. So AC is divided into three equal parts. Therefore, AG:GF:FC = 1:1:1, so F is 1/3 from A to C, and G is 2/3 from A to C.\n\n- Then, we're looking at the triangle formed by the lines AE, GD, BF. So these three lines intersect each other to form a smaller triangle inside ABC.\n\n- We need to show that the area of this smaller triangle (AEGD) compared to the area of ABC is a constant value, regardless of where D, E, F, G are located on their respective sides. The problem says \"one unique value,\" so this ratio should be the same no matter the positions of D, E, F, G.\n\nHmm. Since the problem doesn't specify the type of triangle ABC, the ratio should hold for any triangle. Therefore, coordinate geometry might be the way to go because we can assign coordinates to ABC and then compute everything algebraically.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's place triangle ABC in the plane with coordinates. To make things simple, let's assign coordinates to the vertices:\n\n- Let’s set point A at (0, 0), B at (3, 0), and C at (0, 3). This makes ABC a right-angled triangle for simplicity, but since the ratio should hold for any triangle, this should not affect the generality. Wait, but maybe choosing coordinates like this might complicate things if the triangle isn't right-angled. Alternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates or parametrize the sides?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about ratios, perhaps using vectors or affine transformations might be better, but coordinate geometry might be straightforward.\n\nWait, but using coordinate geometry, if I assign coordinates to ABC, then I can compute coordinates of D, E, F, G, then find the equations of lines AE, GD, BF, find their intersection points, compute the area of the inner triangle, and then compute the ratio.\n\nYes, that seems feasible. Let me proceed with coordinates.\n\nLet’s assign coordinates:\n\nLet’s let point A be at (0, 0), point B at (3, 0), and point C at (0, 3). Then, the sides:\n\n- BC goes from (3, 0) to (0, 3). The points D and E divide BC into three equal parts. So BD = DE = EC.\n\nThe parametric equation for BC can be parameterized. Let’s parametrize BC from B (3,0) to C (0,3). The vector from B to C is (-3, 3). So each third of BC is a vector of (-1, 1). Therefore, starting at B (3,0):\n\n- D is 1/3 of the way from B to C: (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1)\n\n- E is 2/3 of the way from B to C: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2)\n\nSimilarly, on AC, points F and G divide AC into three equal parts. AC goes from A (0,0) to C (0,3). The vector from A to C is (0,3). So each third is (0,1). Starting at A (0,0):\n\n- F is 1/3 of the way from A to C: (0, 0 + 1) = (0,1)\n\n- G is 2/3 of the way from A to C: (0, 0 + 2) = (0,2)\n\nNow, we need to find the lines AE, GD, BF and their intersection points to form the inner triangle.\n\nFirst, let's find the equations of these lines.\n\n1. Line AE: connects A (0,0) to E (1,2). The slope is (2 - 0)/(1 - 0) = 2. So the equation is y = 2x.\n\n2. Line GD: connects G (0,2) to D (2,1). The slope is (1 - 2)/(2 - 0) = (-1)/2 = -1/2. The equation can be written using point-slope form from G (0,2):\n\ny - 2 = (-1/2)(x - 0) => y = (-1/2)x + 2.\n\n3. Line BF: connects B (3,0) to F (0,1). The slope is (1 - 0)/(0 - 3) = 1/(-3) = -1/3. Using point B (3,0):\n\ny - 0 = (-1/3)(x - 3) => y = (-1/3)x + 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these three lines to form the triangle AEGD.\n\nWait, hold on. The inner triangle is formed by the intersections of AE, GD, and BF. So we need to find where AE intersects GD, GD intersects BF, and BF intersects AE. Then those three intersection points form the vertices of the inner triangle.\n\nLet me compute these intersections.\n\nFirst, intersection of AE and GD:\n\nAE: y = 2x\n\nGD: y = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nSet 2x = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction:\n\n4x = -x + 4\n\n4x + x = 4 => 5x = 4 => x = 4/5\n\nThen y = 2*(4/5) = 8/5\n\nSo intersection point P is (4/5, 8/5)\n\nSecond, intersection of GD and BF:\n\nGD: y = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nBF: y = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nSet (-1/2)x + 2 = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-3x + 12 = -2x + 6\n\n-3x + 12 + 2x - 6 = 0 => -x + 6 = 0 => x = 6\n\nThen y = (-1/3)(6) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1\n\nWait, but this is (-6/3 + 1)? Wait, no:\n\nWait, substituting x = 6 into BF's equation:\n\ny = (-1/3)(6) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1. So point Q is (6, -1). But that's outside of triangle ABC, which has vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (0,3). So (6, -1) is outside. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's check again.\n\nIntersection of GD and BF:\n\nGD: y = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nBF: y = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\n(-1/2)x + 2 = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n-3x + 12 = -2x + 6\n\nBring variables to left and constants to right:\n\n-3x + 2x = 6 - 12\n\n-x = -6\n\nx = 6\n\nThen y = (-1/3)(6) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1\n\nHmm, that's (6, -1). That's outside the triangle. But the problem states that the inner triangle is formed by lines AE, GD, BF. If two of the intersection points are on the extensions of the sides, then the inner triangle might not be entirely inside ABC. Wait, but maybe in this coordinate system, the lines AE, GD, BF intersect each other outside of ABC, but the inner triangle is still inside ABC? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the parametrization of the points D, E, F, G.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the coordinates of D, E, F, G.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with A(0,0), B(3,0), C(0,3). BC is from (3,0) to (0,3). Dividing BC into three equal parts. Let me parametrize BC parametrically from B to C.\n\nThe vector from B to C is (-3,3). So each step is (-1,1). Therefore:\n\n- D is 1/3 from B: (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2,1)\n\n- E is 2/3 from B: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1,2)\n\nBut in this coordinate system, point E is (1,2), which is on BC. Similarly, AC is from A(0,0) to C(0,3). Dividing into three equal parts:\n\n- F is 1/3 from A: (0,0 + 1) = (0,1)\n\n- G is 2/3 from A: (0,0 + 2) = (0,2)\n\nSo lines AE: from A(0,0) to E(1,2). That's correct. GD: from G(0,2) to D(2,1). BF: from B(3,0) to F(0,1). That's correct.\n\nSo the lines are correctly defined. Then, their intersections are at (4/5,8/5) and (6,-1). But (6,-1) is outside the triangle. So the inner triangle is formed by the intersection of AE and GD (which is inside ABC), and the intersection of GD and BF (outside ABC), and the intersection of BF and AE (inside ABC). Wait, but two of the intersection points are outside ABC? Then the inner triangle would have two vertices inside and one outside? That doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the lines AE and GD intersect inside ABC, GD and BF intersect outside, and BF and AE intersect inside ABC, so the inner triangle is the one formed by these three intersections. But the problem says the triangle is formed by the lines AE, GD, BF. So maybe the triangle is the one formed by the three lines, even if some intersections are outside. But in that case, how do we get the area? The problem states \"the triangle formed by the lines AE, GD, BF\". So maybe it's the triangle whose vertices are the three intersection points of the lines. But if two of them are outside ABC, then the triangle would have one vertex inside and two outside. But the problem states the area ratio, so maybe my coordinate system is causing this. Maybe I need to re-examine the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this coordinate system, the inner triangle is actually formed by the three lines, but their intersections are the three vertices. However, in this case, two intersections are outside, so the triangle is actually not entirely inside ABC. Therefore, maybe my coordinate system is not suitable, or perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's compute the intersection points again.\n\nFirst, intersection of AE and GD:\n\nAE: y = 2x\n\nGD: y = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nSet 2x = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 4x = -x + 4\n\n5x = 4 => x = 4/5, y = 8/5. So (4/5, 8/5). That's inside ABC.\n\nSecond, intersection of GD and BF:\n\nGD: y = (-1/2)x + 2\n\nBF: y = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\n(-1/2)x + 2 = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nSubtract (-1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(-1/2 + 1/3)x + 2 = 1\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n(-3/6 + 2/6)x + 2 = 1 => (-1/6)x + 2 = 1\n\nSubtract 2:\n\n(-1/6)x = -1 => x = 6\n\nThen y = (-1/3)(6) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1. So (6, -1). That's outside ABC.\n\nThird, intersection of BF and AE:\n\nBF: y = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nAE: y = 2x\n\nSet equal:\n\n2x = (-1/3)x + 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n6x = -x + 3\n\n7x = 3 => x = 3/7\n\nThen y = 2*(3/7) = 6/7. So point (3/7, 6/7). That's inside ABC.\n\nSo the three intersection points are:\n\n1. (4/5, 8/5) inside ABC\n\n2. (6, -1) outside ABC\n\n3. (3/7, 6/7) inside ABC\n\nWait, so the triangle formed by these three lines would have two vertices inside ABC and one outside. But the problem states \"the triangle formed by the lines AE, GD, BF\". If the lines are AE, GD, BF, then their intersections are (4/5,8/5), (6,-1), and (3/7,6/7). But the triangle would have vertices at these three points. However, since two of them are outside ABC, the triangle is not entirely inside ABC. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have a different configuration, or perhaps my coordinate system is not suitable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is supposed to be formed by the three lines, even if some intersections are outside. But how can we compute the area then? The problem says \"the triangle formed by the lines AE, GD, BF\". So perhaps it's the triangle whose vertices are the three intersection points, even if some are outside. But in that case, the area would be the absolute value of the determinant, possibly negative, but since area is positive, we take the absolute value. However, the problem specifies that the ratio of the areas is a constant. If two intersection points are outside, then the area might not be positive,", "answer": "Vrcholy vymezeného trojúhelníku označme \\(P, Q, R\\) jako na obrázku.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by simplifying the given equation. Maybe expanding the terms will help. Let me write out the equation again:\n\n(a² - b²)(c² - d²) + (b² - d²)(c² - a²) = 2021.\n\nLet me expand each product separately. Starting with the first term: (a² - b²)(c² - d²). Expanding this, we get:\n\na²c² - a²d² - b²c² + b²d².\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (b² - d²)(c² - a²). Expanding this:\n\nb²c² - b²a² - d²c² + d²a².\n\nNow, let's combine both expanded terms:\n\nFirst term: a²c² - a²d² - b²c² + b²d²\n\nSecond term: b²c² - b²a² - d²c² + d²a²\n\nAdding these together:\n\na²c² - a²d² - b²c² + b²d² + b²c² - b²a² - d²c² + d²a².\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\n- a²c² + a²c² = 0\n\n- a²d² remains\n\n- b²c² - b²c² = 0\n\n- b²d² remains\n\n- d²a² remains\n\n- b²a² remains\n\n- d²c² remains\n\nSo, simplifying all terms:\n\n- a²d² - b²a² + d²a² + b²d² - d²c² + c²d²\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the combination. Let me check again. Let me list all terms:\n\nFrom the first expansion:\n\n+a²c², -a²d², -b²c², +b²d²\n\nFrom the second expansion:\n\n+b²c², -b²a², -d²c², +d²a²\n\nSo adding them:\n\n+a²c² - a²d² - b²c² + b²d² + b²c² - b²a² - d²c² + d²a²\n\nNow, let's combine terms:\n\na²c² (from first expansion) + (-a²d²) + (-b²c² + b²c²) + b²d² + (-b²a²) + (-d²c²) + d²a².\n\nSo, -b²c² and +b²c² cancel out. Similarly, -a²d² and +d²a² are the same. Then we have:\n\na²c² - a²d² + b²d² - b²a² - d²c².\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's rearrange terms:\n\na²c² - a²d² - b²a² + b²d² - d²c² + d²a².\n\nWait, maybe grouping terms differently:\n\n(a²c² - d²c²) + (-a²d² + d²a²) + (b²d² - b²a²)\n\nBut a²c² - d²c² = c²(a² - d²)\n\n-d²a² + d²a² = 0\n\nb²d² - b²a² = b²(d² - a²)\n\nSo combining all:\n\nc²(a² - d²) + 0 + b²(d² - a²) = c²(a² - d²) - b²(a² - d²) = (a² - d²)(c² - b²)\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the entire expression simplifies to (a² - d²)(c² - b²). So the original equation simplifies to:\n\n(a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021.\n\nSo, the equation reduces to (a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021.\n\nNow, since a, b, c, d are positive integers, the terms (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) must be integers as well. Also, since the product is 2021, which is a positive integer, both factors must be positive or both negative. However, since a, d, b, c are positive integers, let's consider possible cases.\n\nFirst, note that a² - d² and c² - b² must be positive integers. Because if a² - d² were negative, then (c² - b²) would have to be negative as well to make the product positive. However, even in that case, since a, d, b, c are positive integers, but we need to check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but if a² - d² is negative, then d² - a² is positive. Similarly, c² - b² positive would mean b² < c², so b < c. If both factors are negative, then (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) are negative, so their product is positive. But we need to check if that's possible.\n\nBut maybe starting with positive factors is simpler. Let's consider that (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) are positive integers. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021.\n\nSo, 2021 is the product of two positive integers. Let's factorize 2021 to find possible pairs.\n\nFirst, check if 2021 is prime. Let's divide by small primes:\n\n2021 ÷ 43 = 47. 43*47 = 2021. Yes, 43*47=2021. So 2021 factors into 1*2021, 43*47.\n\nSo the possible positive integer pairs (x, y) such that x*y=2021 are (1,2021), (43,47), (47,43), (2021,1). But since (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) are positive integers, and a, c > d, b, so x and y must be positive.\n\nBut we also need to consider if negative factors are possible. For example, if (a² - d²) is negative and (c² - b²) is negative. Then the product is positive. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf (a² - d²) is negative, then a² < d², so d < a. Similarly, (c² - b²) is negative implies c < b. Then, the equation becomes (d² - a²)(b² - c²) = 2021. But since d² - a² is positive (because d < a, so d² < a²) and b² - c² is positive (since b < c), then the product is (a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021. Wait, that's the same as the original equation. So regardless of the sign, the absolute values of (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) must multiply to 2021. Therefore, the possible pairs are (1,2021), (43,47), (47,43), (2021,1), and also (-1,-2021), (-43,-47), (-47,-43), (-2021,-1). But since (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) must be integers, but in the case of negative factors, even though they are negative, the product is positive. However, we need to check if negative factors are possible given the original variables.\n\nBut since a, b, c, d are positive integers, let's see:\n\nIf (a² - d²) is negative, then d² > a², so d > a. Similarly, (c² - b²) is negative, so c > b. Then, the equation becomes (a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021, which is (negative)(negative) = positive. So that's possible. So in addition to the positive factor pairs, we also have negative factor pairs. However, we need to check if such cases are possible.\n\nBut let's first consider positive factors. Let's list all possible positive integer pairs (x,y) such that x*y=2021:\n\n1*2021, 43*47, 47*43, 2021*1.\n\nSo for each of these pairs, we can set (a² - d²) = x and (c² - b²) = y, or vice versa. Wait, but the equation is (a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021. So either (a² - d²) = x and (c² - b²)=y, or (a² - d²) = y and (c² - b²)=x. But in either case, we can have positive or negative factors. Wait, but if we consider negative factors, we need to check if such a solution exists. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's handle the positive factors:\n\nCase 1: (a² - d²) = 1 and (c² - b²) = 2021.\n\nCase 2: (a² - d²) = 43 and (c² - b²) = 47.\n\nCase 3: (a² - d²) = 47 and (c² - b²) = 43.\n\nCase 4: (a² - d²) = 2021 and (c² - b²) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, the reverse cases where (a² - d²) = 2021 and (c² - b²)=1, etc. Wait, but actually, the equation is symmetric in (a² - d²) and (c² - b²), so the order doesn't matter. So each pair (x,y) and (y,x) will give different possibilities. So for each factor pair (x,y), we can have two possibilities: x*y=2021 or y*x=2021. But since 2021 is the same, the factor pairs are (1,2021), (43,47), etc., and their reverses. However, since multiplication is commutative, the product is the same. Therefore, perhaps we can consider unordered pairs, but since the factors are ordered, we need to consider both possibilities for each pair.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Let me think. For the equation (a² - d²)(c² - b²) = 2021, the left-hand side is the product of two terms. So if (a² - d²) = x and (c² - b²) = y, then x*y=2021. But if we switch them, (a² - d²)=y and (c² - b²)=x, it's still the same product. Therefore, the unordered pairs are (1,2021), (43,47). So there are four possibilities: (1,2021), (2021,1), (43,47), (47,43). However, the reverse pairs will lead to different equations, but since the product is the same, they might not lead to distinct solutions. Wait, but perhaps in some cases, switching x and y could lead to different solutions. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we take (a² - d²)=1 and (c² - b²)=2021. Then, we can solve for a, d, c, b. Similarly, if we take (a² - d²)=2021 and (c² - b²)=1, then we can solve for a, d, c, b. These are two different cases. Similarly for the other factor pairs. So even though the factor pairs are unordered, the order matters for the equations. Therefore, we need to consider all possible ordered pairs.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 possible ordered pairs:\n\n(1,2021), (2021,1), (43,47), (47,43), (-1,-2021), (-2021,-1), (-43,-47), (-47,-43).\n\nBut since (a² - d²) and (c² - b²) must be integers, and since a, d, b, c are positive integers, we need to check if such equations can be satisfied.\n\nFirst, let's consider positive factors:\n\nSubcase 1: (a² - d²)=1 and (c² - b²)=2021.\n\nSubcase 2: (a² - d²)=2021 and (c² - b²)=1.\n\nSubcase 3: (a² - d²)=43 and (c² - b²)=47.\n\nSubcase 4: (a² - d²)=47 and (c² - b²)=43.\n\nSimilarly, the negative factors:\n\nSubcase 5: (a² - d²)=-1 and (c² - b²)=-2021.\n\nSubcase 6: (a² - d²)=-2021 and (c² - b²)=-1.\n\nSubcase 7: (a² - d²)=-43 and (c² - b²)=-47.\n\nSubcase 8: (a² - d²)=-47 and (c² - b²)=-43.\n\nWe need to check all these subcases to see if there are integer solutions for a, b, c, d in positive integers.\n\nStarting with Subcase 1: (a² - d²)=1 and (c² - b²)=2021.\n\nFirst equation: a² - d²=1. This factors as (a - d)(a + d)=1. Since a and d are positive integers, the only solution is a - d=1 and a + d=1. But solving these equations:\n\na - d =1\n\na + d =1\n\nAdding both equations: 2a =2 ⇒ a=1. Then, substituting back, d=0. But d must be a positive integer, so d=0 is invalid", "answer": "Levou stranu zadané rovnice roznásobme a dále upravujeme:  \n\n\\[\n(a^2 - b^2)(c^2 - d^2) + (b^2 - d^2)(c^2 - a^2) =\n\\]  \n\\[\n= (a^2c^2 - a^2d^2 - b^2c^2 + b^2d^2) + (b^2c^2 - a^2b^2 - c^2d^2 + a^2d^2) =\n\\]  \n\\[\n= a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 - a^2b^2 - c^2d^2 = a^2(c^2 - b^2) + d^2(b^2 - c^2) =\n\\]  \n\\[\n= (a^2 - d^2)(c^2 - b^2) = (a - d)(a + d)(c - b)(c + b).\n\\]\n\nRovnice ze zadání je tedy ekvivalentní s rovnicí  \n\n\\[\n(a - d)(a + d)(c - b)(c + b) = 2021 = 43 \\cdot 47.\n\\]\n\nČísla \\(a, b, c, d\\) jsou přirozená, takže oba činitele \\(a + d\\) a \\(c + b\\) z levé strany rovnice jsou celá čísla větší než 1.
