The condition is that no two points lie on the same horizontal or vertical line. Then, Lolek comes in and for each of these \\( 2n \\) points, he draws two half-lines starting at that point: one vertical and one horizontal. The goal is to figure out the maximum number \\( k \\) such that no matter how Bolek places the points, Lolek can always create at least \\( k \\) regions on the plane.\n\nHmm, let me try to visualize this. So, we have \\( 2n \\) points, each with a horizontal and vertical half-line. Since no two points are on the same horizontal or vertical line, each point's horizontal and vertical lines won't overlap with others in that direction. But they can intersect with lines from other points.\n\nI remember that when you have lines (or in this case, half-lines) drawn on a plane, the maximum number of regions they can divide the plane into is given by some formula. For lines, it's \\( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + 1 \\) where \\( m \\) is the number of lines. But here, we have half-lines, which are like rays starting from a point. So, each point contributes two rays: one horizontal and one vertical.\n\nWait, but each point has two rays, so total rays are \\( 4n \\). But these rays are not all independent because they are constrained by the points' positions. Also, since no two points share a horizontal or vertical line, each horizontal ray from one point won't interfere with another horizontal ray from another point, same with vertical rays.\n\nBut when you have both horizontal and vertical rays, they can intersect each other. Each horizontal ray can potentially intersect with each vertical ray from other points. So, the number of intersections would be significant.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out how many regions these rays can divide the plane into. For lines, the formula is \\( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + 1 \\), but for rays, it's different because rays only extend in one direction.\n\nWait, actually, for rays, the formula for the maximum number of regions is similar but adjusted. For \\( m \\) rays, the maximum number of regions is \\( m(m - 1) + 2 \\). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a grid. If I have horizontal and vertical rays, they can form a grid-like structure, but since each point only has one horizontal and one vertical ray, it's not a full grid. Instead, each point contributes one horizontal and one vertical line segment, but since they are rays, they extend infinitely in one direction.\n\nWait, but in the problem, Lolek draws two half-lines for each point: one horizontal and one vertical. So, each point has a horizontal ray going left and right, but since it's a half-line, it's only in one direction? Or does it mean both directions? The problem says \"dwa półproste o początku w tym punkcie\", which translates to \"two half-lines starting at this point\". So, each point has two half-lines: one horizontal and one vertical. But in which directions? Are they both in one direction, or can they be in any direction?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the direction, just that they are half-lines starting at the point. So, for each point, Lolek can choose the direction of the horizontal and vertical rays. So, he can decide whether the horizontal ray goes left or right, and the vertical ray goes up or down. But since the points are placed such that no two are on the same horizontal or vertical line, Lolek can choose the directions in a way that maximizes the number of intersections, thereby maximizing the number of regions.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the directions of the rays (horizontal and vertical) for each point such that the number of regions created is maximized, regardless of how Bolek places the points.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"co najmniej \\( k \\) obszarów niezależnie od położenia punktów narysowanych przez Bolka.\" So, regardless of how Bolek places the points, Lolek can always get at least \\( k \\) regions. So, we need the minimal number of regions that Lolek can guarantee, no matter how the points are arranged.\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum \\( k \\) such that for any placement of \\( 2n \\) points with no two on the same horizontal or vertical line, Lolek can draw the rays in such a way that the plane is divided into at least \\( k \\) regions.\n\nHmm, okay. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each point is a vertex, and the horizontal and vertical rays are edges. But since the rays are half-lines, they can be thought of as edges extending infinitely in one direction.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think about how each ray can intersect with others.\n\nEach horizontal ray can potentially intersect with each vertical ray from other points. Since no two points share a horizontal or vertical line, each horizontal ray from one point will intersect with each vertical ray from another point.\n\nSo, for each point, its horizontal ray can intersect with \\( 2n - 1 \\) vertical rays (since there are \\( 2n \\) points, but one is itself, so \\( 2n - 1 \\) others). Similarly, each vertical ray can intersect with \\( 2n - 1 \\) horizontal rays.\n\nBut wait, each intersection is between a horizontal and a vertical ray. So, the total number of intersections would be \\( (2n) \\times (2n - 1) \\) divided by something? Wait, no, because each horizontal ray can intersect with each vertical ray from a different point.\n\nWait, actually, each horizontal ray from point A can intersect with each vertical ray from any other point B. Since there are \\( 2n \\) points, each horizontal ray can intersect with \\( 2n - 1 \\) vertical rays. So, total intersections would be \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\). But each intersection is counted once for each pair of a horizontal and a vertical ray.\n\nBut actually, each intersection is uniquely determined by a horizontal ray and a vertical ray from different points. So, the total number of intersections is indeed \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. Because each horizontal ray can only intersect with vertical rays from other points, but each vertical ray is from a different point. So, for each point, its horizontal ray can intersect with vertical rays from the other \\( 2n - 1 \\) points. So, total intersections would be \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut each intersection is a crossing between a horizontal and a vertical ray, so each intersection is a unique point where a horizontal and vertical ray cross. So, the number of intersections is \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because each horizontal ray can only intersect with each vertical ray once, but if you have \\( 2n \\) horizontal rays and \\( 2n \\) vertical rays, the maximum number of intersections is \\( 2n \\times 2n = 4n^2 \\). But since each horizontal ray is from a different point and each vertical ray is from a different point, and no two horizontal rays are colinear, same with vertical, the maximum number of intersections is indeed \\( 4n^2 \\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too high because each horizontal ray can only intersect with vertical rays from other points, not its own. So, for each horizontal ray, it can intersect with \\( 2n - 1 \\) vertical rays, so total intersections would be \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut let me think again. Each horizontal ray is from a unique point, and each vertical ray is from a unique point. So, for each horizontal ray, it can potentially intersect with vertical rays from all other points, which are \\( 2n - 1 \\). So, total intersections would be \\( 2n \\times (2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut each intersection is a unique point where a horizontal and vertical ray cross. So, the number of intersections is \\( 2n(2n - 1) \\).\n\nBut now, how does this relate to the number of regions?\n\nIn planar arrangements, the number of regions created by lines (or rays) can be calculated using Euler's formula: \\( V - E + F = 2 \\), where \\( V \\) is the number of vertices (intersections), \\( E \\) is the number of edges, and \\( F \\) is the number of faces (regions).\n\nBut in this case, we have rays, not lines, so we have to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nEach ray is an infinite half-line, so it contributes one edge to the graph. Each intersection is a vertex.\n\nSo, let's try to compute \\( V \\), \\( E \\), and then \\( F \\).\n\nFirst, the number of vertices \\( V \\) is the number of intersections, which is \\( 2n(2n - 1) \\).\n\nNext, the number of edges \\( E \\). Each horizontal ray is divided into segments by the intersections. Each horizontal ray can be intersected by \\( 2n - 1 \\) vertical rays, so each horizontal ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments (including the infinite part). Similarly, each vertical ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments by the horizontal rays.\n\nBut wait, each horizontal ray is a single half-line, so it starts at a point and goes infinitely in one direction. Each intersection on a horizontal ray splits it into more segments. So, if a horizontal ray is intersected by \\( k \\) vertical rays, it is divided into \\( k + 1 \\) segments.\n\nBut in our case, each horizontal ray can be intersected by \\( 2n - 1 \\) vertical rays (from other points), so each horizontal ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments. Similarly, each vertical ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments by the horizontal rays.\n\nBut since each intersection is shared by one horizontal and one vertical ray, the total number of edges contributed by horizontal rays is \\( 2n \\times 2n = 4n^2 \\), and similarly for vertical rays, it's also \\( 4n^2 \\). But wait, that can't be right because each intersection is counted twice, once for the horizontal ray and once for the vertical ray.\n\nWait, no. Each edge is a segment between two vertices. Each horizontal ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments, so each contributes \\( 2n \\) edges. Similarly, each vertical ray is divided into \\( 2n \\) segments, contributing \\( 2n \\) edges. So, total edges would be \\( 2n \\times 2n + 2n \\times 2n = 8n^2 \\). But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no. Each intersection is a vertex where a horizontal and vertical ray meet. Each horizontal ray is split into \\( 2n \\) edges, so total horizontal edges are \\( 2n \\times 2n = 4n^2 \\). Similarly, vertical edges are also \\( 4n^2 \\). So, total edges \\( E = 4n^2 + 4n^2 = 8n^2 \\).\n\nBut Euler's formula is \\( V - E + F = 2 \\). So, \\( F = E - V + 2 \\).\n\nPlugging in, \\( F = 8n^2 - 2n(2n - 1) + 2 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( F = 8n^2 - 4n^2 + 2n + 2 = 4n^2 + 2n + 2 \\).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the number of regions should be much smaller. For example, when \\( n = 1 \\), we have 2 points, each with a horizontal and vertical ray. Depending on the directions, the number of regions can be 4. Let's test with \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), \\( 2n = 2 \\) points. Each point has a horizontal and vertical ray. If we arrange the rays such that the horizontal rays are in opposite directions and vertical rays are in opposite directions, we can get 4 regions. So, \\( k = 4 \\) when \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nBut according to the formula above, \\( F = 4(1)^2 + 2(1) + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 \\). That's not matching. So, my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of edges or vertices.\n\nWait, let's reconsider. For \\( n = 1 \\), we have 2 points. Each point has a horizontal and vertical ray. So, total horizontal rays: 2, total vertical rays: 2. Each horizontal ray can intersect with each vertical ray, so total intersections: 2 x 2 = 4. But wait, each horizontal ray is from a different point, so each horizontal ray can intersect with both vertical rays. So, total intersections: 2 x 2 = 4.\n\nBut in reality, for two points, each with a horizontal and vertical ray, the number of intersections is 2 x 2 = 4? Wait, no. Each horizontal ray from point A can intersect with each vertical ray from point B, so yes, 2 x 2 = 4 intersections.\n\nBut in reality, for two points, each with a horizontal and vertical ray, the number of intersections is 4. So, \\( V = 4 \\).\n\nEach horizontal ray is divided into 2 segments by the intersections, so each horizontal ray contributes 2 edges. So, total horizontal edges: 2 x 2 = 4. Similarly, vertical edges: 2 x 2 = 4. So, total edges \\( E = 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nApplying Euler's formula: \\( V - E + F = 2 \\). So, \\( 4 - 8 + F = 2 \\), which gives \\( F = 6 \\). But the actual number of regions is 4, not 6. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe because the graph is not connected? Or perhaps because the infinite regions are being counted differently.\n\nWait, in planar graphs, Euler's formula applies to connected planar graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the formula is \\( V - E + F = C + 1 \\), where \\( C \\) is the number of connected components. So, if the graph is disconnected, we have to adjust accordingly.\n\nIn the case of two points, each with two rays, the graph is actually two separate graphs, each consisting of a horizontal and vertical ray intersecting each other. So, each point's horizontal and vertical rays form a cross, which is a connected component.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. We have a sum where each term is either the positive or negative of its position. So, for each \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( n \\), \\( s_i \\) is either 1 or -1. The total sum of these terms needs to be zero. So, I need to figure out for which \\( n \\) this is possible.\n\nLet me start by considering small values of \\( n \\) and see if I can find a pattern or come up with a general rule.\n\nStarting with \\( n = 1 \\):\nThe sum would just be \\( 1 \\cdot s_1 \\). Since \\( s_1 \\) can be either 1 or -1, the sum can be 1 or -1. It can never be zero. So, \\( n = 1 \\) is not possible.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 2 \\):\nThe sum is \\( 1 \\cdot s_1 + 2 \\cdot s_2 \\). Let's list all possible combinations:\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 \\): Sum = 1 + 2 = 3\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = -1 \\): Sum = 1 - 2 = -1\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1 \\): Sum = -1 + 2 = 1\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = -1 \\): Sum = -1 - 2 = -3\n\nNone of these sums are zero. So, \\( n = 2 \\) is also not possible.\n\nNext, \\( n = 3 \\):\nSum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 \\). Let's see if we can get zero.\n\nLet me try different combinations:\n- If \\( s_3 = 1 \\), then the sum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3 \\). To get zero, \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 = -3 \\). The maximum negative sum here is -3 (if both \\( s_1 = -1 \\) and \\( s_2 = -1 \\)), so that would give \\( -1 -2 + 3 = 0 \\). Wait, that works! So, \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = -1, s_3 = 1 \\) gives 0. So, \\( n = 3 \\) is possible.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n- \\( 1*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 3*1 = -1 -2 +3 = 0 \\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, \\( n = 3 \\) is possible.\n\nNow, \\( n = 4 \\):\nSum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 \\). Let's see if we can get zero.\n\nFirst, let's compute the total sum if all \\( s_i = 1 \\): 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. If all \\( s_i = -1 \\), the sum is -10. So, the possible sums range from -10 to 10 in steps of 2 (since each term changes the sum by an even number when flipping a sign). Wait, actually, each term is either added or subtracted, so the total sum can be any even number between -10 and 10? Hmm, not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nWait, the total sum when all are 1 is 10. If I flip one term, say \\( s_4 \\), the sum becomes 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 2. If I flip another term, say \\( s_3 \\), it becomes 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 = -4. Hmm, so the possible sums are even numbers? Because each flip changes the sum by an even number. So, starting from 10, flipping one term changes the sum by \\( 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is the term flipped. So, the total sum will always be even. Therefore, to get zero, which is even, it's possible.\n\nBut wait, is zero achievable? Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nLet me attempt to find \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\) such that the sum is zero.\n\nLet me denote the sum as \\( S = s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 = 0 \\).\n\nI need to find \\( s_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\} \\) such that this holds.\n\nLet me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, let me try to have positive and negative terms balance each other.\n\nSuppose I set \\( s_4 = -1 \\), so the term is -4. Then, the remaining sum should be 4.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 = 4 \\).\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nPossible values for \\( s_1, s_2, s_3 \\) are 1 or -1.\n\nLet me try \\( s_3 = 1 \\), so 3 is added. Then, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = 1 \\).\n\nPossible combinations for \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = 1 \\):\n\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 0 \\): Not possible, since \\( s_2 \\) must be ±1.\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 \\): 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ 1\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = -1 \\): 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ 1\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1 \\): -1 + 2 = 1. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1, s_3 = 1, s_4 = -1 \\).\n\nLet me check the sum:\n\n\\( (-1) + 2*1 + 3*1 + 4*(-1) = -1 + 2 + 3 -4 = 0 \\). Perfect, that works.\n\nSo, \\( n = 4 \\) is possible.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 5 \\):\n\nSum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 + 5s_5 \\). Let's see if zero is achievable.\n\nFirst, the total sum when all are 1 is 15. So, the possible sums range from -15 to 15, stepping by 2, as each flip changes the sum by an even number. So, zero is even, so it's possible in terms of parity.\n\nBut let's try to find such a combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\), it's possible, and see if I can build up for higher \\( n \\).\n\nBut let me try to see if \\( n = 5 \\) is possible.\n\nLet me attempt to find \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5 \\) such that the sum is zero.\n\nLet me denote the sum as \\( S = s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 + 5s_5 = 0 \\).\n\nI need to find such \\( s_i \\).\n\nLet me try to set some terms to -1 and see if the rest can balance.\n\nSuppose I set \\( s_5 = -1 \\), so the term is -5. Then, the remaining sum should be 5.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 = 5 \\).\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nLet me try \\( s_4 = 1 \\), so 4 is added. Then, the remaining sum is 1.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 = 1 \\).\n\nLet me try \\( s_3 = 1 \\), so 3 is added. Then, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = -2 \\).\n\nPossible combinations for \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = -2 \\):\n\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = -1 \\): -1 -2 = -3 ≠ -2\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1 \\): -1 + 2 = 1 ≠ -2\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = -1 \\): 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ -2\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 \\): 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ -2\n\nHmm, none of these work. Maybe \\( s_3 = -1 \\), so 3 is subtracted, making the remaining sum \\( 1 - 3 = -2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = -2 \\). Wait, that's the same as before, which didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me try setting \\( s_5 = 1 \\), so the term is +5. Then, the remaining sum should be -5.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 = -5 \\).\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nLet me try \\( s_4 = -1 \\), so -4 is added. Then, the remaining sum is -1.\n\nSo, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 = -1 \\).\n\nLet me try \\( s_3 = -1 \\), so -3 is added. Then, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = 2 \\).\n\nPossible combinations for \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = 2 \\):\n\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 \\): 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ 2\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = -1 \\): 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ 2\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1 \\): -1 + 2 = 1 ≠ 2\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = -1 \\): -1 - 2 = -3 ≠ 2\n\nNo luck there. Maybe \\( s_3 = 1 \\), so 3 is added. Then, \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = -4 \\).\n\nPossible combinations for \\( s_1 + 2s_2 = -4 \\):\n\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = -1 \\): -1 -2 = -3 ≠ -4\n- \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1 \\): -1 + 2 = 1 ≠ -4\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = -1 \\): 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ -4\n- \\( s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 \\): 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ -4\n\nStill no good. Maybe I need to adjust \\( s_4 \\).\n\nLet me try \\( s_4 = 1 \\), so +4. Then, the remaining sum is -5 -4 = -9. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to set more terms to -1.\n\nLet me try \\( s_5 = 1 \\), \\( s_4 = -1 \\), \\( s_3 = -1 \\), \\( s_2 = 1 \\), \\( s_1 = -1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( s_1 = -1, s_2 = 1, s_3 = -1, s_4 = -1, s_5 = 1 \\).\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n\\( (-1) + 2*1 + 3*(-1) + 4*(-1) + 5*1 = -1 + 2 -3 -4 +5 = (-1 + 2) + (-3 -4) +5 = 1 -7 +5 = -1 \\). Not zero.\n\nHmm, maybe another combination.\n\nWhat if \\( s_5 = 1 \\), \\( s_4 = 1 \\), \\( s_3 = -1 \\), \\( s_2 = -1 \\), \\( s_1 = -1 \\).\n\nSum: \\( -1 + 2*(-1) + 3*(-1) + 4*1 +5*1 = -1 -2 -3 +4 +5 = (-1 -2 -3) + (4 +5) = -6 +9 = 3 \\). Not zero.\n\nAlternatively, \\( s_5 = 1 \\), \\( s_4 = -1 \\), \\( s_3 = 1 \\), \\( s_2 = -1 \\), \\( s_1 = -1 \\).\n\nSum: \\( -1 + 2*(-1) + 3*1 +4*(-1) +5*1 = -1 -2 +3 -4 +5 = (-1 -2 -4) + (3 +5) = -7 +8 = 1 \\). Close, but not zero.\n\nWait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the total sum.\n\nThe total sum when all \\( s_i = 1 \\) is 15. To get zero, we need to flip some terms from positive to negative, effectively subtracting twice their value. So, the total sum after flipping is \\( 15 - 2 \\times \\text{(sum of flipped terms)} = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( 2 \\times \\text{(sum of flipped terms)} = 15 \\). But 15 is odd, and the left side is even, which is a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible to get zero for \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nWait, that's a good point. So, for \\( n = 5 \\), the total sum is 15, which is odd. To get zero, which is even, we need to subtract an odd number (15) by twice the sum of some subset, which is even.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first two equations, they look similar. Both are quadratic in a, b, and c, and both equal 1.

Let's see:\n\n\\( (a^2 - c^2) + 4b(a - c) = 0 \\)\n\nNotice that \\( a^2 - c^2 \\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into (a - c)(a + c). So:\n\n\\( (a - c)(a + c) + 4b(a - c) = 0 \\)\n\nNow, factor out (a - c):\n\n\\( (a - c)(a + c + 4b) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, this gives us two possibilities:\n\n1. \\( a - c = 0 \\) which implies \\( a = c \\)\n2. \\( a + c + 4b = 0 \\)\n\nLet me consider each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: \\( a = c \\)**\n\nIf a = c, then I can substitute c with a in the equations.

So, both equations 1 and 2 become identical when a = c. That means we only have two equations now: equation 1 and equation 3.\n\nEquation 3 is:\n\n\\( c^2 + 4ca + a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nBut since c = a, substitute:\n\n\\( a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 6a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\( a^2 = -\\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nHmm, but a^2 is always non-negative for real numbers, so this equation has no real solutions.

Let's solve for a:\n\n\\( a = -c - 4b \\)\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the other equations. Let's start with equation 1:\n\n\\( a^2 + 4ab + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute a with (-c - 4b):\n\n\\( (-c - 4b)^2 + 4(-c - 4b)b + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (-c - 4b)^2:\n\n\\( (-c - 4b)^2 = c^2 + 8bc + 16b^2 \\)\n\nNext, expand 4(-c - 4b)b:\n\n\\( 4(-c - 4b)b = -4bc - 16b^2 \\)\n\nNow, plug these back into the equation:\n\n\\( (c^2 + 8bc + 16b^2) + (-4bc - 16b^2) + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- c^2 remains as is.\n- 8bc - 4bc = 4bc\n- 16b^2 - 16b^2 = 0\n- Then, + b^2\n\nSo, combining all:\n\n\\( c^2 + 4bc + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, equation 1 reduces to:\n\n\\( c^2 + 4bc + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nBut that's exactly equation 2. So, substituting a in terms of b and c into equation 1 gives us equation 2 again. So, equation 1 doesn't give us new information in this case.\n\nTherefore, we need to use equation 3 to find a relationship.

Let's try to eliminate c^2.\n\nMultiply equation (2) by 3:\n\n\\( 3c^2 + 12bc + 3b^2 = 3 \\)  --- (2a)\n\nNow, add equation (2a) to equation (4):\n\n\\( (3c^2 + 12bc + 3b^2) + (-3c^2 - 8bc + 16b^2) = 3 + (-2) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n- 3c^2 - 3c^2 = 0\n- 12bc - 8bc = 4bc\n- 3b^2 + 16b^2 = 19b^2\n- 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n\\( 4bc + 19b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\\( 19b^2 + 4bc - 1 = 0 \\)  --- (5)\n\nNow, equation (5) is a quadratic in terms of c.

So, b ≠ 0.\n\nNow, substitute c from equation (6) into equation (2):\n\n\\( c^2 + 4bc + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nPlugging in c:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{-19b^2 + 1}{4b} \\right)^2 + 4b \\left( \\frac{-19b^2 + 1}{4b} \\right) + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: \\( \\left( \\frac{-19b^2 + 1}{4b} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nLet me square the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: \\( (-19b^2 + 1)^2 = (19b^2 - 1)^2 = (19b^2)^2 - 2*19b^2*1 + 1^2 = 361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1 \\)\n\nDenominator: \\( (4b)^2 = 16b^2 \\)\n\nSo, first term is \\( \\frac{361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1}{16b^2} \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( 4b * \\frac{-19b^2 + 1}{4b} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 4b cancels with the denominator 4b, so we have:\n\n\\( (-19b^2 + 1) \\)\n\nThird term: \\( b^2 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\( \\frac{361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1}{16b^2} + (-19b^2 + 1) + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nFirst, let's write all terms with denominator 16b^2:\n\n- The first term is \\( \\frac{361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1}{16b^2} \\)\n- The second term is \\( (-19b^2 + 1) \\), which can be written as \\( \\frac{(-19b^2 + 1) * 16b^2}{16b^2} \\)\n- The third term is \\( b^2 \\), which can be written as \\( \\frac{16b^4}{16b^2} \\)\n\nSo, combining all terms over the common denominator 16b^2:\n\n\\( \\frac{361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1 + (-19b^2 + 1)*16b^2 + 16b^4}{16b^2} = 1 \\)\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator:\n\nFirst, expand (-19b^2 + 1)*16b^2:\n\n= (-19b^2)(16b^2) + 1*(16b^2)\n= -304b^4 + 16b^2\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n361b^4 - 38b^2 + 1 - 304b^4 + 16b^2 + 16b^4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- 361b^4 - 304b^4 + 16b^4 = (361 - 304 + 16)b^4 = 73b^4\n- -38b^2 + 16b^2 = (-22b^2)\n- +1\n\nSo, numerator is:\n\n73b^4 - 22b^2 + 1\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n\\( \\frac{73b^4 - 22b^2 + 1}{16b^2} = 1 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 16b^2:\n\n73b^4 - 22b^2 + 1 = 16b^2\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n73b^4 - 22b^2 + 1 - 16b^2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n73b^4 - 38b^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSo, we have a quartic equation in terms of b:\n\n73b^4 - 38b^2 + 1 = 0\n\nLet me set y = b^2, so the equation becomes:\n\n73y^2 - 38y + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in y.

Hmm, that sounds a bit like a Latin square but extended to rectangles instead of just squares. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. We have an infinite chessboard, which means it's a grid that goes on forever in all directions. We need to place numbers from 1 to mn in such a way that any m×n or n×m rectangle you look at will contain each number exactly once. So, for example, if m=2 and n=3, every 2×3 or 3×2 block should have numbers 1 through 6, each appearing once.\n\nI wonder if this is related to tiling the plane with these rectangles. Maybe the way we arrange the numbers has to do with periodicity or some kind of repeating pattern. If we can find a repeating tile that can cover the entire infinite chessboard without overlapping or leaving gaps, that might work.\n\nLet me think about smaller cases. Let's start with m=1 and n=1. Then the set A is just {1}, and the chessboard is infinite, but each 1×1 square must contain 1. That's trivial, so (1,1) is definitely a solution.\n\nWhat about m=1 and n=2? Then A = {1,2}. We need to arrange numbers 1 and 2 on the infinite chessboard such that every 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle contains both numbers. So, in other words, every pair of adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically) must contain 1 and 2. That sounds like a checkerboard pattern. For example, we can alternate 1 and 2 in each row and column. So, yes, (1,2) and (2,1) should work.\n\nWait, but m and n are positive integers, so (1,2) and (2,1) are different pairs, but both should be valid. So, maybe all pairs where at least one of m or n is 1 work? Let me check m=1, n=3. Then A = {1,2,3}. We need every 1×3 or 3×1 rectangle to contain 1,2,3. So, in each row, every three consecutive squares must have 1,2,3 in some order, and similarly for columns. That seems possible by repeating the sequence 1,2,3,1,2,3,... in each row and column. So, (1,3) and (3,1) should also work.\n\nSo, maybe any pair where at least one of m or n is 1 is a solution. But what about when both m and n are greater than 1? Let's try m=2, n=2. Then A = {1,2,3,4}. We need every 2×2 square to contain 1,2,3,4. This is similar to a Latin square but for 2x2 blocks. Is this possible?\n\nYes, actually, it's called a \"Graeco-Latin square\" or an orthogonal Latin square. For order 2, it's possible. For example:\n\n1 2\n2 1\n\nBut wait, that's a 2x2 Latin square, but each 2x2 block here is the entire square, so it's trivial. But in our case, the chessboard is infinite, so we need a tiling where every 2x2 block is a permutation of 1-4. Hmm, actually, it's more like a tiling with 2x2 Latin squares. I think it's possible by repeating a 2x2 block across the entire grid. So, (2,2) should be a solution.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If we have a 2x2 block with numbers 1-4, and we repeat this block across the chessboard, then every 2x2 block will indeed contain 1-4. So, yes, (2,2) works.\n\nWhat about m=2, n=3? Then A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. We need every 2x3 or 3x2 rectangle to contain 1-6. Is this possible? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me try to construct such a tiling.\n\nOne approach is to use a toroidal grid, but since the chessboard is infinite, maybe we can use a repeating pattern. Let's try to create a 2x3 block that contains all numbers 1-6, and then repeat it.\n\nBut wait, if we tile the chessboard with 2x3 blocks, each 2x3 block will have numbers 1-6, but then a 3x2 block would overlap two such blocks. Hmm, but the 3x2 block would consist of three rows of two numbers each, which might not necessarily contain all six numbers. Wait, no, because each 2x3 block is 2 rows by 3 columns, so a 3x2 block would consist of three 2x2 blocks, each of which is a Latin square. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a numbering system where each cell's number is determined by its coordinates. For example, in a 2x3 grid, we can assign numbers based on rows and columns. Let me think: if we have coordinates (i,j), then maybe the number is something like (i mod m) * n + (j mod n). But wait, for m=2 and n=3, that would give numbers from 0 to 5, but we need 1 to 6. So, maybe adjust it by adding 1.\n\nSo, number at (i,j) would be ((i mod 2) * 3 + (j mod 3)) + 1. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: 0*3 + 0 +1=1\n\ni=0,j=1:0*3 +1 +1=2\n\ni=0,j=2:0*3 +2 +1=3\n\ni=1,j=0:1*3 +0 +1=4\n\ni=1,j=1:1*3 +1 +1=5\n\ni=1,j=2:1*3 +2 +1=6\n\nThen, repeating this pattern. Now, let's check a 2x3 block:\n\nRow 0: 1,2,3\n\nRow 1:4,5,6\n\nSo, that's good. Now, what about a 3x2 block? Let's take rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1.\n\nBut wait, the chessboard is infinite, so rows go on forever. So, a 3x2 block would include rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1. But in our numbering, row 2 would be the same as row 0 because it's mod 2. So, row 2 would be 1,2,3. So, the 3x2 block would have:\n\nRow 0:1,2\n\nRow 1:4,5\n\nRow 2:1,2\n\nSo, the numbers are 1,2,4,5,1,2. Wait, that's not all numbers from 1 to 6. It repeats 1 and 2. So, that doesn't work. Hmm, so this approach fails for 3x2 blocks.\n\nMaybe I need a different way to assign numbers so that both 2x3 and 3x2 blocks contain all numbers. Perhaps using a different formula.\n\nWhat if I use a different combination of row and column indices? Maybe something like (i * n + j) mod mn +1. For m=2, n=3, that would be (i*3 + j) mod 6 +1.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\ni=0,j=0:0+0=0 mod6=0 +1=1\n\ni=0,j=1:0+1=1 +1=2\n\ni=0,j=2:0+2=2 +1=3\n\ni=1,j=0:3+0=3 +1=4\n\ni=1,j=1:3+1=4 +1=5\n\ni=1,j=2:3+2=5 +1=6\n\nSo, the first row is 1,2,3; the second row is 4,5,6. Now, let's check a 3x2 block. Since the chessboard is infinite, a 3x2 block would include rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1.\n\nBut row 2 would be the same as row 0 because i=2 mod2=0. So, row 2:1,2,3.\n\nSo, the 3x2 block would have:\n\nRow0:1,2\n\nRow1:4,5\n\nRow2:1,2\n\nAgain, duplicates. So, same problem. Hmm.\n\nMaybe this approach isn't working because the rows repeat every m=2, so when we take a block of height n=3, it includes a repeated row. Maybe we need a different tiling where the rows don't repeat so quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different numbering scheme where both row and column indices contribute in a way that avoids repetition in both directions.\n\nWait, maybe using a pairing function that ensures that both row and column indices are used to generate unique numbers in both directions. For example, using the Cantor pairing function or something similar.\n\nThe Cantor pairing function is a bijection between N x N and N, but here we need a bijection between Z x Z and {1,2,...,mn}. But I'm not sure if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the numbers in such a way that each row is a shifted version of the previous one, and each column is also a shifted version. For example, in a 2x3 grid, shift each row by one more than the previous.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nRow0:1,2,3\n\nRow1:4,5,6\n\nBut as before, a 3x2 block would repeat rows. Alternatively, shift each row by 2:\n\nRow0:1,2,3\n\nRow1:3,4,5\n\nRow2:5,6,1\n\nBut wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's not possible for m=2, n=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's only possible when m and n are both 1 or both equal? Wait, no, because m=2, n=2 works.\n\nWait, let's think about the necessary conditions. For the tiling to work, the number of cells in each rectangle must be equal to the size of the set A, which is mn. So, that's satisfied. But more importantly, the arrangement must ensure that in every such rectangle, each number appears exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to a tiling with Latin squares, but extended to rectangles. Maybe the necessary condition is that m and n are both 1 or that one of them is 1. But wait, m=2, n=2 works, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m and n must be coprime? Let's see, m=2, n=3 are coprime, but earlier attempt didn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is related to the existence of a toroidal grid where the numbers can wrap around. If m and n are coprime, then a toroidal grid can be constructed without overlaps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is related to the existence of a perfect map or a graeco-latin square. Graeco-latin squares exist for orders that are not 2, 6, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, graeco-latin squares (or Euler's officer problem) are pairs of Latin squares that are orthogonal. They exist for all orders except 2 and 6. But in our case, we don't necessarily need orthogonality, just that every m×n or n×m rectangle contains all numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the grid can be tiled with a base block of size m×n, and that the numbering within the base block can be extended periodically. So, if we can find a numbering for the base block such that every row and column contains all numbers, then tiling the plane with this block would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut in the case of m=2, n=3, the base block is 2x3, and we need each row and column to contain all numbers. Wait, but in a 2x3 block, each row has 3 numbers, but we need 6 unique numbers. So, each row must contain 3 unique numbers, and each column must contain 2 unique numbers. But in a 2x3 block, each column has 2 numbers, which is less than 6. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, no, in the problem, every m×n or n×m rectangle must contain all numbers from 1 to mn. So, in the case of m=2, n=3, each 2x3 or 3x2 rectangle must contain 1-6. So, in the base block, which is 2x3, we need to arrange 1-6 such that each row (length 3) and each column (length 2) contains unique numbers. But in a 2x3 grid, each row has 3 numbers, so they must all be unique, and each column has 2 numbers, which must also be unique.\n\nBut in a 2x3 grid, each column has only 2 numbers, so they can't contain all 6 numbers. Wait, that's a problem. Because in a 3x2 block, each column has 3 numbers, but in a 2x3 block, each column has only 2 numbers. So, how can a 2x3 block contain all 6 numbers? It can't, because each column only has 2 numbers, and there are 3 columns, so maximum 6 numbers, but each number must appear exactly once in the entire block.\n\nWait, no, in a 2x3 block, there are 6 cells, each containing a unique number from 1-6. So, each row has 3 unique numbers, and each column has 2 unique numbers, but together, all 6 numbers are present. So, in that case, it's possible. For example:\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\nThis is a 2x3 block where each row has 3 unique numbers, and each column has 2 unique numbers, and all 6 numbers are present. Now, if we tile the plane with this block, then every 2x3 or 3x2 rectangle will contain all numbers 1-6. But wait, when we tile it, a 3x2 block would consist of three 2x2 blocks, each of which is a Latin square, but does it contain all", "answer": "y mod n = y' mod n oraz (x - y) mod m = (x' - y') mod m.\n\nTo zaś jest równoważne temu, że n dzieli liczbę y − y′ oraz m dzieli liczbę x − y − (x′ − y′) = (x − x′) − (y − y′).\n\nWykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt m × n przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że jeśli |x − x′| < m, |y − y′| < n i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′), to x = x′ i y = y′.

Analogicznie jak wyżej stwierdzamy, że y−y′ dzieli się przez n oraz że (x−x′)−(y−y′) dzieli się przez m. Liczba m dzieli się przez n, więc n dzieli liczbę (x−x′)−(y−y′), a skoro n dzieli y − y′, to musi też dzielić x − x′. Ponieważ x − x′ jest podzielna przez n liczbą o module mniejszym od n, więc x − x′ = 0. Stąd wniosek, że liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) jest równa y′ − y. Jest ona podzielna przez m i ma moduł mniejszy od m, więc y′ − y = 0. Otrzymaliśmy zatem x = x′ i y = y′."}

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It's asking whether there are infinitely many positive integers that you can't express in the form of a square number plus a prime. So, if I can find an infinite set of numbers where none of them can be written as \\( n^2 + p \\), then the answer would be yes. Otherwise, if every sufficiently large number can be expressed that way, then the answer would be no.\n\nI remember something about the Goldbach conjecture, which says that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But this is a bit different because here we're dealing with squares and primes. Maybe there's a similar approach or theorem that could help.\n\nLet me think about how numbers can be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). For a given \\( n \\), \\( p \\) would have to be a prime such that \\( p = k - n^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is the number we're trying to express. So, for each \\( k \\), we can check if \\( k - n^2 \\) is prime for some \\( n \\).\n\nBut how do we know if there are infinitely many \\( k \\) for which this isn't possible? Maybe I can look for numbers \\( k \\) that are of a certain form where \\( k - n^2 \\) is always composite. If I can find such a form that has infinitely many numbers, then that would answer the question.\n\nOne idea is to consider numbers of the form \\( k = 4n^2 \\). Let's see: if \\( k = 4n^2 \\), then \\( p = 4n^2 - n^2 = 3n^2 \\). But \\( 3n^2 \\) is only prime if \\( n^2 = 1 \\), because otherwise, it's a multiple of 3 and greater than 3, hence composite. So for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( 3n^2 \\) is composite. Therefore, \\( k = 4n^2 \\) cannot be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\nWait, but does this mean that all numbers of the form \\( 4n^2 \\) can't be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\)? Let me check for specific values. For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( k = 4(1)^2 = 4 \\). Can 4 be written as \\( 1^2 + p \\)? That would require \\( p = 3 \\), which is prime. So yes, 4 can be expressed as \\( 1^2 + 3 \\). Hmm, so my earlier reasoning was wrong because \\( n \\) can be different. So, for \\( k = 4n^2 \\), maybe there's another \\( n \\) such that \\( k - n^2 \\) is prime.\n\nLet me try \\( k = 4n^2 \\) for \\( n = 2 \\). Then \\( k = 16 \\). Can 16 be written as \\( m^2 + p \\) for some \\( m \\)? Let's see: \\( m \\) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. If \\( m = 1 \\), \\( p = 15 \\) (not prime). \\( m = 2 \\), \\( p = 12 \\) (not prime). \\( m = 3 \\), \\( p = 7 \\) (prime). So yes, 16 can be written as \\( 3^2 + 7 \\). So even though \\( k = 16 \\) is of the form \\( 4n^2 \\), it can still be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\) with a different \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, so maybe I need a different approach. Maybe instead of looking at squares, I should consider numbers that are one less than a square. For example, \\( k = n^2 - 1 \\). Then \\( p = k - m^2 \\). If \\( k = n^2 - 1 \\), then \\( p = n^2 - 1 - m^2 \\). For \\( m = n - 1 \\), \\( p = (n - 1)^2 - 1 = n^2 - 2n \\). That's not necessarily prime. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAnother thought: maybe looking at numbers that are congruent to a certain value modulo something. For example, if I can find a modulus where \\( k - n^2 \\) is always composite, then \\( k \\) can't be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). Let's think about modulo 3. If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p = k - n^2 \\). If \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), so \\( p \\) would have to be 3. If \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), which is possible for primes like 2, 5, 11, etc. Similarly, if \\( n^2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), but squares mod 3 are only 0 or 1, so \\( p \\) would be \\( 1 \\) or \\( 2 \\mod 3 \\). So maybe modulo 3 isn't restrictive enough.\n\nWhat about modulo 4? Squares mod 4 are either 0 or 1. So if \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p = k - n^2 \\). If \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), which would mean \\( p = 2 \\) or \\( p \\) is composite. If \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), which is possible for primes like 3, 7, 11, etc. So again, not sure if this helps.\n\nMaybe I should consider numbers that are 1 less than a multiple of a square. For example, \\( k = m^2 - 1 \\). Then \\( p = k - n^2 = m^2 - 1 - n^2 \\). If \\( m = n + 1 \\), then \\( p = (n + 1)^2 - 1 - n^2 = 2n \\). So \\( p = 2n \\), which is prime only if \\( n = 1 \\), giving \\( p = 2 \\). So \\( k = 3 \\) can be written as \\( 1^2 + 2 \\). But for larger \\( n \\), \\( p \\) would be even and greater than 2, hence composite. So numbers of the form \\( m^2 - 1 \\) can sometimes be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\), but not always.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Instead of trying to find numbers that can't be expressed, maybe I can show that there are infinitely many numbers that are not of the form \\( n^2 + p \\). To do this, perhaps I can construct an infinite set where each element cannot be written as \\( n^2 + p \\).\n\nOne idea is to consider numbers of the form \\( k = 2n^2 \\). Let's see if these can be expressed as \\( m^2 + p \\). So, \\( p = 2n^2 - m^2 \\). For \\( p \\) to be prime, \\( 2n^2 - m^2 \\) must be prime. Let's try specific values. For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k = 8 \\). Can 8 be written as \\( m^2 + p \\)? Let's see: \\( m = 1 \\), \\( p = 7 \\) (prime). So yes, 8 = 1 + 7. For \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 18 \\). Can 18 be written as \\( m^2 + p \\)? \\( m = 4 \\), \\( p = 18 - 16 = 2 \\) (prime). So yes, 18 = 16 + 2. Hmm, so maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAnother approach: consider numbers that are one less than a prime. For example, if \\( k = p - 1 \\), then \\( p = k + 1 \\). So \\( k = n^2 + p \\) would imply \\( k = n^2 + (k + 1) \\), which simplifies to \\( 0 = n^2 + 1 \\), which is impossible. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, if \\( k = p - 1 \\), then \\( p = k + 1 \\). So, if \\( k = n^2 + p \\), substituting \\( p \\) gives \\( k = n^2 + (k + 1) \\), which simplifies to \\( 0 = n^2 + 1 \\). That's not possible, so numbers of the form \\( p - 1 \\) can't be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). But there are infinitely many primes, so there are infinitely many numbers \\( k = p - 1 \\). Therefore, these numbers can't be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test with an example. Let \\( p = 5 \\), so \\( k = 4 \\). Can 4 be written as \\( n^2 + p \\)? That would require \\( n^2 + p = 4 \\). If \\( n = 1 \\), \\( p = 3 \\) (prime). So yes, 4 = 1 + 3. Hmm, so my earlier reasoning was flawed because \\( k = p - 1 \\) can sometimes be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\) with a different \\( p \\).\n\nSo, that approach doesn't work. Maybe I need to think about another property. Perhaps looking at numbers that are 2 mod something. For example, if \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p = k - n^2 \\). If \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), which is possible. If \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), which is also possible. So modulo 3 doesn't restrict it.\n\nWhat about modulo 4? If \\( k \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p = k - n^2 \\). If \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), which is possible. If \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p \\equiv 2 \\mod 4 \\), which would mean \\( p = 2 \\), the only even prime. So, if \\( k \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p = 2 \\) is possible only if \\( k - n^2 = 2 \\), so \\( n^2 = k - 2 \\). So, for \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n^2 = 1 \\), which works. For \\( k = 7 \\), \\( n^2 = 5 \\), which isn't a square. So, \\( k = 7 \\) can't be expressed as \\( n^2 + 2 \\), but maybe as \\( n^2 + p \\) with a different prime.\n\nWait, \\( k = 7 \\). Let's see: \\( n = 1 \\), \\( p = 6 \\) (not prime). \\( n = 2 \\), \\( p = 3 \\) (prime). So, 7 = 4 + 3. So, it can be expressed. Hmm, so maybe numbers congruent to 3 mod 4 can still be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\).\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe I need a different strategy. Perhaps looking at the density of numbers that can be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). If the density is less than 1, then there are infinitely many numbers that can't be expressed that way.\n\nI recall that the number of primes less than \\( x \\) is approximately \\( x / \\log x \\). The number of squares less than \\( x \\) is approximately \\( \\sqrt{x} \\). So, the number of possible \\( n^2 + p \\) less than \\( x \\) would be roughly \\( \\sqrt{x} \\times (x / \\log x) \\), but this is a rough estimate and might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for each \\( n \\), \\( p = k - n^2 \\) must be prime. So, for each \\( n \\), there's a certain number of \\( k \\) such that \\( k = n^2 + p \\). But as \\( n \\) increases, the number of possible \\( k \\) increases as well.\n\nBut even if each \\( n \\) can cover some \\( k \\), it's possible that the union of all these \\( k \\) doesn't cover all positive integers, leaving infinitely many out.\n\nWait, I think I remember something called the \"Hardy-Littlewood conjecture\" which deals with the representation of numbers as sums of a square and a prime. Maybe that can help. According to the conjecture, the number of representations of \\( k \\) as \\( n^2 + p \\) is asymptotically proportional to \\( \\sqrt{k} / \\log k \\). But this is just a heuristic and doesn't prove anything.\n\nHowever, even if the conjecture is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that every sufficiently large number can be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\). It just says that the number of such representations grows with \\( k \\). So, it's possible that there are still infinitely many numbers that can't be expressed that way.\n\nAnother angle: maybe considering the parity. If \\( k \\) is even, then \\( n^2 + p \\) must be even. So, either both \\( n^2 \\) and \\( p \\) are even, or both are odd. But the only even prime is 2. So, if \\( k \\) is even, either \\( n \\) is even (so \\( n^2 \\) is even) and \\( p = 2 \\), or \\( n \\) is odd (so \\( n^2 \\) is odd) and \\( p \\) is odd.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( k \\) is odd, then either \\( n \\) is even (so", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że dla dowolnej nieparzystej liczby \\(a \\geq 3\\) liczby \\(\\left(\\frac{3a+1}{2}\\right)^2\\) nie można przedstawić w żądanej postaci.

Przypuśćmy nie wprost, że \\(\\left(\\frac{3a+1}{2}\\right)^2 = n^2 + p\\) dla pewnej liczby całkowitej \\(n\\) i pewnej liczby pierwszej \\(p\\).

Wyznaczyć największą możliwą liczbę cykli.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about circles, chords, and cycles. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that we have a circle with a finite number of chords drawn on it. A \"cycle\" is defined as a closed polyline made from at least three different chords. Two cycles are considered the same if they consist of the same set of chords. It's given that there's a specific cycle C made up of 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. The task is to find the largest possible number of such cycles.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out the maximum number of cycles possible under the condition that each cycle shares at least one chord with cycle C. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a cycle is. A cycle is a closed polyline made from chords, so it's essentially a polygon inscribed in the circle, where each side is a chord. Since it's a closed polyline with at least three chords, it's like a polygon with at least three sides, but the chords don't have to be sides of a regular polygon; they can be any chords as long as they form a closed loop.\n\nNow, the key condition here is that every other cycle shares at least one chord with cycle C. So, cycle C is kind of a universal cycle that intersects with every other possible cycle in the circle. That suggests that cycle C must be constructed in such a way that it's impossible to have another cycle without sharing at least one chord with it.\n\nI need to figure out how to maximize the number of such cycles. Let me think about the structure of cycle C. It has 2022 chords. So, if I imagine a circle with 2022 chords forming a cycle, what does that look like? It's a polygon with 2022 sides, but since it's on a circle, it's a regular 2022-gon? Or maybe not necessarily regular, but just a polygon with 2022 chords.\n\nWait, but the chords don't have to be sides of a regular polygon. They can be any chords as long as they form a closed loop. So, cycle C is a polygonal path that starts and ends at the same point, using 2022 chords.\n\nBut the important thing is that every other cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, if I have another cycle, it can't be entirely made up of chords that are not in C. That means that for any other cycle, there must be at least one chord from C in it.\n\nSo, how can we maximize the number of such cycles? It seems like we need to consider all possible cycles that include at least one chord from C. But how many such cycles can there be?\n\nWait, but the problem is not just about including one chord from C, but about the entire cycle. So, each cycle must have at least one chord from C, but the rest of the chords can be arbitrary.\n\nBut the question is, how many such cycles can exist? The maximum number would be when every possible cycle that includes at least one chord from C is counted. But is that the case?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the circle has a finite number of chords. So, the total number of chords is finite, say n. Then, the number of possible cycles is related to the number of ways to choose chords and form cycles.\n\nBut in the problem, it's not specified how many chords are on the circle in total, only that cycle C has 2022 chords. So, perhaps the circle has more than 2022 chords, but cycle C is a specific set of 2022 chords forming a cycle.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"zaznaczono pewną skończoną liczbę cięciw,\" which translates to \"a finite number of chords are marked.\" So, the circle has a finite number of chords, say m, and cycle C is one of them with 2022 chords. The condition is that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the maximum number of cycles possible under this condition.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the circle has m chords, and cycle C is a specific cycle of 2022 chords. Then, any other cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, the total number of cycles is the number of cycles that include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how do we maximize this number? It depends on m, the total number of chords. But the problem doesn't specify m. So, perhaps m is variable, and we need to choose m such that the number of cycles including at least one chord from C is maximized, given that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the circle has a finite number of chords, but it doesn't specify how many. So, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when the circle has as many chords as possible, but with the constraint that every cycle must share at least one chord with C.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because if you have more chords, you can have more cycles, but the condition is that every cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when all other chords are connected in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the concept of a \"hitting set.\" In combinatorics, a hitting set is a set that intersects every set in a collection. Here, cycle C is a hitting set for all other cycles; every other cycle must intersect C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of cycles in a circle with chords, such that all cycles except C share at least one chord with C. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the structure of the chords. If cycle C is a polygon with 2022 sides, then any other cycle must share at least one edge (chord) with this polygon. So, the question is, how many cycles can we have in a circle where every cycle shares at least one edge with a given polygon of 2022 edges.\n\nBut the circle can have more chords, but the condition is that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the maximum number of cycles, given that every cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, perhaps the maximum number is achieved when all other chords are arranged in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe if all other chords are incident to at least one chord in C. That is, every other chord shares a vertex with a chord in C. Then, any cycle would have to include at least one chord from C because it would have to pass through a vertex connected to C.\n\nBut is that the case?\n\nWait, if all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, meaning that every other chord shares a vertex with a chord in C, then any cycle would have to include at least one chord from C because it would have to traverse through a vertex connected to C.\n\nBut is that necessarily true? Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have a chord from C, say AB. Then, all other chords are connected to either A or B. So, any cycle that goes through A or B must include chord AB or another chord connected to A or B. But wait, a cycle can go through A and B without necessarily including chord AB. For example, a triangle A-C-B-A would include chords AC, CB, and BA. But BA is in C, so it would share BA.\n\nBut if all other chords are connected to A or B, then any cycle that goes through A or B must include a chord connected to A or B, but not necessarily chord AB. So, it might not necessarily include a chord from C.\n\nHmm, so maybe that approach doesn't guarantee that every cycle shares a chord with C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if all other chords are connected to every chord in C. But that would require an enormous number of chords, which might not be feasible.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. If cycle C is a polygon with 2022 sides, then any other cycle must share at least one edge with it. So, the maximum number of cycles is the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nBut how many such cycles are there?\n\nIn a circle with n chords, the number of cycles is equal to the number of ways to choose a set of chords that form a closed loop. But if we fix that every cycle must include at least one chord from C, then the number of such cycles is equal to the total number of cycles minus the number of cycles that don't include any chord from C.\n\nBut the problem is that we don't know the total number of chords. So, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when the circle has as many chords as possible, but with the constraint that every cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the circle has a finite number of chords, but it doesn't specify how many. So, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when the circle has exactly 2022 chords, all forming cycle C. But then, there would be only one cycle, which is C itself. But the problem says that there exists a cycle C with 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, if the circle only has 2022 chords, then there are no other cycles, so the number of cycles is 1. But that can't be the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if the circle has more than 2022 chords, but all other chords are arranged in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, so that any cycle must pass through at least one chord in C.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, that might not necessarily be the case because a cycle can go through a vertex connected to C without including the chord in C.\n\nWait, maybe if all other chords are incident to at least one vertex of cycle C. So, every other chord is connected to at least one endpoint of a chord in C. Then, any cycle that goes through that endpoint must include a chord from C.\n\nBut again, a cycle can go through multiple endpoints without necessarily including the chord in C.\n\nWait, perhaps if all other chords are connected to all endpoints of C. But that would require each chord to be connected to every endpoint of C, which is impossible unless all chords are connected to all points, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if all other chords are connected to at least one endpoint of C, but not necessarily all.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that if all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, then any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider a simpler case. Suppose cycle C has 3 chords, forming a triangle. Then, what is the maximum number of cycles such that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C.\n\nIn this case, the circle has a triangle C, and other chords. Each other cycle must share at least one chord with C.\n\nSo, how many cycles can we have? Each cycle is a polygonal path made from chords, and each must include at least one chord from C.\n\nSo, the total number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles that include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how many such cycles are there?\n\nIn a circle with n chords, the number of cycles is equal to the number of ways to choose a set of chords that form a closed loop. But if we fix that every cycle must include at least one chord from C, then the number of such cycles is equal to the total number of cycles minus the number of cycles that don't include any chord from C.\n\nBut again, without knowing the total number of chords, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's given that cycle C has 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when all other chords are connected in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe if all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, then any cycle must pass through at least one chord in C.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, a cycle can go through a vertex connected to C without including the chord in C.\n\nWait, unless all other chords are connected to every chord in C. But that's not possible unless all chords are connected to all points, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, but arranged in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, perhaps if all other chords are connected to all the endpoints of C. So, if cycle C has 2022 chords, it has 2022*2 endpoints, but since it's a cycle, it's actually 2022 distinct points connected in a cycle.\n\nWait, no, a cycle with 2022 chords would have 2022 vertices, each connected by a chord to the next, forming a polygon. So, it's a 2022-gon.\n\nSo, the endpoints of C are 2022 distinct points on the circle.\n\nIf all other chords are connected to at least one of these 2022 points, then any cycle that goes through one of these points must include a chord from C.\n\nBut a cycle can go through multiple points without necessarily including the chord in C.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a triangle C, and another chord connecting two points of C. Then, a cycle could go through one point of C via the new chord, but not include the chord in C.\n\nSo, in that case, the cycle would not share a chord with C, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that every cycle shares at least one chord with C, all other chords must be connected in such a way that any cycle must pass through at least one chord in C.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe if all other chords are connected to all the points of C. But that's impossible unless all chords are connected to all points, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if all other chords are connected to every other chord in C. But that would require each chord to be connected to all others, which is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe if all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, but arranged in such a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to formalize that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of cycles is achieved when all other chords are connected to at least one chord in C, but arranged in a way that any cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. If cycle C is a polygon with 2022 sides, then any other cycle must share at least one edge with it. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nBut how many such cycles are there?\n\nIn a complete graph with n vertices, the number of cycles is equal to the sum", "answer": "Dla każdego cyklu \\( A \\) będziemy oznaczać przez \\( f(A) \\) zbiór wspólnych cięciw cykli \\( A \\) i \\( C \\).

At the start of the game, the k-th square from the left has a stone, and all the other squares are empty. Each turn of the game follows these steps: first, we place a dot on each square that has a stone. Then, we place a stone on each square that is adjacent to exactly one square with a dot. After that, we remove all stones that have dots. The game ends when there are no stones left on the board. The task is to find all pairs of positive integers (n, k) for which the game never ends, regardless of who plays.\n\nAlright, let me try to break this down. So, the board is a single row of n squares. Initially, only the k-th square has a stone. Each turn, we mark the current stones with dots, then add new stones to squares adjacent to exactly one marked square. Then, we remove all the marked stones. The game ends when there are no stones left.\n\nI need to figure out for which (n, k) the game never ends. That means, no matter how many turns we take, there will always be stones on the board. So, the game is infinite.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the process step by step. Let's consider small values of n and k to see if we can find a pattern or some insight.\n\nLet's start with n=1. If n=1, the board has only one square. Initially, that square has a stone. On the first turn, we mark it with a dot, then we look at its neighbors. Since it's the only square, it has no neighbors. So, we don't add any new stones. Then, we remove the marked stone. The game ends immediately. So, for n=1, regardless of k (but since n=1, k must be 1), the game ends in one move. So, n=1 is a losing position.\n\nNext, n=2. Let's see. If k=1, the initial stone is on the first square. On the first turn, we mark it. Then, we look at its neighbors. The first square has a neighbor on the right, which is empty. So, we don't add any stones. Then, we remove the marked stone. Now, the second square is empty, so the game ends.\n\nIf k=2, the initial stone is on the second square. Similar to k=1, on the first turn, we mark it. It has a neighbor on the left, which is empty. So, no new stones are added. Then, we remove the marked stone. The game ends.\n\nSo, for n=2, regardless of k, the game ends in one move. So, n=2 is also a losing position.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. For n=2, if k=1, after the first turn, the first square is removed, and the second square remains empty. So, the game ends. Similarly, if k=2, the second square is removed, and the first square is empty. So, yes, n=2 is a losing position.\n\nMoving on to n=3. Let's consider k=1, 2, 3.\n\nCase 1: k=1. Initial stone on square 1.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 1.\n- Neighbors of square 1: square 2. Since square 2 is empty, we don't add any stones.\n- Remove square 1. Now, square 2 is empty, square 3 is empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 2: k=2. Initial stone on square 2.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 2.\n- Neighbors of square 2: square 1 and square 3. Both are empty, so no new stones are added.\n- Remove square 2. Now, squares 1 and 3 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 3: k=3. Similar to k=1.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 3.\n- Neighbor is square 2, which is empty.\n- Remove square 3. Now, squares 1 and 2 are empty. Game ends.\n\nSo, for n=3, regardless of k, the game ends in one move. Hmm, so n=3 is also a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider a larger n. Let's try n=4.\n\nCase 1: k=1.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 1.\n- Neighbor is square 2, which is empty. So, no new stones.\n- Remove square 1. Now, squares 2, 3, 4 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 2: k=2.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 2.\n- Neighbors are square 1 and square 3. Both are empty.\n- Remove square 2. Now, squares 1, 3, 4 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 3: k=3.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 3.\n- Neighbors are square 2 and square 4. Both are empty.\n- Remove square 3. Now, squares 1, 2, 4 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 4: k=4.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 4.\n- Neighbor is square 3, which is empty.\n- Remove square 4. Now, squares 1, 2, 3 are empty. Game ends.\n\nSo, for n=4, regardless of k, the game ends in one move. Hmm, so n=4 is also a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering the right approach. Maybe the game doesn't always end in one move. Let me think about n=5.\n\nCase 1: k=1.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 1.\n- Neighbor is square 2, which is empty.\n- Remove square 1. Now, squares 2, 3, 4, 5 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 2: k=2.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 2.\n- Neighbors are square 1 and 3, both empty.\n- Remove square 2. Now, squares 1, 3, 4, 5 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 3: k=3.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 3.\n- Neighbors are square 2 and 4, both empty.\n- Remove square 3. Now, squares 1, 2, 4, 5 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 4: k=4.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 4.\n- Neighbors are square 3 and 5, both empty.\n- Remove square 4. Now, squares 1, 2, 3, 5 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 5: k=5.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 5.\n- Neighbor is square 4, which is empty.\n- Remove square 5. Now, squares 1, 2, 3, 4 are empty. Game ends.\n\nSo, for n=5, regardless of k, the game ends in one move. Hmm, so n=5 is also a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try n=6.\n\nCase 1: k=1.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 1.\n- Neighbor is square 2, empty.\n- Remove square 1. Now, squares 2,3,4,5,6 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 2: k=2.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 2.\n- Neighbors are 1 and 3, empty.\n- Remove square 2. Now, squares 1,3,4,5,6 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 3: k=3.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 3.\n- Neighbors are 2 and 4, empty.\n- Remove square 3. Now, squares 1,2,4,5,6 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 4: k=4.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 4.\n- Neighbors are 3 and 5, empty.\n- Remove square 4. Now, squares 1,2,3,5,6 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 5: k=5.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 5.\n- Neighbors are 4 and 6, empty.\n- Remove square 5. Now, squares 1,2,3,4,6 are empty. Game ends.\n\nCase 6: k=6.\n\nTurn 1:\n- Mark square 6.\n- Neighbor is square 5, empty.\n- Remove square 6. Now, squares 1,2,3,4,5 are empty. Game ends.\n\nSo, for n=6, regardless of k, the game ends in one move. Hmm, so n=6 is also a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering the right approach. Maybe the game always ends in one move, regardless of n and k. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for pairs (n, k) where the game never ends. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"Na początku gry na k-tym poluod lewej znajduje się kamień, a pozostałe pola są puste. Pojedyncza tura przebiega następująco. Na każdym kamieniu na planszy stawiamy kropkę. Następnie kładziemy kamień (bez kropki) na każdym polu sąsiadującym z do-kładnie jednym polem, na którym znajduje się kamień z kropką. Na koniecgry zdejmujemy z planszy wszystkie kamienie z kropką.

Let me try to parse it again.\n\nEach turn:\n\n1. On each stone on the board, we place a dot.\n\n2. Then, we place a stone on each square adjacent to exactly one square with a dot.\n\n3. Then, we remove all stones that have dots.\n\nWait, so step 2 is adding stones to squares adjacent to exactly one marked square. So, it's not just adding stones to squares that have exactly one neighbor with a stone, but adding stones to squares that are adjacent to exactly one square with a dot.\n\nWait, but the dots are only on the squares that had stones before the turn. So, in each turn, we mark the current stones, then add new stones to squares adjacent to exactly one marked square, then remove the marked stones.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Mark all current stones.\n\n- For each square, if it is adjacent to exactly one marked square, place a stone there.\n\n- Remove all marked stones.\n\nSo, the new stones are placed in squares that have exactly one neighbor with a stone from the previous turn.\n\nThis is similar to a cellular automaton, perhaps similar to the Game of Life, but with different rules.\n\nWait, let me think about n=2, k=1 again.\n\nTurn 1:\n\n- Mark square 1.\n\n- Now, look at each square:\n\n  - Square 1: has a dot.\n\n  - Square 2: adjacent to square 1, which has a dot. So, square 2 is adjacent to exactly one marked square. So, we place a stone on square 2.\n\n- Then, remove all marked stones (square 1).\n\n- Now, the board has square 2 with a stone.\n\nTurn 2:\n\n- Mark square 2.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 1: adjacent to square 2, which has a dot. So, square 1 is adjacent to exactly one marked square. So, place a stone on square 1.\n\n  - Square 2: has a dot, so we remove it.\n\n- Now, the board has square 1 with a stone.\n\nTurn 3:\n\n- Mark square 1.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 2: adjacent to square 1, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 2.\n\n  - Square 1: remove the dot.\n\n- Now, the board has square 2 with a stone.\n\nAnd this alternates indefinitely. So, for n=2, k=1, the game doesn't end. It alternates between square 1 and square 2 having stones.\n\nWait, so in my initial analysis, I thought that for n=2, the game ends, but actually, it doesn't. Because in each turn, you add a stone to the adjacent square, which then gets removed in the next turn. So, it's an infinite loop.\n\nSo, for n=2, k=1, the game doesn't end. Similarly, for n=2, k=2, let's see.\n\nTurn 1:\n\n- Mark square 2.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 1: adjacent to square 2, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 1.\n\n  - Square 2: remove the dot.\n\n- Now, the board has square 1 with a stone.\n\nTurn 2:\n\n- Mark square 1.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 2: adjacent to square 1, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 2.\n\n  - Square 1: remove the dot.\n\n- Now, the board has square 2 with a stone.\n\nTurn 3:\n\n- Mark square 2.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 1: adjacent to square 2, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 1.\n\n  - Square 2: remove the dot.\n\n- Now, the board has square 1 with a stone.\n\nAnd this alternates indefinitely. So, for n=2, regardless of k=1 or k=2, the game doesn't end. It alternates between the two squares.\n\nWait, so my initial analysis was wrong because I didn't consider that adding a stone to the adjacent square would create a new marked square in the next turn, which would then be removed. So, in n=2, the game doesn't end.\n\nSo, that changes things. So, for n=2, the game doesn't end for any k. So, (2,1) and (2,2) are both infinite games.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3, k=2.\n\nTurn 1:\n\n- Mark square 2.\n\n- Look at each square:\n\n  - Square 1: adjacent to square 2, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 1.\n\n  - Square 2: remove the dot.\n\n  - Square 3: adjacent to square 2, which has a dot. So, place a stone on square 3.\n\n- Now, the board has squares 1 and 3 with", "answer": "Takie pary \\((n, k)\\), że \\(n + 1\\) nie jest potęgą dwójki o wykładniku całkowitym dodatnim oraz \\(k\\) jest dowolną liczbą ze zbioru \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\).\n\nZauważmy, że po każdej turze wszystkie kamienie znajdują się na polach tej samej parzystości i parzystość ta zmienia się po każdej turze. Rzeczywiście, na początku gry ta własność zachodzi, bo jest tylko jeden kamień, a w każdej turze kamienie są dostawiane wyłącznie na pola sąsiadujące z tymi, na których stały kamienie przed wykonaniem tury.\n\nGrę w \\((1, 1)\\)-kamienie przegrywamy po wykonaniu pierwszej tury.

Rzeczywiście, skoro pierwsze i ostatnie pole są różnej parzystości, to na początku tury zawsze co najmniej jedno ze skrajnych pól planszy musi być puste. Dzięki temu w każdej turze zawsze możemy dostawić co najmniej jeden kamień bez kropki, gdyż jeśli np. ostatnie pole jest puste, to możemy dostawić kamień po prawej stronie kamienia z kropką znajdującego się najbardziej na prawo. Podobnie, jeśli pierwsze pole jest puste, to zawsze możemy dostawić kamień bez kropki po lewej stronie kamienia z kropką znajdującego się najbardziej na lewo.\n\nGrę w \\((n, k)\\)-kamienie możemy przeformułować w następujący sposób.

Wyznaczyć wszystkie dodatnie liczby całkowite \\( n \\), dla których Jadzia może to zrobić.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where Jadzia has a tetrahedron-shaped box with edges of length n, and she has n² triangular stickers, each with a side length of 2. She wants to cover the entire surface of the tetrahedron with these stickers, possibly by folding them, such that every point on the surface is covered by at least one sticker. I need to figure out for which positive integer values of n this is possible.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The edge length is n, so each face has an area that I can calculate. The area of an equilateral triangle is (√3/4) * side², so each face has an area of (√3/4) * n². Since there are four faces, the total surface area of the tetrahedron is 4 * (√3/4) * n², which simplifies to √3 * n².\n\nNow, each sticker is a smaller equilateral triangle with a side length of 2. The area of each sticker is (√3/4) * 2² = (√3/4) * 4 = √3. So, each sticker covers an area of √3.\n\nJadzia has n² stickers. So, the total area covered by all the stickers is n² * √3. For her to cover the entire tetrahedron, the total area of the stickers must be at least equal to the surface area of the tetrahedron. So, let's set up the inequality:\n\nn² * √3 ≥ √3 * n²\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I plug in the numbers, both sides are equal, which suggests that the total area of the stickers is exactly equal to the surface area of the tetrahedron. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the surface area of the tetrahedron is √3 * n², and the total area of the stickers is n² * √3, so they are equal. That suggests that, in terms of area, it's possible to cover the tetrahedron exactly with the stickers. But that's just the area condition. The problem is more about whether the stickers can be arranged in such a way that every point on the tetrahedron is covered by at least one sticker, possibly with overlaps.\n\nBut maybe the area condition is necessary but not sufficient. So, even if the total area matches, the arrangement might not be possible. So, I need to think about how the stickers can be placed on the tetrahedron.\n\nEach sticker is a triangle of side length 2, so each sticker can cover a certain area on the tetrahedron. Since the tetrahedron has edges of length n, the number of stickers needed per face would depend on how many 2-unit triangles can fit into an n-unit triangle.\n\nWait, but the tetrahedron's face is a triangle of side length n, and each sticker is a triangle of side length 2. So, how many stickers can fit on one face? Let me think about tiling a larger triangle with smaller triangles.\n\nIf the side length of the larger triangle is n, and each small triangle has a side length of 2, then the number of small triangles along one edge of the large triangle would be n/2, assuming n is even. If n is odd, it might not divide evenly, but since n has to be a positive integer, maybe n needs to be even for this to work without leftover space.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Jadzia has n² stickers, so maybe n has to be such that each face can be perfectly tiled with the stickers. Let me check that.\n\nEach face of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle of side length n. The number of small triangles (stickers) needed to cover one face would be (n/2)², because each edge is divided into n/2 segments of length 2, and the number of small triangles in a larger triangle is (k²) where k is the number of divisions per edge. So, if n is even, then n/2 is an integer, and the number of stickers per face is (n/2)². Since there are four faces, the total number of stickers needed would be 4 * (n/2)² = 4 * (n² / 4) = n². So, that matches the number of stickers Jadzia has.\n\nTherefore, if n is even, then each face can be perfectly tiled with (n/2)² stickers, and the total number of stickers is n², which is exactly what Jadzia has. So, in this case, it's possible to cover the tetrahedron without any overlaps, right?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that she can fold the stickers as needed. So, maybe even if n is odd, she can arrange the stickers in a way that covers the entire surface, perhaps with some overlaps. But from the area perspective, the total area of the stickers is exactly equal to the surface area of the tetrahedron, so if n is odd, the number of stickers per face would not be an integer, which might cause issues.\n\nWait, let me think again. If n is even, then each face can be perfectly tiled with (n/2)² stickers, so that's fine. If n is odd, then n/2 is not an integer, so you can't perfectly tile each face with whole stickers. Therefore, you would have some leftover space, which would require additional stickers, but Jadzia only has n² stickers, which is exactly the number needed if n is even. So, if n is odd, she wouldn't have enough stickers to cover each face without overlaps or gaps, which would make it impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem says she can fold the stickers as needed. So, maybe she can arrange the stickers across multiple faces, not just tiling each face individually. So, perhaps even if n is odd, she can arrange the stickers in such a way that they cover the entire surface, possibly overlapping edges or vertices.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about how the stickers can be arranged. Each sticker is a triangle of side length 2, so each sticker can cover parts of multiple faces if they are adjacent. But the tetrahedron is a three-dimensional object, so maybe the stickers can be arranged across different faces by folding.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each point on the surface must be covered by at least one sticker. So, perhaps the stickers can be arranged in such a way that they cover multiple faces, but I'm not sure if that's possible without leaving gaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only about tiling each face individually, in which case n must be even. But the problem allows for folding, so maybe it's possible to arrange the stickers across multiple faces, which might allow n to be odd.\n\nWait, but let me think about the area again. The total area of the tetrahedron is √3 * n², and the total area of the stickers is n² * √3, so they match exactly. So, if n is even, each face can be perfectly tiled with (n/2)² stickers, so that's fine. If n is odd, then each face would require (n/2)² stickers, but since n is odd, n/2 is not an integer, so you can't have a whole number of stickers per face. Therefore, you would need to have some stickers overlapping edges or vertices, but that might not be possible because each sticker is a flat triangle, and you can't have a fraction of a sticker.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for folding, so maybe the stickers can be arranged in a way that they cover multiple faces, effectively allowing the total number of stickers to be sufficient even if n is odd. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only about tiling each face individually, so n must be even. Let me check that.\n\nIf n is even, then each face can be tiled with (n/2)² stickers, so the total number of stickers is 4 * (n/2)² = n², which matches what Jadzia has. So, in that case, it's possible.\n\nIf n is odd, then each face would require (n/2)² stickers, but since n is odd, n/2 is not an integer, so you can't have a whole number of stickers per face. Therefore, you would need to have some stickers overlapping edges or vertices, but that might not be possible because each sticker is a flat triangle, and you can't have a fraction of a sticker.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for folding, so maybe the stickers can be arranged across multiple faces, effectively allowing the total number of stickers to be sufficient even if n is odd. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only about tiling each face individually, so n must be even. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can fold the stickers as needed, so maybe she can arrange the stickers in such a way that they cover multiple faces, allowing her to use the stickers more efficiently. So, perhaps even if n is odd, she can arrange the stickers to cover the entire surface.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose n is 3, which is odd. Each face is a triangle of side length 3. Each sticker is a triangle of side length 2. So, how many stickers would fit on one face? Well, along each edge, you can fit 1 sticker of length 2, with 1 unit remaining. So, maybe you can arrange the stickers in a way that covers the face with some overlapping.\n\nBut if you have 1 sticker along each edge, you can place 1 sticker in the center, but that might not cover the entire face. Alternatively, maybe you can arrange the stickers to cover the face with some overlapping, but I'm not sure if that would work.\n\nWait, but the total area of the stickers is exactly equal to the surface area of the tetrahedron, so if n is 3, the surface area is √3 * 9, and the total area of the stickers is 9 * √3, so it's exactly equal. So, in that case, maybe it's possible to arrange the stickers without any gaps or overlaps, but I'm not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's only possible when n is even because when n is even, each face can be perfectly tiled with (n/2)² stickers, so that's straightforward. When n is odd, you can't perfectly tile each face, so you would need to have some overlapping, which might not be possible because each sticker is a flat triangle, and you can't have a fraction of a sticker.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for folding, so maybe the stickers can be arranged in a way that they cover multiple faces, effectively allowing the total number of stickers to be sufficient even if n is odd.

Let me think about that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can fold the stickers as needed, so maybe she can arrange the stickers across multiple faces, which might allow her to cover the entire surface even if n is odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Since each sticker is a triangle of side length 2, and the tetrahedron has edges of length n, perhaps the number of stickers needed per face is (n/2)², as I thought before. So, if n is even, that's an integer, and the total number of stickers is n², which matches what she has. If n is odd, then (n/2)² is not an integer, so she can't perfectly tile each face, which would mean she can't cover the entire surface without overlaps or gaps. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for folding, so maybe she can arrange the stickers across multiple faces, which might allow her to cover the entire surface even if n is odd. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only about tiling each face individually, so n must be even.

But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of tiling the entire surface, not just individual faces. So, perhaps the tetrahedron can be covered by arranging the stickers across its faces, possibly overlapping edges or vertices, but ensuring that every point is covered by at least one sticker.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would work, because each sticker is a flat triangle, and the tetrahedron is a three-dimensional object.

Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use equation (1), (2), (3) to find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( f(t) \\) as \\( at^2 + bt + c \\) and use the three equations to solve for \\( a, b, c \\).\n\nLet me write the three equations again:\n\n1. \\( a x^2 + b x + c = y z \\)  \n2. \\( a y^2 + b y + c = z x \\)  \n3. \\( a z^2 + b z + c = x y \\)\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n\\[\na(y^2 - x^2) + b(y - x) = z x - y z.\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\na(y - x)(y + x) + b(y - x) = z(x - y).\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\( (y - x) \\):\n\n\\[\n(y - x)(a(y + x) + b) = z(x - y).\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n-(x - y)(a(y + x) + b) = z(x - y).\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( (x - y) \\) (since \\( x \\neq y \\)):\n\n\\[\n- (a(y + x) + b) = z.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n- a(x + y) - b = z. \\quad (6)\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n\\[\na(z^2 - y^2) + b(z - y) = x y - z x.\n\\]\n\nFactor:\n\n\\[\na(z - y)(z + y) + b(z - y) = x(y - z).\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\( (z - y) \\):\n\n\\[\n(z - y)(a(z + y) + b) = x(y - z).\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n- (y - z)(a(z + y) + b) = x(y - z).\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\( (y - z) \\):\n\n\\[\n- (a(z + y) + b) = x.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n- a(y + z) - b = x. \\quad (7)\n\\]\n\nNow, equations (6) and (7):\n\nFrom (6): \\( -a(x + y) - b = z \\).\n\nFrom (7): \\( -a(y + z) - b = x \\).\n\nLet me subtract equation (7) from equation (6):\n\n\\[\n[-a(x + y) - b] - [-a(y + z) - b] = z - x.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n- a(x + y) - b + a(y + z) + b = z - x.\n\\]\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\[\n- a x - a y + a y + a z = z - x.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n- a x + a z = z - x.\n\\]\n\nFactor:\n\n\\[\na(z - x) = z - x.\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( z \\neq x \\), we can divide both sides by \\( (z - x) \\):\n\n\\[\na = 1.\n\\]\n\nOh, so \\( a = 1 \\). That's a breakthrough.\n\nNow, knowing that \\( a = 1 \\), let's substitute back into equation (6):\n\n\\[\n- (1)(x + y) - b = z.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n- x - y - b = z.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nb = -x - y - z.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( b = - (x + y + z) \\).\n\nNow, let's find \\( c \\). Let's use equation (1):\n\n\\[\na x^2 + b x + c = y z.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = - (x + y + z) \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - (x + y + z)x + c = y z.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x^2 - x y - x z + c = y z.\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n- x y - x z + c = y z.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nc = x y + x z + y z.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the quadratic function is:\n\n\\[\nf(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z) t + (x y + x z + y z).\n\\]\n\nHmm, that looks familiar. It's similar to the expansion of \\( (t - x)(t - y)(t - z) \\), but wait, no, that would be a cubic. Wait, actually, \\( t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + xz + yz) \\) is the quadratic part of the expansion of \\( (t - x)(t - y)(t - z) \\), which is \\( t^3 - (x + y + z)t^2 + (xy + xz + yz)t - xyz \\). So, our quadratic is the first two terms of that expansion.\n\nBut anyway, now that we have \\( f(t) \\), we can compute \\( f(x + y + z) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: \\( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( - (x + y + z)^2 = -x^2 - y^2 - z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz \\).\n\nThird term: \\( + (xy + xz + yz) \\).\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz) + (-x^2 - y^2 - z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz) + (xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nLet's compute term by term:\n\n- \\( x^2 - x^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( y^2 - y^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( z^2 - z^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2xy - 2xy = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2xz - 2xz = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2yz - 2yz = 0 \\)\n- Then, we have \\( + (xy + xz + yz) \\).\n\nSo, everything cancels out except \\( xy + xz + yz \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nf(x + y + z) = xy + xz + yz.\n\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, despite the complicated setup, the value simplifies to the sum of the products of the variables two at a time.\n\nLet me just verify this result to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nGiven \\( f(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + xz + yz) \\), then:\n\n\\[\nf(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)^2 + (xy + xz + yz) = 0 + (xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the result is indeed \\( xy + xz + yz \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is \\( xy + xz + yz \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is \\boxed{xy + xz + yz}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a quadratic function \\( f \\) and distinct real numbers \\( x, y, z \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = yz, \\quad f(y) = zx, \\quad f(z) = xy,\n\\]\n\nwe need to find an explicit expression for \\( f(x + y + z) \\) in terms of \\( x, y, z \\).\n\nA quadratic function has the form \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\). Using the given conditions, we set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( a x^2 + b x + c = yz \\)\n2. \\( a y^2 + b y + c = zx \\)\n3. \\( a z^2 + b", "answer": "Funkcja \\( f \\) jest dana wzorem \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) dla pewnych liczb rzeczywistych \\( a, b, c \\).

Liczby \\( x, y \\) są różne, więc obie strony tego równania można podzielić przez \\( x - y \\).

The equations are:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n2. ac + bd = 3\n3. ad + bc = 2\n4. a + b + c + d = 6\n\nHmm, four equations with four variables. That should be solvable, but it might be a bit tricky. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to find some symmetry or substitution. The first three equations involve products of two variables each, and the last one is the sum. Maybe I can consider grouping variables or using substitution.\n\nLet me think about symmetric functions. If I let S = a + b + c + d = 6, which is given. Maybe I can also consider the sum of products, like ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd. Wait, but the first three equations are specific products: ab + cd, ac + bd, ad + bc. Maybe I can denote these as:\n\nLet me define:\n\nE1 = ab + cd = 6\n\nE2 = ac + bd = 3\n\nE3 = ad + bc = 2\n\nSo, E1, E2, E3 are given. Maybe I can find the sum E1 + E2 + E3.\n\nE1 + E2 + E3 = (ab + cd) + (ac + bd) + (ad + bc) = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd\n\nWhich is the sum of all possible products of two variables. So, that's equal to (a + c)(b + d) + (a + b)(c + d) or something? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I know that (a + b + c + d)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd). So, if I can find the sum of squares, maybe I can relate it.\n\nBut I don't have the sum of squares. Alternatively, maybe I can find the sum of E1, E2, E3.\n\nE1 + E2 + E3 = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = 11\n\nBut also, (a + b + c + d)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)\n\nWe know that a + b + c + d = 6, so 6^2 = 36 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2*11\n\nSo, 36 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 22\n\nTherefore, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 36 - 22 = 14\n\nSo, now I have the sum of squares: 14.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables in pairs. Let me set x = a + c and y = b + d. Then, since a + b + c + d = 6, we have x + y = 6.\n\nSimilarly, maybe I can express E1, E2, E3 in terms of x and y.\n\nWait, E1 = ab + cd. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe set u = a + b and v = c + d. Then u + v = 6.\n\nBut then, E1 = ab + cd. Hmm, ab is part of u, and cd is part of v. Maybe I can express ab in terms of u and a, or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the products. Let me think about the products ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of a, b, c, d as roots of a quartic equation. If I can find a quartic equation whose roots are a, b, c, d, then maybe I can use Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula for quartic equation x^4 - S1 x^3 + S2 x^2 - S3 x + S4 = 0, where S1 = a + b + c + d, S2 = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd, S3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd, S4 = abcd.\n\nWe know S1 = 6, S2 = 11. We don't know S3 and S4.\n\nBut maybe we can find S3 and S4 from the given equations.\n\nWait, let's see. The given equations are E1 = ab + cd = 6, E2 = ac + bd = 3, E3 = ad + bc = 2.\n\nIf I can find expressions involving S3 and S4, maybe I can relate them.\n\nLet me think about S3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd.\n\nHmm, S3 can be written as ab(c + d) + cd(a + b). Let me see:\n\nS3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd = ab(c + d) + cd(a + b)\n\nSimilarly, from E1, E2, E3, we have ab + cd = 6, ac + bd = 3, ad + bc = 2.\n\nWait, maybe I can express S3 in terms of E1, E2, E3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nS3 = ab(c + d) + cd(a + b)\n\nBut c + d = (a + b + c + d) - (a + b) = 6 - (a + b). Similarly, a + b = 6 - (c + d).\n\nWait, maybe I can denote p = a + b and q = c + d. Then p + q = 6.\n\nThen, S3 = ab q + cd p\n\nBut from E1, ab + cd = 6, so ab = 6 - cd, and cd = 6 - ab.\n\nWait, maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's express S3 as ab(c + d) + cd(a + b) = ab q + cd p.\n\nBut since p + q = 6, and ab + cd = 6, maybe we can find a relation.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider the products:\n\nFrom E1: ab + cd = 6\n\nFrom E2: ac + bd = 3\n\nFrom E3: ad + bc = 2\n\nIf I multiply all three equations together, maybe I can get something.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the products of pairs.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider the variables a, b, c, d as two pairs: (a, b) and (c, d). Then, maybe I can set x = a + b, y = c + d, and m = ab, n = cd.\n\nThen, from E1: m + n = 6\n\nAlso, from the sum: x + y = 6\n\nAdditionally, from the sum of squares: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 14\n\nBut a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = x^2 - 2m\n\nSimilarly, c^2 + d^2 = y^2 - 2n\n\nSo, total sum of squares: x^2 - 2m + y^2 - 2n = 14\n\nBut x + y = 6, so y = 6 - x\n\nAlso, m + n = 6\n\nSo, substituting y = 6 - x and n = 6 - m into the sum of squares:\n\nx^2 - 2m + (6 - x)^2 - 2(6 - m) = 14\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nx^2 - 2m + (36 - 12x + x^2) - 12 + 2m = 14\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 - 2m + 36 - 12x + x^2 - 12 + 2m = 14\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + x^2 = 2x^2\n\n-2m + 2m = 0\n\n36 - 12 = 24\n\nSo, 2x^2 - 12x + 24 = 14\n\nSubtract 14:\n\n2x^2 - 12x + 10 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 5 or x = 1\n\nTherefore, x = 5 or x = 1\n\nSo, if x = 5, then y = 1\n\nIf x = 1, then y = 5\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: x = 5, y = 1\n\nCase 2: x = 1, y = 5\n\nLet me consider Case 1: x = 5, y = 1\n\nSo, a + b = 5, c + d = 1\n\nAlso, ab + cd = 6\n\nSo, ab = m, cd = n, with m + n = 6\n\nAlso, from E2 and E3:\n\nE2: ac + bd = 3\n\nE3: ad + bc = 2\n\nHmm, how can I relate these?\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the products ac + bd and ad + bc.\n\nLet me denote p = a + b = 5, q = c + d = 1\n\nAlso, ab = m, cd = n = 6 - m\n\nNow, let's compute ac + bd.\n\nac + bd = a c + b d\n\nBut since c + d = 1, let me denote c = 1 - d\n\nSo, ac + bd = a(1 - d) + b d = a - a d + b d = a + d(b - a)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express ac + bd in terms of a, b, c, d.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider (a + c)(b + d) = ab + ad + bc + cd\n\nWhich is E1 + E3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSimilarly, (a + d)(b + c) = ab + ac + bd + cd = E1 + E2 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nSo, (a + c)(b + d) = 8\n\n(a + d)(b + c) = 9\n\nBut from x = a + b = 5, y = c + d = 1\n\nSo, a + c = (a + b) + (c - b) = 5 + (c - b)\n\nWait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote s = a + c, t = b + d\n\nThen, s + t = a + c + b + d = (a + b) + (c + d) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAlso, from above, s * t = (a + c)(b + d) = 8\n\nSo, s + t = 6, s * t = 8\n\nSo, s and t are roots of the equation z^2 - 6z + 8 = 0\n\nWhich factors as (z - 2)(z - 4) = 0, so z = 2 or z = 4\n\nTherefore, s = 2, t = 4 or s = 4, t = 2\n\nSo, either a + c = 2 and b + d = 4, or a + c = 4 and b + d = 2\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the other product: (a + d)(b + c) = 9\n\nLet me denote u = a + d, v = b + c\n\nThen, u + v = a + d + b + c = (a + b) + (c + d) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAnd u * v = (a + d)(b + c) = 9\n\nSo, u and v are roots of z^2 - 6z + 9 = 0, which factors as (z - 3)^2 = 0, so u = v = 3\n\nTherefore, a + d = 3 and b + c = 3\n\nSo, now, in Case 1, we have:\n\nFrom s and t:\n\nEither a + c = 2 and b + d = 4, or a + c = 4 and b + d = 2\n\nAnd from u and v:\n\na + d = 3 and b + c = 3\n\nSo, let's take the first subcase: a + c = 2 and b + d = 4\n\nWe also have a + d = 3 and b + c = 3\n\nSo, let's write down the equations:\n\n1. a + c = 2\n\n2. b + d = 4\n\n3. a + d = 3\n\n4. b + c = 3\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: a + d = 3 => d = 3 - a\n\nFrom equation 1: a + c = 2 => c = 2 - a\n\nFrom equation 4: b + c = 3 => b = 3 - c = 3 - (2 - a) = 1 + a\n\nFrom equation 2: b + d = 4 => (1 + a) + (3 - a) = 4 => 4 = 4\n\nWhich is always true, so no new information.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc = 2 - a\n\nd = 3 - a\n\nb = 1 + a\n\nSo, all variables expressed in terms of a.\n\nNow, let's recall that ab + cd = 6\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nab = a*(1 + a) = a + a^2\n\ncd = (2 - a)*(3 - a) = (2)(3) - 2a - 3a + a^2 = 6 - 5a + a^2\n\nSo, ab + cd = (a + a^2) + (6 - 5a + a^2) = 2a^2 - 4a + 6\n\nSet equal to 6:\n\n2a^2 - 4a + 6 = 6\n\nSubtract 6:\n\n2a^2 - 4a = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n2a(a - 2) = 0\n\nSo, a = 0 or a = 2\n\nTherefore, two possibilities:\n\nSubcase 1.1: a = 0\n\nThen, c = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nd = 3 - 0 = 3\n\nb = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo,", "answer": "Układ ma cztery rozwiązania: \\( (a, b, c, d) = (0, 1, 2, 3), \\; (a, b, c, d) = (1, 0, 3, 2), \\; (a, b, c, d) = (2, 3, 0, 1), \\; (a, b, c, d) = (3, 2, 1, 0) \\).\n\nZ pierwszego i drugiego równania wynika, że  \n\\[ (a + d)(b + c) = ab + cd + ac + bd = 6 + 3 = 9. \\]\n\nZ czwartego równania mamy \\( b + c = 6 - (a + d) \\).

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the equations, they all have a similar structure. Each one is a cubic term plus a product of two variables equals another product. Maybe I can manipulate them to find some relationships between a, b, and c.\n\nLet me write each equation again:\n\n1. \\( a^3 + b^2c = ac \\)\n2. \\( b^3 + c^2a = ba \\)\n3. \\( c^3 + a^2b = cb \\)\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange each equation to bring all terms to one side.\n\n1. \\( a^3 - ac + b^2c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( b^3 - ba + c^2a = 0 \\)\n3. \\( c^3 - cb + a^2b = 0 \\)\n\nLooking at these, I notice that each equation has a term with a cubic variable, a term with the product of two variables, and another term with the product of two variables. Maybe I can factor something out.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( a^3 - ac + b^2c = 0 \\)\n\nI can factor out an 'a' from the first two terms:\n\n\\( a(a^2 - c) + b^2c = 0 \\)\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor differently. Alternatively, let's see if I can express each equation in terms of a, b, c.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe subtract the equations from each other to find some relationships.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\( (b^3 + c^2a - ba) - (a^3 + b^2c - ac) = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b^3 - a^3 + c^2a - b^2c - ba + ac = 0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\nFirst, \\( b^3 - a^3 = (b - a)(b^2 + ab + a^2) \\)\n\nThen, \\( c^2a - b^2c = c(c a - b^2) \\)\n\nAnd, \\( -ba + ac = a(c - b) \\)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\( (b - a)(b^2 + ab + a^2) + c(c a - b^2) + a(c - b) = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case where a = b = c. Maybe that's a solution.\n\nIf a = b = c = k, then substituting into the first equation:\n\n\\( k^3 + k^2 * k = k * k \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( k^3 + k^3 = k^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2k^3 = k^2 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by k^2 (assuming k ≠ 0):\n\n\\( 2k = 1 \\) => \\( k = 1/2 \\)\n\nIf k = 0, then all variables are zero. So, (0, 0, 0) is a solution, and (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is another.\n\nBut are there other solutions where a, b, c are not all equal?\n\nLet me check if a, b, c can be zero in some variables.\n\nCase 1: Suppose a = 0.\n\nThen, substitute a = 0 into the first equation:\n\n\\( 0 + b^2c = 0 * c \\) => \\( b^2c = 0 \\)\n\nSo, either b = 0 or c = 0.\n\nSubcase 1a: a = 0, b = 0.\n\nThen, substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( 0 + c^2 * 0 = 0 * a \\) => 0 = 0, which is always true.\n\nThird equation: \\( c^3 + 0 = c * 0 \\) => \\( c^3 = 0 \\) => c = 0.\n\nSo, in this subcase, a = b = c = 0.\n\nSubcase 1b: a = 0, c = 0.\n\nThen, substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( b^3 + 0 = b * 0 \\) => \\( b^3 = 0 \\) => b = 0.\n\nSo again, a = b = c = 0.\n\nSo, if a = 0, then all variables must be zero.\n\nCase 2: Suppose b = 0.\n\nSimilarly, substitute b = 0 into the second equation:\n\n\\( 0 + c^2a = 0 * a \\) => \\( c^2a = 0 \\)\n\nSo, either c = 0 or a = 0.\n\nSubcase 2a: b = 0, c = 0.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + 0 = a * 0 \\) => \\( a^3 = 0 \\) => a = 0.\n\nSubcase 2b: b = 0, a = 0.\n\nThen, substitute into the third equation:\n\n\\( c^3 + 0 = c * 0 \\) => \\( c^3 = 0 \\) => c = 0.\n\nAgain, all variables zero.\n\nCase 3: Suppose c = 0.\n\nSubstitute c = 0 into the third equation:\n\n\\( 0 + a^2b = 0 * b \\) => \\( a^2b = 0 \\)\n\nSo, either a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nSubcase 3a: c = 0, a = 0.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\( 0 + b^2 * 0 = 0 * c \\) => 0 = 0.\n\nSecond equation: \\( b^3 + 0 = b * 0 \\) => \\( b^3 = 0 \\) => b = 0.\n\nSubcase 3b: c = 0, b = 0.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + 0 = a * 0 \\) => \\( a^3 = 0 \\) => a = 0.\n\nSo, again, all variables zero.\n\nSo, in all cases where any one variable is zero, all variables must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the only solution with a zero is (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where none of a, b, c are zero.

Maybe I can substitute these expressions into each other.\n\nLet me substitute c from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: c = a^3 / (a - b^2)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n\\( b^3 = a(b - (a^3 / (a - b^2))^2 ) \\)\n\nThis looks messy, but let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute c^2:\n\n\\( c^2 = (a^3 / (a - b^2))^2 = a^6 / (a - b^2)^2 \\)\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n\\( b^3 = a \\left( b - \\frac{a^6}{(a - b^2)^2} \\right) \\)\n\nMultiply through:\n\n\\( b^3 = ab - \\frac{a^7}{(a - b^2)^2} \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( \\frac{a^7}{(a - b^2)^2} = ab - b^3 \\)\n\nFactor the right side:\n\n\\( ab - b^3 = b(a - b^2) \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{a^7}{(a - b^2)^2} = b(a - b^2) \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by (a - b^2)^2:\n\n\\( a^7 = b(a - b^2)^3 \\)\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can assume that a = b = c, which we already did, but perhaps there are other symmetric solutions.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe all variables are equal, but not necessarily 1/2 or 0. Wait, we already saw that a = b = c = k gives k = 0 or k = 1/2.\n\nBut maybe there are other solutions where a, b, c are not equal but related in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider ratios between a, b, c.\n\nLet me define ratios: let’s say a = k * b, and b = m * c, so a = k * m * c.\n\nBut this might complicate things further. Alternatively, maybe set a = b, and see if that leads somewhere.\n\nAssume a = b.\n\nThen, substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + a^2c = a c \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a^3 + a^2c - a c = 0 \\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\( a(a^2 + a c - c) = 0 \\)\n\nSince a ≠ 0, we have:\n\n\\( a^2 + a c - c = 0 \\) => \\( a^2 = c(1 - a) \\)\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + c^2a = a a \\) => \\( a^3 + a c^2 = a^2 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by a (since a ≠ 0):\n\n\\( a^2 + c^2 = a \\)\n\nThird equation:\n\n\\( c^3 + a^2a = c a \\) => \\( c^3 + a^3 = a c \\)\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. \\( a^2 = c(1 - a) \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + c^2 = a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 + a^3 = a c \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( c = \\frac{a^2}{1 - a} \\)\n\nSubstitute c into equation 2:\n\n\\( a^2 + \\left( \\frac{a^2}{1 - a} \\right)^2 = a \\)\n\nCompute \\( \\left( \\frac{a^2}{1 - a} \\right)^2 = \\frac{a^4}{(1 - a)^2} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a^2 + \\frac{a^4}{(1 - a)^2} = a \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - a)^2:\n\n\\( a^2(1 - a)^2 + a^4 = a(1 - a)^2 \\)\n\nExpand \\( (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a^2(1 - 2a + a^2) + a^4 = a(1 - 2a + a^2) \\)\n\nMultiply out:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\( a^2 - 2a^3 + a^4 + a^4 = a^2 - 2a^3 + 2a^4 \\)\n\nRight side:\n\n\\( a - 2a^2 + a^3 \\)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n\\( a^2 - 2a^3 + 2a^4 - a + 2a^2 - a^3 = 0 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- a^4: 2a^4\n- a^3: -2a^3 - a^3 = -3a^3\n- a^2: a^2 + 2a^2 = 3a^2\n- a: -a\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 2a^4 - 3a^3 + 3a^2 - a = 0 \\)\n\nFactor out an 'a':\n\n\\( a(2a^3 - 3a^2 + 3a - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nSince a ≠ 0, we have:\n\n\\( 2a^3 - 3a^2 + 3a - 1 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me try to factor this cubic equation.\n\nPossible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2.\n\nTest a = 1:\n\n2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 2 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 1 ≠ 0\n\nTest a = 1/2:\n\n2(1/2)^3 - 3(1/2)^2 + 3(1/2) - 1 = 2(1/8) - 3(1/4) + 3/2 - 1 = 1/4 - 3/4 + 3/2 - 1\n\nCompute:\n\n1/4 - 3/4 = -1/2\n\n3/2 - 1 = 1/2\n\nSo, total: -1/2 + 1/2 = 0\n\nSo, a = 1", "answer": "\\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), \\ (a, b, c) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right).\\)  \n\nJeśli \\(a = 0\\), to z drugiego równania otrzymujemy \\(b = 0\\).  \nPodobnie, jeśli \\(b = 0\\), to z trzeciego równania dostajemy \\(c = 0\\), a jeśli  \n\\(c = 0\\), to pierwsze równanie daje \\(a = 0\\).

The condition is that for any two marked points (x, y) and (x', y'), at least one of the following must be true:\n\n1. x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10\n2. x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10\n\nHmm, let me try to understand what this condition means. It seems like it's saying that for any two points, they can't both be too far apart in both the x and y directions. Specifically, if one point is to the left and below the other, it can't be more than 10 units away in both coordinates. Otherwise, the other point would have to be within 10 units in both coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to rephrase the condition. If I have two points, they can't both be more than 10 units apart in both x and y. So, if one point is more than 10 units to the right and above another point, then the other point must be within 10 units to the right and above the first point. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think in terms of forbidden configurations. If I have a point (x, y), then any other point (x', y') that is more than 10 units to the right and above (x, y) would violate the first condition. Similarly, if (x', y') is more than 10 units to the left and below (x, y), it would violate the second condition. So, essentially, for any point, there can't be another point that is both more than 10 units to the right and above, or more than 10 units to the left and below.\n\nWait, no, actually, the condition is that for any two points, at least one of the two conditions must hold. So, if one point is more than 10 units to the right and above another, then the other point must be within 10 units to the right and above the first. But that seems a bit circular.\n\nMaybe another approach: think of the grid as being divided into blocks or regions where points can be placed without violating the condition. If I can figure out how to arrange points such that they don't violate the condition, then I can maximize the number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is related to graph theory. If I model each point as a vertex, and draw edges between points that violate the condition, then the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. But maximum independent set is generally hard, so maybe there's a structure here that allows for a better solution.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to a grid where each point can \"block\" a certain area around it. If I place a point, it blocks the area where another point can't be placed if it's more than 10 units away in both directions. So, perhaps the grid can be divided into regions where each region can contain at most one point.\n\nBut how big are these regions? If a point blocks a 10x10 area around it, then the number of such regions would be roughly (106/10)^2, but since 106 isn't a multiple of 10, it's a bit more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of shifting patterns. For example, if I place points every 11 units in both x and y directions, that might prevent them from being too far apart. But I need to check if that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, if I place points every 11 units, then the distance between any two points in the same row or column would be at least 11, which is more than 10. But the condition isn't about being in the same row or column, it's about both coordinates. So, if two points are in the same row but 11 units apart, then for condition (1), x' - x = 11, so x > x' -10 would be x > x -10, which is always true, but y > y' -10 would require y > y -10, which is also always true. So, condition (1) would hold because x > x' -10 is x > x -10, which is true, and y > y' -10 is also true. Wait, no, if x' = x +11, then x > x' -10 is x > x +1, which is false. Similarly, y > y' -10 is y > y +1, which is false. So, condition (1) is not satisfied. Similarly, condition (2) would be x' > x -10, which is x +11 > x -10, which is true, and y' > y -10, which is also true. So, condition (2) is satisfied because x' > x -10 and y' > y -10. So, in this case, condition (2) holds, so it's okay.\n\nWait, so if two points are 11 units apart in the same row, condition (2) is satisfied because x' = x +11 > x -10, which is true, and y' = y > y -10, which is also true. So, that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, if two points are 11 units apart in the same column, condition (1) would be satisfied because y > y' -10, which is y > y -10, true, and x > x' -10, which is x > x -10, also true. Wait, no, if y' = y +11, then y > y' -10 is y > y +1, which is false. Similarly, x > x' -10 is x > x -11, which is true. So, condition (2) would be x' > x -10, which is x +11 > x -10, true, and y' > y -10, which is y +11 > y -10, true. So, condition (2) holds.\n\nSo, placing points every 11 units in both x and y directions seems to satisfy the condition. But is this the maximum?\n\nWait, if I can place a point every 11 units, that would give me 10 points along each axis (since 106 /11 is approximately 9.63, so 10 points). So, 10x10=100 points. But maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging the points in a checkerboard pattern, but with a larger period. Wait, but the condition is about both coordinates, so maybe a grid where each point is spaced 11 apart in both x and y.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the problem is similar to placing points such that no two points are more than 10 units apart in both x and y. So, in other words, the maximum distance in both x and y between any two points is 10. But that's not exactly the condition.\n\nWait, the condition is that for any two points, at least one of the two conditions must hold. So, if one point is more than 10 units to the right and above another, then the other point must be within 10 units to the right and above the first. So, it's a kind of mutual condition.\n\nThis seems similar to a concept in graph theory called a \"dominating set,\" where each point must be within a certain distance of another. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to a grid where each point can \"cover\" a certain area around it, and we need to cover the entire grid with these covered areas.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: if I divide the grid into smaller blocks where each block can contain at most one point. Then, the number of blocks would give the maximum number of points.\n\nIf I divide the grid into 11x11 blocks, then each block can contain at most one point, because if two points are in the same block, their x and y differences would be less than 11, so the conditions would hold. But wait, actually, the condition is about being more than 10 apart, so if two points are in the same block, their differences are less than 11, so the conditions would hold because x > x' -10 would be x > x' -10, which is x - x' > -10, which is always true since x and x' are in the same block, so x - x' is less than 11, so x - x' > -10 is true. Similarly for y.\n\nWait, no, if two points are in the same block, their x and y differences are less than 11, so x > x' -10 is equivalent to x - x' > -10, which is always true because x - x' is greater than -10 (since x' is at least x -10). Similarly, y > y' -10 is always true. So, condition (1) is satisfied. Similarly, condition (2) would also be satisfied because x' > x -10 is x' - x > -10, which is true, and y' > y -10 is also true.\n\nSo, if I divide the grid into 11x11 blocks, each block can contain at most one point, and the total number of blocks would be (106 /11)^2, which is approximately (9.63)^2, so 9x9=81 blocks, but since 106=11*9 +7, so actually, it's 10 blocks along each axis, so 10x10=100 blocks. Therefore, the maximum number of points would be 100.\n\nBut wait, 106 divided by 11 is approximately 9.63, so we can fit 10 blocks along each axis, each of size 11, but the last block would be smaller. So, the number of blocks is 10x10=100, so 100 points.\n\nBut is this the maximum? Or can we do better?\n\nWait, if we arrange the points in a grid where each point is 11 units apart, we can fit 10 points along each axis, giving 100 points. But maybe we can arrange the points in a way that allows more than 100 points without violating the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is 106*106 / (11*11) ≈ 100, so 100 is the maximum.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have a grid where each point is 11 units apart, then any two points are at least 11 units apart in either x or y direction, but the condition is about being more than 10 units apart in both. So, if two points are 11 units apart in both x and y, then condition (1) is x > x' -10, which is x - x' > -10, which is true because x - x' = -11, which is greater than -10? Wait, no, -11 is less than -10, so x > x' -10 would be x > x' -10, which is x - x' > -10. Since x - x' = -11, which is not greater than -10, so condition (1) is not satisfied. Similarly, condition (2) is x' > x -10, which is x' - x > -10, which is true because x' - x = 11, which is greater than -10. Similarly, y' > y -10 is true. So, condition (2) is satisfied because x' > x -10 and y' > y -10.\n\nSo, in this case, two points 11 units apart in both x and y satisfy condition (2), so it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, arranging points every 11 units in both x and y directions gives us 100 points, and this satisfies the condition.\n\nBut can we do better? Let's see. Suppose we try to place more than 100 points. Let's say 101 points. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, since we have 106x106 grid, if we have 101 points, at least two points must be within 10 units in both x and y directions. Wait, is that necessarily true?\n\nWait, no, because the grid is 106x106, and if we divide it into 10x10 blocks of 11x11, each block can contain at most one point. So, 10x10=100 blocks, so 100 points. If we try to place 101 points, at least two points must be in the same block, which would mean they are within 10 units in both x and y. But then, do they violate the condition?\n\nIf two points are within 10 units in both x and y, then condition (1) is x > x' -10 and y > y' -10. If point A is (x, y) and point B is (x', y') where x' = x + a, y' = y + b, with a, b <=10, then condition (1) is x > x' -10, which is x > x + a -10, so 0 > a -10, which is a <10. Similarly, y > y' -10, which is y > y + b -10, so 0 > b -10, which is b <10. So, if a and b are both less than 10, then condition (1) is satisfied. Similarly, condition (2) would be x' > x -10 and y' > y -10, which is x + a > x -10, which is a > -10, which is always true, and y + b > y -10, which is b > -10, also always true. So, condition (2) is satisfied.\n\nWait, so if two points are within 10 units in both x and y, condition (2) is automatically satisfied because x' > x -10 is always true (since x' >= x -10) and y' > y -10 is also always true. So, even if two points are within 10 units in both directions, condition (2) is satisfied, so it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, having two points within 10 units in both directions is allowed because condition (2) holds. So, the previous reasoning about the 11x11 grid is not necessarily the only way.\n\nHmm, so maybe the maximum number of points is higher than 100.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent", "answer": "**Niech** \\( X \\) **będzie zbiorem spełniającym warunki zadania.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that for a given integer \\(n \\geq 2\\), we have real numbers \\(a_{ij}\\) where \\(1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\). The key condition is that for any choice of \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) each being either -1 or 1, the sum \\(\\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} a_{ij}x_i x_j\\) must be either -1 or 1. My task is to determine the largest possible number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\) pairs depending on \\(n\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to maximize the number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\) such that the given quadratic form always evaluates to either -1 or 1, regardless of the choices of \\(x_i\\).\n\nLet me think about what this quadratic form represents. It's a sum over all pairs \\(i < j\\) of \\(a_{ij}x_i x_j\\). So, if I consider the vector \\(x = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)\\), this sum can be written as \\(x^T A x\\), where \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal and \\(a_{ij}\\) on the off-diagonal entries for \\(i \\neq j\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, since \\(a_{ij}\\) is only defined for \\(i < j\\), the matrix \\(A\\) is an upper triangular matrix with zeros on the diagonal. However, since the quadratic form is symmetric, the matrix \\(A\\) is symmetric, so the lower triangle entries are just the transpose of the upper triangle. So, effectively, \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal and \\(a_{ij}\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\).\n\nBut in our case, the quadratic form is given by \\(\\sum_{i < j} a_{ij}x_i x_j\\), which is exactly the same as \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^T A x\\) because the standard quadratic form includes all pairs \\(i \\neq j\\), but here we only have \\(i < j\\). So, to make it consistent, we can write the quadratic form as \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^T A x\\), where \\(A\\) is symmetric with zeros on the diagonal.\n\nBut the problem states that this quadratic form must be either -1 or 1 for any choice of \\(x_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\). So, the value of \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^T A x\\) must be either -1 or 1. Therefore, \\(x^T A x\\) must be either -2 or 2.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, \\(x^T A x \\in \\{-2, 2\\}\\) for all \\(x \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^n\\). So, the quadratic form is constrained to take only two values: -2 and 2.\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\) such that this condition holds. Let me think about what properties \\(A\\) must have.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\(n = 2\\). Then, we have only one pair \\(a_{12}\\). The quadratic form is \\(a_{12}x_1 x_2\\). Since \\(x_1, x_2 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\), \\(x_1 x_2\\) can be either 1 or -1. Therefore, \\(a_{12}x_1 x_2\\) must be either -1 or 1. So, \\(a_{12}\\) must be either 1 or -1. Therefore, the maximum number of non-zero pairs is 1, which is trivial.\n\nBut for larger \\(n\\), the problem becomes more complex. Let me try \\(n = 3\\). Then, we have three pairs: \\(a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}\\). The quadratic form is \\(a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{13}x_1x_3 + a_{23}x_2x_3\\). We need this sum to be either -1 or 1 for all possible combinations of \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\).\n\nLet me consider all possible assignments of \\(x_i\\). There are \\(2^3 = 8\\) possible assignments. For each assignment, the quadratic form must be either -1 or 1. Let me see if I can find such \\(a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}\\).\n\nSuppose all \\(a_{ij} = 1\\). Then, the quadratic form becomes \\(x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3\\). Let's compute this for different \\(x_i\\):\n\n1. \\(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1\\): \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\). But 3 is not in \\{-1, 1\\}, so this doesn't work.\n2. So, all \\(a_{ij} = 1\\) is invalid.\n\nWhat if two of them are 1 and one is -1? Let's say \\(a_{12} = 1\\), \\(a_{13} = 1\\), \\(a_{23} = -1\\). Then, the quadratic form is \\(x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 - x_2x_3\\).\n\nTesting some assignments:\n\n1. \\(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1\\): \\(1 + 1 - 1 = 1\\). Good.\n2. \\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -1\\): \\(1 + (-1) - (-1) = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1\\). Good.\n3. \\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = 1\\): \\(-1 + 1 - (-1) = -1 + 1 + 1 = 1\\). Good.\n4. \\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = -1\\): \\(-1 + (-1) - (1) = -1 -1 -1 = -3\\). Not good.\n\nHmm, so this assignment doesn't work either.\n\nMaybe another combination. Let's try \\(a_{12} = 1\\), \\(a_{13} = -1\\), \\(a_{23} = 1\\). Then, the quadratic form is \\(x_1x_2 - x_1x_3 + x_2x_3\\).\n\nTesting:\n\n1. All 1s: \\(1 - 1 + 1 = 1\\). Good.\n2. \\(x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=-1\\): \\(1 - (-1) + (-1) = 1 +1 -1 =1\\). Good.\n3. \\(x_1=1, x_2=-1, x_3=1\\): \\(-1 -1 + (-1) = -3\\). Not good.\n\nHmm, still not working.\n\nWait, maybe all \\(a_{ij}\\) cannot be 1 or -1. Maybe some are 1 and some are -1, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic form must be a constant function, but in this case, it's not constant, it's either -1 or 1. So, it's a function that takes two values depending on the input.\n\nWait, but for \\(n=3\\), the number of possible quadratic forms is limited. Maybe I can think in terms of Hadamard matrices or something similar.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the quadratic form \\(Q(x) = \\sum_{i < j} a_{ij}x_i x_j\\). We know that \\(Q(x) \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\) for all \\(x \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^n\\). So, \\(Q(x)\\) is a function from the hypercube to \\{-1, 1\\}.\n\nI recall that such functions can be represented as linear combinations of products of variables, but in this case, it's a quadratic form.\n\nWait, but quadratic forms can be analyzed using eigenvalues. The maximum and minimum values of \\(Q(x)\\) over the hypercube are related to the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(A\\). But in our case, \\(Q(x)\\) is constrained to only take two values, so the maximum and minimum must be exactly -1 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum eigenvalue of \\(A\\) must be 1, and the minimum eigenvalue must be -1. Because the maximum value of \\(Q(x)\\) is 1 and the minimum is -1.\n\nBut wait, actually, the maximum value of \\(Q(x)\\) is equal to the maximum eigenvalue of \\(A\\), and the minimum is equal to the minimum eigenvalue. So, if \\(Q(x)\\) is constrained to be in \\{-1, 1\\}, then the maximum eigenvalue is 1 and the minimum eigenvalue is -1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix \\(A\\) must be a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues bounded between -1 and 1, and in fact, achieving exactly -1 and 1 as their extremal eigenvalues.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of non-zero entries in \\(A\\)?\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think about the rank of the matrix \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) has rank \\(r\\), then the number of non-zero eigenvalues is \\(r\\). But since all eigenvalues are bounded between -1 and 1, and the maximum and minimum are exactly 1 and -1, the rank might be related to the number of non-zero entries.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider the case when \\(n=3\\). If I can find a quadratic form with three non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\) that satisfies the condition, then maybe the maximum is 3. But from my earlier attempts, it seems difficult.\n\nWait, let's try another combination. Suppose \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=1\\). Then, as I saw earlier, when all \\(x_i=1\\), the sum is 3, which is outside \\{-1,1\\}. So that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if two are 1 and one is -1? Let's say \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=-1\\). Then, as I saw earlier, when \\(x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=-1\\), the sum is \\(1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(1) = -1 -1 -1 = -3\\), which is bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=-1\\), \\(a_{23}=1\\). Then, when \\(x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=-1\\), the sum is \\(1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 1*(1) = -1 +1 +1=1\\). When \\(x_1=1, x_2=-1, x_3=1\\), the sum is \\(-1*(-1) + (-1)*1 + 1*(-1) =1 -1 -1=-1\\).

But in my attempts, even with two non-zero entries, it's not working because when all \\(x_i=1\\), the sum can be 2 or -2, which is outside the allowed range.\n\nWait, hold on.

", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about finding all pairs of positive integers m and n for which there exists a \"good\" function f from A_{m,n} to A_{m,n}. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what A_{m,n} is. It's defined as the set of vectors (k, l) where k ranges from 0 to m-1 and l ranges from 0 to n-1. So, essentially, A_{m,n} is a grid of points with m columns and n rows. For example, if m=2 and n=3, A_{2,3} would be the set {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)}.\n\nNow, the function f: A_{m,n} → A_{m,n} is called \"good\" if it satisfies two conditions:\n\n1. f is injective (one-to-one). So, each element in A_{m,n} maps to a unique element in A_{m,n}, meaning no two different vectors map to the same vector.\n\n2. The second condition is a bit more complex. It says that if for any two vectors v and w in A_{m,n}, the difference v + f(v) - w - f(w) equals (am, bn) for some integers a and b, then it must be that v = w. So, if the difference between v + f(v) and w + f(w) is a multiple of (m, 0) in the first component and (0, n) in the second component, then v and w must be the same vector.\n\nHmm, that's a bit abstract. Maybe I can rephrase it. The condition is saying that the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is injective modulo (m, n). In other words, if two vectors v and w have the same image under this mapping modulo (m, n), then they must be equal. So, the function v ↦ v + f(v) is injective when considered modulo m in the first component and modulo n in the second component.\n\nSince A_{m,n} has m*n elements, and the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is injective modulo (m, n), it must also be surjective modulo (m, n). Because an injective function from a finite set to itself is necessarily bijective. So, the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is a bijection on A_{m,n} when considered modulo (m, n).\n\nWait, but actually, A_{m,n} is a grid, so maybe it's better to think in terms of toroidal grids, where moving beyond the boundaries wraps around. But in this case, the function f is mapping within the grid, not wrapping around. So, the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) must be such that each vector in A_{m,n} is hit exactly once when considered modulo m and n.\n\nBut since we're dealing with vectors, the addition is component-wise. So, for each vector v = (k, l), f(v) = (k', l'), then v + f(v) = (k + k', l + l'). The condition is that if (k + k' - (k'' + k'')) ≡ 0 mod m and (l + l' - (l'' + l'')) ≡ 0 mod n, then (k, l) = (k'', l''). So, the mapping (k, l) ↦ (k + k', l + l') is injective modulo m and n.\n\nAlternatively, this can be thought of as the function f being such that the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is a permutation of A_{m,n} when considered modulo m and n. So, for each vector, adding it to its image under f gives a unique result modulo m and n.\n\nBut how does this relate to f being injective? Well, condition (1) says f is injective, which is a standard requirement for a permutation. So, f is a permutation of A_{m,n}, and the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation.\n\nSo, we need a permutation f of A_{m,n} such that the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation. That seems like a strong condition.\n\nLet me think about small cases to get some intuition.\n\nCase 1: m = 1, n = 1.\n\nA_{1,1} has only one vector: (0,0). The function f must map (0,0) to itself. Then, v + f(v) = (0,0) + (0,0) = (0,0). So, the mapping is trivially injective. So, (1,1) is a valid pair.\n\nCase 2: m = 2, n = 1.\n\nA_{2,1} has two vectors: (0,0) and (1,0). Let's see if a good function exists.\n\nWe need f to be injective, so f must map (0,0) to either (0,0) or (1,0), and similarly for (1,0). Let's try f((0,0)) = (1,0) and f((1,0)) = (0,0). Then, v + f(v) would be (0,0) + (1,0) = (1,0) and (1,0) + (0,0) = (1,0). So, both map to (1,0), which is not injective. So, this f is not good.\n\nAlternatively, if f is the identity function: f((0,0)) = (0,0) and f((1,0)) = (1,0). Then, v + f(v) would be (0,0) and (1,0), which is injective. So, this f is good. So, (2,1) is a valid pair.\n\nWait, so for m=2, n=1, the identity function works. So, (2,1) is okay.\n\nCase 3: m=2, n=2.\n\nA_{2,2} has four vectors: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nWe need a permutation f such that v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation.\n\nLet me try the identity function again. Then, v + f(v) would be (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). But in A_{2,2}, the coordinates are modulo 2, so (0,2) is equivalent to (0,0), and (2,0) is equivalent to (0,0). So, the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) would map all vectors to (0,0), which is definitely not injective. So, the identity function doesn't work here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another permutation. Let's try f((0,0)) = (1,1), f((1,1)) = (0,0), f((0,1)) = (1,0), f((1,0)) = (0,1). So, f is swapping (0,0) with (1,1) and swapping (0,1) with (1,0).\n\nThen, v + f(v) would be:\n\n(0,0) + (1,1) = (1,1)\n\n(1,1) + (0,0) = (1,1)\n\n(0,1) + (1,0) = (1,1)\n\n(1,0) + (0,1) = (1,1)\n\nSo, all vectors map to (1,1), which is not injective. So, this f is not good.\n\nHmm, maybe another permutation. Let's try f((0,0)) = (0,1), f((0,1)) = (0,0), f((1,0)) = (1,1), f((1,1)) = (1,0). Then, v + f(v) would be:\n\n(0,0) + (0,1) = (0,1)\n\n(0,1) + (0,0) = (0,1)\n\n(1,0) + (1,1) = (2,1) ≡ (0,1) mod 2\n\n(1,1) + (1,0) = (2,1) ≡ (0,1) mod 2\n\nAgain, all map to (0,1). Not injective.\n\nWait, maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about the mapping v ↦ v + f(v). For this to be injective, each vector must map to a unique vector. So, in the case of m=2, n=2, the mapping must be a permutation of the four vectors.\n\nBut when I tried the identity function, it didn't work because adding v and f(v) gave duplicates. Maybe I need a different permutation.\n\nLet me try f((0,0)) = (0,0), f((0,1)) = (1,0), f((1,0)) = (0,1), f((1,1)) = (1,1). So, f is swapping (0,1) and (1,0), and leaving (0,0) and (1,1) fixed.\n\nThen, v + f(v):\n\n(0,0) + (0,0) = (0,0)\n\n(0,1) + (1,0) = (1,1)\n\n(1,0) + (0,1) = (1,1)\n\n(1,1) + (1,1) = (2,2) ≡ (0,0) mod 2\n\nSo, (0,0) and (1,1) both map to (0,0) and (1,1), but (0,1) and (1,0) both map to (1,1). So, duplicates again. Not injective.\n\nHmm, maybe it's impossible for m=2, n=2? Let me see.\n\nSuppose such a function f exists. Then, the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) must be a permutation. So, each vector must be hit exactly once.\n\nBut in A_{2,2}, the sum v + f(v) can be:\n\n(0,0) + f((0,0)) = ?\n\n(0,1) + f((0,1)) = ?\n\n(1,0) + f((1,0)) = ?\n\n(1,1) + f((1,1)) = ?\n\nEach of these sums must be distinct modulo 2.\n\nBut let's note that the sum of all vectors in A_{2,2} is (0+0+1+1, 0+1+0+1) = (2, 2) ≡ (0,0) mod 2.\n\nIf the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is a permutation, then the sum of all images is equal to the sum of all vectors in A_{2,2}, which is (0,0). But the sum of all images is also equal to the sum of all v + f(v) for v in A_{2,2}.\n\nWhich is equal to sum(v) + sum(f(v)) = sum(v) + sum(v) = 2*sum(v) ≡ 0 mod 2, since 2 is 0 mod 2. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut does that help? Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the function f as a permutation matrix. For the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) to be a permutation, the permutation must satisfy certain properties.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to Latin squares or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function f can be represented as a linear transformation. If f is linear, then f(v) = Av for some matrix A. Then, v + f(v) = (I + A)v. For this to be a permutation, (I + A) must be invertible modulo m and n.\n\nBut since m and n are not necessarily coprime, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but in the case of m=2, n=2, if f is linear, then f(v) = Av, where A is a 2x2 matrix. Then, (I + A) must be invertible modulo 2. The determinant of (I + A) must be non-zero modulo 2.\n\nBut let's see. For m=2, n=2, the determinant modulo 2 must be 1. So, possible matrices A where (I + A) has determinant 1 mod 2.\n\nBut let's see if such a matrix exists. For example, if A is the identity matrix, then (I + A) would have determinant (1+1)(1+1) = 0 mod 2, which is bad. If A is the zero matrix, then (I + A) is I, determinant 1. But then f is the zero function, which is not injective because f(v) = (0,0) for all v, which is definitely not injective.\n\nAlternatively, if A is a permutation matrix, say swapping the two coordinates. Then, (I + A) would be a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the off-diagonal. Its determinant is (1*1 - 1*1) = 0 mod 2. So, that's not invertible.\n\nHmm, maybe linear functions aren't the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f is a translation. But since f is a permutation, it can't be a translation unless it's a cyclic shift, but in two dimensions, that might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of group theory. A_{m,n} is a group under addition modulo m and n. So, it's isomorphic to Z_m × Z_n. The function f is a permutation of this group, and the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation.\n\nSo, we're looking for a permutation f such that the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation. In group theory terms, this is equivalent to saying that f is a permutation and the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is a permutation. So, f is a permutation such that the mapping is a permutation.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a complete mapping in group theory. A complete mapping is a permutation f such that the mapping v ↦ v + f(v) is also a permutation. So, in this case, we're dealing with a complete mapping on the group Z_m × Z_n.\n\nSo, the question reduces to: for which m, n is the group Z_m × Z_n admits a complete mapping?\n\nI remember that for abelian groups, a complete mapping exists if and only if the Sylow 2-subgroup is trivial or non-cyclic. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, actually, I think that in abelian groups, complete mappings exist if and only if the group has no nontrivial cyclic Sylow 2-subgroup. That is, the Sylow 2", "answer": "Parę \\( (n, m) \\) nazwiemy dobrą, jeśli istnieje dobra funkcja \\( f : A_{n,m} \\to A_{n,m} \\).

Then \\( A_2 \\) could be from (1,1) to (2,2), overlapping with \\( B_1 \\), and \\( B_2 \\) from (0,0) to (1,1), overlapping with \\( A_1 \\).

Wait, that's a problem because \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) should be disjoint.\n\nHmm, maybe adjust the strips so that they don't overlap. Let me make \\( A_1 \\) from x=0-1, y=0-3, \\( A_2 \\) from x=1-2, y=0-3, \\( A_3 \\) from x=2-3, y=0-3.\n\nSimilarly, \\( B_1 \\) from x=0-3, y=0-1, \\( B_2 \\) from x=0-3, y=1-2, \\( B_3 \\) from x=0-3, y=2-3.\n\nNow, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) would intersect at the corner (i, i), but since the rectangles are closed, they actually do intersect at that point. So, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) are not disjoint, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, maybe shift the \\( B \\)s slightly. Let me make \\( B_1 \\) from x=0-3, y=0.5-1.5, \\( B_2 \\) from x=0-3, y=1.5-2.5, \\( B_3 \\) from x=0-3, y=2.5-3.5.\n\nNow, \\( A_1 \\) is x=0-1, y=0-3. So, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) intersect from x=0-1, y=0.5-1.5. Similarly, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) intersect from x=0-1, y=1.5-2.5, and \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_3 \\) intersect from x=0-1, y=2.5-3.5. So, \\( A_1 \\) intersects all \\( B_j \\), which is good.\n\nBut wait, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) do intersect, which is not allowed because they should be disjoint. So, this approach doesn't work.\n\nMaybe instead, arrange the \\( A \\)s and \\( B \\)s in a way that each \\( A_i \\) is in a different row and each \\( B_j \\) is in a different column, but shifted so that they don't overlap on the diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps using a checkerboard pattern? Or maybe arranging them in a grid where each \\( A_i \\) is in a different row and each \\( B_j \\) is in a different column, but shifted so that \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect.\n\nLet me try to define coordinates.\n\nLet’s define the plane with integer coordinates for simplicity.\n\nLet’s set \\( A_i \\) as the rectangle from (i, 0) to (i+1, 1) for i=1 to n.\n\nAnd \\( B_j \\) as the rectangle from (0, j) to (1, j+1) for j=1 to n.\n\nThen, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect if and only if i ≠ j. Because if i = j, then \\( A_i \\) is from (i,0) to (i+1,1), and \\( B_i \\) is from (0,i) to (1,i+1). Their intersection would be at (i, i), which is a point, but since the rectangles are closed, they do intersect at that point. So, again, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) intersect, which is not allowed.\n\nHmm, so maybe shift the \\( B \\)s so that they don't intersect the \\( A \\)s on the diagonal.\n\nLet me adjust the \\( B_j \\)s. Instead of starting at (0, j), maybe shift them slightly.\n\nLet’s define \\( B_j \\) as from (0, j+0.5) to (1, j+1.5). Then, \\( A_i \\) is from (i, 0) to (i+1, 1). So, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect if and only if i ≠ j. Because if i = j, \\( A_i \\) is from (i,0) to (i+1,1), and \\( B_i \\) is from (0, i+0.5) to (1, i+1.5). Their intersection would be at (i, i+0.5) to (i+1, i+1), but wait, actually, \\( A_i \\) only goes up to y=1, while \\( B_i \\) starts at y=i+0.5. So, if i=1, \\( B_1 \\) starts at y=1.5, which is above \\( A_1 \\)'s top at y=1. So, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) don't intersect. Similarly, for other i, \\( B_i \\) starts at y=i+0.5, which is above \\( A_i \\)'s top at y=1 if i >=1. So, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect, which is good.\n\nBut what about \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) for i ≠ j? Let's see. For example, \\( A_1 \\) is from (1,0) to (2,1). \\( B_2 \\) is from (0, 2.5) to (1, 3.5). So, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) don't intersect because \\( A_1 \\) is from y=0 to 1, and \\( B_2 \\) is from y=2.5 to 3.5. So, they don't overlap. Wait, that's a problem because we need \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) to intersect for all i ≠ j.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work because \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) for i ≠ j don't intersect.\n\nMaybe I need a different arrangement. Perhaps overlapping in both x and y directions but avoiding the diagonal.\n\nWait, maybe arrange the \\( A \\)s and \\( B \\)s in a grid where each \\( A_i \\) is in a different row and each \\( B_j \\) is in a different column, but shifted so that they don't overlap on the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different coordinate system. Let me think in terms of intervals.\n\nEach \\( A_i \\) can be represented as an interval on the x-axis and y-axis, and same for \\( B_j \\). The intersection of \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) is non-empty if their x-intervals overlap and their y-intervals overlap.\n\nSo, to have \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect for i ≠ j, but not intersect for i = j, we need that for each i, the x-interval of \\( A_i \\) does not overlap with the x-interval of \\( B_i \\), and similarly for y-intervals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's the intersection of both x and y intervals that needs to be non-empty for i ≠ j, and empty for i = j.\n\nSo, perhaps arrange the x-intervals and y-intervals such that for each i, \\( A_i \\)'s x-interval does not overlap with \\( B_i \\)'s x-interval, but overlaps with all other \\( B_j \\)'s x-intervals. Similarly for y-intervals.\n\nThis sounds like a problem related to interval graphs. Maybe arranging the intervals so that each \\( A_i \\) is \"avoiding\" \\( B_i \\) in both x and y.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange this? Let me think of it as two separate problems: one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.\n\nIf I can arrange the x-intervals such that \\( A_i \\) does not overlap with \\( B_i \\), but overlaps with all other \\( B_j \\), and similarly for y-intervals, then the rectangles will satisfy the required conditions.\n\nSo, for the x-axis, we need a set of intervals where each \\( A_i \\) does not overlap with \\( B_i \\), but overlaps with all \\( B_j \\) for j ≠ i. Similarly for the y-axis.\n\nThis is similar to a permutation where each element is not in its original position, but overlaps with all others.\n\nWait, maybe using a permutation where each \\( A_i \\) is placed in such a way that it avoids \\( B_i \\) but overlaps with others.\n\nAlternatively, think of the x-intervals as a set where each \\( A_i \\) is placed in a way that it doesn't overlap with \\( B_i \\), but overlaps with all others.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where you have two sets of intervals, and you want each interval in the first set to intersect all but one in the second set.\n\nI think this is related to the concept of \"non-overlapping\" and \"crossing\" intervals.\n\nWait, maybe arranging the x-intervals and y-intervals as follows:\n\nFor the x-axis, arrange \\( A_i \\)s and \\( B_j \\)s such that \\( A_i \\) is to the left of \\( B_i \\), and to the right of all other \\( B_j \\)s. Similarly, for the y-axis, \\( A_i \\) is below \\( B_i \\), and above all other \\( B_j \\)s.\n\nBut wait,", "answer": "Największą liczbą spełniającą warunki zadania jest *n = 4.* Poniższy rysunek przedstawia przykład dla *n = 4.*"}

Each number can be written in either red or blue. The goal is to figure out the maximum number of \"good\" pairs (i, j) where i ≤ j. A pair is good if, among the numbers from i to j, the number of odd numbers that are written in blue is even. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly constitutes a \"good\" pair. So, for any interval [i, j], we look at all the odd numbers within that interval. If the count of blue-colored odd numbers in that interval is even, then the pair (i, j) is considered good. \n\nJadzia can choose the color (red or blue) for each number from 1 to 2n-1. The task is to maximize the number of such good pairs. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can model this problem using some kind of binary representation or parity considerations. Since the condition is about the parity (evenness) of blue-colored odd numbers in an interval, perhaps using a prefix sum approach with parity might help.\n\nLet me denote each number from 1 to 2n-1 as either 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Then, for each odd number, we can associate a 1 if it's blue, and 0 if it's red. Now, for any interval [i, j], the number of blue odd numbers is the sum of the corresponding bits for the odd numbers in that interval. We need this sum to be even, i.e., congruent to 0 modulo 2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning 0s and 1s to the odd positions (since only odd numbers affect the condition) such that the number of intervals [i, j] where the sum of bits in the odd positions from i to j is even is maximized.\n\nWait, but actually, the interval [i, j] can include both even and odd numbers, but only the odd numbers in that interval contribute to the count. So, perhaps it's better to separate the problem into considering the odd and even numbers separately.\n\nBut since the condition only depends on the odd numbers, maybe we can focus on the odd positions and ignore the even ones? Or perhaps not, because the interval [i, j] can start and end on even numbers, encompassing some odd numbers in between.\n\nHmm, maybe I should model the problem as a binary string where each bit corresponds to an odd number, and the rest are don't care. But actually, the interval [i, j] can include both even and odd numbers, so the parity of the number of blue odd numbers in [i, j] depends only on the odd numbers in that interval.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem on the odd numbers only. Let me consider the odd numbers in the range 1 to 2n-1. There are n odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1.\n\nEach of these can be colored red (0) or blue (1). Now, for any interval [i, j], the number of blue odd numbers in [i, j] must be even. So, the problem is equivalent to assigning 0s and 1s to these n odd positions such that the number of intervals [i, j] where the sum of bits in the odd positions from i to j is even is maximized.\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes all numbers from 1 to 2n-1, not just the odd ones. So, the interval [i, j] can start and end anywhere, but only the odd numbers in that interval affect the condition. So, perhaps the key is to model the problem on the odd numbers, considering their positions and how they are included in various intervals.\n\nLet me think about the positions of the odd numbers. The odd numbers are at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1. So, their indices in the original sequence are 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1. Let me denote the odd numbers as O_1, O_2, ..., O_n, where O_k = 2k - 1.\n\nNow, any interval [i, j] in the original sequence can be represented by the set of odd numbers O_k such that i ≤ O_k ≤ j. So, the number of blue odd numbers in [i, j] is the sum of the bits assigned to O_k where O_k is in [i, j].\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to assigning bits to O_1, O_2, ..., O_n (each bit is 0 or 1) such that the number of intervals [i, j] where the sum of bits in O_k for O_k in [i, j] is even is maximized.\n\nBut how do we count the number of such intervals? Let's think about the number of intervals [i, j] in the original sequence. There are (2n-1) numbers, so the total number of intervals is (2n-1)(2n)/2. But we need to count how many of these intervals have an even number of blue odd numbers.\n\nWait, but the intervals can be of any length, starting and ending anywhere. So, each interval is determined by its start and end points. The number of intervals is indeed (2n-1)(2n)/2, but we need to find how many of these have an even number of blue odd numbers.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this as a binary string of length n, where each bit corresponds to an odd number, and then the number of intervals in the original sequence corresponds to the number of intervals in this binary string, but considering the positions of the bits.\n\nWait, no. Because the original sequence includes both odd and even numbers, but the intervals can start and end anywhere. So, the mapping isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a binary string where each position corresponds to an odd number, and the rest are don't care. Then, the number of intervals in the original sequence that include an even number of blue odd numbers is equivalent to the number of intervals in the binary string where the sum of bits is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case because the intervals in the original sequence can include even numbers, which don't affect the condition. So, perhaps the number of intervals in the original sequence that include an even number of blue odd numbers is equal to the number of intervals in the binary string (on the odd positions) that have an even number of 1s, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the even numbers in the interval.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of blue odd numbers in an interval. For each interval [i, j], the number of blue odd numbers is the sum of the bits assigned to the odd numbers in [i, j]. We need this sum to be even.\n\nSo, if we can model the problem as a binary string where each bit corresponds to an odd number, and we need the number of intervals where the sum is even. Then, the problem reduces to assigning 0s and 1s to the bits such that the number of intervals with even sum is maximized.\n\nBut how do we count the number of intervals with even sum? Let's recall that in a binary string, the number of intervals with even sum can be calculated using prefix sums.\n\nLet me denote S_k as the prefix sum up to the k-th odd number. Then, the sum of bits from O_i to O_j is S_j - S_{i-1}. We need this difference to be even. So, S_j ≡ S_{i-1} mod 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of intervals with even sum is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that S_j ≡ S_{i-1} mod 2. So, if we have c_0 zeros and c_1 ones in the prefix sums, the number of such pairs is c_0 choose 2 + c_1 choose 2.\n\nWait, that's a standard result. The number of intervals with even sum is equal to the number of pairs of indices with the same parity in the prefix sums.\n\nSo, if we have a binary string, the number of intervals with even sum is (number of even prefix sums choose 2) + (number of odd prefix sums choose 2). Because for each pair of prefix sums with the same parity, the interval between them will have an even sum.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of good pairs, we need to maximize (c_0 choose 2) + (c_1 choose 2), where c_0 + c_1 = n+1 (since the prefix sum starts at 0).\n\nWait, actually, the prefix sum S_0 is 0, and then S_1, S_2, ..., S_n. So, there are n+1 prefix sums. So, c_0 + c_1 = n+1.\n\nTherefore, the number of good pairs is (c_0 choose 2) + (c_1 choose 2). To maximize this, we need to choose c_0 and c_1 as equal as possible because the function f(c) = (c choose 2) + (n+1 - c choose 2) is maximized when c is as close to (n+1)/2 as possible.\n\nSo, if n+1 is even, then c_0 = c_1 = (n+1)/2, and the number of good pairs is 2 * ((n+1)/2 choose 2) = 2 * [(n+1)/2 * (n-1)/2 / 2] = (n+1)(n-1)/4.\n\nIf n+1 is odd, then c_0 = (n+2)/2 and c_1 = (n)/2, so the number of good pairs is ((n+2)/2 choose 2) + (n/2 choose 2) = [(n+2)(n)/8] + [n(n-2)/8] = [n(n+2) + n(n-2)] / 8 = [n^2 + 2n + n^2 - 2n] / 8 = (2n^2)/8 = n^2 / 4.\n\nWait, but let me compute that again.\n\nIf n+1 is even, say n+1 = 2k, then c_0 = c_1 = k. Then, (k choose 2) + (k choose 2) = 2 * [k(k-1)/2] = k(k-1). Since k = (n+1)/2, this becomes ((n+1)/2)((n+1)/2 - 1) = ((n+1)/2)((n-1)/2) = (n^2 - 1)/4.\n\nIf n+1 is odd, say n+1 = 2k + 1, then c_0 = k + 1, c_1 = k. Then, (k+1 choose 2) + (k choose 2) = [(k+1)k / 2] + [k(k-1)/2] = [k^2 + k + k^2 - k]/2 = (2k^2)/2 = k^2. Since n+1 = 2k + 1, k = (n)/2. So, k^2 = (n/2)^2 = n^2 / 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of good pairs is:\n\n- If n is odd: (n^2 - 1)/4\n- If n is even: n^2 / 4\n\nBut wait, let me check with small n.\n\nFor n=1: The numbers are 1. The possible pairs are (1,1). The number of blue odd numbers in [1,1] is either 0 or 1. So, if we color it blue, the pair is not good; if we color it red, the pair is good. So, maximum good pairs is 1. According to the formula, n=1 is odd, so (1 -1)/4 = 0, which is wrong. Hmm, so maybe my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, n=1: 2n-1=1, so only one number. The number of intervals is 1. If we color it red, the pair (1,1) is good. If we color it blue, it's not. So, maximum is 1. But according to the formula, for n=1, which is odd, (1^2 -1)/4 = 0, which is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: numbers 1,2,3. The possible intervals are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]. The good pairs are those where the number of blue odd numbers is even. So, if we color 1 and 3 red, then all intervals will have 0 blue odds, which is even. So, all 6 intervals are good. But according to the formula, n=2 is even, so (2^2)/4 = 1, which is wrong.\n\nWait, so my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't just about the number of intervals with even sum in the prefix, but also considering the entire interval in the original sequence, which includes even numbers. So, the mapping isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of good pairs is equal to the total number of intervals minus the number of intervals with odd number of blue odd numbers. But that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another approach: for each interval [i, j], the number of blue odd numbers is even. So, the total number of good pairs is equal to the number of intervals where the number of blue odd numbers is even.\n\nBut how can we maximize this? Since Jadzia can choose the color of each number, she can influence the number of blue odd numbers in each interval.\n\nBut the problem is that the color of each number affects multiple intervals. For example, coloring a particular odd number blue affects all intervals that include it.\n\nSo, it's a problem of choosing colors for each odd number such that the number of intervals with an even number of blue odd numbers is maximized.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem in combinatorics where we want to maximize the number of even-weight intervals.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a binary vector where each bit corresponds to an odd number, and we want the number of intervals with even weight (number of 1s) to be as large as possible.\n\nIn coding theory, the number of even-weight intervals can be maximized by choosing the bits such that the number of 1s is balanced.\n\nWait, but in our case, the bits correspond to the odd numbers, and the intervals are determined by their positions in the original sequence, which includes both odd and even numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the number of intervals with even number of blue odd numbers is equal to the number of intervals where the number of blue odd numbers is even, regardless of the even numbers in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to choosing the colors of the odd", "answer": "\\(n^2\\)\n\nJeżeli Jadzia pomaluje każdą liczbę na niebiesko, to para \\((i, j)\\) jest dobra wtedy i tylko wtedy, gdy \\(j - i\\) jest liczbą parzystą.

Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It's not about each digit appearing exactly once, but rather that each digit appears the same number of times. So, for example, if \\( 2^k \\) has 10 digits, each digit should appear once. But if it has 20 digits, each should appear twice, and so on. So, the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10, right? Because each digit from 0 to 9 has to appear equally.\n\nWait, but 0 is a tricky digit because it can't be the leading digit. So, in the number \\( 2^k \\), the first digit can't be 0, but the other digits can be. So, the count for 0 will be one less than the others if the number has more than one digit. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nLet me think about the number of digits in \\( 2^k \\). The number of digits \\( d \\) in a number \\( n \\) is given by \\( d = \\lfloor \\log_{10} n \\rfloor + 1 \\). So, for \\( 2^k \\), the number of digits is \\( \\lfloor k \\log_{10} 2 \\rfloor + 1 \\). Since \\( \\log_{10} 2 \\) is approximately 0.3010, the number of digits grows roughly by 0.3010 each time \\( k \\) increases by 1.\n\nNow, for each digit from 0 to 9 to appear the same number of times, the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10. Let's denote the number of digits as \\( D = 10m \\), where \\( m \\) is a positive integer. So, \\( D = 10m \\), meaning \\( 2^k \\) must have exactly \\( 10m \\) digits.\n\nBut wait, the first digit can't be 0, so the count for 0 will be \\( m - 1 \\) if the number has \\( 10m \\) digits. Because the first digit is non-zero, and the remaining \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits can include 0. So, for 0 to appear \\( m \\) times, the total number of digits must be \\( 10m + 1 \\). Hmm, that might not be possible because \\( 10m + 1 \\) isn't a multiple of 10. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of digits is \\( 10m \\), and 0 appears \\( m \\) times, but since the first digit is non-zero, the remaining \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits must include 0 exactly \\( m \\) times. That would mean that the remaining digits (excluding the first one) have \\( m \\) zeros and \\( 9m \\) other digits. But each of the other digits (1-9) must also appear exactly \\( m \\) times. So, in total, each digit from 1 to 9 appears \\( m \\) times, and 0 appears \\( m \\) times as well, but one of those zeros is in the non-leading position.\n\nWait, that might not add up. Let me think again. If the total number of digits is \\( 10m \\), and the first digit is non-zero, then the remaining \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits must contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly \\( m \\) times. But that's impossible because 0 can only appear \\( m \\) times in \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits, but the other digits (1-9) would have to appear \\( m \\) times each in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits, which is not possible because \\( 10m - 1 \\) isn't divisible by 9. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that for each digit to appear the same number of times, the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10. So, \\( D = 10m \\). Then, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly \\( m \\) times. But since the first digit is non-zero, 0 can only appear in the remaining \\( D - 1 = 10m - 1 \\) digits. So, 0 appears \\( m \\) times in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits, which is possible only if \\( 10m - 1 \\geq m \\), which is true for \\( m \\geq 1 \\). But then, the other digits (1-9) must also appear \\( m \\) times in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits. So, the total number of non-zero digits is \\( 9m \\), and the number of non-leading digits is \\( 10m - 1 \\). So, \\( 9m = 10m - 1 \\), which implies \\( m = 1 \\). So, the only possible case is when \\( m = 1 \\), meaning \\( D = 10 \\) digits.\n\nSo, the number \\( 2^k \\) must have exactly 10 digits, and each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. That means \\( 2^k \\) is a 10-digit number where each digit is unique. Let me check what \\( 2^k \\) is for various \\( k \\) to see if any of them are pandigital (containing all digits from 0 to 9 exactly once).\n\nI know that \\( 2^{33} = 8,589,934,592 \\). Let me count the digits: 8,5,8,9,9,3,4,5,9,2. Wait, that's 10 digits, but digits repeat: 8 appears twice, 9 appears three times, etc. So, not pandigital.\n\nWhat about \\( 2^{49} = 562,949,953,421,312 \\). That's 15 digits, so too long.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a 10-digit number. Let me see, \\( 2^{33} \\) is 8,589,934,592, which is 10 digits but with repeating digits. \\( 2^{34} = 17,179,869,184 \\), which is 11 digits. Hmm, so between \\( 2^{33} \\) and \\( 2^{34} \\), the number of digits increases from 10 to 11. So, there's no 10-digit power of 2 beyond \\( 2^{33} \\). Wait, actually, \\( 2^{33} \\) is 8,589,934,592, which is 10 digits. \\( 2^{34} \\) is 17,179,869,184, which is 11 digits. So, the only 10-digit power of 2 is \\( 2^{33} \\), but it's not pandigital.\n\nSo, if \\( m = 1 \\) is the only possibility, and \\( 2^{33} \\) isn't pandigital, then maybe there's no such \\( k \\). But wait, maybe \\( m \\) can be larger? Let me think again.\n\nIf \\( D = 10m \\), then each digit appears \\( m \\) times. But the first digit is non-zero, so 0 can only appear in the remaining \\( D - 1 = 10m - 1 \\) digits. So, 0 appears \\( m \\) times in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits, which is possible only if \\( 10m - 1 \\geq m \\), which is true for \\( m \\geq 1 \\). But then, the other digits (1-9) must also appear \\( m \\) times in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) digits. So, the total number of non-zero digits is \\( 9m \\), and the number of non-leading digits is \\( 10m - 1 \\). So, \\( 9m = 10m - 1 \\), which gives \\( m = 1 \\). So, only \\( m = 1 \\) is possible, meaning \\( D = 10 \\). Therefore, the only possible case is 10 digits, each digit appearing once, but as we saw, \\( 2^{33} \\) isn't pandigital.\n\nWait, but maybe \\( m \\) can be larger if we consider that 0 can appear in the leading position? No, because the leading digit can't be 0. So, 0 can only appear in the other positions. So, for \\( D = 10m \\), 0 appears \\( m \\) times in \\( D - 1 = 10m - 1 \\) positions, which requires \\( m \\leq 10m - 1 \\), which is always true for \\( m \\geq 1 \\). But the other digits (1-9) must also appear \\( m \\) times in those \\( 10m - 1 \\) positions. So, the total number of non-zero digits is \\( 9m \\), and the number of non-leading digits is \\( 10m - 1 \\). So, \\( 9m = 10m - 1 \\) implies \\( m = 1 \\). So, only \\( m = 1 \\) is possible, meaning \\( D = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is \\( D = 10 \\), and \\( 2^k \\) must be a 10-digit pandigital number. But as we saw, \\( 2^{33} \\) is 8,589,934,592, which isn't pandigital. The next power is \\( 2^{34} \\), which is 17,179,869,184, which is 11 digits. So, there's no 10-digit power of 2 beyond \\( 2^{33} \\). Therefore, there's no \\( k \\) such that \\( 2^k \\) is a 10-digit pandigital number.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Maybe \\( m \\) can be larger if we consider that 0 can appear more than once in the non-leading positions. But according to the earlier reasoning, \\( m = 1 \\) is the only possibility because \\( 9m = 10m - 1 \\) only when \\( m = 1 \\). So, even if \\( m \\) is larger, the equation doesn't hold. Therefore, it's impossible for \\( 2^k \\) to have each digit from 0 to 9 appearing the same number of times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of digits isn't a multiple of 10. But then, how can each digit appear the same number of times? If the total number of digits isn't a multiple of 10, you can't have an equal count for each digit. So, the number of digits must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the only possible case is \\( D = 10m \\), which leads to \\( m = 1 \\), and no such \\( k \\) exists.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe that there is no positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 2^k \\) has each digit from 0 to 9 appearing the same number of times.\n</think>\n\nThere is no positive integer \\( k \\) for which \\( 2^k \\) contains each digit from 0 to 9 the same number of times. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{Nie istnieje takie dodatnie całkowite \\( k \\)}}", "answer": "Taka liczba **nie** istnieje.  \nZałóżmy, że taka liczba całkowita \\( k \\) istnieje i niech \\( \\ell \\) będzie liczbą wystąpień każdej z cyfr \\( 0, 1, \\ldots, 9 \\) w zapisie dziesiętnym liczby \\( 2^k \\).

Also, it's given that \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\). Hmm, that seems like a cyclic system of equations. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px + q = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -p \\) and the product is \\( q \\). So, applying that here, for each \\( i \\), the sum of \\( a_{i+1} \\) and \\( b_{i+1} \\) should be equal to \\( -a_i \\), and their product should be equal to \\( b_i \\).

For \\( i = 2 \\):\n   - \\( a_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n\n3. For \\( i = 3 \\):\n   - \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\)\n   - \\( a_1 \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\)\n\nAnd since it's cyclic, \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\), so the pattern continues.\n\nSo, now I have a system of six equations with six variables: \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 \\). Let me see if I can express each variable in terms of the previous ones and then substitute them to find a relationship.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n1. \\( a_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\) => \\( a_2 = -a_1 - b_2 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( a_2 \\) from the first equation into the second:\n\n\\( (-a_1 - b_2) \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n=> \\( -a_1 b_2 - b_2^2 = b_1 \\)\n=> \\( b_1 = -a_1 b_2 - b_2^2 \\)  [Equation A]\n\nMoving to the second set of equations:\n\n3. \\( a_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\)\nBut from equation 1, \\( a_2 = -a_1 - b_2 \\), so:\n\\( a_3 + b_3 = a_1 + b_2 \\)\n=> \\( a_3 = a_1 + b_2 - b_3 \\)  [Equation B]\n\n4. \\( a_3 \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\nSubstituting \\( a_3 \\) from Equation B:\n\\( (a_1 + b_2 - b_3) \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n=> \\( a_1 b_3 + b_2 b_3 - b_3^2 = b_2 \\)\n=> \\( a_1 b_3 + b_2 b_3 - b_3^2 - b_2 = 0 \\)\n=> \\( a_1 b_3 + b_2 (b_3 - 1) - b_3^2 = 0 \\)  [Equation C]\n\nNow, moving to the third set of equations:\n\n5. \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\)\nFrom Equation B, \\( a_3 = a_1 + b_2 - b_3 \\), so:\n\\( a_1 + b_1 = - (a_1 + b_2 - b_3) \\)\n=> \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_1 - b_2 + b_3 \\)\n=> \\( 2a_1 + b_1 + b_2 - b_3 = 0 \\)  [Equation D]\n\n6. \\( a_1 \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\)\nSo, \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\)  [Equation E]\n\nNow, let's substitute Equation E into Equation D:\n\n\\( 2a_1 + b_1 + b_2 - (a_1 b_1) = 0 \\)\n=> \\( 2a_1 + b_1 + b_2 - a_1 b_1 = 0 \\)  [Equation F]\n\nNow, let's see if we can express \\( b_2 \\) in terms of other variables.

Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\), since \\( a_1 \\) is the starting point.\n\nFrom Equation E: \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\)\n\nFrom Equation C: \\( a_1 b_3 + b_2 (b_3 - 1) - b_3^2 = 0 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\):\n\n\\( a_1 (a_1 b_1) + b_2 (a_1 b_1 - 1) - (a_1 b_1)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 + a_1 b_1 b_2 - b_2 - a_1^2 b_1^2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 - a_1^2 b_1^2 + a_1 b_1 b_2 - b_2 = 0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\n- \\( a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) \\)\n- \\( b_2 (a_1 b_1 - 1) \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) + b_2 (a_1 b_1 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, interesting.

The condition is that the sum of each row and each column should also be a square number, and all these \\( 2n \\) sums should be different from each other. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I have an \\( n \\times n \\) grid, and I need to fill each cell with a distinct square number. So, each cell has a number like \\( a^2 \\), \\( b^2 \\), \\( c^2 \\), etc., and all these squares are different. Then, when I add up the numbers in each row, each of those sums should also be a square number, and similarly, each column sum should be a square number. Moreover, all these row sums and column sums must be distinct from each other. So, in total, there are \\( 2n \\) different square numbers as sums.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out for which \\( n \\) this is possible. Let me start with small values of \\( n \\) and see if I can find a pattern or maybe even a general rule.\n\nLet's start with \\( n = 1 \\). That's the simplest case. The grid is just a single cell. I need to write a square number in it, say \\( k^2 \\). The sum of the row is \\( k^2 \\), and the sum of the column is also \\( k^2 \\). But wait, the problem says that all \\( 2n \\) sums should be different. For \\( n = 1 \\), that would mean the row sum and the column sum are the same, which violates the condition. So, \\( n = 1 \\) is not possible. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I misread the problem. It says \"parami różne kwadraty liczb całkowitych\" which translates to \"pairwise different squares of integers.\" So, does that mean the numbers in the grid have to be pairwise different squares, or the sums have to be pairwise different squares? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nIt says: \"wyznaczyć wszystkie liczby całkowite \\( n \\geq 1 \\), dla których w pola kwadratowej tablicy o wymiarach \\( n \\times n \\) można tak wpisać parami różne kwadraty liczb całkowitych, by suma liczb w każdym wierszu i w każdej kolumnie tablicy była kwadratem liczby całkowitej oraz te \\( 2n \\) sum było parami różnych.\"\n\nSo, it's the numbers in the grid that have to be pairwise different squares, and the row and column sums also have to be pairwise different squares. So, the numbers in the grid are distinct squares, and the sums of rows and columns are also distinct squares. So, for \\( n = 1 \\), the grid has one cell, which is a square, and the row sum and column sum are both equal to that square. But since we need \\( 2n = 2 \\) different sums, which would require the row sum and column sum to be different, but they are the same. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is impossible.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 2 \\). Let's see if it's possible. So, we have a 2x2 grid. We need to fill it with four distinct square numbers. Let's denote them as \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2 \\). Then, the row sums and column sums should also be distinct squares.\n\nLet me try to construct such a grid. Let's pick small squares: 1, 4, 9, 16. Maybe arranging them in a way that the row sums and column sums are also squares.\n\nLet me try:\n\nFirst row: 1 and 16. Sum is 17, which is not a square.\n\nFirst row: 1 and 9. Sum is 10, not a square.\n\nFirst row: 4 and 9. Sum is 13, not a square.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to pick larger squares. Let's try 1, 4, 9, 16.\n\nWait, maybe arrange them as:\n\nFirst row: 1 and 16. Sum is 17.\n\nSecond row: 4 and 9. Sum is 13.\n\nBut 17 and 13 are not squares. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nFirst row: 1 and 25. Sum is 26.\n\nSecond row: 4 and 16. Sum is 20.\n\nStill not squares.\n\nWait, maybe I need to pick squares such that their sums are also squares. Let's think about possible square sums.\n\nFor example, 1 + 36 = 37, not a square.\n\n1 + 49 = 50, not a square.\n\nWait, 25 + 25 = 50, but they have to be distinct.\n\nWait, 16 + 9 = 25, which is a square. So, if I have two rows where each row sums to 25, but then the column sums would be 16 + 9 = 25 and 9 + 16 = 25, which are the same. So, that's not allowed because the column sums have to be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have row sums as 25 and 36, and column sums as 16 and 49.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nFirst row: 9 and 16. Sum is 25.\n\nSecond row: 16 and 20²? Wait, 20² is 400, which is too big. Maybe 25 and 11²=121. Wait, 25 + 121 = 146, which is not a square.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying random numbers, I can think about the properties required.\n\nEach row sum and column sum must be a square. Also, all these sums must be distinct.\n\nSo, for \\( n = 2 \\), we have four distinct squares in the grid, and four sums (two rows, two columns), each of which is a distinct square.\n\nSo, in total, we have eight distinct squares: four in the grid and four as sums.\n\nWait, but the numbers in the grid are four distinct squares, and the sums are four distinct squares, so altogether, we have eight distinct squares. So, the numbers in the grid and the sums must all be different squares.\n\nSo, for \\( n = 2 \\), we need eight distinct squares: four in the grid and four as sums.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me try to find such numbers.\n\nLet me list some small squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.\n\nI need four numbers in the grid, say \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2 \\), and four sums \\( s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2 \\), all distinct.\n\nMoreover, the sum of the first row is \\( a^2 + b^2 = s_1 \\), the sum of the second row is \\( c^2 + d^2 = s_2 \\), the sum of the first column is \\( a^2 + c^2 = t_1 \\), and the sum of the second column is \\( b^2 + d^2 = t_2 \\). All \\( s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2 \\) must be distinct squares, and all \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2, s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2 \\) must be distinct.\n\nSo, let's try to find such numbers.\n\nLet me try small squares.\n\nSuppose \\( a^2 = 1 \\), \\( b^2 = 81 \\), \\( c^2 = 16 \\), \\( d^2 = 36 \\).\n\nThen, row sums: 1 + 81 = 82 (not a square), 16 + 36 = 52 (not a square). So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, \\( a^2 = 1 \\), \\( b^2 = 25 \\), \\( c^2 = 16 \\), \\( d^2 = 36 \\).\n\nRow sums: 1 + 25 = 26 (not square), 16 + 36 = 52 (not square). Nope.\n\nWait, maybe try \\( a^2 = 9 \\), \\( b^2 = 16 \\), \\( c^2 = 25 \\), \\( d^2 = 36 \\).\n\nRow sums: 9 + 16 = 25 (square), 25 + 36 = 61 (not square). So, one sum is good, the other isn't.\n\nAlternatively, \\( a^2 = 9 \\), \\( b^2 = 16 \\), \\( c^2 = 25 \\), \\( d^2 = 49 \\).\n\nRow sums: 9 + 16 = 25, 25 + 49 = 74 (not square). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \\( a^2 = 16 \\), \\( b^2 = 9 \\), \\( c^2 = 25 \\), \\( d^2 = 36 \\).\n\nRow sums: 16 + 9 = 25, 25 + 36 = 61. Again, one is square, the other isn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( a^2 = 25 \\), \\( b^2 = 144 \\), \\( c^2 = 16 \\), \\( d^2 = 169 \\).\n\nRow sums: 25 + 144 = 169, which is a square. 16 + 169 = 185, not a square.\n\nHmm, so one row sum is square, the other isn't.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have both row sums as squares. So, both \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) and \\( c^2 + d^2 \\) must be squares.\n\nSimilarly, column sums \\( a^2 + c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 + d^2 \\) must be squares.\n\nSo, I need four numbers \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2 \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( a^2 + b^2 = s_1 \\) (square)\n2. \\( c^2 + d^2 = s_2 \\) (square)\n3. \\( a^2 + c^2 = t_1 \\) (square)\n4. \\( b^2 + d^2 = t_2 \\) (square)\n5. All \\( s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2 \\) are distinct\n6. All \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2, s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2 \\) are distinct\n\nThis seems quite restrictive. Maybe I can look for such numbers.\n\nI recall that numbers which can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more than one way are called \"taxicab numbers.\" The smallest taxicab number is 50, which is \\( 1^2 + 7^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 \\). But in our case, we need four distinct squares adding up in two different pairs to give two different squares.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 50 as a sum for both rows, but then the column sums would have to be different. Let me try.\n\nSuppose \\( a^2 + b^2 = 50 \\) and \\( c^2 + d^2 = 50 \\). Then, the column sums would be \\( a^2 + c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 + d^2 \\). If \\( a^2 + c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 + d^2 \\) are also squares, and all eight numbers are distinct, that might work.\n\nLet me pick \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 7 \\), \\( c = 5 \\), \\( d = 5 \\). But wait, \\( d = 5 \\) is same as \\( c = 5 \\), so the numbers in the grid would not be distinct. That's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 7 \\), \\( c = 5 \\), \\( d = 5 \\). Again, duplicates. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 7 \\), \\( c = 7 \\), \\( d = 1 \\). But then, numbers in the grid would be 1, 49, 49, 1, which are duplicates. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use different pairs for the sums.\n\nWait, 50 can be expressed as 1 + 49, 25 + 25, but those are duplicates. Maybe 50 is not the right number.\n\nWhat about 65? 65 can be expressed as 1 + 64, 16 + 49.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\nFirst row: 1 and 64. Sum is 65.\n\nSecond row: 16 and 49. Sum is 65.\n\nNow, column sums:\n\nFirst column: 1 + 16 = 17 (not a square)\n\nSecond column: 64 + 49 = 113 (not a square)\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange the numbers differently.\n\nFirst row: 1 and 64. Sum is 65.\n\nSecond row: 16 and 49. Sum is 65.\n\nBut column sums are 17 and 113, which are not squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use different sums.\n\nWait, 325 is a taxicab number: 1^2 + 18^2 = 6^2 + 17^2 = 10^2 + 15^2.\n\nBut that's three representations. Maybe I can use that.\n\nLet me try:\n\nFirst row: 1 and 18²=324. Sum is 325.\n\nSecond row: 6²=36 and 17²=289. Sum is 325.\n\nNow, column sums:\n\nFirst column: 1 + 36 = 37 (not a square)\n\nSecond column: 324 + 289 = 61", "answer": "Wszystkie \\(n > 2\\).  \nOczywiście dla \\(n = 1\\) sumy w jednym wierszu i w jednej kolumnie są takie same.

Then, \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = mn = 4 \\). So, the pairs (m, n) can be (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). Therefore:\n\n1. If \\( m = 1 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), then \\( a = 2 - 1 = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 - 4 = -2 \\). But \\( b = -2 \\) is not possible because \\( b = \\sqrt{y} \\geq 0 \\). So, discard this.\n2. If \\( m = 2 \\), \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( a = 2 - 2 = 0 \\), \\( b = 2 - 2 = 0 \\). So, \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\).\n3. If \\( m = 4 \\), \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( a = 2 - 4 = -2 \\), \\( b = 2 - 1 = 1 \\). Again, \\( a = -2 \\) is invalid because \\( a = \\sqrt{x} \\geq 0 \\). So, discard this.\n\nSo, the only valid solution in this case is \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nWait, but let's check if \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) satisfy the original equation.\n\nLeft side: \\( \\sqrt{0 \\times 0} = 0 \\).\n\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{0} = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\).\n\nYes, it works.\n\nSo, from both cases, the possible solutions are:\n\n1. \\( x = 9 \\), \\( y = 36 \\)\n2. \\( x = 16 \\), \\( y = 16 \\)\n3. \\( x = 36 \\), \\( y = 9 \\)\n4. \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\)\n\nWait, but let me check if \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) are the only solutions in the second case. Because when \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), that's the only possibility when both \\( a - 2 \\) and \\( b - 2 \\) are negative. So, yes, only \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\) is a solution there.\n\nNow, let me check if there are any other possibilities. For example, if \\( a - 2 \\) is zero, then \\( a = 2 \\), and \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 0 \\times (b - 2) = 0 \\), but we need the product to be 4, so that's not possible. Similarly, if \\( a - 2 \\) is zero, it can't contribute to the product being 4. So, the only solutions are the ones we found.\n\nWait, but let me also check if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be non-integers. Because \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are non-negative integers, but \\( a = \\sqrt{x} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{y} \\) don't have to be integers. For example, \\( x = 2 \\) would give \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\), which is irrational. But in our equation \\( ab = 2a + 2b \\), if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are irrational, would that lead to integer \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)?\n\nWait, but if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are irrational, then \\( x = a^2 \\) and \\( y = b^2 \\) would still be integers only if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are square roots of integers. But in our earlier substitution, we let \\( a = \\sqrt{x} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{y} \\), so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are square roots of integers, but not necessarily integers themselves. However, in our equation \\( ab = 2a + 2b \\), if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are irrational, would that lead to integer solutions?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are such that \\( ab = 2a + 2b \\). Let me rearrange this as \\( ab - 2a - 2b = 0 \\), which we did earlier, and then factored as \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\). So, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not integers, but \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be square roots of integers, but perhaps non-integers. However, in our earlier approach, we considered \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as integers, but maybe we can have other solutions where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not integers.\n\nWait, but if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not integers, then \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\) would require that \\( a - 2 \\) and \\( b - 2 \\) are such that their product is 4, but \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are square roots of integers. So, perhaps there are more solutions where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not integers, but \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers.\n\nWait, but let me test this. Suppose \\( a = \\sqrt{x} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{y} \\), and \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\). So, \\( a - 2 = \\frac{4}{b - 2} \\). So, \\( a = 2 + \\frac{4}{b - 2} \\). Since \\( a = \\sqrt{x} \\) must be a real number, \\( b - 2 \\) cannot be zero, so \\( b \\neq 2 \\). Similarly, \\( a - 2 \\) cannot be zero, so \\( a \\neq 2 \\).\n\nBut \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are non-negative integers, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be square roots of non-negative integers. So, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be integers or irrationals, but in this case, since \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\), perhaps \\( a - 2 \\) and \\( b - 2 \\) are rational numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as real numbers such that \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\), and \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) are integers. So, perhaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are such that \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) are integers, but \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) themselves are not necessarily integers.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers because if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are perfect squares, then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers. But perhaps there are solutions where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are not perfect squares, but \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are such that \\( (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4 \\) and \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) are integers.\n\nWait, but if \\( a \\) is irrational, then \\( a^2 \\) could still be an integer. For example, \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\), then \\( a^2 = 2 \\). So, maybe \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be irrational but their squares are integers. So, perhaps there are more solutions beyond the ones we found where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\nWait, but let me check if such solutions exist. Let's suppose \\( a \\) is irrational, but \\( a^2 \\) is an integer. So, \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\) where \\( n \\) is a non-square integer. Similarly for \\( b \\).\n\nSo, let's suppose \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{m} \\), where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are non-square integers. Then, our equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{m} = 2\\sqrt{n} + 2\\sqrt{m}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{nm} = 2\\sqrt{n} + 2\\sqrt{m}\n\\]\n\nHmm, this seems more complicated. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\nnm = (2\\sqrt{n} + 2\\sqrt{m})^2\n\\]\n\\[\nnm = 4n + 8\\sqrt{nm} + 4m\n\\]\n\nHmm, that introduces a square root term again. Let me rearrange:\n\n\\[\nnm - 4n - 4m = 8\\sqrt{nm}\n\\]\n\nNow, square both sides again:\n\n\\[\n(nm - 4n - 4m)^2 = 64nm\n\\]\n\nThis seems messy, but maybe I can find some solutions this way. Let me try small non-square integers for \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) and see if this equation holds.\n\nLet me try", "answer": "Jedynymi parami nieujemnych liczb całkowitych \\( x, y \\) spełniającymi dane równanie są: \\( (0, 0), (9, 16) \\) i \\( (16, 9) \\)."}

All are real numbers. I need to find all triples (x, y, z) that satisfy all three equations simultaneously.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can find any symmetry or patterns in the equations. Each equation has a similar structure: a squared variable multiplied by another variable, plus 2 equals the variable itself plus twice the product of the other two variables. So, each equation is cyclic in x, y, z.\n\nMaybe I can assume that x = y = z? Let me test that.\n\nLet’s suppose x = y = z = k, where k is a real number. Then substituting into the first equation:\n\nk² * k + 2 = k + 2 * k * k\n\nSimplify:\n\nk³ + 2 = k + 2k²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nk³ - 2k² - k + 2 = 0\n\nSo, we have a cubic equation: k³ - 2k² - k + 2 = 0\n\nLet me try to factor this. Maybe rational roots? The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2.\n\nTesting k=1: 1 - 2 -1 + 2 = 0. Yes, k=1 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (k - 1):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide k³ - 2k² - k + 2 by (k - 1):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -2 | -1 | 2\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -2 + 1 = -1\n\nMultiply by 1: -1\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -1 + (-1) = -2\n\nMultiply by 1: -2\n\nAdd to last coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (k - 1)(k² - k - 2) = 0\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: k² - k - 2\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1. That would be -2 and 1.\n\nSo, (k - 2)(k + 1) = 0\n\nThus, the roots are k = 1, k = 2, k = -1.\n\nSo, if x = y = z = k, then possible solutions are (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (-1,-1,-1).\n\nLet me check each of these in the original equations.\n\nFirst, (1,1,1):\n\nFirst equation: 1²*1 + 2 = 1 + 2*1*1 => 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 => 3=3 ✔️\n\nSecond equation: same as first, so ✔️\n\nThird equation: same, ✔️\n\nSo, (1,1,1) is a solution.\n\nNext, (2,2,2):\n\nFirst equation: 2²*2 + 2 = 2 + 2*2*2 => 8 + 2 = 2 + 8 => 10=10 ✔️\n\nSecond equation: same, ✔️\n\nThird equation: same, ✔️\n\nSo, (2,2,2) is a solution.\n\nNext, (-1,-1,-1):\n\nFirst equation: (-1)²*(-1) + 2 = (-1) + 2*(-1)*(-1) => 1*(-1) + 2 = -1 + 2*1 => -1 + 2 = -1 + 2 => 1=1 ✔️\n\nSecond equation: same, ✔️\n\nThird equation: same, ✔️\n\nSo, (-1,-1,-1) is a solution.\n\nOkay, so we have three solutions where x=y=z. But are there more solutions where x, y, z are not all equal?\n\nI need to check if there are other solutions.\n\nLet me consider the case where one of the variables is zero. Suppose x=0.\n\nIf x=0, let's substitute into the first equation:\n\n0²*y + 2 = 0 + 2*y*z => 0 + 2 = 0 + 2yz => 2 = 2yz => yz = 1\n\nSecond equation: y²*z + 2 = y + 2*z*0 => y² z + 2 = y\n\nThird equation: z²*0 + 2 = z + 2*0*y => 0 + 2 = z => z=2\n\nSo, from third equation, z=2.\n\nFrom yz=1, since z=2, y=1/2.\n\nNow, substitute y=1/2 and z=2 into the second equation:\n\n( (1/2)² )*2 + 2 = (1/2) + 0\n\nCompute left side: (1/4)*2 + 2 = 1/2 + 2 = 5/2\n\nRight side: 1/2\n\nSo, 5/2 ≠ 1/2. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, x=0 leads to a contradiction, so x cannot be zero. Similarly, if I assume y=0 or z=0, I can check.\n\nSuppose y=0.\n\nFirst equation: x²*0 + 2 = x + 2*0*z => 0 + 2 = x + 0 => x=2\n\nSecond equation: 0²*z + 2 = 0 + 2*z*x => 0 + 2 = 0 + 2*z*2 => 2 = 4z => z=0.5\n\nThird equation: z²*x + 2 = z + 2*x*0 => (0.5)²*2 + 2 = 0.5 + 0 => (0.25)*2 + 2 = 0.5 => 0.5 + 2 = 0.5 => 2.5 = 0.5. Contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, if z=0:\n\nFirst equation: x² y + 2 = x + 0 => x² y + 2 = x\n\nSecond equation: y²*0 + 2 = y + 0 => 0 + 2 = y => y=2\n\nThird equation: 0² x + 2 = 0 + 2xy => 0 + 2 = 2xy => 2 = 2x*2 => 2 = 4x => x=0.5\n\nSubstitute x=0.5 and y=2 into first equation:\n\n(0.5)² * 2 + 2 = 0.5 + 0 => 0.25*2 + 2 = 0.5 => 0.5 + 2 = 0.5 => 2.5 = 0.5. Contradiction.\n\nSo, none of the variables can be zero. So, x, y, z ≠ 0.\n\nTherefore, all variables are non-zero. Maybe I can manipulate the equations to find relations between variables.\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\n1) x² y - x = 2 z y - 2\n\n2) y² z - y = 2 x z - 2\n\n3) z² x - z = 2 x y - 2\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor some terms.\n\nLooking at equation 1:\n\nx² y - x = 2 z y - 2\n\nFactor x on the left: x(x y - 1) = 2 z y - 2\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\ny² z - y = 2 x z - 2\n\nFactor y: y(y z - 1) = 2 x z - 2\n\nEquation 3:\n\nz² x - z = 2 x y - 2\n\nFactor z: z(z x - 1) = 2 x y - 2\n\nHmm, interesting. So, each equation is of the form variable*(variable*next -1) = 2*next*previous - 2.\n\nWait, maybe I can express each equation as:\n\nFrom equation 1: x(x y - 1) = 2 z y - 2\n\nFrom equation 2: y(y z - 1) = 2 x z - 2\n\nFrom equation 3: z(z x - 1) = 2 x y - 2\n\nLet me denote A = x y, B = y z, C = z x.\n\nThen, equation 1: x(A - 1) = 2 B - 2\n\nEquation 2: y(B - 1) = 2 C - 2\n\nEquation 3: z(C - 1) = 2 A - 2\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express each equation as:\n\nFrom equation 1: x² y - x = 2 z y - 2\n\nBring all terms to left: x² y - x - 2 z y + 2 = 0\n\nFactor terms with y: y(x² - 2 z) - x + 2 = 0\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: y² z - y - 2 x z + 2 = 0 => z(y² - 2x) - y + 2 = 0\n\nEquation 3: z² x - z - 2 x y + 2 = 0 => x(z² - 2 y) - z + 2 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can subtract equations or find ratios.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider subtracting equations.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(x² y + 2) - (y² z + 2) = (x + 2 z y) - (y + 2 z x)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² y - y² z = x - y + 2 z y - 2 z x\n\nFactor left side: y(x² - y z) = x - y + 2 z(y - x)\n\nHmm, maybe factor (x - y):\n\nLeft side: y(x² - y z)\n\nRight side: (x - y) + 2 z(y - x) = (x - y) - 2 z(x - y) = (x - y)(1 - 2 z)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny(x² - y z) = (x - y)(1 - 2 z)\n\nSimilarly, maybe factor (x - y):\n\nIf x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):\n\ny(x² - y z)/(x - y) = 1 - 2 z\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the ratios of the equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: x² y + 2 = x + 2 z y\n\nFrom equation 2: y² z + 2 = y + 2 x z\n\nFrom equation 3: z² x + 2 = z + 2 x y\n\nLet me subtract 2 from both sides in each equation:\n\nEquation 1: x² y - x = 2 z y - 2\n\nEquation 2: y² z - y = 2 x z - 2\n\nEquation 3: z² x - z = 2 x y - 2\n\nWait, so each equation is of the form:\n\nvariable² * next variable - variable = 2 * next variable * previous variable - 2\n\nSo, equation 1: x² y - x = 2 z y - 2\n\nEquation 2: y² z - y = 2 x z - 2\n\nEquation 3: z² x - z = 2 x y - 2\n\nHmm, maybe I can write each equation as:\n\nx² y - x - 2 z y + 2 = 0\n\nSimilarly, y² z - y - 2 x z + 2 = 0\n\nz² x - z - 2 x y + 2 = 0\n\nLet me factor each equation:\n\nEquation 1: x y (x - 2 z) - (x - 2) = 0\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nx² y - x - 2 z y + 2 = x y (x - 2 z) - (x - 2) = 0\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: y z (y - 2 x) - (y - 2) = 0\n\nEquation 3: z x (z - 2 y) - (z - 2) = 0\n\nHmm, interesting. So, each equation is of the form:\n\n(variable * next variable)(variable - 2 * previous variable) - (variable - 2) = 0\n\nSo, equation 1: (x y)(x - 2 z) - (x - 2) = 0\n\nEquation 2: (y z)(y - 2 x) - (y - 2) = 0\n\nEquation 3: (z x)(z - 2 y) - (z - 2) = 0\n\nHmm, maybe I can write each equation as:\n\n(variable * next variable)(variable - 2 previous) = (variable - 2)\n\nSo, equation 1: (x y)(x - 2 z) = x - 2\n\nEquation 2: (y z)(y - 2 x) = y - 2\n\nEquation 3: (z x)(z - 2 y) = z - 2\n\nHmm, perhaps I can denote u = x - 2, v = y - 2, w = z - 2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each equation as:\n\n(x y)(x - 2 z) = x - 2\n\nLet me divide both sides by (x - 2), assuming x ≠ 2.\n\nSo, (x y)(x - 2 z)/(x - 2) = 1\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case where x = y = z, which I already did, but maybe also consider cases where two variables are equal.\n\nSuppose x = y ≠ z.\n\nLet me set x = y = k, and z = m.\n\nThen, substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst equation: k² * k + 2 = k + 2 * m * k\n\nSimplify: k³ + 2 = k + 2 m k\n\nSecond equation: k² * m + 2 = k + 2 * k * m\n\nThird equation: m² * k + 2 = m + 2 * k * k\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1) k³ + 2 = k + 2 m k\n\n2) k² m + 2 = k + 2 m", "answer": "\bJedynymi trójkami x, y, z spełniającymi dane równania są: (-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)."}

I'll plug this into the equation and see what happens.\n\nSo, substituting \\( f(x) = kx + d \\) into the equation:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(kx + d + ky + d) + cxy = f(kx + ky + 2d) + cxy\n\\]\nSince \\( f \\) is linear, this becomes:\n\\[\nk(kx + ky + 2d) + d + cxy = k^2x + k^2y + 2kd + d + cxy\n\\]\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\\[\nf(x + y) = k(x + y) + d = kx + ky + d\n\\]\n\nSo, setting LHS equal to RHS:\n\\[\nk^2x + k^2y + 2kd + d + cxy = kx + ky + d\n\\]\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n- Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( k^2 = k \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( y \\): \\( k^2 = k \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( xy \\): \\( c = 0 \\)\n- Constant term: \\( 2kd + d = d \\)\n\nFrom the coefficient of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we have \\( k^2 = k \\), which implies \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nLet's consider each case:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( k = 0 \\)**\n   - Then, \\( f(x) = d \\) (a constant function).\n   - Plugging into the original equation:\n     \\[\n     f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + y)\n     \\]\n     Since \\( f \\) is constant, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(2d) = d \\).\n     So, LHS becomes \\( d + cxy \\).\n     RHS is \\( f(x + y) = d \\).\n     Therefore, \\( d + cxy = d \\) for all \\( x, y \\).\n     This implies \\( cxy = 0 \\) for all \\( x, y \\), which is only possible if \\( c = 0 \\).\n   - So, in this case, \\( c = 0 \\) is a possible solution.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( k = 1 \\)**\n   - Then, \\( f(x) = x + d \\).\n   - Plugging into the original equation:\n     \\[\n     f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + y)\n     \\]\n     Compute \\( f(x) + f(y) = (x + d) + (y + d) = x + y + 2d \\).\n     Then, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + y + 2d) = (x + y + 2d) + d = x + y + 3d \\).\n     So, LHS becomes \\( x + y + 3d + cxy \\).\n     RHS is \\( f(x + y) = (x + y) + d \\).\n     Therefore, equating LHS and RHS:\n     \\[\n     x + y + 3d + cxy = x + y + d\n     \\]\n     Simplify:\n     \\[\n     3d + cxy = d \\implies cxy = -2d\n     \\]\n     For this to hold for all \\( x, y \\), the coefficient of \\( xy \\) must be zero, so \\( c = 0 \\), and the constant term must also be zero, so \\( -2d = 0 \\implies d = 0 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f(x) = x \\) and \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, but in both cases, \\( c = 0 \\) is the only possibility? That seems a bit restrictive. Maybe I should check if there are other types of functions \\( f \\) that aren't linear which could satisfy the equation for different values of \\( c \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try plugging in specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to see if I can deduce more information about \\( c \\) or \\( f \\).\n\nLet me try setting \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\):\n\nPlugging into the original equation:\n\\[\nf(f(0) + f(0)) + c \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 = f(0 + 0)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf(2f(0)) = f(0)\n\\]\nLet me denote \\( a = f(0) \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(2a) = a\n\\]\nSo, \\( f(2a) = a \\). Hmm, not sure what to make of that yet.\n\nMaybe try setting \\( y = 0 \\) and keeping \\( x \\) arbitrary:\n\nPlugging into the original equation:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(0)) + c \\cdot x \\cdot 0 = f(x + 0)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + a) = f(x)\n\\]\nSo, for all \\( x \\), \\( f(f(x) + a) = f(x) \\). Interesting. Maybe this suggests that \\( f \\) is periodic or something? Or perhaps \\( f(x) + a = x \\) for all \\( x \\), but that would make \\( f(x) = x - a \\), which is linear. Wait, but earlier when I tried linear functions, only \\( c = 0 \\) worked. Maybe that's the only possibility.\n\nAlternatively, suppose \\( f \\) is injective or surjective. Maybe I can find out if \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is injective. Then, from \\( f(f(x) + a) = f(x) \\), injectivity would imply \\( f(x) + a = x \\) for all \\( x \\). So, \\( f(x) = x - a \\). Let me check if this works.\n\nLet \\( f(x) = x - a \\). Then, let's plug into the original equation:\n\nCompute \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy \\):\nFirst, \\( f(x) = x - a \\), so \\( f(x) + f(y) = (x - a) + (y - a) = x + y - 2a \\).\nThen, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + y - 2a) = (x + y - 2a) - a = x + y - 3a \\).\nSo, LHS is \\( x + y - 3a + cxy \\).\n\nRHS is \\( f(x + y) = (x + y) - a \\).\n\nSet them equal:\n\\[\nx + y - 3a + cxy = x + y - a\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-3a + cxy = -a \\implies cxy = 2a\n\\]\nAgain, for this to hold for all \\( x, y \\), \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( 2a = 0 \\implies a = 0 \\). So, \\( f(x) = x \\) and \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, even if I assume injectivity, I still get \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is not injective. Let's see.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is not injective. Then, there exist \\( u \\neq v \\) such that \\( f(u) = f(v) \\). But I'm not sure how that helps yet.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe set \\( y = x \\) and see what happens.\n\nSet \\( y = x \\):\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(x)) + c x^2 = f(2x)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf(2f(x)) + c x^2 = f(2x)\n\\]\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe if I can express \\( f(2x) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nAlternatively, let me consider if \\( f \\) is quadratic. Maybe \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + d \\). But that might complicate things, but let's try.\n\nAssume \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + d \\). Then, compute \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( f(x) + f(y) = a x^2 + b x + d + a y^2 + b y + d = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2d \\).\n\nThen, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = a [a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2d]^2 + b [a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2d] + d \\).\n\nThat seems really complicated. The equation would then involve a quartic term, which would have to match the RHS \\( f(x + y) = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + d \\). The LHS would have a quartic term \\( a [a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2d]^2 \\), which is degree 4, while the RHS is degree 2. For these to be equal for all \\( x, y \\), the coefficients of the higher degree terms must be zero. So, \\( a \\) must be zero, reducing \\( f \\) to a linear function. So, quadratic functions don't seem to work unless \\( a = 0 \\), which brings us back to the linear case.\n\nSo, maybe \\( f \\) is linear. Then, as before, only \\( c = 0 \\) works.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for all real numbers \\( c \\) for which such a function exists. So, maybe \\( c = 0 \\) is the only solution.\n\nBut let me check another case. Suppose \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Is it possible?\n\nSuppose \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Let me see if I can find a function \\( f \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet me try to see if \\( f \\) is additive or multiplicative. The equation has a term \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) \\) and a term \\( cxy \\). The additive functions usually satisfy \\( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \\), but here it's inside another function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is quadratic, but as I saw earlier, that leads to higher degree terms which can't be canceled unless \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is linear, but as we saw, only \\( c = 0 \\) works.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Maybe \\( f \\) is a quadratic function, but with some specific coefficients.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried quadratic, the LHS had a quartic term, which can't be canceled unless \\( a = 0 \\). So, unless \\( a = 0 \\), which reduces to linear, which only allows \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is a constant function. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = k \\) for all \\( x \\). Then, plug into the equation:\n\nLHS: \\( f(k + k) + cxy = f(2k) + cxy = k + cxy \\).\n\nRHS: \\( f(x + y) = k \\).\n\nSo, \\( k + cxy = k \\) for all \\( x, y \\). Therefore, \\( cxy = 0 \\) for all \\( x, y \\), which implies \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, constant functions only work when \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, so so far, all attempts to find a function \\( f \\) that works for \\( c \\neq 0 \\) lead to contradictions or only allow \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, maybe \\( f \\) is a linear function with \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Let me try again.\n\nEarlier, when I assumed \\( f(x) = kx + d \\), I found that \\( c = 0 \\) is necessary. But maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nLet me re-examine that.\n\nAssume \\( f(x) = kx + d \\).\n\nCompute LHS: \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy \\).\n\nFirst, \\( f(x) + f(y) = kx + d + ky + d = k(x + y) + 2d \\).\n\nThen, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = k(k(x + y) + 2d) + d = k^2(x + y) + 2kd + d \\).\n\nSo, LHS is \\( k^2(x + y) + 2kd + d + cxy \\).\n\nRHS: \\( f(x + y) = k(x + y) + d \\).\n\nSet LHS = RHS:\n\n\\( k^2(x + y) + 2kd + d + cxy = k(x + y) + d \\).\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\( (k^2 - k)(x + y) + (2kd + d - d) + cxy = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (k^2 - k)(x + y) + 2kd + cxy = 0 \\).\n\nThis must hold for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). Therefore, the coefficients of \\( x + y \\) and \\( xy \\) must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero.\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x + y \\): \\( k^2 - k = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( k(k - 1) = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = 1 \\).\n2. Coefficient of \\( xy \\): \\( c = 0 \\).\n3. Constant term: \\( 2kd = 0 \\).\n\nSo, from equation 2, \\( c = 0 \\). Then, from equation 3, \\( 2kd = 0 \\). If \\(", "answer": "**Rozwiązanie:**  \nUdowodnimy, że jedyną liczbą rzeczywistą \\( c \\), dla której istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach jest \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nPo pierwsze zauważmy, że jeżeli \\( c = 0 \\), to dowolna funkcja stała spełnia warunki zadania.  \nNiech \\( c > 0 \\) będzie taką liczbą rzeczywistą, że istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach.

Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these expressions looks like. Each one is a fraction where the numerator is the sum of two variables, and the denominator is a quadratic expression involving those two variables. The denominator looks familiar—it's similar to the expansion of (a + b)³, but not quite. Wait, actually, a² + ab + b² is a common term in factoring, especially when dealing with cubes. For example, a³ + b³ factors into (a + b)(a² - ab + b²). But here, the denominator is a² + ab + b², which is different. Maybe it's related to complex numbers, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nSo, the expressions are symmetric in a way. Each is a function of two variables, and we have three such expressions. The problem is asking if two of them can be equal while the third is different. So, maybe I can set two of these expressions equal and see if I can find a, b, c that satisfy that condition, with all three numbers being different and non-zero.\n\nLet me denote the expressions as follows:\n\nE1 = (a + b)/(a² + ab + b²)\n\nE2 = (b + c)/(b² + bc + c²)\n\nE3 = (c + a)/(c² + ca + a²)\n\nWe need to find a, b, c ≠ 0, a ≠ b ≠ c, such that two of E1, E2, E3 are equal, and the third is different.\n\nMaybe I can start by assuming E1 = E2 and see what that implies. So, set (a + b)/(a² + ab + b²) = (b + c)/(b² + bc + c²). Let's write that equation down:\n\n(a + b)/(a² + ab + b²) = (b + c)/(b² + bc + c²)\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n(a + b)(b² + bc + c²) = (b + c)(a² + ab + b²)\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a + b)(b² + bc + c²) = a*b² + a*bc + a*c² + b*b² + b*bc + b*c²\n\nSimplify: a b² + a b c + a c² + b³ + b² c + b c²\n\nRight side: (b + c)(a² + ab + b²) = b*a² + b*ab + b*b² + c*a² + c*ab + c*b²\n\nSimplify: b a² + a b² + b³ + c a² + a b c + c b²\n\nNow, let's write both sides:\n\nLeft: a b² + a b c + a c² + b³ + b² c + b c²\n\nRight: b a² + a b² + b³ + c a² + a b c + c b²\n\nNow, subtract right side from left side:\n\nLeft - Right = (a b² + a b c + a c² + b³ + b² c + b c²) - (b a² + a b² + b³ + c a² + a b c + c b²)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na b² - a b² = 0\n\na b c - a b c = 0\n\na c² - c a² = a c² - a² c = a c (c - a)\n\nb³ - b³ = 0\n\nb² c - c b² = 0\n\nb c² - c b² = b c² - b² c = b c (c - b)\n\nSo overall, Left - Right = a c (c - a) + b c (c - b)\n\nSo, setting Left - Right = 0:\n\na c (c - a) + b c (c - b) = 0\n\nFactor out c:\n\nc [a(c - a) + b(c - b)] = 0\n\nSince c ≠ 0 (given that all numbers are non-zero), we have:\n\na(c - a) + b(c - b) = 0\n\nExpand:\n\na c - a² + b c - b² = 0\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(a c + b c) - (a² + b²) = 0\n\nFactor c:\n\nc(a + b) - (a² + b²) = 0\n\nSo,\n\nc(a + b) = a² + b²\n\nTherefore,\n\nc = (a² + b²)/(a + b)\n\nHmm, interesting. So, if E1 = E2, then c must be equal to (a² + b²)/(a + b). Now, since a, b, c must be different, we need to ensure that c ≠ a and c ≠ b.\n\nLet me check if c can be equal to a or b.\n\nSuppose c = a. Then,\n\na = (a² + b²)/(a + b)\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b):\n\na(a + b) = a² + b²\n\nLeft side: a² + a b\n\nRight side: a² + b²\n\nSubtract a² from both sides:\n\na b = b²\n\nAssuming b ≠ 0, divide both sides by b:\n\na = b\n\nBut a and b are supposed to be different, so this is a contradiction. Similarly, if c = b, then:\n\nb = (a² + b²)/(a + b)\n\nMultiply both sides:\n\nb(a + b) = a² + b²\n\nLeft: a b + b²\n\nRight: a² + b²\n\nSubtract b²:\n\na b = a²\n\nAssuming a ≠ 0, divide by a:\n\nb = a\n\nAgain, a contradiction. So, c cannot be equal to a or b, so c is different from a and b, which is good.\n\nSo, now, we have c = (a² + b²)/(a + b). Now, we need to ensure that a, b, c are all different and non-zero.\n\nSo, let's proceed. Now, we have c expressed in terms of a and b. Now, we need to check whether E3 is equal to E1 or E2, or different.\n\nSo, let's compute E3:\n\nE3 = (c + a)/(c² + c a + a²)\n\nWe can substitute c = (a² + b²)/(a + b) into this expression.\n\nFirst, compute numerator: c + a = (a² + b²)/(a + b) + a = [a² + b² + a(a + b)]/(a + b) = [a² + b² + a² + a b]/(a + b) = [2 a² + a b + b²]/(a + b)\n\nDenominator: c² + c a + a²\n\nCompute c²: [(a² + b²)/(a + b)]² = (a^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4)/(a + b)^2\n\nCompute c a: a*(a² + b²)/(a + b) = (a^3 + a b²)/(a + b)\n\nSo, denominator:\n\nc² + c a + a² = (a^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4)/(a + b)^2 + (a^3 + a b²)/(a + b) + a²\n\nTo combine these, let's get a common denominator of (a + b)^2.\n\nFirst term is already over (a + b)^2.\n\nSecond term: (a^3 + a b²)/(a + b) = (a^3 + a b²)(a + b)/(a + b)^2\n\nThird term: a² = a² (a + b)^2/(a + b)^2\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n[ a^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4 + (a^3 + a b²)(a + b) + a² (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator of denominator:\n\nFirst term: a^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4\n\nSecond term: (a^3 + a b²)(a + b) = a^4 + a^3 b + a^3 b + a b^3 = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a b^3\n\nThird term: a² (a + b)^2 = a² (a² + 2 a b + b²) = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + 2 a^2 b² + a^2 b² = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + 3 a^2 b²\n\nWait, no, let me compute that again:\n\na² (a + b)^2 = a² (a² + 2 a b + b²) = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b²\n\nSo, adding all three terms:\n\nFirst: a^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4\n\nSecond: a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a b^3\n\nThird: a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b²\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\na^4 + 2 a² b² + b^4 + a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a b^3 + a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 a^4\n\na^3 b: 2 a^3 b + 2 a^3 b = 4 a^3 b\n\na^2 b²: 2 a² b² + a² b² = 3 a² b²\n\na b^3: 1 a b^3\n\nb^4: 1 b^4\n\nSo, denominator numerator: 3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4\n\nSo, denominator is [3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4]/(a + b)^2\n\nSo, E3 = [2 a² + a b + b²]/(a + b) divided by [3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4]/(a + b)^2\n\nWhich is equal to [2 a² + a b + b²]/(a + b) * (a + b)^2 / [3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4]\n\nSimplify:\n\n[2 a² + a b + b²] * (a + b) / [3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4]\n\nSo, E3 = [ (2 a² + a b + b²)(a + b) ] / [3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4]\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(2 a² + a b + b²)(a + b) = 2 a² * a + 2 a² * b + a b * a + a b * b + b² * a + b² * b\n\n= 2 a³ + 2 a² b + a² b + a b² + a b² + b³\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 a³ + (2 a² b + a² b) + (a b² + a b²) + b³\n\n= 2 a³ + 3 a² b + 2 a b² + b³\n\nSo, numerator is 2 a³ + 3 a² b + 2 a b² + b³\n\nDenominator is 3 a^4 + 4 a^3 b + 3 a² b² + a b^3 + b^4\n\nHmm, let me see if the denominator can be factored or related to the numerator.\n\nWait, let me check if denominator is equal to (a + b)(something).

Rozstrzygnąć, czy α musi być liczbą wymierną.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if α must be a rational number given that tan(απ) equals the square root of 2. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the tangent function, tan(x), is periodic with a period of π. That means tan(x + π) = tan(x) for any real number x. So, if tan(απ) = √2, then απ must be an angle whose tangent is √2. But I also know that tan(x) = √2 has infinitely many solutions because the tangent function repeats every π radians.\n\nLet me write that down: απ = arctan(√2) + kπ, where k is any integer. So, solving for α, I get α = (arctan(√2) + kπ)/π. Simplifying that, α = (arctan(√2)/π) + k. So, α is equal to some constant plus an integer k.\n\nNow, the question is whether α must be rational. Well, let's look at the term arctan(√2)/π. If this term is rational, then adding an integer k would still result in a rational number. But if arctan(√2)/π is irrational, then α would be irrational unless k somehow cancels that out, but since k is an integer, it can't change the irrationality of the term.\n\nSo, the key here is whether arctan(√2)/π is rational or not. If it is, then α could be rational for some integer k. But if it's irrational, then α would have to be irrational as well.\n\nI recall that arctan(√2) is a specific angle whose tangent is √2. I wonder if this angle is a rational multiple of π. If it is, then arctan(√2)/π would be rational, making α potentially rational. But I don't remember if arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π.\n\nLet me think about known angles. For example, tan(π/4) = 1, tan(π/3) = √3, tan(π/6) = 1/√3, and so on. √2 isn't one of the standard tangents for the angles we usually learn, like π/4, π/3, etc. So, maybe arctan(√2) isn't a rational multiple of π.\n\nBut wait, is there a theorem or something that says whether arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π? I'm not sure. Maybe I can approach this differently.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that arctan(√2)/π is rational. Let's say arctan(√2)/π = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors. Then, arctan(√2) = (p/q)π. That would mean that tan((p/q)π) = √2.\n\nBut tan((p/q)π) is a transcendental number? Wait, no, tan of a rational multiple of π is usually algebraic, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall that tan(π) = 0, tan(π/2) is undefined, tan(π/4) = 1, tan(π/3) = √3, which is algebraic. So, maybe tan of a rational multiple of π is algebraic.\n\nBut √2 is algebraic, so that doesn't immediately help. However, I remember that if θ is a rational multiple of π, then e^(iθ) is a root of unity, which is algebraic. But tan(θ) can be expressed in terms of e^(iθ), so maybe tan(θ) is algebraic if θ is a rational multiple of π.\n\nBut in our case, tan(θ) = √2, which is algebraic, but does that imply θ is a rational multiple of π? I don't think so. For example, tan(π/4) = 1, which is algebraic, but π/4 is a rational multiple of π. However, tan(π/6) = 1/√3, which is also algebraic, and π/6 is rational. But tan(π/3) = √3, which is algebraic, and π/3 is rational. So, in these cases, it works.\n\nBut what about angles where tan(θ) is algebraic but θ isn't a rational multiple of π? For example, is there a θ = π * r, where r is irrational, such that tan(θ) is algebraic? I think yes. For example, take θ = arctan(√2). If θ is not a rational multiple of π, then r would be irrational, but tan(θ) is still algebraic.\n\nSo, maybe arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, which would mean that arctan(√2)/π is irrational, making α = (arctan(√2)/π) + k irrational for any integer k. Therefore, α must be irrational.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to prove whether arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π? I don't recall any standard results about this. Maybe it's an open question or something. Alternatively, perhaps using some properties of transcendental numbers.\n\nI know that π is transcendental, and so is e. But tan(θ) can sometimes be transcendental even if θ is algebraic. Wait, no, tan(θ) for algebraic θ (in radians) is not necessarily transcendental. For example, tan(π/4) = 1, which is algebraic.\n\nBut in our case, θ = arctan(√2). If θ is a rational multiple of π, then θ = (p/q)π, and tan(θ) = √2. But is there a known result about whether arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π?\n\nI think it's not known, or at least not something I can recall. So, perhaps we can't definitively say whether α must be rational or not based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this using the properties of the tangent function and rationality.\n\nSuppose α is rational, say α = m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors. Then, tan(m/n * π) = √2. So, is there a rational number m/n such that tan(m/n * π) = √2?\n\nI don't think so, because √2 is not one of the standard tangent values for rational multiples of π. The standard ones are 0, 1, √3, etc. So, maybe there's no such rational α that satisfies tan(απ) = √2.\n\nBut wait, that's just an intuition. I need a more rigorous approach.\n\nPerhaps using the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if α is a non-zero algebraic number, then e^(iαπ) is transcendental. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that if α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and tan(απ) would be algebraic, but does that help?\n\nWait, tan(απ) = √2 is algebraic, so if α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and tan(απ) is algebraic. But that doesn't necessarily help us conclude anything about α's rationality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Niven's theorem, which states that the only rational values of θ in radians for which tan(θ) is rational are 0 and π/4, but tan(0) = 0 and tan(π/4) = 1. Since √2 is not rational, this might not apply here.\n\nWait, Niven's theorem is about θ in radians where tan(θ) is rational, but θ is rational. So, if θ is rational, then tan(θ) is rational only for θ = 0, π/4, etc. But in our case, tan(θ) = √2, which is irrational, so Niven's theorem doesn't directly apply.\n\nHmm, maybe I need another approach. Let's consider the equation tan(απ) = √2. If α is rational, say α = p/q, then tan(pπ/q) = √2. So, is there a known result about whether tan(pπ/q) can be √2 for integers p and q?\n\nI think it's not possible because √2 is not one of the standard tangent values for rational angles. But again, this is just intuition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if α is rational, then e^(iαπ) is a root of unity, which is algebraic. But tan(απ) = √2, which is algebraic, but I don't see a direct connection.\n\nWait, let's express tan(απ) in terms of sine and cosine: tan(απ) = sin(απ)/cos(απ) = √2. So, sin(απ) = √2 cos(απ). Squaring both sides, we get sin²(απ) = 2 cos²(απ). Using the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1, we can substitute sin²x = 1 - cos²x, so 1 - cos²(απ) = 2 cos²(απ). This simplifies to 1 = 3 cos²(απ), so cos²(απ) = 1/3, which means cos(απ) = ±1/√3.\n\nSo, cos(απ) = ±1/√3. Therefore, απ must be an angle whose cosine is ±1/√3. So, απ = arccos(1/√3) + 2πk or απ = -arccos(1/√3) + 2πk for some integer k.\n\nThus, α = (arccos(1/√3) + 2πk)/π or α = (-arccos(1/√3) + 2πk)/π. Simplifying, α = arccos(1/√3)/π + 2k or α = -arccos(1/√3)/π + 2k.\n\nNow, arccos(1/√3) is another angle, and similar to before, we can ask whether arccos(1/√3)/π is rational. If it is, then α could be rational for some integer k. If not, then α is irrational.\n\nBut again, I don't know if arccos(1/√3)/π is rational. It seems similar to the previous problem with arctan(√2). Maybe it's irrational, which would imply that α is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a connection between arctan(√2) and arccos(1/√3). Let me see: if θ = arctan(√2), then tanθ = √2, so we can construct a right triangle with opposite side √2 and adjacent side 1, so the hypotenuse would be √(1 + 2) = √3. Therefore, cosθ = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1/√3. So, arctan(√2) = arccos(1/√3). Therefore, arctan(√2) = arccos(1/√3).\n\nSo, both expressions are equal. Therefore, arctan(√2)/π = arccos(1/√3)/π. So, if one is rational, the other is as well. But since we don't know if either is rational, we can't conclude much.\n\nBut wait, if α is rational, then arctan(√2)/π must be rational, as α = arctan(√2)/π + k. So, if α is rational, then arctan(√2)/π is rational. Conversely, if arctan(√2)/π is irrational, then α must be irrational.\n\nSo, the question reduces to whether arctan(√2)/π is rational. If it is, then α can be rational; if not, then α must be irrational.\n\nI think that arctan(√2)/π is irrational, but I'm not entirely sure. I don't recall any standard results that would confirm this. However, given that √2 is not one of the standard tangents for rational multiples of π, it's plausible that arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, making arctan(√2)/π irrational.\n\nTherefore, α must be irrational because it's equal to an irrational number plus an integer, which remains irrational.\n\nWait, but hold on. If α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and tan(απ) is algebraic. But √2 is algebraic, so that doesn't necessarily mean α has to be irrational. It just means that tan(απ) is algebraic.\n\nBut from the earlier steps, we saw that cos(απ) = ±1/√3, which is also algebraic. So, both sine and cosine of απ are algebraic numbers. But does that imply anything about α?\n\nI think not directly. Because even if α is rational, απ is a rational multiple of π, and the sine and cosine of rational multiples of π can be algebraic. For example, cos(π/3) = 1/2, which is algebraic, and π/3 is rational.\n\nBut in our case, cos(απ) = ±1/√3, which is algebraic, but does that force α to be irrational? I don't think so. Because, as I mentioned earlier, there are algebraic numbers whose angles are rational multiples of π, but it's not a given.\n\nWait, but 1/√3 is not a standard cosine value for a rational multiple of π. The standard ones are 0, 1/2, √2/2, 1, etc. So, maybe 1/√3 isn't one of them, implying that απ isn't a standard angle, hence α is irrational.\n\nBut again, this is more of an intuition than a proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if α is rational, then e^(iαπ) is a root of unity, which is algebraic. But tan(απ) = √2, which is algebraic, but I don't see a direct link.\n\nWait, let's consider the equation tan(απ) = √2. If α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, so e^(iαπ) is a root of unity. But tan(απ) = √2, which is algebraic, but not necessarily a root of unity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if α is rational, then απ is a rational angle, and tan(απ) is algebraic.

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a \"cycle\" as a sequence of distinct squares on an n x n chessboard where each consecutive pair of squares shares a common side, and the last square connects back to the first. So, it's like a loop that doesn't repeat any squares. The cycle has to have at least four squares because a cycle with three squares would just be a triangle, which isn't possible on a chessboard since each square only shares sides with up to four others.\n\nThen, a subset X of the chessboard's squares is called \"mean-spirited\" (I think the original word was \"złośliwy\", which translates to \"mean\" or \"sly\" in some contexts, but here it's probably meant to be \"evil\" or \"bad\" in the sense of blocking cycles). The property of X is that every cycle on the chessboard must contain at least one square from X. So, X is like a hitting set for all cycles on the chessboard.\n\nThe question is asking for all real numbers C such that for every integer n ≥ 2, there exists a mean-spiriting set X with at most Cn² squares. So, we need to find the minimal C where this is possible for all n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we need to find the smallest possible C where such a set X exists for any n. I think this is related to graph theory because the chessboard can be represented as a graph where each square is a vertex, and edges connect adjacent squares. Then, a cycle in this graph is just a cycle in the graph theory sense.\n\nIn graph theory, a hitting set for all cycles is called a feedback vertex set. So, X is a feedback vertex set for the chessboard graph. The problem is then asking for the minimal density C such that there exists a feedback vertex set of size at most Cn² for an n x n grid graph.\n\nI remember that for planar graphs, which the chessboard grid is, there are known results about feedback vertex sets. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the chessboard graph is a grid graph, which is a planar bipartite graph. For bipartite graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is related to finding a set of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic. In bipartite graphs, the minimum feedback vertex set is equivalent to the minimum number of vertices to remove to make the graph bipartite, but since it's already bipartite, that might not be directly helpful.\n\nWait, no. Actually, a bipartite graph can still have cycles of even length, so the feedback vertex set needs to break all cycles. For grid graphs, which are planar and bipartite, I think the feedback vertex set problem has been studied.\n\nI recall that in grid graphs, the minimum feedback vertex set can be found using certain patterns or colorings. Maybe if we color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, and then remove every other square, but that might not be sufficient because cycles can still exist.\n\nWait, actually, in a grid graph, every cycle is of even length, and the grid is bipartite. So, to make the graph acyclic, we need to remove enough vertices to break all cycles. One way to do this is to remove all vertices of one color in a checkerboard coloring. Since the grid is bipartite, it can be divided into two color classes, say black and white. If we remove all black squares, then the remaining white squares form a forest (a collection of trees), which is acyclic. Similarly, removing all white squares would also work.\n\nBut wait, in an n x n grid, the number of black squares is roughly (n²)/2. So, if we remove half the squares, we get a feedback vertex set of size (n²)/2. But the problem is asking for the minimal C such that there exists a feedback vertex set of size Cn². So, is (1/2) the minimal C? Or can we do better?\n\nI think maybe we can do better than removing half the squares. Because in a grid, cycles are formed by squares, and perhaps we don't need to remove every other square. Maybe a more efficient hitting set exists.\n\nI remember that in planar graphs, the feedback vertex set problem can sometimes be approximated within a constant factor. But since we need an exact value for C, perhaps it's related to the maximum density of a bipartition or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: in a grid graph, the minimum feedback vertex set is actually equal to the minimum number of vertices that intersect all cycles. For grid graphs, I think the minimum feedback vertex set is known to be roughly n²/2, but maybe it's less.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about small cases. For a 2x2 grid, it's just a square, so the feedback vertex set is 1, because removing one square breaks the cycle. So, for n=2, C would be 1/4.\n\nFor n=3, a 3x3 grid. How many squares do we need to remove to break all cycles? Let's see. The 3x3 grid has a cycle around the perimeter, and also smaller cycles in the center. If we remove the center square, does that break all cycles? No, because the perimeter still forms a cycle. So, we need to remove at least two squares. Maybe the four corner squares? No, that's too many. Alternatively, removing the center and one corner? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, actually, in a 3x3 grid, the minimum feedback vertex set is 2. For example, remove the center and one of the middle edge squares. Then, all cycles are broken. So, for n=3, the size is 2, which is 2/9 ≈ 0.222, which is less than 1/4.\n\nSo, maybe for larger n, the minimal C is less than 1/2.\n\nWait, but for n=2, it's 1/4, for n=3, it's 2/9, which is about 0.222. Let's see n=4. A 4x4 grid. How many squares do we need to remove? Let's see, the 4x4 grid has multiple cycles. If we remove every other square in a checkerboard pattern, that would be 8 squares, which is 1/2 of 16. But maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove a diagonal, say, the main diagonal, which has 4 squares. Does that break all cycles? No, because there are still cycles not involving those squares. For example, the outer perimeter is still a cycle. So, we need to remove more squares.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove two squares from each row or column. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal feedback vertex set for grid graphs is linear in n. For example, maybe it's n. Because in each row, you can remove one square to break the horizontal cycles, but then you still have vertical cycles. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, actually, in a grid graph, the feedback vertex set can be found by removing a matching or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal feedback vertex set is proportional to n. For example, in an n x n grid, you can remove n squares in a way that breaks all cycles. For example, removing a diagonal of n squares. But does that break all cycles? Let's see.\n\nIf you remove the main diagonal, then in each row and each column, there's still a path from one end to the other, so there are still cycles. For example, in a 4x4 grid, removing the main diagonal leaves a cycle that goes around the perimeter and uses the remaining squares. So, that doesn't break all cycles.\n\nAlternatively, if you remove a set of squares such that every cycle has at least one removed square. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a graph and find the minimum vertex cover for the cycle hypergraph.\n\nBut that might be complicated.\n\nWait, another thought: in planar graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is equivalent to finding a set of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic. For planar graphs, it's known that the minimum feedback vertex set can be found in linear time, but I don't know the exact density.\n\nWait, but in grid graphs, which are planar and bipartite, maybe the feedback vertex set is related to the size of a maximum independent set or something else.\n\nWait, in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum feedback vertex set is equal to the number of edges minus the number of edges in a spanning tree. But that might not directly help.\n\nWait, no. For any graph, the size of the minimum feedback vertex set plus the size of the maximum induced forest equals the total number of vertices. So, in our case, the size of X plus the size of the largest induced forest is n². So, to minimize the size of X, we need to maximize the size of the induced forest.\n\nBut in grid graphs, the maximum induced forest is not necessarily the entire graph minus a small set.\n\nWait, in a grid graph, the maximum induced forest is actually the entire graph minus a feedback vertex set. So, if we can find a large induced forest, then the feedback vertex set is small.\n\nBut I don't know the exact maximum size of an induced forest in a grid graph.\n\nWait, but in a grid graph, the maximum induced forest can be as large as n² minus the minimum feedback vertex set. So, if we can find a lower bound on the maximum induced forest, that would give us an upper bound on C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that grid graphs are planar and apply some planar graph properties.\n\nIn planar graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is known to be approximable within a constant factor. But again, we need an exact value.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that in a grid graph, each square can be part of multiple cycles. So, to break all cycles, we need to remove squares that are in many cycles.\n\nBut I don't know how to quantify that.\n\nWait, maybe think about the dual graph. The dual of a grid graph is another grid graph, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem probabilistically. If we randomly remove each square with probability p, what is the expected number of cycles remaining? We want the expected number of cycles to be zero, which would imply that with positive probability, there exists a set X of size pn² that breaks all cycles.\n\nBut this is more of an approach for approximation rather than exact value.\n\nWait, but maybe for the grid graph, the feedback vertex set can be found by removing every third square or something like that. But I don't have a concrete idea.\n\nWait, let me think about the 3x3 grid again. We saw that removing two squares is sufficient. So, for n=3, C=2/9≈0.222. For n=4, maybe we can do better than 1/2.\n\nWait, let's try to find a pattern. If we remove every other square in a checkerboard pattern, that's 8 squares for 4x4, which is 1/2. But maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove squares in a way that every 2x2 block has at least one square removed. Then, in a 4x4 grid, that would require removing 4 squares (one in each 2x2 block). So, 4 squares out of 16, which is 1/4. Does that break all cycles?\n\nWait, let's see. If we remove one square from each 2x2 block, then in each 2x2 block, there's a missing square. So, any cycle that goes through a 2x2 block would have to go around the missing square, but since the rest of the grid is connected, maybe cycles can still form.\n\nWait, for example, in a 4x4 grid, if we remove the center 2x2 squares, then the outer perimeter is still a cycle. So, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if we remove squares in a diagonal pattern, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: in a grid graph, the minimum feedback vertex set is equal to the minimum number of vertices that intersect all the faces. Since each face is a square, and each square face is bounded by four edges. So, to hit all faces, we need to hit each face with at least one vertex.\n\nBut in planar graphs, the feedback vertex set is related to the number of faces. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: in a grid graph, the number of faces is roughly (n-1)², since each inner face is a square. So, if we need to hit each face with at least one vertex, then the minimum feedback vertex set is at least (n-1)² / 4, since each vertex can hit up to four faces. But that's a lower bound.\n\nWait, let's compute that. For an n x n grid, the number of inner faces is (n-1)². Each vertex is part of up to four faces. So, if we need to hit each face with at least one vertex, the minimum number of vertices needed is at least (n-1)² / 4. For large n, this is approximately n² / 4. So, C would be at least 1/4.\n\nBut earlier, for n=3, we saw that C=2/9≈0.222, which is less than 1/4. So, maybe this is a lower bound for large n, but for small n, it's different.\n\nWait, but for n=3, the lower bound would be (3-1)² /4=4/4=1, but we needed 2 squares, so that doesn't match. So, maybe that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower bound is (n-1)² / 2, but that would be 4 for n=3, which is more than needed.\n\nHmm, maybe that approach isn't the right way.\n\nWait, another idea: in a grid graph, the feedback vertex set can be found by removing a set of squares such that every 2x2 square has at least one removed square. This is similar to the hitting set problem for 2x2 squares.\n\nIn that case, the minimum number of squares needed is roughly n² / 2, because in each 2x2 block, you need to remove at least one square, and there are about n² / 4 such blocks, so n² / 4 * 1 = n² /4. But that contradicts the earlier n=3 case where we needed only 2 squares.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as a grid where each row needs to have at least one square removed, but that might not be sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the vertex cover problem in grid graphs. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set. But a feedback vertex set is different; it's about breaking cycles.\n\nWait, in bipartite graphs, the minimum feedback vertex set is equal to the number of vertices minus the size of the maximum induced forest.

I need to figure out what \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) could be. Let me start by thinking about the degrees of these polynomials because that might give me some clues.\n\nLet’s denote the degree of \\( P \\) as \\( m \\) and the degree of \\( Q \\) as \\( n \\). \n\nLooking at the first equation: \\( P(x^2 + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x \\). The left side, \\( P(x^2 + 1) \\), is a composition of \\( P \\) with \\( x^2 + 1 \\). Since \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is a quadratic, the degree of \\( P(x^2 + 1) \\) would be \\( 2m \\).\n\nOn the right side, \\( Q(x)^2 \\) is a square of a polynomial, so its degree is \\( 2n \\), and adding \\( 2x \\) doesn't change the degree. Therefore, the degree of the right side is \\( 2n \\).\n\nSo, equating the degrees from both sides, we have \\( 2m = 2n \\), which simplifies to \\( m = n \\). So, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) must be of the same degree.\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation: \\( Q(x^2 + 1) = P(x)^2 \\). Similarly, the left side \\( Q(x^2 + 1) \\) has degree \\( 2n \\), and the right side \\( P(x)^2 \\) has degree \\( 2m \\). Since \\( m = n \\), both sides have the same degree, which is consistent.\n\nSo, both equations give us that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are of the same degree. Let me think about possible degrees. Maybe starting with low degrees would help.\n\nLet’s try degree 0 first. If both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are constant polynomials, say \\( P(x) = a \\) and \\( Q(x) = b \\). Then, substituting into the first equation:\n\n\\( a = b^2 + 2x \\)\n\nBut this must hold for all real \\( x \\), which is impossible because the right side is linear in \\( x \\) and the left side is constant. So, degree 0 is not possible.\n\nNext, let's try degree 1. Let \\( P(x) = px + q \\) and \\( Q(x) = rx + s \\). Let's substitute into the first equation:\n\n\\( P(x^2 + 1) = p(x^2 + 1) + q = px^2 + p + q \\)\n\nOn the other side, \\( Q(x)^2 + 2x = (rx + s)^2 + 2x = r^2x^2 + 2rsx + s^2 + 2x \\)\n\nSo, equating coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( p = r^2 \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( 0 = 2rs + 2 \\)\n- Constant term: \\( p + q = s^2 \\)\n\nSimilarly, substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( Q(x^2 + 1) = r(x^2 + 1) + s = rx^2 + r + s \\)\n\n\\( P(x)^2 = (px + q)^2 = p^2x^2 + 2pqx + q^2 \\)\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( r = p^2 \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( 0 = 2pq \\)\n- Constant term: \\( r + s = q^2 \\)\n\nSo now, we have a system of equations:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n1. \\( p = r^2 \\)\n2. \\( 0 = 2rs + 2 \\) => \\( rs = -1 \\)\n3. \\( p + q = s^2 \\)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n4. \\( r = p^2 \\)\n5. \\( 0 = 2pq \\) => \\( pq = 0 \\)\n6. \\( r + s = q^2 \\)\n\nLet me try to solve this system step by step.\n\nFrom equation 5: \\( pq = 0 \\).

So, Case 1 is invalid.\n\nCase 2: \\( q = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 5: \\( q = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( rs = -1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( p = r^2 \\)\n\nFrom equation 4: \\( r = p^2 \\) => \\( r = (r^2)^2 = r^4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( r = r^4 \\) => \\( r^4 - r = 0 \\) => \\( r(r^3 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nThus, \\( r = 0 \\) or \\( r^3 = 1 \\) => \\( r = 1 \\)\n\nIf \\( r = 0 \\):\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( 0 * s = -1 \\) => \\( 0 = -1 \\), which is impossible.\n\nIf \\( r = 1 \\):\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( 1 * s = -1 \\) => \\( s = -1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( p = 1^2 = 1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( p + q = s^2 \\) => \\( 1 + 0 = (-1)^2 \\) => \\( 1 = 1 \\), which holds.\n\nFrom equation 6: \\( r + s = q^2 \\) => \\( 1 + (-1) = 0^2 \\) => \\( 0 = 0 \\), which holds.\n\nSo, in this case, we have \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), \\( r = 1 \\), \\( s = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( P(x) = px + q = x \\) and \\( Q(x) = rx + s = x - 1 \\).\n\nLet me check if these satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: \\( P(x^2 + 1) = x^2 + 1 \\). On the other side, \\( Q(x)^2 + 2x = (x - 1)^2 + 2x = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 2x = x^2 + 1 \\). So, that works.\n\nSecond equation: \\( Q(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1) - 1 = x^2 \\). On the other side, \\( P(x)^2 = x^2 \\). So, that also works.\n\nGreat! So, we have a solution \\( P(x) = x \\) and \\( Q(x) = x - 1 \\).\n\nBut the problem says \"find all such pairs\". So, maybe there are more solutions. Let me check if higher degree polynomials can satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet’s assume that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are quadratic polynomials. Let \\( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and \\( Q(x) = dx^2 + ex + f \\).\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n\\( P(x^2 + 1) = a(x^2 + 1)^2 + b(x^2 + 1) + c = a(x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) + b(x^2 + 1) + c = a x^4 + (2a + b) x^2 + (a + b + c) \\)\n\nOn the other side, \\( Q(x)^2 + 2x = (dx^2 + ex + f)^2 + 2x = d^2x^4 + 2dex^3 + (2df + e^2)x^2 + 2efx + f^2 + 2x \\)\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\): \\( a = d^2 \\)\n- \\( x^3 \\): \\( 0 = 2de \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\): \\( 2a + b = 2df + e^2 \\)\n- \\( x \\): \\( 0 = 2ef + 2 \\)\n- Constant term: \\( a + b + c = f^2 \\)\n\nSimilarly, substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( Q(x^2 + 1) = d(x^2 + 1)^2 + e(x^2 + 1) + f = d(x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) + e(x^2 + 1) + f = d x^4 + (2d + e) x^2 + (d + e + f) \\)\n\n\\( P(x)^2 = (a x^2 + b x + c)^2 = a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2 \\)\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\): \\( d = a^2 \\)\n- \\( x^3 \\): \\( 0 = 2ab \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\): \\( 2d + e = 2ac + b^2 \\)\n- \\( x \\): \\( 0 = 2bc \\)\n- Constant term: \\( d + e + f = c^2 \\)\n\nSo, now we have a system of equations from both substitutions.\n\nLet me list all the equations:\n\nFrom first substitution:\n\n1. \\( a = d^2 \\)\n2. \\( 0 = 2de \\)\n3. \\( 2a + b = 2df + e^2 \\)\n4. \\( 0 = 2ef + 2 \\)\n5. \\( a + b + c = f^2 \\)\n\nFrom second substitution:\n\n6. \\( d = a^2 \\)\n7. \\( 0 = 2ab \\)\n8. \\( 0 = 2ac + b^2 \\)\n9. \\( 0 = 2bc \\)\n10. \\( d + e + f = c^2 \\)\n\nThis is a system of 10 equations with variables \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\). Let me try to solve it step by step.\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( 2de = 0 \\) => Either \\( d = 0 \\) or \\( e = 0 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( d = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a = d^2 = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 6: \\( d = a^2 = 0 \\), which is consistent.\n\nFrom equation 7: \\( 0 = 2ab \\). Since \\( a = 0 \\), this holds for any \\( b \\).\n\nFrom equation 8: \\( 0 = 2ac + b^2 \\). Since \\( a = 0 \\), this simplifies to \\( 0 = b^2 \\) => \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( 2a + b = 2df + e^2 \\). Substituting \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( d = 0 \\), we get \\( 0 = 0 + e^2 \\) => \\( e = 0 \\).\n\nFrom equation 4: \\( 0 = 2ef + 2 \\). Since \\( e = 0 \\), this becomes \\( 0 = 0 + 2 \\), which is impossible. So, Case 1 is invalid.\n\nCase 2: \\( e = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( e = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a = d^2 \\)\n\nFrom equation 6: \\( d = a^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( a = d^2 \\) and \\( d = a^2 \\). Let me substitute \\( d = a^2 \\) into \\( a = d^2 \\):\n\n\\( a = (a^2)^2 = a^4 \\)\n\nThus, \\( a^4 - a = 0 \\) => \\( a(a^3 - 1) = 0 \\) => \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( a^3 = 1 \\) => \\( a = 1 \\)\n\nSubcase 2a: \\( a = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a = 0 \\) => \\( d = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 7: \\( 0 = 2ab \\). Since \\( a = 0 \\), holds for any \\( b \\).\n\nFrom equation 8: \\( 0 = 2ac + b^2 \\). Since \\( a = 0 \\), \\( 0 = b^2 \\) => \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( 2a + b = 2df + e^2 \\).

", "response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game called Wu Duosobowa, which is played on the vertices of a regular n-gon, where n is greater than 3. The game involves two players taking turns placing their pawns on the vertices. The key rule here is that a player can only place their pawn on a vertex that isn't adjacent to the vertex occupied by the opponent's pawn. The player who can't make a move loses. I need to determine whether the first player has a winning strategy depending on the value of n.\n\nFirst, I should try to understand the game mechanics better. Let's start by visualizing small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFor n=4, which is a square, the vertices are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. If Player 1 places a pawn at vertex 0, then Player 2 cannot place a pawn at vertices 1 or 3 (since they are adjacent to 0). So Player 2 can only place at vertex 2. Now, Player 1's next move: from vertex 2, the adjacent vertices are 1 and 3. But since Player 2's pawn is at 2, Player 1 can't place at 1 or 3. Wait, but Player 1 can place at vertex 0 again? No, because pawns are placed on unused vertices, and each vertex can only have one pawn. So after Player 1 places at 0, Player 2 at 2, Player 1 can't place anywhere else because all other vertices are adjacent to either 0 or 2. So Player 1 loses. Hmm, that suggests that for n=4, the second player can win.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. After Player 1 places at 0, Player 2 can only place at 2. Now, Player 1's next move: the available vertices are 1 and 3. But placing at 1 would be adjacent to 0 (Player 1's pawn) and 2 (Player 2's pawn). Wait, no, Player 1's pawn is at 0, so placing at 1 is adjacent to 0, which is not allowed. Similarly, placing at 3 is adjacent to 0, which is also not allowed. So Player 1 can't make a move and loses. So for n=4, the second player wins.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider other starting moves. Suppose Player 1 starts at 0, Player 2 at 2. Then Player 1 can't move. Alternatively, if Player 1 starts at 0, Player 2 could start at 1, but wait, no, because Player 2 can't place adjacent to Player 1's pawn. So Player 2 can only place at 2 or 3, but in a square, placing at 2 or 3 would be adjacent to 0? Wait, in a square, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So vertex 0 is adjacent to 1 and 3. So Player 2 can't place at 1 or 3, so only at 2. So Player 2 must place at 2. Then Player 1 can't place anywhere else because 1 and 3 are adjacent to 0, and 2 is already taken. So yes, Player 1 loses.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider n=5, a pentagon. Let's see. Player 1 places at 0. Then Player 2 can place at 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4 are adjacent to 0). Suppose Player 2 places at 2. Now, Player 1 can place at 4 (since 3 is adjacent to 2, and 1 is adjacent to 0, but 4 is adjacent to 0? No, in a pentagon, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So vertex 0 is adjacent to 1 and 4. So placing at 4 would be adjacent to 0, which is not allowed. So Player 1 can only place at 3, which is adjacent to 2, so that's not allowed either. Wait, so Player 1 can't move and loses. Hmm, but that can't be right because in some cases, the first player might have a better move.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps it's better to model this as a graph game where each move blocks certain vertices, and the game ends when a player can't move. The key is to determine if the first player can force a win regardless of the second player's moves.\n\nI recall that in such impartial games, the concept of Grundy numbers or Nimbers can be useful, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe parity plays a role. Let's consider the number of available moves.\n\nIn an n-gon, each vertex has two neighbors. When a player places a pawn on a vertex, it blocks that vertex and its two adjacent vertices from being used by the opponent. So each move effectively removes three vertices from the available pool: the one chosen and its two neighbors. But wait, that's not entirely accurate because if two pawns are placed on adjacent vertices, their blocked areas might overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of independent sets. Each move adds a vertex to the independent set, and the game ends when no more vertices can be added without violating the adjacency rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to the game of Kayles or Cram, where players take turns placing pieces on a graph, and the last to place wins.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the game as a variant of the matching game. Each move blocks certain vertices, and the game is about making the last possible move.\n\nLet me try to think recursively. For a given n, can the first player make a move that leaves the second player in a losing position?\n\nFor n=4, as we saw, the first player can't make a move after the second player's response, so the second player wins.\n\nFor n=5, let's see. Player 1 places at 0. Then Player 2 can place at 2 or 3. Suppose Player 2 places at 2. Now, Player 1 can place at 4, but that's adjacent to 0, which is not allowed. Alternatively, Player 1 can place at 3, but that's adjacent to 2, which is occupied by Player 2. So Player 1 can't move and loses. Wait, but maybe Player 2 could have placed at 3 instead. Let's see: Player 1 at 0, Player 2 at 3. Then Player 1 can place at 2, which is adjacent to 3, so not allowed. Alternatively, Player 1 can place at 4, which is adjacent to 0, so not allowed. So again, Player 1 can't move and loses. Hmm, so for n=5, the second player also wins.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's try n=6, a hexagon. Player 1 places at 0. Player 2 can place at 2 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are adjacent to 0). Suppose Player 2 places at 2. Now, Player 1 can place at 4, which is adjacent to 2, so not allowed. Alternatively, Player 1 can place at 5, which is adjacent to 0, so not allowed. Wait, so Player 1 can't move and loses. Hmm, but that can't be right because maybe Player 2 could have placed at 4 instead. Let's see: Player 1 at 0, Player 2 at 4. Then Player 1 can place at 2, which is adjacent to 4? No, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, not 4. Wait, in a hexagon, vertex 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. So placing at 2 is not adjacent to 4. So Player 1 can place at 2. Now, Player 2's turn: available vertices are 1, 3, 5. Player 2 can't place adjacent to 2 or 4. So placing at 1 is adjacent to 2, so not allowed. Placing at 3 is adjacent to 4, so not allowed. Placing at 5 is adjacent to 0, which is occupied by Player 1, so not allowed. So Player 2 can't move and loses. Wait, so in this case, Player 1 wins.\n\nWait, so for n=6, if Player 2 responds at 4, then Player 1 can win. But earlier, when Player 2 responded at 2, Player 1 couldn't move. So maybe the outcome depends on how Player 2 responds. But in the game, Player 2 will try to win, so they would choose the move that leads to their victory. So in n=6, if Player 2 responds at 2, Player 1 loses. But if Player 2 responds at 4, Player 1 can win. So Player 2 would choose the move that leads to their victory, which is responding at 2, making Player 1 lose. So for n=6, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me try again. Player 1 at 0. Player 2 can choose between 2 and 4. If Player 2 chooses 2, then Player 1 can't move, as placing at 4 is adjacent to 2, and placing at 5 is adjacent to 0. So Player 1 loses. If Player 2 chooses 4, then Player 1 can place at 2, and then Player 2 can't move, so Player 1 wins. But since Player 2 is playing optimally, they would choose the move that leads to their victory, which is responding at 2, making Player 1 lose. So for n=6, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider other starting moves. Suppose Player 1 starts at 0. Player 2 can choose between 2 and 4. If Player 2 chooses 2, Player 1 can't move. If Player 2 chooses 4, Player 1 can move to 2, and then Player 2 can't move. So Player 2 would choose 2 to make Player 1 lose. So for n=6, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider n=5 again. If Player 1 starts at 0, Player 2 can choose 2 or 3. Suppose Player 2 chooses 2. Then Player 1 can't move because placing at 4 is adjacent to 0, and placing at 3 is adjacent to 2. So Player 1 loses. Similarly, if Player 2 chooses 3, Player 1 can't move. So for n=5, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for n=6, the second player can win, but maybe I should check n=7.\n\nFor n=7, Player 1 places at 0. Player 2 can place at 2, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, no, because in a heptagon, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So from 0, the adjacent vertices are 1 and 6. So Player 2 can place at 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 6. Wait, no, Player 2 can place at any vertex except 0 and its adjacent vertices, which are 1 and 6. So Player 2 can choose from 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nSuppose Player 2 chooses 3. Then Player 1 can choose 5, which is not adjacent to 3 or 0. Now, Player 2 can choose 1, but that's adjacent to 0, so not allowed. Alternatively, Player 2 can choose 4, which is adjacent to 3, so not allowed. Or 2, which is adjacent to 3? No, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. So placing at 2 is adjacent to 3, so not allowed. So Player 2 can't move and loses. Wait, so in this case, Player 1 wins.\n\nBut wait, maybe Player 2 would choose a different move. Suppose Player 2 chooses 2 instead of 3. Then Player 1 can choose 4, which is not adjacent to 2 or 0. Now, Player 2 can choose 5, which is adjacent to 0, so not allowed. Or 6, which is adjacent to 0, so not allowed. Or 1, which is adjacent to 0, so not allowed. So Player 2 can't move and loses. So in this case, Player 1 wins.\n\nAlternatively, if Player 2 chooses 4, then Player 1 can choose 2, which is not adjacent to 4 or 0. Then Player 2 can't move, so Player 1 wins.\n\nWait, so in n=7, regardless of where Player 2 places, Player 1 can win. So for n=7, the first player can win.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe the outcome depends on whether n is even or odd. For n=4 (even), second player wins. For n=5 (odd), second player wins. For n=6 (even), second player wins. For n=7 (odd), first player wins. Hmm, that doesn't fit a clear pattern. Maybe it's more nuanced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to consider the game as a variant of the Kayles game, where the first player can win if the number of vertices is odd, and lose if even. But in our earlier examples, for n=4 (even), second player wins; n=5 (odd), second player wins; n=6 (even), second player wins; n=7 (odd), first player wins. That doesn't align with the Kayles idea.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the maximum matching. Each move blocks certain vertices, and the game ends when no more moves can be made. The total number of moves possible is floor(n/2). Wait, no, because each move blocks three vertices (the chosen one and its two neighbors), but overlapping can occur.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is equivalent to placing non-attacking kings on a circular chessboard, where each king occupies a square and blocks its adjacent squares. The maximum number of non-attacking kings on an n-gon is floor(n/2). So the total number of moves is floor(n/2). If floor(n/2) is odd, the first player wins; if even, the second player wins.\n\nWait, let's test this. For n=4, floor(4/2)=2, which is even, so second player wins. For n=5, floor(5/2)=2, even, so second player wins. For n=6, floor(6/2)=3, odd, so first player wins. For n=7, floor(7/2)=3, odd, so first player wins. That seems to align with our earlier examples.\n\nSo, the total number of moves possible is floor(n/2).", "answer": "Załóżmy, że pierwszym graczem jest Ewa, a drugim — Jan. Wykażemy, że jeśli liczba n jest parzysta, to strategię wygrywającą ma Jan, a jeśli liczba n jest nieparzysta — Ewa. Zacznijmy od pierwszego przypadku.

To gwarantuje mu wygraną w oczywisty sposób, niezależnie od poczynań swej przeciwniczki.\n\nTeraz załóżmy, że n jest nieparzyste. Ewa stawia gdzieś swój pionek, co powoduje, że Jan nie może korzystać z trzech pól. Wyobraźmy sobie, że gracze przenoszą się na wielokąt, który ma n − 1 wierzchołków. Są tam dwa pola sąsiednie zakazane dla Jana, ale nie dla Ewy. Teraz Jan stawia gdzieś swój pionek, a Ewa stawia na polu symetrycznym względem środka (n−1)-kąta.

Each equation looks similar, and it's cyclic because the last one connects back to the first variable. Let me write them down again to get a clearer picture:\n\n1. 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n2. 2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₃ + 3)\n...\nn. 2xₙ³ + 4 = xₙ²(x₁ + 3)\n\nHmm, each equation is of the form 2x_i³ + 4 = x_i²(x_{i+1} + 3), where the indices wrap around, so x_{n+1} is x₁. I need to find all solutions for x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to find a pattern or see if all variables are equal. That often works in symmetric systems. Let me assume that x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = k, where k is some constant. Then, substituting into the first equation:\n\n2k³ + 4 = k²(k + 3)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n2k³ + 4 = k³ + 3k²\n\nSubtract k³ + 3k² from both sides:\n\n2k³ + 4 - k³ - 3k² = 0\nk³ - 3k² + 4 = 0\n\nSo, I have the equation k³ - 3k² + 4 = 0. Let me try to factor this. Maybe rational roots? The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTesting k=1: 1 - 3 + 4 = 2 ≠ 0\nk=2: 8 - 12 + 4 = 0. Oh, k=2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (k - 2):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide k³ - 3k² + 4 by (k - 2):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -3 | 0 | 4\n\nWait, hold on, the polynomial is k³ - 3k² + 4, which is k³ - 3k² + 0k + 4.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to -3: -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by 2: -2. Add to 0: -2.\n\nMultiply -2 by 2: -4. Add to 4: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (k - 2)(k² - k - 2). Now factor the quadratic:\n\nk² - k - 2 = (k - 2)(k + 1). Wait, no, because (k - 2)(k + 1) = k² - k - 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (k - 2)²(k + 1) = 0. Therefore, the roots are k = 2 (double root) and k = -1.\n\nSo, if all variables are equal, the solutions are x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = 2 or x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = -1.\n\nBut wait, are these the only solutions? Maybe there are solutions where variables are not all equal. Let me check.\n\nSuppose that not all x_i are equal. Let me see if I can find another solution.\n\nLooking at the first equation: 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3). Let me rearrange it:\n\n2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²x₂ + 3x₁²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2x₁³ - 3x₁² - x₁²x₂ + 4 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe express x₂ in terms of x₁:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²x₂ + 3x₁²\n\nSubtract 3x₁² from both sides:\n\n2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4 = x₁²x₂\n\nDivide both sides by x₁² (assuming x₁ ≠ 0):\n\nx₂ = (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁² = 2x₁ - 3 + 4/x₁²\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²x₃ + 3x₂²\n\nSo, x₃ = (2x₂³ - 3x₂² + 4)/x₂² = 2x₂ - 3 + 4/x₂²\n\nContinuing this way, each x_{i+1} is expressed in terms of x_i as:\n\nx_{i+1} = 2x_i - 3 + 4/x_i²\n\nSo, this is a recursive relation. If I can find a cycle where after n steps, it comes back to x₁, that would give me a solution.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can analyze the function f(t) = 2t - 3 + 4/t².\n\nIf I can find fixed points or cycles of this function, that might help.\n\nFirst, fixed points: f(t) = t\n\nSo, 2t - 3 + 4/t² = t\n\nSubtract t:\n\nt - 3 + 4/t² = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by t²:\n\nt³ - 3t² + 4 = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before: t³ - 3t² + 4 = 0, which factors as (t - 2)²(t + 1) = 0. So, fixed points are t = 2 and t = -1.\n\nSo, if each x_i is a fixed point, then all variables are equal, which gives the solutions we found earlier.\n\nBut what about cycles? For example, a 2-cycle where x_{i+1} = f(x_i) and x_{i+2} = x_i.\n\nBut since the system is cyclic with n variables, unless n divides 2, which is only possible for n=2, but n is given as n ≥ 2. So, for n=2, a 2-cycle might exist, but for higher n, it's more complicated.\n\nWait, but the problem says n ≥ 2, so n could be 2, 3, etc. So, maybe for n=2, there are more solutions, but for higher n, only the constant solutions exist.\n\nLet me test n=2.\n\nFor n=2, the system is:\n\n1. 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n2. 2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₁ + 3)\n\nAssume x₁ = x₂ = k, then as before, k=2 or k=-1.\n\nBut maybe there are solutions where x₁ ≠ x₂.\n\nLet me try to solve the system for n=2.\n\nFrom equation 1: x₂ = (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁²\n\nFrom equation 2: x₁ = (2x₂³ - 3x₂² + 4)/x₂²\n\nSo, substitute x₂ from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\nx₁ = [2*( (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁² )³ - 3*( (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁² )² + 4] / [ ( (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁² )² ]\n\nThis looks really messy, but maybe I can plug in x₁=2 and x₁=-1 to see if they satisfy.\n\nFor x₁=2:\n\nx₂ = (2*(8) - 3*(4) + 4)/4 = (16 - 12 + 4)/4 = 8/4 = 2. So, x₂=2, which is consistent.\n\nFor x₁=-1:\n\nx₂ = (2*(-1)^3 - 3*(-1)^2 + 4)/(-1)^2 = (-2 - 3 + 4)/1 = (-1)/1 = -1. So, x₂=-1, consistent.\n\nWhat about other solutions? Maybe x₁= something else.\n\nSuppose x₁=1:\n\nx₂ = (2*1 - 3*1 + 4)/1 = (2 - 3 + 4) = 3\n\nThen, plug x₂=3 into equation 2:\n\nx₁ = [2*(27) - 3*(9) + 4]/9 = (54 - 27 + 4)/9 = 31/9 ≈ 3.444\n\nBut we started with x₁=1, so this doesn't loop back. So, x₁=1 is not a solution.\n\nSimilarly, try x₁=4:\n\nx₂ = (2*64 - 3*16 + 4)/16 = (128 - 48 + 4)/16 = 84/16 = 21/4 = 5.25\n\nThen, x₁ = [2*(5.25)^3 - 3*(5.25)^2 + 4]/(5.25)^2\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n2*(144.703125) - 3*(27.5625) + 4 = 289.40625 - 82.6875 + 4 ≈ 209.71875\n\nDenominator: 27.5625\n\nSo, x₁ ≈ 209.71875 / 27.5625 ≈ 7.6\n\nNot equal to 4, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x₁= something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x₁=0? But x₁=0 would make denominators undefined in the expression for x₂, so x₁ cannot be 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x₁= sqrt(2) or something, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only solutions for n=2 are the constant solutions.\n\nSimilarly, for higher n, maybe the only solutions are the constant ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where variables alternate between two values, but for n even, that could work, but for n odd, it might not.\n\nBut the problem says n ≥ 2, so n could be any integer starting from 2.\n\nBut the problem is to solve the system for general n, so maybe the only solutions are the constant ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all variables must be equal.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nSuppose that not all variables are equal.

The function has to satisfy two conditions: first, \\( f(0) \\) must be greater than 0, and second, for every integer \\( k \\), the smallest number among all \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) where \\( l \\) is any integer, should be equal to \\( f(k) \\).\n\nHmm, let me try to unpack this. The first condition is straightforward: \\( f(0) > 0 \\). So, \\( f(0) \\) has to be at least 1 because it's a non-negative integer. The second condition is a bit trickier. It says that for any integer \\( k \\), if I take all possible \\( l \\) (which can be any integer, positive or negative), compute \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\), and then take the minimum of all those values, it should equal \\( f(k) \\).\n\nWait, so for each \\( k \\), \\( f(k) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\). That sounds a lot like the definition of a function that satisfies the triangle inequality. In other words, \\( f(k) \\) is the infimum (or minimum, in this case) of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) for all \\( l \\). This reminds me of metrics or norms, where the distance from a point to itself is zero, but here \\( f(0) \\) is positive. Hmm, maybe it's similar to a seminorm, but with the positivity condition.\n\nBut in this case, \\( f \\) maps integers to non-negative integers, so it's discrete. Let me think about possible functions. The simplest function that comes to mind is a constant function. Suppose \\( f(k) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\geq 0 \\). Then, for any \\( k \\), \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = c + c = 2c \\). The minimum of all these would be \\( 2c \\), so we would have \\( f(k) = 2c \\). But since \\( f(k) = c \\), this would require \\( c = 2c \\), which implies \\( c = 0 \\). But \\( f(0) > 0 \\), so this is impossible. Therefore, a constant function doesn't work unless \\( c = 0 \\), which is not allowed.\n\nOkay, so constant functions are out. How about linear functions? Let's suppose \\( f(k) = |k| \\times c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Then, \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = |k - l| \\times c + |l| \\times c = c(|k - l| + |l|) \\). The minimum of this over all integers \\( l \\) would be when \\( l \\) is as close as possible to \\( k/2 \\), but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, for real numbers, the minimum of \\( |k - l| + |l| \\) is \\( |k| \\), achieved when \\( l \\) is between 0 and \\( k \\). But since \\( l \\) has to be an integer, the minimum would be either \\( |k| \\) or something close. But in our case, \\( f(k) = c|k| \\), so the minimum would be \\( c|k| \\), which is equal to \\( f(k) \\). So, does this satisfy the condition?\n\nWait, let's test it. Let me take \\( c = 1 \\) for simplicity, so \\( f(k) = |k| \\). Then, for any \\( k \\), \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = |k - l| + |l| \\). The minimum of this over all integers \\( l \\) is indeed \\( |k| \\), because \\( |k - l| + |l| \\geq |k| \\) by the triangle inequality, and equality holds when \\( l \\) is between 0 and \\( k \\). So, in this case, the minimum is \\( |k| \\), which is exactly \\( f(k) \\). So, \\( f(k) = |k| \\) seems to satisfy the second condition.\n\nBut wait, what about \\( f(0) \\)? If \\( f(k) = |k| \\), then \\( f(0) = 0 \\), which violates the first condition that \\( f(0) > 0 \\). So, that's a problem. Maybe I can adjust it slightly. What if I define \\( f(k) = |k| + 1 \\)? Then, \\( f(0) = 1 \\), which satisfies the first condition. Let's check the second condition. For any \\( k \\), \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = (|k - l| + 1) + (|l| + 1) = |k - l| + |l| + 2 \\). The minimum of \\( |k - l| + |l| \\) is \\( |k| \\), so the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) would be \\( |k| + 2 \\). But \\( f(k) = |k| + 1 \\), so \\( |k| + 2 \\) is greater than \\( |k| + 1 \\). Therefore, the minimum is not equal to \\( f(k) \\), so this function doesn't satisfy the second condition.\n\nHmm, so adding a constant doesn't work. Maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about the properties required. The function \\( f \\) must satisfy that for every \\( k \\), \\( f(k) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\). This is similar to the concept of a function being additive, but not quite. It's more like a recursive definition where each value is built from smaller values.\n\nWait, if I think about it, this condition is similar to the definition of a metric, except that in a metric, \\( f(k) = 0 \\) only when \\( k = 0 \\). Here, \\( f(0) > 0 \\), so it's not a metric. But the condition is similar: the function's value at a point is the minimum of the sum of its values at two other points that add up to it.\n\nThis reminds me of the concept of a valuation in mathematics, or perhaps something related to dynamic programming where you build up solutions from smaller subproblems.\n\nLet me try to see if such a function can exist. Suppose \\( f(0) = c \\) where \\( c > 0 \\). Then, for \\( k = 0 \\), the condition says that the minimum of \\( f(0 - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\) is equal to \\( f(0) = c \\). So, \\( c \\) must be the minimum of \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\) for all \\( l \\). Since \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\geq 2f(0) = 2c \\) if \\( f \\) is symmetric, but we don't know if it's symmetric yet.\n\nWait, maybe \\( f \\) is symmetric? Let's check. If \\( f(k) = f(-k) \\), then \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = f(l - k) + f(l) \\), which might help. But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is always equal to \\( f(-k) \\). Let's assume that for a moment. Then, for \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum of \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\) is \\( 2c \\), which must equal \\( c \\). So, \\( 2c = c \\), implying \\( c = 0 \\), which is not allowed. So, that can't be. Therefore, \\( f(k) \\) cannot be symmetric in that way.\n\nWait, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is not symmetric. Let's think differently. Suppose \\( f(k) \\) is a function that is zero except at \\( k = 0 \\), but that's not allowed because \\( f(0) > 0 \\). Alternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is always positive, but how?\n\nWait, let's try to see if such a function can exist. Let's suppose that \\( f(k) \\) is always equal to \\( c \\) for some constant \\( c > 0 \\). But as I saw earlier, that leads to a contradiction because \\( c = 2c \\) implies \\( c = 0 \\), which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is a linear function, but as I saw earlier, that leads to \\( f(0) = 0 \\), which is not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is an exponential function? Let's suppose \\( f(k) = a^{|k|} \\) for some \\( a > 0 \\). Then, \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = a^{|k - l|} + a^{|l|} \\). The minimum of this over all integers \\( l \\) would depend on \\( k \\). For example, if \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( f(1 - l) + f(l) = a^{|1 - l|} + a^{|l|} \\). The minimum occurs when \\( l = 0 \\) or \\( l = 1 \\), giving \\( a + 1 \\) or \\( 1 + a \\), so the minimum is \\( a + 1 \\). But \\( f(1) = a \\), so we would need \\( a = a + 1 \\), which is impossible. So, exponential functions don't work either.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about this differently. Let's consider small values of \\( k \\) and see if we can find a pattern or a contradiction.\n\nFirst, \\( f(0) = c > 0 \\). Let's denote \\( c = f(0) \\).\n\nNow, consider \\( k = 1 \\). The condition says that the minimum of \\( f(1 - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\) is equal to \\( f(1) \\). Let's see what possible values \\( l \\) can take.\n\nIf \\( l = 0 \\), then \\( f(1) + f(0) = f(1) + c \\).\n\nIf \\( l = 1 \\), then \\( f(0) + f(1) = c + f(1) \\).\n\nIf \\( l = -1 \\), then \\( f(2) + f(-1) \\). But we don't know \\( f(2) \\) or \\( f(-1) \\) yet.\n\nWait, but to find the minimum, we need to consider all possible \\( l \\). However, without knowing \\( f \\) for other values, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can assume some symmetry or other properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( f(k) \\) is a constant function except at 0, but that seems unlikely because of the earlier contradiction.\n\nWait, another thought: if \\( f(k) \\) is always greater than or equal to \\( c \\), then \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\geq 2c \\). But the minimum of these sums must be equal to \\( f(k) \\). So, for each \\( k \\), there must exist some \\( l \\) such that \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = f(k) \\). But since \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\geq 2c \\), this implies that \\( f(k) \\geq 2c \\) for all \\( k \\).\n\nBut wait, if \\( f(k) \\geq 2c \\) for all \\( k \\), then for \\( k = 0 \\), \\( f(0) \\geq 2c \\). But \\( f(0) = c \\), so \\( c \\geq 2c \\), which implies \\( c \\leq 0 \\). But \\( c > 0 \\), so this is a contradiction. Therefore, such a function cannot exist.\n\nWait, that seems like a solid argument. Let me rephrase it:\n\nAssume that such a function \\( f \\) exists. Then, for any integer \\( k \\), \\( f(k) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\). Since \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\geq 2c \\) for all \\( l \\) (because \\( f(k - l) \\geq c \\) and \\( f(l) \\geq c \\)), the minimum must also be at least \\( 2c \\). Therefore, \\( f(k) \\geq 2c \\) for all \\( k \\). But for \\( k = 0 \\), \\( f(0) \\geq 2c \\). However, \\( f(0) = c \\), so \\( c \\geq 2c \\), which implies \\( c \\leq 0 \\). But \\( c > 0 \\), so this is a contradiction. Therefore, no such function \\( f \\) can exist.\n\nSo, after going through this reasoning, it seems that such a function cannot exist because it leads to a contradiction where \\( c \\) must be both greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, which is impossible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{Nie}}\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining if there exists a function \\( f \\) that maps every integer \\( k \\) to a non-negative integer \\( f(k) \\) and satisfies two conditions: \\( f(0) > 0 \\) and for every integer \\( k \\), the smallest value among all \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) for any integer \\( l \\) is equal to \\( f(k) \\).\n\n1.

This implies that \\( f(k) \\geq 2c \\) for all \\( k \\).
