", "response": "Alright, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the possible ratios of |AT| to |DE| in a given configuration. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the components:\n\nWe have a triangle ABC, and T is its centroid. That makes sense because the centroid is the intersection point of the medians, and it's the center of mass of the triangle. \n\nNext, there's a point K in the half-plane (I think that means the half-plane determined by BC that doesn't contain A) such that triangle BTK is a right isosceles triangle with base BT. Similarly, there's a point L in the half-plane determined by CT (I assume this is the half-plane containing A) such that triangle CTL is a right isosceles triangle with base CT.\n\nThen, D is the midpoint of BC, which is straightforward. E is the midpoint of KL. The question is asking for all possible values of the ratio |AT| : |DE|.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find how |AT| relates to |DE| in this configuration. Since T is the centroid, I know that AT is a median, and in a triangle, the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. So, |AT| is two-thirds the length of the median from A to BC.\n\nBut DE is a bit more complicated. DE connects the midpoints of BC and KL. So, maybe I can use some midpoint theorems or vector methods here.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a triangle, the centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. So, if I can find the coordinates of all these points, maybe I can compute the lengths.\n\nPerhaps coordinate geometry would be a good approach here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates because placing A at the origin might simplify calculations, and scaling the coordinates by 2 might help in dealing with midpoints and centroids more easily.\n\nSo, the centroid T of triangle ABC would be the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. Therefore, T would be at ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).\n\nNow, let's find points K and L.\n\nStarting with point K: it's in the half-plane BTC, which I think is the half-plane determined by BC that doesn't contain A. So, K is such that triangle BTK is a right isosceles triangle with base BT.\n\nSimilarly, L is in the half-plane CTA, which is the half-plane determined by CT that doesn't contain B, I believe, such that triangle CTL is a right isosceles triangle with base CT.\n\nSince both K and L are defined with respect to right isosceles triangles, their positions can be determined relative to points B and C.\n\nLet me recall that in a right isosceles triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the legs. So, if BTK is right-angled at T, then BT is the base, and the legs are BK and TK, which are equal in length.\n\nWait, no. If it's a right isosceles triangle with base BT, then the right angle is at T, and the legs are BT and TK, so BT = TK, and angle at T is 90 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle_CTL, it's right-angled at T, with base CT, so CT = TL, and angle at T is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, both K and L are points such that they form right isosceles triangles with BT and CT respectively, with the right angle at T.\n\nTherefore, to find K and L, I can use rotation. Since K is such that BT is the base, and the triangle is right-angled at T, K can be obtained by rotating point B around T by 90 degrees, either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the orientation.\n\nSimilarly, L can be obtained by rotating point C around T by 90 degrees.\n\nBut since K is in the half-plane BTC, which is the half-plane containing T and B and C, I need to figure out the direction of rotation.\n\nWait, actually, the half-plane BTC is determined by the line BC. Since T is the centroid, it's inside the triangle, so the half-plane BTC would be the side where A is not located. So, K is on the same side as A with respect to BC.\n\nSimilarly, L is in the half-plane CTA, which is the half-plane containing A with respect to CT.\n\nHmm, maybe I should use vectors to represent these points.\n\nLet me denote vectors with boldface letters. Let me set coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (2b, 0), and C at (2c, 2d). Then, T is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).\n\nFirst, let's find vector BT. Since B is at (2b, 0) and T is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3), vector BT is T - B = ((2b + 2c)/3 - 2b, (2d)/3 - 0) = ((-4b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).\n\nSimilarly, vector CT is T - C = ((2b + 2c)/3 - 2c, (2d)/3 - 2d) = ((2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3).\n\nNow, to find point K, which is such that triangle BTK is right-angled at T with BT as the base. So, vector TK should be equal in length to BT and perpendicular to BT.\n\nSince BT is the base, and the triangle is right-angled at T, the vector TK should be a 90-degree rotation of vector BT.\n\nIn 2D, rotating a vector (x, y) by 90 degrees counterclockwise gives (-y, x), and clockwise gives (y, -x). So, depending on the orientation, K can be on one side or the other.\n\nBut since K is in the half-plane BTC, which is the half-plane containing T and B and C, I need to figure out the direction of rotation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute both possibilities and see which one lies in the correct half-plane.\n\nSo, vector BT is ((-4b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3). Rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise would give (-2d/3, (-4b + 2c)/3). So, vector TK would be this, so point K would be T + vector TK.\n\nSimilarly, rotating vector BT 90 degrees clockwise would give (2d/3, (4b - 2c)/3), so point K would be T + this vector.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, counterclockwise rotation:\n\nVector TK_ccw = (-2d/3, (-4b + 2c)/3)\n\nSo, point K_ccw = T + TK_ccw = ((2b + 2c)/3 - 2d/3, (2d)/3 + (-4b + 2c)/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx-coordinate: (2b + 2c - 2d)/3\n\ny-coordinate: (2d - 4b + 2c)/3\n\nSimilarly, clockwise rotation:\n\nVector TK_cw = (2d/3, (4b - 2c)/3)\n\nPoint K_cw = T + TK_cw = ((2b + 2c)/3 + 2d/3, (2d)/3 + (4b - 2c)/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx-coordinate: (2b + 2c + 2d)/3\n\ny-coordinate: (2d + 4b - 2c)/3\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these points lies in the half-plane BTC.\n\nSince the half-plane BTC is determined by the line BC, and T is inside the triangle, the correct point K should lie on the same side as A with respect to BC.\n\nWait, actually, the half-plane BTC is the half-plane containing T, B, and C, which is the same as the original triangle. So, point K should lie in the same half-plane as A, which is the side opposite to BC.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the half-plane BTC is determined by the line BC, so it's the half-plane that contains point T. Since T is the centroid, it's inside the triangle, so the half-plane BTC is the same as the half-plane containing the triangle ABC.\n\nTherefore, point K should lie in the same half-plane as A with respect to BC.\n\nSo, to check which of K_ccw or K_cw lies in the half-plane containing A, we can compute the position relative to line BC.\n\nThe line BC can be represented by the equation. Let me compute it.\n\nPoints B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b). So, the equation of BC is y = [d/(c - b)](x - 2b).\n\nTo determine on which side a point lies, we can plug the point into the equation and see if it's above or below.\n\nLet me compute for point K_ccw: ((2b + 2c - 2d)/3, (2d - 4b + 2c)/3)\n\nCompute y - [d/(c - b)](x - 2b):\n\n= (2d - 4b + 2c)/3 - [d/(c - b)] * [ (2b + 2c - 2d)/3 - 2b ]\n\nSimplify the x term:\n\n(2b + 2c - 2d)/3 - 2b = (2b + 2c - 2d - 6b)/3 = (-4b + 2c - 2d)/3\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n(2d - 4b + 2c)/3 - [d/(c - b)] * (-4b + 2c - 2d)/3\n\nFactor out 1/3:\n\n[ (2d - 4b + 2c) - d/(c - b) * (-4b + 2c - 2d) ] / 3\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n2d - 4b + 2c + [d/(c - b)]*(4b - 2c + 2d)\n\n= 2d - 4b + 2c + [d*(4b - 2c + 2d)]/(c - b)\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of computing this, I can use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since K is in the half-plane BTC, which is the same as the half-plane containing T, which is inside the triangle. So, point K should lie on the same side as A with respect to BC.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the half-plane BTC is determined by BC, so it's the half-plane that contains T, which is the centroid. Since the centroid is inside the triangle, the half-plane BTC is the same as the half-plane containing the triangle ABC. Therefore, point K should lie in the same half-plane as A with respect to BC.\n\nSo, to check whether K_ccw or K_cw is on the same side as A, we can plug in point A(0,0) into the line BC equation and see the sign.\n\nCompute y - [d/(c - b)](x - 2b) at point A(0,0):\n\n= 0 - [d/(c - b)](0 - 2b) = 0 - [d/(c - b)]*(-2b) = 2b d / (c - b)\n\nThe sign of this expression depends on the denominator (c - b) and the numerator (2b d). Since we don't know the specific values, it's hard to tell, but perhaps we can assume that the triangle is oriented such that c > b, so c - b is positive. Then, the sign is positive if 2b d is positive, which would be if b and d have the same sign.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too convoluted. Perhaps instead of using coordinates, I can use vectors or complex numbers.\n\nWait, maybe using vectors is better. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote vectors with boldface letters. Let me set point A as the origin, so A = (0,0). Let me denote vectors AB as **b** and AC as **c**. Then, the centroid T is given by ( **b** + **c** ) / 3.\n\nWait, no. If A is at (0,0), B is at (2b, 0), and C is at (2c, 2d), then vector AB is (2b, 0), and vector AC is (2c, 2d). So, the centroid T is ( (0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 ) = ( (2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 ).\n\nSo, vector BT is T - B = ( (2b + 2c)/3 - 2b, (2d)/3 - 0 ) = ( (-4b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 )\n\nSimilarly, vector CT is T - C = ( (2b + 2c)/3 - 2c, (2d)/3 - 2d ) = ( (2b - 4c)/3, (-4d)/3 )\n\nNow, to find point K, which is such that triangle BTK is right-angled at T with base BT. So, vector TK should be equal in length to BT and perpendicular to BT.\n\nVector BT is ( (-4b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3 ). So, its length squared is [ (-4b + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ] / 9.\n\nVector TK should have the same length and be perpendicular to BT. So, the dot product of BT and TK should be zero.\n\nLet me denote vector TK as (x, y). Then:\n\n1. ( (-4b + 2c)/3 ) * x + ( (2d)/3 ) * y = 0 (perpendicular)\n2. x^2 + y^2 = [ (-4b + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ] / 9 (same length)\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n( (-4b + 2c) x + 2d y ) / 3 = 0 => (-4b", "answer": "Najprv odvodíme, že \\(|TD| / |DE| = \\sqrt{2}\\).

{"original_question": "Koľko neprázdnych podmnožín množiny {0, 1, ..., 9} má súčet prvkov deliteľný 3?", "question": "Koľko neprázdnych podmnožín množiny {0, 1, ..., 9} má súčet prvkov deliteľný 3?", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to find out how many non-empty subsets of the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} have a sum of elements that's divisible by 3. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with subsets and divisibility, generating functions can be a useful tool. Maybe I can use that here. Let me recall how generating functions work for subset sums. For each element in the set, we can represent it as a polynomial where the exponent represents the element's value, and the coefficient represents the number of ways to achieve that sum. So, for each number, we have a term like (1 + x^k), where k is the number. Multiplying all these together gives a generating function where the coefficient of x^m tells us how many subsets sum to m.\n\nIn this case, our set is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. So, the generating function would be the product from k=0 to 9 of (1 + x^k). But wait, 0 is in the set. Including 0 in the subsets is a bit tricky because adding 0 doesn't change the sum. So, when considering subsets, 0 can either be included or not, but it doesn't affect the sum. However, since we're looking for non-empty subsets, we have to make sure we don't count the empty set.\n\nBut before I get into that, let me think about the generating function approach. The generating function for the entire set would be:\n\nG(x) = (1 + x^0)(1 + x^1)(1 + x^2)...(1 + x^9)\n\nSimplifying that, since x^0 is 1, it becomes:\n\nG(x) = (1 + 1)(1 + x)(1 + x^2)...(1 + x^9) = 2*(1 + x)(1 + x^2)...(1 + x^9)\n\nBut actually, since 0 is in the set, the generating function is correct as is. However, when we expand this, the coefficient of x^m will give the number of subsets (including the empty set) that sum to m. So, to find the number of non-empty subsets with sum divisible by 3, I need to compute the sum of coefficients of x^{3k} for all integers k, and then subtract 1 to exclude the empty set.\n\nBut calculating this directly seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way using roots of unity. I remember that for problems involving divisibility, using the roots of unity filter can help extract the coefficients corresponding to multiples of a certain number, in this case, 3.\n\nThe formula for the number of subsets with sum congruent to 0 mod 3 is:\n\n( G(1) + G(ω) + G(ω^2) ) / 3\n\nWhere ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity, i.e., ω = e^(2πi/3). This formula averages the generating function evaluated at the three roots of unity, which effectively picks out the coefficients where the exponent is divisible by 3.\n\nBut wait, G(1) is just the total number of subsets, including the empty set. Since our set has 10 elements, G(1) = 2^10 = 1024. So, the number of subsets (including empty) with sum divisible by 3 is (1024 + G(ω) + G(ω^2))/3. Then, since we need non-empty subsets, we'll subtract 1 at the end.\n\nSo, I need to compute G(ω) and G(ω^2). Let's compute G(ω):\n\nG(ω) = (1 + ω^0)(1 + ω^1)(1 + ω^2)...(1 + ω^9)\n\nBut ω^0 = 1, so that term is 2. The rest of the terms are (1 + ω^k) for k from 1 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, G(ω^2) = (1 + (ω^2)^0)(1 + (ω^2)^1)...(1 + (ω^2)^9) = same as G(ω) but with ω replaced by ω^2.\n\nSo, let's compute G(ω). Let's note that ω^3 = 1, so ω^k cycles every 3. So, for k from 1 to 9, ω^k cycles through ω, ω^2, 1, ω, ω^2, 1, etc.\n\nSo, let's group the terms in G(ω) by their exponents modulo 3.\n\nFirst, separate the terms based on k mod 3:\n\n- For k ≡ 0 mod 3: k = 3, 6, 9. So, terms are (1 + ω^3), (1 + ω^6), (1 + ω^9). But ω^3 = 1, so each of these terms is (1 + 1) = 2. There are 3 such terms, so the product is 2^3 = 8.\n\n- For k ≡ 1 mod 3: k = 1, 4, 7. Terms are (1 + ω), (1 + ω^4), (1 + ω^7). But ω^4 = ω^(3+1) = ω, and ω^7 = ω^(6+1) = ω. So, each term is (1 + ω). There are 3 such terms, so the product is (1 + ω)^3.\n\n- For k ≡ 2 mod 3: k = 2, 5, 8. Terms are (1 + ω^2), (1 + ω^5), (1 + ω^8). Similarly, ω^5 = ω^(3+2) = ω^2, and ω^8 = ω^(6+2) = ω^2. So, each term is (1 + ω^2). There are 3 such terms, so the product is (1 + ω^2)^3.\n\nTherefore, G(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3 * 8. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the initial term was (1 + ω^0) = 2, then the rest of the terms are grouped as above. So, actually, G(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The initial term is (1 + ω^0) = 2, and then for k=1 to 9, we have three groups: k=1,4,7; k=2,5,8; k=3,6,9. So, the product is 2 * [(1 + ω)(1 + ω^4)(1 + ω^7)] * [(1 + ω^2)(1 + ω^5)(1 + ω^8)] * [(1 + ω^3)(1 + ω^6)(1 + ω^9)].\n\nBut as I noted earlier, ω^3 = 1, so (1 + ω^3) = 2, same for the others. So, the product becomes 2 * [(1 + ω)^3] * [(1 + ω^2)^3] * [2^3]. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the first term is 2, then for k=1,4,7: each term is (1 + ω), so three terms: (1 + ω)^3. Similarly, for k=2,5,8: (1 + ω^2)^3. And for k=3,6,9: (1 + 1)^3 = 8. So, overall, G(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3 * 8.\n\nWait, that seems too large. Let me recast it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial term is 2, and then for k=1 to 9, we have three groups:\n\n- k=1,4,7: each (1 + ω), so product is (1 + ω)^3\n\n- k=2,5,8: each (1 + ω^2), so product is (1 + ω^2)^3\n\n- k=3,6,9: each (1 + 1), so product is 2^3 = 8\n\nTherefore, G(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3 * 8\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2 * 8 is 16, and then multiplied by the cubes. But let's compute (1 + ω) and (1 + ω^2) first.\n\nWe know that ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity, so 1 + ω + ω^2 = 0. Therefore, 1 + ω = -ω^2, and 1 + ω^2 = -ω.\n\nSo, (1 + ω) = -ω^2, and (1 + ω^2) = -ω.\n\nTherefore, (1 + ω)^3 = (-ω^2)^3 = (-1)^3 * (ω^2)^3 = -1 * (ω^6) = -1 * (ω^0) = -1, since ω^3 = 1, so ω^6 = (ω^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + ω^2)^3 = (-ω)^3 = (-1)^3 * ω^3 = -1 * 1 = -1.\n\nTherefore, G(ω) = 2 * (-1) * (-1) * 8 = 2 * 1 * 8 = 16.\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify:\n\nG(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3 * 8\n\nBut (1 + ω)^3 = (-ω^2)^3 = - (ω^6) = -1\n\nSimilarly, (1 + ω^2)^3 = (-ω)^3 = -1\n\nSo, G(ω) = 2 * (-1) * (-1) * 8 = 2 * 1 * 8 = 16\n\nWait, but 2 * 8 is 16, and then times (-1)*(-1) is 1, so 16*1=16.\n\nSimilarly, G(ω^2) would be the same, because ω^2 is also a primitive root, and the same reasoning applies. So, G(ω^2) = 16 as well.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets (including empty) with sum divisible by 3 is (G(1) + G(ω) + G(ω^2))/3 = (1024 + 16 + 16)/3 = (1024 + 32)/3 = 1056/3 = 352.\n\nBut remember, this includes the empty set. Since we need non-empty subsets, we subtract 1, so 352 - 1 = 351.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 351 seems a bit high. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, G(1) = 2^10 = 1024. Correct.\n\nG(ω) and G(ω^2) both equal 16. So, 1024 + 16 + 16 = 1056. Divided by 3 is 352. So, 352 subsets including the empty set. Therefore, non-empty subsets would be 352 - 1 = 351.\n\nBut let me think about the total number of subsets. 2^10 = 1024. The number of subsets with sum divisible by 3 is 352, which is exactly 1024 / 3 ≈ 341.333, but 352 is a bit higher. Hmm, that seems a bit off because the number should be roughly a third, but maybe it's exact.\n\nWait, 1024 divided by 3 is approximately 341.333, but 352 is 10 more. Hmm, maybe my calculation of G(ω) is wrong.\n\nLet me recalculate G(ω):\n\nG(ω) = (1 + 1)(1 + ω)(1 + ω^2)(1 + 1)(1 + ω)(1 + ω^2)(1 + 1)(1 + ω)(1 + ω^2)(1 + 1)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the generating function is the product from k=0 to 9 of (1 + x^k). So, for each k, we have (1 + x^k). So, when x = ω, it's (1 + ω^0)(1 + ω^1)...(1 + ω^9).\n\nBut ω^0 = 1, so that term is 2. Then, for k=1 to 9, we have (1 + ω^k). As before, group them by k mod 3.\n\nSo, k=1,4,7: each (1 + ω)\n\nk=2,5,8: each (1 + ω^2)\n\nk=3,6,9: each (1 + 1) = 2\n\nSo, G(ω) = 2 * [(1 + ω)^3] * [(1 + ω^2)^3] * [2^3]\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, G(ω) = 2 * (1 + ω)^3 * (1 + ω^2)^3 * 8\n\nBut (1 + ω) = -ω^2, so (1 + ω)^3 = (-ω^2)^3 = - (ω^6) = -1\n\nSimilarly, (1 + ω^2)^3 = (-ω)^3 = -1\n\nSo, G(ω) = 2 * (-1) * (-1) * 8 = 2 * 1 * 8 = 16\n\nSame as before. So, G(ω) = 16, G(ω^2) = 16.\n\nSo, the total is (1024 + 16 + 16)/3 = 1", "answer": "Vyjdeme z toho, že pri delení ľubovoľným kladným prirodzeným číslom je zvyšok súčtu niekoľkých celých čísel rovnaký ako zvyšok čísla, ktoré dostaneme sčítaním zvyškov jednotlivých sčítancov.\n\nPreto 10 zadaných čísel rozdelíme podľa ich zvyškov po delení 3 do troch množín  \n\n**A₀ = {0, 3, 6, 9},**  \n**A₁ = {1, 4, 7},**  \n**A₂ = {2, 5, 8}.**\n\nSčítance z A₀ nijako neovplyvňujú zvyšky skúmaných súčtov.

So, this case doesn't yield a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is \\(k = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, \\(k = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Now, let's find the relationship between \\(a, b, c\\).\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(a = k(b + c) = \\frac{1}{2}(b + c)\\)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: \\(b = \\frac{1}{2}(c + a)\\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(c = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b)\\)\n\nSo, all three variables are equal to half the sum of the other two. Let me see if this implies that \\(a = b = c\\).\n\nLet me assume \\(a = b = c\\). Then, substituting into the equations:\n\n\\(a = \\frac{1}{2}(a + a) = \\frac{1}{2}(2a) = a\\). So, it's consistent.\n\nBut is this the only solution? Let me check.\n\nSuppose \\(a = b = c\\). Then, the original condition is satisfied because each fraction becomes \\(\\frac{a}{2a} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so all equal.\n\nBut could there be another solution where \\(a, b, c\\) are not all equal?\n\nSuppose \\(a + b + c = 0\\). Let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, if \\(a + b + c = 0\\), then \\(b + c = -a\\), so \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}(b + c) = \\frac{1}{2}(-a)\\), so \\(a = -\\frac{1}{2}a\\), which implies \\(a = 0\\). Similarly, \\(b = 0\\), \\(c = 0\\). So, the only solution in this case is the trivial solution \\(a = b = c = 0\\), which is a trivial case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, \\(a, b, c\\) are real numbers, so they could be zero. But if all are zero, then the expression is undefined because the denominator becomes zero as well. So, we need to consider non-trivial solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only non-trivial solution is \\(a = b = c\\). So, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, if \\(a = b = c\\), then let's compute the expression.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n\\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3a^3\\)\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\((b + c)^3 + (c + a)^3 + (a + b)^3\\)\n\nSince \\(a = b = c\\), each term is \\((a + a)^3 = (2a)^3 = 8a^3\\). So, the denominator is \\(3 \\times 8a^3 = 24a^3\\).\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3a^3}{24a^3} = \\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nSo, the value is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nBut wait, is this the only possible value? Let me think.\n\nEarlier, I assumed \\(a = b = c\\), but is there another case where \\(a, b, c\\) are not equal but still satisfy the given condition?\n\nWait, when I solved for \\(k\\), I found that \\(k = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is the only solution, which led to \\(a = b = c\\). So, unless there's another solution where \\(a, b, c\\) are not equal, but still satisfy the condition, but from the equations, it seems that \\(a = b = c\\) is the only non-trivial solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case where \\(a + b + c = 0\\). Wait, earlier I thought that leads to all being zero, but let me verify.\n\nIf \\(a + b + c = 0\\), then \\(b + c = -a\\), so from the first equation:\n\n\\(a = k(b + c) = -k a\\)\n\nSo, \\(a = -k a\\), which implies \\(a(1 + k) = 0\\). So, either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(k = -1\\).\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n\\(b = k(c + a)\\). Since \\(c + a = -b\\), so \\(b = -k b\\), which implies \\(b(1 + k) = 0\\).\n\nSame for the third equation: \\(c = k(a + b) = -k c\\), so \\(c(1 + k) = 0\\).\n\nSo, either \\(1 + k = 0\\) (i.e., \\(k = -1\\)) or \\(a = b = c = 0\\).\n\nBut earlier, when I considered \\(k = -1\\), it led to a contradiction, so only \\(k = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is valid.\n\nWait, but if \\(k = -1\\), let's see:\n\nIf \\(k = -1\\), then from equation 1: \\(a = -1(b + c)\\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(b = -1(c + a)\\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(c = -1(a + b)\\)\n\nSo, substituting equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n\\(b = -1(c + (-b - c)) = -1(-b) = b\\)\n\nSo, \\(b = b\\), which is always true.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: \\(c = -1(a + b) = -1((-b - c) + b) = -1(-c) = c\\)\n\nSo, \\(c = c\\), which is also always true.\n\nSo, in this case, the equations are consistent, but we have \\(a = -b - c\\), \\(b = -c - a\\), \\(c = -a - b\\). So, this is a system where each variable is the negative sum of the other two.\n\nBut if \\(a = -b - c\\), then \\(a + b + c = 0\\). So, in this case, \\(a + b + c = 0\\), but \\(a, b, c\\) are not necessarily zero.\n\nSo, in this case, \\(a + b + c = 0\\), but \\(a, b, c\\) can be non-zero.\n\nSo, in this case, let's compute the expression.\n\nNumerator: \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\\)\n\nDenominator: \\((b + c)^3 + (c + a)^3 + (a + b)^3\\)\n\nBut since \\(a + b + c = 0\\), we can use the identity:\n\n\\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc\\)\n\nSimilarly, in the denominator, each term is \\((b + c)^3 = (-a)^3 = -a^3\\), same for others.\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n\\(-a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = -(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = -3abc\\)\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3abc}{-3abc} = -1\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, the expression is \\(-1\\).\n\nBut wait, earlier, when \\(k = -1\\), we had a contradiction when trying to solve for \\(c\\). Let me check that again.\n\nEarlier, when I set \\(k = -1\\), I had:\n\nFrom equation (4): \\(b(1 - (-1)^2) = c(-1 + (-1)^2)\\)\n\nWhich is \\(b(1 - 1) = c(-1 + 1)\\), so \\(0 = 0\\). So, no information.\n\nSimilarly, equation (5): \\(c(1 - 1) = b(-1 + 1)\\), which is also \\(0 = 0\\). So, no contradiction, but we have \\(a + b + c = 0\\), but \\(a, b, c\\) can be non-zero.\n\nSo, in this case, the expression is \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\n1. \\(a = b = c\\), leading to the expression being \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n2. \\(a + b + c = 0\\), leading to the expression being \\(-1\\)\n\nBut wait, in the first case, \\(a = b = c\\), but if \\(a = b = c = 0\\), then the expression is undefined. So, we need to ensure that \\(a, b, c\\) are not all zero.\n\nSo, in the first case, \\(a = b = c \\neq 0\\), leading to the expression \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nIn the second case, \\(a + b + c = 0\\), but \\(a, b, c\\) are not all zero, leading to the expression \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible values are \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) and \\(-1\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if both cases are possible.\n\nCase 1: \\(a = b = c \\neq 0\\). Then, the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nCase 2: \\(a + b + c = 0\\), but \\(a, b, c\\) are not all zero. Then, the expression is \\(-1\\).\n\nSo, both values are possible.\n\nBut let me test with specific numbers.\n\nFirst, test case 1: Let \\(a = b = c = 1\\).\n\nThen, numerator: \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3", "answer": "**Označme** \\(k\\) **spoločnú hodnotu zadaných troch zlomkov.

The condition is that each number in the quintuple must divide the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nStarting with part a): (a, a, a, a, b). So, we have four a's and one b, all positive integers, and a ≠ b. The condition is that each number divides the sum of any three of the other four. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the role of a and b. Since there are four a's, each a must divide the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers. Similarly, b must divide the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers, which in this case are all a's except one.\n\nLet me write down the conditions mathematically. For each a, the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers is S_a = a + a + a + b. Wait, no, actually, if we take any three of the remaining four, which are three a's and one b, so the sum would be 3a + b. Therefore, each a must divide 3a + b. Similarly, for b, the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers would be 3a + a, since we exclude b and take three a's. So, b must divide 4a.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. For each a: a divides (3a + b) ⇒ 3a + b is divisible by a ⇒ b must be divisible by a, because 3a is already divisible by a. So, b = k * a, where k is some positive integer.\n\n2. For b: b divides 4a. Since b = k * a, then k * a divides 4a ⇒ k divides 4. So, k can be 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut wait, a and b are different, so k cannot be 1 because that would make a = b. So, k can be 2 or 4.\n\nLet's consider k=2 first. Then b = 2a. Now, let's check the conditions again.\n\nEach a must divide 3a + b = 3a + 2a = 5a. Since 5a is divisible by a, that's fine. Now, b must divide 4a. Since b=2a, 2a divides 4a, which is true because 4a / 2a = 2, an integer.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy the conditions. Let's pick a specific example to test. Let a=1, then b=2. The quintuple is (1,1,1,1,2). Let's check each number:\n\n- For each 1: sum of any three others is 1+1+2 = 4, which is divisible by 1. Good.\n- For 2: sum of any three others is 1+1+1 = 3, which is not divisible by 2. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so 2 does not divide 3. That means our initial assumption might be flawed. Maybe k=2 doesn't work because when we take the sum of three a's, which is 3a, and b divides that. But in this case, 2 divides 3? No, 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, which is not an integer. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so maybe k=2 doesn't work. Let's try k=4. Then b=4a. Let's test this.\n\nEach a must divide 3a + b = 3a + 4a = 7a. Since 7a is divisible by a, that's fine. Now, b must divide 4a. Since b=4a, 4a divides 4a, which is true.\n\nNow, let's test with a=1, b=4. The quintuple is (1,1,1,1,4). Checking each number:\n\n- For each 1: sum of any three others is 1+1+4 = 6, which is divisible by 1. Good.\n- For 4: sum of any three others is 1+1+1 = 3, which is not divisible by 4. Again, a problem.\n\nSo, 4 doesn't divide 3. Hmm, same issue. So, regardless of k=2 or k=4, the sum of three a's is 3a, and b must divide 3a. But in our earlier reasoning, we thought b divides 4a, but actually, when considering the sum of three a's, which is 3a, b must divide 3a.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me correct that. When considering the condition for b, the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers is 3a, because we exclude b and take three a's. So, b must divide 3a, not 4a. That was a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\n1. For each a: a divides (3a + b) ⇒ 3a + b is divisible by a ⇒ b must be divisible by a. So, b = k * a.\n\n2. For b: b divides 3a. Since b = k * a, then k * a divides 3a ⇒ k divides 3. So, k can be 1, 3.\n\nBut since a ≠ b, k cannot be 1. So, k=3. Therefore, b=3a.\n\nLet's test this. Let a=1, b=3. Quintuple is (1,1,1,1,3).\n\nCheck each number:\n\n- For each 1: sum of any three others is 1+1+3 = 5, which is divisible by 1. Good.\n- For 3: sum of any three others is 1+1+1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Perfect.\n\nSo, this works! Therefore, for part a), such a quintuple exists. For example, (1,1,1,1,3) satisfies all conditions.\n\nNow, moving on to part b): (a, a, b, b, c), where a, b, c are all different. The condition is similar: each number must divide the sum of any three of the remaining four.\n\nThis seems more complex because now we have two pairs and one single. Let's denote the quintuple as (a, a, b, b, c), with a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a.\n\nWe need to ensure that each a, b, and c divides the sum of any three of the other four.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. For each a: the sum of any three of the remaining four numbers. The remaining four are a, b, b, c. So, the sum can be:\n\n   - a + b + b = a + 2b\n   - a + b + c\n   - b + b + c = 2b + c\n\n   So, each a must divide all three sums: a + 2b, a + b + c, and 2b + c.\n\n2. Similarly, for each b: the remaining four numbers are a, a, b, c. The sum of any three can be:\n\n   - a + a + b = 2a + b\n   - a + a + c = 2a + c\n   - a + b + c\n\n   So, each b must divide 2a + b, 2a + c, and a + b + c.\n\n3. For c: the remaining four numbers are a, a, b, b. The sum of any three can be:\n\n   - a + a + b = 2a + b\n   - a + a + b = 2a + b\n   - a + b + b = a + 2b\n\n   So, c must divide 2a + b and a + 2b.\n\nThis is a lot of conditions. Let's try to write them mathematically.\n\nStarting with the a's:\n\n- a divides (a + 2b) ⇒ a divides 2b ⇒ 2b = m * a, where m is an integer.\n- a divides (a + b + c) ⇒ a divides (b + c) ⇒ b + c = n * a, where n is an integer.\n- a divides (2b + c) ⇒ 2b + c = p * a, where p is an integer.\n\nSimilarly, for the b's:\n\n- b divides (2a + b) ⇒ b divides 2a ⇒ 2a = q * b, where q is an integer.\n- b divides (2a + c) ⇒ 2a + c = r * b, where r is an integer.\n- b divides (a + b + c) ⇒ b divides (a + c) ⇒ a + c = s * b, where s is an integer.\n\nFor c:\n\n- c divides (2a + b) ⇒ 2a + b = t * c, where t is an integer.\n- c divides (a + 2b) ⇒ a + 2b = u * c, where u is an integer.\n\nSo, now we have a system of equations:\n\nFrom a's:\n1. 2b = m * a\n2. b + c = n * a\n3. 2b + c = p * a\n\nFrom b's:\n4. 2a = q * b\n5. 2a + c = r * b\n6. a + c = s * b\n\nFrom c:\n7. 2a + b = t * c\n8. a + 2b = u * c\n\nThis is a system of 8 equations with variables a, b, c, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u. It's quite complex, but maybe we can find relationships between a, b, c.\n\nLet me see if I can express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2b = m * a ⇒ b = (m/2) * a. Since b must be an integer, m must be even. Let m = 2k, so b = k * a.\n\nFrom equation 4: 2a = q * b. But b = k * a, so 2a = q * k * a ⇒ 2 = q * k. Since q and k are positive integers, possible pairs (q, k) are (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nCase 1: q=1, k=2. Then b = 2a.\n\nCase 2: q=2, k=1. Then b = a.\n\nBut b cannot be equal to a, so Case 2 is invalid. Therefore, only Case 1 is possible: q=1, k=2, so b=2a.\n\nSo, b=2a.\n\nNow, let's substitute b=2a into other equations.\n\nFrom equation 2: b + c = n * a ⇒ 2a + c = n * a ⇒ c = (n - 2) * a.\n\nFrom equation 3: 2b + c = p * a ⇒ 4a + c = p * a ⇒ c = (p - 4) * a.\n\nBut from equation 2, c = (n - 2) * a, so (n - 2) * a = (p - 4) * a ⇒ n - 2 = p - 4 ⇒ p = n + 2.\n\nFrom equation 5: 2a + c = r * b ⇒ 2a + c = r * 2a ⇒ c = (2r - 2) * a.\n\nFrom equation 6: a + c = s * b ⇒ a + c = s * 2a ⇒ c = (2s - 1) * a.\n\nFrom equation 7: 2a + b = t * c ⇒ 2a + 2a = t * c ⇒ 4a = t * c ⇒ c = (4 / t) * a.\n\nFrom equation 8: a + 2b = u * c ⇒ a + 4a = u * c ⇒ 5a = u * c ⇒ c = (5 / u) * a.\n\nSo, now we have multiple expressions for c in terms of a:\n\n1. c = (n - 2) * a\n2. c = (p - 4) * a\n3. c = (2r - 2) * a\n4. c = (2s - 1) * a\n5. c = (4 / t) * a\n6. c = (5 / u) * a\n\nSince all these expressions equal c, they must be equal to each other. Let's set them equal pairwise.\n\nFrom 1 and 5: (n - 2) * a = (4 / t) * a ⇒ n - 2 = 4 / t. Since n and t are integers, 4 must be divisible by t. So, t can be 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, from 1 and 6: (n - 2) * a = (5 / u) * a ⇒ n - 2 = 5 / u. So, u must divide 5. Therefore, u can be 1 or 5.\n\nLet's consider possible values for t and u.\n\nCase 1: t=1. Then from 1 and 5: n - 2 = 4 / 1 = 4 ⇒ n=6.\n\nFrom 1 and 6: n - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 6 - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 4 = 5 / u ⇒ u = 5 / 4. Not an integer, so invalid.\n\nCase 2: t=2. Then from 1 and 5: n - 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 ⇒ n=4.\n\nFrom 1 and 6: n - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 4 - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 2 = 5 / u ⇒ u=5/2. Not integer, invalid.\n\nCase 3: t=4. Then from 1 and 5: n - 2 = 4 / 4 = 1 ⇒ n=3.\n\nFrom 1 and 6: n - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 3 - 2 = 5 / u ⇒ 1 = 5 / u ⇒ u=5.\n\nSo, t=4, u=5, n=3.\n\nNow, let's check other equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: c = (p - 4) * a. But p = n + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So, c = (5 - 4) * a = a.\n\nBut c = a, which contradicts the condition that a, b", "answer": "#### Part a)\n**Najskôr určíme, ktoré deliteľnosti majú platiť.**  \nV zadanej pätici **(a, a, a, a, b)** sú dve rôzne čísla **a a b**.

The condition is that in each row and each column, there should be a number whose 7-n multiple equals the sum of the other three numbers in that row or column. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the requirement clearly. For each row and each column, one of the four numbers must satisfy the equation: 7 * a = b + c + d, where a, b, c, d are the numbers in that row or column, and all are distinct and range from 1 to 16.\n\nSo, for each row and column, one number is 7 times the sum of the other three. That means, for example, if a number is 7 times another, it has to be a multiple of 7. Since we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 16, the possible multiples of 7 are 7 and 14. So, in each row and column, either 7 or 14 must be the number that is 7 times the sum of the other three.\n\nWait, but 7 is 7 times 1, and 14 is 7 times 2. So, in each row and column, the number that is 7 times the sum of the other three must be either 7 or 14. That simplifies things a bit because we only have two candidates for that special number in each row and column.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications. If in a row, the special number is 7, then the sum of the other three numbers must be 1 (since 7 = 7*1). But wait, the numbers have to be distinct and from 1 to 16. The smallest three distinct numbers are 1, 2, and 3, which sum to 6. That's already more than 1. So, it's impossible for 7 to be the special number in any row or column because the sum of the other three numbers would have to be 1, which isn't possible with distinct natural numbers starting from 1.\n\nTherefore, the special number in each row and column must be 14. That means, in every row and every column, 14 must be the number that is 7 times the sum of the other three. So, 14 = 7*(sum of the other three), which implies that the sum of the other three numbers must be 2 (since 14/7 = 2). \n\nBut again, the smallest three distinct numbers are 1, 2, and 3, which sum to 6. That's way more than 2. So, this seems impossible as well. Wait, am I missing something here?\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. It says that in each row and each column, there exists a number such that 7 times that number equals the sum of the other three. So, it's not necessarily that the special number is 7 or 14, but rather that 7 times some number equals the sum of the other three. So, the special number could be any number from 1 to 16, as long as 7 times that number equals the sum of the other three.\n\nSo, let's rephrase: For each row and column, there exists a number 'a' such that 7a = sum of the other three numbers in that row or column. Therefore, 'a' can be any number from 1 to 16, but 7a must be equal to the sum of the other three.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the possible values of 'a' and see what the sum of the other three numbers would have to be.\n\nFor a = 1: 7*1 = 7. So, the sum of the other three numbers must be 7. The smallest three distinct numbers are 1, 2, 3, which sum to 6. So, 7 is possible if the other three numbers are 1, 2, and 4 (sum is 7). But wait, if a=1, then the other numbers would have to include 1, but since all numbers must be distinct, and a=1 is already used, the other numbers can't include 1 again. So, the smallest sum would be 2+3+4=9, which is greater than 7. Therefore, a=1 is impossible.\n\nFor a=2: 7*2=14. So, the sum of the other three numbers must be 14. The smallest three distinct numbers excluding 2 would be 1, 3, 4, which sum to 8. The largest possible sum with three distinct numbers less than 16 is 13+14+15=42, but we need exactly 14. Let's see if it's possible. For example, 1+5+8=14, or 2+4+8=14, but 2 is already 'a', so we can't use it again. So, 1+5+8=14. That works. So, a=2 is possible.\n\nFor a=3: 7*3=21. The sum of the other three numbers must be 21. The smallest three distinct numbers excluding 3 would be 1,2,4, which sum to 7. The largest possible sum is 13+14+15=42. So, 21 is achievable. For example, 4+7+10=21, but 7 is not excluded yet. Wait, but we need to make sure that all numbers are distinct and within 1-16, excluding 'a'=3. So, 1+8+12=21, or 2+7+12=21, etc. So, yes, it's possible.\n\nFor a=4: 7*4=28. The sum of the other three numbers must be 28. The smallest three distinct numbers excluding 4 would be 1,2,3, which sum to 6. The largest possible sum is 13+14+15=42. So, 28 is achievable. For example, 5+9+14=28, or 6+8+14=28, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for a=5: 7*5=35. The sum of the other three numbers must be 35. The smallest three distinct numbers excluding 5 would be 1,2,3, summing to 6. The largest possible sum is 13+14+15=42. So, 35 is achievable. For example, 6+9+20=35, but 20 is beyond 16. So, need to find three numbers between 1-16, excluding 5, that sum to 35. Let's see: 13+14+8=35. Yes, that works.\n\na=6: 7*6=42. The sum of the other three numbers must be 42. The maximum sum of three distinct numbers from 1-16 is 13+14+15=42. So, the only way is 13+14+15=42. Therefore, a=6 can only be achieved if the other three numbers are 13,14,15. But since all numbers must be distinct, and we're using 6 as 'a', that's possible.\n\na=7: 7*7=49. The sum of the other three numbers must be 49. But the maximum sum is 13+14+15=42, which is less than 49. So, a=7 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, a=8: 7*8=56. The sum of the other three numbers must be 56, which is way beyond the maximum possible sum of 42. So, a=8 and above are impossible.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for 'a' in each row and column are 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo, in each row and column, the special number 'a' must be one of 2,3,4,5,6, and the sum of the other three numbers must be 7a.\n\nNow, considering that, let's think about the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 16. The sum is (16*17)/2 = 136.\n\nIn each row, the sum of the four numbers is equal to a + (sum of the other three) = a + 7a = 8a. So, each row's total is 8a, where a is one of 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, each column's total is 8a, where a is one of 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of all rows would be the sum of four row totals, each being 8a_i, where a_i is the special number for that row. Similarly, the total sum of all columns would be the sum of four column totals, each being 8a_j, where a_j is the special number for that column.\n\nBut the total sum of the table is 136, so the sum of the row totals must be 136, and the sum of the column totals must also be 136.\n\nTherefore, sum of four row totals = 8*(a1 + a2 + a3 + a4) = 136. So, a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = 136 / 8 = 17.\n\nSimilarly, sum of four column totals = 8*(b1 + b2 + b3 + b4) = 136, so b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 = 17.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the special numbers in the rows must be 17, and the sum of the special numbers in the columns must also be 17.\n\nNow, the special numbers in the rows and columns are each from the set {2,3,4,5,6}. We need to choose four numbers from this set (with possible repeats, but since all numbers in the table are distinct, the special numbers must also be distinct because if two rows had the same special number, say 2, then the sum of the other three numbers in both rows would be 14, but the numbers in the table are distinct, so the other numbers would have to be different. Wait, actually, the special numbers can be the same, but the other numbers would have to be different. Hmm, but since all numbers in the table are distinct, the special numbers can be the same only if the other numbers compensate, but it's complicated. Maybe it's better to assume that the special numbers are distinct. Let's see.\n\nBut let's proceed. We need four numbers from {2,3,4,5,6} that add up to 17. Let's find all possible combinations.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- 2,3,5,7: But 7 is not in the set.\n\nWait, the set is {2,3,4,5,6}. So, let's find four distinct numbers from this set that add up to 17.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. 2,3,4,8: 8 is not in the set.\n\n2. 2,3,5,7: 7 not in set.\n\n3. 2,3,6,6: Repeats, not allowed.\n\n4. 2,4,5,6: 2+4+5+6=17. Yes, that works.\n\n5. 3,4,5,5: Repeats, not allowed.\n\n6. 2,3,4,8: Not possible.\n\n7. 2,3,5,7: Not possible.\n\n8. 2,4,5,6: As above.\n\n9. 3,4,5,5: Not possible.\n\n10. 3,4,5,5: Same.\n\n11. 3,4,5,5: Same.\n\nSo, the only combination of four distinct numbers from {2,3,4,5,6} that add up to 17 is 2,4,5,6.\n\nTherefore, the special numbers in the rows must be 2,4,5,6 in some order, and similarly for the columns.\n\nSo, each row must have one of these special numbers, and each column must have one of these special numbers.\n\nNow, let's think about how to arrange these special numbers in the grid.\n\nWe have four rows, each with a special number of 2,4,5,6. Similarly, four columns, each with a special number of 2,4,5,6.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the numbers in the grid are all distinct and from 1 to 16.\n\nMoreover, for each row, the sum of the other three numbers is 7 times the special number.\n\nSimilarly, for each column.\n\nThis seems complex, but let's try to construct such a grid.\n\nFirst, let's assign the special numbers to the rows and columns.\n\nLet's say the rows have special numbers 2,4,5,6 in some order, and the columns also have 2,4,5,6 in some order.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the numbers don't conflict.\n\nLet me try to assign the special numbers to rows and columns in a way that allows the rest of the numbers to fit.\n\nLet's start by assigning the special number 2 to a row. Then, the sum of the other three numbers in that row must be 14 (since 7*2=14). So, we need three distinct numbers from 1-16, excluding 2, that sum to 14.\n\nPossible triplets:\n\n- 1,3,10: 1+3+10=14\n\n- 1,4,9: 1+4+9=14\n\n- 1,5,8: 1+5+8=14\n\n- 1,6,7: 1+6+7=14\n\n- 2,3,9: But 2 is already used as the special number.\n\n- 2,4,8: Same issue.\n\n- 3,4,7: 3+4+7=14\n\n- 3,5,6: 3+5+6=14\n\nSo, there are multiple options. Let's pick one. Let's say we choose 1,3,10 for the row with special number 2.\n\nSo, the row would be [2,1,3,10]. But wait, 1,3,10 are distinct and not equal to 2. That works.\n\nNow, let's assign the special number 6 to a column. The sum of the other three numbers in that column must be 42 (since ", "answer": "Dokážeme sporom, že to nie je možné.\n\nPredpokladajme, že taká vyhovujúca tabuľka existuje.

Similarly, when a brother says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" he's talking about his brothers, including himself or not? Hmm, that's a good question.\n\nWait, actually, when someone says \"Mám práve X sestru,\" that would mean they have X sisters. But since they are male, they can't be their own sister, so the number of sisters is X. Similarly, when a brother says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" that would mean they have Y brothers. But again, since they are male, they can't be their own brother, so the number of brothers is Y. But wait, does that include themselves? Hmm, no, because when you count brothers, you don't include yourself. So, if a brother says he has Y brothers, that means he has Y brothers besides himself, so the total number of brothers in the family would be Y + 1 (including himself). Similarly, the number of sisters would be X, as he's not counting himself.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If a brother says \"Mám práve X sestru,\" that means he has X sisters. Since he's male, the number of sisters is X. Similarly, if he says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" that means he has Y brothers besides himself, so the total number of brothers is Y + 1. But wait, that can't be right because if he's a brother, he's part of the brothers, so the total number of brothers would be Y + 1, including himself. But when he says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" he's talking about his brothers, not including himself. So, the total number of brothers is Y, and the total number of sisters is X.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. If a brother says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" that means he has Y brothers. But since he is a brother, the total number of brothers in the family would be Y + 1 (including himself). Similarly, if he says \"Mám práve X sestru,\" that means he has X sisters, and since he's male, the number of sisters is X.\n\nBut wait, this seems conflicting because if each brother is making a statement about the number of sisters and brothers, but each brother is male, so the number of brothers would be Y + 1, and the number of sisters would be X. But if all four brothers are telling the truth, then each of them must have the same number of sisters and brothers, right? Because they are all part of the same family.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Each brother could have a different number of sisters and brothers, but in reality, the family has a fixed number of brothers and sisters. So, if all four brothers are telling the truth, their statements must be consistent with each other. That is, the number of sisters and brothers they each state must match the actual numbers in the family.\n\nBut wait, each brother is making two statements: one about sisters and one about brothers. But the problem says each of the four brothers has made a statement. Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Každý zo štyroch vlastných súrodencov vyslovil iný z týchto 20 výrokov.\" So, each of the four brothers made one of the 20 statements. So, each brother made either a statement about sisters or brothers, but not both. So, each brother made one statement, either about the number of sisters or the number of brothers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"iný z týchto 20 výrokov,\" which are 20 different statements, each specifying a number from 1 to 10 for either sisters or brothers. So, each brother made one statement, either about sisters or brothers, but not both. So, each brother made one of the 20 statements, and all four brothers made different statements. So, each of the four brothers made a unique statement from the 20, either about sisters or brothers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"iný z týchto 20 výrokov,\" which are 20 different statements. So, each brother made one unique statement, so four unique statements out of 20. So, the four brothers made four different statements, each about either sisters or brothers, with numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nBut the question is, can all four brothers be telling the truth? So, is it possible that each of their statements is true, given that they are all part of the same family.\n\nSo, let's think about this. Let's denote the actual number of sisters as S and the actual number of brothers as B. Note that the brothers are part of the family, so B includes themselves. So, the total number of brothers is B, and the total number of sisters is S.\n\nEach brother, when making a statement, is either saying \"Mám práve X sestru.\" which would mean S = X, or \"Mám práve Y bratov.\" which would mean B = Y + 1, because they are not counting themselves.\n\nWait, no. If a brother says \"Mám práve Y bratov,\" that means he has Y brothers besides himself, so the total number of brothers is Y + 1. Similarly, if a sister says \"Mám práve X sestru,\" that would mean she has X sisters besides herself, so total sisters would be X + 1. But in this case, all statements are made by brothers, so we don't have to consider sisters' statements.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each of the four brothers made a statement, so all four statements are about brothers or sisters. But since they are brothers, their statements about sisters would be about their sisters, and their statements about brothers would be about their brothers.\n\nBut if all four brothers are telling the truth, then each of their statements must be consistent with the actual numbers S and B.\n\nSo, let's suppose that each brother made a statement about the number of sisters or brothers. Let's say some brothers said \"Mám práve X sestru.\" which would mean S = X, and others said \"Mám práve Y bratov.\" which would mean B = Y + 1, because they are not counting themselves.\n\nBut since all four brothers are telling the truth, the actual numbers S and B must satisfy all these statements. So, for example, if two brothers said \"Mám práve 2 sestru.\" then S would have to be 2, but since they are brothers, they can't be sisters, so S = 2. Similarly, if another brother said \"Mám práve 3 bratov.\" then B would be 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nBut wait, if two brothers both say \"Mám práve 2 sestru.\" then that would mean S = 2, but each brother is making a statement about the number of sisters, which is the same for all brothers. So, if all four brothers are telling the truth, then all their statements about sisters must agree, and all their statements about brothers must agree.\n\nWait, but the problem says each brother made a different statement, so each brother made a unique statement from the 20. So, each brother's statement is unique, either about a different number of sisters or brothers.\n\nWait, but if all four brothers are telling the truth, then their statements must all be consistent with the actual numbers S and B. So, for example, if one brother says \"Mám práve 3 sestru.\" then S = 3. Another brother says \"Mám práve 5 bratov.\" then B = 5 + 1 = 6. Another says \"Mám práve 2 sestru.\" which would conflict because S is already 3. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, so if all four brothers are telling the truth, then all their statements about sisters must agree on S, and all their statements about brothers must agree on B. But since each brother made a unique statement, they can't all be about the same number. So, for example, if two brothers say different numbers about sisters, then S would have to be both numbers, which is impossible. Therefore, it's impossible for all four brothers to be telling the truth because their statements would contradict each other.\n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe not all brothers are making statements about sisters or brothers. Maybe some are making statements about sisters and others about brothers. But if a brother is making a statement about sisters, then S is fixed, and if another brother is making a statement about brothers, then B is fixed. But if all four brothers are making statements, some about sisters and some about brothers, then S and B would have to satisfy all those statements. But since each statement is unique, S and B would have to be equal to all those numbers, which is impossible unless all the statements about sisters are the same and all the statements about brothers are the same.\n\nBut the problem says each brother made a different statement, so they can't all be about the same number. Therefore, it's impossible for all four brothers to be telling the truth because their statements would require S and B to be multiple different values simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose that among the four brothers, some are making statements about sisters and others about brothers. For example, two brothers say \"Mám práve 2 sestru.\" and \"Mám práve 3 sestru.\" which would require S to be both 2 and 3, which is impossible. Similarly, if one brother says \"Mám práve 4 sestru.\" and another says \"Mám práve 5 bratov.\" then S = 4 and B = 5 + 1 = 6. But then another brother could say \"Mám práve 4 sestru.\" which is consistent, but then we have two brothers saying the same statement, which is not allowed because each brother must make a unique statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says each of the four brothers made a different statement, so each statement is unique. Therefore, if one brother says S = 2, another says S = 3, which would require S to be both 2 and 3, which is impossible. Similarly, if one brother says B = 5, another says B = 6, which would require B to be both 5 and 6, which is impossible. Therefore, it's impossible for all four brothers to be telling the truth because their statements would require the number of sisters and brothers to be multiple different values at the same time, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe not all brothers are making statements about both sisters and brothers. Maybe some are making statements about sisters and others about brothers. But in that case, the number of sisters would have to be equal to all the statements about sisters, and the number of brothers would have to be equal to all the statements about brothers. But since each brother made a unique statement, the number of sisters would have to be equal to multiple different numbers, which is impossible. Similarly for brothers.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that it's impossible for all four brothers to be telling the truth because their statements would require the number of sisters and brothers to be multiple different values simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Suppose that two brothers are making statements about sisters, say S = 2 and S = 3, which is impossible. Similarly, if two brothers are making statements about brothers, B = 4 and B = 5, which is also impossible. Therefore, it's impossible for all four brothers to be telling the truth.\n\nSo, for part a), the answer is no, it's not possible.\n\nNow, moving on to part b). We need to find the largest natural number n such that each of the n brothers can make a unique statement from the 20, and all those statements are true.\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum n where n brothers can each make a unique statement about the number of sisters or brothers, and all those statements are consistent with some actual numbers S and B.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the largest n where we can have n unique statements (either about sisters or brothers) that are all true for some S and B.\n\nEach statement is either \"Mám práve X sestru.\" which means S = X, or \"Mám práve Y bratov.\" which means B = Y + 1.\n\nSo, for each statement, we have either S = X or B = Y + 1.\n\nNow, we need to choose n unique statements such that there exists some S and B where all those statements are true.\n\nSo, for example, if we choose statements about sisters, say S = 1, S = 2, ..., up to S = n, then S must be equal to all those numbers, which is impossible unless n = 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose statements about brothers, say B = 2, B = 3, ..., up to B = n + 1, then B must be equal to all those numbers, which is impossible unless n = 1.\n\nBut if we mix statements about sisters and brothers, then S and B can be different numbers, and we can have multiple statements that are consistent.\n\nFor example, suppose we have one brother saying S = 2, another saying B = 4. Then, S = 2 and B = 4. That works because S = 2 and B = 4 are consistent. Similarly, we can have another brother saying S = 3, which would require S = 3, but that conflicts with S = 2. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so if we have a brother saying S = 2 and another saying S = 3, that's impossible because S can't be both 2 and 3. Similarly, if we have a brother saying B = 4 and another saying B = 5, that's impossible because B can't be both 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, to have multiple brothers making true statements, we need to have all the statements about sisters to agree on S, and all the statements about brothers to agree on B. But since each brother must make a unique statement, we can have at most one statement about sisters and one statement about brothers,", "answer": "**a)**  \nÁno, je to možné.

", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of ordered quadruples of positive integers (a, b, c, d) such that their sum is 100, and they satisfy the equation \\( (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d) \\). Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. I need to find all ordered quadruples (a, b, c, d) where each of a, b, c, d is a positive integer, their sum is 100, and they satisfy the given equation. The equation has two parts: \\( (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) \\) and \\( (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d) \\). So, all three expressions are equal.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c + d = 100. Since all are positive integers, each of a, b, c, d is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's look at the equations:\n\n1. \\( (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) \\)\n2. \\( (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d) \\)\n\nSince all three are equal, let's set them all equal to some common value, say K. So,\n\n\\( (a + b)(c + d) = K \\)\n\\( (b + c)(a + d) = K \\)\n\\( (a + c)(b + d) = K \\)\n\nSo, all three expressions equal K. Let me write these equations out:\n\n1. \\( (a + b)(c + d) = K \\)\n2. \\( (b + c)(a + d) = K \\)\n3. \\( (a + c)(b + d) = K \\)\n\nSince all three are equal to K, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) \\)\nand\n\\( (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d) \\)\n\nLet me first work with the first equality:\n\n\\( (a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d) \\)\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( a c + a d + b c + b d \\)\nRight side: \\( b a + b d + c a + c d \\)\n\nSo, expanding both sides:\n\nLeft: \\( a c + a d + b c + b d \\)\nRight: \\( a b + b d + a c + c d \\)\n\nNow, subtract the right side from the left side:\n\n\\( (a c + a d + b c + b d) - (a b + b d + a c + c d) = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- a c cancels with -a c\n- a d remains\n- b c remains\n- b d cancels with -b d\n- -a b remains\n- -c d remains\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( a d + b c - a b - c d = 0 \\)\n\nLet me factor this expression:\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\( a d - a b + b c - c d = 0 \\)\n\nFactor a from the first two terms and c from the last two:\n\n\\( a(d - b) + c(b - d) = 0 \\)\n\nNotice that \\( (d - b) = -(b - d) \\), so:\n\n\\( a(d - b) - c(d - b) = 0 \\)\n\nFactor out \\( (d - b) \\):\n\n\\( (d - b)(a - c) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, either \\( d - b = 0 \\) or \\( a - c = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, either d = b or a = c.\n\nSimilarly, let's take the second equality:\n\n\\( (b + c)(a + d) = (a + c)(b + d) \\)\n\nAgain, expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( b a + b d + c a + c d \\)\nRight side: \\( a b + a d + c b + c d \\)\n\nSubtract right side from left side:\n\n\\( (b a + b d + c a + c d) - (a b + a d + c b + c d) = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- b a cancels with -a b\n- b d remains\n- c a remains\n- c d cancels with -c d\n- -a d remains\n- -c b remains\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( b d + c a - a d - c b = 0 \\)\n\nFactor this expression:\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\( b d - a d + c a - c b = 0 \\)\n\nFactor d from the first two terms and c from the last two:\n\n\\( d(b - a) + c(a - b) = 0 \\)\n\nNotice that \\( (a - b) = -(b - a) \\), so:\n\n\\( d(b - a) - c(b - a) = 0 \\)\n\nFactor out \\( (b - a) \\):\n\n\\( (b - a)(d - c) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, either \\( b - a = 0 \\) or \\( d - c = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, either b = a or d = c.\n\nSo, from the first equality, we have either d = b or a = c.\n\nFrom the second equality, we have either b = a or d = c.\n\nSo, let's consider the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: d = b and b = a.\n\nIf d = b and b = a, then a = b = d.\n\nCase 2: d = b and d = c.\n\nIf d = b and d = c, then b = c = d.\n\nCase 3: a = c and b = a.\n\nIf a = c and b = a, then a = b = c.\n\nCase 4: a = c and d = c.\n\nIf a = c and d = c, then a = c = d.\n\nWait, but let's see if these cases are distinct or overlapping.\n\nCase 1: a = b = d.\n\nCase 2: b = c = d.\n\nCase 3: a = b = c.\n\nCase 4: a = c = d.\n\nSo, these are four cases, but some might be similar.\n\nWait, actually, in each case, we have three variables equal.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nCase 1: a = b = d.\n\nThen, since a + b + c + d = 100, we have 3a + c = 100.\n\nBut in this case, from the first equality, d = b, so a = b = d, and c is different.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2: b = c = d, so 3b + a = 100.\n\nCase 3: a = b = c, so 3a + d = 100.\n\nCase 4: a = c = d, so 3a + b = 100.\n\nSo, each case corresponds to three variables being equal, and the fourth being different.\n\nBut wait, in each case, the fourth variable is different, but in the first case, it's c, in the second case, it's a, in the third case, it's d, and in the fourth case, it's b.\n\nSo, these are four distinct cases, each with three variables equal and the fourth different.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nWait, in Case 1: a = b = d, so c is different.\n\nIn Case 2: b = c = d, so a is different.\n\nIn Case 3: a = b = c, so d is different.\n\nIn Case 4: a = c = d, so b is different.\n\nSo, each case is when three variables are equal, and the fourth is different. So, four cases in total.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Or are there more cases?\n\nWait, in the first equality, we had either d = b or a = c.\n\nIn the second equality, we had either b = a or d = c.\n\nSo, the possibilities are:\n\n1. d = b and b = a\n2. d = b and d = c\n3. a = c and b = a\n4. a = c and d = c\n\nSo, these are the four cases, which correspond to the four cases above.\n\nSo, each case is when three variables are equal, and the fourth is different.\n\nTherefore, the quadruples (a, b, c, d) must satisfy that three of them are equal, and the fourth is different.\n\nBut wait, is that the only possibility? Or could there be cases where two pairs are equal, but not all three?\n\nWait, for example, suppose a = c and b = d, but a ≠ b.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me check.\n\nSuppose a = c and b = d.\n\nThen, let's see if the equations hold.\n\nCompute \\( (a + b)(c + d) = (a + b)(a + b) = (a + b)^2 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( (b + c)(a + d) = (b + a)(a + b) = (a + b)^2 \\)\n\nAnd \\( (a + c)(b + d) = (a + a)(b + b) = 2a * 2b = 4ab \\)\n\nSo, for all three expressions to be equal, we must have \\( (a + b)^2 = 4ab \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 4ab \\)\n\nSo, \\( a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 0 \\)\n\nWhich is \\( (a - b)^2 = 0 \\), so a = b.\n\nTherefore, if a = c and b = d, then a must equal b, which would make all four variables equal.\n\nSo, in that case, a = b = c = d.\n\nBut in that case, the sum would be 4a = 100, so a = 25.\n\nSo, the quadruple (25, 25, 25, 25) is a solution.\n\nBut in our earlier cases, we considered three variables equal and the fourth different. So, in this case, all four variables are equal, which is a special case where all three variables are equal, and the fourth is equal as well.\n\nTherefore, in our four cases, the case where all four variables are equal is included in each of them, but in reality, it's just one quadruple.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to count all quadruples where three variables are equal and the fourth is different, as well as the case where all four are equal.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's \"positive integers\", so all four being equal is allowed.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWait, in our four cases, each case includes the possibility where all four are equal, but in reality, when we have three variables equal, the fourth can be equal or different.\n\nBut in the problem, we have the sum equal to 100, so if all four are equal, each is 25, as above.\n\nBut in our four cases, when we have three variables equal, the fourth can be different.\n\nSo, perhaps, the total number of quadruples is the sum over each case, subtracting overlaps where all four are equal.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows.\n\nFrom the two equations, we have that either d = b or a = c, and either b = a or d = c.\n\nSo, the possible cases are:\n\n1. d = b and b = a\n2. d = b and d = c\n3. a = c and b = a\n4. a = c and d = c\n\nEach of these cases leads to three variables being equal, and the fourth being different.\n\nBut in each case, the fourth variable can be different or equal.\n\nWait, but in case 1: d = b and b = a, so a = b = d, and c is different.\n\nSimilarly, in case 2: b = c = d, and a is different.\n\nCase 3: a = b = c, and d is different.\n\nCase 4: a = c = d, and b is different.\n\nSo, in each case, the fourth variable is different.\n\nBut in the case where all four are equal, that is, a = b = c = d, that would satisfy all four cases, but in each case, the fourth variable is equal to the others.\n\nBut in our problem, the quadruples must have a sum of 100, so if all four are equal, each is 25, as above.\n\nSo, in our counting, we need to include this case as well.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total number of quadruples is the sum over each case, but subtracting overlaps where all four are equal.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as follows.\n\nFrom the two equations, we have that either d = b or a = c, and either b = a or d = c.\n\nSo, the possible cases are:\n\n1. d = b and b = a\n2. d = b and d = c\n3. a = c and b = a\n4. a = c and d = c\n\nEach of these cases leads to three variables being equal, and the fourth being different.\n\nBut in each case, the fourth variable is different.\n\nBut in the case where all four are equal, that is, a = b = c = d, that would satisfy all four cases, but in each case, the fourth variable is equal to the others.\n\nTherefore, in our counting, we need to consider that the case where all four are equal is included in each of the four cases.\n\nTherefore, when we count the number of quadruples in each case, we have to be careful not to overcount the all-equal case.\n\nSo, perhaps, the total number of quadruples is 4 times the number of quadruples where three variables are equal and the fourth is different, plus 1 for the all-equal case.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWait, let's think about each case.\n\nCase 1: a = b = d, c different.\n\nSo, a = b = d, and c = 100 - 3a.\n\nBut since c must be a positive integer, 100 - 3a ≥ 1, so 3a ≤ 99, so a ≤ 33.\n\nAlso, a must be at least 1.\n\nSo, a can be from 1 to 33.\n\nBut in this case, c = 100 - 3a must be positive, so a can be from 1 to 33.\n\nBut in this case, c must be different from a, so c ≠ a.\n\nSo, 100 - 3a ≠ a => 100", "answer": "**Najskôr ekvivalentne upravíme prvú rovnicu zo zadania:**\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + d) = (b + c)(a + d),\n\\]\n\\[\nac + ad + bc + bd = ba + bd + ca + cd,\n\\]\n\\[\nad + bc - ab - cd = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\na(d - b) - c(d - b) = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\n(a - c)(d - b) = 0.\n\\]\n\nPodobne zistíme, že druhá rovnica je ekvivalentná s rovnicou\n\n\\[\n(a - b)(d - c) = 0.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Podľa toho, ktoré zo štyroch činiteľov sa v odvedených rovniciach rovnajú nule, sú všetky riešenia \\((a, b, c, d)\\) zadaných rovníc štvorice jedného zo štyroch typov:**\n\n- \\(a - c = 0\\) a \\(a - b = 0\\), čiže \\(a = b = c = d\\) je ľubovoľné,\n- \\(a - c = 0\\) a \\(d - b = 0\\), čiže \\(a = c\\) a \\(b = d\\) je ľubovoľné,\n- \\(a - b = 0\\) a \\(d - c = 0\\), čiže \\(a = b\\) a \\(c = d\\) je ľubovoľné,\n- \\(d - b = 0\\) a \\(d - c = 0\\), čiže \\(b = c = d\\) a \\(a\\) je ľubovoľné.\n\n---\n\n**Dospeli sme k záveru, že rovnice zo zadania platia práve vtedy, keď aspoň tri z čísel a, b, c, d sú si rovné.

Vypočítajte pomer obsahov obdĺžnikov \\(ABCD\\) a \\(KLMN\\).", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem about two rectangles, ABCD and KLMN. The first thing I notice is that ABCD is a rectangle where the ratio of AB to BC is 2:1. That means if AB is twice as long as BC, it's a rectangle that's twice as long in one side compared to the other. I should probably assign some variables to these lengths to make it easier. Let me say that BC is x, so AB would be 2x. That way, the sides are in the ratio 2:1 as given.\n\nNow, the problem mentions points K, L, M, N on the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively. These points form another rectangle KLMN, and the ratio of KL to LM is 3:1. So, similar to ABCD, KLMN is also a rectangle with sides in a 3:1 ratio. My goal is to find the ratio of the areas of ABCD to KLMN.\n\nHmm, okay. Since both are rectangles, their areas will be the product of their respective side lengths. So, if I can find the lengths of KL and LM in terms of x, I can compute the area of KLMN and then compare it to the area of ABCD.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 2x and BC = x. So, if I imagine it, AB is the longer side, BC is the shorter side. Now, points K, L, M, N are on AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. So, K is somewhere on AB, L is on BC, M is on CD, and N is on DA.\n\nSince KLMN is a rectangle, the sides KL and LM must be perpendicular to each other, just like in ABCD. The ratio of KL to LM is 3:1, so KL is three times LM. Let me denote LM as y, so KL would be 3y. Then, the area of KLMN would be 3y * y = 3y².\n\nBut I need to relate y to x. To do that, I should probably express the positions of points K, L, M, N in terms of x and y. Maybe I can use coordinates to model this.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the rectangle ABCD. Let's place point A at (0, 0). Then, since AB is 2x, point B would be at (2x, 0). BC is x, so point C would be at (2x, x), and point D would be at (0, x). So, the coordinates are:\n- A: (0, 0)\n- B: (2x, 0)\n- C: (2x, x)\n- D: (0, x)\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of points K, L, M, N.\n\nPoint K is on AB. Let's say K divides AB in some ratio. Let me denote the distance from A to K as a. So, since AB is from (0,0) to (2x,0), point K would be at (a, 0), where 0 < a < 2x.\n\nSimilarly, point L is on BC. Let's denote the distance from B to L as b. Since BC goes from (2x,0) to (2x,x), point L would be at (2x, b), where 0 < b < x.\n\nPoint M is on CD. CD goes from (2x,x) to (0,x). Let me denote the distance from C to M as c. So, point M would be at (2x - c, x), since moving from C towards D reduces the x-coordinate by c.\n\nPoint N is on DA. DA goes from (0,x) to (0,0). Let me denote the distance from D to N as d. So, point N would be at (0, x - d), where 0 < d < x.\n\nNow, since KLMN is a rectangle, the sides KL and LM must be perpendicular, and the sides MN and NK must also be perpendicular. Additionally, the vectors representing the sides should be equal in length and direction where appropriate.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates again for clarity:\n- K: (a, 0)\n- L: (2x, b)\n- M: (2x - c, x)\n- N: (0, x - d)\n\nSince KLMN is a rectangle, the vector from K to L should be equal to the vector from M to N, and the vector from L to M should be equal to the vector from N to K.\n\nLet me compute the vectors:\n\nVector KL: from K(a,0) to L(2x, b) is (2x - a, b - 0) = (2x - a, b)\nVector LM: from L(2x, b) to M(2x - c, x) is (-c, x - b)\nVector MN: from M(2x - c, x) to N(0, x - d) is (-2x + c, -d)\nVector NK: from N(0, x - d) to K(a, 0) is (a, -x + d)\n\nSince KLMN is a rectangle, vector KL should be equal to vector MN, and vector LM should be equal to vector NK.\n\nSo, setting vector KL equal to vector MN:\n(2x - a, b) = (-2x + c, -d)\nThis gives us two equations:\n1. 2x - a = -2x + c\n2. b = -d\n\nSimilarly, setting vector LM equal to vector NK:\n(-c, x - b) = (a, -x + d)\nThis gives us two more equations:\n3. -c = a\n4. x - b = -x + d\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 3: -c = a => c = -a\n\nBut c is a distance along CD, which is from (2x, x) to (0, x). So, c should be positive and less than 2x. Similarly, a is a distance along AB from A, so a is positive and less than 2x. But equation 3 says c = -a, which would imply c is negative if a is positive. That doesn't make sense because c is a length. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the vectors differently. Maybe vector KL is (2x - a, b), and vector MN is (-2x + c, -d). So, for KL to equal MN, their components must be equal. So, 2x - a = -2x + c and b = -d.\n\nBut since c is a length, it's positive, and a is positive, so 2x - a = -2x + c => 4x = a + c. Since c = -a, substituting, 4x = a + (-a) => 4x = 0, which is impossible. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the vector directions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the vectors in terms of direction. Vector KL goes from K to L, which is (2x - a, b). Vector MN goes from M to N, which is (0 - (2x - c), (x - d) - x) = (-2x + c, -d). So, vector MN is (-2x + c, -d). So, setting KL equal to MN:\n\n(2x - a, b) = (-2x + c, -d)\n\nSo, 2x - a = -2x + c and b = -d.\n\nFrom the first equation: 2x - a = -2x + c => 4x = a + c.\n\nFrom the second equation: b = -d. But since b and d are lengths, they should be positive. So, this suggests that d = -b, but d is a length, so it can't be negative. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I should have considered vector MN as from N to M instead? Wait, no, vector MN is from M to N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered that in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and the adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, maybe I should use the slopes instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the slope of KL and LM.\n\nSlope of KL: from K(a,0) to L(2x, b). The slope is (b - 0)/(2x - a) = b/(2x - a).\n\nSlope of LM: from L(2x, b) to M(2x - c, x). The slope is (x - b)/(-c) = (x - b)/(-c).\n\nSince KL and LM are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nSo, [b/(2x - a)] * [(x - b)/(-c)] = -1\n\nSimplify:\n\n[b(x - b)] / [ (2x - a)(-c) ] = -1\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nb(x - b) / [ -c(2x - a) ] = -1\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nb(x - b) = -1 * [ -c(2x - a) ]\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\nb(x - b) = c(2x - a)\n\nSo, equation 1: b(x - b) = c(2x - a)\n\nSimilarly, let's find the slope of LM and MN.\n\nSlope of LM: (x - b)/(-c) as above.\n\nSlope of MN: from M(2x - c, x) to N(0, x - d). The slope is (x - d - x)/(0 - (2x - c)) = (-d)/(-2x + c) = d/(2x - c)\n\nSince LM and MN are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1.\n\nSo, [(x - b)/(-c)] * [d/(2x - c)] = -1\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(x - b)d] / [ -c(2x - c) ] = -1\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n(x - b)d / [ -c(2x - c) ] = -1\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n(x - b)d = -1 * [ -c(2x - c) ]\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n(x - b)d = c(2x - c)\n\nSo, equation 2: d(x - b) = c(2x - c)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. b(x - b) = c(2x - a)\n2. d(x - b) = c(2x - c)\n\nAdditionally, from the earlier vector approach, we had:\n\nFrom vector KL = vector MN:\n\n2x - a = -2x + c => 4x = a + c\n\nAnd b = -d, but since b and d are positive, this suggests d = -b, which is not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector direction.\n\nWait, maybe vector MN is from N to M, not from M to N. Let me check.\n\nIf vector MN is from M to N, it's (0 - (2x - c), (x - d) - x) = (-2x + c, -d). Vector KL is (2x - a, b). So, setting KL equal to MN:\n\n(2x - a, b) = (-2x + c, -d)\n\nSo, 2x - a = -2x + c => 4x = a + c\n\nAnd b = -d. Again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe vector KL is equal to vector NM, not MN. Let me think.\n\nIn a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and in the same direction. So, vector KL should equal vector MN, and vector LM should equal vector NK.\n\nWait, maybe I got the direction of vectors wrong. Let me define vectors as from the first point to the second point.\n\nSo, vector KL is from K to L: (2x - a, b)\n\nVector MN is from M to N: (0 - (2x - c), (x - d) - x) = (-2x + c, -d)\n\nSo, KL = MN implies (2x - a, b) = (-2x + c, -d)\n\nSo, 2x - a = -2x + c => 4x = a + c\n\nAnd b = -d\n\nBut since b and d are positive, this is a contradiction. So, perhaps the vectors are not equal, but rather, the sides are equal in length and direction.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in a rectangle, the sides are equal and the adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, perhaps I should use the fact that KL is equal in length to MN, and LM is equal in length to NK, and that KL is perpendicular to LM.\n\nSo, let's compute the lengths.\n\nLength of KL: sqrt( (2x - a)^2 + b^2 )\n\nLength of LM: sqrt( (-c)^2 + (x - b)^2 ) = sqrt( c^2 + (x - b)^2 )\n\nLength of MN: sqrt( (-2x + c)^2 + (-d)^2 ) = sqrt( (2x - c)^2 + d^2 )\n\nLength of NK: sqrt( a^2 + (-x + d)^2 ) = sqrt( a^2 + (d - x)^2 )\n\nSince KLMN is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal:\n\nLength KL = Length MN\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (2x - a)^2 + b^2 ) = sqrt( (2x - c)^2 + d^2 )\n\nSimilarly, Length LM = Length NK:\n\nsqrt( c^2 + (x - b)^2 ) = sqrt( a^2 + (d - x)^2 )\n\nAlso, since KL is perpendicular to LM, the product of their slopes is -1, which we already used earlier.\n\nSo, maybe squaring both sides of the length equations will help.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(2x - a)^2 + b^2 = (2x - c)^2 + d^2\n\nSecond equation:\n\nc^2 + (x - b)^2 = a^2 + (d - x)^2\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(4x² - 4x a + a²) + b² = (4x² - 4x c + c²) + d²\n\nSimplify:\n\n4x² - 4x a + a² + b² = 4x² - 4x c + c² + d²\n\nSubtract 4x² from both sides:\n\n-4x a + a² + b² = -4x c + c² + d²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-4x a + a² + b² + 4x c - c² - d² = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n4x(c - a) + (a² - c²) + (b² - d²) = ", "answer": "Dokážeme, že pravouhlé trojuholníky AKN a DNM sú podobné.

In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), so the vertex is at:\n\n\\(a = -\\frac{1}{2 \\times 1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nPlugging this back into the expression:\n\n\\((- \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (- \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nSo, the minimum value in this case is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(a + b = 1\\)**\n\nNow, if \\(a + b = 1\\), I can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\): \\(b = 1 - a\\). Substitute this into the original expression \\(a^2 + b\\):\n\n\\(a^2 + (1 - a) = a^2 - a + 1\\)\n\nAgain, this is a quadratic in \\(a\\). Let's find its minimum. The quadratic is \\(a^2 - a + 1\\), so the vertex is at:\n\n\\(a = -\\frac{-1}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nPlugging this back into the expression:\n\n\\((\\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\\)\n\nSo, the minimum value in this case is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n**Comparing Both Cases**\n\nNow, comparing the two cases:\n\n- Case 1 gives a minimum value of \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n- Case 2 gives a minimum value of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n\nSince \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\) is smaller than \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), the smallest possible value is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that this value is achievable.

The catch is that each number, except the smallest one, has to be a multiple of the sum of all the numbers that come before it. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. I need a sequence of distinct natural numbers, say a1, a2, a3, ..., an, such that:\n\n1. a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an = 2024\n2. For each i from 2 to n, ai is a multiple of the sum of all previous terms, which is S_{i-1} = a1 + a2 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\nAnd I need to maximize n, the number of terms in this sequence.\n\nOkay, so starting with the smallest number, a1, which can be any natural number. Then, a2 has to be a multiple of a1, a3 has to be a multiple of (a1 + a2), a4 has to be a multiple of (a1 + a2 + a3), and so on.\n\nSince I want to maximize the number of terms, I should probably start with the smallest possible a1. The smallest natural number is 1, so let me try that.\n\nLet’s set a1 = 1.\n\nNow, a2 has to be a multiple of 1. Well, any natural number is a multiple of 1, so the smallest possible a2 is 2 (since they have to be different). So, a2 = 2.\n\nNow, the sum so far is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nNext, a3 has to be a multiple of 3. The smallest multiple we can choose that's different from 1 and 2 is 3 itself. So, a3 = 3.\n\nSum now is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nMoving on, a4 has to be a multiple of 6. The smallest available multiple is 6, but we already have 6 as the sum, and we need distinct numbers. So, the next multiple is 12. But wait, 6 is already used as a sum, but the number itself hasn't been used yet. Wait, no, the numbers have to be distinct, but the sum is just a cumulative total. So, a4 can be 6, but since 6 hasn't been used yet, is that allowed?\n\nWait, hold on. The numbers have to be distinct, so a4 can't be 6 because 6 isn't in the sequence yet. Wait, no, the numbers have to be distinct, but the sum is just the sum. So, a4 can be 6, but since 6 isn't in the sequence yet, it's allowed. Wait, but 6 is the sum of the first three terms, but the number itself hasn't been used yet. So, is 6 allowed? Let me think.\n\nActually, the condition is that each number (except the smallest) is a multiple of the sum of all previous numbers. So, a4 must be a multiple of 6, and it can be 6, 12, 18, etc. But since we need distinct numbers, and 6 hasn't been used yet, we can choose 6. But wait, 6 is the sum of the first three terms, but the number itself is 6, which is different. So, is that allowed? I think yes, because the condition is about the sum, not about the individual numbers.\n\nBut wait, if I choose a4 = 6, then the sum becomes 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12. Then, a5 has to be a multiple of 12. The smallest multiple is 12, but we already have 12 as a sum, but the number itself hasn't been used yet. So, a5 = 12. Then the sum becomes 24.\n\nWait, but this seems like a pattern where each term is equal to the sum so far. Let me see:\n\na1 = 1\n\na2 = 2 (multiple of 1)\n\na3 = 3 (multiple of 3)\n\na4 = 6 (multiple of 6)\n\na5 = 12 (multiple of 12)\n\na6 = 24 (multiple of 24)\n\na7 = 48 (multiple of 48)\n\na8 = 96 (multiple of 96)\n\na9 = 192 (multiple of 192)\n\na10 = 384 (multiple of 384)\n\na11 = 768 (multiple of 768)\n\na12 = 1536 (multiple of 1536)\n\nWait, but let's check the sum:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 96 + 192 + 384 + 768 + 1536\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\n3 + 3 = 6\n\n6 + 6 = 12\n\n12 + 12 = 24\n\n24 + 24 = 48\n\n48 + 48 = 96\n\n96 + 96 = 192\n\n192 + 192 = 384\n\n384 + 384 = 768\n\n768 + 768 = 1536\n\n1536 + 1536 = 3072\n\nWait, but 3072 is way more than 2024. So, this approach is overshooting the target sum. So, maybe this isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not choose a4 = 6, but a larger multiple. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to choose the smallest possible multiple each time to maximize the number of terms. So, starting with a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, then a4 must be a multiple of 6. The smallest multiple is 6, but if I choose 6, the sum becomes 12, and then a5 must be a multiple of 12, which is 12, but 12 is already the sum, but the number itself is 12, which hasn't been used yet. So, is 12 allowed? Wait, but 12 is the sum of the first four terms, but the number is 12, which is different. So, it's allowed.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, this leads to the sum doubling each time, which quickly exceeds 2024. So, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps instead of doubling each time, I can choose the next term as the sum itself, but that might not necessarily be the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. The condition is that each term (except the first) is a multiple of the sum of all previous terms. So, if I have a1, a2, ..., ai, then ai+1 must be a multiple of S_i, where S_i = a1 + ... + ai.\n\nSo, if I choose a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, then S2=3, so a3 must be a multiple of 3, which it is (3). Then S3=6, so a4 must be a multiple of 6. The smallest multiple is 6, but if I choose 6, then S4=12, and a5 must be a multiple of 12, which is 12, and so on.\n\nBut as I saw, this leads to the sum growing too quickly. So, maybe I need to choose larger multiples to slow down the growth.\n\nWait, but if I choose larger multiples, the sum will grow even faster, so that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can choose a different starting point. Instead of a1=1, maybe a1=2. Let me see.\n\nIf a1=2, then a2 must be a multiple of 2. The smallest multiple is 4, so a2=4. Then S2=6, so a3 must be a multiple of 6. The smallest multiple is 6, so a3=6. Then S3=12, so a4 must be a multiple of 12. The smallest multiple is 12, so a4=12. Then S4=24, a5=24, and so on. Again, the sum doubles each time, leading to a rapid increase.\n\nBut 2 + 4 + 6 + 12 + 24 + ... will also exceed 2024 quickly.\n\nWait, maybe starting with a1=1 is better because the sum grows slower? Let me check.\n\nWith a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, S3=6, a4=6, S4=12, a5=12, S5=24, a6=24, S6=48, a7=48, S7=96, a8=96, S8=192, a9=192, S9=384, a10=384, S10=768, a11=768, S11=1536, a12=1536, S12=3072.\n\nBut 3072 is way over 2024. So, maybe I need to stop earlier.\n\nWait, but 1536 is already over 2024 when added to 768. So, perhaps I can't go all the way to a12.\n\nWait, let's calculate the sum step by step:\n\na1=1, sum=1\n\na2=2, sum=3\n\na3=3, sum=6\n\na4=6, sum=12\n\na5=12, sum=24\n\na6=24, sum=48\n\na7=48, sum=96\n\na8=96, sum=192\n\na9=192, sum=384\n\na10=384, sum=768\n\na11=768, sum=1536\n\na12=1536, sum=3072\n\nSo, at a11, the sum is 1536, which is less than 2024. Then, a12 would have to be a multiple of 1536, but 1536*2=3072, which would make the total sum 4608, which is way over. So, we can't add a12.\n\nBut maybe instead of adding a12, we can adjust the last term to make the total sum 2024.\n\nSo, up to a11, the sum is 1536. We need to add a12 such that a12 is a multiple of 1536, and 1536 + a12 = 2024.\n\nSo, a12 = 2024 - 1536 = 488.\n\nBut 488 must be a multiple of 1536. Is 488 a multiple of 1536? 1536 divided by 488 is approximately 3.15, which is not an integer. So, 488 is not a multiple of 1536. Therefore, we can't choose a12=488.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can adjust one of the previous terms to make a12 a multiple of 1536. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can stop at a11, with sum 1536, and then see if we can add another term after that without violating the multiple condition.\n\nWait, but after a11, the next term a12 must be a multiple of 1536, which is too big because 1536*2=3072, which is way over 2024. So, we can't add a12.\n\nTherefore, maybe the maximum number of terms is 11, with the sum being 1536, but we need to reach 2024. So, perhaps we can adjust some of the previous terms to make the last term fit.\n\nWait, but all the terms are multiples of the previous sums, so changing one term might affect the multiples required for the subsequent terms. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of choosing a4=6, we can choose a larger multiple so that the sum doesn't grow as fast.\n\nWait, let's try that. So, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, S3=6. Instead of a4=6, let's choose a4=12. Then, S4=1+2+3+12=18. Then, a5 must be a multiple of 18. The smallest multiple is 18, so a5=18, S5=36. a6 must be a multiple of 36, so a6=36, S6=72. a7=72, S7=144. a8=144, S8=288. a9=288, S9=576. a10=576, S10=1152. a11=1152, S11=2304.\n\nWait, but 2304 is way over 2024. So, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choose a4= something else. Let's see.\n\nWait, if a4 must be a multiple of 6, and we need the sum to not exceed 2024, maybe choosing a4=6 is necessary, but then we have to adjust the last term.\n\nWait, let's see. If we have a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=6, sum=12. Then a5 must be a multiple of 12. Let's choose a5=12, sum=24. a6=24, sum=48. a7=48, sum=96. a8=96, sum=192. a9=192, sum=384. a10=384, sum=768. a11=768, sum=1536. Now, we need to add a12 such that 1536 + a12 = 2024.

Then, it's translated by a vector of length 1 to get another triangle A'B'C'. I need to find the smallest possible area of the intersection of these two triangles.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize what's happening here. Translating a triangle by a vector of length 1 means moving it without rotating it. The direction of the vector isn't specified, so I guess I have to consider all possible directions and find the one that minimizes the overlapping area.\n\nI remember that when you translate a shape, the intersection area depends on how much the original and translated shapes overlap. Since the vector has a fixed length of 1, the amount of overlap will vary depending on the direction of the translation.\n\nMaybe I should start by finding some properties of triangle ABC. It has sides 13, 14, 15, which I think is a well-known triangle. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem: 13² + 14² = 169 + 196 = 365, which isn't equal to 15² = 225. So, it's not a right-angled triangle. Maybe I can compute its area to get a better idea.\n\nTo find the area of triangle ABC, I can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter, s, is (13 + 14 + 15)/2 = 21. Then, the area is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)] = sqrt[21(21 - 13)(21 - 14)(21 - 15)] = sqrt[21*8*7*6]. Calculating that: 21*8=168, 168*7=1176, 1176*6=7056. So sqrt(7056) is 84. So the area of ABC is 84.\n\nNow, when we translate the triangle by a vector of length 1, the area of the intersection will depend on how the translation affects the overlapping region. I think the minimal area occurs when the translation is such that the two triangles overlap as little as possible.\n\nI recall that the minimal intersection area might be related to the area of the original triangle minus the area of the translated part that sticks out. But I'm not sure exactly how to compute that.\n\nMaybe I should consider the Minkowski sum or something related to the movement of the triangle. But since it's a translation, perhaps the intersection area can be found by considering the relative positions of the two triangles.\n\nAnother thought: the minimal intersection area might be when the translation vector is perpendicular to one of the sides of the triangle. That way, the translation would cause the triangle to move just enough to minimize overlap.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Suppose the translation vector is perpendicular to side BC, which is 14 units long. The height of the triangle from A to BC can be calculated. The area is 84, so the height h from A to BC is (2*84)/14 = 12. So, the height is 12 units.\n\nIf I translate the triangle by a vector of length 1 in the direction perpendicular to BC, then the translated triangle A'B'C' will be shifted by 1 unit away from BC. Since the original height is 12, the translated triangle will now be 1 unit away from BC, so the distance between the two bases BC and B'C' is 1 unit.\n\nIn this case, the overlapping region would be a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the distance between them.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two triangles ABC and A'B'C' would overlap in a region that's a smaller triangle or a quadrilateral? Hmm, maybe it's a quadrilateral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intersection is a hexagon or another polygon. I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the translation along the height. If I move the triangle by 1 unit along the height, the overlapping area would be a smaller triangle similar to ABC but scaled down.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should compute the coordinates of the triangle and then see how the translation affects the intersection.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to triangle ABC. Let me place point B at (0, 0), point C at (14, 0). Then, point A is somewhere in the plane. Since AB = 13 and AC = 15, I can find the coordinates of A.\n\nUsing the distance formula, the coordinates of A satisfy:\n\nDistance from A to B: sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 13\n\nDistance from A to C: sqrt((x - 14)^2 + (y)^2) = 15\n\nSo, setting up the equations:\n\nx² + y² = 169\n\n(x - 14)² + y² = 225\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 14)² + y² - x² - y² = 225 - 169\n\nExpanding (x - 14)²: x² - 28x + 196\n\nSo, x² - 28x + 196 - x² = 56\n\nSimplify: -28x + 196 = 56\n\n-28x = 56 - 196 = -140\n\nx = (-140)/(-28) = 5\n\nThen, plugging x = 5 into x² + y² = 169:\n\n25 + y² = 169 => y² = 144 => y = 12 or y = -12. Let's take y = 12 for simplicity.\n\nSo, coordinates are: B(0,0), C(14,0), A(5,12).\n\nNow, if we translate the triangle by a vector of length 1, say in the direction perpendicular to BC, which is along the y-axis. So, translating upwards or downwards.\n\nIf we translate upwards by 1 unit, the new coordinates would be A'(5,13), B'(0,1), C'(14,1). If we translate downwards, A'(5,11), B'(0,-1), C'(14,-1). Let's see which direction gives a smaller intersection.\n\nBut actually, since the original triangle is above BC, translating upwards would move it further away, while translating downwards would bring it closer. So, translating downwards might result in a larger intersection, while translating upwards might result in a smaller intersection.\n\nWait, but the minimal area could be when the translation is in a direction that causes the two triangles to overlap as little as possible. So, maybe translating in a direction that is not along the height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps translating along a direction that is parallel to one of the sides.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal area occurs when the translation vector is such that one vertex of the translated triangle just touches a side of the original triangle. That might minimize the overlapping area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal area is when the translation vector is in the direction that causes the two triangles to overlap in a line, but that would result in zero area, which isn't possible because the triangles are rigid.\n\nWait, no, because translating a triangle by any vector, even a small one, will result in an overlapping area, unless the translation is such that the triangles are just barely not overlapping. But since the vector is length 1, and the triangle has height 12, maybe translating by 1 unit in the direction towards the base would cause a small overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal area is when the translation is such that the translated triangle just touches the original triangle at a single point, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal area is when the translation vector is in the direction that causes the two triangles to overlap in a smaller triangle whose area is minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the area of intersection as a function of the translation vector's direction and then find its minimum.\n\nLet me denote the translation vector as **v** with |**v**| = 1. The translated triangle is A'B'C' = A + **v**, B + **v**, C + **v**.\n\nThe intersection area depends on the relative positions of ABC and A'B'C'. To find the minimal area, I might need to find the orientation of **v** that minimizes the overlapping area.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can use some geometric intuition.\n\nI remember that the minimal intersection area occurs when the translation vector is such that the two triangles are as \"misaligned\" as possible. Since the original triangle has a height of 12, translating it by 1 unit in the direction perpendicular to the base would cause the translated triangle to overlap with the original triangle in a region whose area is the original area minus the area of the part that's translated out.\n\nBut wait, the original area is 84. If I translate the triangle by 1 unit in the direction perpendicular to the base BC, the overlapping area would be a trapezoid with height 11 (since 12 - 1 = 11). The area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\nBut in this case, the two triangles would overlap in a region that's a smaller triangle similar to ABC but scaled down. Wait, no, because the translation is only 1 unit, so the overlapping region might not be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overlapping area is a hexagon. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should compute the coordinates after translation and then find the intersection polygon.\n\nLet me try that. Let's say we translate the triangle ABC by a vector (0,1). So, the new coordinates are A'(5,13), B'(0,1), C'(14,1).\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of ABC and A'B'C'.\n\nThe original triangle ABC has vertices at (0,0), (14,0), (5,12). The translated triangle A'B'C' has vertices at (5,13), (0,1), (14,1).\n\nTo find the intersection, I can find the overlapping region by checking the intersection of the two triangles.\n\nThis might involve finding the intersection points of the edges of ABC with the edges of A'B'C'.\n\nLet me list the edges of ABC:\n\n1. AB: from (0,0) to (5,12)\n2. BC: from (0,0) to (14,0)\n3. AC: from (5,12) to (14,0)\n\nEdges of A'B'C':\n\n1. A'B': from (5,13) to (0,1)\n2. B'C': from (0,1) to (14,1)\n3. A'C': from (5,13) to (14,1)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection points between these edges.\n\nFirst, check if any edges intersect.\n\nCheck AB (from (0,0) to (5,12)) and A'B' (from (5,13) to (0,1)).\n\nParametrize AB: (x, y) = (5t, 12t), t ∈ [0,1]\n\nParametrize A'B': (x, y) = (5 - 5s, 13 - 12s), s ∈ [0,1]\n\nSet them equal:\n\n5t = 5 - 5s\n\n12t = 13 - 12s\n\nFrom the first equation: t = 1 - s\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n12(1 - s) = 13 - 12s\n\n12 - 12s = 13 - 12s\n\n12 = 13, which is impossible. So, AB and A'B' do not intersect.\n\nNext, check AB and B'C'.\n\nAB: (5t, 12t)\n\nB'C': (14s, 1), s ∈ [0,1]\n\nSet equal:\n\n5t = 14s\n\n12t = 1\n\nFrom the second equation: t = 1/12\n\nThen, s = (5t)/14 = (5/12)/14 = 5/(12*14) = 5/168 ≈ 0.0298\n\nSince s ≈ 0.0298 is within [0,1], the lines intersect at (5*(1/12), 12*(1/12)) = (5/12, 1). So, the intersection point is (5/12, 1).\n\nSimilarly, check AB and A'C'.\n\nA'C' is from (5,13) to (14,1). Let's parametrize it as (5 + 9s, 13 - 12s), s ∈ [0,1]\n\nSet equal to AB: (5t, 12t)\n\nSo,\n\n5t = 5 + 9s\n\n12t = 13 - 12s\n\nFrom the first equation: t = 1 + (9/5)s\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n12*(1 + (9/5)s) = 13 - 12s\n\n12 + (108/5)s = 13 - 12s\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate fractions:\n\n60 + 108s = 65 - 60s\n\n108s + 60s = 65 - 60\n\n168s = 5\n\ns = 5/168 ≈ 0.0298\n\nThen, t = 1 + (9/5)*(5/168) = 1 + 9/168 = 1 + 3/56 ≈ 1.0536\n\nBut t must be ≤ 1, so this intersection is outside the segment AB. So, no intersection on AB and A'C'.\n\nNext, check BC (from (0,0) to (14,0)) and A'B' (from (5,13) to (0,1)).\n\nParametrize BC: (x, y) = (14t, 0), t ∈ [0,1]\n\nParametrize A'B': (5 - 5s, 13 - 12s), s ∈ [0,1]\n\nSet equal:\n\n14t = 5 - 5s\n\n0 = 13 - 12s\n\nFrom the second equation: 12s = 13 => s = 13/12 ≈ 1.0833, which is outside [0,1]. So, no intersection.\n\nCheck BC and", "answer": "\\( S(ABC) ⋅ (1 − (1 / |B; CA|))² = 84 ⋅ (1 − (5 / 56))² = 7803 / 112 ≈ 69,67. \\)"}

Ak áno, určte všetky také dvojice prvočísel.", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to create a 9-digit number using digits 1 through 9, each used exactly once. Then, for each pair of consecutive digits, I form a two-digit number and find its smallest prime divisor. The question is whether it's possible to end up with exactly two different prime numbers from all these two-digit numbers. If yes, I need to find all such pairs of primes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to arrange the digits 1 to 9 in some order, making sure each digit is used once. Then, for each adjacent pair, like the first and second digit, second and third, and so on up to the eighth and ninth, I form a two-digit number. For each of these two-digit numbers, I find the smallest prime that divides it. The goal is to have exactly two distinct primes from all these smallest prime divisors.\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out how many two-digit numbers I'll be dealing with. Since it's a 9-digit number, there will be 8 two-digit pairs. Each of these pairs will have a smallest prime divisor, and we need exactly two different primes among these 8.\n\nI should note that the smallest prime divisor of a two-digit number can't be larger than the square root of that number. For example, the smallest prime divisor of 25 is 5, which is the square root. For primes themselves, their smallest prime divisor is themselves.\n\nSo, the primes between 1 and 9 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. These are the only possible primes that can be the smallest prime divisors of the two-digit numbers formed. Because any two-digit number will have a smallest prime divisor that is at least 2 and at most 7, since 11 is a prime but its smallest prime divisor is 11, which is larger than 9, but wait, 11 is a two-digit prime, but its smallest prime divisor is itself, which is 11, but since we're only considering digits 1-9, the two-digit numbers can go up to 98, but their smallest prime divisors can be up to 47, but actually, the smallest prime divisor can't be larger than the square root of the number. Wait, no, the smallest prime divisor can be as large as the number itself if it's prime.\n\nBut in our case, since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, the smallest prime divisor can be up to 97, but that's not possible because the two-digit numbers are formed from digits 1-9, so the maximum two-digit number is 98, but 98's smallest prime divisor is 2. Wait, no, 98 is 2*49, so 2 is the smallest prime divisor. Similarly, 97 is a prime, so its smallest prime divisor is 97, but 97 is a two-digit prime, but in our case, the two-digit numbers are formed from digits 1-9, so 97 is possible, but its smallest prime divisor is 97, which is a two-digit prime. However, 97 is a prime, so if a two-digit number is 97, its smallest prime divisor is 97. But 97 is a prime, so it's its own smallest prime divisor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"najmenší prvočíselný deliteľ,\" which translates to \"smallest prime divisor.\" So, for prime numbers, the smallest prime divisor is the number itself. So, if any of the two-digit numbers formed is a prime, then its smallest prime divisor is that prime. So, in our case, if any two-digit number is a prime, then that prime will be one of the smallest prime divisors.\n\nBut the problem is asking if we can have exactly two different primes among all the smallest prime divisors. So, if any of the two-digit numbers is a prime, then that prime is included in our set of primes. So, if we have two primes as the smallest prime divisors, that would mean that among the 8 two-digit numbers, exactly two of them are primes, and the rest are composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is one of those two primes.\n\nWait, no. Because even if a two-digit number is composite, its smallest prime divisor could be one of the two primes we're targeting. So, for example, if we have two primes p and q, then all composite two-digit numbers formed must have their smallest prime divisor as either p or q. So, the composite numbers must be multiples of p or q, but not multiples of any other primes.\n\nBut wait, the composite numbers can have other prime factors, but their smallest prime factor must be either p or q. So, for example, if p=2 and q=3, then any composite number must be even (divisible by 2) or divisible by 3, but not by any smaller primes. But since 2 is the smallest prime, any composite number must be divisible by 2 or 3, but if it's divisible by 2, its smallest prime divisor is 2, and if it's divisible by 3, its smallest prime divisor is 3.\n\nBut wait, actually, the smallest prime divisor of a composite number is the smallest prime that divides it. So, for example, 15 is 3*5, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 21 is 3*7, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 25 is 5*5, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 27 is 3*9, but 9 is not prime, so 27 is 3^3, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 35 is 5*7, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 45 is 3*15, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 49 is 7*7, so its smallest prime divisor is 7. 51 is 3*17, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 55 is 5*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 57 is 3*19, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 63 is 3*21, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 65 is 5*13, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 69 is 3*23, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 75 is 3*25, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 77 is 7*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 7. 81 is 3*27, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 85 is 5*17, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 87 is 3*29, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 91 is 7*13, so its smallest prime divisor is 7. 93 is 3*31, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 95 is 5*19, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 99 is 9*11, but 9 is not prime, so 99 is 3*33, so its smallest prime divisor is 3.\n\nSo, from this, we can see that composite two-digit numbers can have their smallest prime divisor as 2, 3, 5, or 7. But in our case, we can only have two different primes as the smallest prime divisors. So, we need to choose two primes, say p and q, and arrange the digits such that all composite two-digit numbers formed have their smallest prime divisor as either p or q. Additionally, any prime two-digit numbers formed must be either p or q.\n\nBut wait, the two-digit primes between 10 and 99 are numerous. For example, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. So, there are 21 two-digit primes. So, if we are to have only two primes as the smallest prime divisors, then among these 21 primes, only two of them can appear as the smallest prime divisors, which would mean that all other two-digit primes must not appear as the smallest prime divisors. But wait, that's impossible because if a two-digit prime is formed, its smallest prime divisor is itself, so it would have to be one of the two primes we're targeting. Therefore, all two-digit primes formed must be either p or q.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible because, for example, 11 is a prime, so if 11 is formed as a two-digit number, its smallest prime divisor is 11, which is a two-digit prime. But in our case, the two-digit numbers are formed from digits 1-9, so 11 is possible, but its smallest prime divisor is 11, which is a two-digit prime. So, if 11 is formed, then 11 would be one of the smallest prime divisors. Similarly, 13 would have 13 as its smallest prime divisor, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is that if we have any two-digit prime in our sequence, its smallest prime divisor is itself, which is a two-digit prime. So, if we have more than two two-digit primes in our sequence, then we would have more than two smallest prime divisors, which would violate the condition of having exactly two different primes.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have exactly two different primes as the smallest prime divisors is to have exactly two two-digit primes in the sequence, and all other two-digit numbers must be composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is one of those two primes.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily true. Because even if a two-digit number is a prime, its smallest prime divisor is itself, so if we have a two-digit prime in the sequence, it contributes a new prime to our set. Therefore, to have exactly two different primes as the smallest prime divisors, we must have exactly two two-digit primes in the sequence, and all other two-digit numbers must be composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is one of those two primes.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible because, for example, if we have two two-digit primes, say 11 and 13, then their smallest prime divisors are 11 and 13, which are two different primes. Then, all other two-digit numbers must be composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is either 11 or 13. But 11 and 13 are primes themselves, so any composite number that is a multiple of 11 or 13 will have 11 or 13 as their smallest prime divisor. However, 11 and 13 are two-digit primes, so any composite number that is a multiple of 11 or 13 will have 11 or 13 as their smallest prime divisor.\n\nBut wait, for example, 22 is 2*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 2, not 11. So, if we have 22 as a two-digit number, its smallest prime divisor is 2, which is different from 11 and 13. Therefore, if we include 22, then 2 would be another prime in our set, which would make the total number of primes more than two.\n\nTherefore, to have exactly two different primes as the smallest prime divisors, all composite two-digit numbers must have their smallest prime divisor as one of the two primes, and no two-digit prime can be formed. Because if a two-digit prime is formed, its smallest prime divisor is itself, which is a two-digit prime, and that would add another prime to our set.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have exactly two different primes as the smallest prime divisors is to have all two-digit numbers either composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is one of the two primes, and no two-digit primes at all. So, all two-digit numbers must be composite, and their smallest prime divisor must be one of the two primes.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this. If all two-digit numbers are composite, then their smallest prime divisors must be primes less than or equal to their square roots. So, for a two-digit number, the smallest prime divisor can be 2, 3, 5, or 7, because 11 is already larger than the square root of 22 (which is about 4.69), so 11 can't be the smallest prime divisor of any two-digit number, because any two-digit number divisible by 11 would have 11 as a prime factor, but 11 is larger than the square root of the number, so the number must have a smaller prime factor.\n\nWait, no. For example, 22 is 2*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 2, which is less than 11. Similarly, 33 is 3*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 3. 44 is 4*11, but 4 is not prime, so 44 is 2*2*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 2. 55 is 5*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 5. 66 is 2*3*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 2. 77 is 7*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 7. 88 is 8*11, but 8 is not prime, so 88 is 2*2*2*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 2. 99 is 9*11, but 9 is not prime, so 99 is 3*3*11, so its smallest prime divisor is 3.\n\nSo, in this case, the composite two-digit numbers that are multiples of 11 have their smallest prime divisor as 2, 3, 5, or 7, depending on their other factors. Therefore, if we choose 11 as one of our two primes, we cannot have any composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is 11, because that would require the composite number to be a multiple of 11 and not divisible by any smaller prime. But as we saw, all composite two-digit multiples of 11 are also divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, so their smallest prime divisor is one of those.\n\nTherefore, if we include 11 as one of our two primes, we cannot have any composite numbers whose smallest prime divisor is 11, because all such numbers would have a smaller prime divisor. Therefore, 11 cannot be one of the two primes if we want all composite numbers to have their smallest prime divisor as one of the two primes.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if we include 11 as one of the two primes, then any composite number that", "answer": "Z cifier 1 až 9 sú 4 párne (2, 4, 6, 8), takže aspoň 3 a najviac 4 uvažované dvojčíslia sú párne.

The question is asking for which positive natural numbers n this is possible, specifically for parts a) 2 and b) 3. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that an equilateral triangle can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles. For example, if n is 2, I imagine dividing each side into two equal parts and drawing lines parallel to the sides. That should create four smaller equilateral triangles, each with side length 1. So, for n=2, it seems possible. But wait, the question is about whether it can be \"rovnosťným\" (which I think means \"equally\" or \"evenly\") \"delením\" (divided) into \"zhodných\" (similar) \"dielikov\" (parts) that are \"tvorené z\" (formed from) smaller equilateral triangles of side length 1. So, for n=2, yes, it's possible because we can split it into four smaller ones.\n\nNow, for n=3. If I try to divide each side into three equal parts, and then draw lines parallel to the sides, I should get nine smaller equilateral triangles, each with side length 1. That seems straightforward. So, n=3 should also work. But wait, maybe there's a catch. Sometimes, these kinds of problems have constraints that aren't immediately obvious. Let me think deeper.\n\nI remember that for a triangle to be divided into smaller equilateral triangles, the side length n must be such that it can be expressed as a sum of smaller triangles in a way that maintains the equilateral structure. For n=2, it's 2 small triangles along each side, and for n=3, it's 3. But is there a mathematical condition that n must satisfy?\n\nI think it has to do with the area. The area of the large triangle is (√3/4)*n², and each small triangle has an area of (√3/4)*1² = √3/4. So, the number of small triangles should be n². For n=2, that's 4 small triangles, which matches. For n=3, that's 9 small triangles, which also matches. So, in terms of area, it seems possible for any n.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not just about the area. There might be a parity or divisibility condition. For example, in some tiling problems, certain numbers don't work because of how the tiles fit together. Let me consider the structure.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, when you divide it into smaller equilateral triangles, each side of the large triangle is divided into n segments. Then, the number of small triangles is n². So, for any positive integer n, this should work. But the question is specifically about \"rovnosťným\" division, which I think refers to dividing into equal parts, so maybe it's about whether n is a power of 2 or something? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because n=3 is also possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about whether n is a multiple of 2 or 3. But n=2 and n=3 are both allowed, so that can't be it. Maybe it's about whether n is a triangular number? No, n=2 and n=3 are both triangular numbers, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about whether the triangle can be divided into smaller triangles without overlap or gaps. For n=2 and n=3, that's definitely possible. In fact, I know that any equilateral triangle can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles of side length 1 as long as n is a positive integer. So, maybe the answer is that it's possible for all positive integers n.\n\nBut the question is specifically about parts a) 2 and b) 3. So, for a) n=2, yes, it's possible. For b) n=3, also yes. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check online or recall if there's a theorem about this.\n\nOh, right! This is related to the concept of \"equilateral triangle tiling.\" In general, any equilateral triangle can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles of equal size if the number of divisions per side is an integer. So, for any n, it's possible. Therefore, both n=2 and n=3 are possible.\n\nWait, but sometimes in these problems, especially in math competitions, there might be a trick or a specific condition. For example, maybe for n=2, it's possible, but for n=3, it's not? Or vice versa. Let me think about the actual tiling.\n\nFor n=2: Divide each side into two equal parts, draw lines parallel to the sides. That gives four small triangles, each of side length 1. That works.\n\nFor n=3: Divide each side into three equal parts, draw lines parallel to the sides. That gives nine small triangles, each of side length 1. That also works.\n\nI don't see any reason why it wouldn't work for these values. So, I think the answer is that both a) and b) are possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is about whether the division is into congruent triangles, not just similar. Because in the problem statement, it says \"zhodné\" (similar) dielikov, which I think means congruent. So, are the small triangles congruent?\n\nFor n=2, yes, the four small triangles are congruent. For n=3, the nine small triangles are congruent. So, in both cases, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about dividing into smaller triangles that are not only congruent but also form a specific pattern. But I think the standard division into smaller equilateral triangles results in congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that both a) and b) are possible. So, the answer is yes for both n=2 and n=3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe for n=2, it's possible, but for n=3, it's not? Or maybe the other way around. Let me visualize it.\n\nFor n=2: Imagine an equilateral triangle, split each side into two. Connect the midpoints with lines parallel to the sides. That gives four small triangles, each with side length 1. They are all congruent. So, yes.\n\nFor n=3: Split each side into three. Connect the division points with lines parallel to the sides. That gives nine small triangles, each with side length 1. They are all congruent. So, yes.\n\nI think I'm confident now. The answer is that both a) and b) are possible. So, for both n=2 and n=3, it's possible to divide the large equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles of side length 1.\n\nBut wait, the original question is in two parts: a) 2, b) 3. So, it's asking for each separately. So, the answer is yes for both.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the question is about whether the division is possible without overlapping or leaving gaps, which is always true for these cases. So, yes, both are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether the division is possible into a specific number of triangles. For n=2, it's 4 triangles, for n=3, it's 9 triangles. Both are perfect squares, which makes sense because the number of small triangles is n².\n\nSo, in conclusion, both a) and b) are possible. Therefore, the answer is yes for both.\n\nBut wait, the original question is in two parts: a) 2, b) 3. So, it's asking for each separately. So, the answer is yes for both.\n\nBut let me check if there's any restriction. For example, sometimes in tiling problems, certain numbers don't work because of parity or other reasons. But in this case, since n is the number of divisions per side, and each division leads to n² small triangles, which is always possible.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that both a) and b) are possible.

Určte všetky možné veľkosti uhla BAC.", "response": "Alright, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out all possible measures of angle BAC in triangle ABC. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions an acute-angled triangle ABC with a circumscribed circle k. That means all three vertices of the triangle lie on the circle k. Now, it says that the reflection of the triangle over the line BC is taken. So, reflecting triangle ABC over BC would create a mirror image of the triangle on the other side of BC. Let me visualize that: if ABC is above BC, the reflection would be below BC, right?\n\nThis reflection is denoted as some triangle, maybe A'BC? Wait, no, the reflection of point A over BC would be a new point, let's call it A'. So, the reflected triangle is A'BC. Now, the problem states that this reflection intersects the opposite rays of BA and CA at points D and E, respectively, and these points are different from B and C. So, the reflected point A' is connected to B and C, forming triangle A'BC, and the lines BA' and CA' intersect the opposite rays of BA and CA at D and E.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify: the reflection of the triangle over BC would mean reflecting each point. So, point A is reflected to A', point B stays the same, and point C stays the same. So, the reflected triangle is A'BC. Now, the lines BA' and CA' are drawn, and these lines intersect the opposite rays of BA and CA at D and E, respectively. So, the opposite ray of BA would be the ray starting at B and going in the opposite direction of A, right? Similarly, the opposite ray of CA would be the ray starting at C and going in the opposite direction of A.\n\nSo, if I imagine triangle ABC with A at the top, BC as the base, reflecting A over BC gives A'. Then, drawing BA' and CA', these lines will intersect the opposite rays of BA and CA at D and E. So, D is on the extension of BA beyond A, and E is on the extension of CA beyond A. So, D and E are points beyond A on those rays.\n\nNow, the problem says that segments CD and BE intersect on the circle k. So, CD is a segment from C to D, and BE is a segment from B to E, and their intersection point lies on the circumscribed circle k of triangle ABC.\n\nI need to find all possible measures of angle BAC. Since ABC is acute, angle BAC is less than 90 degrees.\n\nLet me try to draw this out mentally. Triangle ABC is acute, with circumcircle k. Reflecting A over BC gives A'. Then, BA' and CA' intersect the opposite rays at D and E. Then, CD and BE intersect on k.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use some properties of reflections and cyclic quadrilaterals here. Since A' is the reflection of A over BC, BA' = BA, and CA' = CA. Also, angle ABA' and angle ACA' are right angles because reflection over BC would make those angles 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no, actually, reflecting A over BC gives A', so BA' = BA, and CA' = CA, but the angles at B and C with respect to A' would be equal to the original angles at B and C with respect to A. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since A' is the reflection, the line BC is the perpendicular bisector of AA'. So, any point on BC is equidistant from A and A'. So, points B and C are on BC, so BA' = BA and CA' = CA.\n\nNow, considering that CD and BE intersect on the circumcircle k. Let me denote the intersection point as F. So, F is on k, and F is the intersection of CD and BE.\n\nSince F is on the circumcircle, maybe some cyclic quadrilateral properties can be applied here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. Since D is on the extension of BA beyond A, and E is on the extension of CA beyond A, perhaps the power of points D and E with respect to circle k can be used.\n\nWait, but D and E are points where BA' and CA' meet the opposite rays. So, maybe I can express the power of D and E with respect to circle k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up coordinates to model this.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (c,0), and point A somewhere in the first quadrant since the triangle is acute. Then, the reflection of A over BC (the x-axis in this coordinate system) would be A' at (a_x, -a_y) if A is at (a_x, a_y).\n\nThen, BA' is the line from B(0,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y). Similarly, CA' is the line from C(c,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y).\n\nNow, the opposite rays of BA and CA would be the rays starting at B and going in the opposite direction of A, and starting at C and going in the opposite direction of A. So, the opposite ray of BA would be the ray from B through A, extended beyond A, and similarly for CA.\n\nWait, no, the opposite ray of BA would be the ray starting at B and going in the direction opposite to A, which would be towards negative infinity if BA is going towards A. Similarly, the opposite ray of CA would be starting at C and going opposite to A.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the equations of BA' and CA', and then find points D and E where these lines intersect the opposite rays of BA and CA.\n\nSo, first, the opposite ray of BA: since BA goes from B(0,0) to A(a_x, a_y), the opposite ray would be from B(0,0) through A(a_x, a_y) and beyond. So, the parametric equation of BA is (ta_x, ta_y) for t >= 0. The opposite ray would be for t <= 0, but since D is on the opposite ray beyond B, maybe t < 0? Wait, no, the opposite ray of BA would be starting at B and going in the opposite direction of A, so it would be the ray from B through A, but extended beyond A. Wait, no, the opposite ray of BA would be the ray starting at B and going in the direction opposite to A, which would be towards negative infinity if BA is going towards A. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors. The direction vector of BA is (a_x, a_y), so the opposite direction would be (-a_x, -a_y). So, the opposite ray of BA would start at B(0,0) and go in the direction (-a_x, -a_y). Similarly, the opposite ray of CA would start at C(c,0) and go in the direction opposite to CA, which is (- (a_x - c), -a_y).\n\nWait, maybe I should parameterize these lines.\n\nSo, BA' is the line from B(0,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y). The parametric equation for BA' is (ta_x, -ta_y) for t >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, the opposite ray of BA would be the line starting at B(0,0) and going in the direction opposite to BA, which is (-a_x, -a_y). So, the parametric equation for the opposite ray of BA is (0 - s*a_x, 0 - s*a_y) = (-s*a_x, -s*a_y) for s >= 0.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of BA' and the opposite ray of BA. So, we can set the parametric equations equal:\n\nta_x = -s*a_x\n\n-ta_y = -s*a_y\n\nFrom the first equation: ta_x = -s*a_x => t = -s (since a_x ≠ 0, as A is not on BC)\n\nFrom the second equation: -ta_y = -s*a_y => t = s (since a_y ≠ 0, as A is not on BC)\n\nBut from the first equation, t = -s, and from the second, t = s. So, s = -s => s = 0, which would give t = 0, which is point B. But D is supposed to be different from B, so this suggests that BA' and the opposite ray of BA only intersect at B, which is not allowed. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the opposite ray of BA is not in the direction (-a_x, -a_y), but rather in the direction opposite to BA, which would be from B towards the opposite side of A. So, if BA is from B to A, then the opposite ray would be from B through A and beyond, but that's the same as BA extended beyond A. Wait, no, the opposite ray of BA would be starting at B and going in the direction opposite to A, which would be towards negative infinity if BA is going towards A. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the opposite ray of BA is the ray starting at B and going in the direction opposite to A, which would be towards negative infinity if BA is going towards A. So, the parametric equation would be (0 - s*a_x, 0 - s*a_y) for s >= 0, as I had before. But then, BA' is from B(0,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y), so parametric equation (ta_x, -ta_y) for t >= 0.\n\nSetting these equal: ta_x = -s*a_x and -ta_y = -s*a_y. So, t = -s and t = s, which only holds when s = t = 0, which is point B. But D is supposed to be different from B, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the opposite ray of BA is not starting at B but starting at A and going in the opposite direction of BA. That is, the ray starting at A and going away from B. Similarly, the opposite ray of CA would start at A and go away from C.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the opposite ray of BA would be the ray starting at A and going in the direction opposite to BA, which is from A towards the opposite side of B. Similarly, the opposite ray of CA would be the ray starting at A and going in the direction opposite to CA, which is from A towards the opposite side of C.\n\nSo, in that case, BA' is the line from B to A', and it intersects the opposite ray of BA (starting at A and going opposite to BA) at point D. Similarly, CA' intersects the opposite ray of CA (starting at A and going opposite to CA) at point E.\n\nSo, let me correct the parametrization.\n\nThe opposite ray of BA is the ray starting at A and going in the direction opposite to BA. The direction vector of BA is from B to A, which is (a_x, a_y). So, the opposite direction is (-a_x, -a_y). Therefore, the parametric equation of the opposite ray of BA is (a_x - s*a_x, a_y - s*a_y) = (a_x*(1 - s), a_y*(1 - s)) for s >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, the opposite ray of CA is the ray starting at A and going in the direction opposite to CA. The direction vector of CA is from C to A, which is (a_x - c, a_y). So, the opposite direction is (c - a_x, -a_y). Therefore, the parametric equation of the opposite ray of CA is (a_x + s*(c - a_x), a_y - s*a_y) for s >= 0.\n\nNow, BA' is the line from B(0,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y). Its parametric equation is (ta_x, -ta_y) for t >= 0.\n\nWe need to find the intersection point D between BA' and the opposite ray of BA. So, set the parametric equations equal:\n\nta_x = a_x*(1 - s)\n\n-ta_y = a_y*(1 - s)\n\nFrom the first equation: t = (1 - s) (since a_x ≠ 0)\n\nFrom the second equation: -t = (1 - s)*(a_y / a_y) => -t = 1 - s\n\nBut from the first equation, t = 1 - s, so substituting into the second equation: -(1 - s) = 1 - s => -1 + s = 1 - s => 2s = 2 => s = 1\n\nThen, t = 1 - s = 0. So, D is at (0,0), which is point B. But D is supposed to be different from B, so this can't be right. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization of the opposite ray of BA. If the opposite ray starts at A and goes in the direction opposite to BA, which is (-a_x, -a_y), then the parametric equation is (a_x - s*a_x, a_y - s*a_y) = (a_x*(1 - s), a_y*(1 - s)) for s >= 0.\n\nBut BA' is from B(0,0) to A'(a_x, -a_y), so parametric equation is (ta_x, -ta_y) for t >= 0.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nta_x = a_x*(1 - s)\n\n-ta_y = a_y*(1 - s)\n\nFrom the first equation: t = (1 - s) (since a_x ≠ 0)\n\nFrom the second equation: -t = (1 - s)*(a_y / a_y) => -t = 1 - s\n\nBut from the first equation, t = 1 - s, so substituting into the second equation: -(1 - s) = 1 - s => -1 + s = 1 - s => 2s = 2 => s = 1\n\nThen, t = 1 - s = 0, which gives D at (0,0), which is point B. But D is supposed to be different from B, so this suggests that BA' and the opposite ray of BA only intersect at B, which is not allowed. So, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the opposite ray of BA is not starting at A but starting at B and going in the opposite direction of BA. But that would just be the extension of BA beyond A, which would make D coincide with A, but the problem says D is different from B and C, so maybe D is beyond A on BA extended.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince A' is the reflection of A over BC, then BA' = BA and CA' = CA. Also, angles at B and C are preserved in some way.\n\nNow, CD and BE intersect on the circumcircle k.

Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with inequalities and trying to find minima or maxima, methods like Lagrange multipliers come to mind. But since this is a problem with multiple variables and inequalities, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with constraints. Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others and substitute them into the expression to minimize.\n\nLet me write down the given conditions:\n\n1. \\(xy \\geq 2\\)\n2. \\(zx \\geq 3\\)\n3. \\(yz \\geq 6\\)\n\nAnd the expression to minimize is \\(13x^2 + 10y^2 + 5z^2\\).\n\nSince all variables are positive, I can assume equality in the constraints because the minimum is likely to occur when the inequalities are tight (i.e., when \\(xy = 2\\), \\(zx = 3\\), and \\(yz = 6\\)). So, I'll set up the equations:\n\n1. \\(xy = 2\\)\n2. \\(zx = 3\\)\n3. \\(yz = 6\\)\n\nNow, I have three equations with three variables. Maybe I can solve for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(y = \\frac{2}{x}\\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(z = \\frac{3}{x}\\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(yz = 6\\). Let's substitute \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) from above into this equation.\n\nSo, \\(y \\times z = \\frac{2}{x} \\times \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{6}{x^2}\\). But this is equal to 6, so:\n\n\\(\\frac{6}{x^2} = 6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 6: \\(\\frac{1}{x^2} = 1\\)\n\nSo, \\(x^2 = 1\\), which means \\(x = 1\\) since \\(x\\) is positive.\n\nNow, substitute \\(x = 1\\) back into equations 1 and 2:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(z = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\\)\n\nSo, \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), \\(z = 3\\). Let me check if these satisfy all the original constraints:\n\n1. \\(xy = 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\geq 2\\) ✔️\n2. \\(zx = 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\geq 3\\) ✔️\n3. \\(yz = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\geq 6\\) ✔️\n\nPerfect, they all satisfy the equalities. Now, let's compute the expression \\(13x^2 + 10y^2 + 5z^2\\) with these values.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(13x^2 = 13 \\times 1^2 = 13\\)\n- \\(10y^2 = 10 \\times 2^2 = 10 \\times 4 = 40\\)\n- \\(5z^2 = 5 \\times 3^2 = 5 \\times 9 = 45\\)\n\nAdding them up: \\(13 + 40 + 45 = 98\\)\n\nSo, the value is 98. But wait, is this the minimum? I need to make sure that this is indeed the minimum and that there isn't a smaller value possible.\n\nLet me think. Since we assumed equality in all constraints, and the problem is convex (the expression is a sum of squares, which is convex, and the constraints are linear inequalities, which are also convex), the point where all constraints are tight should give the minimum. So, I think 98 is indeed the minimal value.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if relaxing any of the constraints could lead to a lower value. Suppose, for example, that \\(xy > 2\\), \\(zx > 3\\), or \\(yz > 6\\).

Similarly, if \\(zx\\) is greater than 3, either \\(z\\) or \\(x\\) is larger. If \\(yz\\) is greater than 6, either \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) is larger. So, increasing any of the variables would likely increase the expression \\(13x^2 + 10y^2 + 5z^2\\), which would make the total larger, not smaller.

Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that when you divide a rectangle into squares, you're essentially creating a tiling of the rectangle with squares. Each square is \\(1 \\times 1\\), so the entire area of the rectangle must be equal to the number of squares. That means the area \\(a \\times b\\) must be equal to the number of squares, which is also the number of unit cuts plus one, right? Wait, no, actually, the number of squares is one more than the number of cuts. Because each cut increases the number of pieces by one. So if I have 110 cuts, that would divide the rectangle into 111 squares. So the area \\(a \\times b = 111\\).\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have a rectangle and I make a single cut, I divide it into two pieces. So the number of squares would be the number of cuts plus one. So yes, 110 cuts would result in 111 squares. Therefore, the area of the rectangle must be 111. So \\(a \\times b = 111\\).\n\nBut 111 is a specific number. Let me factorize 111 to find possible integer pairs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(a \\leq b\\). 111 divided by 3 is 37, so 111 factors are 1, 3, 37, and 111. Therefore, the possible rectangles are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\). So these are the only two possibilities since \\(a \\leq b\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"sa dajú rozdeliť na štvorce \\(1 \\times 1\\)\", which translates to \"can be divided into squares of \\(1 \\times 1\\)\". So, does that mean that the entire rectangle is just tiled with 1x1 squares? If that's the case, then any rectangle with integer sides can be divided into 1x1 squares, right? Because you can just place them side by side. So why is the number of cuts important here?\n\nAh, maybe the number of cuts refers to the number of unit-length cuts, which would be the total number of edges drawn when dividing the rectangle into squares. So, in that case, the number of cuts is related to the number of internal edges in the tiling.\n\nWait, so if I have a grid of squares, the number of horizontal cuts would be the number of horizontal lines drawn, and similarly for vertical cuts. Each square requires a certain number of cuts to separate it from its neighbors.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about how many cuts are needed to divide a rectangle into 1x1 squares. If I have a rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\), then to divide it into 1x1 squares, I need to make \\(a-1\\) vertical cuts and \\(b-1\\) horizontal cuts. Each vertical cut is of length \\(b\\), and each horizontal cut is of length \\(a\\). But the problem says \"úsečiek jednotkovej dĺžky\", which translates to \"unit-length cuts\". So each cut is just one unit long.\n\nWait, that's different. So each cut is only one unit long, not the entire length of the side. So, for example, if I have a vertical cut, it's a single unit length, so it would only divide the rectangle one unit deep. Similarly, a horizontal cut is one unit long.\n\nSo, in that case, how does this affect the tiling? If each cut is only one unit long, then each cut can only separate one square from the rest. So, to tile the entire rectangle with 1x1 squares, you would need to make \\(a \\times b - 1\\) cuts, because each cut adds one square. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, if each cut is only one unit long, then each cut can only separate one square from the rest. So, for example, if I have a 2x2 square, to divide it into four 1x1 squares, I would need to make three cuts: two vertical and one horizontal, or vice versa. But each cut is only one unit long. So, in that case, the number of cuts would be equal to the number of squares minus one, which is 3 for a 2x2 square.\n\nBut in our problem, the number of cuts is 110, so the number of squares would be 111. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 111, as I thought earlier. So, the rectangle must be of size \\(a \\times b\\) where \\(a \\times b = 111\\), and \\(a \\leq b\\). So, the possible pairs are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\).\n\nBut wait, is that all? Because 111 is a product of 3 and 37, which are both primes. So, the only possible rectangles are those two. So, the answer should be that the rectangles are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\).\n\nBut let me double-check. If I have a rectangle of size \\(1 \\times 111\\), then to divide it into 1x1 squares, I would need to make 110 cuts, each of length 1, either all vertical or all horizontal. Similarly, for a \\(3 \\times 37\\) rectangle, I would need to make 110 cuts as well. So, both of these rectangles can be divided into 1x1 squares with exactly 110 unit-length cuts.\n\nTherefore, the possible rectangles are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Is there a way to have a different rectangle with more sides? For example, if the rectangle is divided into squares in a more complex way, not just straight lines. But no, because all squares are 1x1, so the entire rectangle must be covered by these squares without overlapping or gaps. Therefore, the only possibilities are the ones where the area is 111, which are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\).\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The rectangles are \\(1 \\times 111\\) and \\(3 \\times 37\\).\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding all rectangles \\(a \\times b\\) with \\(a \\leq b\\) that can be divided into \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares using exactly 110 unit-length cuts. Each cut increases the number of pieces by one, so 110 cuts result in 111 squares. Therefore, the area of the rectangle must be 111. The factor pairs of 111 are (1, 111) and (3, 37). Thus, the possible rectangles are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\times 111} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boxed{3 \\times 37}\n\\]", "answer": "Označme Y a Z postupne stredy strán **CD** a **AB** a **X** priesečník **YZ** s **AA'**.

The condition is that in every 2x2 square that has a black (let's assume black is 1) top-left corner, there must be exactly two 0s and two 1s. The top-left corner of the entire table is black, so the top-left 2x2 square must have two 0s and two 1s. I need to figure out how many different ways I can fill the entire 4x4 table following this rule.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the 4x4 grid. Let me label the rows as 1 to 4 and columns as 1 to 4. The top-left corner is (1,1), which is black. So, the 2x2 squares that have their top-left corner at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) must each have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\nWait, actually, in a 4x4 grid, the top-left 2x2 squares are:\n\n- (1,1) to (2,2)\n- (1,2) to (2,3)\n- (1,3) to (2,4)\n- (2,1) to (3,2)\n- (2,2) to (3,3)\n- (2,3) to (3,4)\n- (3,1) to (4,2)\n- (3,2) to (4,3)\n- (3,3) to (4,4)\n\nBut actually, each 2x2 square starting at (i,j) where i and j go from 1 to 3. So, there are 3x3 = 9 such squares in a 4x4 grid. But the condition is only on those 2x2 squares that have a black top-left corner. Wait, the problem says \"v každom štvorci 2 × 2, ktorý má čierne ľavé horné políčko, sú 2 nuly a 2 jednotky.\" So, every 2x2 square that has a black (1) top-left corner must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nBut in the 4x4 grid, the top-left corners of the 2x2 squares are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). So, all these 2x2 squares must have two 0s and two 1s, but only those that have a black (1) top-left corner. Wait, no, the condition is that in every 2x2 square that has a black top-left corner, there are two 0s and two 1s. So, only the 2x2 squares starting at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) must have two 0s and two 1s. But actually, the top-left corner is always black, so all these 2x2 squares must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"v každom štvorci 2 × 2, ktorý má čierne ľavé horné políčko, sú 2 nuly a 2 jednotky.\" So, only the 2x2 squares that have a black (1) top-left corner must have two 0s and two 1s. So, the 2x2 squares starting at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) must each have two 0s and two 1s. But actually, the top-left corner is always black, so all these 2x2 squares must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nWait, no, the top-left corner is black, but the rest can be either 0 or 1, but each 2x2 square starting with a black must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nSo, the entire grid is 4x4, with the top-left corner being 1. Then, each 2x2 square starting at any position must have two 0s and two 1s, but only those that start with a 1. Wait, no, the condition is that in every 2x2 square that has a black top-left corner, there are two 0s and two 1s. So, all 2x2 squares starting at (i,j) where (i,j) is black must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nBut in the 4x4 grid, the top-left corners of the 2x2 squares are all the cells from (1,1) to (3,3). So, all these 2x2 squares must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nWait, but the top-left corner is black, so (1,1) is 1. Then, the 2x2 square starting at (1,1) must have two 0s and two 1s. Similarly, the 2x2 square starting at (1,2) must have two 0s and two 1s, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a constraint satisfaction problem. Maybe I can model this as a grid where each 2x2 square starting at (i,j) must have exactly two 0s and two 1s, with the top-left corner being 1.\n\nLet me try to represent the grid as variables:\n\nLet me denote the grid as follows:\n\na b c d\n\ne f g h\n\ni j k l\n\nm n o p\n\nSo, rows are 1 to 4, columns 1 to 4.\n\nGiven that a is 1 (top-left corner is black). Then, the 2x2 squares starting at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) must each have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nSo, starting with (1,1):\n\na b\n\ne f\n\nThis 2x2 square must have two 0s and two 1s. Since a is 1, then among b, e, f, one of them must be 0, and the other two can be 0 or 1, but the total in the square must be two 0s and two 1s.\n\nWait, no, the square must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Since a is 1, then in the square, we have a=1, so we need one more 1 and two 0s in the remaining three cells: b, e, f.\n\nWait, no, the square has four cells: a, b, e, f. Since a=1, then among b, e, f, there must be one 1 and two 0s to make the total two 1s and two 0s.\n\nSo, in the first 2x2 square, we have a=1, and among b, e, f, exactly one is 1 and two are 0s.\n\nSimilarly, the next square starting at (1,2):\n\nb c\n\nf g\n\nThis must also have two 0s and two 1s. Since b is part of this square, and b is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous square.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can model this as a grid where each 2x2 square starting at (i,j) must have two 0s and two 1s, with the top-left corner being 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a tiling that satisfies this condition.\n\nWait, maybe the grid can be filled in a checkerboard pattern, but with 0s and 1s arranged such that every 2x2 square has two 0s and two 1s. But the top-left corner is 1, so the checkerboard would start with 1, then 0, 1, 0, etc.\n\nBut let me check: in a 4x4 grid, a checkerboard pattern starting with 1 would look like:\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n0 1 0 1\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n0 1 0 1\n\nNow, let's check the 2x2 squares:\n\nFirst square: 1 0; 0 1 → two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nSecond square: 0 1; 1 0 → same.\n\nThird square: 1 0; 0 1 → same.\n\nSimilarly, moving to the next row:\n\n0 1; 1 0 → same.\n\nAnd so on. So, this seems to satisfy the condition. But is this the only way?\n\nWait, no, because the problem allows for different arrangements as long as each 2x2 square starting with a 1 has two 0s and two 1s. So, maybe there are multiple such patterns.\n\nWait, but in the checkerboard pattern, every 2x2 square has two 0s and two 1s, so that's one valid configuration. But are there others?\n\nLet me try to see. Suppose I have a different arrangement. For example, in the first row, after 1, maybe I have two 0s and then a 1. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 2: ?\n\nBut then, the 2x2 square starting at (1,1) would be:\n\n1 0\n\n? ?\n\nWe need two 0s and two 1s. Since a=1, then in the square, we need one more 1 and two 0s. So, in the first row, after 1, if I have 0, then in the second row, first two cells, one must be 1 and the other 0.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model this as a system of equations or use recursion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid configurations is 2^3 = 8, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since each 2x2 square must have two 0s and two 1s, and the top-left corner is 1, maybe the grid is determined by the choices in certain positions, leading to a limited number of possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid can be filled in a way that each row alternates between 1 and 0, but shifted appropriately.\n\nWait, let me try to construct such a grid.\n\nOption 1: Checkerboard starting with 1.\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n0 1 0 1\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n0 1 0 1\n\nThis works, as each 2x2 square has two 0s and two 1s.\n\nOption 2: Another possible arrangement.\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n0 0 1 1\n\nWait, let's check the 2x2 squares.\n\nStarting at (1,1):\n\n1 1\n\n1 1 → four 1s. That's invalid, as we need two 0s and two 1s.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nOption 3: Maybe a different pattern.\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\nLet me check the 2x2 squares.\n\nStarting at (1,1):\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nStarting at (1,2):\n\n0 0\n\n1 1 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nStarting at (1,3):\n\n0 1\n\n1 0 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nStarting at (2,1):\n\n0 1\n\n0 1 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nStarting at (2,2):\n\n1 1\n\n1 0 → Wait, this has three 1s and one 0. That's invalid.\n\nSo, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's consider that each 2x2 square must have two 0s and two 1s, and the top-left corner is 1. So, in each 2x2 square, the top-left is 1, so the remaining three cells must have one 1 and two 0s.\n\nWait, no, the total is two 0s and two 1s, so if the top-left is 1, then the remaining three cells must have one 1 and two 0s.\n\nSo, for each 2x2 square starting at (i,j), cell (i,j)=1, and among (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1), there must be one 1 and two 0s.\n\nThis seems like a constraint that can be modeled as a grid where each cell is determined by its neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to a binary grid with certain constraints, leading to a limited number of configurations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be filled in a way that each row is a shifted version of the previous row, leading to a limited number of possibilities.\n\nWait, let me try to model this step by step.\n\nLet me denote the grid as follows:\n\na b c d\n\ne f g h\n\ni j k l\n\nm n o p\n\nGiven that a=1.\n\nNow, the 2x2 square starting at (1,1):\n\na b\n\ne f\n\nWe have a=1, so among b, e, f, one must be 1 and two must be 0s.\n\nSimilarly, the square starting at (1,2):\n\nb c\n\nf g\n\nHere, b is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous square. If b=0, then in this square, we need one more 1 and two 0s. If b=1, then we need one more 0 and two 1s, but since a=1, maybe this affects the possibilities.\n\nWait, this seems too vague. Maybe I can consider that each 2x2 square imposes constraints on the cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid can be filled in a way that each row is determined by the previous row, leading to a limited number of possibilities.\n\nWait, let me consider that each row must alternate between 1 and 0, but shifted.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 4", "answer": "**Začneme tým, že vyplníme stredový štvorec 2 × 2 požadovaným spôsobom.

Koľko zrkadlitelných čísel existuje?", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem about four-digit numbers called \"zrkadlitelné\" or reversible numbers. The definition says that a four-digit number \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) with non-zero digits is zrkadlitelné if adding nine times a three-digit number made from three identical digits results in the original number. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a four-digit number \\( \\overline{abcd} \\), where none of the digits a, b, c, d are zero. This number is called zrkadlitelné if when we add 9 times some three-digit number, which is formed by three identical digits, we get \\( \\overline{abcd} \\). \n\nSo, mathematically, this can be written as:\n\\[ \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\text{(three-digit number with identical digits)} \\]\n\nWait, hold on. The three-digit number is formed by three identical digits, so it can be 111, 222, ..., up to 999. Let me denote this three-digit number as \\( \\overline{ddd} \\), where d is a digit from 1 to 9. So, \\( \\overline{ddd} = 111 \\times d \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times 111d \\]\n\nBut wait, \\( \\overline{abc} \\) is a three-digit number, which is \\( 100a + 10b + c \\). So substituting that in, we get:\n\\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 100a + 10b + c + 999d \\]\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to group like terms:\n\\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 100a - 10b - c = 999d \\]\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[ (1000a - 100a) + (100b - 10b) + (10c - c) + (d) = 999d \\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 900a + 90b + 9c + d = 999d \\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that as:\n\\[ 900a + 90b + 9c = 999d - d \\]\n\\[ 900a + 90b + 9c = 998d \\]\n\nI can factor out a 9 from the left side:\n\\[ 9(100a + 10b + c) = 998d \\]\n\nSo, \\( 9 \\times \\overline{abc} = 998d \\). Let me write that as:\n\\[ \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998d}{9} \\]\n\nBut \\( \\overline{abc} \\) must be an integer because it's a three-digit number. Therefore, \\( 998d \\) must be divisible by 9. Let me check what 998 is modulo 9. \n\nCalculating 998 divided by 9: 9*110=990, so 998-990=8. So, 998 ≡ 8 mod 9. Therefore, 998d ≡ 8d mod 9. For 998d to be divisible by 9, 8d must be ≡ 0 mod 9. So, 8d ≡ 0 mod 9.\n\nSince 8 and 9 are coprime, this implies that d must be ≡ 0 mod 9. But d is a digit from 1 to 9, so the only possibility is d=9.\n\nSo, d=9. Therefore, substituting back, we have:\n\\[ \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998 \\times 9}{9} = 998 \\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\( \\overline{abc} \\) is a three-digit number, but 998 is a three-digit number. So, \\( \\overline{abc} = 998 \\). Therefore, the four-digit number \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is 9989.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this satisfies the original condition. Let's compute \\( \\overline{abcd} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\). Here, \\( \\overline{abcd} = 9989 \\) and \\( \\overline{ddd} = 999 \\). So, 9989 + 9*999 = 9989 + 8991 = 18980. Wait, that's a five-digit number, but the original number is four-digit. That can't be right. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me go back.\n\nThe original equation was:\n\\[ \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\]\n\nBut \\( \\overline{abc} \\) is a three-digit number, so it's 100a + 10b + c. Then, \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So, the equation is:\n\\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = (100a + 10b + c) + 9 \\times 111d \\]\n\nWait, 9 times 111d is 999d, right? So, 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 100a + 10b + c + 999d.\n\nSubtracting 100a + 10b + c from both sides:\n900a + 90b + 9c + d = 999d\n\nThen, moving d to the right:\n900a + 90b + 9c = 998d\n\nSo, 9(100a + 10b + c) = 998d\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998d}{9} \\). So, 998d must be divisible by 9, which as before, requires d=9.\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998*9}{9} = 998 \\). So, the four-digit number is 9989.\n\nBut when I checked, 9989 + 9*999 = 9989 + 8991 = 18980, which is five digits. That's a problem because the original number is four digits. So, this suggests that 9989 is not a valid zrkadlitelné number because adding 9*999 gives a five-digit number, which is outside the four-digit range.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nIs the three-digit number \\( \\overline{ddd} \\) necessarily 111*d? Or is it a three-digit number with identical digits, which is 111*d? Yes, that's correct. So, 111*d where d is from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, the equation is correct. Then, why does it lead to a four-digit number that when added to 9999 gives a five-digit number? That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the equation. Let me write it again:\n\n\\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\)\n\nBut \\( \\overline{abc} \\) is a three-digit number, so it's 100a + 10b + c. Then, \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n1000a + 100b + 10c + d = (100a + 10b + c) + 999d\n\nSubtracting (100a + 10b + c) from both sides:\n900a + 90b + 9c + d = 999d\n\nThen, moving d to the right:\n900a + 90b + 9c = 998d\n\nSo, 9(100a + 10b + c) = 998d\n\nTherefore, \\( \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998d}{9} \\)\n\nSo, 998d must be divisible by 9, which as before, requires d=9.\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abc} = 998 \\), so the four-digit number is 9989.\n\nBut when I plug it back in, 9989 + 9*999 = 9989 + 8991 = 18980, which is five digits. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so maybe the four-digit number is not 9989, but something else? Or perhaps my initial equation is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the three-digit number is not 111*d, but a three-digit number with identical digits, which is 111*d, but maybe d is a digit, so 111*d is 111, 222, ..., 999. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but if \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\), then \\( \\overline{abcd} \\) must be greater than \\( \\overline{abc} \\), which it is, but in this case, it's 9989, which is greater than 998, but when we add 999*9=8991, it's way larger.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the equation. Let me think: the four-digit number is equal to the three-digit number plus 9 times the three-digit number with identical digits. So, \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\). So, \\( \\overline{abcd} - \\overline{abc} = 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\). So, the difference between the four-digit number and the three-digit number is 9 times a three-digit repdigit.\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abcd} - \\overline{abc} = d \\times 111 \\times 9 = 999d \\). So, \\( \\overline{abcd} - \\overline{abc} = 999d \\).\n\nBut \\( \\overline{abcd} - \\overline{abc} = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - (100a + 10b + c) = 900a + 90b + 9c + d \\). So, 900a + 90b + 9c + d = 999d.\n\nSo, 900a + 90b + 9c = 998d.\n\nSo, 9(100a + 10b + c) = 998d.\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998d}{9} \\). So, 998d must be divisible by 9, which as before, requires d=9.\n\nSo, \\( \\overline{abc} = 998 \\), so the four-digit number is 9989.\n\nBut when I plug it back in, 9989 - 998 = 8991, which is 999*9. So, 8991 = 999*9, which is correct. So, 9989 is indeed a zrkadlitelné number.\n\nBut when I add 9989 and 8991, I get 18980, which is a five-digit number. Wait, but the original number is 9989, which is four-digit. So, why is the sum five-digit? That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no, the original equation is \\( \\overline{abcd} = \\overline{abc} + 9 \\times \\overline{ddd} \\). So, 9989 = 998 + 9*999. So, 998 + 8991 = 9989. So, that's correct. So, 9989 is equal to 998 + 8991, which is 9989. So, that works.\n\nBut when I think about it, 9989 is a four-digit number, and 8991 is a four-digit number as well, but 9989 is the result of adding 998 and 8991. So, 998 is a three-digit number, 8991 is a four-digit number, and their sum is 9989, which is a four-digit number. So, that works.\n\nSo, 9989 is a valid zrkadlitelné number. But is it the only one?\n\nWait, let's see. From the equation, we have \\( \\overline{abc} = \\frac{998d}{9} \\). Since d=9, \\( \\overline{abc} = 998 \\). So, that's the only possibility because d must be 9 for divisibility by 9.\n\nTherefore, the only four-digit zrkadlitelné number is 9989. So, the count is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other possibilities. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming d must be 9. Let me double-check.\n\nWe had 8d ≡ 0 mod 9, so 8d must be divisible by 9.

The equations are:\n\n1. \\(2x + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 2022\\)\n2. \\(3y + \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2023\\)\n\nHmm, floor functions can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(\\lfloor a \\rfloor\\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(a\\). So, for any real number \\(a\\), \\(\\lfloor a \\rfloor\\) is the integer part of \\(a\\), essentially chopping off everything after the decimal point. For example, \\(\\lfloor 1.9 \\rfloor = 1\\) and \\(\\lfloor -1.1 \\rfloor = -2\\).\n\nLooking at the first equation: \\(2x + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 2022\\). Let me denote \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor\\) as an integer, say \\(k\\). So, \\(k\\) is an integer such that \\(k \\leq y < k + 1\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(2x + k = 2022\\)\n\nWhich I can rearrange to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\(2x = 2022 - k\\)\n\n\\(x = \\frac{2022 - k}{2}\\)\n\nSo, \\(x\\) is expressed in terms of \\(k\\). Now, let's look at the second equation: \\(3y + \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 2023\\). Let me denote \\(\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor\\) as another integer, say \\(m\\). So, \\(m\\) is an integer such that \\(m \\leq 2x < m + 1\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(3y + m = 2023\\)\n\nSolving for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(3y = 2023 - m\\)\n\n\\(y = \\frac{2023 - m}{3}\\)\n\nSo, now I have expressions for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of integers \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But I also know that \\(k = \\lfloor y \\rfloor\\) and \\(m = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor\\). So, I need to relate \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) together.\n\nLet me substitute the expression for \\(x\\) into the expression for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2x = 2022 - k\\), so \\(m = \\lfloor 2022 - k \\rfloor\\). But since \\(2022 - k\\) is already an integer (because \\(k\\) is an integer), the floor of it is just \\(2022 - k\\). So, \\(m = 2022 - k\\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, \\(m = 2022 - k\\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\(m = 2022 - k\\)\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the expression for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(y = \\frac{2023 - m}{3} = \\frac{2023 - (2022 - k)}{3} = \\frac{2023 - 2022 + k}{3} = \\frac{1 + k}{3}\\)\n\nSo, \\(y = \\frac{1 + k}{3}\\). But remember that \\(k = \\lfloor y \\rfloor\\). So, \\(k\\) is the floor of \\(y\\), which is the integer part of \\(y\\). Therefore, \\(k \\leq y < k + 1\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(y = \\frac{1 + k}{3}\\) into this inequality:\n\n\\(k \\leq \\frac{1 + k}{3} < k + 1\\)\n\nLet me solve this inequality for \\(k\\). First, let's split it into two parts:\n\n1. \\(k \\leq \\frac{1 + k}{3}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1 + k}{3} < k + 1\\)\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\n\\(k \\leq \\frac{1 + k}{3}\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\(3k \\leq 1 + k\\)\n\nSubtract \\(k\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(2k \\leq 1\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\(k \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nSince \\(k\\) is an integer, this implies \\(k \\leq 0\\).\n\nNow, the second inequality:\n\n\\(\\frac{1 + k}{3} < k + 1\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\(1 + k < 3k + 3\\)\n\nSubtract \\(k\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(1 < 2k + 3\\)\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2 < 2k\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\(-1 < k\\)\n\nSo, combining both inequalities:\n\n\\(-1 < k \\leq 0\\)\n\nSince \\(k\\) is an integer, the possible values for \\(k\\) are \\(k = 0\\) or \\(k = -1\\).\n\nLet me check each case.\n\n**Case 1: \\(k = 0\\)**\n\nIf \\(k = 0\\), then from the first equation:\n\n\\(2x + 0 = 2022\\)\n\nSo, \\(2x = 2022\\) which gives \\(x = 1011\\).\n\nThen, from \\(y = \\frac{1 + k}{3} = \\frac{1 + 0}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies the conditions.\n\nFirst, check \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = k\\). Since \\(y = \\frac{1}{3}\\), which is approximately 0.333..., so \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 0\\), which matches \\(k = 0\\).\n\nNext, check \\(\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = m\\). Since \\(x = 1011\\), \\(2x = 2022\\), so \\(\\lfloor 2022 \\rfloor = 2022\\). From earlier, \\(m = 2022 - k = 2022 - 0 = 2022\\), which matches.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation:\n\n\\(3y + \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 3*(1/3) + 2022 = 1 + 2022 = 2023\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, \\(k = 0\\) gives a valid solution: \\(x = 1011\\), \\(y = 1/3\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(k = -1\\)**\n\nIf \\(k = -1\\), then from the first equation:\n\n\\(2x + (-1) = 2022\\)\n\nSo, \\(2x = 2023\\), which gives \\(x = 2023/2 = 1011.5\\).\n\nThen, from \\(y = \\frac{1 + k}{3} = \\frac{1 + (-1)}{3} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's check the conditions.\n\nFirst, \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0 \\rfloor = 0\\), but \\(k = -1\\). This is a problem because \\(k\\) was supposed to be \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor\\), but here \\(k = -1\\) while \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 0\\). So, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, \\(k = -1\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nIf \\(k = -1\\), then \\(y = \\frac{1 + (-1)}{3} = 0\\). So, \\(y = 0\\). Then, \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0 \\rfloor = 0\\), but \\(k = -1\\). So, indeed, \\(k\\) is not equal to \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor\\), which is 0. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n\nSo, only \\(k = 0\\) gives a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution is \\(x = 1011\\) and \\(y = 1/3\\).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that \\(y = 1/3\\) satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: \\(2x + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 2*1011 + \\lfloor 1/3 \\rfloor = 2022 + 0 = 2022\\). Correct.\n\nSecond equation: \\(3y + \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor = 3*(1/3) + \\lfloor 2022 \\rfloor = 1 + 2022 = 2023\\). Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that works.\n\nIs there any other possible \\(k\\)? Earlier, we found that \\(k\\) must be between -1 and 0, inclusive, but since \\(k\\) is integer, only 0 and -1. But -1 doesn't work, so only 0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\(x = 1011\\) and \\(y = 1/3\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that \\(k\\) could be another integer? For example, if \\(k = 1\\), but earlier we saw that \\(k \\leq 0\\). So, no, \\(k\\) can't be 1.\n\nAlternatively, could \\(k\\) be a non-integer? No, because \\(k = \\lfloor y \\rfloor\\), which is always an integer.\n\nSo, I think that's the only solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\(\\boxed{x = 1011}\\) and \\(\\boxed{y = \\dfrac{1}{3}}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says to return the answer in a single boxed format. Maybe I should present both x and y together.\n\nSo, the solution is \\(x = 1011\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\). So, in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 1011}, \\quad \\boxed{y = \\dfrac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\nBut the instructions say to return the answer in \\boxed{} format. Maybe I should write both in one box.

On the table, for every pair of numbers i and j where 1 ≤ i ≤ k and 1 ≤ j ≤ n, there's a fraction i/j written. I need to find a real number q such that when all these fractions are sorted from smallest to largest, the one in the middle (the median) is q.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I should figure out how many fractions there are in total. Since i can be any number from 1 to k and j from 1 to n, the total number of fractions is k multiplied by n, so k*n.\n\nSince k and n are both odd, their product k*n is also odd. That means when we sort all the fractions, there will be an odd number of them, so the median will be the exact middle one. Specifically, the median will be the (k*n + 1)/2-th fraction in the sorted list.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what fraction q is at this position. To do that, I should think about how the fractions are distributed. Fractions can be less than 1, equal to 1, or greater than 1, depending on whether i is less than, equal to, or greater than j.\n\nBut wait, since both k and n are odd, maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me consider the case where k = n first, just to simplify things. If k = n, then the number of fractions less than 1 would be the number of pairs where i < j, which is (k*(k-1))/2. Similarly, the number of fractions equal to 1 is just k, since i = j. And the number of fractions greater than 1 is also (k*(k-1))/2.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of fractions is k^2, which is odd. The median would be the ((k^2 + 1)/2)-th fraction. If k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then the median would be at position ( (2m+1)^2 + 1 ) / 2 = (4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 1)/2 = (4m^2 + 4m + 2)/2 = 2m^2 + 2m + 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the fractions in terms of their values. The smallest fractions are 1/n, 2/n, ..., (n-1)/n, 1, 2, ..., k. But that might not be the right way to order them. Actually, the fractions can be anywhere between 0 and k, but more precisely, between 1/n and k.\n\nBut ordering them is tricky because for each j, the fractions i/j increase as i increases, and for each i, the fractions i/j decrease as j increases. So, the fractions are spread out in a grid, and we need to find the median.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the median is often around the geometric mean or something similar, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the number of fractions less than or equal to a certain value q.\n\nLet me denote the number of fractions less than or equal to q as F(q). Then, the median q is the smallest q such that F(q) ≥ (k*n + 1)/2.\n\nSo, I need to find q where F(q) is just enough to cover half of the total fractions.\n\nBut how do I compute F(q)? For each j, the number of i's such that i/j ≤ q is floor(q*j). So, for each j from 1 to n, the number of i's is floor(q*j). Therefore, F(q) = sum_{j=1}^n floor(q*j).\n\nWe need F(q) = (k*n + 1)/2.\n\nSo, we need to solve for q in the equation sum_{j=1}^n floor(q*j) = (k*n + 1)/2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can approximate it. If q is such that q*j is not an integer, then floor(q*j) is approximately q*j - 0.5. So, sum_{j=1}^n floor(q*j) ≈ q*sum_{j=1}^n j - 0.5*n.\n\nSum_{j=1}^n j is n(n+1)/2, so approximately q*(n(n+1)/2) - 0.5n.\n\nSet this equal to (k*n + 1)/2:\n\nq*(n(n+1)/2) - 0.5n ≈ (k*n + 1)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nq*n(n+1) - n ≈ k*n + 1\n\nThen, q*n(n+1) ≈ k*n + 1 + n\n\nSo, q ≈ (k*n + n + 1)/(n(n+1)) = (k + 1 + 1/n)/(n+1)\n\nBut since n is a natural number, 1/n is negligible for large n, but since n is odd, maybe it's exact?\n\nWait, let's test with small numbers. Let me take k=1, n=1. Then, the only fraction is 1/1=1. The median is 1. According to the formula, q ≈ (1 + 1 + 1)/(1+1) = 3/2, which is not 1. Hmm, so that approximation is not accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I need a better approach. Let's think about the exact count.\n\nWe have F(q) = sum_{j=1}^n floor(q*j). We need F(q) = (k*n + 1)/2.\n\nBut since k and n are odd, let's denote k = 2a + 1 and n = 2b + 1 for some integers a, b ≥ 0.\n\nThen, total fractions = (2a + 1)(2b + 1). The median position is ((2a + 1)(2b + 1) + 1)/2 = (4ab + 2a + 2b + 1 + 1)/2 = 2ab + a + b + 1.\n\nSo, we need F(q) = 2ab + a + b + 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the fractions. For each j, the number of i's such that i/j ≤ q is floor(q*j). So, sum_{j=1}^{2b+1} floor(q*j) = 2ab + a + b + 1.\n\nI need to find q such that this sum equals 2ab + a + b + 1.\n\nLet me consider q = a + 1. Let's see what F(q) would be.\n\nFor each j, floor((a + 1)*j). Since j can be from 1 to 2b + 1.\n\nIf j ≤ a, then (a + 1)*j = a*j + j. Since j ≤ a, a*j ≤ a^2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of medians. Since k and n are odd, the median is the middle value, which is the ( (k*n + 1)/2 )-th smallest fraction.\n\nBut how do I find this q?\n\nWait, maybe the median is the fraction where i = (k + 1)/2 and j = (n + 1)/2. Because if you take the middle i and middle j, their ratio would be ((k + 1)/2) / ((n + 1)/2) = (k + 1)/(n + 1). But is that the median?\n\nWait, let's test with k=3, n=3. Then, the fractions are:\n\n1/1, 1/2, 1/3,\n\n2/1, 2/2, 2/3,\n\n3/1, 3/2, 3/3.\n\nSo, sorted order: 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2/3, 3/3, 3/2, 2, 3/1, 1.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me list all fractions:\n\n1/1=1, 1/2=0.5, 1/3≈0.333,\n\n2/1=2, 2/2=1, 2/3≈0.666,\n\n3/1=3, 3/2=1.5, 3/3=1.\n\nSo, sorted: 1/3≈0.333, 1/2=0.5, 1/1=1, 2/3≈0.666, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 3/1=3.\n\nWait, that's 9 fractions. The median is the 5th one, which is 1. So, q=1.\n\nBut according to the formula (k + 1)/(n + 1) = (3 + 1)/(3 + 1) = 1, which matches.\n\nAnother test: k=1, n=1. Then, only 1/1=1. Median is 1, which is (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)=1. So that works.\n\nAnother test: k=5, n=3.\n\nTotal fractions: 15. Median is 8th fraction.\n\nLet me list all fractions:\n\ni=1: 1/1=1, 1/2=0.5, 1/3≈0.333\n\ni=2: 2/1=2, 2/2=1, 2/3≈0.666\n\ni=3: 3/1=3, 3/2=1.5, 3/3=1\n\ni=4: 4/1=4, 4/2=2, 4/3≈1.333\n\ni=5: 5/1=5, 5/2=2.5, 5/3≈1.666\n\nNow, let's sort them:\n\n0.333, 0.5, 0.666, 1, 1, 1, 1.333, 1.5, 1.666, 2, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWait, that's 15 fractions. The 8th one is 1.5.\n\nNow, according to the formula (k + 1)/(n + 1) = (5 + 1)/(3 + 1) = 6/4 = 1.5. So, that matches.\n\nAnother test: k=3, n=5.\n\nTotal fractions: 15.

So, that matches.\n\nSo, it seems that the median q is (k + 1)/(n + 1).\n\nWait, but in the first test case where k=1, n=1, it's 1, which is (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test: k=5, n=5.\n\nTotal fractions:25. Median is 13th.\n\nAccording to the formula, q=(5 + 1)/(5 + 1)=1.\n\nLet me see if the 13th fraction is 1.\n\nList of fractions:\n\ni=1: 1, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25, 0.2\n\ni=2: 2, 1, 0.666, 0.5, 0.4\n\ni=3: 3, 1.5, 1, 0.75, 0.6\n\ni=4: 4, 2, 1.333, 1, 0.8\n\ni=5: 5, 2.5, 1.666, 1.25, 1\n\nNow, sorted list:\n\n0.2, 0.25, 0.333, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.666, 0.75, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.25, 1.333, 1.5, 1.666, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWait, that's 25 fractions. The 13th is 1. So, q=1, which is (5 + 1)/(5 + 1)=1. Correct.\n\nSo, it seems that the median is always (k + 1)/(n + 1). That seems to hold in all test cases.\n\nTherefore, the real number q is (k + 1)/(n + 1).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe real number \\( q \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{k + 1}{n + 1}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven two odd natural numbers \\( k \\) and \\( n \\), we need to determine the real number \\( q \\) such that when all fractions \\(\\frac{i}{j}\\) for \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\) and \\(1 \\leq j \\leq n\\) are sorted in ascending order, the median fraction is \\( q \\).\n\nFirst, we note that the total number of fractions is \\( k \\times n \\).

A quadratic equation has a double root if its discriminant is zero. So, for each equation, I need to compute the discriminant and set it equal to zero. Then, solve the resulting system of equations for a and b.\n\nFirst, let me simplify both equations.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( a(x^2 + ax + b) + b(x^2 + bx + a) = 0 \\)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n\\( a x^2 + a^2 x + a b + b x^2 + b^2 x + a b = 0 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( a x^2 + b x^2 = (a + b) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( a^2 x + b^2 x = (a^2 + b^2) x \\)\n- The constant terms: \\( a b + a b = 2 a b \\)\n\nSo, the first equation simplifies to:\n\n\\( (a + b) x^2 + (a^2 + b^2) x + 2 a b = 0 \\)\n\nSimilarly, let's simplify the second equation:\n\n\\( a(x^2 + bx + a) + b(x^2 + ax + b) = 0 \\)\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\( a x^2 + a b x + a^2 + b x^2 + a b x + b^2 = 0 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( a x^2 + b x^2 = (a + b) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( a b x + a b x = 2 a b x \\)\n- The constant terms: \\( a^2 + b^2 \\)\n\nSo, the second equation simplifies to:\n\n\\( (a + b) x^2 + 2 a b x + (a^2 + b^2) = 0 \\)\n\nAlright, so now both equations are simplified. Let me write them again:\n\n1. \\( (a + b) x^2 + (a^2 + b^2) x + 2 a b = 0 \\)  -- Equation (1)\n2. \\( (a + b) x^2 + 2 a b x + (a^2 + b^2) = 0 \\)  -- Equation (2)\n\nNow, for each quadratic equation, the discriminant must be zero. Let's recall that for a quadratic equation \\( p x^2 + q x + r = 0 \\), the discriminant is \\( D = q^2 - 4 p r \\).

Let me see if a = b is a root.\n\nPlug a = b into the equation:\n\n\\( b^3 + (-b^2 + b) b^2 + b^2 * b + b^3 = b^3 + (-b^4 + b^3) + b^3 + b^3 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b^3 - b^4 + b^3 + b^3 + b^3 = -b^4 + 4 b^3 \\)\n\nWhich is not zero unless b = 0 or b = 4.

Coefficient of a^3: 1 = 1, okay.\n2. Coefficient of a^2: n + m b = -b^2 + b\n3. Coefficient of a: p + m n b = b^2\n4. Constant term: m p b^2 = b^3\n\nFrom the constant term: m p b^2 = b^3. Assuming b ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by b^2:\n\nm p = b\n\nFrom the coefficient of a: p + m n b = b^2\n\nFrom the coefficient of a^2: n + m b = -b^2 + b\n\nSo, let's write these equations:\n\nEquation 1: n + m b = -b^2 + b\n\nEquation 2: p + m n b = b^2\n\nEquation 3: m p = b\n\nWe have three equations with variables m, n, p.\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nFrom Equation 3: p = b / m\n\nPlug p into Equation 2:\n\n(b / m) + m n b = b^2\n\nDivide both sides by b (assuming b ≠ 0):\n\n(1 / m) + m n = b\n\nSo, Equation 2 becomes: (1/m) + m n = b\n\nFrom Equation 1: n = -b^2 + b - m b\n\nSo, substitute n into Equation 2:\n\n(1/m) + m*(-b^2 + b - m b) = b\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/m + (-b^2 m + b m - m^2 b) = b\n\nMultiply through by m to eliminate the denominator:\n\n1 + (-b^2 m^2 + b m^2 - m^3 b) = b m\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1 - b^2 m^2 + b m^2 - m^3 b - b m = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe try specific values for m.\n\nLet me assume m = 1.\n\nThen, from Equation 3: p = b / 1 = b\n\nFrom Equation 1: n + 1*b = -b^2 + b => n = -b^2 + b - b = -b^2\n\nFrom Equation 2: p + m n b = b => b + 1*(-b^2)*b = b => b - b^3 = b\n\nSo, b - b^3 = b => -b^3 = 0 => b = 0\n\nBut if b = 0, then m = 1, p = 0, n = 0\n\nSo, the factorization would be (a + 1*0)(a^2 + 0 a + 0) = a*(a^2) = a^3, but the original polynomial is a^3 + ...

Let me try to understand it step by step. The game starts with k kôpok, each containing a number of žetónov equal to their position in the sequence. So, the first kôpka has 1 žetón, the second has 2, up to the k-th kôpka which has k žetónov. \n\nThe goal is to perform a series of moves where in each move, I pick any two kôpok and remove the same number of žetónov from both. The aim is to end up with just one žetón left on the entire table. The question is whether this is possible for k = 10 and k = 11.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the total number of žetónov is initially. For k kôpoks, the total is the sum from 1 to k. The formula for that is (k(k + 1))/2. So, for k = 10, the total is (10*11)/2 = 55. For k = 11, it's (11*12)/2 = 66.\n\nNow, each move involves removing an equal number of žetónov from two different kôpoks. Let's denote the number of žetónov removed from each kôpka as x. So, each move reduces the total number of žetónov by 2x. \n\nThe key here is to see if we can manipulate the total number of žetónov down to 1 through such moves. Since each move reduces the total by an even number (2x), the parity (whether the total is odd or even) remains the same. \n\nLet's check the parity for both cases:\n\n- For k = 10: Total is 55, which is odd.\n- For k = 11: Total is 66, which is even.\n\nSince each move changes the total by an even number, the parity of the total remains the same. To end up with 1 žetón, which is odd, the initial total must also be odd. Therefore, for k = 10, it's possible because the total is odd. For k = 11, the total is even, so it's impossible to end up with 1 (which is odd).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The parity argument is crucial here. Each move subtracts an even number, so the parity doesn't change. Since we start with an odd total for k=10, we can potentially reach 1. For k=11, starting with even, we can't reach 1.\n\nIs there any other factor I'm missing? Maybe the structure of the kôpoks? Each move affects two kôpoks, but as long as the total parity allows it, it should be possible. So, I think the parity is the main factor here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that it's possible for k=10 and impossible for k=11.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves determining whether it's possible to reduce k kôpoks, each containing 1, 2, ..., k žetónov respectively, to a single žetón through moves where an equal number of žetónov are removed from two kôpoks. \n\nThe total number of žetónov initially is the sum from 1 to k, which is (k(k + 1))/2. Each move reduces the total by an even number, preserving the parity. Since 1 is odd, the initial total must also be odd for it to be achievable. \n\n- For k = 10, the total is 55 (odd), so it's possible.\n- For k = 11, the total is 66 (even), so it's impossible.\n\n**Answer:**\n\na) \\boxed{10}\n\nb) \\boxed{11}", "answer": "**a)** Počty žetónov na kôpkach popíšeme desiaticou, ktorú nazveme konfigurácia.

", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest natural number \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\geq 10 \\). The condition is that for any 10 distinct numbers chosen from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\), if none of them are prime numbers, then the sum of some two of them must also be a prime number. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. We're looking for the maximum \\( n \\) where the following holds: any 10 distinct numbers from 1 to \\( n \\), if none are prime, must have at least two numbers whose sum is prime. So, if I can find such an \\( n \\), but beyond that, there exists a set of 10 composite numbers where no two sum to a prime, then \\( n \\) is the answer.\n\nLet me think about composite numbers. Composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that aren't prime, so they have factors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest composite number is 4, then 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.\n\nNow, the key is that if I have 10 composite numbers, their sums should include at least one prime. So, I need to ensure that in any such set of 10 composites, there's at least one pair that adds up to a prime.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if none of the 10 numbers are prime, then the sum of some two is prime. So, if I can find a set of 10 composite numbers where all pairwise sums are composite, then \\( n \\) must be less than the smallest such number. Therefore, the largest \\( n \\) where this condition holds is just before such a set exists.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal \\( n \\) such that there exists a set of 10 composite numbers from 1 to \\( n \\) where all pairwise sums are composite. Then, the answer would be \\( n - 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if I can find the minimal \\( n \\) where such a set exists, then the maximum \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is one less than that.\n\nSo, how do I find such a set? Let's think about composite numbers and their properties.\n\nComposite numbers can be even or odd. Let's recall that the sum of two even numbers is even, the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an even and an odd number is odd.\n\nSince primes (except 2) are odd, the only even prime is 2. So, if I have two even composite numbers, their sum is even and greater than 2, so it's composite. Similarly, if I have two odd composite numbers, their sum is even, so it's composite unless it's 2, but since the numbers are at least 4, their sum is at least 8, which is composite.\n\nWait, so if I have a set of composite numbers that are all even, then any two of them will sum to an even number greater than 2, hence composite. Similarly, if I have a set of composite numbers that are all odd, then any two will sum to an even number, which is composite.\n\nBut wait, hold on. If I have a set of 10 composite numbers, all even, then their sums are even and composite. Similarly, if I have all odd composites, their sums are even and composite. So, in both cases, the condition is satisfied because the sum is composite.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if none of the 10 numbers are prime, then the sum of some two is prime. So, if I can find a set of 10 composite numbers where all pairwise sums are composite, then \\( n \\) must be less than the smallest such number.\n\nBut wait, if all pairwise sums are composite, then the condition fails because the statement is \"if none are prime, then some two sum to prime.\" So, if all sums are composite, then the condition is violated. Therefore, the maximum \\( n \\) is the smallest \\( n \\) where such a set exists minus one.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal \\( n \\) such that there exists a set of 10 composite numbers from 1 to \\( n \\) where all pairwise sums are composite. Then, the answer is \\( n - 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if I can't find such a set, then \\( n \\) can be as large as possible. But I think such a set exists, so I need to find the minimal \\( n \\) where this is possible.\n\nLet me try to construct such a set. Let's consider even composite numbers. The even composite numbers start from 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. If I take 10 even composite numbers, their pairwise sums will be even and greater than 2, hence composite. So, for example, if I take the first 10 even composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22. Then, any two of these numbers will sum to an even number greater than 2, so all sums are composite.\n\nTherefore, if \\( n \\) is at least 22, then such a set exists. So, the minimal \\( n \\) where this is possible is 22. Therefore, the maximum \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is 21.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if 22 is indeed the minimal \\( n \\). Let's see, if \\( n = 21 \\), can I have 10 composite numbers where all pairwise sums are composite?\n\nWait, 21 is odd. The composite numbers up to 21 are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21.\n\nSo, from 1 to 21, there are 12 composite numbers. Let's try to pick 10 of them such that all pairwise sums are composite.\n\nBut wait, if I pick all even composites: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. That's 9 numbers. I need one more. The next even composite is 22, but 22 is beyond 21. So, in 1 to 21, the even composites are only up to 20. So, I can only get 9 even composites. Then, to get 10, I need to include an odd composite.\n\nBut if I include an odd composite, say 9, then 9 + 4 = 13, which is prime. So, that would violate the condition because the sum is prime. Similarly, 9 + 6 = 15, which is composite. 9 + 8 = 17, which is prime. So, including 9 would cause some sums to be prime.\n\nSimilarly, if I include 15: 15 + 4 = 19 (prime), 15 + 6 = 21 (composite), 15 + 8 = 23 (prime). So, again, some sums would be prime.\n\nSimilarly, 21: 21 + 4 = 25 (composite), 21 + 6 = 27 (composite), 21 + 8 = 29 (prime). So, again, 21 + 8 is prime.\n\nSo, if I include any odd composite in the set, adding it to some even composite will result in a prime. Therefore, in 1 to 21, it's impossible to have 10 composite numbers where all pairwise sums are composite. Because any 10 composites would have to include at least one odd composite, which when added to an even composite, would result in a prime.\n\nTherefore, \\( n = 21 \\) is the maximum where the condition holds. Because for \\( n = 22 \\), we can have 10 even composites (4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22), and all their pairwise sums are even and greater than 2, hence composite. So, the condition fails for \\( n = 22 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( n = 21 \\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is 22 the minimal \\( n \\) where such a set exists? Let's see, in 1 to 22, the even composites are 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22. That's 10 numbers. So, yes, 22 is the minimal \\( n \\) where such a set exists. Therefore, the maximum \\( n \\) where the condition holds is 21.\n\nBut hold on, is there another set of 10 composite numbers in 1 to 21 where all pairwise sums are composite? Maybe not all even, but a mix of even and odd composites where their sums are composite.\n\nWait, let's try. Let's see, in 1 to 21, the composite numbers are: 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21.\n\nSo, 12 composite numbers. Let's try to pick 10 such that all pairwise sums are composite.\n\nIf I pick all even composites: 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 9 numbers. I need one more. Let's try adding 21.\n\nBut 21 is odd. So, 21 + 4 = 25 (composite), 21 + 6 = 27 (composite), 21 + 8 = 29 (prime). So, 21 + 8 is prime, which is bad.\n\nWhat if I add 15 instead? 15 + 4 = 19 (prime), 15 + 6 = 21 (composite), 15 + 8 = 23 (prime). So, again, primes.\n\nWhat about 9? 9 + 4 = 13 (prime), 9 + 6 = 15 (composite), 9 + 8 = 17 (prime). So, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not all even. Maybe include some odd composites but carefully.\n\nSuppose I pick 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20, and 22. But 22 is beyond 21, so in 1 to 21, I can't include 22. So, I have to pick 10 composites from 1 to 21.\n\nWait, maybe if I pick all even composites except one, and include another even composite. Wait, but all even composites are 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 9. So, to get 10, I have to include one more, which would have to be an odd composite, but as we saw, adding any odd composite would result in a prime when added to some even composite.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have 10 composite numbers in 1 to 21 where all pairwise sums are composite. Therefore, \\( n = 21 \\) is indeed the maximum where the condition holds.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's another way to pick 10 composite numbers without including both even and odd composites? But all composite numbers are either even or odd. So, if I pick all even composites, I can only get 9 in 1 to 21. So, I have to include an odd composite, which causes the problem.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to pick 10 composite numbers all of which are odd? Let's see, the odd composite numbers up to 21 are: 9,15,21. Only 3. So, not enough. So, I can't have 10 odd composites.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have 10 composite numbers in 1 to 21 where all pairwise sums are composite. Therefore, \\( n = 21 \\) is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check for \\( n = 20 \\). In 1 to 20, the composite numbers are: 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20. So, 11 composite numbers. Let's see if I can pick 10 of them where all pairwise sums are composite.\n\nIf I pick all even composites: 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 9. I need one more. Let's try adding 9.\n\nBut 9 + 4 = 13 (prime). So, that's bad. What about adding 15? 15 + 4 = 19 (prime). 15 + 6 = 21 (composite). 15 + 8 = 23 (prime). So, again, primes.\n\nAdding 21 is beyond 20. So, same problem. So, in 1 to 20, it's also impossible to have 10 composite numbers with all pairwise sums composite.\n\nWait, but 20 is less than 21, so if 21 is the minimal \\( n \\) where such a set exists, then 20 is still okay. So, the answer is 21.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a different set of 10 composite numbers in 1 to 21 where all pairwise sums are composite. Maybe not all even or all odd.\n\nWait, let's try to construct such a set. Let's see, if I take 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20, and 22. But 22 is beyond 21. So, in 1 to 21, I can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take some higher composites. Let's see, 25 is composite, but 25 is beyond 21. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe if I take all composite numbers greater than 10. Let's see, in 1 to 21, composite numbers greater than 10 are: 12,14,15,16,18,20,21. That's 7 numbers. So, not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take some composites that are spaced out so that their sums are composite. For example, take 4,6,8,9,15,21.

The condition is that the sum of each row must be divisible by 5, and the sum of each column must be divisible by 7. I need to do this for n = 9 and n = 12. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. For each row, the sum has to be a multiple of 5. Since each cell is either 1 or 2, the sum of a row with n cells will be somewhere between n (if all are 1s) and 2n (if all are 2s). Similarly, for each column, the sum must be a multiple of 7, so it's between n and 2n as well.\n\nLet me start with part a) where n = 9.\n\nFor n = 9, each row has 9 cells. The sum of each row must be divisible by 5. So, possible sums for each row are 5, 10, 15, etc. But since each cell is 1 or 2, the minimum sum is 9 (all 1s) and the maximum is 18 (all 2s). So, the possible row sums are 10 and 15 because 5 is less than 9, and 20 is more than 18. So, each row must sum to either 10 or 15.\n\nSimilarly, for each column, the sum must be divisible by 7. The minimum column sum is 9 and the maximum is 18. So, possible column sums are 14 and 21. But 21 is more than 18, so only 14 is possible. Wait, 14 is less than 18, so actually, 14 and 21. But 21 is too big, so only 14 is possible? Wait, 7 divides 14, but 21 is also a multiple of 7, but 21 is larger than 18, so for n=9, each column must sum to 14.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recalculate. For n=9, each column has 9 cells, each being 1 or 2. So, the sum can be from 9 to 18. The multiples of 7 in that range are 14 and 21. But 21 is too big, so only 14 is possible. So, each column must sum to 14.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, the sum must be a multiple of 5, so 10 or 15.\n\nSo, for n=9, each row must sum to 10 or 15, and each column must sum to 14.\n\nNow, let's think about the total sum of the entire table. The total sum can be calculated in two ways: by summing all the row sums or by summing all the column sums.\n\nIf each row sums to 10 or 15, and there are 9 rows, the total sum S must satisfy 9*10 ≤ S ≤ 9*15, so 90 ≤ S ≤ 135.\n\nSimilarly, each column sums to 14, and there are 9 columns, so total sum S = 9*14 = 126.\n\nSo, the total sum must be 126. Therefore, the sum of all rows must be 126. Since each row is either 10 or 15, let me denote the number of rows with sum 10 as x and the number of rows with sum 15 as y. Then, x + y = 9, and 10x + 15y = 126.\n\nLet me solve these equations:\n\nFrom x + y = 9, we get x = 9 - y.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n10*(9 - y) + 15y = 126\n\n90 - 10y + 15y = 126\n\n90 + 5y = 126\n\n5y = 36\n\ny = 36 / 5 = 7.2\n\nWait, that's not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. So, y must be an integer, but 7.2 is not. That suggests that it's impossible to have such a table for n=9.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nTotal sum from rows: 10x + 15y = 126\n\nTotal sum from columns: 14*9 = 126\n\nSo, 10x + 15y = 126\n\nx + y = 9\n\nSo, solving:\n\nFrom x = 9 - y,\n\n10*(9 - y) + 15y = 126\n\n90 -10y +15y = 126\n\n90 +5y = 126\n\n5y = 36\n\ny = 7.2\n\nHmm, same result. So, y is 7.2, which is not an integer. Therefore, it's impossible to have such a table for n=9.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"je možné vyplniť tabuľku\", which translates to \"is it possible to fill the table\". So, for n=9, it's not possible because we end up with a non-integer number of rows with sum 15.\n\nSo, the answer for part a) is no, it's not possible.\n\nNow, moving on to part b) where n=12.\n\nFor n=12, each row has 12 cells. The sum of each row must be divisible by 5. The minimum row sum is 12, maximum is 24. So, possible row sums are 15, 20.\n\nSimilarly, each column has 12 cells, so the sum must be divisible by 7. The minimum column sum is 12, maximum is 24. So, possible column sums are 14, 21.\n\nWait, 7 divides 14 and 21, which are within 12 to 24. So, each column can sum to 14 or 21.\n\nNow, let's compute the total sum S.\n\nFrom rows: Each row is 15 or 20, 12 rows. So, total sum S = 15x + 20y, where x + y =12.\n\nFrom columns: Each column is 14 or 21, 12 columns. So, total sum S =14a +21b, where a + b =12.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n15x +20y =14a +21b\n\nBut x + y =12, a + b=12.\n\nSo, let's express x =12 - y, a=12 - b.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n15*(12 - y) +20y =14*(12 - b) +21b\n\nCompute both sides:\n\nLeft side: 180 -15y +20y =180 +5y\n\nRight side: 168 -14b +21b =168 +7b\n\nSo, 180 +5y =168 +7b\n\nSimplify:\n\n180 -168 +5y -7b =0\n\n12 +5y -7b =0\n\nSo, 5y -7b = -12\n\nWe need to find integers y and b such that 5y -7b = -12, with y and b between 0 and12.\n\nLet me solve for y:\n\n5y =7b -12\n\nSo, y=(7b -12)/5\n\nWe need y to be integer, so 7b -12 must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 7b ≡12 mod5\n\n12 mod5 is 2, so 7b ≡2 mod5\n\nBut 7≡2 mod5, so 2b≡2 mod5\n\nDivide both sides by 2: b≡1 mod5\n\nSo, b=1,6,11\n\nNow, let's check each possible b:\n\nCase 1: b=1\n\nThen, y=(7*1 -12)/5=(7-12)/5=(-5)/5=-1\n\nNegative y, which is invalid.\n\nCase 2: b=6\n\ny=(7*6 -12)/5=(42-12)/5=30/5=6\n\nSo, y=6, which is valid.\n\nCase3: b=11\n\ny=(7*11 -12)/5=(77-12)/5=65/5=13\n\nBut y=13, but since y +x=12, y cannot be 13. So, invalid.\n\nThus, only b=6 gives a valid solution: y=6, b=6.\n\nTherefore, x=12 - y=6, a=12 -b=6.\n\nSo, we have 6 rows with sum 15, 6 rows with sum 20, 6 columns with sum14, and 6 columns with sum21.\n\nNow, let's check if this is possible.\n\nTotal sum S=15*6 +20*6=90 +120=210\n\nFrom columns:14*6 +21*6=84 +126=210\n\nSo, total sum is consistent.\n\nNow, the question is, can we arrange 1s and 2s in a 12x12 grid such that 6 rows have sum15 and 6 rows have sum20, and 6 columns have sum14 and 6 columns have sum21.\n\nThis seems possible, but let me think about the feasibility.\n\nEach row with sum15: since each cell is 1 or 2, the number of 2s in such a row is (15 -12)/1=3. So, 3 twos and 9 ones.\n\nSimilarly, rows with sum20: (20 -12)/1=8. So, 8 twos and 4 ones.\n\nFor columns: sum14: (14 -12)/1=2. So, 2 twos and 10 ones.\n\nSum21: (21 -12)/1=9. So, 9 twos and 3 ones.\n\nSo, each column has either 2 or 9 twos.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to arranging the number of twos in each row and column such that the row and column constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis is similar to a transportation problem in linear programming, where we have to satisfy supply and demand constraints.\n\nIn this case, the rows have supply: 6 rows with 3 twos, 6 rows with 8 twos.\n\nTotal twos in rows:6*3 +6*8=18 +48=66\n\nColumns:6 columns with 2 twos, 6 columns with9 twos.\n\nTotal twos in columns:6*2 +6*9=12 +54=66\n\nSo, total twos match.\n\nTherefore, it's possible to arrange the twos in the grid such that each row and column has the required number of twos.\n\nTherefore, such a table can be filled.\n\nSo, for part b), it's possible.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\na) n=9: Not possible.\n\nb) n=12: Possible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\na) \\boxed{\\text{Není možné}}  \nb) \\boxed{\\text{Místo je možné}}  \n\nIn boxed form as per instruction:\n\na) \\boxed{\\text{Není možné}}  \nb) \\boxed{\\text{Místo je možné}}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if it is possible to fill an \\(n \\times n\\) table with 1s and 2s such that the sum of each row is divisible by 5 and the sum of each column is divisible by 7, we analyze the cases for \\(n = 9\\) and \\(n = 12\\).\n\n### Case a) \\(n = 9\\)\n\n1. Each row must sum to a multiple of 5. The possible sums for each row are 10 or 15.\n2. Each column must sum to a multiple of 7. The only possible sum for each column is 14.\n3. The total sum of the table must be consistent when calculated from rows and columns.\n4. The total sum from columns is \\(9 \\times 14 = 126\\).\n5.

Let \\(x\\) be the number of rows summing to 15 and \\(y\\) be the number of rows summing to 20.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I need to find all integers \\( n \\) greater than 2 where \\( n^{n-2} \\) can be expressed as some integer raised to the power of \\( n \\). In other words, there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n^{n-2} = k^n \\). That makes sense.\n\nSo, the equation I need to solve is \\( n^{n-2} = k^n \\). My goal is to find all integers \\( n > 2 \\) for which such a \\( k \\) exists.\n\nLet me start by considering small values of \\( n \\) to see if I can spot a pattern or find some solutions.\n\nStarting with \\( n = 3 \\):\n\\( 3^{3-2} = 3^1 = 3 \\). Is 3 a perfect 3rd power? Well, 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, so 3 is not a perfect cube. So, \\( n = 3 \\) doesn't work.\n\nNext, \\( n = 4 \\):\n\\( 4^{4-2} = 4^2 = 16 \\). Is 16 a perfect 4th power? Let's see: 2^4 = 16. Yes, it is! So, \\( k = 2 \\) works here. Therefore, \\( n = 4 \\) is a solution.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 5 \\):\n\\( 5^{5-2} = 5^3 = 125 \\). Is 125 a perfect 5th power? Let's check: 2^5 = 32, 3^5 = 243. 125 is between them, so it's not a perfect 5th power. So, \\( n = 5 \\) doesn't work.\n\nNext, \\( n = 6 \\):\n\\( 6^{6-2} = 6^4 = 1296 \\). Is 1296 a perfect 6th power? Let's see: 3^6 = 729, 4^6 = 4096. 1296 is between them, so it's not a perfect 6th power. So, \\( n = 6 \\) doesn't work.\n\nHow about \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\( 7^{7-2} = 7^5 = 16807 \\). Is this a perfect 7th power? Let's check: 3^7 = 2187, 4^7 = 16384, 5^7 = 78125. 16807 is between 4^7 and 5^7, but 16384 is 4^7, which is 16384, and 16807 is 7^5, so it's not a perfect 7th power. So, \\( n = 7 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I should try \\( n = 8 \\):\n\\( 8^{8-2} = 8^6 = 262144 \\). Is this a perfect 8th power? Let's see: 4^8 = 65536, 5^8 = 390625. 262144 is between them, so it's not a perfect 8th power. Hmm, no luck there.\n\nLet me try \\( n = 9 \\):\n\\( 9^{9-2} = 9^7 = 4782969 \\). Is this a perfect 9th power? Let's check: 5^9 = 1953125, 6^9 = 10077696. 4782969 is between them, so it's not a perfect 9th power. So, \\( n = 9 \\) doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so far, only \\( n = 4 \\) works. Maybe I should try \\( n = 16 \\) or something like that? Wait, let me think differently.\n\nThe equation is \\( n^{n-2} = k^n \\). Let me rewrite this as \\( k^n = n^{n-2} \\). Taking both sides to the power of \\( 1/n \\), we get \\( k = n^{(n-2)/n} = n^{1 - 2/n} \\). So, \\( k = n^{1 - 2/n} \\).\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, \\( n^{1 - 2/n} \\) must be an integer. Let me write this as \\( k = n^{(n - 2)/n} = n^{1 - 2/n} \\). So, \\( n^{1 - 2/n} \\) must be integer.\n\nLet me denote \\( m = n \\). Then, \\( k = m^{1 - 2/m} \\). For \\( k \\) to be integer, \\( m^{1 - 2/m} \\) must be integer. Let me write this as \\( m^{(m - 2)/m} = (m^{m - 2})^{1/m} \\). Wait, that's the same as the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( k \\) as \\( m^{(m - 2)/m} \\). So, \\( k = m^{1 - 2/m} \\). For \\( k \\) to be integer, \\( m^{1 - 2/m} \\) must be integer. Let me think about when \\( m^{1 - 2/m} \\) is integer.\n\nLet me consider \\( m^{1 - 2/m} = e^{(1 - 2/m) \\ln m} \\). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write \\( m^{1 - 2/m} = m \\cdot m^{-2/m} = m \\cdot (m^{-2})^{1/m} \\). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about \\( m^{1 - 2/m} \\) as \\( \\sqrt[m]{m^{m - 2}} \\). So, \\( k = \\sqrt[m]{m^{m - 2}} \\). Therefore, \\( m^{m - 2} \\) must be a perfect \\( m \\)-th power.\n\nSo, \\( m^{m - 2} = k^m \\). Therefore, \\( m^{m - 2} \\) is a perfect \\( m \\)-th power. So, \\( m^{m - 2} \\) must be equal to \\( k^m \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nLet me think about the prime factorization of \\( m \\). Suppose \\( m \\) is a prime number. Then, \\( m^{m - 2} \\) is just a prime power. For it to be a perfect \\( m \\)-th power, the exponent \\( m - 2 \\) must be a multiple of \\( m \\). So, \\( m - 2 \\) must be divisible by \\( m \\). But \\( m - 2 \\) is less than \\( m \\) for \\( m > 2 \\), so the only way \\( m - 2 \\) is divisible by \\( m \\) is if \\( m - 2 = 0 \\), which would mean \\( m = 2 \\). But \\( m > 2 \\), so primes greater than 2 won't work.\n\nTherefore, \\( m \\) must be composite. Let me consider \\( m \\) as a composite number. Let me think about \\( m = 4 \\), which worked earlier. Let me see why.\n\nFor \\( m = 4 \\), \\( m^{m - 2} = 4^{2} = 16 \\), which is \\( 2^4 \\). So, \\( k = 2 \\). So, in this case, \\( m = 4 \\) is a square number, and \\( m^{m - 2} \\) is a perfect \\( m \\)-th power because \\( 4^2 = (2)^4 \\).\n\nSimilarly, let me check \\( m = 9 \\). \\( 9^{7} = 4782969 \\). Is this a perfect 9th power? Let me compute \\( 3^9 = 19683 \\), \\( 4^9 = 262144 \\), \\( 5^9 = 1953125 \\), \\( 6^9 = 10077696 \\). Wait, 4782969 is between \\( 5^9 \\) and \\( 6^9 \\), so it's not a perfect 9th power. So, \\( m = 9 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe \\( m \\) needs to be a perfect square? Let me test \\( m = 16 \\). \\( 16^{14} \\). Is this a perfect 16th power? Let's see: \\( 16^{14} = (2^4)^{14} = 2^{56} \\). Is 2^{56} a perfect 16th power? Yes, because \\( (2^3.5)^{16} = 2^{56} \\), but 3.5 is not an integer. Wait, no, that's not an integer. So, 2^{56} is a perfect 16th power only if 56 is divisible by 16, which it is: 56 divided by 16 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So, 2^{56} is not a perfect 16th power. Therefore, \\( m = 16 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the equation \\( n^{n - 2} = k^n \\). Let me take both sides to the power of \\( 1/n \\), so \\( k = n^{(n - 2)/n} = n^{1 - 2/n} \\). So, \\( k = n \\times n^{-2/n} = n \\times (n^{-2})^{1/n} \\). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me write \\( k = n^{(n - 2)/n} \\). So, \\( k = n^{1 - 2/n} \\). For \\( k \\) to be integer, \\( n^{1 - 2/n} \\) must be integer. Let me denote \\( t = n^{1 - 2/n} \\). Then, \\( t^n = n^{n - 2} \\). So, \\( t \\) must be an integer such that \\( t^n = n^{n - 2} \\).\n\nLet me take logarithms on both sides: \\( n \\ln t = (n - 2) \\ln n \\). So, \\( \\ln t = \\frac{(n - 2)}{n} \\ln n \\). Therefore, \\( t = e^{\\frac{(n - 2)}{n} \\ln n} = n^{(n - 2)/n} \\). Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write \\( t = n^{(n - 2)/n} = n^{1 - 2/n} = n \\times n^{-2/n} \\). So, \\( t = n \\times (n^{-2})^{1/n} \\). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can write \\( t = n^{(n - 2)/n} = (n^{(n - 2)})^{1/n} \\). So, \\( t \\) is the \\( n \\)-th root of \\( n^{n - 2} \\). So, \\( t \\) must be integer, so \\( n^{n - 2} \\) must be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power.\n\nTherefore, \\( n^{n - 2} = k^n \\). So, \\( n^{n - 2} \\) must be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power. So, \\( n^{n - 2} = (k)^n \\). Therefore, \\( n^{n - 2} \\) must be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power.\n\nSo, for \\( n^{n - 2} \\) to be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, the exponent \\( n - 2 \\) must be a multiple of \\( n \\), but that's only possible if \\( n - 2 \\) is a multiple of \\( n \\), which would require \\( n - 2 = 0 \\), so \\( n = 2 \\), but \\( n > 2 \\). So, that can't be.\n\nWait, that can't be right because we already saw that \\( n = 4 \\) works. So, maybe my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, no, because \\( n^{n - 2} \\) is not necessarily \\( n \\) raised to a multiple of \\( n \\). Instead, \\( n^{n - 2} \\) is \\( n \\) raised to \\( n - 2 \\), which is not a multiple of \\( n \\), but when we take the \\( n \\)-th root, it's \\( n^{(n - 2)/n} \\). So, for \\( n^{(n - 2)/n} \\) to be integer, \\( (n - 2)/n \\) must be such that \\( n \\) raised to that power is integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( n \\) must be a perfect power itself. Let me think.\n\nSuppose \\( n = m^k \\) for some integers \\( m, k \\). Then, \\( n^{n - 2} = (m^k)^{n - 2} = m^{k(n - 2)} \\). For this to be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, \\( k(n - 2) \\) must be a multiple of \\( n \\). So, \\( k(n - 2) = n \\times t \\) for some integer \\( t \\). Therefore, \\( k = \\frac{n t}{n - 2} \\). Since \\( k \\) must be integer, \\( n - 2 \\) must divide \\( n t \\). Since \\( n \\) and \\( n - 2 \\) are coprime if \\( n \\) is even, or share a common factor of 1 or 2 if \\( n \\) is odd.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try specific values again.\n\nWe saw that \\( n = 4 \\) works because \\( 4^{2} = 16 = 2^4 \\). So, \\( k = 2 \\", "answer": "**Ukážeme, že jediné vyhovujúce n je 4.**  \n\nKvôli stručnosti budeme v celom riešení písať „n-tá mocnina“ namiesto „n-tá mocnina celého čísla“.

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express x from Equation (2) in terms of y and z, and plug that into Equation (3). Let's try that.\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\) => \\( x = \\sqrt{yz + 2} \\)\n\nPlugging this into Equation (3):\n\n\\( z \\cdot \\sqrt{yz + 2} + 3 = y^2 \\)\n\nAgain, this seems messy. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps adding all three equations together?\n\nLet me see:\n\nEquation (1) + Equation (2) + Equation (3):\n\n\\( xy + 1 + yz + 2 + zx + 3 = z^2 + x^2 + y^2 \\)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\( xy + yz + zx + 6 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\)\n\nHmm, so:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = 6 \\)\n\nI remember that \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = \\frac{1}{2}[(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2] \\). So, this expression is equal to 6.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}[(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2] = 6 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( (x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 12 \\)\n\nOkay, so the sum of the squares of the differences between each pair of variables is 12. That's an interesting relationship, but I'm not sure how helpful it is yet. Maybe I can use this later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each variable in terms of another and substitute step by step.\n\nLet me try to express z from Equation (1):\n\n\\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\)\n\nThen, plug this into Equation (2):\n\n\\( y \\cdot \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 2 = x^2 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( \\sqrt{xy + 1} = a \\), so \\( a^2 = xy + 1 \\). Then, Equation (2) becomes:\n\n\\( y \\cdot a + 2 = x^2 \\)\n\nBut I also have \\( a^2 = xy + 1 \\), so \\( xy = a^2 - 1 \\). Let me express x in terms of y and a:\n\nFrom \\( xy = a^2 - 1 \\), \\( x = \\frac{a^2 - 1}{y} \\)\n\nPlugging this into Equation (2):\n\n\\( y \\cdot a + 2 = \\left( \\frac{a^2 - 1}{y} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express x from Equation (2):\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\) => \\( x = \\sqrt{yz + 2} \\)\n\nPlug this into Equation (3):\n\n\\( z \\cdot \\sqrt{yz + 2} + 3 = y^2 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( \\sqrt{yz + 2} = b \\), so \\( b^2 = yz + 2 \\). Then, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n\\( z \\cdot b + 3 = y^2 \\)\n\nBut from \\( b^2 = yz + 2 \\), we have \\( yz = b^2 - 2 \\). So, \\( z = \\frac{b^2 - 2}{y} \\)\n\nPlugging this into Equation (3):\n\n\\( \\frac{b^2 - 2}{y} \\cdot b + 3 = y^2 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{b(b^2 - 2)}{y} + 3 = y^2 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems too convoluted. Maybe I need a different strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try to express y in terms of x, then z in terms of x, and so on.\n\nFrom Equation (1): \\( z^2 = xy + 1 \\) => \\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\)\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x^2 = yz + 2 \\). Substitute z from above:\n\n\\( x^2 = y \\cdot \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 2 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( \\sqrt{xy + 1} = c \\), so \\( c^2 = xy + 1 \\) => \\( xy = c^2 - 1 \\)\n\nThen, Equation (2) becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 = y \\cdot c + 2 \\)\n\nBut \\( y = \\frac{c^2 - 1}{x} \\) from \\( xy = c^2 - 1 \\)\n\nSo, plug this into Equation (2):\n\n\\( x^2 = \\left( \\frac{c^2 - 1}{x} \\right) \\cdot c + 2 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x^2 = \\frac{c(c^2 - 1)}{x} + 2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n\\( x^3 = c(c^2 - 1) + 2x \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( x^3 - 2x - c(c^2 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation in x, but c is related to x and y, which complicates things. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the system as a cyclic system, where each equation relates two variables, and then the third. Maybe I can find a substitution that cycles through all three variables.\n\nLet me try to express z from Equation (1): \\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\)\n\nThen, plug this into Equation (3): \\( y^2 = z x + 3 = x \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y^2 = x \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 3 \\)\n\nThis seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nLet me write:\n\n\\( y^2 - 3 = x \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\( (y^2 - 3)^2 = x^2 (xy + 1) \\)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\( y^4 - 6y^2 + 9 = x^3 y + x^2 \\)\n\nHmm, now I have an equation involving x^3 y and x^2. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from Equation (2) and substitute here.\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x^2 = y z + 2 \\). But z is \\( \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\), so:\n\n\\( x^2 = y \\sqrt{xy + 1} + 2 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( \\sqrt{xy + 1} = d \\), so \\( d^2 = xy + 1 \\) => \\( xy = d^2 - 1 \\)\n\nThen, Equation (2) becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 = y d + 2 \\)\n\nBut \\( y = \\frac{d^2 - 1}{x} \\), so plug that in:\n\n\\( x^2 = \\frac{d^2 - 1}{x} \\cdot d + 2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n\\( x^3 = d(d^2 - 1) + 2x \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( x^3 - 2x - d(d^2 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems similar to what I had earlier. Maybe I can relate this to the other equation.\n\nWait, in the previous step, I had:\n\n\\( y^4 - 6y^2 + 9 = x^3 y + x^2 \\)\n\nIf I can express x^3 y in terms of other variables, maybe I can substitute.\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x^2 = y z + 2 \\) => \\( y z = x^2 - 2 \\)\n\nFrom Equation (1): \\( z^2 = x y + 1 \\) => \\( z = \\sqrt{x y + 1} \\)\n\nSo, \\( y \\sqrt{x y + 1} = x^2 - 2 \\)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n\\( y^2 (x y + 1) = (x^2 - 2)^2 \\)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( x y^3 + y^2 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 \\)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n\\( x y^3 + y^2 = x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 \\)\n\nHmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the system as a cyclic system and try to find a substitution that cycles through all variables.\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of the next.\n\nFrom Equation (1): \\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} \\)\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( x = \\sqrt{yz + 2} \\)\n\nFrom Equation (3): \\( y = \\sqrt{zx + 3} \\)\n\nSo, substituting each into the next, we get:\n\n\\( z = \\sqrt{xy + 1} = \\sqrt{ x \\cdot \\sqrt{zx + 3} + 1 } \\)\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can write it as:\n\n\\( z = \\sqrt{ x \\cdot \\sqrt{zx + 3} + 1 } \\)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n\\( z^2 = x \\cdot \\sqrt{zx + 3} + 1 \\)\n\nBut from Equation (1), \\( z^2 = x y + 1 \\), so:\n\n\\( x y + 1 = x \\cdot \\sqrt{zx + 3} + 1 \\)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\( x y = x \\cdot \\sqrt{zx + 3} \\)\n\nAssuming x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n\\( y = \\sqrt{zx + 3} \\)\n\nBut from Equation (3), \\( y = \\sqrt{zx + 3} \\), so this is consistent. Hmm, so this substitution doesn't give us new information.\n\nMaybe I need to consider specific values or look for symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that x, y, z are positive. Since we're dealing with square roots, maybe all variables are positive. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf x, y, z are positive, then all the square roots are defined, and the equations make sense.\n\nSo, assuming x, y, z > 0.\n\nLet me try to find some bounds or relations.\n\nFrom Equation (1): \\( z^2 = x y + 1 \\). Since x, y > 0, z must be greater than 1, because z^2 > 1.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (2): \\( x^2 = y z + 2 \\). Since y, z > 0, x must be greater than sqrt(2), because x^2 > 2.\n\nFrom Equation (3): \\( y^2 = z x + 3 \\). Since z, x > 0, y must be greater than sqrt(3), because y^2 > 3.\n\nSo, we have x > sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, y > sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, z > 1.\n\nMaybe I can try to find integer solutions. Let me see if x, y, z are integers.\n\nSuppose x, y, z are integers. Then, from Equation (1): z^2 = x y + 1. So, z^2 - 1 must be divisible by x y.\n\nFrom Equation (2): x^2 = y z + 2. So, x^2 - 2 must be divisible by y z.\n\nFrom Equation (3): y^2 = z x + 3. So, y^2 - 3 must be divisible by z x.\n\nLet me try small integer values.\n\nStart with z. Since z > 1, possible z values: 2, 3, 4,...\n\nTry z = 2.\n\nFrom Equation (1): z^2 = 4 = x y + 1 => x y = 3.\n\nPossible integer pairs (x, y): (1,3), (3,1).

Chcel by som určiť, aká je táto odvesna.\n\nZačneme teda tým, že si označíme strany trojuholníka. Označme si strany a, b a c, kde c je prepona. Dá sa teda zapísať Pythagorovu větu: a² + b² = c².\n\nObvod trojuholníka je a + b + c = 11990. Navyše, vieme, že jedna z odvesn (a alebo b) je prvočíslo. Označme teda bez ujmy na obecnosti a = p, kde p je prvočíslo.\n\nNyní můžeme zapsat soustavu rovnic:\n1. a + b + c = 11990\n2. a² + b² = c²\n3. a = p, kde p je prvočíslo\n\nZ první rovnice můžeme vyjádřit c = 11990 - a - b. Potom ji dosadíme do druhé rovnice:\n\np² + b² = (11990 - p - b)²\n\nRozložme pravou stranu:\n(11990 - p - b)² = (11990 - p)² - 2*(11990 - p)*b + b²\n\nZ toho plyne:\np² + b² = (11990 - p)² - 2*(11990 - p)*b + b²\n\nZ简化的 rovnice můžeme vymyslel, že se b² vylmnou, a zbytek upravíme:\np² = (11990 - p)² - 2*(11990 - p)*b\n\nRearrange:\n2*(11990 - p)*b = (11990 - p)² - p²\n\nVypočítáme pravou stranu:\n(11990 - p)² - p² = 11990² - 2*11990*p + p² - p² = 11990² - 2*11990*p\n\nTakže:\n2*(11990 - p)*b = 11990² - 2*11990*p\n\nVydělíme obě strany 2*(11990 - p):\nb = (11990² - 2*11990*p) / (2*(11990 - p))\n\nZjednodušme:\nb = (11990*(11990 - 2p)) / (2*(11990 - p))\n\nVidíme, že pro b musí být celé číslo, proto musí být 2*(11990 - p) dělitel 11990*(11990 - 2p).\n\nTato podmínka nám pomůže určit možné hodnoty p.\n\nVypočítáme 11990/2 = 5995. Proto 11990 = 2*5995.\n\nTakže můžeme psát:\nb = (2*5995*(11990 - 2p)) / (2*(11990 - p)) ) = (5995*(11990 - 2p)) / (11990 - p)\n\nVidíme, že 11990 - p musí být dělител 5995*(11990 - 2p).\n\nZ toho plyne, že 11990 - p musí být dělител 5995*(11990 - 2p).\n\nVypočítáme 11990 - 2p = (11990 - p) - p.\n\nTedy 11990 - p musí být dělител 5995*((11990 - p) - p).\n\nTato podmínka nám pomůže zjistit možné hodnoty p.\n\nVypočítáme 5995 = 5*1199. Z toho plyne, že 5995 je složené číslo, jeho dělители jsou 1, 5, 1199, 5995.\n\nTedy 11990 - p musí být jedno z těchto dělителей: 1, 5, 1199, 5995.\n\nZ toho plyne, že 11990 - p ∈ {1, 5, 1199, 5995}.\n\nTedy možné hodnoty p jsou:\np = 11990 - 1 = 11989\np = 11990 - 5 = 11985\np = 11990 - 1199 = 10791\np = 11990 - 5995 = 5995\n\nNyní kontrolujeme, kdy z těchto hodnot je p prvočíslo.\n\np = 11989: Potřebujeme zjistit, jestli je prvočíslo. 11989 je známe, že je dělitelné 7: 7*1712 = 12004, což je přesně o 15 větší, takže 11989 = 7*1712 - 15, což je chyba.
