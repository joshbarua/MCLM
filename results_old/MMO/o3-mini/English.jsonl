The number of trailing zeroes in the representation of 11! in base b is determined by the greatest integer k such that b^k divides 11!. Writing b in its prime factorization b = p₁^(α₁)p₂^(α₂)…, we have that the number of trailing zeroes is given by\n\n  minₚ (⌊vₚ(11!)/α⌋)\n\nand we want this minimum to equal 2 exactly.

Thus whenever a ≥ 1 the term “has a factor of p” in its coefficient (regardless of what the multinomial coefficient is). The number of solutions with a, b, c ≥ 0 and a + b + c = 10 is\n\n  C(10+3–1, 3–1) = C(12,2) = 66.\n\nAmong these, the terms with a = 0 come from the expansion of (y + z)^10. There are exactly 11 such terms (since b + c = 10, and b can be 0,1,…,10). For those terms with a = 0 the coefficient is just C(10, b) and, assuming p > 10, none of those binomial coefficients is divisible by the prime p. (If p were 3, 5, or 7 one would have to check which binomial coefficients vanish mod p; however, the phrasing “are always multiples of p” is verified by the obvious p‑factor when a ≥ 1.) \n\nThus, the number of terms that are always divisible by p (namely those with a ≥ 1) is\n\n  66 – 11 = 55.\n\nTherefore, M = \\boxed{55}.", "answer": "55"}
