They all involve graph theory concepts, right? So, first, I need to understand the problem statements properly.\n\nStarting with part (a): We have 200 students on Facebook. Each student is friends with at least n others. We need to find the minimal n such that any two students are either friends or share at least one common friend. \n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem related to graph connectivity or maybe Ramsey numbers, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, it's about ensuring that the graph is such that the diameter is at most 2. Because if every pair of nodes (students) are either adjacent or share a common neighbor, then the diameter is 2. So, the question is: what's the minimal degree n such that a graph of 200 nodes with minimum degree n has diameter at most 2.\n\nI recall there's a theorem related to this. Maybe Erdős's theorem on graphs with high girth and high chromatic number isn't directly applicable here. Let me think. Maybe Turán's theorem? Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing complete subgraphs of a certain size. But Turán's theorem is more about the number of edges and the structure of the graph. Alternatively, maybe using the probabilistic method to estimate the required degree?\n\nAlternatively, think about the complement graph. If the original graph has diameter 2, then its complement graph does not contain any two nodes that are both non-adjacent and have no common neighbors. Wait, the complement graph would have diameter... Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this as a graph problem. Let G be a graph with 200 vertices where each vertex has degree at least n. We need that for any two vertices u and v, either uv is an edge, or there exists a vertex w adjacent to both u and v. So, the complement graph \\(\\overline{G}\\) must not contain any edge that is not part of a triangle. Wait, no. The complement graph would have an edge between u and v if they are not friends in G. But in order for u and v to have a common friend, that means in G there exists a w adjacent to both u and v. So in the complement graph, the non-edges in G correspond to edges in \\(\\overline{G}\\), and the common friends in G correspond to common neighbors in G, which would be non-edges in \\(\\overline{G}\\) but... Maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the concept of the diameter. For a graph with diameter 2, any two vertices must be connected by a path of length at most 2. So, if two students aren't friends, they must have a mutual friend. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal n such that the graph has diameter 2. So, we need to find the minimal n where a graph on 200 vertices with minimum degree n has diameter 2.\n\nI remember that in graph theory, there is a result that gives the maximum possible minimum degree of a graph with diameter 2. Let me recall. For a graph with diameter 2 and n vertices, the maximum possible minimum degree is roughly n/2. Wait, maybe more precise: if a graph has diameter 2, then its minimum degree δ satisfies δ ≥ n - 1 - (n - 1 choose 2), but that seems off.\n\nWait, another approach: For a graph with diameter 2, each vertex must be connected to every other vertex either directly or through one of its neighbors. So, for a vertex u, all other vertices must be adjacent to u or adjacent to at least one neighbor of u. So, the number of vertices not adjacent to u is at most the number of neighbors of u's neighbors. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote G as the graph with 200 vertices. For any vertex u, let N(u) be the set of neighbors of u, and let S(u) be the set of vertices not adjacent to u. Then, since the diameter is 2, every vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u). Therefore, the number of vertices in S(u) is at most the number of edges in the graph induced by N(u). Wait, no. Each vertex in N(u) can have edges among themselves and to other vertices. But since S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u), the number of vertices in S(u) is at most the number of vertices adjacent to any vertex in N(u). \n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the maximum size of S(u). Since each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u), and each vertex in N(u) can cover at most (200 - 1 - n) vertices (since each vertex in N(u) is adjacent to u and n-1 others). Wait, no. Each vertex in N(u) has degree at least n, so each vertex in N(u) is adjacent to at least n vertices, one of which is u. Therefore, each vertex in N(u) can be adjacent to at most 198 - n vertices outside of u. But since S(u) is the set of vertices not adjacent to u, which has size 200 - 1 - |N(u)| = 198 - |N(u)|. Wait, but |N(u)| is at least n, so |S(u)| is at most 198 - n. \n\nBut each vertex in N(u) can be adjacent to vertices in S(u). Each vertex in N(u) can have at most 198 - n edges to S(u), but since each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u), the number of vertices in S(u) must be ≤ |N(u)| * (198 - n) / 1. Wait, that might not be the right way. Let's use an inequality.\n\nEach vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u). Therefore, the number of vertices in S(u) is ≤ the number of edges from N(u) to S(u). Each vertex in N(u) has degree at least n, so the number of edges from N(u) to the entire graph is at least n * |N(u)|. However, some of these edges are within N(u) itself. Let’s denote E(N(u)) as the number of edges within N(u). Then, the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is at least n * |N(u)| - 2 * E(N(u)). \n\nBut since S(u) is the set of vertices not adjacent to u, and the total number of vertices is 200, |S(u)| = 200 - 1 - |N(u)|. Therefore, the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is at least n * |N(u)| - 2 * E(N(u)). But we also need that the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is at least |S(u)|, since each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u). Therefore:\n\nn * |N(u)| - 2 * E(N(u)) ≥ |S(u)|\n\nBut |S(u)| = 200 - 1 - |N(u)| = 199 - |N(u)|\n\nSo,\n\nn * |N(u)| - 2 * E(N(u)) ≥ 199 - |N(u)|\n\nBut we need to relate E(N(u)) to |N(u)|. The number of edges within N(u) can be as low as 0 (if N(u) is an independent set) or as high as |N(u)| choose 2. But to minimize n, we need to maximize E(N(u)) to minimize the left-hand side. Wait, no. Wait, if E(N(u)) is maximized, then 2 * E(N(u)) is larger, which would make the left-hand side smaller, requiring a smaller n. But since we need the inequality to hold regardless of E(N(u)), we have to consider the worst case, i.e., the minimum possible value of the left-hand side. Therefore, to ensure the inequality holds for all possible graphs, we have to take the minimal value of the left-hand side, which occurs when E(N(u)) is as large as possible. Wait, no. Wait, actually, since E(N(u)) is the number of edges within N(u), and if we want the inequality to hold for any graph, then we need to consider the minimal possible value of the left-hand side. Because if E(N(u)) is larger, the left-hand side becomes smaller, making the inequality easier to satisfy. Therefore, to find the minimal n that works for all graphs, we need to consider the case where E(N(u)) is as large as possible. Therefore, the minimal left-hand side is when E(N(u)) is maximum, which is |N(u)|(|N(u)| - 1)/2. Therefore, substituting:\n\nn * |N(u)| - 2 * [ |N(u)|(|N(u)| - 1)/2 ] ≥ 199 - |N(u)|\n\nSimplify:\n\nn * |N(u)| - |N(u)|(|N(u)| - 1) ≥ 199 - |N(u)|\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\n|N(u)| (n - |N(u)| + 1)\n\nTherefore:\n\n|N(u)| (n - |N(u)| + 1) ≥ 199 - |N(u)|\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n|N(u)| (n - |N(u)| + 1) + |N(u)| - 199 ≥ 0\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think again.\n\nSince each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u). So, the number of vertices in S(u) is ≤ the number of edges from N(u) to S(u). Each vertex in N(u) can cover at most |S(u)| edges, but since each vertex in N(u) can have at most degree n, and they are already connected to u, the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is at most |N(u)| * (n - 1). Wait, no. Each vertex in N(u) can have edges to other vertices. But the edges from N(u) to S(u) are edges going out of N(u) to S(u). Since S(u) is the set not adjacent to u, but the vertices in S(u) can be adjacent to other vertices. However, each vertex in N(u) has degree at least n, so the number of edges from N(u) to the entire graph is at least n * |N(u)|. But some of these edges are within N(u) and others are going to S(u) or to u. Since u is connected to all vertices in N(u), the edges from N(u) to the graph are the edges within N(u) plus the edges from N(u) to S(u). So:\n\nn * |N(u)| ≤ E(N(u)) + |N(u)| * (198 - |N(u)| - n + 1)?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me try again.\n\nThe total number of edges incident to N(u) is at least n * |N(u)|. These edges are split between edges inside N(u) and edges from N(u) to the rest of the graph (which includes S(u) and the other vertices outside N(u) and u). But the rest of the graph includes 200 - |N(u)| - 1 vertices (excluding u). However, S(u) is part of the rest. So, the number of edges from N(u) to the rest of the graph is at least n * |N(u)| - E(N(u)). But since the rest of the graph includes S(u) and other vertices. However, we need that each vertex in S(u) is connected to at least one vertex in N(u). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s denote |N(u)| = d. Then, the number of vertices in S(u) is 199 - d. Each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex in N(u). Therefore, the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is at least 199 - d. \n\nBut each vertex in N(u) can have at most (199 - d) edges to S(u), because S(u) has size 199 - d. However, the number of edges from N(u) to S(u) is also equal to the sum over each vertex in N(u) of the number of edges from that vertex to S(u). Since each vertex in N(u) has degree at least n, and they are already connected to u, the number of edges from each vertex in N(u) to S(u) is at least n - 1. Wait, no. Each vertex in N(u) has degree at least n, but one of those edges is to u. Therefore, the number of edges from a vertex in N(u) to the rest of the graph (including S(u) and other vertices outside N(u)) is at least n - 1. Therefore, the total number of edges from N(u) to the rest is at least |N(u)| * (n - 1). But the rest of the graph includes S(u) and other vertices. However, we only care about edges to S(u) here. \n\nBut how does that relate to the edges from N(u) to S(u)? Each edge from N(u) to the rest is either to S(u) or to other vertices not in N(u). Let’s denote E_{N(u), S(u)} as the number of edges from N(u) to S(u), and E_{N(u), rest} as the number of edges from N(u) to the rest of the graph outside N(u) and S(u). Then:\n\nE_{N(u), S(u)} + E_{N(u), rest} = total edges from N(u) to the rest of the graph, which is at least |N(u)| * (n - 1) - E(N(u)), since total edges from N(u) is E(N(u)) + E_{N(u), S(u)} + E_{N(u), rest} = total edges, but we don't have the total edges. Wait, this maybe:\n\nTotal edges incident to N(u) is E(N(u)) + E_{N(u), S(u)} + E_{N(u), rest} ≥ |N(u)| * n.\n\nBut E_{N(u), rest} is the number of edges from N(u) to other vertices outside N(u). The number of vertices outside N(u) is 200 - |N(u)| - 1 = 199 - |N(u)|. So, the maximum possible E_{N(u), rest} is |N(u)|*(199 - |N(u)| - 1), but since we don't know the structure, maybe it's too vague.\n\nBut we know that E_{N(u), S(u)} ≥ 199 - |N(u)|, because each vertex in S(u) must be adjacent to at least one vertex", "answer": "(a) 100 (b) 2 (c) False"}

The problem says that sin³θ + cos³θ equals 11/16, and we need to find the value of sinθ + cosθ. Hmm, I remember there are some formulas related to cubes that might help here. Let me think. \n\nFirst, I recall that the sum of cubes formula is a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try that. So, if we let a = sinθ and b = cosθ, then sin³θ + cos³θ would be (sinθ + cosθ)(sin²θ - sinθcosθ + cos²θ). \n\nOkay, that seems right. Now, I know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, that's one of the Pythagorean identities. So, substituting that into the equation, we get (sinθ + cosθ)(1 - sinθcosθ) = 11/16. \n\nSo, the original equation simplifies to (sinθ + cosθ)(1 - sinθcosθ) = 11/16. Hmm, but we need to find sinθ + cosθ, so maybe we can let x = sinθ + cosθ. Then, the equation becomes x(1 - sinθcosθ) = 11/16. \n\nBut we still have another term, sinθcosθ, which we don't know. Maybe we can find an expression for sinθcosθ in terms of x. Let's see. If we square x, we get (sinθ + cosθ)² = sin²θ + 2sinθcosθ + cos²θ. Again, sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so this becomes x² = 1 + 2sinθcosθ. Therefore, sinθcosθ = (x² - 1)/2. \n\nOkay, so substituting that back into the previous equation, we have x(1 - (x² - 1)/2) = 11/16. Let me simplify the inside of the parentheses first. 1 minus (x² - 1)/2. Let's write 1 as 2/2 to have a common denominator. So, 2/2 - (x² - 1)/2 = (2 - x² + 1)/2 = (3 - x²)/2. \n\nSo now, the equation becomes x*(3 - x²)/2 = 11/16. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: x*(3 - x²) = 11/8. Then, multiply both sides by 8 to get rid of the fraction: 8x(3 - x²) = 11. \n\nExpanding the left side: 24x - 8x³ = 11. Let's rearrange this equation to form a cubic equation: -8x³ + 24x - 11 = 0. Multiplying both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive: 8x³ - 24x + 11 = 0. \n\nSo, now we have the cubic equation 8x³ - 24x + 11 = 0. Hmm, solving cubic equations can be tricky. Maybe there's a rational root? Let's try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (11) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (8). So possible roots are ±1, ±11, ±1/2, ±11/2, ±1/4, ±11/4, ±1/8, ±11/8. \n\nLet me test x = 1: 8(1)^3 -24(1) +11 = 8 -24 +11 = -5 ≠0. Not a root. x = -1: -8 -24 +11 = -21 ≠0. x = 11/8: Let's see, 8*(1331/512) -24*(11/8) +11. That's 10648/512 - 264/8 +11. That's 21.25 -33 +11 = -0.75. Not zero. \n\nHow about x = 1/2: 8*(1/8) -24*(1/2) +11 = 1 -12 +11 = 0. Oh, x=1/2 is a root! So, (x - 1/2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor this cubic equation. \n\nDividing 8x³ -24x +11 by (x - 1/2). Let's use synthetic division. \n\nSet up coefficients: 8, 0, -24, 11. Wait, the cubic is 8x³ + 0x² -24x +11. Dividing by (x - 1/2). So, root at x=1/2. Bring down the 8. Multiply by 1/2: 4. Add to next term: 0 +4=4. Multiply by 1/2: 2. Add to next term: -24 +2= -22. Multiply by 1/2: -11. Add to last term: 11 + (-11)=0. \n\nSo, the quotient polynomial is 8x² +4x -22. Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 1/2)(8x² +4x -22)=0. \n\nSo, the solutions are x=1/2 and the roots of 8x² +4x -22=0. Let's solve 8x² +4x -22=0. Using quadratic formula: x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 704)] / (16) = [-4 ± sqrt(720)] /16. Simplify sqrt(720): sqrt(36*20)=6*sqrt(20)=6*2*sqrt(5)=12sqrt5. Wait, no. Wait, 720=36*20, so sqrt(720)=6*sqrt(20)=6*sqrt(4*5)=6*2*sqrt5=12sqrt5. Wait, no: sqrt(4*5)=2sqrt5. So, 6*2sqrt5=12sqrt5. So, sqrt(720)=12sqrt5. Therefore, x = [-4 ±12sqrt5]/16. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 4: [-1 ±3sqrt5]/4. So the roots are x=(-1 +3sqrt5)/4 and x=(-1 -3sqrt5)/4. \n\nBut wait, x is sinθ + cosθ. The maximum value of sinθ + cosθ is sqrt(2) ≈1.414, and the minimum is -sqrt(2)≈-1.414. Let's check the possible roots. \n\nx=1/2 is approximately 0.5, which is within the possible range. The other roots: (-1 +3sqrt5)/4. Let's compute 3sqrt5 ≈3*2.236≈6.708. So, -1 +6.708≈5.708. Divide by 4≈1.427. Which is approximately sqrt(2)≈1.414, so slightly higher. But sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1.427 is a bit larger. But is that possible? Wait, sinθ + cosθ can't exceed sqrt(2). So, that root is about 1.427, which is more than sqrt(2). Therefore, that's not possible. Similarly, (-1 -3sqrt5)/4≈(-1 -6.708)/4≈-7.708/4≈-1.927, which is less than -sqrt(2)≈-1.414, so that's also not possible. Therefore, the only valid solution is x=1/2. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that. Because when we squared x, we might have introduced extraneous solutions. But in this case, since we derived x=1/2 as a root, and the others are outside the possible range, so x=1/2 is the only valid solution. \n\nBut let's verify this. Let me plug x=1/2 back into the original equation to see if it works. So, if sinθ + cosθ =1/2, then sinθcosθ=(x² -1)/2=(1/4 -1)/2=(-3/4)/2=-3/8. Then, the original equation x(1 - sinθcosθ)=1/2*(1 - (-3/8))=1/2*(11/8)=11/16. Which matches the given equation. So, that works. \n\nTherefore, the value of sinθ + cosθ is 1/2. \n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible solution. Suppose x=1/2 is the only real solution within the valid range. The other roots are outside the possible range of sinθ + cosθ, so they can be discarded. Therefore, the answer is 1/2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. Another way to approach this problem is to let t = sinθ + cosθ, then we know that sin³θ + cos³θ can be expressed in terms of t. Let's see. \n\nWe have t = sinθ + cosθ. Then, as before, t² = 1 + 2sinθcosθ. So, sinθcosθ = (t² -1)/2. Then, sin³θ + cos³θ = t³ - 3t sinθ cosθ. Wait, because a³ + b³ = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b). So, yes, sin³θ + cos³θ = (sinθ + cosθ)^3 - 3 sinθ cosθ (sinθ + cosθ) = t³ - 3*( (t² -1)/2 )*t = t³ - (3t(t² -1))/2. \n\nSo, the original equation is t³ - (3t(t² -1))/2 = 11/16. Let's write that equation:\n\nt³ - (3t³ -3t)/2 = 11/16\n\nMultiply through by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n16t³ - 8(3t³ -3t) = 11\n\n16t³ -24t³ +24t =11\n\n-8t³ +24t =11\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-8t³ +24t -11 =0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n8t³ -24t +11 =0\n\nWhich is the same cubic equation as before. So, same solutions. So, as before, t=1/2 is the only valid solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/2. \n\nI think that's thorough. Let me just recap. The key was to recognize the sum of cubes formula, express the given equation in terms of t = sinθ + cosθ and sinθcosθ, then relate sinθcosθ to t using the square of t. This leads to a cubic equation in t, which can be solved. Since the other roots are outside the possible range, the only valid solution is t=1/2. Then, verifying by plugging back into the original equation confirms it works. \n\nSo, the answer is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation \\(\\sin^3 \\theta + \\cos^3 \\theta = \\frac{11}{16}\\), we need to find the value of \\(\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nFirst, we use the sum of cubes formula:\n\\[\n\\sin^3 \\theta + \\cos^3 \\theta = (\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta)(\\sin^2 \\theta - \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta)\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\), so substituting this into the equation gives:\n\\[\n(\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta)(1 - \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta) = \\frac{11}{16}\n\\]\nLet \\(x = \\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta\\).

So, the integral becomes ∫ from a to b of e^(x/a)/x dx minus ∫ from a to b of e^(x/b)/x dx.

Then, substituting, the integral becomes ∫ e^u / (a u) * a du = ∫ e^u / u du. That simplifies to a ∫ e^u / u du. Wait, that's the same as a times the exponential integral Ei(u) + C, right? But the exponential integral function Ei(z) is defined as -∫ from -z to ∞ of e^t/t dt for complex arguments. So, in this case, u is positive since x is between a and b, and a is positive. So, the integral ∫ e^u / u du is indeed Ei(u) + C. So, substituting back, the first integral becomes a Ei(x/a) evaluated from a to b.\n\nSimilarly, the second integral is ∫ e^(x/b)/x dx. Let me do the same substitution. Let v = x/b, so dv = dx/b, so dx = b dv. Then, the integral becomes ∫ e^v / (b v) * b dv = ∫ e^v / v dv = b Ei(v) + C. So, substituting back, the second integral is b Ei(x/b) evaluated from a to b.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the original integral is [a Ei(x/a) - b Ei(x/b)] evaluated from a to b. So, that would be a Ei(b/a) - a Ei(1) - [a Ei(a/a) - b Ei(b/b)].\n\nWait, let me check that again. When we evaluate the first integral from a to b, it's a [Ei(b/a) - Ei(a/a)]. Similarly, the second integral is b [Ei(b/b) - Ei(a/b)]. So, the entire expression is a Ei(b/a) - a Ei(1) - b [Ei(1) - Ei(a/b)].\n\nSimplifying that, distribute the b: a Ei(b/a) - a Ei(1) - b Ei(1) + b Ei(a/b). Combine like terms: a Ei(b/a) + b Ei(a/b) - (a + b) Ei(1). Hmm, is that the final answer? Let me verify.\n\nWait, let's step back. The integral is [a Ei(x/a) - b Ei(x/b)] from a to b. So, plugging in the limits:\n\nAt upper limit b: a Ei(b/a) - b Ei(b/b) = a Ei(b/a) - b Ei(1)\n\nAt lower limit a: a Ei(a/a) - b Ei(a/b) = a Ei(1) - b Ei(a/b)\n\nSubtracting lower limit from upper limit:\n\n[a Ei(b/a) - b Ei(1)] - [a Ei(1) - b Ei(a/b)] = a Ei(b/a) - b Ei(1) - a Ei(1) + b Ei(a/b)\n\nWhich is indeed a Ei(b/a) + b Ei(a/b) - (a + b) Ei(1). \n\nBut I wonder if there's a way to write this in terms of the exponential integral function evaluated at certain points or if there's a relationship between Ei(b/a) and Ei(a/b). However, unless there's some symmetry or substitution that relates them, I don't think they can be simplified further. So, maybe the answer is expressed in terms of the exponential integral function. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Bereken\" which is Dutch for \"Calculate.\" So, maybe it's expecting an expression in terms of the exponential integral function? Because if it's possible to express this in terms of elementary functions, but I don't see how. The integral ∫ e^(kx)/x dx is not an elementary function; it's the exponential integral Ei(kx). Therefore, unless there's a trick here that I'm missing, this might just be the answer expressed in terms of Ei.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a substitution that can relate the two terms. Let me try to see. Let me consider the original integral again:\n\n∫ from a to b [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] / x dx\n\nLet me make a substitution t = x/a, so x = a t, dx = a dt. Then, when x = a, t = 1; when x = b, t = b/a. So, the integral becomes:\n\n∫ from t=1 to t=b/a [e^t - e^(a t / b)] / (a t) * a dt = ∫ from 1 to b/a [e^t - e^(a t / b)] / t dt\n\nSimilarly, maybe another substitution for the other term. Let me see. Alternatively, let me consider if there's a substitution that can make the exponents related. Let me set u = x/a, so x = a u, dx = a du. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n∫ from u=1 to u=b/a [e^u - e^(u*(a/b))] / (a u) * a du = ∫ from 1 to b/a [e^u - e^( (a/b) u ) ] / u du\n\nHmm, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe set v = x/b, then x = b v, dx = b dv, leading to:\n\n∫ from v=a/b to v=1 [e^(b v /a) - e^v ] / (b v) * b dv = ∫ from a/b to 1 [e^( (b/a) v ) - e^v ] / v dv\n\nSo, combining both substitutions, the integral can be written as:\n\n∫ from 1 to b/a [e^t - e^( (a/b) t ) ] / t dt + ∫ from a/b to 1 [e^( (b/a) t ) - e^t ] / t dt\n\nBut adding these two integrals together, the terms might cancel out. Let's check:\n\nFirst integral: ∫ from 1 to c [e^t - e^(k t ) ] / t dt, where c = b/a and k = a/b.\n\nSecond integral: ∫ from k to 1 [e^(c t ) - e^t ] / t dt.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n∫ from 1 to c [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt + ∫ from k to 1 [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt\n\nWhere c = b/a and k = a/b. Let's make substitution in the second integral. Let u = t, then the second integral is ∫ from k to 1 [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt. If we reverse the limits of integration, multiplying by -1:\n\n- ∫ from 1 to k [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt = ∫ from k to 1 [e^t - e^{c t}]/t dt. Wait, no. Wait, reversing the limits:\n\n∫ from k to 1 = - ∫ from 1 to k. So, the second integral becomes - ∫ from 1 to k [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt. Therefore, adding the two integrals:\n\nFirst integral: ∫ from 1 to c [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt\n\nSecond integral: - ∫ from 1 to k [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt\n\nTherefore, combined:\n\n∫ from 1 to c [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt - ∫ from 1 to k [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt\n\n= [∫ from 1 to k [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt + ∫ from k to c [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt] - [∫ from 1 to k [e^{c t} - e^t]/t dt]\n\n= ∫ from 1 to k [e^t - e^{k t} - e^{c t} + e^t]/t dt + ∫ from k to c [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps if we consider the sum of both integrals, there's cancellation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original integral can be rewritten as:\n\n∫ from a to b [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] / x dx = ∫ from a to b e^(x/a)/x dx - ∫ from a to b e^(x/b)/x dx\n\nAs we did before, which gives a Ei(b/a) - a Ei(1) - b Ei(1) + b Ei(a/b). \n\nBut maybe there's a relationship between Ei(b/a) and Ei(a/b). Let me note that Ei(z) has some properties, like Ei(1/z) = -Ei(-z) - iπ for z with argument between 0 and π. But this might be complicated. Alternatively, integrating by parts. Let me try integrating each term by parts.\n\nTake the first integral: ∫ e^(x/a)/x dx. Let me set u = e^(x/a), dv = dx/x. Then du = (1/a) e^(x/a) dx, and v = ln x. So, integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = e^(x/a) ln x - (1/a) ∫ e^(x/a) ln x dx. Hmm, but this seems to lead to a more complicated integral. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we set t = x/a in the first integral, which we did before, leading to Ei(x/a). Similarly for the other integral. So, unless there's some identity or relation between Ei(b/a) and Ei(a/b), I don't think we can simplify further. \n\nAlternatively, check if the original integral can be expressed as the difference of two exponential integrals. Since Ei(z) is a standard special function, the answer is likely expressed in terms of Ei. So, maybe the answer is a Ei(b/a) + b Ei(a/b) - (a + b) Ei(1). \n\nBut let me verify with a specific case. Let me take a = b. Then the integral becomes ∫ from a to a [e^(x/a) - e^(x/a)] / x dx = 0. Plugging into our expression: a Ei(1) + a Ei(1) - (a + a) Ei(1) = 2a Ei(1) - 2a Ei(1) = 0. That checks out. \n\nAnother test case: let a = 1, b = e. Then the integral is ∫ from 1 to e [e^x - e^(x/e)] / x dx. According to our formula, it should be 1 * Ei(e/1) + e * Ei(1/e) - (1 + e) Ei(1). That's Ei(e) + e Ei(1/e) - (1 + e) Ei(1). Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, compute the integral numerically. But since I don't have exact values for Ei, maybe it's hard. But if I recall that Ei(e) is a known value, but unless there's a relationship, it's just expressed in terms of Ei functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me consider the integral ∫ [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] / x dx. Let me make substitution t = x/a, so x = a t, dx = a dt. Then, the integral becomes ∫ [e^t - e^(a t / b)] / (a t) * a dt = ∫ [e^t - e^( (a/b) t ) ] / t dt. Similarly, if I set s = x/b, then x = b s, dx = b ds, and the integral becomes ∫ [e^(b s /a) - e^s ] / s ds. So, the integral can be written as ∫ [e^t - e^{k t}]/t dt where k = a/b. But I don't see how this helps. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the integral from a to b of [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] / x dx, maybe there's a substitution that combines the two exponentials. Let me try setting y = x/a, so x = a y, dx = a dy. Then, the integral becomes ∫ from y=1 to y=b/a [e^y - e^{(a/b) y}]/y * a dy = a ∫ from 1 to c [e^y - e^{k y}]/y dy, where c = b/a and k = a/b. Similarly, if we set z = x/b, then the other term would be similar. But again, this seems to lead back to the same expression.\n\nAlternatively, if I set t = x/(ab), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe write the integral as ∫ [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] / x dx = ∫ [e^(x/a)/x - e^(x/b)/x] dx. If I consider the integral of e^(kx)/x dx, which is Ei(kx) + C, so then the integral is Ei(x/a) - Ei(x/b) evaluated from a to b. Wait, but in our previous calculation, we had a Ei(x/a) - b Ei(x/b). Wait, hold on. Wait, if I integrate e^(x/a)/x dx, that's a Ei(x/a) + C. Similarly, integrating e^(x/b)/x dx is b Ei(x/b) + C. Therefore, the integral from a to b of [e^(x/a) - e^(x/b)] /x dx is [a Ei(x/a)", "answer": "0"}

The formula is H - R + V = 2, where H is the number of faces, R the number of edges, and V the number of vertices. The problem states there's a convex polyhedron with 30 faces, all of which are quadrilaterals (four-sided polygons). I need to find:\n\n(a) The number of edges,\n(b) The number of vertices,\n(c) If every edge is shared by exactly two faces and each vertex is where three or five edges meet, how many vertices are there of each type.\n\nLet me start with part (a). Since all faces are quadrilaterals, each face has four edges. But wait, in a polyhedron, each edge is shared by exactly two faces. So, if I count all edges from each face, I have to divide by two to get the actual number of edges. Let me write that down.\n\nEach face is a quadrilateral, so each contributes 4 edges. Total edges counted per face: 30 * 4 = 120. But since each edge is shared by two faces, the actual number of edges R is 120 / 2 = 60. So, R = 60. That seems straightforward. Maybe part (a) is 60 edges. Let me check that again. Yes, each edge is shared by two faces, so dividing by two gives the correct count. So, answer to (a) is 60.\n\nMoving on to part (b), the number of vertices. Euler's formula is H - R + V = 2. We know H is 30, R is 60. Plugging those in: 30 - 60 + V = 2. That simplifies to -30 + V = 2, so V = 32. Wait, that seems too easy. Let me confirm. So, H - R + V = 2, so 30 - 60 + V = 2 => V = 2 + 60 - 30 = 32. Yeah, that's right. So part (b) is 32 vertices.\n\nNow part (c) is trickier. It says that each edge is shared by exactly two faces (which we already know), and each vertex is where three or five edges meet. So, we need to find how many vertices are of degree 3 and how many are of degree 5. Let's denote V3 as the number of vertices where three edges meet, and V5 as those where five edges meet. So, V3 + V5 = total vertices, which we found to be 32. So, V3 + V5 = 32.\n\nAlso, each vertex is part of several faces. For a convex polyhedron, each vertex is part of several faces. In this case, since all faces are quadrilaterals, each vertex must be part of at least three faces (since in a tetrahedron, which is a triangular face, each vertex is part of three edges, but here all faces are quadrilaterals). Wait, but actually, in a polyhedron with quadrilateral faces, the number of edges meeting at a vertex can vary. For example, in a cube, each vertex is where three edges meet. But maybe here, some vertices could be where five edges meet? Hmm.\n\nBut the problem states that each vertex is where exactly three or five edges meet. So, V3 is the number of vertices with three edges, and V5 is the number with five edges.\n\nAnother approach is to use the relationship between edges and vertices. Each edge is connected to two vertices. So, the total number of edge-vertex incidences is 2R. But each vertex has a degree (number of edges connected to it), so the sum of all vertex degrees is 2R. In this case, 2R = 2*60 = 120.\n\nBut each vertex is either degree 3 or 5. So, sum of degrees = 3V3 + 5V5 = 120.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. V3 + V5 = 32\n2. 3V3 + 5V5 = 120\n\nLet me solve these equations. From the first equation, V3 = 32 - V5. Substitute into the second equation:\n\n3(32 - V5) + 5V5 = 120\n\n96 - 3V5 + 5V5 = 120\n\n96 + 2V5 = 120\n\n2V5 = 24\n\nV5 = 12\n\nThen, V3 = 32 - 12 = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 vertices where three edges meet and 12 vertices where five edges meet.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. Let's verify the total degrees:\n\n3*20 + 5*12 = 60 + 60 = 120, which matches 2R = 120. So, that works.\n\nSo, part (c) answer is 20 vertices of degree 3 and 12 vertices of degree 5.\n\nBut let me think again if there's any other constraints. For example, in a polyhedron, can a vertex have degree 5? In regular polyhedrons, like the dodecahedron, each vertex is where three edges meet. But here, the polyhedron isn't necessarily regular. It just has quadrilateral faces. So, it's possible to have vertices of higher degree. For instance, in a cube, all vertices are degree 3. If you have a polyhedron with quadrilaterals, maybe you can have some vertices where more edges meet. So, the answer here seems feasible.\n\nAnother check: Let's consider the total number of face-vertex incidences. Each face is a quadrilateral, so each has four vertices. Total face-vertex incidences: 30*4 = 120. But each vertex is used in multiple faces. Since each vertex is part of, say, k faces, then the total face-vertex incidences is also equal to the sum over all vertices of their face degrees. But in a convex polyhedron, the number of faces meeting at a vertex is equal to the degree of the vertex. So, each vertex of degree 3 is part of three faces, each vertex of degree 5 is part of five faces. Therefore, total face-vertex incidences is 3V3 + 5V5 = 120, which is the same as before, so that's consistent.\n\nThus, part (c) is 20 and 12. So, summarizing:\n\n(a) 60 edges\n\n(b) 32 vertices\n\n(c) 20 vertices of degree 3 and 12 vertices of degree 5\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n1. (a) \\boxed{60}\n\n2. (b) \\boxed{32}\n\n3.

Wat is de som van al hun cijfers?**", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of all digits from 1 up to 10^2022. Hmm, that's a really big number. Let me start by understanding the problem better. The question is asking for the total sum of every digit when all numbers from 1 to 10^2022 are written out in decimal form. \n\nFirst, let me think about how numbers are structured. Each number from 1 to 10^2022 can be represented with up to 2022 digits, right? Because 10^2022 is a 1 followed by 2022 zeros, so numbers before that can have up to 2022 digits. But wait, actually, 10^2022 is the upper limit, so when we include it, do we have numbers with 2023 digits? Wait, no. 10^2022 is equal to 1 followed by 2022 zeros, which is a 2023-digit number. But the question says \"van 1 tot en met 10^2022\", so including 10^2022. So, numbers from 1 to 10^2022 inclusive. So, the maximum number of digits a number can have is 2023. But numbers from 1 to 10^2022 include numbers from 1-digit (1-9) up to 2023-digit numbers (10^2022 itself is a 2023-digit number). Wait, but 10^2022 - 1 is a 2022-digit number. So actually, numbers from 1 to 10^2022 include numbers with 1 digit up to 2023 digits. But the number 10^2022 is the only 2023-digit number, right? Because it's 1 followed by 2022 zeros. So, all other numbers up to 10^2022 have up to 2022 digits. Wait, no. Wait, 10^2022 is a 2023-digit number, but numbers from 1 to 10^2022 include numbers with 1 to 2023 digits. But actually, 10^2022 is exactly 2023 digits. So, numbers from 1 to 10^2022 include numbers with 1 digit (1-9), 2 digits (10-99), ..., up to 2023 digits (10^2022). So, the total numbers are 9 + 90 + 900 + ... + 1 (for the 2023-digit number). Wait, but how does that add up? Let me check:\n\nNumber of 1-digit numbers: 9 (1-9)\nNumber of 2-digit numbers: 90 (10-99)\nNumber of 3-digit numbers: 900 (100-999)\n...\nNumber of n-digit numbers: 9*10^(n-1) for n from 1 to 2022\nThen, the number 10^2022 is a 2023-digit number, so there's only 1 number in the 2023-digit category.\n\nSo, the total count is 9 + 90 + 900 + ... + 9*10^2021 + 1. But maybe that's not necessary right now. The problem is not about counting numbers but summing their digits.\n\nI remember that for problems like this, where you have to sum all digits from 1 to some number, there's a pattern or formula. Let me try to recall. For numbers from 1 to N, the sum of digits can be calculated by considering each digit position separately. For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often, except for the last number which might be incomplete. Similarly for the tens place, hundreds place, etc.\n\nBut in this case, N is 10^2022. Which is a power of 10, so maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think about numbers from 000...0 to 999...9 (with 2022 digits), which would be 10^2022 - 1. Then, adding 1 to reach 10^2022. But the problem is from 1 to 10^2022. So, perhaps we can consider numbers from 000...0 to 999...9 (2022 digits) which is 10^2022 numbers, but then subtract the digit sum of 0 (which is 0) and add the digit sum of 10^2022. Then, the total digit sum would be the digit sum from 000...0 to 999...9 plus the digit sum of 10^2022.\n\nBut how to compute the digit sum from 000...0 to 999...9. Each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. For each digit position, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10^2021 times. Because, for example, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 10^2021 times (since for each combination of the other 2021 digits, the units digit cycles through 0-9). Similarly for the tens place, hundreds place, etc. So, for each of the 2022 digit positions, the sum contributed by that position is (0+1+2+...+9) * 10^2021. The sum from 0 to 9 is 45. Therefore, each digit position contributes 45 * 10^2021. Since there are 2022 digit positions, the total digit sum is 45 * 10^2021 * 2022.\n\nBut wait, that's the digit sum from 000...0 to 999...9 (2022 digits). However, our original problem is from 1 to 10^2022. So, we need to adjust for that. The numbers from 000...0 to 999...9 include 0, which we don't want. The digit sum of 0 is 0, so the digit sum from 1 to 999...9 is the same as from 000...0 to 999...9. Then, we have to add the digit sum of 10^2022, which is 1 followed by 2022 zeros, so the digit sum is 1.\n\nTherefore, total digit sum from 1 to 10^2022 is 45 * 10^2021 * 2022 + 1.\n\nWait, let me verify this logic. If we consider numbers from 000...0 to 999...9 (2022 digits), which is 10^2022 numbers, each digit position (2022 in total) cycles 0-9 exactly 10^2021 times. Therefore, each digit position contributes 45 * 10^2021, so total digit sum is 45 * 10^2021 * 2022. But since we started from 0, which has digit sum 0, the digit sum from 1 to 999...9 is exactly the same as from 000...0 to 999...9. Then, adding 10^2022, which has digit sum 1, gives the total digit sum from 1 to 10^2022.\n\nBut wait, 10^2022 is a 2023-digit number. So, numbers from 1 to 10^2022 include numbers with 1 to 2023 digits. However, when we considered the numbers from 000...0 to 999...9, which is 2022 digits, we didn't account for the numbers with 2023 digits. Wait, no. Wait, 10^2022 is a 2023-digit number, but when we write numbers from 1 to 10^2022, the numbers with 2023 digits is only 10^2022 itself. The rest are from 1 to 999...9 (2022 digits). Wait, but 999...9 (2022 digits) is 10^2022 - 1. So, numbers from 1 to 10^2022 - 1 are all 2022-digit numbers or less. Then, 10^2022 is the only 2023-digit number. Therefore, the digit sum from 1 to 10^2022 is equal to the digit sum from 1 to 999...9 (2022 digits) plus the digit sum of 10^2022. \n\nBut earlier, when I considered numbers from 000...0 to 999...9 (2022 digits), that's 10^2022 numbers, including 0. But the numbers from 1 to 999...9 (2022 digits) is 10^2022 - 1 numbers. So, the digit sum from 1 to 999...9 would be equal to the digit sum from 000...0 to 999...9 minus the digit sum of 0, which is 0. So, it's still 45 * 10^2021 * 2022. Then, adding the digit sum of 10^2022, which is 1, gives the total digit sum from 1 to 10^2022. Therefore, the total digit sum is 45 * 10^2021 * 2022 + 1.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this formula works. Let's take N = 10^1, which is 10. Then, numbers from 1 to 10. The digit sums are:\n\n1:1, 2:2, ..., 9:9, 10:1+0=1. Total sum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1 = 46. \n\nUsing the formula: 45 * 10^(1-1) * 1 + 1 = 45 * 1 * 1 + 1 = 46. Which matches. Good.\n\nAnother test: N = 10^2 = 100. Numbers from 1 to 100. The digit sum from 1 to 99 is calculated as follows: Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place and 10 times in the units place (for numbers 00 to 99). But since we're starting from 1, maybe the digit sum from 1 to 99 is (45*10 + 45*10) - (0+0) = 900. Then adding 100, which is 1+0+0=1. Total sum: 901. \n\nUsing the formula: 45 * 10^(2-1) * 2 + 1 = 45 * 10 * 2 +1 = 900 +1 = 901. Correct again.\n\nAnother test: N = 10^3 = 1000. The digit sum from 1 to 999. Each digit position (hundreds, tens, units) has each digit 0-9 appearing 100 times. So, each position contributes 45*100. Three positions: 45*100*3 = 13500. Then, adding 1000 (digit sum 1). Total sum: 13500 +1 = 13501. \n\nFormula: 45 * 10^(3-1) *3 +1 = 45*100*3 +1 = 13500 +1 =13501. Correct. \n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, generalizing, for N = 10^n, the digit sum from 1 to 10^n is 45 * 10^(n-1) * n +1. \n\nTherefore, in our problem, n =2022. So, the answer should be 45 *10^(2022-1)*2022 +1 = 45*10^2021*2022 +1. \n\nBut let me write that in terms of exponents. 45 *2022 is 45*2000 +45*22=90,000 +990=90,990. Therefore, the total digit sum is 90,990 *10^2021 +1. \n\nBut 90,990 *10^2021 can be written as 9.099*10^4 *10^2021=9.099*10^2025. But maybe it's better to leave it in the original form. However, the problem asks for the sum, so as per the instructions, the answer should be boxed. Since the problem is in Dutch, but the answer is a number, so we need to compute it. But 90,990 *10^2021 +1 is a number that starts with 90990 followed by 2021 zeros and then a 1. But that's athonormal; we can't write that here. Wait, no. Wait, 90,990 *10^2021 is 90990 followed by 2021 zeros. Then adding 1 would make the last digit 1, so it's 90990 followed by 2021 zeros and a 1. But writing that number in boxed form is impossible here. Wait, but maybe the problem", "answer": "10^{2022}"}

Wat is die som?**", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the product of four prime numbers is ten times as large as their sum. We need to find the sum of these primes. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\nFirst, let's denote the four prime numbers as p, q, r, s. So according to the problem, p * q * r * s = 10 * (p + q + r + s). Our goal is to find p + q + r + s. \n\nSince primes are mostly odd numbers, except for 2, which is even. The product of four primes being ten times their sum. Let's think about the parity here. If all primes are odd, then their product would be odd (since odd*odd*odd*odd = odd), and their sum would be even (since odd + odd + odd + odd = even). But the problem states that the product is ten times the sum. Ten times an even number is even, but the product would be odd if all primes are odd. That's a contradiction. Therefore, at least one of the primes must be 2 to make the product even. \n\nSo, one of the primes is 2. Let's say p = 2. Then the equation becomes 2 * q * r * s = 10 * (2 + q + r + s). Simplify both sides: divide both sides by 2, we get q * r * s = 5 * (2 + q + r + s). \n\nNow, since q, r, s are primes greater than or equal to 2. Let's think about possible primes here. Let's consider that 5 is a prime, so maybe one of the primes is 5. Let's try q = 5. Then the equation becomes 5 * r * s = 5 * (2 + 5 + r + s). Simplify: divide both sides by 5, we get r * s = 2 + 5 + r + s → r * s = 7 + r + s. Rearranging: r * s - r - s = 7. Adding 1 to both sides: (r - 1)(s - 1) = 8. \n\nSo now, (r - 1)(s - 1) = 8. Since r and s are primes greater than or equal to 2, (r - 1) and (s - 1) must be positive integers. Let's list the pairs of integers that multiply to 8: (1,8), (2,4), (4,2), (8,1). \n\nSo, possible solutions:\n1. (r - 1) = 1 and (s - 1) = 8 → r = 2, s = 9. But 9 is not a prime.\n2. (r - 1) = 2 and (s - 1) = 4 → r = 3, s = 5. Both primes.\n3. (r - 1) = 4 and (s - 1) = 2 → r = 5, s = 3. Both primes.\n4. (r - 1) = 8 and (s - 1) = 1 → r = 9, s = 2. But 9 is not a prime.\n\nSo the valid solutions are r = 3 and s = 5 or r = 5 and s = 3. So the primes are 2, 5, 3, 5 or 2, 5, 5, 3. Either way, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 5. Let's check the product and sum: 2*3*5*5 = 150. The sum is 2+3+5+5 = 15. 10 times the sum is 150. Yes, that works. So the sum is 15. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are other possibilities. Maybe if we didn't assume that q = 5. Suppose instead that one of the primes is 5, but not q. Let's say the primes are 2, 5, p, q. Then the equation would be 2*5*p*q = 10*(2 + 5 + p + q) → 10*p*q = 10*(7 + p + q) → p*q = 7 + p + q. Then similar to before, p*q - p - q = 7 → (p - 1)(q - 1) = 8. So same as before. So same solutions: p and q would be 2 and 9 (invalid), 3 and 5, or 5 and 3. So same result. So regardless of which prime we set as 5 initially, we end up with the same primes. \n\nAlternatively, what if we considered two 2s? Let's say the primes are 2, 2, r, s. Then the product is 2*2*r*s = 4rs. The sum is 2 + 2 + r + s = 4 + r + s. According to the problem, 4rs = 10*(4 + r + s). Let's divide both sides by 2: 2rs = 5*(4 + r + s). Hmm, 2rs = 20 + 5r + 5s. Let's rearrange: 2rs -5r -5s =20. Not sure if that helps. Maybe factor in some way. Let's try to rearrange: 2rs -5r -5s =20. Maybe add 25/2 to both sides to complete the rectangle? Not sure. Let's try specific primes. Let's assume r and s are primes greater than 2. Let's try r=3: 2*3*s -5*3 -5s =20 →6s -15 -5s =20 →s -15=20→s=35. Not prime. r=5: 2*5*s -5*5 -5s=20→10s -25 -5s=20→5s=45→s=9. Not prime. r=7: 2*7*s -5*7 -5s=20→14s -35 -5s=20→9s=55→s≈6.11. Not integer. r=11: 22s -55 -5s=20→17s=75→s≈4.41. Not integer. So no solution here. So two 2s don't work. \n\nWhat if there are three 2s? Let's see: primes are 2,2,2,r. Product:8r. Sum:6 + r. Equation:8r =10*(6 + r) →8r=60 +10r→-2r=60→r=-30. Not possible. So three 2s don't work. \n\nWhat if we have a different prime instead of 5? Let's say the primes are 2, 7, p, q. Then product is 14pq. Sum is 2 +7 + p + q =9 + p + q. Equation:14pq =10*(9 + p + q). Let's divide both sides by 2:7pq =5*(9 + p + q). Hmm, 7pq =45 +5p +5q. Let's rearrange:7pq -5p -5q =45. Not sure. Let's try small primes. Let's try p=3: 7*3*q -5*3 -5q=45→21q -15 -5q=45→16q=60→q=3.75. Not integer. p=5:7*5*q -5*5 -5q=45→35q -25 -5q=45→30q=70→q≈2.33. Not integer. p=7:7*7*q -5*7 -5q=45→49q -35 -5q=45→44q=80→q≈1.818. Not integer. So no solution here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2, 3, 7, r. Product is 42r. Sum is 12 + r. Equation:42r=10*(12 + r)→42r=120 +10r→32r=120→r=3.75. Not prime. So no. \n\nAlternatively, let's try primes 2, 3, 11, r. Product 66r. Sum 16 + r. Equation:66r=10*(16 + r)→66r=160 +10r→56r=160→r≈2.857. Not integer. \n\nSo seems like the only possible primes are 2,3,5,5. Let me verify again. Product:2*3*5*5=150. Sum:2+3+5+5=15. 10 times the sum is 150. Yep, matches. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a different combination with more 5s? Let's try 2,5,5,5. Product:2*5*5*5=250. Sum:2+5+5+5=17. 10*17=170. Not equal. \n\nOr 2,3,3,5. Product:2*3*3*5=90. Sum:2+3+3+5=13. 10*13=130. Not equal. \n\nOr 2,3,5,7. Product:210. Sum:17. 10*17=170. Not equal. \n\nWait, 2,3,3,5: product 90 vs 130. Nope. \n\nAlternatively, 2,5,7, something. Product:70* something. Sum:14 + something. 70* something =10*(14 + something). Let's see:70s=140 +10s→60s=140→s≈2.33. Not prime. \n\nHmm. So seems like the only possible primes are 2,3,5,5. Their sum is 15. \n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. What if one of the primes is 2, another is 5, and the other two are 2 and 3? Wait, but then primes would be 2,2,3,5. Product:2*2*3*5=60. Sum:2+2+3+5=12. 10*12=120. Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, 2,2,5,5. Product:100. Sum:14. 10*14=140. Not equal. \n\nSo no. So seems like the only possible solution is 2,3,5,5. So the sum is 15. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are other primes. Let's suppose three primes are 2, 3, 5. Then the fourth prime would need to satisfy 2*3*5*s =10*(2+3+5+s). So 30s=10*(10 +s)→30s=100 +10s→20s=100→s=5. So primes are 2,3,5,5. Which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if two primes are 2 and 3. Then product is 6*r*s. Sum is 2+3+r+s=5 + r + s. Equation:6rs=10*(5 +r +s). Let's divide by 2:3rs=5*(5 +r +s). So 3rs=25 +5r +5s. Let's rearrange:3rs -5r -5s=25. Hmm. Let's try possible primes. Let's say r=5: 3*5*s -5*5 -5s=25→15s -25 -5s=25→10s=50→s=5. So primes are 2,3,5,5. Again same solution. \n\nAlternatively, r=7: 3*7*s -5*7 -5s=25→21s -35 -5s=25→16s=60→s=3.75. Not prime. \n\nr=11: 3*11*s -5*11 -5s=25→33s -55 -5s=25→28s=80→s≈2.857. Not prime. \n\nr=2: 3*2*s -5*2 -5s=25→6s -10 -5s=25→s=35. Not prime. \n\nr=3: 3*3*s -5*3 -5s=25→9s -15 -5s=25→4s=40→s=10. Not prime. \n\nSo only possible solution here is r=5 and s=5. So again, the same primes. \n\nTherefore, the only possible primes are 2,3,5,5. Their sum is 15. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the four prime numbers is \\boxed{15}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that the product of four prime numbers is ten times their sum, we need to find the sum of these primes. \n\nFirst, denote the prime numbers as \\( p, q, r, s \\). The equation given is:\n\\[ p \\times q \\times r \\times s = 10 \\times (p + q + r + s) \\]\n\nSince primes are mostly odd, but the product on the left must be even (as it is ten times the sum, which is even), at least one of the primes must be 2. Let \\( p = 2 \\). The equation simplifies to:\n\\[ 2 \\times q \\times r \\times s = 10 \\times (2 + q + r + s) \\]\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ q \\times r \\times s = 5 \\times (2 + q + r + s) \\]\n\nNext, consider that one of the primes must be 5 (since 5 is a", "answer": "15"}

Right, the determinant of a matrix depends on how the elements are arranged. For a 3x3 matrix, the determinant formula is a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to maximize it by strategically placing the πs and 0s.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the determinant of a matrix is maximized when the rows (or columns) are orthogonal to each other. That is, if the rows are orthogonal vectors, the determinant would be the product of their lengths. Since each element is either 0 or π, maybe arranging πs such that the rows are orthogonal?\n\nBut wait, all entries are either 0 or π. So each row is a vector with entries 0 or π. If two rows are orthogonal, their dot product is zero. So, for example, if one row has π in certain positions, another row should have 0 in those positions to make the dot product zero. But since each entry is either 0 or π, maybe arranging the πs in different columns for different rows?\n\nLet me think. For a 3x3 matrix, if I set each row to have a single π in a different column, then the columns would each have a single π as well. That would make the matrix a diagonal matrix with πs on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal entries. So if all diagonal entries are π, then the determinant would be π^3. But wait, is that possible? Let me check.\n\nIf the matrix is:\n\n[π, 0, 0]\n[0, π, 0]\n[0, 0, π]\n\nThen the determinant is π*π*π = π³. That seems straightforward. But is there a way to get a higher determinant? Because maybe arranging the πs in a different way could lead to a higher determinant. For example, if the matrix is a permutation matrix scaled by π, then the determinant is ±π³. But the maximum absolute value would still be π³. However, if the matrix is not diagonal but still has orthogonal rows, maybe we can get a higher determinant?\n\nWait, but in the case of orthogonal rows, the determinant is the product of the lengths of the rows times the determinant of the orthogonal matrix. Since orthogonal matrices have determinant ±1, the absolute determinant would be the product of the lengths. So to maximize the determinant, we need to maximize the product of the lengths of the rows. Each row's length is the square root of the number of πs in that row. So if each row has one π, the length is π, so the product is π³. If a row has two πs, the length would be sqrt(2)π, but then another row can't have πs in the same columns, so maybe it has two πs in different columns. Wait, but if two rows have two πs each, but in different columns, then they might not be orthogonal. Let me try.\n\nSuppose we have two rows with two πs each. For example:\n\nFirst row: π, π, 0\nSecond row: π, 0, π\nThird row: 0, π, π\n\nBut wait, then the first and second rows have π in the first column, so their dot product is π², which is not zero. So they are not orthogonal. So the determinant would not just be the product of the lengths. In this case, the determinant might be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the πs such that each row and column has exactly one π. That's a permutation matrix scaled by π, so determinant is ±π³. So maybe that gives the maximum determinant. But is there a way to get a higher determinant by having some rows or columns with more πs?\n\nWait, let's think of another example. Suppose we have a matrix where two rows have two πs each, but arranged such that their dot product is zero. For example:\n\nRow 1: π, π, 0\nRow 2: π, -π, 0\nBut we can't have negative entries; all entries are 0 or π. So that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we can arrange the πs in such a way that the rows are orthogonal vectors. For example, in 3D space, orthogonal vectors can have different numbers of πs. Let me think of orthogonal vectors in 3D with entries 0 or π. For example, (π, 0, 0) and (0, π, 0) are orthogonal. Similarly, (π, 0, 0) and (0, 0, π) are orthogonal. But if we have three vectors, each with one π, then they form an orthogonal set. However, if we have vectors with more πs, maybe we can get a higher determinant?\n\nWait, the determinant is a scalar triple product of the rows (or columns). So if the rows are orthogonal, the determinant is the product of their lengths. So to maximize the determinant, we need to maximize the product of the lengths of the rows, given that each row is a vector with entries 0 or π.\n\nEach row can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 πs. The length of a row with k πs is sqrt(k)π. So the product of the lengths would be sqrt(k1)π * sqrt(k2)π * sqrt(k3)π = π³ * sqrt(k1 k2 k3). So to maximize this, we need to maximize sqrt(k1 k2 k3). However, we must also ensure that the rows are orthogonal. Because if they are not orthogonal, the determinant might be less than the product of the lengths.\n\nBut the problem is to find the maximum determinant, regardless of orthogonality, right? Wait, no. The determinant is maximized when the rows are orthogonal because of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The determinant of a matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by its rows, and this volume is maximized when the vectors are orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, if we can arrange the rows to be orthogonal, then we can achieve the maximum determinant, which would be the product of their lengths. So in order to maximize the determinant, we need to maximize the product of the lengths of the rows, given that each entry is 0 or π, and the rows are orthogonal.\n\nSo each row is a vector with entries 0 or π, and they are orthogonal. So the dot product between any two different rows is zero.\n\nLet me consider possible configurations.\n\nCase 1: Each row has exactly one π. Then the rows are orthogonal if each π is in a different column. For example:\n\nRow 1: π, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, π, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, π\n\nThis is the diagonal matrix case. The determinant is π³. The product of the lengths is π * π * π = π³. So in this case, the determinant equals the product of the lengths.\n\nCase 2: One row has two πs, and another row has two πs, but in different columns. Let's say:\n\nRow 1: π, π, 0\nRow 2: π, 0, π\nRow 3: 0, π, π\n\nBut as before, the dot product between Row 1 and Row 2 is π² + 0 + 0 = π² ≠ 0. So they are not orthogonal. Therefore, the determinant here would not be the product of the lengths. Let's compute the determinant to see.\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n|π π 0|\n|π 0 π|\n|0 π π|\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\nπ * det([0 π], [π π]) - π * det([π π], [0 π]) + 0 * det(...)\n\nFirst term: π*(0*π - π*π) = π*(-π²) = -π³\n\nSecond term: -π*(π*π - 0*π) = -π*(π²) = -π³\n\nThird term: 0\n\nTotal determinant: -π³ - π³ + 0 = -2π³. Absolute value is 2π³. Wait, that's larger than π³. Hmm, so in this case, even though the rows are not orthogonal, the determinant is 2π³. So that's higher. So maybe this is a better configuration?\n\nBut wait, how come? The rows are not orthogonal, but the determinant is higher? That seems contradictory to the idea that orthogonal rows maximize the determinant. But maybe not. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the determinant for the matrix:\n\nRow 1: π, π, 0\n\nRow 2: π, 0, π\n\nRow 3: 0, π, π\n\nUsing cofactor expansion along the first row:\n\nC11: det of minor matrix for element (1,1): [0 π; π π] = 0*π - π*π = -π²\n\nC12: -det of minor matrix for element (1,2): [π π; 0 π] = π*π - π*0 = π²\n\nC13: det of minor matrix for element (1,3): [π 0; 0 π] = π*π - 0*0 = π²\n\nSo the determinant is π*(C11) + π*(C12) + 0*(C13) = π*(-π²) + π*(π²) + 0 = -π³ + π³ = 0. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me use another method. Let's use matrix operations to compute the determinant.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[π π 0]\n\n[π 0 π]\n\n[0 π π]\n\nLet's perform row operations to simplify. Subtract the first row from the second row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - Row1:\n\n[π π 0]\n\n[0 -π π]\n\n[0 π π]\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same. Now expand along the first column, which has π, 0, 0. The determinant is π * det of the minor:\n\n[ -π π ]\n\n[ π π ]\n\nDeterminant of that 2x2 matrix: (-π)(π) - (π)(π) = -π² - π² = -2π²\n\nSo total determinant is π*(-2π²) = -2π³. But when I did cofactor expansion earlier, I thought it was 0, but now it's -2π³. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cofactor expansion.\n\nWait, let's do cofactor expansion again carefully.\n\nFirst row, first column element: π. The minor is:\n\n[0 π]\n\n[π π]\n\nDeterminant: 0*π - π*π = -π². So cofactor is (+1)^{1+1} * (-π²) = -π²\n\nSecond element in first row: π. Minor is:\n\n[π π]\n\n[0 π]\n\nDeterminant: π*π - π*0 = π². Cofactor is (-1)^{1+2} * π² = -π²\n\nThird element in first row: 0. Minor is:\n\n[π 0]\n\n[0 π]\n\nDeterminant: π*π - 0*0 = π². Cofactor is (+1)^{1+3} * π² = π²\n\nSo total determinant: π*(-π²) + π*(-π²) + 0*(π²) = -π³ - π³ + 0 = -2π³. Okay, that matches the row operation result. So determinant is -2π³. The absolute value is 2π³, which is higher than π³. So that's better.\n\nSo in this case, even though the rows are not orthogonal, the determinant is higher. So maybe the maximum determinant is higher than π³. So how is this possible?\n\nWait, but maybe there's an error in reasoning here. Let me think.\n\nIn the case where the rows are orthogonal, the determinant is the product of the lengths. But here, the rows are not orthogonal, but the determinant is higher. So this shows that orthogonal rows might not necessarily give the maximum determinant. But why?\n\nBecause the determinant depends on both the lengths of the rows and the angles between them. If the rows are orthogonal, the determinant is the product of the lengths. If they are not orthogonal, the determinant is less than or equal to the product of the lengths (by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). Wait, but in our case, the determinant here is 2π³, which is greater than π³. But according to the inequality, the determinant should be less than or equal to the product of the lengths. Wait, but here the product of the lengths is sqrt(2)π * sqrt(2)π * π = 2π³. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, the first row has two πs, so its length is sqrt(2)π. The second row has two πs, length sqrt(2)π. The third row has one π, length π. So the product of the lengths is sqrt(2)π * sqrt(2)π * π = 2π³. And the determinant is -2π³, so absolute value is 2π³. So in this case, the determinant is equal to the product of the lengths. So even though the rows are not orthogonal, the determinant is equal to the product of the lengths. That's interesting. So in this case, the rows are not orthogonal, but the determinant is equal to the product of the lengths. So that's possible?\n\nWait, but how? If the rows are not orthogonal, how can the determinant be equal to the product of the lengths? That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the case of orthogonal rows, the determinant is the product of the lengths. If the rows are not orthogonal, then the determinant is less than the product of the lengths. But here, the determinant is equal to the product of the lengths. So that's possible only if the rows are orthogonal. Wait, but in our example, the rows are not orthogonal. So how is the determinant equal to the product of the lengths?\n\nWait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rows are:\n\nRow1: [π, π, 0], length sqrt(2)π\n\nRow2: [π, 0, π], length sqrt(2)π\n\nRow3: [0, π, π], length sqrt(2)π\n\nWait, hold on! The third row is [0, π, π], which also has length sqrt(2)π. So all three rows have length sqrt(2)π. But the rows are not orthogonal. Wait, but if all three rows have the same length and are not orthogonal, can the determinant still be equal to the product of the lengths?\n\nWait, let's compute the determinant again.\n\nMatrix:\n\nπ π 0\n\nπ 0 π\n\n0 π π\n\nLet me compute the determinant step by step.\n\nFirst, expand along the first row:\n\nπ *", "answer": "2\\pi^{3}"}

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's write down the integral again to make sure I have it right:\n\n∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 + 2020x)] dx.\n\nSo the integrand is x^2020 over (1 + 2020x). The limits are from -1 to 1. The exponent on x is 2020, which is an even number. The denominator is 1 plus 2020x. Hmm. Let me see.\n\nIntegrating a rational function like this might be tricky. Maybe there's a substitution or symmetry here. Let's check if the function has any symmetry properties. The interval from -1 to 1 is symmetric around 0. Let's see if the integrand is even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x), and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x). Let's compute f(-x):\n\nf(-x) = [(-x)^2020] / [1 + 2020(-x)] = [x^2020] / [1 - 2020x].\n\nComparing to the original f(x) = x^2020 / (1 + 2020x), they are not the same. So the integrand is not even. However, maybe we can split the integral into two parts: from -1 to 0 and from 0 to 1, and see if there's a way to relate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a substitution can help. Let me consider substituting t = -x. Let's try that.\n\nLet t = -x. Then when x = -1, t = 1; when x = 1, t = -1. The limits of integration would switch, so we would need to reverse them, which introduces a negative sign. So:\n\n∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 + 2020x)] dx = ∫ from 1 to -1 [(-t)^2020 / (1 + 2020(-t))] (-dt) = ∫ from -1 to 1 [t^2020 / (1 - 2020t)] dt.\n\nSo the integral becomes ∫ from -1 to 1 [t^2020 / (1 - 2020t)] dt. Hmm, interesting. So if we denote the original integral as I, then we have:\n\nI = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - 2020x)] dx.\n\nWait, but earlier, when we substituted t = -x, we ended up with I = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - 2020x)] dx. So that gives us:\n\nI = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - 2020x)] dx.\n\nBut the original integral was I = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 + 2020x)] dx. So combining these two expressions for I, we have:\n\nI = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 + 2020x)] dx = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - 2020x)] dx.\n\nTherefore, if we add these two equations together:\n\n2I = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 + 2020x) + x^2020 / (1 - 2020x)] dx.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\nx^2020 [1/(1 + 2020x) + 1/(1 - 2020x)] = x^2020 [ (1 - 2020x + 1 + 2020x) / ((1 + 2020x)(1 - 2020x)) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n1 - 2020x + 1 + 2020x = 2.\n\nDenominator:\n\n(1 + 2020x)(1 - 2020x) = 1 - (2020x)^2 = 1 - 2020²x².\n\nTherefore, the integrand simplifies to:\n\nx^2020 * [2 / (1 - (2020)^2 x²)].\n\nSo, 2I = 2 ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - (2020)^2 x²)] dx.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the 2 from the numerator and the denominator's (1 - (2020)^2 x²). Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, numerator is 2, denominator is 1 - (2020x)^2. So the integrand is x^2020 * 2 / (1 - (2020)^2 x²). Therefore:\n\n2I = 2 ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - (2020)^2 x²)] dx.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nI = ∫ from -1 to 1 [x^2020 / (1 - (2020)^2 x²)] dx.\n\nHmm, so now the integral is x^2020 over (1 - (2020)^2 x²). That seems like a different function. Maybe this can be simplified further? Let's see.\n\nNote that 1 - (2020)^2 x² can be written as (1 - 2020x)(1 + 2020x). Wait, but that's the original denominator multiplied. Wait, but here we have 1 - (2020x)^2 = (1 - 2020x)(1 + 2020x). So perhaps that's not helpful here. Alternatively, maybe we can perform a substitution here.\n\nLet me think. Let's set u = 2020x. Then du = 2020 dx, so dx = du / 2020. Then, when x = -1, u = -2020; when x = 1, u = 2020. The integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫ from u=-2020 to u=2020 [ (u/2020)^2020 / (1 - u²) ] * (du / 2020).\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, (u/2020)^2020 = u^2020 / 2020^2020.\n\nMultiply by 1/2020: so overall, 1 / 2020^2021 * ∫ from -2020 to 2020 [ u^2020 / (1 - u²) ] du.\n\nSo I = (1 / 2020^2021) ∫ from -2020 to 2020 [ u^2020 / (1 - u²) ] du.\n\nHmm, that might not be immediately helpful, but perhaps we can analyze the integral ∫ [u^2020 / (1 - u²)] du from -2020 to 2020. Let's check the integrand's symmetry.\n\nLet’s see if the function u^2020 / (1 - u²) is even or odd. Let's compute f(-u):\n\nf(-u) = (-u)^2020 / (1 - (-u)^2) = u^2020 / (1 - u²) = f(u). So yes, it's even. Therefore, the integral from -2020 to 2020 is twice the integral from 0 to 2020.\n\nTherefore, I = (1 / 2020^2021) * 2 ∫ from 0 to 2020 [ u^2020 / (1 - u²) ] du.\n\nBut integrating u^2020 / (1 - u²) from 0 to 2020... Hmm. This seems complicated. The denominator here is 1 - u², which is a polynomial, but the numerator is u^2020. Let's see if partial fractions can be applied here.\n\nBut 1 - u² factors as (1 - u)(1 + u). However, since the degree of the numerator is 2020, which is higher than the degree of the denominator (2), we can perform polynomial long division to split this into a polynomial plus a proper fraction.\n\nSo let's divide u^2020 by 1 - u². Let's write:\n\nu^2020 = (1 - u²) Q(u) + R(u),\n\nwhere Q(u) is the quotient and R(u) is the remainder, which must be of degree less than 2. So R(u) = au + b.\n\nBut since u^2020 is an even function and 1 - u² is even, then the quotient Q(u) should be even, and the remainder R(u) should also be even. Wait, because if we divide an even function by an even function, the quotient and remainder should both be even. Let me check:\n\nWait, u^2020 is even, 1 - u² is even. Let's suppose that Q(u) is even and R(u) is even. Then:\n\nu^2020 = (1 - u²) Q(u) + R(u).\n\nSince both sides are even, this holds. Therefore, Q(u) and R(u) must be even. Therefore, R(u) is a constant, because it's even and of degree less than 2. So R(u) = b. Therefore:\n\nu^2020 = (1 - u²) Q(u) + b.\n\nTo find b, let's plug in u = 1. Then:\n\n1^2020 = (1 - 1²) Q(1) + b => 1 = 0*Q(1) + b => b = 1.\n\nSimilarly, plug in u = -1, same result. So R(u) = 1. Therefore:\n\nu^2020 = (1 - u²) Q(u) + 1.\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\nu^2020 - 1 = (1 - u²) Q(u).\n\nTherefore, Q(u) = (u^2020 - 1)/(1 - u²). But 1 - u² divides u^2020 - 1 because u^2020 - 1 = (u²)^1010 - 1 = (u² - 1)(u^{2018} + u^{2016} + ... + u² + 1). Therefore, Q(u) = u^{2018} + u^{2016} + ... + u² + 1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nu^2020 / (1 - u²) = Q(u) + 1/(1 - u²).\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n∫ [u^2020 / (1 - u²)] du = ∫ Q(u) du + ∫ [1/(1 - u²)] du.\n\nSo, ∫ [u^2020 / (1 - u²)] du = ∫ (u^{2018} + u^{2016} + ... + u² + 1) du + ∫ [1/(1 - u²)] du.\n\nThe first integral is straightforward: integrating term by term, we get (u^{2019}/2019 + u^{2017}/2017 + ... + u³/3 + u) + C.\n\nThe second integral, ∫1/(1 - u²) du, is a standard integral: (1/2) ln |(1 + u)/(1 - u)| + C.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the integral from 0 to 2020 of [u^2020 / (1 - u²)] du is equal to:\n\n[ (u^{2019}/2019 + u^{2017}/2017 + ... + u³/3 + u) + (1/2) ln |(1 + u)/(1 - u)| ) ] evaluated from 0 to 2020.\n\nBut wait, plugging in u = 2020 here would be problematic because the denominator 1 - u² becomes negative, and the logarithm would involve complex numbers. Wait, but we are integrating from 0 to 2020, and u is real. However, when u > 1, the denominator 1 - u² is negative, so the integrand u^2020 / (1 - u²) is negative for u > 1. But the original integral I was supposed to compute is from -1 to 1, which is real. However, when we made substitution u = 2020x, we extended the limits to -2020 to 2020, but that's not the original interval. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the substitution step, we set u = 2020x, so when x is between -1 and 1, u is between -2020 and 2020. But in that substitution, we ended up with an integral from -2020 to 2020, but that's not correct because when x approaches 1, u approaches 2020, but the original integrand in x is defined at x=1 (since denominator is 1 + 2020*1 = 2021 ≠ 0). Wait, but actually, when x is in [-1,1], u = 2020x is in [-2020, 2020]. However, the integrand u^2020 / (1 - u²) has singularities at u = 1 and u = -1. Wait, but in the substitution u = 2020x, the original integral is transformed into an integral over u from -2020 to 2020, but the integrand has poles at u = 1 and u = -1.

Let me read it again and make sure I understand. The sequence x_n is defined recursively with two cases: if x_n is less than 2, then the next term is 3x_n + 1; if x_n is 2 or more, the next term is x_n divided by 2. We start with x_0 being non-negative, and we need to find the limit points of this sequence. \n\nHmm, limit points, right. If I remember correctly, a limit point of a sequence is a point where there's a subsequence that converges to it. So, even if the sequence doesn't converge itself, there might be points that the sequence gets arbitrarily close to infinitely often. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try to see what happens with different starting values of x_0. Let's try some examples. Let's start with x_0 = 0. Then, x_1 would be 3*0 + 1 = 1. Then x_2 is 3*1 + 1 = 4. Since 4 is greater than or equal to 2, x_3 is 4/2 = 2. Then x_4 is 2/2 = 1. Then x_5 is 3*1 + 1 = 4, and so on. So starting from 0, the sequence goes 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, etc. It cycles between 1, 4, 2. So the limit points here would be 1, 2, and 4? Because the subsequence keeps cycling through those numbers. So if you take every other term or something, you can get convergence to each of these. Wait, but actually, in this case, the sequence doesn't converge to any single limit, but it does have three limit points: 1, 2, and 4. \n\nLet me try another starting value. How about x_0 = 2. Then x_1 is 2/2 = 1. Then x_2 is 4, x_3 is 2, x_4 is 1, and so on. Same cycle: 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4... So again, the limit points are 1, 2, 4. \n\nWhat if x_0 is 1? Then x_1 is 4, x_2 is 2, x_3 is 1, and then it cycles again. So same thing. \n\nHow about a starting value that's not an integer? Let's say x_0 = 0.5. Then x_1 = 3*0.5 + 1 = 2.5. Then x_2 = 2.5 / 2 = 1.25. Then x_3 = 1.25 / 2 = 0.625. Then x_4 = 3*0.625 + 1 = 2.875. Then x_5 = 2.875 / 2 = 1.4375. Then x_6 = 1.4375 / 2 = 0.71875. Then x_7 = 3*0.71875 + 1 ≈ 3.15625. Then x_8 ≈ 3.15625 / 2 ≈ 1.578125. Hmm, this seems to be oscillating between numbers below 2 and above 2. Let's see if it's converging to a certain value or cycling between some numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are fixed points here? Fixed points would be values where x_{n+1} = x_n. Let's find them. So, if x_n = x_{n+1}, then either 3x_n + 1 = x_n (if x_n < 2) or x_n / 2 = x_n (if x_n >= 2). \n\nFor the second case, x_n / 2 = x_n implies x_n = 0. But 0 is less than 2, so we can't use that case. So fixed points must come from the first case: 3x + 1 = x. Solving that: 3x + 1 = x ⇒ 2x = -1 ⇒ x = -0.5. But our sequence starts at x_0 ≥ 0, so x_n can't be negative. Therefore, there are no fixed points in the domain x ≥ 0. \n\nHmm, so if there are no fixed points, but we have cycles like 1, 4, 2, then maybe those are the limit points. But in the example starting at 0.5, the sequence seems to oscillate between numbers, sometimes going up, sometimes down.

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: Each peg moves every minute, either left, right, up, or down, but they can't go straight for two consecutive minutes. So, they alternate between horizontal and vertical movements each minute. The question is about the minimal number of pegs needed so that, regardless of their starting positions and movement choices, there must be at least two pegs in the same cell at some point.\n\nThis feels like a problem related to the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the \"pigeonholes\" would be the cells of the board, and the \"pigeons\" would be the pegs. So, if we have more pegs than cells, we can guarantee that at least two are in the same cell. But the problem here is that the pegs are moving, so their positions change over time. However, we need to ensure that regardless of their initial positions and movement sequences, they will eventually collide.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"onge.Tick val van waar de pegvers beginnen en how ze bewomen (de regels in acht Kabatiche)\"—so the starting positions and movement directions can be arbitrary. So, we need a number of pegs such that no matter how you place them and how they move (following the 90-degree turn rule), there will always be a collision. Therefore, the minimal number is the smallest number where even in the best-case scenario (where collisions are avoided as much as possible), you still can't avoid a collision. So, it's like the maximum number of pegs that can be placed without necessarily colliding, and then adding one more would force a collision. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model each peg's movement as a path on the grid. Since each peg alternates between moving horizontally and vertically each minute, their path consists of horizontal and vertical steps alternately. So, each peg's trajectory is a sequence of moves where each move is either horizontal or vertical, and the direction can change every minute.\n\nBut since the movement is constrained to 90-degree turns, each move after the first must be perpendicular to the previous move. So, for example, if a peg moves right, the next move must be either up or down, then the next move must be left or right again. So, the direction alternates between horizontal and vertical each minute.\n\nTherefore, each peg's path can be described as a sequence of horizontal and vertical moves, alternating each minute. The key is that the direction is chosen each time, but the problem states that we need to find the minimal number of pegs such that no matter how they are placed and how they move (following the rules), they must collide.\n\nSo, the question becomes: What is the minimal number N such that any N pegs placed on the grid, each moving according to the 90-degree turn rule, will eventually have two pegs in the same cell at the same time.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps consider the concept of \"collision-free\" paths. If we can determine the maximum number of pegs that can be placed such that their paths never intersect, then the minimal number required to guarantee a collision would be one more than that maximum. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set of such paths, which is the largest set of pegs that can be placed without any two colliding. Then, the answer would be that maximum number plus one.\n\nHowever, calculating the maximum independent set in this context might be challenging. Let's think about how the pegs can move. Each peg alternates between horizontal and vertical movement. So, their movement is similar to a king in chess, but restricted to alternating directions. Alternatively, their path is a self-avoiding walk that alternates directions each step.\n\nBut since the grid is 2023x2023, which is an odd-sized grid. The key might be related to the parity of the coordinates. Let me think. If we color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, alternating black and white squares, then each move changes the color of the square the peg is on. Because moving horizontally or vertically changes the parity of one coordinate, but since the movement alternates between horizontal and vertical, each move changes the parity of the square. Wait, actually, moving in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) changes one coordinate by 1, hence flipping the parity. So, each move flips the color. Therefore, a peg starting on a white square will be on a black square after one move, then white, etc. Similarly for a black starting square.\n\nBut how does this affect collisions? If two pegs start on different colors, they will be on different colors after each move. So, if you have two pegs starting on the same color, after one move they will be on different colors, then same, etc. So, their colors alternate each move. Therefore, two pegs starting on the same color will be on the same color every other move. However, this might not directly contribute to collisions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the movement as a graph where each node represents a cell, and edges represent possible moves. Then, the problem becomes similar to a pebble game on this graph, where each pebble must traverse a path that alternates between horizontal and vertical moves. But I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of possible paths a single peg can take. Since each move is determined by the direction (left, right, up, down) and the position, but given the 90-degree turn rule, the direction can change each time. However, without constraints on the length or positions of the paths, it's difficult to model.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't restrict the number of moves or the paths; the pegs can move indefinitely. So, in theory, a peg could keep moving around the grid indefinitely without repeating a cell, as long as it follows the 90-degree turn rule. However, in a finite grid, such as 2023x2023, a path that doesn't repeat cells would eventually be forced to repeat a cell due to the pigeonhole principle. But the grid is 2023x2023, which is 2023² cells. However, since the movement is constrained to alternating directions, maybe the path can cover more cells?\n\nWait, but even on an infinite grid, a path that alternates directions can potentially visit infinitely many cells. For example, a spiral pattern that keeps turning 90 degrees. However, in a finite grid, such a spiral would eventually have to turn around or repeat cells. But in a 2023x2023 grid, which is quite large but finite, the maximum number of cells a single peg can visit without repeating is limited only by the grid size. So, in theory, a single peg could traverse the entire grid without repeating a cell, depending on the path taken. However, the problem states that \"you can choose any starting position and any movement directions (following the 90-degree turn rule)\", so it's possible that a single peg can avoid collisions indefinitely if it can move in such a way that it never repeats a cell.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of pegs such that no matter how they are placed and how they move (following the rules), there must be a collision. So, if a single peg can traverse the entire grid without repeating, then placing one peg there would never have a collision. But since the grid is finite, such a path must eventually repeat cells, right? Wait, no. If a path on a finite grid can be constructed to never repeat a cell, it's called a Hamiltonian path. However, whether a Hamiltonian path exists on a grid that alternates directions... Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, constructing a Hamiltonian path on a grid where each turn is 90 degrees is more constrained. For example, in a standard grid where you can move in four directions, a Hamiltonian path can be constructed by snaking through the grid. But if you have to alternate between horizontal and vertical moves, then the path is more restricted.\n\nLet me think. If a peg moves right, then up, then left, then up, etc., it might form a kind of spiral. However, in such a spiral, each time it changes direction, it might end up covering a lot of cells. But in a 2023x2023 grid, which is odd-sized, the center cell is unique. A spiral might end up looping around the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to design a path that covers all cells without repeating. However, I'm not sure. Let's consider a simpler grid, say 3x3. Can a single peg, starting at the top-left corner, move right, up, left, up, right, etc., covering all 9 cells without repeating? Let's try:\n\n1. Start at (1,1). Move right to (1,2).\n2. Turn up to (2,2).\n3. Turn left to (2,1).\n4. Turn up to (3,1).\n5. Turn right to (3,2).\n6. Turn up to (3,3).\n7. Turn left to (2,3).\n8. Turn left to (1,3).\n9. Turn down to (1,2). Wait, already visited (1,2). Hmm, so that path repeats.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different path:\n\n1. (1,1) right to (1,2)\n2. Up to (2,2)\n3. Left to (2,1)\n4. Up to (3,1)\n5. Right to (3,2)\n6. Down to (2,2) [already visited]\nHmm, still a repeat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. If the peg moves in a \"U\" shape, moving right, up, left, up, right, etc., but in a 3x3 grid, you can't cover all cells without repeating. So, maybe it's impossible to have a Hamiltonian path on a 3x3 grid with 90-degree turns alternating directions. Therefore, perhaps on larger grids, such as 2023x2023, it's also impossible to have a Hamiltonian path under these constraints. Therefore, a single peg cannot traverse the entire grid without repeating cells. Therefore, if we have multiple pegs, even if each tries to avoid collisions, eventually, due to the number of possible positions and the movement constraints, collisions must occur.\n\nBut how does this help us find the minimal number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem in terms of group theory or modulo arithmetic. Since each move alternates direction, maybe the positions of the pegs can be described using coordinates that have certain periodicities.\n\nWait, let's think about the coordinates. Suppose a peg starts at position (x, y). Each move changes either the x or y coordinate by ±1. Since the direction alternates, the movement in x and y directions are interleaved. For example, if a peg moves right (x increases), then up (y increases), then left (x decreases), then up (y increases), etc. So, over time, the x and y coordinates are affected by these moves. However, since the direction can be chosen freely, as long as it follows the 90-degree turn rule, the net movement in x and y directions can be controlled.\n\nBut how does this relate to collisions? If two pegs can be forced to have the same x and y coordinates at the same time, regardless of their paths, then the minimal number is determined by how many such possible paths exist that don't collide. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each peg's position at time t can be represented as a pair (x(t), y(t)), where each coordinate is a function of time. Since each move alternates between changing x or y, the parity of t might affect the coordinates. For example, if t is even, the x-coordinate is affected by horizontal moves, and y-coordinate by vertical moves, but since the direction can vary, it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Suppose we fix a coordinate system. Let's consider the parity of the coordinates. If a peg moves right or left, it changes the x-coordinate's parity. Similarly, moving up or down changes the y-coordinate's parity. However, since each move alternates between changing x and y, the parity of the coordinates alternates with each move. So, starting at (x0, y0), after one move, the parity of x is flipped if it was changed, and similarly for y. Wait, no. If a peg moves right (x increases by 1), the parity of x is flipped. Then, moving up (y increases by 1), the parity of y is flipped. Then, moving left (x decreases by 1), the parity of x is flipped again. So, each move flips the parity of the coordinate being changed. Therefore, over time, each coordinate's parity alternates with each move.\n\nBut how does this help? If two pegs start with different parities in both coordinates, then after one move, they might have the same parity in one coordinate but different in the other. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire grid as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges connect cells that can be reached by a single move from a given direction. Then, the movement alternates between horizontal and vertical edges. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, let's consider the concept of \"cycle\" in movement. Since the grid is finite, any path must eventually cycle. Therefore, if you have multiple pegs moving on the grid, their cycles could interfere with each other, leading to collisions. But how many cycles are needed to cover all possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node represents a possible state of the grid, and edges represent possible moves. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of nodes (pegs) such that any path through the graph starting from those nodes must eventually collide. However, this seems intractable given the size of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that each peg's movement can be represented as a pair of independent one-dimensional motions: one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction, but with the constraint that the direction changes each minute. Wait, but the direction in x and y can be chosen independently, as long as they follow the 90-degree turn rule. So, for example, a peg could move right, then up, then right, then up, etc., alternating directions each time. But the key is that the direction in x and y can be chosen freely at each step, as long as they turn 90 degrees. Therefore, the movement in x and y can be controlled independently to some extent.\n\nBut since the direction alternates between x and y, perhaps the x and y coordinates can be adjusted independently. For example, if a peg alternates between moving in x and y directions, the total displacement in x after n moves would depend on the number of horizontal moves, and similarly for y. However, since the direction can be", "answer": "2022^{2}+1"}

So we have a natural number n, and there are n islands connected by n-1 bridges such that you can get from any island to any other. On a day, a fire breaks out on one of the islands. Each morning, the fire spreads to all adjacent islands (those connected by a bridge). To control the fire, each night a bridge can be blazed, which prevents the fire from spreading through that bridge the next morning. We need to find the maximum value of X, where X is the minimum number of bridges that need to be blazed to prevent the fire from spreading indefinitely, over all possible island arrangements and initial fire locations.\n\nHmm, so first, the setup is a tree structure because there are n nodes (islands) and n-1 edges (bridges), and it's connected. So any connected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. The fire starts at one node, and then each morning, it spreads to all neighboring nodes that aren't already on fire. To prevent this spread, we can choose to chop down (blaze) certain bridges each night. The goal is to find the maximum possible minimum number of bridges we need to chop down, considering all possible trees and starting nodes.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Zij X het minimale aantal brugs...\". So X is the minimal number of bridges needed to be blazed each night to stop the fire, depending on the tree and the starting island. Then we need to find the maximum X over all possible trees and starting islands.\n\nSo first, for a given tree and a given starting node, we need to determine the minimal number of bridges to chop each night so that the fire can't spread anymore. Then, among all possible trees and starting nodes, find the maximum such X.\n\nLet me think. Let's start with some examples. Let's take n=2. Then there's 1 bridge. If the fire starts on either island, the fire will spread to the other island the next morning unless we chop that bridge. So X=1 here. But since n=2 is the smallest case, maybe the maximum X is 1. But maybe for larger n, it's higher.\n\nTake n=3. Let's consider different trees:\n\n1. A linear chain: A - B - C. Suppose the fire starts at A. The fire spreads to B the next morning, then to C the following morning. So if we don't chop any bridges, the fire will eventually reach C. But since it's a tree, maybe we can chop bridges to stop it. Wait, but if the fire starts at A, the first morning it goes to B. Then next morning, it would go to B's neighbors, which is A and C. But A is already on fire, so it goes to C. So without chopping, the fire would spread to C. So to prevent that, we need to chop the bridge between B and C. So X=1 here. But what if the fire starts at B? Then first morning, it spreads to A and C. Then next morning, if we chop the bridge between A and B, the fire can't go from A to B anymore, but since A is already on fire, it just stays at A, and the fire on C would spread to B? Wait, no. If the bridge between B and C is not chopped, then the fire on C would spread to B the next morning. Wait, let's step through:\n\nIf fire starts at B:\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at B.\n\n- Evening 1: Check bridges. The bridge between B and A is not chopped, so fire spreads to A. The bridge between B and C is not chopped, so fire spreads to C. So now fire is at A, B, C.\n\n- Next morning, all islands are on fire. So no need to chop bridges. Wait, but if the fire starts at B, and first morning spreads to A and C. Then next morning, since A is on fire, but the bridge from A to B is not chopped, the fire on A can spread to B. Similarly, the fire on C can spread to B via the unchopped bridge. So actually, if we don't chop any bridges, the fire will spread to B from both A and C the next morning. Therefore, to prevent the fire from spreading, we need to chop either the bridge between A and B or between B and C. So X=1 here as well.\n\nWait, but in this case, regardless of the starting node, X=1? Hmm. Maybe in the linear chain, X is always 1? Let me check another starting node. If fire starts at C:\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at C.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to B (since B is connected to C and the bridge isn't chopped). Then next morning, fire spreads to A. So again, if we don't chop any bridges, the fire will spread. So to stop it, we need to chop the bridge between B and C. So X=1.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to stop it without chopping? Suppose we chop the bridge between A and B first. Wait, but the fire starts at C. The first morning, fire spreads to B. Then next morning, fire at B can spread to A, but since the bridge between A and B is already chopped, it doesn't spread. Wait, but the fire was at B first morning, then next morning, if the bridge between A and B is not chop, the fire can spread from B to A. But A was not on fire yet. Wait, no. If the bridge between A and B is not chopped, then the fire at B can spread to A. So even if we didn't chop any bridges, the fire would spread from B to A. So to prevent that, we need to chop the bridge between A and B. So X=1 here as well.\n\nSo in the linear chain, for any starting node, X=1. Hmm. That's interesting.\n\nWhat about a different tree structure for n=3, like a star: A connected to B and C. So A is the center. If the fire starts at A, then the first morning, it spreads to B and C. Then next morning, since all islands are on fire, no need to chop. So X=0 here. If the fire starts at B, then first morning, it spreads to A (since A is connected to B). Then next morning, fire at A can spread to C (since A is connected to C). So fire would spread to C. Therefore, to stop the fire from spreading, we need to chop the bridge between A and C. So X=1 here. Similarly, if fire starts at C, same thing. So in the star graph, the maximum X is 1. But in the linear chain, X is always 1. So maybe for n=3, the maximum X is 1.\n\nBut maybe for larger n, the maximum X is higher. Let's take n=4. Let's consider different trees.\n\nFirst, a linear chain: A-B-C-D. If the fire starts at A, it will spread to B, then to C, then to D. To stop it, we need to chop the bridge between C and D. So X=1. Similarly, if the fire starts at D, same thing. If the fire starts at B, then first morning spreads to A and C. Next morning, if we chop the bridge between A and B, the fire can't spread from A to B. But the fire on C can spread to B. So we need to chop the bridge between B and C as well. Wait, no. Let me step through:\n\nIf fire starts at B:\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at B.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to A and C (since bridges B-A and B-C are not chopped). Next morning, morning 2:\n\n- Fire at A and C.\n\n- Check bridges. If we don't chop any bridges, the fire at A can spread to B, and the fire at C can spread to B. So B will get fire the next morning. So to prevent that, we need to chop the bridge between A and B, and/or between C and B. So if we chop both bridges, then fire can't spread. But that would be X=2. But maybe there's a smarter way. Wait, if we chop the bridge between A and B, then fire at A can't spread to B. But the fire at B is already there. Then fire at C can spread to B via the unchopped bridge between C and B. So even if we chop A-B, the fire still spreads from C to B. So to stop that, we need to chop C-B as well. Similarly, if we chop C-B, then fire at C can't spread to B. But fire at A can spread to B. So again, we need to chop both A-B and C-B. Therefore, X=2 here. So in the linear chain for n=4, starting at B, we need to chop 2 bridges. So X=2 here.\n\nAlternatively, if we chop a different bridge. Suppose we chop the bridge between B and C. Then fire at C can't spread to B. But fire at B can spread to A and C. So fire at A spreads to B, and fire at C is already isolated. Wait, no. If we chop B-C, then fire at C can't spread to B. But the fire at B can spread to A and C. So A is on fire, but the bridge to B is not chop, so fire can spread from A to B. But B is on fire, so it stays. So fire at A can spread to B, which is already on fire. So fire at A can't spread further. Fire at C can spread to B (since B-C is not chop), but B is already on fire. So fire at C can't spread further. So if we chop B-C, then fire starting at B would spread to A and C, but then A can spread to B, which is already on fire, so it stops there. C can spread to B, which is already on fire, so it stops there. So actually, chopping B-C would prevent the fire from spreading beyond B and C? Wait, no. If we chop B-C, then fire at C can't spread to B. But fire at B can spread to C. Wait, no. If the bridge between B and C is not chopped, then fire at B can spread to C, but fire at C can't spread to B. But since C is connected to B, which is on fire, but the bridge is not chop, the fire can spread from B to C. So even if we chop B-C, the fire can still spread from B to C. So in that case, X=1? Wait, let's check step by step.\n\nIf we chop B-C:\n\n- Fire starts at B.\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at B.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to A and C (bridges B-A and B-C are not chop). Next morning, morning 2:\n\n- Fire at A and C.\n\n- Check bridges. The bridge between A and B is not chop, so fire can spread from A to B. The bridge between C and B is not chop, so fire can spread from C to B. So fire at A and C both spread to B. But B is already on fire. So fire remains at A, B, C. So it spreads again. Therefore, chopping B-C only prevents fire from spreading from B to C, but fire from A and C can still spread to B. So we need to chop another bridge. For example, chop B-C and also A-B or C-B. Wait, but if we chop both A-B and C-B, then fire can't spread from A or C to B. But the fire starting at B would spread to A and C, which are then isolated. Then, since there's no fire left to spread, the process stops. So in this case, X=2. Because we need to chop two bridges: A-B and C-B. Alternatively, if we chop B-C and also another bridge connected to A or C. Wait, but in the linear chain A-B-C-D, if we chop B-C and A-B, then fire starting at B would spread to A and C. But A is already on fire, and C is connected to B (not chop), so fire can spread from C to B. Wait, no. If bridge C-B is not chop, then fire at C can spread to B. So even if we chop B-C, if we also chop A-B, then fire can't spread from A to B, but fire at A is already there. Fire at C can spread to B via the unchopped bridge C-B. So fire at C spreads to B, which is already on fire. So fire remains at A, B, C. Then next morning, same as before. So we need to chop another bridge. Wait, maybe in this case, it's impossible to stop the fire from spreading unless we chop both A-B and C-B. Therefore, X=2 here.\n\nSo for the linear chain with n=4, starting at B, X=2. Similarly, if the fire starts at C, same thing. If the fire starts at A or D, X=1. So depending on the starting node, X can be 1 or 2. So the maximum X over all starting nodes for this tree is 2. Therefore, for n=4, the maximum X is 2.\n\nIs there a tree where X is higher? Let's think of another tree structure. For example, a \"comb\" structure. Let's take n=4: A connected to B, B connected to C, B connected to D. So like a star with three arms. If the fire starts at A:\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at A.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to B.\n\n- Next morning, fire at B can spread to A, C, D. But A is already on fire. So fire spreads to C and D. So fire at C and D.\n\n- Next morning, fire at C can spread to B (already on fire) and to... but there's no other connections. Similarly, fire at D spreads to B. So fire spreads to B. Then B is on fire. So the fire is spreading through B to C and D. To stop this, we need to chop the bridge between B and C, and between B and D. So X=2 here. If we chop those two bridges, then fire can't spread from C or D to B. But fire is already at B. So it stops. Alternatively, if we chop the bridge between A and B first. Wait, if we chop A-B first:\n\n- Fire starts at A.\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at A.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to B (since A-B is not chop). Next morning, morning 2:\n\n- Fire at B.\n\n- Check bridges. If we don't chop, fire at B can spread to A (already on fire), C, and D. So fire spreads to C and D.\n\n- Next morning, fire at C and D can spread to B. So again, X=2.\n\nAlternatively, if we chop the bridge between B and C first:\n\n- Fire starts at A.\n\n- Morning 1: Fire at A.\n\n- Evening 1: Fire spreads to B (A B and D? Wait, in the comb structure, B is connected to", "answer": "\\left \\lfloor \\sqrt{n-1} \\right \\rfloor"}

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some number theory concepts. The function α(n) is the average of the positive divisors of n. I know that the sum of the divisors of n is given by σ(n), and the number of divisors is d(n). So, α(n) should be σ(n)/d(n). That makes sense because the average is the sum divided by the number of elements.\n\nNow, β(n) is the average of all positive integers k ≤ n that are coprime to n. The number of such integers is given by Euler's totient function φ(n). So, the sum of these numbers divided by φ(n) would be β(n). Wait, but how do I find the sum of numbers coprime to n and less than or equal to n?\n\nI remember that the sum of numbers coprime to n and less than or equal to n can be calculated using the formula (n * φ(n))/2. Let me check if that's correct. For example, take n=5. The numbers coprime to 5 are 1,2,3,4. Their sum is 10, which is (5*4)/2=10. Yep, that works. Another example: n=6. Numbers coprime to 6 are 1,5. Their sum is 6, which is (6*2)/2=6. That also works. So the formula seems valid. Therefore, the sum is (n * φ(n))/2, so β(n) = [(n * φ(n))/2]/φ(n) = n/2. Wait, that's interesting. So β(n) is just n/2 regardless of φ(n)? That can't be right. Wait, let me verify with n=6. φ(6)=2, numbers are 1 and 5. Their average is (1+5)/2=3, which is 6/2=3. For n=5, average is (1+2+3+4)/4=10/4=2.5, which is 5/2=2.5. Hmm, so indeed, β(n) = n/2. That simplifies things a lot! So β(n) is always n/2. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all n where α(n) = n/2. Because α(n) is the average of the divisors, which is σ(n)/d(n), and β(n) is n/2. So we need σ(n)/d(n) = n/2. Therefore, the equation to solve is σ(n)/d(n) = n/2, which can be rewritten as 2σ(n) = n * d(n).\n\nSo, the problem now is to find all positive integers n such that 2σ(n) = n * d(n). Let's note that σ(n) is the sum of divisors, d(n) is the number of divisors.\n\nI need to find all n where this equality holds. Let's start by checking small values of n and see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nn=1:\nDivisors: {1}. σ(1)=1, d(1)=1. So 2σ(1)=2, n*d(n)=1*1=1. Not equal.

Let's check n=24. Wait, 6 is the only one so far. Let me check n=30.\n\nn=30:\nDivisors: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. σ=72, d=8. 2σ=144, n*d=30*8=240. Not equal.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about the equation 2σ(n) = n * d(n). Let's rearrange this equation: σ(n) = (n * d(n))/2.\n\nSo, the sum of divisors of n must equal half of n multiplied by the number of divisors of n.\n\nThis seems like a restrictive condition. Let's see for n=6:\n\nσ(6)=1+2+3+6=12. (6 * 4)/2=24/2=12. So yes, it works.\n\nSo, for n=6, σ(n)=12 and d(n)=4. So 12= (6*4)/2=12. So that works.\n\nWhat about other numbers? Let's check n=24 again. σ(n)=60, d(n)=8. (24*8)/2=96. 60≠96. Not equal.\n\nWait, perhaps n=6 is the only solution. But let's check n=24/2=12, but n=12 didn't work. Let me check n=24 again. Wait, σ(n)=60, d(n)=8. 60 vs (24*8)/2=96. Not equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe n=24 is not a solution. Let's check n=28. σ(n)=56, d(n)=6. (28*6)/2=84. 56≠84.\n\nWait, perhaps n=6 is the only solution.

Let me check n=24/3=8. n=8: σ=15, d=4. 2σ=30, n*d=32. Not equal.\n\nWait, maybe there are no other solutions. Let me check n=6.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of n. For 2σ(n) = n * d(n), so σ(n) = (n * d(n))/2. Let's think about possible forms of n.\n\nSuppose n is a prime number. Let's take n=p, prime. Then σ(n)=1+p, d(n)=2. So 2σ(n)=2(1+p). n*d(n)=p*2. So 2σ(n)=2(1+p)=2p + 2. n*d(n)=2p. So 2σ(n)=2p + 2 vs 2p. These are equal only if 2=0, which is impossible. Therefore, primes cannot be solutions.\n\nSimilarly, for n=p², where p is prime. σ(n)=1 + p + p². d(n)=3. So 2σ(n)=2(1 + p + p²). n*d(n)=p²*3. So 2σ(n)=2 + 2p + 2p². Setting equal to 3p²: 2 + 2p + 2p² = 3p² => 2 + 2p = p² => p² - 2p -2=0. Solving quadratic: p=(2 ± sqrt(4 +8))/2=(2 ± sqrt(12))/2=(2 ± 2*sqrt(3))/2=1 ± sqrt(3). Not integer. So no solution for prime squares.\n\nWhat about n=p*q, product of two distinct primes. Let n=pq. Then σ(n)=(1+p)(1+q). d(n)=4. So 2σ(n)=2(1+p)(1+q). n*d(n)=pq*4=4pq. So equation: 2(1+p)(1+q)=4pq => (1+p)(1+q)=2pq. Let's expand left side: 1 + p + q + pq = 2pq => 1 + p + q = pq. Rearranged: pq - p - q =1. Adding 1 to both sides: pq - p - q +1=2 => (p-1)(q-1)=2. So (p-1)(q-1)=2. Since p and q are primes greater than or equal to 2, p-1 and q-1 are at least 1. The factors of 2 are 1*2 or 2*1. Therefore, possible solutions:\n\nCase 1: p-1=1 and q-1=2 => p=2, q=3.\n\nCase 2: p-1=2 and q-1=1 => p=3, q=2.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are n=2*3=6. Which is the solution we found earlier. So n=6 is a product of two distinct primes where (p-1)(q-1)=2. So this is the only solution in the case of semiprimes.\n\nWhat about n=pqr, product of three distinct primes? Let's check if such n can satisfy the equation. Let n=pqr, σ(n)=(1+p)(1+q)(1+r). d(n)=8. So 2σ(n)=2(1+p)(1+q)(1+r). n*d(n)=pqr*8. So equation: 2(1+p)(1+q)(1+r)=8pqr => (1+p)(1+q)(1+r)=4pqr. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nAssume p < q < r primes. Let's take the smallest primes: p=2, q=3, r=5. Then left side: (3)(4)(6)=72. Right side: 4*2*3*5=120. 72≠120.

I need to find all prime pairs (p, q) such that there exist positive integers m and n where (p + q)^m = (p - q)^n. Hmm, primes, exponents... Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, since p and q are primes, they are positive integers greater than or equal to 2. Also, primes except for 2 are odd, so if both p and q are odd primes, then p + q and p - q would both be even numbers. But if one of them is 2, let's say p = 2, then p + q = 2 + q and p - q = 2 - q. Since q is a prime, if q is 2, then p - q would be 0, which is not positive. So q must be greater than 2 in that case. Wait, but q is a prime, so if p = 2, then q must be an odd prime greater than 2. Then p - q would be 2 - q, which is negative. But the problem states that m and n are positive integers, so (p - q)^n must be a positive number. Therefore, p - q must be positive. Therefore, p must be greater than q. So p > q. That makes sense. So p and q are primes with p > q, and we need (p + q)^m = (p - q)^n for some m, n in positive integers.\n\nSo first, p > q, both primes. Let's note that p - q must be a positive integer, and since both p and q are primes, p - q must also be a positive integer. So we need two primes p and q such that their sum and difference raised to some exponents are equal.\n\nLet me think. Since p and q are primes, and p > q, p - q is at least 2 (since primes are at least 2, except 2 itself). Let's try small primes first. Let's list some small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.\n\nLet me start with the smallest primes. Let's take q = 2. Then p must be a prime greater than 2. Let's try p = 3. Then p + q = 5, p - q = 1. So equation becomes 5^m = 1^n. But 1^n is 1, and 5^m is 5, 25, etc. So no solution here.\n\nNext, p = 5. Then p + q = 7, p - q = 3. So 7^m = 3^n. We need integers m, n such that 7^m = 3^n. But 7 and 3 are primes, so their powers can't be equal unless m = n = 0, but m and n must be positive. So no solution here.\n\nNext, p = 7, q = 2. Then p + q = 9, p - q = 5. So 9^m = 5^n. Again, 9 and 5 are primes. 9 is 3², 5 is prime. So 3^(2m) = 5^n. Since 3 and 5 are primes, exponents must be zero, which they aren't. So no solution.\n\nWait, maybe q = 2 isn't the right starting point. Let's try q = 3. Then p must be a prime greater than 3. Let's take p = 5. Then p + q = 8, p - q = 2. So equation is 8^m = 2^n. 8 is 2³, so (2³)^m = 2^(3m) = 2^n. Therefore, 3m = n. So as long as n is a multiple of 3, this equation holds. For example, m = 1, n = 3: 8^1 = 2^3 → 8 = 8. That works. So (p, q) = (5, 3) is a solution with m=1, n=3.\n\nCool, that's one solution. Let's check if there are others. Let's see p = 7, q = 3. Then p + q = 10, p - q = 4. So 10^m = 4^n. 10 is 2*5, 4 is 2². So 2^m * 5^m = 2^(2n). Therefore, 5^m = 2^(2n - m). Since 5 and 2 are primes, the only way this can happen is if m = 0 and 2n - m = 0, but m must be positive. So no solution here.\n\nNext, p = 5, q = 2: already checked, no solution. p = 7, q = 5. Then p + q = 12, p - q = 2. So 12^m = 2^n. 12 is 2²*3, so (2²*3)^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m = 2^n. Therefore, 3^m = 2^(n - 2m). Again, primes 3 and 2, so only possible if m = 0 and n - 2m = 0, but m must be positive. So no solution.\n\nWhat about p = 11, q = 3. Then p + q = 14, p - q = 8. So 14^m = 8^n. 14 is 2*7, 8 is 2³. So (2*7)^m = 2^(3n). Therefore, 7^m = 2^(3n - m). Again, primes 7 and 2, so only possible if m = 0 and 3n - m = 0, but m must be positive. No solution.\n\nHmm. Let's see another case. Let's try q = 5. Then p must be a prime greater than 5. Let's take p = 7. Then p + q = 12, p - q = 2. 12^m = 2^n. As before, 12 is 2²*3, so 2^(2m)*3^m = 2^n. Therefore, 3^m = 2^(n - 2m). Again, only possible if m = 0, which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, p = 11, q = 7. Then p + q = 18, p - q = 4. So 18^m = 4^n. 18 is 2*3², 4 is 2². So (2*3²)^m = 2^(2n). So 2^m*3^(2m) = 2^(2n). Therefore, 3^(2m) = 2^(2n - m). Again, primes 3 and 2, so only possible if both exponents are zero, which they aren't. So no solution.\n\nWait, so far, the only solution we found was (5, 3). Let's check another possible pair. How about p = 3 and q = 2. Then p + q = 5, p - q = 1. So 5^m = 1^n. 1^n is 1, so 5^m = 1. Only possible if m = 0, which is invalid. So no.\n\nAnother case: p = 7, q = 5. Then p + q = 12, p - q = 2. 12^m = 2^n. As before, no solution.\n\nWait, let's think algebraically. Suppose (p + q)^m = (p - q)^n. Since p and q are primes, p > q. Let's denote a = p + q and b = p - q. Then a and b are positive integers with a > b, and a * b = (p + q)(p - q) = p² - q². But not sure if that helps.\n\nBut since a^m = b^n, and a and b are positive integers, then a and b must be powers of the same prime? Wait, not necessarily. For example, 8^2 = 4^3 (64 = 64), but 8 and 4 are both powers of 2. Wait, in the case where (p, q) = (5, 3), we had a = 8 and b = 2, which are also powers of 2. So 8^1 = 2^3. So in that case, a is 8 = 2^3, and b is 2 = 2^1. Then (2^3)^1 = (2^1)^3. So exponents m=1 and n=3. So maybe in general, if a and b are powers of the same prime, then we can have such equations.\n\nSo perhaps we need that p + q and p - q are both powers of the same prime. Let's denote that p + q = k^m and p - q = k^n for some prime k. But since p + q and p - q are both positive integers, and p + q > p - q, then k^m > k^n, so m > n. But k is a prime. Also, since p and q are primes, and p > q, let's see if p + q and p - q can both be powers of the same prime.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that p + q = s^m and p - q = s^n where s is a prime. Then adding these two equations: 2p = s^m + s^n. Subtracting: 2q = s^m - s^n. Since s is a prime, s^m and s^n are both powers of s. Let's factor s^n: s^n(s^{m - n} - 1) = 2q. Since q is a prime, the right-hand side is 2 times a prime. So s^n must divide 2q. Since s is a prime, s must divide 2q. Therefore, s is either 2 or q. Let's consider cases.\n\nCase 1: s = 2. Then 2p = 2^m + 2^n. Let's write this as 2p = 2^n(2^{m - n} + 1). Since p is prime, 2p is 2 times a prime. Therefore, 2^n(2^{m - n} + 1) must equal 2 times a prime. So 2^n must be a divisor of 2, which implies n = 1. Then, 2p = 2*(2^{m - 1} + 1). Therefore, p = 2^{m - 1} + 1. Also, from the subtracted equation: 2q = 2^m - 2^n = 2^n(2^{m - n} - 1). Since s = 2, and q is prime, then 2q = 2^n(2^{m - n} - 1). So 2q = 2^n(2^{m - n} - 1). Therefore, q = 2^{n - 1}(2^{m - n} - 1). Since q is a prime, the right-hand side must be a prime. Let's analyze this.\n\nGiven that q is prime, and n is a positive integer. Let's note that n must be at least 1. If n = 1, then q = 2^{0}(2^{m - 1} - 1) = 1*(2^{m - 1} - 1). Therefore, q = 2^{m - 1} - 1. Since q is prime, 2^{m - 1} - 1 must be prime. So 2^{m - 1} is a Mersenne prime plus 1. For example, if m - 1 = 1, then 2^1 - 1 = 1, which is not prime. If m - 1 = 2, then 2^2 - 1 = 3, which is prime. So m - 1 = 2 → m = 3. Then q = 3. Then p = 2^{m - 1} + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 5. So p = 5, q = 3. That's the solution we found earlier. Let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIf n = 1, and q = 2^{m - 1} - 1. Let's see for m - 1 = 3, so m = 4. Then q = 2^3 - 1 = 7. Then p = 2^{4 - 1} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. But 9 is not a prime. So invalid. For m - 1 = 4, m = 5. q = 16 - 1 = 15, not prime. So no. m - 1 = 5, m = 6. q = 32 -1 = 31, which is prime. Then p = 2^{6 -1} +1 = 32 +1 = 33, which is not prime. So invalid. So only when m -1 = 2, which gives m = 3, gives a prime p = 5 and q = 3. So that's the only solution in this case.\n\nIf n > 1, then n ≥ 2. Then q = 2^{n -1}(2^{m - n} - 1). Since q is prime, the right-hand side must be a prime. The term 2^{n -1} is a power of 2, and (2^{m - n} - 1) is an odd number. So the product is 2^{n -1} times an odd prime. But since q is prime, this product can only be prime if one of the factors is 1. So either 2^{n -1} = 1 or (2^{m - n} - 1) = 1.\n\nIf 2^{n -1} = 1, then n -1 = 0 → n = 1. But we assumed n ≥ 2, so this is invalid.\n\nIf (2^{m - n} - 1) = 1, then 2^{m - n} = 2 → m - n = 1. So m = n + 1. Then q = 2^{n -1} * 1 = 2^{n -1}. Since q is prime, 2^{n -1} must be prime. Therefore, n -1 must be 1, so n = 2. Then q = 2", "answer": "2"}

So, we have a sequence defined by a₁ = 850 and the recursive formula a_{n+1} = a_n² / (a_n - 1). We need to find all values of n for which the floor of a_n is 2024, meaning ⌊a_n⌋ = 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequence behaves. The recursive formula looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I can find a pattern or simplify it, that would help. Let's start by computing the first few terms manually to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with a₁ = 850. Then, a₂ = (850)² / (850 - 1) = 722500 / 849. Let me compute that. 722500 divided by 849. Let's approximate this. 849 is approximately 850, so 722500 / 850 = 850. But since 849 is slightly less than 850, the result will be slightly more than 850. Let me calculate it exactly:\n\n722500 ÷ 849. Let's see, 849 * 850 = 849*800 + 849*50 = 679200 + 42450 = 721,650. Then, 721,650 + 849 = 722,500 - 1,650 + 849? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 849*850 = 721,650. So 722,500 - 721,650 = 850. So 722,500 = 849*850 + 850 = 850*(849 + 1) = 850*850. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 849*850 = (800 + 49)*(800 + 50). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Wait, 849 is 850 -1, so 849*850 = (850 -1)*850 = 850² -850. So 850² is 722,500. Then 850² -850 = 722,500 -850 = 721,650. Therefore, 722,500 divided by 849 is 850² / (850 -1) = a₂. So, 722,500 /849 = (850²)/(850 -1) = a₂. \n\nBut 850² = 722,500, so dividing that by 849 gives us a₂. Let me compute 722,500 divided by 849. Let's see, 849*850 = 721,650. So 722,500 - 721,650 = 850. Therefore, 722,500 = 849*850 +850 = 850*(849 +1) = 850*850. Wait, so 722,500 /849 = (850*850)/(850 -1). Hmm, maybe this is a telescoping sequence? Wait, perhaps if I write a_{n+1} = a_n² / (a_n -1). Let's try to manipulate this equation.\n\nSuppose we let x = a_n. Then a_{n+1} = x² / (x -1). Let's see if we can express this in terms of reciprocals. Let me take reciprocal of both sides: 1/a_{n+1} = (x -1)/x² = (1/x) - (1/x²). Hmm, maybe not immediately helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange:\n\na_{n+1} = x² / (x -1). Let's write this as:\n\na_{n+1} = x + 1 + 1/(x -1). Wait, let's check:\n\nx² / (x -1) = (x² -1 +1)/(x -1) = (x -1)(x +1) +1 / (x -1) = x +1 + 1/(x -1). Yes, that's correct. So:\n\na_{n+1} = x +1 + 1/(x -1). Therefore, the recursion can be written as:\n\na_{n+1} = a_n + 1 + 1/(a_n -1). Hmm, interesting. So each term is the previous term plus 1 plus 1 over (previous term minus 1). Since a₁ is 850, which is a large number, the term 1/(a_n -1) will be very small. So maybe the sequence increases by approximately 1 each time, but with a tiny fraction added. So the sequence is increasing, but each term is just a bit more than the previous term. Therefore, starting from 850, each subsequent term is around 851, then 852, etc. But we need to find when the floor of a_n is 2024. So when does a_n cross from below 2024 to 2024 or above? Wait, but if the sequence is increasing by roughly 1 each time, then maybe the floor would be 2024 for some n where a_n is between 2024 and 2025. But we need to verify how much exactly the sequence increases each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence grows faster? Let's check. Let's compute a₂ first:\n\na₂ = 850 +1 + 1/(850 -1) ≈ 851 + 1/849 ≈ 851.001176. So a₂ ≈851.001176. Then a₃ = a₂ +1 +1/(a₂ -1) ≈851.001176 +1 +1/(851.001176 -1) ≈852.001176 +1/(850.001176). The term 1/(850.001176) is approximately 1/850 ≈0.001176. So a₃ ≈852.001176 +0.001176≈852.002352. Then a₄ ≈853.002352 +1/(852.002352 -1)=853.002352 +1/851.002352≈853.002352 +0.001175≈853.003527. It seems like each term is increasing by approximately 1 + 1/(current term -1). Since current term is increasing, the term 1/(current term -1) is decreasing. So the increments are getting smaller. Therefore, the sequence is increasing, but the increments are approaching 1. So maybe the sequence is approaching a linear growth, but with slightly more each time.\n\nWait, if the increment is 1 + 1/(a_n -1), and as a_n becomes large, 1/(a_n -1) becomes negligible, so the increment approaches 1. Therefore, the sequence a_n is roughly n + C, where C is some constant. But starting from a₁=850, the sequence would be approximately 850 + (n-1)*1, so a_n ≈850 + (n-1). Therefore, when does a_n ≈2024? That would be when n-1 ≈2024 -850=1174, so n≈1175. But since the increments are slightly more than 1 each time, maybe the actual n where floor(a_n)=2024 is a bit less than 1175? Wait, but how much exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this recursion as a differential equation. If we think of a_n as a function a(n), then the difference a(n+1) - a(n) ≈ da/dn ≈1 +1/(a -1). So da/dn ≈1 +1/(a -1). Then, we can write this as da/(1 +1/(a -1)) ≈ dn. Let's see:\n\n1 +1/(a -1) = (a -1 +1)/(a -1) = a / (a -1). Therefore, da/(a/(a -1)) ≈ dn ⇒ (a -1)/a da ≈ dn ⇒ (1 -1/a) da ≈ dn. Then, integrating both sides:\n\n∫(1 -1/a) da ≈ ∫ dn ⇒ a - ln|a| + C ≈ n.\n\nSo, approximately, a - ln a ≈ n + C. Then, solving for a, we get a ≈n + ln a + C. But this is a rough approximation. However, since a is approximately n + ln a + C, and for large n, ln a is much smaller than n, so a ≈n + C. Therefore, the leading term is n, so the floor of a_n is roughly n + floor(C). But since we don't know C, maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to manipulate the recursion:\n\na_{n+1} = a_n² / (a_n -1). Let's try to invert both sides:\n\n1/a_{n+1} = (a_n -1)/a_n² = 1/a_n - 1/a_n². Hmm, maybe this telescopes. Let me write:\n\n1/a_{n+1} = 1/a_n - 1/a_n². Then, rearranged:\n\n1/a_n - 1/a_{n+1} = 1/a_n². Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's consider the difference between 1/(a_n -1) and 1/a_n. Let's compute:\n\n1/(a_n -1) - 1/a_n = [a_n - (a_n -1)] / [a_n(a_n -1)] = 1 / [a_n(a_n -1)]. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider the substitution b_n = 1/(a_n -1). Then:\n\nb_n = 1/(a_n -1). Then, a_n =1 +1/b_n. Let's substitute into the recursion:\n\na_{n+1} = (1 +1/b_n)² / ( (1 +1/b_n) -1 ) = (1 + 2/b_n +1/b_n²) / (1/b_n) = b_n(1 + 2/b_n +1/b_n²) = b_n +2 +1/b_n.\n\nTherefore, a_{n+1} = b_n +2 +1/b_n. But since a_{n+1} =1 +1/b_{n+1}, we have:\n\n1 +1/b_{n+1} = b_n +2 +1/b_n.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/b_{n+1} = b_n +2 +1/b_n -1 = b_n +1 +1/b_n.\n\nThus,\n\nb_{n+1} =1/(b_n +1 +1/b_n).\n\nHmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look back at the original recursion:\n\na_{n+1} = a_n² / (a_n -1). Let's write this as:\n\na_{n+1} -1 = (a_n² - (a_n -1)) / (a_n -1) = (a_n² -a_n +1)/(a_n -1). Let's compute that numerator:\n\na_n² -a_n +1 = (a_n -1)(a_n) +1. Therefore,\n\na_{n+1} -1 = [ (a_n -1)a_n +1 ] / (a_n -1 ) = a_n + 1/(a_n -1).\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\na_{n+1} -1 = a_n +1/(a_n -1).\n\nBut this is the same as the earlier expression. So, perhaps we can define c_n = a_n -1, then the recursion becomes:\n\nc_{n+1} = (c_n +1) + 1/(c_n). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a_{n+1} = a_n +1 +1/(a_n -1), maybe we can approximate the sequence as a(n) ≈n + c, where c is some constant. But since the increment is 1 +1/(a_n -1), which is slightly more than 1, the actual growth is faster than linear. So maybe a(n) is approximately n + ln n + C? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the difference between a_n and n is converging to a constant? Let's check for some terms.\n\nWe have a₁=850, a₂≈851.001176, a₃≈852.002352, a₄≈853.003527, etc. The increments are roughly 1.001, 1.001, 1.001, etc. So, for the first few terms, the increment is about 1.001, which is 1/(850 -1)≈0.001176. Wait, but each time, the increment is 1 +1/(a_n -1). When a_n is 850, the increment is 1 +1/849≈1.001176. Then, when a_n is 851, the increment is 1 +1/850≈1.001176. So, actually, as a_n increases, the increment approaches 1. So the increments are slightly above 1, but decreasing towards 1. Therefore, the sequence is increasing, but the rate of increase is approaching 1. Therefore, the total increase from", "answer": "1175"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling that a number with at most 6 positive divisors must be either a prime power (like p^k where k is a positive integer) or a product of two distinct primes, or maybe a cube of a prime, but wait, actually, the number of divisors is determined by the exponents in its prime factorization. For example, if a number factors as 2^a * 3^b * 5^c..., then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... So, if a number has at most 6 divisors, then the possible factorizations are:\n\n1. A prime (2 divisors)\n2. A prime squared (3 divisors)\n3. A prime cubed (4 divisors)\n4. A product of two distinct primes (4 divisors)\n5. A product of a prime square and another prime (6 divisors)\n6. A prime to the fourth power (5 divisors) – wait, no, 5 divisors would be for p^4, since (4+1)=5. Similarly, 6 divisors could be p^5 (but 5+1=6) or p^2 * q where p and q are distinct primes. So, actually, numbers with 1 divisor are 1, but since we are talking about natural numbers, we need to consider numbers greater than 1. So the possible forms are:\n\n- Prime (2 divisors)\n- Prime squared (3 divisors)\n- Prime cubed (4 divisors)\n- Product of two distinct primes (4 divisors)\n- Prime to the fourth power (5 divisors)\n- Product of a prime squared and another prime (6 divisors)\n\nSo, the number N must be of one of these forms. Our job is to find primes p where N is one of these. Since p is a prime, let's try small primes first and see if we can find a pattern or if only small primes satisfy the condition.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions 9049 is a prime, maybe that's relevant. Let me check if 9049 is involved in any of the computations.\n\nFirst, let's compute N for p=2, p=3, p=5, etc., and factorize them to check the number of divisors.\n\nStarting with p=2:\n\nN = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 - 98\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n9^2 = 81\n\nSum: 9 + 16 + 25 + 81 = 131\n\nSubtract 98: 131 - 98 = 33\n\n33 factors into 3 * 11, which are both primes. So number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1) = 4. Since 4 ≤ 6, p=2 is a candidate.\n\nNext, p=3:\n\nN = 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 - 98\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n4^3 = 64\n\n5^3 = 125\n\n9^3 = 729\n\nSum: 27 + 64 + 125 + 729 = 945\n\nSubtract 98: 945 - 98 = 847\n\nNow factorize 847. Let's check divisibility:\n\n847 ÷ 7 = 121, since 7*121=847. Wait, 7*120=840, so 847=7*121. Then 121 is 11^2. So 847 = 7 * 11^2. Therefore, the number of divisors is (1+1)(2+1) = 2*3=6. Since 6 ≤6, p=3 is also a candidate.\n\nNext, p=5:\n\nN = 3^5 + 4^5 + 5^5 + 9^5 - 98\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n4^5 = 1024\n\n5^5 = 3125\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\nSum: 243 + 1024 + 3125 + 59049 = let's compute step by step:\n\n243 + 1024 = 1267\n\n1267 + 3125 = 4392\n\n4392 + 59049 = 63441\n\nSubtract 98: 63441 - 98 = 63343\n\nNow, factorize 63343. Hmm, this might be tricky. Let's check if it's a prime. Since the problem mentions 9049 is a prime, maybe 63343 is related? Let me check.\n\nWait, 9049 is a prime, but 63343 divided by 9049? Let's see: 9049*7=63343? 9049*7: 9000*7=63000, 49*7=343, so 63000+343=63343. Yes! So 63343 = 7 * 9049. And since 9049 is a prime (given), then 63343 factors into 7 * 9049. Therefore, the number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is ≤6. So p=5 is also a candidate.\n\nNext, p=7:\n\nCompute N = 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 9^7 - 98\n\nFirst compute each term:\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n4^7 = 16384\n\n5^7 = 78125\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\nSum: 2187 + 16384 = 18571\n\n18571 + 78125 = 96696\n\n96696 + 4782969 = 4879665\n\nSubtract 98: 4879665 - 98 = 4879567\n\nNow, factorize 4879567. This seems big. Let me check if it's divisible by small primes.\n\nFirst, check if it's even: 4879567 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n\nSum of digits: 4+8+7+9+5+6+7 = 46, which is not divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3.\n\nEnds with 7, so not divisible by 5. Let's check 7: 4879567 ÷7. Let's compute 7*697080 = 4879560, so 4879567 -4879560=7, so 7*697081=4879567. Wait, 7*697081=4879567. So 697081. Is 697081 divisible by 7? Let's check 697081 ÷7: 7*99583=697,081? 7*90000=630000, 7*9583=67,081. So 630000 +67081=697,081. So 7*99583=697,081. Therefore, 4879567=7*7*99583=49*99583. Now check if 99583 is prime. Let's try dividing by small primes. 99583 ÷11: 11*9053=99583? 11*9000=99000, 11*53=583, so 99000+583=99583. Yes! So 99583=11*9053. Therefore, 4879567=7^2 *11*9053. Now check 9053. Let's see if 9053 is prime. Check divisibility by 13: 13*700=9100, so 13*696=9048, 9053-9048=5. Not divisible by 13. 17: 17*532=9044, 9053-9044=9, not divisible. 19: 19*476=9044, same as above. 23: 23*393=9039, 9053-9039=14, not divisible. 29: 29*312=9072, which is more. So maybe 9053 is prime? Let me check. 9053 divided by 3: 9+0+5+3=17, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 3, no. 7: 7*1293=9051, 9053-9051=2, not divisible. 11: 11*823=9053? 11*800=8800, 11*23=253, so 8800+253=9053. Yes! So 9053=11*823. Wait, 11*823=9053. So 823: check if prime. Let's check divisibility. 823 ÷2=411.5, no. 823 ÷3: 8+2+3=13, not divisible. 5: ends with 3. 7: 7*117=819, 823-819=4, not divisible. 11: 11*74=814, 823-814=9, not divisible. 13: 13*63=819, same as above. 17: 17*48=816, 823-816=7, not divisible. 19: 19*43=817, 823-817=6, not divisible. 23: 23*35=805, 823-805=18, not divisible. 29: 29*28=812, 823-812=11, not divisible. 31: 31*26=806, 823-806=17, not divisible. So 823 is prime. Therefore, 9053=11*823. Therefore, 4879567=7^2 *11^2 *823. So the number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18, which is greater than 6. Therefore, p=7 is not a candidate.\n\nSo p=7 is out. Let's check p=7 gives N with 18 divisors, which is too many. So p=7 is invalid.\n\nNext, p=11. Wait, primes go 2,3,5,7,11,13,... Maybe check p=11, but given that p=7 already gives a huge number, perhaps primes larger than 5 might result in even larger N, which would have more divisors. Let's check p=11 just to confirm.\n\nCompute N for p=11:\n\n3^11 +4^11 +5^11 +9^11 -98\n\nThis is going to be enormous. Let me see if there's a smarter way. Alternatively, maybe the pattern stops at p=5. Let's check p=5 gives N=63343=7*9049, and since 9049 is prime, that's two primes, so 4 divisors. So that's okay. But p=7 gives 18 divisors, which is too many.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a prime p where N is a prime? Let's check p=2: N=33=3*11, which is composite. p=3: N=847=7*11^2, composite. p=5: N=7*9049, composite. So maybe N is always composite for primes p≥2, except maybe for some larger primes? But since p=7 already gives N with 18 divisors, which is way over 6, it's unlikely. Let's check p=11 just to be thorough.\n\nBut calculating 3^11, 4^11, 5^11, 9^11 is tedious. Let me compute each term:\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\n4^11 = 4194304\n\n5^11 = 48828125\n\n9^11 = 31381059609\n\nSum them up:\n\n177147 + 4194304 = 4371451\n\n4371451 + 48828125 = 53,199,576\n\n5", "answer": "2, 3, 5"}

Each card has a real number between 0 and 1. The total sum of all the cards is at most 1000. Each student needs to be able to distribute these cards into 1200 boxes (since a dozen is 12, 100 dozen is 1200) such that the sum in each box is at most c. We need the minimal such c that works for any possible set of numbers on the cards, given the total sum is ≤1000.\n\nSo the question is about scheduling or bin packing, but with real numbers between 0 and 1. The classic bin packing problem is similar, but usually, you have items with integer sizes and bins of integer capacity. Here, the items are real numbers, and the bins (boxes) can have any real numbers as long as their sum is ≤ c. The goal is to find the minimal c such that, regardless of the items (as long as their total sum is ≤1000), we can pack them into 1200 bins with each bin's sum ≤c.\n\nI remember there's a theorem called the \"Karmarkar-Karp\" algorithm for bin packing, but that's for integers. Maybe for real numbers, there's a different approach. Also, since all the numbers are between 0 and 1, maybe we can use some averaging argument.\n\nIf all the numbers were 1, then each box can hold at most c, and since each card is 1, the number of cards per box would be at most floor(c). But since we have 1200 boxes, the total number of cards is at most 1200 * floor(c). But the total sum is ≤1000, so the number of cards is at least 1000 (since each card is at least 0, but the sum is at most 1000). Wait, actually, if the numbers are between 0 and 1, the number of cards is at least 1000 (if all numbers are 1) and up to 1000 / 0, which is infinity. Wait, no. If all numbers are 1, there are 1000 cards. If some numbers are smaller, there could be more cards. For example, if all numbers are 0.5, there would be 2000 cards. So the number of cards can vary between 1000 and infinity, depending on the numbers. But the problem states that the total sum is at most 1000, so the number of cards is at least 1000 (if all are 1) and up to 1000 / 0 (which is impossible, but since numbers are in [0,1], the number of cards is at most 1000 / 0.000...1, which is not finite. Wait, no, the problem says \"eindig number of kaartjes\", so the number of cards is finite but not specified. However, each card is in [0,1], so the number of cards can be arbitrarily large as long as their total sum is ≤1000.\n\nBut how does that affect the problem? Because in the bin packing problem, the number of items can be large, but here, we have a fixed number of boxes (1200), and we need to bound the sum in each box. So maybe the key is to use the pigeonhole principle or some averaging argument.\n\nIf the total sum is S ≤1000, then the average sum per box would be S / 1200. So if we could set c to be equal to this average, then it would work. But since the numbers can be arranged in any way, maybe the worst case is when the numbers are arranged in a way that makes it difficult to pack them without exceeding c. So perhaps c has to be at least the ceiling of the average, but since we can adjust the packing, maybe c can be lower?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's saying that \"Elke Scholier ... can divide the cards into 100 dozen boxes ... such that the sum of the cards in each box is at most c.\" So the question is, what is the minimal c such that no matter what the numbers on the cards are (as long as their total is ≤1000), they can always be packed into 1200 boxes with each box sum ≤c.\n\nSo, to find the minimal c, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, where the numbers are arranged in such a way that makes it as hard as possible to pack them into 1200 boxes without exceeding c. Therefore, we need to find the minimal c where even in the worst case, the packing is possible.\n\nI recall that in bin packing, there's a result called the \"First Fit\" algorithm's performance. First Fit has a worst-case performance ratio of 11/9 OPT + 1. But this is for integer sizes. For real numbers, the analysis is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a theorem by Martina and others. Wait, perhaps this is related to scheduling on parallel machines. If we think of each box as a machine that can process jobs with total processing time up to c, and we want to schedule jobs (cards) on 1200 machines such that the makespan (maximum load on any machine) is minimized. But in scheduling, the goal is usually to minimize the makespan, given the jobs. However, here, the jobs have sizes between 0 and 1, and we need to find the minimal makespan such that 1200 machines can handle any jobs with total size at most 1000.\n\nIn scheduling terms, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal c such that any set of jobs with total size S ≤1000 can be scheduled on 1200 machines with each machine's load ≤c. So we need to find the minimal c that works for any job set.\n\nIn scheduling theory, there's a result called the \"load balancing\" problem. For parallel machines, the minimal c is at least S / m, where m is the number of machines. But in our case, S can be up to 1000, and m is 1200. So S/m is 1000/1200 = 5/6 ≈0.8333. However, because the jobs can be of size up to 1, you can't have a c lower than 1, because a single job of size 1 would require a box by itself. But since the total sum is ≤1000, the number of jobs is at least 1000 (if all jobs are size 1). Wait, but if the jobs can be smaller, then there can be more jobs. But if all jobs are size 1, then you have 1000 jobs, and you need to fit them into 1200 boxes. Then each box can contain at most 1 job, so you need 1000 boxes, leaving 200 boxes empty. So in that case, c can be 1. But if the jobs are smaller, say size 0.5, then you have 2000 jobs, and you can fit 2 jobs into each box, so 2000 / 2 = 1000 boxes, but we have 1200 boxes. So you could have 2 boxes with 2 jobs each (sum 1) and the remaining 1000 boxes with 1 job each (sum 0.5). Wait, no: if you have 2000 jobs of 0.5, each box can take 2 jobs, sum 1. But 1200 boxes can hold 2400 jobs. So with 2000 jobs, you can pack all into 1000 boxes (each with 2 jobs), but since we have 1200 boxes, we could have 1000 boxes filled with 2 jobs each, and 200 boxes empty. So c would still be 1, since each box with 2 jobs sums to 1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is when there are large jobs. For example, if there's one job of size 1 and the rest are 0, then you need at least 1 box with sum 1, and the rest can be 0. So c would have to be at least 1. But if the total sum is 1000, and all jobs are 1, then you have 1000 jobs, which can be packed into 1000 boxes, each with 1 job. So c can be 1 here as well. But if there are jobs of size approaching 1, then you can't pack them more efficiently. So maybe c=1 is sufficient? But the problem says \"Find the smallest c>0 such that ...\". If c=1 works, then that's the answer. But maybe not?\n\nWait, but the problem states that the numbers on the cards are in [0,1], but they don't have to be integers. So, for example, you have a card with 1, and others with fractions. But even if you have a single card with 1, you can't put it in a box with anything else without exceeding c=1. But if you have multiple cards with 1, but their total sum is ≤1000, but each card is at most 1, then you can have at most 1000 cards of 1. Then, you need to pack those 1000 cards into 1200 boxes. So you can put one card in each of 1000 boxes, and the remaining 200 boxes are empty. So the maximum sum in any box is 1. Similarly, if you have a card with 0.5, you can pair them up. So if you have 2000 cards of 0.5, you can pair them into boxes of two, sum 1. So with 1200 boxes, you can hold 2400 cards. So if you have 2000 cards, you can pack them into 1000 boxes, and leave 200 boxes empty. So again, the maximum sum is 1.\n\nBut perhaps the worst case is when you have a lot of cards just below 1, say 0.999, which you can't pair up. For example, if you have 1000 cards of 1, you can't pair them, but if you have 1001 cards of 0.999, then each box can take one card, so you need 1001 boxes, but you only have 1200. So you need to leave 199 boxes empty. But the problem states that the total sum is at most 1000. If you have 1001 cards of 0.999, the total sum would be approximately 1001*0.999 ≈1000 - 0.001, which is still ≤1000. So in this case, you need to pack 1001 cards into 1200 boxes. Each box can take at most one card (since 0.999*2 =1.998>1, which would exceed c=1). So you need 1001 boxes, but we only have 1200. So the remaining 199 boxes can be left empty. Therefore, in this case, c=1 is still sufficient.\n\nWait, but if you have a card that is almost 1, say 1 - ε, then you can't fit two such cards into a box without exceeding c=1. So if you have many cards just below 1, you can't pair them up. But since the total sum is limited, how many such cards can you have? For example, if each card is 1 - ε, then the number of cards n satisfies n*(1 - ε) ≤1000. So n ≤1000 / (1 - ε). As ε approaches 0, n approaches 1000. So if ε is very small, you can have almost 1000 cards. But each card is almost 1, so each box can hold at most one such card. Therefore, you need almost 1000 boxes. But since we have 1200 boxes, we can leave 200 boxes empty. So even in this case, c=1 is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, maybe c=1 is the answer. But wait, the problem says \"the sum of the getallen op de kaartjes is杪stens 1000\", so the total sum is at most 1000. So the number of cards can be up to 1000 / 0.000...1, which is infinitely many, but since the number of cards is finite, as per the problem statement: \"eindig number of kaartjes\". So the number of cards is finite, but we don't know how many. However, given the total sum is at most 1000, and each card is at most 1, the number of cards is at least 1000 (if all cards are 1) and up to 1000 / ε for any ε>0. But since ε can be arbitrarily small, the number of cards can be arbitrarily large. However, since the problem states that Elke has an eindig (finite) number of kaartjes, but doesn't specify a bound. So we need to consider the worst case where the number of cards is as large as possible, given the total sum is ≤1000.\n\nBut even with infinitely many cards (each approaching 0), you can pack them into 1200 boxes, each containing a finite number of cards. Since each card is arbitrarily small, you can fit as many as you want into a box without exceeding c. So the problem reduces to dealing with the worst-case scenarios where the cards are as large as possible (close to 1) or as small as possible (close to 0).\n\nBut from the previous examples, in all cases, c=1 seems sufficient. However, maybe there's a scenario where c needs to be larger? For example, if you have a combination of large and small cards that can't be packed efficiently.\n\nWait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose there are 1000 cards of 1 and 200 cards of 0. Then the total sum is 1000", "answer": "11-\\frac{1}{91}"}

This seems like a problem that might involve optimization techniques, maybe using calculus or inequalities like AM-GM. Let me recall that the AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, and equality holds when all the terms are equal. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nBut the expression has multiple variables, so I need to consider each variable's contribution. Let me see. The terms involving \\( x \\) are \\( xy \\), \\( zx \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). Similarly, the terms with \\( y \\) are \\( xy \\), \\( yz \\), and \\( \\frac{2}{y} \\). For \\( z \\), it's \\( yz \\), \\( zx \\), and \\( \\frac{5}{z} \\). \n\nThis seems complex because each variable is involved in multiple terms.

For example, \\( x \\) is in \\( xy \\) and \\( zx \\), but also \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). So maybe it's better to think of each variable's total contribution and set their derivatives to zero.

To find the minimum, I need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), set them equal to zero, and solve the system of equations.\n\nFirst, partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y + z - \\frac{1}{x^2}\n\\]\nSetting this equal to zero:\n\\[\ny + z - \\frac{1}{x^2} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + z = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\nNext, partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x + z - \\frac{2}{y^2}\n\\]\nSetting equal to zero:\n\\[\nx + z = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nPartial derivative with respect to \\( z \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = y + x - \\frac{5}{z^2}\n\\]\nSetting equal to zero:\n\\[\nx + y = \\frac{5}{z^2} \\quad (3)\n\\]\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n1. \\( y + z = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\)\n2. \\( x + z = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\)\n3. \\( x + y = \\frac{5}{z^2} \\)\n\nWe need to solve for \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\).

Let me suppose that \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\) are constants that satisfy these equations. Let me try to assign numerical values by trial.\n\nSuppose we start with an initial guess. Let's assume \\( x = 1 \\), then from equation (1): \\( y + z = 1 \\). Then from equation (2): \\( 1 + z = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\). If \\( y + z = 1 \\), then \\( z = 1 - y \\).

Let's check for rational roots. Possible roots are \\( \\pm1 \\), \\( \\pm2 \\).\n\nTesting \\( y = 1 \\): \\( 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( y = 2 \\): \\( 8 - 8 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( y = -1 \\): Negative, since we are dealing with positive variables. So no rational roots. This approach might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with another initial guess. Let's suppose \\( x = 0.5 \\). Then from equation (1): \\( y + z = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\). Then from equation (2): \\( 0.5 + z = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\). Let \\( z = 4 - y \\), so:\n\n\\( 0.5 + 4 - y = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4.5 - y = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( y^2 \\):\n\n\\( 4.5y^2 - y^3 = 2 \\)\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\( y^3 - 4.5y^2 + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nAgain, not easy to solve. Maybe this trial and error isn't the way to go. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps using Lagrange multipliers? But since there are no constraints other than positivity, maybe calculus is still the way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the variables \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\) such that each pair product contributes to the expression. Let me try to apply AM-GM inequality on the terms.\n\nLooking at the terms involving \\( xy \\), \\( yz \\), \\( zx \\), and the reciprocals. Let me group them as follows:\n\nGroup 1: \\( xy \\), \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\), \\( \\frac{2}{y} \\)\n\nGroup 2: \\( yz \\), \\( \\frac{2}{y} \\), \\( \\frac{5}{z} \\)\n\nGroup 3: \\( zx \\), \\( \\frac{5}{z} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\)\n\nWait, but these groupings might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe split the terms into variables and apply AM-GM per variable.\n\nWait, each variable appears in two quadratic terms and one reciprocal term. For example, \\( x \\) appears in \\( xy \\), \\( zx \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). So maybe for each variable, apply AM-GM to the three terms.\n\nLet's try that for variable \\( x \\):\n\nThe terms are \\( xy \\), \\( zx \\), \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\nApplying AM-GM inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xy + zx + \\frac{1}{x}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{xy \\cdot zx \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}} = \\sqrt[3]{y z x}\n\\]\n\nBut this gives \\( xy + zx + \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{x y z} \\). Hmm, but the right-hand side is still in terms of \\( x y z \\), which complicates things.\n\nSimilarly, for variable \\( y \\):\n\nTerms: \\( xy \\), \\( yz \\), \\( \\frac{2}{y} \\)\n\nAM-GM:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xy + yz + \\frac{2}{y}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{xy \\cdot yz \\cdot \\frac{2}{y}} = \\sqrt[3]{2 x z}\n\\]\n\nSo \\( xy + yz + \\frac{2}{y} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{2 x z} \\)\n\nFor variable \\( z \\):\n\nTerms: \\( yz \\), \\( zx \\), \\( \\frac{5}{z} \\)\n\nAM-GM:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{yz + zx + \\frac{5}{z}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{yz \\cdot zx \\cdot \\frac{5}{z}} = \\sqrt[3]{5 x y}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( yz + zx + \\frac{5}{z} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{5 x y} \\)\n\nBut then adding up these inequalities:\n\n\\[\n(xy + zx + \\frac{1}{x}) + (xy + yz + \\frac{2}{y}) + (yz + zx + \\frac{5}{z}) \\geq 3 (\\sqrt[3]{x y z} + \\sqrt[3]{2 x z} + \\sqrt[3]{5 x y})\n\\]\n\nBut the left side is \\( 2xy + 2yz + 2zx + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{y} + \\frac{5}{z} \\). Our original expression is \\( xy + yz + zx + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{y} + \\frac{5}{z} \\). So the left side is twice the quadratic terms plus the reciprocals. Therefore, if we can bound the quadratic terms, maybe we can find the minimum.\n\nBut this approach seems to lead to a more complicated expression rather than a concrete minimum. Maybe instead of applying AM-GM to each variable's terms, we need to balance the terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the original function:\n\n\\[\nf(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{y} + \\frac{5}{z}\n\\]\n\nWe can think of this as the sum of quadratic terms and reciprocal terms. Maybe set up partial derivatives as I did before and solve the system.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\n1. \\( y + z = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\)\n2. \\( x + z = \\frac{2}{y^2} \\)\n3. \\( x + y = \\frac{5}{z^2} \\)\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of one variable.\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( y = \\frac{1}{x^2} - z \\)\n\nFrom equation (2): \\( x = \\frac{2}{", "answer": "3\\sqrt[3]{36}"}

So, we need to find the largest real number M such that for any infinite sequence of real numbers x₀, x₁, x₂, ... satisfying:\n\na) x₀ = 1 and x₁ = 3,\n\nb) For all n ≥ 0, the sum from x₀ to x_{n-1} is greater than or equal to 3x_n - x_{n+1},\n\nit follows that x_{n+1}/x_n > M for all n ≥ 0.\n\nHmm, the key here is probably to translate the inequality condition into something that relates x_{n+1} and x_n, then find the minimal lower bound M that works for all possible sequences. Since we need the largest such M, we should look for the minimal possible value of x_{n+1}/x_n across all n, and then M would be the infimum of these ratios. But since the problem states that the inequality must hold for all n ≥ 0, M has to be less than or equal to all those ratios, so the maximum M is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the ratios x_{n+1}/x_n over all n.\n\nBut maybe we can approach this recursively. Let's start by writing down the given conditions.\n\nFirst, x₀ = 1, x₁ = 3. For n=0, the inequality becomes x₀ ≥ 3x₁ - x₂. Let's compute that:\n\nx₀ ≥ 3x₁ - x₂\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n1 ≥ 3*3 - x₂\n\n1 ≥ 9 - x₂\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\nx₂ ≥ 9 - 1 = 8\n\nTherefore, x₂ must be at least 8. Then, the ratio x₂/x₁ is 8/3 ≈ 2.666...\n\nNext, for n=1, the inequality is x₀ + x₁ ≥ 3x₂ - x₃\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 ≥ 3*8 - x₃\n\n4 ≥ 24 - x₃\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\nx₃ ≥ 24 - 4 = 20\n\nTherefore, x₃ must be at least 20. Then, the ratio x₃/x₂ is 20/8 = 2.5.\n\nFor n=2, the inequality is x₀ + x₁ + x₂ ≥ 3x₃ - x₄\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 + 3 + 8 = 12 ≥ 3*20 - x₄\n\n12 ≥ 60 - x₄\n\nThus, x₄ ≥ 60 - 12 = 48\n\nSo, x₄/x₃ = 48/20 = 2.4.\n\nContinuing this pattern, for n=3, the inequality is x₀ + x₁ + x₂ + x₃ ≥ 3x₄ - x₅\n\nSum of first four terms: 1 + 3 + 8 + 20 = 32\n\nSo:\n\n32 ≥ 3*48 - x₅\n\n32 ≥ 144 - x₅\n\nThus, x₅ ≥ 144 - 32 = 112\n\nRatio x₅/x₄ = 112/48 ≈ 2.333...\n\nFor n=4, the sum is 1 + 3 + 8 + 20 + 48 = 80\n\nThen:\n\n80 ≥ 3*112 - x₆\n\n80 ≥ 336 - x₆\n\nx₆ ≥ 336 - 80 = 256\n\nRatio x₆/x₅ = 256/112 = 2.2857...\n\nHmm, so the ratios are decreasing: 8/3 ≈2.666, 20/8=2.5, 48/20=2.4, 112/48≈2.333, 256/112≈2.2857...\n\nThis seems like each ratio is roughly decreasing by 0.1666... each time? But maybe not exactly. Let's compute the next one to check.\n\nn=5: sum is 1+3+8+20+48+112= 192\n\nThen:\n\n192 ≥ 3*256 - x₇\n\n192 ≥ 768 - x₇\n\nx₇ ≥ 768 - 192 = 576\n\nx₇/x₆ = 576/256 = 2.25\n\nSo, 2.25. Then for n=6:\n\nsum is 1+3+8+20+48+112+256= 448\n\n448 ≥ 3*576 - x₈\n\n448 ≥ 1728 - x₈\n\nx₈ ≥ 1728 - 448 = 1280\n\nx₈/x₇ = 1280/576 ≈ 2.222...\n\nSo, 2.222..., which is 20/9 ≈2.222...\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=7: sum is 1+3+8+20+48+112+256+576= 1024\n\n1024 ≥ 3*1280 - x₉\n\n1024 ≥ 3840 - x₉\n\nx₉ ≥ 3840 - 1024 = 2816\n\nx₉/x₈ = 2816/1280 = 2.2\n\nSo, 2.2. Then n=8:\n\nsum is 1+3+8+20+48+112+256+576+1280= 2304\n\n2304 ≥ 3*2816 - x_{10}\n\n2304 ≥ 8448 - x_{10}\n\nx_{10} ≥ 8448 - 2304 = 6144\n\nx_{10}/x₉ = 6144/2816 ≈ 2.1818...\n\nHmm, so it's decreasing each time. The ratios seem to be approaching 2? Let's check the next one.\n\nn=9: sum is 1+3+8+20+48+112+256+576+1280+2816= 5120\n\n5120 ≥ 3*6144 - x_{11}\n\n5120 ≥ 18432 - x_{11}\n\nx_{11} ≥ 18432 - 5120 = 13312\n\nx_{11}/x_{10} = 13312/6144 ≈ 2.1736...\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=10: sum is 5120 + 6144 = 11264\n\n11264 ≥ 3*13312 - x_{12}\n\n11264 ≥ 39936 - x_{12}\n\nx_{12} ≥ 39936 - 11264 = 28672\n\nx_{12}/x_{11} = 28672/13312 ≈ 2.1538...\n\nSo, the ratios are decreasing each time but approaching 2. Each ratio is slightly less than the previous one. So maybe the infimum of these ratios is 2? But the problem says \"voor alle n ≥ 0\", so we need to ensure that all ratios are greater than M. If the ratios approach 2, then M can be at most 2, but we need to check if 2 is actually attainable or if we can get arbitrarily close to 2.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"voor elke oneindige rij\" (for every infinite sequence) that satisfies the conditions, we have x_{n+1}/x_n > M. So, M has to be a lower bound for all possible ratios across all n. Since in the sequence we constructed, the ratios are approaching 2, if we set M=2, then for sufficiently large n, the ratio would be less than 2, which would violate the condition. Therefore, M must be less than or equal to 2. But we need the largest M such that for all sequences, the ratio is greater than M. So, perhaps the minimal limit point of the ratios in any such sequence is 2, meaning that M=2 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but maybe there exists another sequence where the ratios approach a higher lower bound?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"voor elke oneindigerij\" that satisfies the given conditions. So, regardless of how you choose the sequence (as long as it meets a) and b)), you must have x_{n+1}/x_n > M for all n. So, M is the minimal such lower bound that works for all possible sequences. Therefore, M is the infimum over all possible sequences of the infimum of the ratios. Wait, no, actually, since we need that for all sequences, all ratios are above M. Therefore, M is the minimal value such that every sequence has all ratios above M. So, M is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the infima over sequences.\n\nAlternatively, M is the infimum over all possible sequences of the infimum over n of x_{n+1}/x_n. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's consider the inequality:\n\nx₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1} ≥ 3x_n - x_{n+1}\n\nRearranged, this gives:\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - (x₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1})\n\nBut the left-hand side is x_{n+1}, and the right-hand side is 3x_n minus the sum of previous terms.\n\nBut perhaps we can express this recursively. Let's denote S_n = x₀ + x₁ + ... + x_n. Then, the inequality becomes:\n\nS_{n-1} ≥ 3x_n - x_{n+1}\n\nBut S_{n} = S_{n-1} + x_n, so x_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nBut S_{n-1} = x₀ + ... + x_{n-1}\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the recurrence in terms of x_{n+1} in terms of previous terms.\n\nWait, let's try to write the inequality as:\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - (x₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1})\n\nBut the sum x₀ + ... + x_{n-1} is S_{n-1}. So,\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nBut S_{n} = S_{n-1} + x_n, so S_{n-1} = S_n - x_n\n\nWait, substituting that into the inequality:\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - (S_n - x_n) = 4x_n - S_n\n\nBut S_n = S_{n-1} + x_n, which we already have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express S_n in terms of previous S:\n\nBut maybe this approach isn't straightforward. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we consider the inequality for each n:\n\nx₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1} ≥ 3x_n - x_{n+1}\n\nLet me rearrange this inequality:\n\nx_{n+1} + (x₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1}) ≥ 3x_n\n\nBut x₀ + x₁ + ... + x_{n-1} is equal to S_{n-1}, so:\n\nx_{n+1} + S_{n-1} ≥ 3x_n\n\nBut S_{n} = S_{n-1} + x_n, so S_{n-1} = S_n - x_n\n\nSubstituting back:\n\nx_{n+1} + (S_n - x_n) ≥ 3x_n\n\nTherefore:\n\nx_{n+1} + S_n - x_n ≥ 3x_n\n\nThen:\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 3x_n - S_n + x_n = 4x_n - S_n\n\nBut S_n = S_{n-1} + x_n, so:\n\nx_{n+1} ≥ 4x_n - (S_{n-1} + x_n) = 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nWhich is the original inequality. So maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of this as a linear recurrence. Suppose we try to find a sequence where equality holds, i.e., x_{n+1} = 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nIf we can find such a sequence, maybe it will give us the extremal ratios. Because if we have equality, then any deviation from it (i.e., x_{n+1} > 3x_n - S_{n-1}) would allow higher ratios. So, perhaps the minimal ratio occurs when equality holds, and any other sequence would have higher ratios? Hmm, not sure. Let's try to see.\n\nAssume that for some n, equality holds: x_{n+1} = 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nLet me compute S_{n} = S_{n-1} + x_n\n\nIf we have equality, then:\n\nx_{n+1} = 3x_n - S_{n-1}\n\nBut S_{n} = S_{n-1} + x_n, so S_{n-1} = S_n - x_n\n\nTherefore:\n\nx_{n+1} = 3x_n - (S_n - x_n) = 4x_n - S_n\n\nBut S_n = S_{n-1} + x_n = (3x_{n-1} - S_{n-2}) + x_n, if we assume equality for n-1.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe instead, let's try to model this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined in terms of previous terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the ratios r_n = x_{n+1}/x_n, and try to express the inequality in terms of these ratios.\n\nGiven that x_{n+1} = r_n x", "answer": "2"}

So, we need to find all natural numbers n such that σ(n) = τ(n) multiplied by the ceiling of the square root of n. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what τ(n) and σ(n) mean. τ(n) is the number of divisors of n, right? And σ(n) is the sum of those divisors. So the equation we need is σ(n) = τ(n) * ⎡√n⎤, where ⎡x⎤ is the ceiling function, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nSo, for each natural number n, we need to check if the sum of its divisors equals the number of its divisors times the ceiling of its square root. Interesting. Let me start by testing small natural numbers and see if they satisfy the equation. Maybe there's a pattern or maybe only certain numbers work.\n\nLet's start with n=1. The divisors of 1 are just [1]. So τ(1) = 1, σ(1) = 1. The square root of 1 is 1, so the ceiling is 1. Then τ(1)*ceil(√1) = 1*1 = 1. So σ(1) = τ(1)*ceil(√1) holds. So n=1 is a solution.\n\nNext, n=2. Divisors are [1,2]. So τ(2)=2, σ(2)=3. √2 ≈1.414, so ceil(√2)=2. Then τ(2)*ceil(√2)=2*2=4. But σ(2)=3 ≠4. So n=2 is not a solution.\n\nn=3.

Wait, σ(12) is 1+2+3+4+6+12=28. τ(12) is 6. √12 is about 3.464, so ceil is 4. So 6*4=24. 28≠24. So n=12 isn't a solution. Okay.\n\nWait, so maybe the solutions are primes?

So n=2 is prime but not a solution. n=3: prime, works. n=5: prime, works. n=7: prime, doesn't work. So primes aren't all solutions. Hmm.\n\nWait, n=1 is not prime. So maybe n=1 is a special case.

So 4*3=12. So in this case, σ(n) equals τ(n) times the ceiling of sqrt(n). So the sum of divisors equals the number of divisors times the ceiling of sqrt(n). For n=6, the divisors are 1,2,3,6. The sum is 12. τ(n)=4. The ceiling of sqrt(6) is 3. So 4*3=12. So that works. Similarly, for n=3: divisors 1,3. Sum 4. τ=2. ceil(sqrt(3))=2. 2*2=4. For n=5: divisors 1,5. Sum 6. τ=2. ceil(sqrt(5))=3. 2*3=6. So in these cases, the sum of divisors is equal to τ(n) times the ceiling of sqrt(n). For primes like 2,7,11,13,17,19,23, etc., the sum of divisors is 1 + p, which is τ(n)=2, so we have 1 + p = 2 * ceil(sqrt(p)). Let's analyze this.\n\nSuppose n is a prime number. Then τ(n)=2, and σ(n)=1 + n. So the equation becomes 1 + n = 2 * ceil(sqrt(n)). Let's denote p as prime. So 1 + p = 2 * ceil(sqrt(p)). Let's solve for p.\n\nLet’s let k = ceil(sqrt(p)). Then k - 1 < sqrt(p) ≤ k. Squaring, (k - 1)^2 < p ≤ k^2. Since p is prime, p must be in ( (k - 1)^2, k^2 ] and prime.\n\nSo the equation 1 + p = 2k => p = 2k -1. So p must be 2k -1, and also p must satisfy (k -1)^2 < 2k -1 ≤ k^2.\n\nSo let's solve for k:\n\nFirst inequality: (k -1)^2 < 2k -1", "answer": "1, 3, 5, 6"}

So, we have n boxes (where n > 1) and n+1 identical stones. We need to distribute these stones into the boxes, and each distribution is a way to put the stones such that each stone is in exactly one box. Then, two distributions are considered neighbors if you can turn one into the other by moving exactly one stone to a different box. The \"gity\" of a distribution is the number of distributions that are adjacent to it in this sense. We need to find the average gity over all possible distributions.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have n boxes and n+1 stones. Each stone must go into a box, so each distribution is a sequence of numbers (x1, x2, ..., xn) where each xi is a non-negative integer, and the sum of all xi is n+1. The gity of a distribution is the number of other distributions that can be reached by moving exactly one stone from one box to another. The average gity is the average of all these gity numbers over all possible distributions.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the expected value of the gity when choosing a distribution uniformly at random.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can first compute the number of possible distributions. Since we have n boxes and n+1 stones, the number of distributions is the combination with repetition: C(n + (n+1) -1, n+1) = C(2n, n+1). But maybe I don't need the exact number right away.\n\nInstead, for a given distribution, I need to compute how many neighbors it has. Each neighbor is obtained by moving one stone from one box to another. So, for a given distribution (x1, x2, ..., xn), the number of neighbors would be the number of ways to pick a source box and a target box, move a stone from the source to the target, provided that the move is allowed.\n\nBut since stones are identical, moving a stone from box i to box j is only allowed if xi > 0 and xj < some value? Wait, no. Wait, each stone is identical, but once you move a stone from box i to box j, it's a different distribution because the counts change. But if you move a stone from box i to box j, you have to subtract 1 from xi and add 1 to xj. So, as long as xi >= 1 and xj >= 0, this is allowed. Wait, but xj can be 0. So, moving a stone from i to j is possible if xi >= 1, regardless of xj. Because even if xj is 0, adding 1 to xj would make it 1, which is allowed. So, the number of neighbors for a distribution (x1, x2, ..., xn) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j, such that moving a stone from i to j results in a different distribution. But since the stones are identical, moving from i to j and then from j to i would result in the same distribution as the original? Wait, no. Let's see: Suppose we have distribution (x1, x2, ..., xn). If we move a stone from i to j, we get (x1, ..., xi-1, xj+1, ..., xj+1, ..., xn). Similarly, moving a stone from j to i would give (x1, ..., xj-1, xi+1, ..., xi+1, ..., xn). These are different distributions unless xi = xj. Wait, but since the stones are identical, the order of moving stones doesn't matter. Wait, but in this problem, a neighbor is defined as a distribution that can be reached by moving exactly one stone. So, moving a stone from i to j is a neighbor, regardless of the previous configuration. So, the total number of neighbors is the number of possible moves, which is n(n-1) if all boxes have at least 1 stone? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, the number of neighbors for a distribution depends on how many stones are in each box. For each box i, if xi > 0, then you can move a stone from i to any other box j (j ≠ i). So, for each box i with xi > 0, there are (n - 1) possible moves (to each of the other boxes). Therefore, the total number of neighbors is the sum over all boxes i of (xi) choose 1 multiplied by (n - 1). Wait, no. Wait, if in box i, there are xi stones, then the number of stones you can move from i is xi, since each stone can be moved to any other box. But since moving a stone from i to j changes the distribution, each such move is a different neighbor. So, for each box i with xi > 0, you can choose any other box j, and move 1 stone from i to j. Therefore, the number of neighbors is sum_{i=1 to n} (xi * (n - 1)). Because for each box i, if xi > 0, you can move a stone to any of the (n - 1) other boxes. So, the total number of neighbors is (n - 1) * sum_{i=1 to n} xi. But sum_{i=1 to n} xi is n + 1. Therefore, the number of neighbors is (n - 1)*(n + 1) = n² - 1. Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean every distribution has exactly n² - 1 neighbors, which is impossible since the number of distributions is C(2n, n+1), which is way larger than n² - 1. So, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, two distributions are neighbors if you can get from one to the other by moving exactly one stone. So, each neighbor is a distribution that differs by exactly one stone moved from one box to another. So, for a given distribution, how many neighbors does it have? For each stone in the distribution, you can move it to any other box. But since the stones are identical, moving any stone from box i to box j is the same as moving another stone from i to j. So, the number of neighbors is equal to the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j, such that moving a stone from i to j changes the distribution. However, since the stones are identical, the number of neighbors is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (xi * (n - 1)), as before. But then, sum_{i=1 to n} xi = n + 1, so total neighbors would be (n - 1)*(n + 1) = n² - 1. But that would imply that every distribution has exactly n² - 1 neighbors, which is impossible because the number of neighbors can vary depending on the distribution. For example, if all stones are in one box, then you can move that stone to any of the other n - 1 boxes, so it has (n - 1) neighbors. But if the stones are spread out, each box has at least one stone, then each box can send stones to n - 1 boxes, so each box contributes (xi) * (n - 1) neighbors. Wait, but if all boxes have at least one stone, then xi >= 1 for all i, so each box can send a stone to (n - 1) boxes, so total neighbors would be n*(n - 1). But n*(n - 1) is different from n² - 1. Wait, n*(n - 1) = n² - n, which is different from n² - 1. So, clearly my initial reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think again. The number of neighbors for a distribution (x1, x2, ..., xn) is the number of ways to choose a stone and move it to a different box. Since the stones are identical, the number of neighbors is equal to the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j, and moving a stone from box i to box j. However, each stone is in a specific box, so moving any stone from i to j is equivalent to moving a stone from i to j. Therefore, the total number of neighbors is equal to the number of stones times the number of possible targets for each stone. But since the stones are identical, moving a stone from i to j is the same regardless of which stone you move. Therefore, the total number of neighbors is equal to the number of stones times the number of possible targets, divided by the number of stones (since they are identical). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of multiset permutations. Each distribution is a multiset of stones in boxes. Moving a stone from i to j changes the counts by decreasing xi by 1 and increasing xj by 1. So, each neighbor is a multiset obtained by changing one element in the original distribution. Therefore, the number of neighbors is equal to the number of possible moves: for each stone in the distribution, move it to a different box. Since the stones are identical, the number of neighbors is equal to the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j, such that moving a stone from i to j results in a different distribution.\n\nBut in reality, each stone is in a specific box, so moving any stone from i to j is equivalent. Therefore, the total number of neighbors is equal to the number of stones times the number of possible destinations for each stone. Since we have n+1 stones, each can be moved to (n - 1) boxes (excluding their current box). However, since the stones are identical, moving any stone from i to j is the same as moving another stone from i to j. Therefore, the total number of neighbors is equal to the number of stones times the number of destinations for each stone, but since they are identical, we don't overcount. Wait, actually, no. Because even though the stones are identical, the act of moving a stone from i to j is unique. For example, suppose you have two stones in box 1. Moving the first stone from 1 to 2 is a different action than moving the second stone from 1 to 2, but since the stones are identical, these result in the same distribution. Therefore, the number of neighbors is actually equal to the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j and xi >= 1. Because for each box i with at least one stone, you can move a stone from i to any of the other n - 1 boxes. However, since multiple stones can be moved from the same box to the same target, but the distributions are considered the same regardless of which stone is moved. Therefore, the number of neighbors is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (xi * (n - 1)). Because for each stone in box i, you can move it to any of the n - 1 other boxes. Since there are xi stones in box i, each can be moved to any of the n - 1 boxes. However, since the stones are identical, moving different stones from i to j results in the same distribution. Wait, but actually, if you move a stone from i to j, it's a single distribution change. So, even if you have multiple stones in i, moving each one to j would result in different distributions. Wait, no. Wait, suppose you have two stones in box i. Moving the first stone to j gives a distribution where box i has xi - 1 and box j has xj + 1. Moving the second stone to j gives a distribution where box i has xi - 2 and box j has xj + 2. These are different distributions. Therefore, even though the stones are identical, moving different stones from i to j results in different distributions. Therefore, the number of neighbors is indeed sum_{i=1 to n} (xi * (n - 1)). Because for each stone in box i, you can choose to move it to any of the n - 1 other boxes. Each such move results in a unique distribution. Therefore, the total number of neighbors is sum_{i=1 to n} (xi * (n - 1)).\n\nBut wait, that would be (n - 1) * sum_{i=1 to n} xi. Since sum_{i=1 to n} xi = n + 1, this would give (n - 1)*(n + 1) = n² - 1. But that can't be right because n² - 1 is a constant, which would mean every distribution has the same number of neighbors, which contradicts intuition. For example, if all stones are in one box, say box 1, then you can move that stone to any of the other n - 1 boxes, resulting in n - 1 neighbors. But according to this formula, sum_{i=1 to n} xi = n + 1, so (n - 1)*(n + 1) = n² - 1. But if all stones are in one box, then sum xi = n + 1, so the formula gives n² - 1 neighbors, but in reality, moving the stones from that box to others would give n - 1 neighbors. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if all stones are in box 1, then xi = n + 1 for i = 1, and xi = 0 for i >= 2. Then, sum_{i=1 to n} xi * (n - 1) = (n + 1)*(n - 1) + 0 + ... + 0 = (n + 1)*(n - 1). But in reality, moving a stone from box 1 to any of the other n - 1 boxes would result in a different distribution. Since there are n + 1 stones in box 1, each can be moved to any of the n - 1 boxes, but moving different stones from box 1 to the same box j would result in the same distribution. Wait, but actually, each move results in a unique distribution. For example, moving stone 1 from box 1 to box 2 gives a distribution where box 1 has n stones and box 2 has 2 stones. Moving stone 2 from box 1 to box 2 gives box 1 has n stones and box 2 has 2 stones. Wait, but these are the same distribution. Wait, no. Wait, the stones are identical, so the order in which you move them doesn't matter. So, moving any stone from box 1 to box 2 results in the same distribution. Therefore, even though there are n + 1 stones in box 1, moving any of them to box 2 results in the same distribution. Therefore, the number of neighbors in this case is n - 1, not (n + 1)*(n - 1). So, my previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. When we have multiple stones in a box, moving different stones from that box to the same target box results in the same distribution. Therefore, the number of neighbors is not sum_{i=1 to n} (xi*(n - 1)),", "answer": "\\frac{n^2-1}{2}"}

Hmm, so there are 15 lamps, each numbered 1 to 15. All start off. There are 15 switches, each controlling two adjacent lamps. The switches are arranged in a circle because the last one connects lamp 15 to lamp 1. Each switch, when flipped, toggles the state of its two lamps. Raymond can flip any number of switches in one trip, and then go check the lamps in the other room. He needs to figure out which switch is which pair. The challenge is to do this in as few trips as possible.\n\nFirst, let's model this problem. Each switch corresponds to an edge in a circular graph with 15 nodes (lamps). Each switch affects two adjacent nodes. Raymond's goal is to identify each edge (switch) by observing the lamp states after flipping certain switches. Since the switches can be flipped in any order and multiple times, the key is to design a sequence of flips such that each switch's effect can be uniquely determined by the resulting lamp configurations.\n\nIn linear algebra terms, this is similar to solving a system of equations where each equation corresponds to a lamp's state after a series of flips, and each variable corresponds to whether a switch was flipped (1) or not (0). However, since the switches affect two lamps each, each equation (lamp) will have two variables (switches). But because the switches are arranged in a circle, the system is cyclic, making it a bit more complex.\n\nBut wait, Raymond can go into the room with the switches multiple times. Each time he can flip some switches and then observe the lamps. The problem is to find the minimum number of trips needed to uniquely determine all switches.\n\nThis seems similar to group testing or using multiple observations to disambiguate the switches. Let's think in terms of information theory. Each trip gives Raymond some information about the switches. Each lamp can be either on or off, so each lamp provides 1 bit of information per trip. However, since the switches affect two lamps each, flipping a switch affects two bits. So each trip can give up to 15 bits of information (since there are 15 lamps), but actually, it's 15 bits because each lamp's state is observed as a bit.\n\nBut how much information does each trip provide? If Raymond flips a subset of switches and then sees the lamp states, he can note which lamps are toggled. However, since the switches are arranged in a circle, the relationship between the switches and the lamps is fixed, but Raymond doesn't know which switch corresponds to which pair. So he needs to figure out a set of flips that allows him to deduce the correspondence.\n\nOne approach is to use a unique pattern of flips for each trip such that the resulting lamp states can be decoded to identify which switches were flipped. For example, if each switch is assigned a unique binary identifier, and Raymond flips switches corresponding to certain bits, then the resulting lamp states can be used to reconstruct the switches.\n\nBut since there are 15 switches, each needing a unique identifier, we need at least 4 trips (since 2^4=16 >15). However, this might not account for the cyclic nature of the problem. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the switches form a cycle to reduce the number of required trips.\n\nWait, let's consider the problem as a graph. The switches are edges in a cycle graph with 15 nodes. Raymond needs to identify each edge by performing operations (flipping edges) and observing the nodes (lamp states). This is similar to edge discovery in a graph through vertex observations.\n\nIn linear algebra terms, over the field GF(2), each switch flip corresponds to adding a vector with 1s in the positions corresponding to the two lamps it affects. The goal is to determine the incidence matrix of the graph, which in this case is a cycle graph. However, since Raymond doesn't know the correspondence, he needs to find a set of flip operations (vectors) such that the resulting observed vectors (lamp states) uniquely identify the edges.\n\nThis is similar to finding a separating system or using a set of tests to identify each element. In the case of a cycle graph, perhaps the number of trips required is related to the number of edges or the structure of the graph.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem of identifying each edge by its effect on the lamps. Each edge's effect is a pair of lamps. If Raymond can flip individual edges and see the result, he could identify each switch. But he can't flip individual switches; he can only flip any combination of switches. So he needs a way to uniquely determine each edge's pair.\n\nAnother angle: since each switch affects two lamps, flipping a switch twice cancels its effect. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to solving a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation corresponds to a lamp's state (sum of the switches affecting it modulo 2), and the variables are the switches. However, since Raymond doesn't know which switch corresponds to which pair, he needs to assign labels to the variables such that the resulting system can be solved.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of thinking in terms of linear algebra, think practically. For each switch, if Raymond can isolate its effect by not interfering with other switches, he can determine which pair it is. However, since the switches are connected in a cycle, flipping one switch affects two lamps and also connects to the next switch. Therefore, flipping a switch affects its two lamps and the next switch's lamps.\n\nWait, but if Raymond can perform a sequence of flips such that each switch is flipped exactly once, and no two flips overlap, then he could potentially determine which switch is which. But in a cycle of 15 switches, each switch overlaps with two others (the previous and next). Therefore, flipping all switches once would mean each lamp is toggled twice (since each lamp is part of two switches), resulting in all lamps being off again. That doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that flipping adjacent switches affects overlapping lamps. For example, flipping switch 1 affects lamps 1 and 2, flipping switch 2 affects lamps 2 and 3, etc. If Raymond flips a single switch, he sees two lamps turn on. If he flips two adjacent switches, he sees four lamps, but two of them are toggled twice (lamps 2 and 3 in the case of switches 1 and 2), so they end up off. Wait, no: each flip toggles the lamp's state. So flipping switch 1 turns on lamps 1 and 2, flipping switch 2 turns on lamps 2 and 3, but if he flips both, lamps 1 (toggled once), lamp 2 (toggled twice), lamp 3 (toggled once). So lamp 2 would be off again. Hmm, interesting.\n\nBut if Raymond can flip switches in such a way that each lamp is toggled a unique number of times, then he can determine which switches affected it. For example, if he performs a set of flips where each switch is included in a unique combination of flips, then the number of times each lamp is toggled (mod 2) will indicate which switches were flipped.\n\nBut since the switches form a cycle, there's a dependency among them. The total number of switches is 15, and each lamp is part of exactly two switches. Therefore, the system of equations is dependent, with rank 14 instead of 15. So maybe 14 equations (trips) are needed? But that seems too much.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a covering problem. Each trip gives information about certain switches. To uniquely identify each switch, Raymond needs enough information to distinguish each pair. Since each switch affects two lamps, the problem is similar to identifying edges in a graph by their effect on vertices through edge flips.\n\nIn the case of a cycle graph with n nodes, the number of edges is n. To identify each edge, you might need to perform operations that can isolate each edge's effect. For example, if you can flip an edge and see which two lamps change state, you can identify it. But since Raymond doesn't know which switch is which, he needs a way to cross-reference.\n\nWait, here's an idea. If Raymond can perform a sequence of flips such that each switch is flipped exactly once, but no two flips overlap. However, in a cycle of 15 switches, each switch overlaps with its neighbors. Therefore, flipping all switches once would result in overlapping toggles. But if he could flip non-overlapping pairs, but in a cycle of 15 (which is odd), you can't pair them all without overlap.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of a basis in linear algebra. The set of all possible switch flips forms a vector space over GF(2), with dimension 15 - 1 = 14 (since the cycle has a dependency). Therefore, to uniquely determine the basis, you might need 14 trips. But this seems too high.\n\nWait, but Raymond isn't trying to determine the entire incidence matrix, just each individual switch's pair. Maybe fewer trips are needed.\n\nAlternatively, think of each switch as a vector in a 15-dimensional vector space over GF(2), where each vector has 1s in the positions of the two lamps it affects. The goal is to determine which vector corresponds to which switch. This is equivalent to identifying a permutation of the 15 vectors (switches) such that each is uniquely identifiable by the observed effect on the lamps.\n\nIn coding theory, this is similar to designing a code where each codeword corresponds to a switch, and the observations allow decoding. The number of trips needed would be the number of codewords required to uniquely identify each switch.\n\nAlternatively, use the principle of unique identification through multiple observations. For example, if Raymond performs a set of flips where each switch is included in a unique combination of flips, then the resulting lamp states can be used to solve for which switches were flipped.\n\nThis is similar to using a set of tests where each item is assigned a unique binary identifier, and the presence or absence of each test (flip) allows determining the identity of the item. In this case, each switch would have a unique 0-1 vector indicating which flips were performed on it. However, since each switch affects two lamps, the identifiers would need to be designed such that each switch's pair can be uniquely identified by the combination of flips affecting its lamps.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Since the switches are arranged in a cycle, we can model them as edges in a cycle graph. To identify each edge, Raymond can perform a sequence of flips that correspond to edges in a different graph, such that the resulting observations can be used to reconstruct the original edges.\n\nFor example, if Raymond flips all edges except one, then the resulting lamp states can indicate which edge was not flipped. But this requires 14 trips, which is too many.\n\nAlternatively, use a binary search approach. But with 15 switches, binary search would take log2(15) ≈ 4 trips, but this might not work because each trip's result depends on the previous flips.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a matrix. Let's say each switch is a column in a 15x15 matrix where each column has two 1s corresponding to the lamps it affects. However, since the switches are in a cycle, this matrix is a circulant matrix with two 1s per row and column. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each lamp is part of two switches. So the state of each lamp is the sum (mod 2) of the two switches that affect it. If Raymond can solve for the switches based on the lamp states, he can determine which pairs they are.\n\nBut since he doesn't know which switch corresponds to which pair, he needs to assign labels to the switches based on the observations. This is similar to a permutation puzzle where you have to determine the correspondence between objects and labels through observations.\n\nIn permutation puzzles, the minimum number of queries needed to determine the permutation is often related to the number of elements. For example, sorting with comparisons requires log2(n!) comparisons, but here it's different because the observations are about the permutation's structure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each trip as a query that returns the parity of some subset of switches. If Raymond can design queries that allow him to determine the value of each switch (i.e., which pairs they are), then the number of queries needed would be related to the number of switches.\n\nBut since each switch affects two lamps, and each lamp is affected by two switches, the problem is similar to a system where each equation is the sum of two variables. However, in this case, the variables are the switches, and the equations are the lamp states. But since the system is underdetermined (15 variables with 15 equations, but the system is rank 14), there is a dependency.\n\nBut Raymond is not trying to solve for all variables, just to assign labels to each variable (switch) based on the observations. This might be possible with fewer queries.\n\nWait, here's a different idea inspired by information theory. Each lamp can be observed in multiple trips. Each trip provides information about the switches that affect those lamps. Since each switch affects two lamps, each switch is involved in two observations (trips). To uniquely determine each switch's identity, Raymond needs to have enough trips such that each switch is uniquely identified by the pattern of trips it was involved in.\n\nIf each switch is assigned a unique binary identifier corresponding to which trips it was flipped in, then the combination of lamp states (which are the sum of the switches affecting them) can be used to decode which switches were flipped. However, since each switch affects two lamps, the identifier would need to be such that the combination of flips for each switch can be uniquely determined by the resulting lamp states.\n\nThis is similar to designing a code where each codeword (switch) is a binary vector indicating membership in each trip, and the observed lamp states are the sum (mod 2) of the codewords for the switches affecting each lamp. To uniquely decode, the code must be such that the observed vectors (lamp states) can uniquely determine the codewords (switches).\n\nIn coding theory, this is similar to a disjunct matrix or a superimposed code. The number of trips needed would be the number of columns in the matrix such that each codeword is unique. The minimal number of trips required is the minimal number of tests such that the resulting observations can uniquely identify each switch.\n\nFor 15 switches, using 4 trips (since 2^4 = 16 >15) might suffice if each switch is assigned a unique 4-bit identifier. Then, each trip corresponds to a bit position, and flipping a switch corresponds to setting that bit. The resulting lamp states would be the sum (mod 2) of the identifiers of the switches affecting each lamp. However, since each lamp is affected by two switches, the lamp's state is the sum of two bit vectors. To decode, Raymond would need to solve for the two switches that contributed to each lamp's state.\n\nBut this might not work directly because the sum of two bit vectors modulo 2 is not straightforward. For example, if lamp 1 is affected by switches A and B, and lamp 2 is affected by switches B and C, the state of lamp 1 is A + B, and lamp 2 is B + C. If we have four trips, each corresponding to a bit, then the observed bits for each lamp would be", "answer": "4"}

Here, d is the smallest divisor of n that's larger than 1. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the smallest divisor of n greater than 1 is the smallest prime factor of n. That makes sense because if n is prime, then its smallest divisor greater than 1 is itself. If n is composite, it's the smallest prime that divides it. For example, if n is 12, the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2. So d is essentially the smallest prime factor of n.\n\nGiven that, the problem is to find n such that n = d³ + m³, where m divides n. So m is a divisor of n, and when you cube it and add to the cube of d (the smallest prime factor), you get n itself.\n\nLet me start by considering some small n and see if they fit. Maybe this will help me spot a pattern or figure out constraints.\n\nStarting with n = 2. The smallest divisor d is 2. Then we need m such that 2 = 2³ + m³. But 2³ is 8, so 8 + m³ = 2, which is impossible because m³ would have to be negative. So n=2 is out.\n\nNext, n=3. Similarly, d=3. Then 3 = 3³ + m³, which would require m³ = 3 - 27 = -24. Not possible. So n=3 is out.\n\nn=4. The smallest divisor d is 2. Then n = 2³ + m³ = 8 + m³. So m³ = 4 - 8 = -4. Still negative. Not possible.\n\nn=5. d=5. Then 5 = 125 + m³. Negative again. Not possible.\n\nn=6. The divisors are 2, 3, 6. The smallest d is 2. So n = 8 + m³. m must divide 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. But m must be positive, so possible m values are 2, 3, 6. Let's check:\n\nIf m=2: 8 + 8 = 16. But n=6 here. Not equal.\n\nm=3: 8 + 27 = 35 ≠6.\n\nm=6: 8 + 216=224≠6. So n=6 is out.\n\nn=7. d=7. 7=343 + m³. No.\n\nn=8. d=2. So n=8=8 + m³. So m³=0. But m must be a positive divisor, so m=0 isn't allowed. Thus, no solution.\n\nn=9. d=3. So 9=27 + m³. m³= -18. No.\n\nn=10. d=2. So 10=8 + m³. So m³=2. But 2 is not a cube. m would have to be cube root of 2, which is irrational. So no.\n\nn=12. d=2. So 12=8 + m³. Therefore, m³=4. Not a cube. No.\n\nn=14. d=2. 14=8 + m³. m³=6. Not a cube.\n\nn=15. d=3. 15=27 + m³. m³= -12. No.\n\nn=16. d=2. 16=8 + m³. m³=8. So m=2. But m must divide 16. 2 divides 16. So m=2. Let's check: d=2 (smallest divisor of 16), m=2. Then n=2³ + 2³=8+8=16. Yes! So n=16 works.\n\nSo n=16 is a solution. Let me note that down. Let's check if there are more solutions.\n\nn=18. d=2. So 18=8 + m³. m³=10. Not a cube. No.\n\nn=20. d=2. 20=8 + m³. m³=12. No.\n\nn=24. d=2. 24=8 + m³. m³=16. No.\n\nn=25. d=5. 25=125 + m³. No.\n\nn=16 seems to work. Let me check n=28. d=2. 28=8 + m³. m³=20. No.\n\nWait, maybe n=16 is a solution. Let's check n=27. d=3. 27=27 + m³. So m³=0. No.\n\nn=32. d=2. 32=8 + m³. m³=24. No.\n\nWait, perhaps n=16 is the only one so far. Let me check higher numbers.\n\nn=36. d=2. 36=8 + m³. m³=28. No.\n\nn=40. d=2. 40=8 + m³. m³=32. m= cube root of 32 ≈ 3.17. Not integer. So no.\n\nWait, m must divide n. So m is a divisor of n. So for example, if n is even, m can be 2, which is the smallest divisor. Let's think about n being even. Then d=2. So n=8 + m³. m must divide n. Let's suppose n is even. Then m can be 2, but m=2 would give n=16. Let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIf n is even, m could be another divisor. For example, n=16: m=2 works. What about n=8? If n=8, d=2. Then 8=8 + m³. So m³=0. Not possible. So n=16 is the only even n so far.\n\nWhat about odd n? Let's try n=25. d=5. 25=125 + m³. No. n=45. d=3. 45=27 + m³. m³=18. No. n=21. d=3. 21=27 + m³. m³= -6. No. n=27. d=3. 27=27 + m³. m=0. Not allowed. n=15. Already checked.\n\nWait, maybe n is an odd cube. For example, n=125. d=5. Then 125=125 + m³. So m=0. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n is a cube. Let's say n=8. Then d=2, m=2. But n=8 is not a cube. Wait, 16 is 2^4. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think algebraically. Let me denote n = d³ + m³, where d is the smallest prime factor of n, and m divides n.\n\nSince d is the smallest prime factor of n, then d divides n. So n is divisible by d. But m also divides n. So m is a divisor of n, which is divisible by d.\n\nTherefore, m can be any divisor of n, but in particular, m must divide n, which is d³ + m³. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, since d is the smallest prime factor of n, and m divides n, perhaps m is a multiple of d or coprime to d. Let's see.\n\nSuppose m is a multiple of d. Then m = k*d for some integer k ≥1. Then n = d³ + (k*d)³ = d³ + k³*d³ = d³*(1 + k³). So n would be divisible by d³. But since d is the smallest prime factor of n, then n is divisible by d, but if n is divisible by d³, that's possible. Let me check if such n exists.\n\nFor example, take d=2. Then n=8*(1 +k³). So n=8*(1 +k³). But n must also be divisible by d=2. Which it is. Let's take k=1: n=8*(1+1)=16. Which works, as we saw earlier.\n\nk=2: n=8*(1+8)=8*9=72. Let's check if 72 works. n=72. d=2 (smallest prime factor). Then m must divide 72 and 72=8 + m³. So m³=72 -8=64. So m=4. Check if 4 divides 72. Yes, 72/4=18. So m=4. Then n=8 + 64=72. So 72=72. So n=72 works. So that's another solution.\n\nWait, so n=72 is a solution. Let me verify. The smallest divisor of 72 greater than 1 is 2. Then m must be a divisor of 72 such that 72=2³ + m³. m³=72-8=64. m=4. 4 divides 72. Yes. So n=72 is a solution.\n\nSimilarly, let's check k=3. Then n=8*(1 +27)=8*28=224. Then m³=224 -8=216. m=6. Check if 6 divides 224. 224/6=37.333... No. So m=6 does not divide 224. Therefore, n=224 is not a solution.\n\nSo k=1 gives n=16, k=2 gives n=72. Let's see k=4: n=8*(1 +64)=8*65=520. m³=520 -8=512. m=8. Check if 8 divides 520. 520/8=65. Yes. So m=8. Then n=8 + 512=520. So n=520 is a solution.\n\nWait, so this seems like a pattern. For each k, n=8*(1 +k³), and m=2k. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor k=1: n=8*(1 +1)=16, m=2*1=2. 2 divides 16. Yes.\n\nFor k=2: n=8*(1 +8)=72, m=2*2=4. 4 divides 72. Yes.\n\nWait, but in the case of k=3: n=8*(1 +27)=224, m=2*3=6. But 6 doesn't divide 224. So the pattern breaks here. So maybe not for all k. Let's check why.\n\nWait, if m=2k, then m must divide n=8*(1 +k³). So 2k divides 8*(1 +k³). Simplify: 2k divides 8*(1 +k³). Divide both sides by 2: k divides 4*(1 +k³). So k divides 4*(1 +k³). Which implies that k divides 4*1 + 4*k³. Which is 4 + 4k³. Since k divides 4k³, then k must divide 4. So k divides 4. Therefore, possible k=1,2,4.\n\nWait, let's check k=4: n=8*(1 +64)=8*65=520. m=8. Check if 8 divides 520. 520/8=65. Yes. So m=8 divides 520. Then n=8 + 512=520. So n=520 works.\n\nBut if k=5: n=8*(1 +125)=8*126=1008. m=10. Check if 10 divides 1008. 1008/10=100.8. Not integer. So no. So the condition that k divides 4 is necessary. Therefore, only k=1,2,4. So n=16,72,520.\n\nWait, but let's check k=4. For k=4, n=520. So m=8. Then m³=512. 512 +8=520. Correct. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1,2,4, we get valid solutions. Let's check k=0. But k must be at least 1 because m must be at least d=2 (since d is the smallest divisor, which is 2 here). So m=2k, so k must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, for d=2, the solutions are n=8*(1 +k³) where k divides 4. So k=1,2,4. Therefore, n=16,72,520.\n\nWait, but let's check k=4. n=520. Let's confirm:\n\nn=520. The smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2. So d=2. Then m must be a divisor of 520 such that 520=8 + m³. m³=520 -8=512. m=8. 8 divides 520. Yes, 520/8=65. So yes, m=8. Therefore, n=520 is a solution.\n\nSo that gives three solutions for d=2: n=16,72,520.\n\nNow, let's check if there are solutions with d>2. Suppose d is an odd prime. Let's take d=3. Then n=3³ + m³=27 + m³. m must divide n. So m divides 27 + m³. Let's denote m as a divisor of n=27 + m³. So m divides 27 + m³. Which implies m divides 27. Because m divides m³, so m divides (27 + m³) - m²*m =27. Therefore, m must be a divisor of 27. So possible m=1,3,9,27. But m must be a positive divisor", "answer": "16, 72, 520"}

I need to find the minimal possible value of M(x, y), which is defined as the maximum of three expressions: xy, (x - 1)(y - 1), and x + y - 2xy. All x and y are real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive. Hmm, so I have to minimize the maximum of these three functions over the unit square [0,1]x[0,1]. \n\nFirst, maybe I should understand each of these three functions separately. Let's write them down:\n\n1. f1(x, y) = xy\n2. f2(x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1) = (1 - x)(1 - y)\n3. f3(x, y) = x + y - 2xy\n\nI need to find the smallest possible value of the maximum of these three. So essentially, I need to find x and y in [0,1]x[0,1] such that the largest among these three is as small as possible.\n\nLet me try to visualize each function.\n\nFor f1(x, y) = xy: This is the product of x and y, which is zero when either x or y is zero, and maximized at x=y=1 with value 1. But since we are dealing with the maximum of all three, maybe this function doesn't play a role except near the corners?\n\nFor f2(x, y) = (1 - x)(1 - y): This is similar to f1 but flipped. It's 1 when x and y are 0, and 0 when either x or y is 1. So it's a function that peaks at the origin and decreases towards the edges.\n\nFor f3(x, y) = x + y - 2xy: Let me see. Let's rearrange this: x + y - 2xy = x(1 - 2y) + y. Hmm, depending on the value of y, this can be increasing or decreasing. Let's compute its partial derivatives to see critical points.\n\nBut maybe before calculus, let me check the corners of the square [0,1]x[0,1], since maxima often occur there or on the edges.\n\nThe corners are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nAt (0,0): f1=0, f2=1, f3=0. So M=1.\n\nAt (0,1): f1=0, f2=0, f3=0 + 1 - 0 =1. So M=1.\n\nAt (1,0): Similarly, f1=0, f2=0, f3=1 + 0 -0=1. M=1.\n\nAt (1,1): f1=1, f2=(0)(0)=0, f3=1 +1 -2*1*1=0. So M=1.\n\nSo at all four corners, M(x,y)=1. So the maximum is 1 there. But maybe somewhere inside the square, the maximum is lower. The problem is to find the minimal possible value of M(x,y).\n\nSo perhaps the minimal value is less than 1, achieved somewhere inside the square. Let's check the edges.\n\nFirst, check the edges where x=0 or y=0.\n\nIf x=0, then f1=0, f2=(0 -1)(y -1)= ( -1 )(y -1 )=1 - y, and f3=0 + y - 0= y. So M(0,y) = max{0, 1 - y, y}. The maximum of 1 - y and y is minimized when y=0.5, giving M=0.5. So on the x=0 edge, the minimal M is 0.5 at y=0.5.\n\nSimilarly, on the y=0 edge, by symmetry, the minimal M is also 0.5 at x=0.5.\n\nNow check the edges where x=1 or y=1.\n\nIf x=1, then f1=y, f2=(1 -1)(y -1)=0, f3=1 + y - 2*1*y=1 + y - 2y=1 - y. So M(1,y)= max{y, 0, 1 - y}. The maximum of y and 1 - y is minimized at y=0.5, which gives M=0.5. Similarly on y=1 edge.\n\nSo on all edges, the minimal M is 0.5. So maybe the minimal value is 0.5? But wait, we need to check if there are points inside the square where M(x,y) is less than 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is achieved at some interior point where all three functions are balanced, such that none of them exceeds a certain value, and that value is the minimal possible.\n\nSo let's suppose that at the optimal point, all three functions are equal. If that's possible, then the maximum of them would be equal to each, so solving for when f1 = f2 = f3.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\n1. xy = (1 - x)(1 - y)\n2. xy = x + y - 2xy\n\nSo first equation: xy = (1 - x)(1 - y). Let's expand the right-hand side: 1 - x - y + xy. So:\n\nxy = 1 - x - y + xy\n\nSubtract xy from both sides:\n\n0 = 1 - x - y\n\nThus, 1 - x - y = 0 => x + y = 1.\n\nSecond equation: xy = x + y - 2xy. Let's substitute x + y =1 from the first equation into this.\n\nSo, xy = 1 - 2xy => 3xy =1 => xy =1/3.\n\nBut since x + y =1 and xy=1/3, we can solve for x and y.\n\nWe have x + y =1 and xy=1/3.\n\nThe solutions to this system are the roots of t^2 - t +1/3=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 - 4*(1/3) =1 -4/3= -1/3. So discriminant is negative, which implies that there are no real solutions. Therefore, the system of equations f1=f2=f3 has no real solutions. So there is no point inside the square where all three functions are equal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal M might be achieved where two of the functions intersect, and the third is less than or equal to them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal M is achieved along a line where two functions are equal and the third is less.\n\nSo let's check when two functions are equal and see where the third is smaller.\n\nCase 1: f1 = f2, and f3 <= f1.\n\nSo xy = (1 - x)(1 - y) and x + y -2xy <= xy.\n\nFrom the first equation, as before, x + y =1. Then substitute into the second inequality:\n\nx + y -2xy <= xy =>1 -2xy <= xy =>1 <=3xy =>xy >=1/3.\n\nBut since x + y =1, we can write this as xy >=1/3. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nGiven x + y =1, the maximum of xy is (1/2)^2 =1/4, achieved at x=y=1/2. So xy <=1/4. But we need xy >=1/3. But 1/3 >1/4, so this is impossible. Therefore, there is no point where f1=f2 and f3 <=f1.\n\nCase 2: f1 = f3, and f2 <= f1.\n\nSet xy =x + y -2xy =>3xy =x + y.\n\nAlso, (1 -x)(1 - y) <= xy.\n\nSo we have 3xy =x + y, and (1 -x)(1 - y) <= xy.\n\nLet me express x + y =3xy. Let's let S =x + y =3xy.\n\nWe can write x + y =3xy. Let me see if we can express this in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y.\n\nFrom x + y =3xy => y(1 -3x) = -x => y = -x/(1 -3x).\n\nBut since x and y are in [0,1], let's see when this is possible.\n\nThe denominator is 1 -3x. So 1 -3x must not be zero, so x ≠1/3. Also, since x is in [0,1], denominator is positive when x <1/3, and negative when x >1/3.\n\nBut y must be in [0,1]. Let's check for x in [0,1/3) and (1/3,1].\n\nIf x <1/3, then denominator 1 -3x >0. Then y = -x/(1 -3x). Since x is positive, y is negative, which is not allowed (y >=0). So no solution here.\n\nIf x >1/3, then denominator 1 -3x <0. Then y = -x/(negative) = positive. So y is positive. Let's see x in (1/3,1].\n\nBut x must be <=1. So x in (1/3,1].\n\nCompute y = -x/(1 -3x) = x/(3x -1).\n\nWe need y <=1. So x/(3x -1) <=1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (3x -1). But 3x -1 >0 since x >1/3. So inequality remains:\n\nx <=3x -1 => -2x <= -1 =>2x >=1 =>x >=1/2.\n\nSo x must be in [1/2,1]. Then y =x/(3x -1). Let's check for x in [1/2,1].\n\nAt x=1/2: y=(1/2)/(3*(1/2)-1)= (1/2)/(1.5 -1)= (1/2)/(0.5)=1. So y=1. But y=1 is allowed. So (x,y)=(1/2,1). But check if this satisfies (1 -x)(1 - y) <=xy.\n\nCompute (1 -0.5)(1 -1)=0.5*0=0 <=0.5*1=0.5. Yes, 0 <=0.5. So that's okay.\n\nBut at x=1/2, y=1. Let's check the other equations. f1=0.5*1=0.5, f2=(0.5)(0)=0, f3=0.5 +1 -2*0.5*1=0.5 +1 -1=0.5. So M(x,y)=0.5. So this point gives M=0.5. But wait, but x=1/2 and y=1 is on the edge, which we already checked earlier. So perhaps the minimal M is 0.5. But let's check if there are other points where two functions are equal and the third is less.\n\nCase 3: f2 = f3, and f1 <= f2.\n\nSet (1 -x)(1 - y)=x + y -2xy, and xy <=(1 -x)(1 - y).\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:1 -x -y +xy.\n\nSo equation:1 -x -y +xy =x + y -2xy.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1 -x -y +xy -x -y +2xy=0 =>1 -2x -2y +3xy=0.\n\nSo 3xy -2x -2y +1=0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's see if we can find solutions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the equation:\n\n3xy -2x -2y +1=0.\n\nLet me add 4/3 to both sides to complete some terms:\n\n3xy -2x -2y +1 +4/3=4/3.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set u =x, v=y.\n\nWait, perhaps factor:\n\n3xy -2x -2y +1=0.\n\nLet me see:\n\n3xy -2x -2y = -1.\n\nAdd 4/3 to both sides:\n\n3xy -2x -2y +4/3= -1 +4/3=1/3.\n\nNot helpful. Alternatively, rearrange terms:\n\n3xy =2x +2y -1.\n\nHmm. Let's see if we can express this as:\n\n3xy -2x -2y = -1.\n\nMaybe factor:\n\nx(3y -2) -2y = -1.\n\nSo x(3y -2) =2y -1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx=(2y -1)/(3y -2).\n\nNow, x must be in [0,1], y in [0,1]. Let's see for which y this is possible.\n\nFirst, denominator 3y -2. Let's check when denominator is zero: 3y -2=0 =>y=2/3. So y ≠2/3.\n\nFor y <2/3, denominator is negative (since 3y -2 <0). For y >2/3, denominator is positive.\n\nNumerator:2y -1. For y >=0.5, numerator is non-negative. For y <0.5, numerator is negative.\n\nSo, let's split into cases.\n\nCase A: y >=0.5, y ≠2/3.\n\nThen denominator 3y -2 >0, numerator 2y -1 >=0. So x=(2y -1)/(3y -2).\n\nWe need x in [0,1]. Let's check.\n\nSince y >=0.5 and y ≠2/3.\n\nCompute x=(2y -1)/(3y -2). Let's check when x <=1:\n\n(2y -1)/(3y -2) <=1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (3y -2). Since y >2/3, 3y -2 >0, so inequality remains:\n\n2y -1 <=3y -2.\n\nSubtract 2y: -1 <= y -2.\n\nAdd 2:1 <= y.\n\nBut y <=1, so equality at y=1. So for y in [0.5,1], x=(2y -1)/(3y -2).\n\nAt y=1: x=(2 -1)/(3 -2)=1/1=1.\n\nAt y=0.5: x=(1 -1)/(1.5 -2)=0/(-0.5)=0. So x=0 when y=0.5.\n\nWait, but when y=0.5, denominator is 3*(0.5)-2=1.5 -2=-0.5. Wait, but earlier we had y >=0.5, but for y=0.5, denominator", "answer": "\\frac{4}{9}"}

Determine the largest positive integer \\( k \\) with the property that in every such sequence of 1000 distinct numbers, there are at least \\( k \\) non-overlapping ascending pairs or at least \\( k \\) non-overlapping descending pairs.\n\nThe problem is asking for the largest \\( k \\) such that in any permutation of 1000 distinct numbers, there exist at least \\( k \\) non-overlapping ascending pairs or at least \\( k \\) non-overlapping descending pairs. Non-overlapping pairs are those where the indices \\( i < j < k < l \\) do not share any common indices.\n\nThis problem relates to the concept of non-crossing or non-overlapping monotonic subsequences in permutations. The goal is to determine the maximum \\( k \\) such that every permutation of length 1000 must contain at least \\( k \\) non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs.\n\nTo approach this, consider the following:\n1. **Understanding Non-Overlapping Pairs**: Non-overlapping pairs must have indices that do not share any common elements. For example, if you have a pair \\( (a_1, a_3) \\), the next pair must be \\( (a_4, a_5) \\) or later.\n2. **Permutation Structure**: Any permutation of 1000 elements can be decomposed into such non-overlapping pairs. The question is about the minimum number of such pairs guaranteed in any permutation.\n3. **Known Results**: This problem might be related to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, which deals with the existence of monotonic subsequences in permutations. However, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem typically considers subsequences that can overlap, whereas here we need non-overlapping ones.\n\nThe Erdős–Szekeres theorem states that any sequence of more than \\( (r-1)(s-1) \\) elements contains an increasing subsequence of length \\( r \\) or a decreasing subsequence of length \\( s \\). For our problem, we are looking for pairs, so \\( r = 2 \\) and \\( s = 2 \\), which would imply that any sequence longer than \\( (1)(1) = 1 \\) (i.e., longer than 1 element) contains an increasing or decreasing subsequence of length 2. However, this is trivial since any two elements form a pair.\n\nBut we need the non-overlapping condition, which complicates things. The key difference is that the Erdős–Szekeres theorem allows overlapping subsequences, while our problem requires non-overlapping pairs. Therefore, the results might be different.\n\nConsidering the problem's requirement for non-overlapping pairs, we need to ensure that we can find \\( k \\) such pairs that do not share any indices. Each pair uses two indices, so the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs in a sequence of length \\( n \\) is \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\). However, this is the theoretical maximum, and the question is about the minimum guaranteed \\( k \\).\n\nTo find the largest \\( k \\), we need to determine the minimal number of non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs that must exist in any permutation of 1000 elements. This is equivalent to covering the permutation with as few non-overlapping pairs as possible, and finding the lower bound for this minimal number.\n\nOne approach to this is to consider the concept of \"crossing\" pairs and how they can be arranged. However, since we need non-overlapping pairs, the structure of the permutation will influence how many such pairs can be found.\n\nA possible strategy is to partition the permutation into blocks where each block can contribute at most one non-overlapping pair. For example, if we divide the permutation into blocks of size 3, each block can contain at most one non-overlapping ascending or descending pair. However, this might not be the optimal partition.\n\nAlternatively, consider dividing the permutation into alternating sections where each section is increasing or decreasing. If we can ensure a certain number of such sections, we can derive the number of non-overlapping pairs.\n\nAnother angle is to use the concept of \"alternating permutations\". An alternating permutation is one that alternately increases and decreases, such as \"up-down-up-down...\". The length of the longest alternating subsequence in a random permutation is known to be on the order of \\( 2n/3 \\), but again, this is for overlapping subsequences.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this problem by considering the permutation as a sequence of ascents and descents. An ascent is a position \\( i \\) where \\( a_i < a_{i+1} \\), and a descent is where \\( a_i > a_{i+1} \\). The number of ascents and descents in a permutation can vary, but in any case, the total number of ascents and descents is \\( n - 1 \\) for a permutation of length \\( n \\).\n\nHowever, the problem is about pairs, not individual ascents or descents. Each pair is an ascent or descent between two elements. Non-overlapping pairs would require that their corresponding ascents or descents do not overlap in indices.\n\nFor example, if we have an ascent from \\( a_1 \\) to \\( a_2 \\), the next possible non-overlapping ascent or descent must start at \\( a_3 \\) or later.\n\nTo maximize the number of non-overlapping pairs, we can alternate between increasing and decreasing pairs. However, in the worst-case permutation, this alternation might be minimized.\n\nWait, but we need the minimal number of non-overlapping pairs across all permutations. Therefore, we need to find the permutation that minimizes the number of non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs, and then determine the maximum \\( k \\) such that even in that permutation, there are at least \\( k \\) such pairs.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs in a permutation of 1000 elements, and then taking that as \\( k \\).\n\nTo find such a permutation, we can consider a permutation that is constructed to have as few non-overlapping pairs as possible. For example, a permutation that alternates between increasing and decreasing pairs in a way that maximizes overlap.\n\nHowever, constructing such a permutation might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of \"decomposing\" the permutation into such pairs.\n\nAnother approach is to use induction. For a permutation of length \\( n \\), the minimal number of non-overlapping pairs is \\( \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\). But this is not necessarily the case. For example, in a sorted permutation, all pairs are ascending, but they can be non-overlapping. However, in a completely reversed permutation, all pairs are descending, but again, they can be non-overlapping. Wait, but in a sorted permutation, you can only have 500 non-overlapping pairs (since each pair uses two elements), but actually, in a sorted permutation, any pair is ascending, but you can select every other element to form non-overlapping pairs. For example, in the sorted permutation \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 1000 \\), the pairs \\( (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), \\ldots \\) are all ascending and non-overlapping, totaling 500 pairs. Similarly, in the reversed permutation \\( 1000, 999, \\ldots, 1 \\), the pairs \\( (1000, 999), (998, 997), \\ldots \\) are all descending and non-overlapping, also totaling 500 pairs.\n\nHowever, the question is about the minimal number across all permutations. So, is there a permutation where the number of non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs is significantly less than 500?\n\nSuppose we construct a permutation that is a concatenation of small increasing or decreasing blocks. For example, consider a permutation that alternates between increasing and decreasing blocks of size 2. Wait, but a block of size 2 is just a pair. If we have blocks of size 2, alternating between increasing and decreasing, then in such a permutation, there are no non-overlapping pairs because each block is adjacent. However, in this case, each element is part of a block, so there are no non-overlapping pairs. But this is impossible because the permutation must consist of distinct numbers. If we have blocks of size 2, alternating between increasing and decreasing, but with distinct numbers, then the permutation would look like \\( (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), \\ldots \\) which is increasing, or \\( (1,2), (4,3), (5,6), \\ldots \\), which alternates increasing and decreasing. In the latter case, the pairs \\( (1,2) \\) and \\( (4,3) \\) are non-overlapping and can be either ascending or descending. However, in this case, there are 500 pairs, but they alternate between ascending and descending. Therefore, the number of non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs would still be 500, as each pair is either ascending or descending.\n\nWait, but if we arrange the permutation in such a way that most pairs are overlapping. For example, a permutation that is a single long alternating sequence. For example, \\( 1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998, \\ldots \\). In this permutation, every adjacent pair is either ascending or descending. Specifically, \\( (1, 1000) \\) is descending, \\( (1000, 2) \\) is ascending, \\( (2, 999) \\) is descending, etc. In this case, the non-overlapping pairs would be pairs that are separated by at least one element. For example, \\( (1, 1000) \\) and \\( (2, 999) \\) are non-overlapping, but \\( (1, 1000) \\) and \\( (1000, 2) \\) are overlapping. So, in this permutation, how many non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs can we find?\n\nEach ascending or descending pair must be separated by at least one element. So, for example, if we take every other pair, we can get non-overlapping pairs. In the permutation \\( 1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998, \\ldots \\), the ascending pairs are \\( (2, 999), (4, 998), \\ldots \\) and the descending pairs are \\( (1, 1000), (3, 998), \\ldots \\). If we want to find non-overlapping ascending or descending pairs, we might need to select pairs that are spaced out.\n\nHowever, in this permutation, the ascending pairs are of the form \\( (2i, 1001 - 2i) \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots \\), and descending pairs are \\( (1001 - 2i, 2i - 1) \\). To find non-overlapping pairs, we need to choose pairs that do not share any elements. For example, selecting \\( (1, 1000) \\), then the next available pair would be \\( (2, 999) \\), then \\( (3, 998) \\), etc. However, in this case, each selected pair removes two elements from the permutation, reducing the remaining elements. But since the permutation is of length 1000, selecting \\( k \\) non-overlapping pairs would require \\( 2k \\) elements.\n\nBut in the alternating permutation described, every other element is part of an ascending or descending pair. For example, in the permutation \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_{1000} \\), the pairs \\( (a_1, a_2) \\), \\( (a_3, a_4) \\), \\( (a_5, a_6) \\), etc., alternate between descending and ascending. However, these pairs are overlapping (adjacent), so they can't be non-overlapping. Therefore, to find non-overlapping pairs, we need to skip at least one element between each selected pair.\n\nSuppose we select every second pair. For example, select \\( (a_1, a_2) \\), then the next available pair is \\( (a_4, a_5) \\), then \\( (a_7, a_8) \\), etc. In this case, each selected pair is separated by one pair. However, in the alternating permutation, \\( (a_4, a_5) \\) would be ascending or descending depending on the structure. In the specific alternating permutation \\( 1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998, \\ldots \\), the pairs \\( (a_1, a_2) = (1, 1000) \\) descending, \\( (a_3, a_4) = (2, 999) \\) ascending, \\( (a_5, a_6) = (3, 998) \\) descending, etc. So the selected pairs \\( (1, 1000) \\), \\( (2, 999) \\), \\( (3, 998) \\), etc., are all descending or ascending alternately. However, these pairs are non-overlapping if we select every other pair.\n\nWait, if we select \\( (1, 1000) \\), then the next non-overlapping pair would be \\( (2, 999) \\), which starts at index 2. But \\( (1, 1000) \\) ends at index 2, so they overlap. Therefore, we cannot select both. Instead, to have non-overlapping pairs, the next pair must start after the end of the previous one. So if we select \\( (1, 1000) \\), the next pair must start at index 3. In the permutation \\( 1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998, \\ldots \\), the pair starting at index 3 is \\( (2, 999) \\), which is ascending. But \\( (1, 1000) \\) and \\( (2, 999) \\) are overlapping at index 2. Therefore, actually, it's impossible to select non-overlapping pairs in this permutation if we follow the structure. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the permutation \\( 1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998, \\ldots \\), the pairs are:\n\n- \\( (1, 1", "answer": "333"}

Hmm, primes, so both p and q are primes. Let me start by understanding what the equation is saying.\n\nFirst, let's write it out again to make sure I have it right:\n\np(p² - p - 1) = q(2q + 3)\n\nSo, on the left side, we have a cubic expression in p, and on the right side, a quadratic expression in q. Since p and q are primes, they are positive integers greater than or equal to 2. Maybe I can try plugging in small prime numbers for p and see if the equation results in q being a prime as well. If that works, then that pair (p, q) is a solution.\n\nLet me start with the smallest primes. Let's try p = 2 first.\n\nIf p = 2:\n\nLeft side: 2*(2² - 2 - 1) = 2*(4 - 2 - 1) = 2*(1) = 2\n\nSo, left side is 2. Then the right side should be 2, so:\n\n2 = q*(2q + 3)\n\nSo, 2q² + 3q - 2 = 0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation for q. The quadratic formula is q = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = 2, b = 3, c = -2.\n\nDiscriminant: 9 - 4*2*(-2) = 9 + 16 = 25\n\nSo, q = [-3 ± 5]/4\n\nSo, possible solutions:\n\nq = (-3 + 5)/4 = 2/4 = 0.5\n\nq = (-3 - 5)/4 = -8/4 = -2\n\nBut q has to be a prime, so positive integer. 0.5 and -2 are not primes. Therefore, p = 2 does not yield a valid prime q. So, p = 2 is not a solution.\n\nNext, try p = 3.\n\nLeft side: 3*(3² - 3 -1) = 3*(9 - 3 -1) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nSo, right side: q*(2q + 3) = 15\n\nSo, 2q² + 3q - 15 = 0\n\nAgain, using quadratic formula:\n\na = 2, b = 3, c = -15\n\nDiscriminant: 9 - 4*2*(-15) = 9 + 120 = 129\n\nsqrt(129) is approximately 11.357, which is not an integer. So, q would not be an integer here. Therefore, no integer solution for q. So, p = 3 is not a solution.\n\nNext prime, p = 5.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,... So after 3 comes 5.\n\nWait, let me check p = 5.\n\nLeft side: 5*(5² -5 -1) = 5*(25 -5 -1) = 5*(19) = 95\n\nSo, right side: q*(2q + 3) = 95\n\nSo, 2q² + 3q - 95 = 0\n\nAgain, quadratic equation:\n\na = 2, b = 3, c = -95\n\nDiscriminant: 9 - 4*2*(-95) = 9 + 760 = 769\n\nsqrt(769) ≈ 27.73, which is not an integer. So, q is not an integer here either. So, p = 5 is out.\n\nNext prime, p = 7.\n\nLeft side: 7*(7² -7 -1) = 7*(49 -7 -1) = 7*(41) = 287\n\nRight side: 2q² + 3q - 287 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: 9 + 4*2*287 = 9 + 2296 = 2305\n\nsqrt(2305) ≈ 48.01, which is not an integer. So, no integer q here.\n\np = 11?\n\nLeft side: 11*(121 -11 -1) = 11*(109) = 1199\n\nRight side: 2q² + 3q - 1199 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: 9 + 4*2*1199 = 9 + 9592 = 9601\n\nWait, sqrt(9601) is 98, because 98² = 9604. Hmm, wait, 98² is 9604, so 9601 is 98² - 3. So, sqrt(9601) is not an integer. So, no solution here.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be efficient. Trying primes one by one might take a long time. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\np(p² - p -1) = q(2q + 3)\n\nLet me denote the left side as L(p) and the right side as R(q). Since p and q are primes, and primes are at least 2, maybe we can find bounds on p and q.\n\nFirst, note that p and q are positive integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nSo, let's consider the growth rates of L(p) and R(q). L(p) is a cubic function in p, while R(q) is a quadratic function in q. So, as p increases, L(p) grows much faster than R(q). Therefore, there might be only a limited number of primes p where L(p) is equal to R(q) for some prime q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can bound p and q. Let's see.\n\nSuppose p is a prime. Then L(p) = p³ - p² - p. And R(q) = 2q² + 3q.\n\nWe need p³ - p² - p = 2q² + 3q.\n\nSince primes are at least 2, let's see for small primes, but as we saw, p=2,3,5,7,11 don't work. Maybe try larger primes?\n\nWait, but if p is large, then L(p) is roughly p³, so R(q) would need to be approximately p³. Since R(q) is 2q², then q would need to be roughly sqrt(p³ / 2). So, q is roughly proportional to p^(3/2). But since q has to be a prime, and p is a prime, perhaps there's a relation here. However, primes grow roughly linearly with their size, but the square of a prime is quadratic, so maybe this is not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the equation modulo some small primes to find constraints on p and q.\n\nFor example, let's consider the equation modulo 3. Maybe that can help eliminate some possibilities.\n\nFirst, modulo 3.\n\nCompute L(p) mod 3 and R(q) mod 3.\n\nLet's compute L(p) = p³ - p² - p mod 3.\n\nBy Fermat's little theorem, for any integer p not divisible by 3, p³ ≡ p mod 3. So, p³ - p² - p ≡ p - p² - p mod 3 = -p² mod 3.\n\nSimilarly, R(q) = 2q² + 3q ≡ 2q² mod 3.\n\nSo, the equation mod 3 becomes:\n\n-p² ≡ 2q² mod 3\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\np² ≡ -2q² mod 3\n\nBut -2 ≡ 1 mod 3, so p² ≡ q² mod 3.\n\nTherefore, p² - q² ≡ 0 mod 3 => (p - q)(p + q) ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, either p ≡ q mod 3 or p ≡ -q mod 3.\n\nBut since p and q are primes, unless they are 3, they are not divisible by 3. So, if p ≠ 3 and q ≠ 3, then p ≡ ±1 mod 3 and q ≡ ±1 mod 3. So, their squares would be 1 mod 3. Therefore, if p and q are not 3, then p² ≡ q² ≡ 1 mod 3, so the equation would hold. But if one of them is 3, then we need to check.\n\nSo, possibilities:\n\nCase 1: p = 3. Then check if q can be a prime.\n\nCase 2: q = 3. Check if p can be a prime.\n\nCase 3: p ≡ q mod 3 or p ≡ -q mod 3, with p and q not 3.\n\nSo, let's check each case.\n\nFirst, check p = 3.\n\nIf p = 3:\n\nLeft side: 3*(9 - 3 -1) = 3*5 = 15\n\nSo, 15 = q(2q + 3)\n\nSo, 2q² + 3q -15 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation:\n\nq = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 120)]/4 = [-3 ± sqrt(129)]/4\n\nsqrt(129) is not an integer, so q is not an integer. Therefore, p=3 is not a solution.\n\nNext, check q=3.\n\nIf q=3:\n\nRight side: 3*(6 + 3) = 3*9 =27\n\nLeft side: p(p² - p -1) =27\n\nSo, p³ - p² - p -27 =0\n\nWe need to find prime p such that p³ -p² -p =27.\n\nTry p=3: 27 -9 -3=15≠27.\n\np=2: 8 -4 -2=2≠27.\n\np=5:125 -25 -5=95≠27.\n\np=7:343 -49 -7=287≠27.\n\np=11:1331 -121 -11=1199≠27.\n\nSo, no solution here. So, q=3 is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are when either p or q is 3, but neither of those work. So, maybe p and q are both not 3, but then p ≡ q or p ≡ -q mod 3. Since primes greater than 3 are congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. So, if p ≡ q mod 3, then both are 1 or both are 2. If p ≡ -q mod 3, then one is 1 and the other is 2.\n\nBut given that p and q are primes, and their squares are 1 mod 3, so p² ≡ q² mod 3. Therefore, this condition is satisfied. So, modulo 3 doesn't give us any contradictions, but tells us that either they are both 3 or their squares are congruent mod 3, which is automatically true. So, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider modulo 4.\n\nPrimes can be 2 or odd. If p is 2, we saw that doesn't work. If p is odd, then p is 1 or 3 mod 4. Let's compute L(p) mod 4.\n\nIf p is odd (i.e., p ≡1 or 3 mod 4):\n\np² ≡1 mod4, so p³ ≡p mod4.\n\nTherefore, L(p) = p³ - p² - p ≡ p - 1 - p ≡ -1 mod4.\n\nSo, L(p) ≡ -1 mod4.\n\nOn the other hand, R(q) =2q² +3q. Let's compute this mod4.\n\nIf q is even (i.e., q=2):\n\nR(q) = 2*4 +3*2 =8 +6=14≡2 mod4.\n\nIf q is odd (i.e., q≡1 or3 mod4):\n\nq² ≡1 mod4, so R(q)=2*1 +3q ≡2 +3q mod4.\n\nIf q≡1 mod4: 2 +3*1=5≡1 mod4.\n\nIf q≡3 mod4:2 +3*3=2 +9=11≡3 mod4.\n\nSo, R(q) can be 2,1,3 mod4 depending on q.\n\nBut L(p) ≡ -1 ≡3 mod4. So, R(q) must ≡3 mod4. So, which q gives R(q)≡3 mod4?\n\nFrom above, when q≡3 mod4, R(q)≡3 mod4. So, q must be ≡3 mod4.\n\nTherefore, if p is odd (i.e., p≠2), then q must be ≡3 mod4.\n\nBut q is a prime. So, primes congruent to 3 mod4 are primes like 3,7,11, etc. So, q=3,7,11,etc.\n\nBut q must be prime. So, if p is odd, then q must be 3 mod4. But q can be 3, which is 3 mod4. So, q=3 is allowed. Let me check q=3 again, but we saw that when q=3, p=3 didn't work. Wait, but if p is odd, then q must be 3 mod4. So, maybe q=3 is possible? Let's check.\n\nWait, q=3: 3 is 3 mod4, so that would satisfy the modulo 4 condition. So, maybe q=3 is a candidate. But when we tried q=3, we saw that the equation gives p³ -p² -p =27. Which didn't yield a prime p. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the modulo 4 condition only tells us that if p is odd, q must be 3 mod4. So, primes q=3,7,11, etc. So, maybe q=7? Let's try q=7.\n\nRight side:7*(14 +3)=7*17=119\n\nSo, left side: p(p² -p -1)=119\n\nSo, p³ -p² -p -119=0", "answer": "(13, 31)"}

The board is covered completely by dominoes, meaning each domino covers exactly two squares, and they don't overlap or go out of the board. Also, mn is even, which makes sense because dominoes cover two squares each, so the total number of squares must be even. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. We have an m×n board, m rows and n columns. Each domino covers two squares. Since mn is even, the entire board can be tiled with dominoes. Then Merlijn colors each domino either red or blue. The goal is to find the smallest V such that, regardless of how Merlijn colors the dominoes, in every row, the difference between the number of red and blue dominoes is at most V. \n\nSo, V is the maximum difference over all rows for any possible coloring. We need the minimal such V. Hmm. \n\nLet me think of small cases first. Maybe start with a 1×2 board. That's the simplest case. Here, m=1, n=2. The board has two squares, covered by one domino. Merlijn colors this domino either red or blue. In the only row (which has 2 squares), the number of red and blue dominoes would be either 1 red and 0 blue or 0 red and 1 blue. Wait, but a domino covers two squares. So in the 1×2 board, the single domino covers both squares. So in the single row, there's one domino. So the difference between red and blue dominoes in that row is either 1 or -1, which is a difference of 1. So V must be at least 1. But can we have a higher difference? No, because there's only one domino. So V=1. But wait, if the domino is colored red, then red is 1, blue is 0, difference 1. If blue, difference -1, absolute difference 1. So the maximum difference is 1. Therefore for 1×2, V=1. \n\nBut maybe the problem is more interesting for larger boards. Let's consider 2×2. In a 2×2 board, there are two dominoes. Depending on the tiling, dominoes can be placed horizontally or vertically. But since the board is 2x2, any domino tiling is two dominoes either horizontal or vertical. Wait, actually, the 2x2 board can only be tiled in two ways: two horizontal dominoes or two vertical dominoes. Wait, no, actually, there are two possible tilings. For example, either two horizontal dominoes (each covering two squares in a row) or two vertical dominoes (each covering two squares in a column). So depending on the tiling, the dominoes are arranged horizontally or vertically. \n\nBut in this problem, the tiling is fixed. The board is given, and we have to consider all possible tilings. Wait, no, the problem says \"a m×n-board... bedekken met dominosen\". So first, the board is tiled with dominoes (so a specific tiling is given). Then Merlijn colors the dominoes. Wait, wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\n\"Merlijn Goes Vertolzes alle dominetenen op het Bord Rook of Blauw Koloreren. Bepaal alle N smallest Non-Negative Gehele Getal V (afhankelijk van m en n) zodat Merlijn Er Aansch rekent dat in elke Rij het Aantal Vakjes Bedekt Doet Door een Rude Dominstenen en Hede Vakjes Bedekt Doet Door een Blauwe Dominstenen ten Highesteech Van elkaar Artemde, Hoe Jetze het Bord Bbmii Kedicine Krijt.\"\n\nWait, maybe the translation is slightly off, but the key is: regardless of how the board is tiled (i.e., for any possible tiling), and regardless of how Merlijn colors the dominoes (either red or blue), the difference in each row between red and blue dominoes is at most V. Wait, no, actually, perhaps it's that for any tiling, and for any coloring, the difference in each row is at most V. So V needs to be such that no matter how you tile the board and color the dominoes, every row has the difference between red and blue dominoes capped by V.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"Bepaal alle N smallest Non-Negative Gehele Getal V (afhankelijk van m en n) zodat Merlijn Er Aansch rekent dat in elke Rij het Aantal Vakjes Bedekt Doet Door een Rude Dominstenen en Hede Vakjes Bedekt Doet Door een Blauwe Dominstenen ten Highesteech Van elkaar Artemde, Hoejet zet het Bord Bbmii K-State Krijt.\"\n\nHmm, the translation is a bit unclear. Maybe it's better to parse the original Dutch. But given that the problem is about a board that is always tiled with dominoes, and then Merlijn colors the dominoes, and we need the minimal V such that for any tiling and any coloring, every row has the difference between red and blue dominoes at most V. So V is the maximum over all rows, and we need the minimal such V that works for all tilings and colorings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the board is fixed with a tiling, and then Merlijn can choose the coloring. Then V is the maximum difference over rows for that fixed tiling. But the problem says \"hohow jetze het Bord Bbmii K-State Krijt\", which might mean \"how does Merlijn set the board\". Hmm, maybe the board is fixed, and Merlijn can color the dominoes. Then V is the maximum difference over all possible colorings for that fixed tiling. But the problem says \"in elke Rij\" which is \"in every row\", so regardless of the tiling? Wait, no, the problem says \"in elke Rij\" meaning \"in every row\", but the tilings are part of the problem. Wait, perhaps it's for any tiling and any coloring. So V is the minimal number such that for any tiling and any coloring, every row has difference <= V. So V is the maximum over all tilings and colorings of the maximum row difference, and we need the minimal such V.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimal V such that for every tiling, and every coloring, the maximum row difference is <= V. So we need to find the minimal V where, no matter how you tile the board and color the dominoes, each row's difference is at most V. Therefore, V is the maximum, over all tilings and colorings, of the maximum row difference. So we need to find the minimal possible maximum over all tilings and colorings, such that for every tiling and coloring, the maximum row difference is <= V. So V is the minimal maximum difference that is unavoidable, regardless of tiling and coloring.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Bepaal alle N smallest Non-Negative Gehele Getal V (afhankelijk van m en n) zodat Merlijn Er Aansch rekent dat in elke Rij het Aantal Vakoes Bedekt Doet Door een Rude Dominstenen en Hede Vakoes Bedekt Doet Door een Blauwe Dominstenen ten Highesteech Van elkaar Artemde, Hoejet zet het Bord Bbmii K-State Krijt.\"\n\nTranslating more accurately: \"Determine the smallest non-negative integers V (depending on m and n) such that Merlijn can ensure that in every row, the number of squares covered by a red domino and the number of squares covered by a blue domino differ by at most V, regardless of how the board is tiled and colored.\"\n\nSo, regardless of the tiling and the coloring, the difference in each row between red and blue dominoes is at most V. And we need the minimal such V.\n\nTherefore, V is the maximum, over all possible tilings and colorings, of the maximum row difference. So we need to find the minimal V such that for every tiling and every coloring, all rows have difference <= V.\n\nSo the question is, for an m×n board, what is the smallest possible V where no matter how you tile the board with dominoes and color them red or blue, the difference in each row between red and blue dominoes is at most V.\n\nSo, to find V, we need to analyze for any tiling and coloring, the maximum difference in any row, and find the minimal such V across all possible tilings.\n\nTherefore, V is the minimal number such that for all tilings and colorings, the maximum row difference is <= V. So we need to find the maximum over all tilings of the minimal possible maximum row difference over all colorings. Wait, no. Wait, actually, for each tiling, Merlijn can choose the coloring. So for each tiling, the maximum row difference can be minimized by choosing the best coloring. Then, V is the maximum over all tilings of the minimal maximum row difference (achieved by coloring) for that tiling. So we need to find the minimal V such that for every tiling, there exists a coloring where all rows have difference <= V. Then V is the maximum of these minimal values over all tilings. So V is the minimal number such that every tiling can be colored with dominoes such that in every row, the difference is at most V. Then, V is the maximum such minimal value over all tilings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around. For each tiling, you can choose a coloring that minimizes the maximum row difference. Then, the maximum of these minimal values over all tilings is V. So V is the maximum, over all tilings, of the minimal maximum row difference achievable by coloring that tiling. Therefore, to find V, we need to consider the worst-case tiling (the one that requires the largest minimal maximum row difference), and then V is equal to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way: for each tiling, find the minimal maximum row difference over all colorings, then take the maximum over all tilings. So V is equal to the maximum, over all tilings, of the minimal maximum row difference (over colorings). So for each tiling, we can find the best possible coloring (the one that minimizes the maximum row difference), and then take the maximum of these values over all tilings. That would be V.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible that for some tilings, no matter how you color the dominoes, certain rows will have a fixed difference. For example, in a checkerboard pattern, maybe the difference is fixed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a general formula for V based on m and n. Let me think.\n\nSince each domino covers two squares in a row or spans two rows. If a domino is horizontal, it covers two squares in the same row. If it's vertical, it covers one square in two different rows. Therefore, horizontal dominoes affect only one row each, while vertical dominoes affect two rows.\n\nTherefore, coloring a horizontal domino red or blue only affects the difference in that particular row. On the other hand, a vertical domino, when colored red or blue, affects both rows it covers. So if a vertical domino is red, both rows get +1 for red, and if blue, both get -1. Therefore, vertical dominoes can create a difference in both rows they cover. \n\nTherefore, if a tiling has vertical dominoes, coloring them can affect both rows. Conversely, horizontal dominoes only affect their own row. Therefore, in a tiling with many vertical dominoes, the coloring can balance the differences in two rows at once, whereas in a tiling with many horizontal dominoes, each domino can only affect one row. \n\nTherefore, if a tiling has more vertical dominoes, then it's possible to balance the differences in the rows. Conversely, if a tiling has more horizontal dominoes, each horizontal domino can create a difference in its own row, making it harder to balance.\n\nTherefore, thehyper board tilings with more horizontal dominoes would require a higher V, since each horizontal domino can independently create a difference in its row. However, if the tiling has vertical dominoes, we can use their coloring to balance both rows.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case tiling might be one with as many horizontal dominoes as possible, leading to higher V. But how many horizontal dominoes can a tiling have?\n\nIn an m×n board, the number of dominoes is mn/2. If we use as many horizontal dominoes as possible, then the number of horizontal dominoes is ceil(mn/2). Wait, no. Wait, if all dominoes are horizontal, then each row must have n squares, which must be divisible by 2. So if n is even, then each row can have n/2 horizontal dominoes, so total dominoes is m*(n/2). If n is odd, then you can't tile the board with all horizontal dominoes, since mn would have to be even. Wait, but the problem states that mn is even, so either m or n is even.\n\nWait, actually, if mn is even, then either m or n is even. So if, say, n is even, then you can tile the entire board with horizontal dominoes. If n is odd, then m must be even. So, for example, if n is even, then all dominoes can be horizontal. If n is odd, then m must be even, and you can tile the board with horizontal dominoes as well, since each row has n (odd) squares, but wait, n is odd, so each row has an odd number of squares, which can't be tiled with dominoes. Wait, hold on. Wait, mn is even. If n is odd, then m must be even. So m is even, n is odd. Then, each row has n (odd) squares, which can't be tiled with dominoes. Therefore, in such a case, the tiling must consist of vertical dominoes. Because vertical dominoes tile two rows at once, each covering one square in each of two rows. Since n is odd, each column has n squares, which is odd, so each column must have (n-1)/2 vertical dominoes and one square left? Wait, no. Wait, vertical dominoes cover two rows in each column. If n is odd, then in each column, you can't have vertical dominoes covering all n squares, since", "answer": "Stel eerst dat \\( n \\) oneven is. Dan is het duidelijk dat \\( V \\geq 1 \\); het verschil is immers altijd oneven. We laten zien dat \\( V = 1 \\) altijd mogelijk is. Kleur hiertoe de verticale dominostenen in oneven kolommen rood en de verticale dominostenen in even kolommen blauw. Omdat in elke rij elke horizontale dominosteen een vakje in een even en een vakje in een oneven kolom bedekt, is er nu in elke rij één vakje meer door een rode dominosteen dan door een blauwe dominosteen bedekt. Kleur de horizontale dominostenen in elke rij nu afwisselend blauw, rood, blauw, rood, ... . Als het aantal horizontale domino's oneven is, is er uiteindelijk één rood vakje meer; is het aantal horizontale domino’s even, dan is er uiteindelijk één blauw vakje meer. Het verschil is dus altijd 1.\n\nAls \\( n = 2 \\) mod 4 geldt er dat \\( V \\geq 2 \\) als Jetze die dominostenen horizontaal legt; dan liggen er in elke rij immers een oneven aantal dominostenen.

Bovendien is het aantal horizontale dominostenen in rij \\( k \\) nu even, dus we kleuren simpelweg de helft rood en de helft blauw. Als \\( b_{k-1} \\neq b_k \\equiv 2 \\mod 4 \\), geldt wederom dat de verticale dominostenen in rij \\( k \\) evenveel rode als blauwe vakjes bedekken, omdat er van \\( k-1 \\) en \\( k \\) één even en één oneven is. Verder is het aantal horizontale dominostenen in rij \\( k \\) weer even, dus kunnen we weer de helft rood en de helft blauw kleuren.\n\nAls \\( b_{k-1} \\neq b_k \\mod 4 \\), is het verschil tussen rode en blauwe vakjes bedekt door verticale dominostenen gelijk aan 2. Het aantal horizontale dominostenen in rij \\( k \\) is nu oneven.

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let's start by plugging in some specific values for x and y to see if I can get any useful information.\n\nFirst, maybe try setting x = 0. That often simplifies things. Let's see:\n\nIf x = 0, the equation becomes f(0 + yf(0 + y)) = y² + f(0)f(y). Simplifying, that's f(yf(y)) = y² + f(0)f(y). Hmm, interesting. So for any real y, f evaluated at y times f(y) gives y squared plus f(0) times f(y). Not sure what to do with that yet. Maybe if I can find f(0) somehow?\n\nLet's try setting y = 0. Then the original equation becomes f(x + 0*f(x + 0)) = 0² + f(x)f(0), which simplifies to f(x) = f(x)f(0). So for all x, either f(x) = 0 or f(0) = 1. Wait, that's a key point. So unless f(x) is identically zero, f(0) must be 1. Because for any x, either f(x) is zero (but then that x would have to satisfy f(0) can be anything, but if f(x) is zero for some x, then f(0) is 1? Wait, no, that conclusion might not hold. Let me think again.\n\nFrom f(x) = f(x)f(0) for all x. So if there exists an x where f(x) ≠ 0, then we can divide both sides by f(x) and get 1 = f(0). So f(0) must be 1. However, if f(x) = 0 for all x, then substituting back into the original equation, we get 0 = y² + 0*0 = y². But that's only true when y = 0, which isn't valid for all y. Wait, actually, if f is identically zero, then the left-hand side becomes f(x + y*0) = f(x) = 0, and the right-hand side becomes y² + 0*0 = y². So 0 = y² for all y, which is only true when y = 0. But the equation has to hold for all real x and y, so f(x) = 0 is not a solution unless we restrict y, but y can be any real number. Therefore, the zero function is not a solution. Therefore, the only possibility is that f(0) = 1.\n\nSo f(0) = 1. That's a start. Now, let's see if we can find more properties. Maybe set y = 1. Let's try y = 1. Then the original equation becomes f(x + 1*f(x + 1)) = 1² + f(x)f(1) = 1 + f(x)f(1). Hmm, not sure. Maybe set x = -y. Let's try x = -y. Then substituting into the equation: f(-y + yf(-y + y)) = y² + f(-y)f(y). Simplify the left side: f(-y + yf(0)) = y² + f(-y)f(y). Since f(0) = 1, this becomes f(-y + y*1) = f(0) = 1? Wait, no. Wait, f(-y + yf(0)) = f(-y + y*1) = f(-y + y) = f(0) = 1. So the left side is 1, and the right side is y² + f(-y)f(y). Therefore, 1 = y² + f(-y)f(y) for all y. So this gives us f(-y)f(y) = 1 - y². Interesting. That's a relation between f(-y) and f(y). Maybe we can use this later.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can find f is even or odd or something. Maybe set y = -y? Wait, perhaps not. Let's think. Also, we know that f(0) = 1. Let's see if we can find f(1). Maybe set x = 0 and y = 1. Then the original equation becomes f(0 + 1*f(0 + 1)) = 1² + f(0)f(1). So f(f(1)) = 1 + 1*f(1). So f(f(1)) = 1 + f(1). Hmm. Not sure yet. Maybe need another substitution.\n\nHow about setting y = 1 and varying x. Let's set y = 1. Then we have f(x + f(x + 1)) = 1 + f(x)f(1). Hmm. If we can express this as a recursive equation or something. Maybe not immediately helpful. Let's think of possible functions. The equation seems quadratic in y on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is a function of x and y. Maybe f is a quadratic function? Let's hypothesize that f(x) is a quadratic function. Let's assume f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then we can substitute into the equation and see if we can solve for a, b, c.\n\nBut before going into that, maybe check if f(x) = x² + c is a solution. Let's try f(x) = x² + c. Let's plug into the equation:\n\nLeft side: f(x + yf(x + y)) = (x + yf(x + y))² + c.\n\nRight side: y² + f(x)f(y) = y² + (x² + c)(y² + c) = y² + x² y² + c x² + c y² + c².\n\nSo equate left and right:\n\n(x + yf(x + y))² + c = y² + x² y² + c x² + c y² + c².\n\nLet's compute f(x + y) if f(x) = x² + c. Then f(x + y) = (x + y)² + c. Therefore, yf(x + y) = y[(x + y)² + c]. Then x + yf(x + y) = x + y(x + y)² + y c. Then squaring that:\n\n[x + y(x + y)² + y c]^2. That seems complicated. Let's see if this approach is going to work. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe f is linear? Let's try f(x) = ax + b. Let's see.\n\nLeft side: f(x + yf(x + y)) = a(x + yf(x + y)) + b = a x + a y f(x + y) + b.\n\nRight side: y² + f(x)f(y) = y² + (a x + b)(a y + b) = y² + a² x y + a b x + a b y + b².\n\nSo equate left and right:\n\na x + a y f(x + y) + b = y² + a² x y + a b x + a b y + b².\n\nBut f(x + y) = a(x + y) + b. Substitute that into left side:\n\na x + a y [a(x + y) + b] + b = a x + a² x y + a b y + b².\n\nSo left side becomes:\n\na x + a² x y + a b y + b.\n\nRight side is:\n\ny² + a² x y + a b x + a b y + b².\n\nSet them equal:\n\na x + a² x y + a b y + b = y² + a² x y + a b x + a b y + b².\n\nCancel terms on both sides. The a² x y terms are present on both sides. The a b y terms are also present. Then:\n\nLeft side: a x + b.\n\nRight side: y² + a b x + b².\n\nSo equate:\n\na x + b = y² + a b x + b².\n\nThis must hold for all x and y. Therefore, coefficients of like terms must be equal.\n\nFirst, coefficient of x: a = a b.\n\nCoefficient of y²: 0 = 1.\n\nBut 0 = 1 is impossible. Therefore, linear function cannot be a solution. So f is not linear. So quadratic function is the next guess.\n\nWait, maybe the function is of the form f(x) = x² + c. Let's try that again. Let me substitute f(x) = x² + c into the equation.\n\nLeft side: f(x + y f(x + y)) = (x + y f(x + y))² + c.\n\nFirst compute f(x + y): (x + y)² + c. Then y f(x + y) = y[(x + y)² + c]. Then x + y f(x + y) = x + y[(x + y)² + c]. Then square that and add c:\n\n[x + y(x + y)² + y c]^2 + c.\n\nRight side: y² + f(x)f(y) = y² + (x² + c)(y² + c) = y² + x² y² + c x² + c y² + c².\n\nSo equate left and right:\n\n[x + y(x + y)² + y c]^2 + c = y² + x² y² + c x² + c y² + c².\n\nThis looks complicated. Let's try expanding the left side:\n\nFirst, let's denote A = x + y(x + y)² + y c.\n\nSo A = x + y(x² + 2 x y + y²) + y c = x + x² y + 2 x y² + y³ + y c.\n\nThen A² = [x + x² y + 2 x y² + y³ + y c]^2.\n\nThis would result in a very long expression. Let's see if the terms can match the right side.\n\nThe right side is y² + x² y² + c x² + c y² + c².\n\nComparing terms, the left side A² must have terms up to degree 6 (since (x + ... )^2 would have x squared times y squared terms), but the right side is only up to y³ and x² y². This seems too complicated. Therefore, maybe f(x) = x² + c is not the solution. Maybe a different quadratic function?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(x) = x² + 1. Let's test this.\n\nLeft side: f(x + y f(x + y)) = (x + y f(x + y))² + 1.\n\nCompute f(x + y): (x + y)^2 + 1. Then y f(x + y) = y[(x + y)^2 + 1]. Then x + y f(x + y) = x + y[(x + y)^2 + 1] = x + y(x + y)^2 + y.\n\nThen square that and add 1:\n\n[x + y(x + y)^2 + y]^2 + 1.\n\nRight side: y² + f(x)f(y) = y² + (x² + 1)(y² + 1) = y² + x² y² + x² + y² + 1 = x² y² + x² + 2 y² + 1.\n\nSo equate left and right:\n\n[x + y(x + y)^2 + y]^2 + 1 = x² y² + x² + 2 y² + 1.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nFirst, expand x + y(x + y)^2 + y:\n\nLet me compute (x + y)^2 = x² + 2 x y + y². Then y(x + y)^2 = y x² + 2 x y² + y³. Then adding x and y:\n\nx + y x² + 2 x y² + y³ + y. So that's x + y + y x² + 2 x y² + y³.\n\nSo the expression inside the square is x + y + y x² + 2 x y² + y³. Then squaring this is going to be very complicated. Let's see if when squaring, the result matches the right side.\n\nBut the right side is x² y² + x² + 2 y² + 1. The left side is much more complicated. For example, the term y³ squared would be y^6, which isn't present on the right side. Therefore, f(x) = x² + 1 is not a solution. So quadratic functions of this form might not work. Maybe another approach.\n\nEarlier, we found that f(-y)f(y) = 1 - y². Let's see if we can use this. Suppose we let y = 1. Then f(-1)f(1) = 1 - 1 = 0. So f(-1)f(1) = 0. So either f(-1) = 0 or f(1) = 0. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: f(1) = 0.\n\nIf f(1) = 0, then let's see what happens. Let's set x = 1 in the original equation. Then f(1 + y f(1 + y)) = y² + f(1)f(y). Since f(1) = 0, this becomes f(1 + y f(1 + y)) = y² + 0 = y². Hmm, not sure. Let's see if we can find more information.\n\nAlternatively, set y = 1. Then f(x + f(x + 1)) = 1 + f(x)f(1). But f(1) = 0, so this becomes f(x + f(x + 1)) = 1 + 0 = 1. So for any x, f(x + f(x + 1)) = 1. If f is a constant function, then f(x) = 1 for all x, but we saw earlier that the constant function f(x) = 1 doesn't satisfy the original equation unless 1 = y² + 1*1 for all y, which is only true when y = 0. So f can't be constant. Therefore, f(x + f(x + 1)) = 1 for all x. So the argument of f is x + f(x + 1), and the value is always 1. So x + f(x + 1) must be a constant? Because if f is not constant, then f(k) = 1 for all k of the form x + f(x + 1). But unless x + f(x + 1) is constant, which would require that f(x + 1) = c - x for some constant c. Let's check that.\n\nSuppose x + f(x + 1) = c", "answer": "Net als in de eerste oplossing leiden we af dat \\( f(0) = 1 \\) en dat \\( f(1) = 0 \\) of \\( f(-1) = 0 \\).\n\nStel eerst dat \\( f(1) = 0 \\).

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, a non-degenerate triangle means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, for any a, b, c > 0, we need to find non-negative integers k, ℓ, m such that:\n\n1. an^k + bn^\\ell > cn^m\n2. an^k + cn^m > bn^\\ell\n3. bn^\\ell + cn^m > an^k\n\nBut this has to hold for all possible a, b, c > 0. That seems really strict. Because if n is too large or too small, maybe we can't satisfy these inequalities for all a, b, c. Let me think about possible values of n.\n\nLet's start with n=1. If n=1, then n^k = 1 for any k, so the sides would be a, b, c. But since a, b, c are arbitrary positive reals, we need that for any a, b, c, there exists a, b, c as sides of a triangle. Wait, but that's impossible because if someone picks a=1, b=1, c=3, then 1+1 is not greater than 3, so they can't form a triangle. But the problem states that for every triple (a, b, c), there exists some (k, ℓ, m). So for n=1, we need to adjust k, ℓ, m. Wait, no, the problem says \"for every (a, b, c) there exists a (k, ℓ, m)\". So even if a, b, c are bad, we can choose exponents k, ℓ, m to make them form a triangle.\n\nAh, right! So for each a, b, c, we can select exponents k, ℓ, m such that the three sides an^k, bn^\\ell, cn^m satisfy the triangle inequalities. So n=1 is possible? Let's check.\n\nIf n=1, then the sides are just a, b, c. But we need to choose k, ℓ, m (non-negative integers, so they can be 0,1,2,...) such that a, b, c form a triangle. But since a, b, c are arbitrary, we can't necessarily find such k, ℓ, m. For example, take a=1, b=1, c=3. Then 1,1,3 can't form a triangle. But if we take k=0, ℓ=0, m=0, then we have sides 1,1,1 which is a triangle. Wait, but the problem says that for every (a,b,c), there exists some (k, ℓ, m). So even though a=1, b=1, c=3 can't form a triangle with k=0, ℓ=0, m=0, maybe for different exponents, we can. But if we set k=0, ℓ=1, m=1, then the sides are 1, b, c. But if b and c are very large, say b=100, c=100, then 1 + 100 > 100? No, 1 + 100 = 101 > 100, but 1 + 100 > 100, but 100 + 100 > 1? Yes. So 1, 100, 100 would form a triangle. Wait, but in this case, the sides are 1, 100, 100. But the original a=1, but we set k=0, so the first side is 1*1^0=1. The second side is b*1^ℓ, so if ℓ=1, that's b*1= b. Wait, but in the example, we took b=100. But in reality, for a given (a, b, c), we need to choose k, ℓ, m such that an^k, bn^\\ell, cn^m form a triangle. So for a=1, b=1, c=3, we need to choose exponents such that 1*1^k, 1*1^\\ell, 3*1^m form a triangle. So sides 1,1,3. But 1+1 is not greater than 3, so even with exponents 0,0,0, it's not a triangle. So there's no exponents k, ℓ, m for a=1, b=1, c=3 that would make them form a triangle. Therefore, n=1 is invalid?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for every triple (a, b, c) of positive reals, there exists a triple (k, ℓ, m) of non-negative integers such that...\" So even if for some (a, b, c) you can't find exponents, then n is invalid. So for n=1, since if we take a=1, b=1, c=3, there's no k, ℓ, m such that 1, 1, 3 form a triangle. Therefore, n=1 is invalid. So n=1 is out.\n\nWait, but maybe the exponents can be negative? No, the problem states non-negative integers. So exponents can be 0,1,2,... So n^k is at least 1. Therefore, for a=1, b=1, c=3, we need sides 1*1^k, 1*1^\\ell, 3*1^m, which are 1,1,3. So no matter what k, ℓ, m we choose (they are non-negative integers, so exponents don't affect the value here since n=1). So 1,1,3 can't form a triangle. Therefore, n=1 is invalid. So n=1 is out.\n\nNext, n=2. Let's see. Suppose n=2. Then, for any a, b, c >0, we need to find non-negative integers k, ℓ, m such that 2^k a, 2^\\ell b, 2^m c form a triangle. So triangle inequalities:\n\n2^k a + 2^\\ell b > 2^m c\n\n2^k a + 2^m c > 2^\\ell b\n\n2^\\ell b + 2^m c > 2^k a\n\nWe need these to hold for some k, ℓ, m >=0. But since a, b, c are arbitrary, we need to choose exponents such that these inequalities hold. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nLet me take a=1, b=1, c=1. Then we need 2^k, 2^\\ell, 2^m to form a triangle. So for example, if k=0, ℓ=0, m=0, we have 1,1,1 which is a triangle. If k=1, ℓ=1, m=1, we have 2,2,2, which is also a triangle. If k=0, ℓ=0, m=1, we have 1,1,2. But 1+1=2, which is degenerate. But the problem states non-gedegenerate triangles, so m=1 is invalid here. So we need to have strict inequality. So for a=1, b=1, c=1, we can choose k=0, ℓ=0, m=0. So that's okay.\n\nBut what if a, b, c are different? Let's take a=1, b=1, c=1000. So sides 2^k, 2^\\ell, 2^m*1000. We need to choose k, ℓ, m such that 2^k + 2^\\ell > 1000*2^m. Wait, but 2^k + 2^\\ell is at most 2*2^max(k,ℓ) = 2^{max(k,ℓ)+1}. So if we set m to be max(k, ℓ) +1, then 2^{max(k, ℓ)+1} is 2*2^{max(k, ℓ)}. But 1000*2^m would be 1000*2^{max(k, ℓ)+1}, which is way larger. So 2^{max(k, ℓ)+1} is less than 1000*2^{max(k, ℓ)+1}, so inequality 2^k + 2^\\ell > 1000*2^m would not hold. Hmm, so maybe we need to set m smaller? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set m=0. Then the sides are 2^k, 2^\\ell, 1000. So we need 2^k + 2^\\ell > 1000. If we take k and ℓ large enough, say k=10, ℓ=10, then 2^10 + 2^10 = 2048 > 1000. Then check the other inequalities: 2^k + 1000 > 2^\\ell. If k=10, ℓ=10, then 2^10 + 1000 = 1024 + 1000 = 2024 > 1024, which is true. Similarly, 2^\\ell + 1000 > 2^k, same thing. So in this case, we can set k=10, ℓ=10, m=0. So sides 1024, 1024, 1000. But wait, 1024, 1024, 1000. Then 1024 + 1024 > 1000, which is true. 1024 + 1000 > 1024, which is 2024 > 1024, true. 1024 + 1000 > 1024, same. So that works. So for a=1, b=1, c=1000, we can choose k=10, ℓ=10, m=0. So that works.\n\nBut what if a, b, c are very small? Let's say a=0.0001, b=0.0001, c=0.0001. Then sides 0.0001*2^k, 0.0001*2^\\ell, 0.0001*2^m. We need 0.0001*2^k + 0.0001*2^\\ell > 0.0001*2^m. Dividing both sides by 0.0001, we get 2^k + 2^\\ell > 2^m. So same as before. So if we take k, ℓ, m such that 2^k + 2^\\ell > 2^m. For example, k=0, ℓ=0, m=0: 1 +1 >1, which is true. So sides would be 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001. So that works. So for very small a, b, c, we can set k=0, ℓ=0, m=0.\n\nBut what if two sides are very small and one is slightly larger? For example, a=1, b=1, c=1.0001. Then sides 2^k, 2^ℓ, 2^m*1.0001. We need 2^k + 2^ℓ > 1.0001*2^m. Let's see. If we set m=0, then we need 2^k + 2^ℓ > 1.0001. Since 2^k and 2^ℓ are at least 1, 1 +1 =2 >1.0001, so that works. Then check the other inequalities: 2^k + 1.0001*2^m > 2^\\ell. If k=0, ℓ=0, m=0: 1 +1.0001 >1, which is true. So that works. So even if c is slightly larger than a and b, as long as we set m=0, and k and ℓ=0, then the triangle inequalities hold. Wait, but 1 +1 >1.0001, which is 2 >1.0001, which is true. So that works. So even if c is just a bit larger, we can set exponents to 0.\n\nBut what if c is extremely large compared to a and b? Let's say a=1, b=1, c=10^100. Then, we need sides 2^k, 2^\\ell, 10^100*2^m. Let's try to choose exponents such that 2^k + 2^\\ell > 10^100*2^m. If we set m to be very large, say m=100, then 10^100*2^100 is enormous. So 2^k + 2^\\ell would need to be larger than that. But 2^k and 2^\\ell are at most 2^max(k, ℓ). So even if we set max(k, ℓ) = 200, then 2^200 is about 1.6e+60, which is way larger than 10^100*2^100 ≈ 1e+100 * 1e+30 = 1e+130. Wait, no, 2^100 is about 1e+30, so 10^100*2^100 is 1e+100 * 1e+30 = 1e+130. Whereas 2^200 is about 1e+60. So even 2^k + 2^\\ell would be at most 2*2^200 ≈ 2e+6", "answer": "Het is duidelijk dat \\( n = 1 \\) niet voldoet, want niet alle drie positieve reële getallen \\( a, b \\) en \\( c \\) zijn de lengtes van een driehoek.

Stel dat er \\( k, \\ell, m \\) bestaan zodat \\( n^k, 2n^\\ell \\) en \\( 3n^m \\) de lengtes van de zijden van een driehoek vormen. Merk allereerst op dat geen twee van deze drie getallen gelijk aan elkaar kunnen zijn, aangezien \\( n \\neq 2, 3 \\).

Dit proces stopt gegarandeerd, want er is een \\( i \\) zodat \\( n^i > a \\). Bekijk nu de \\( i \\) en \\( j \\) zodat \\( a \\geq n^ib + n^jc \\) en dit de laatste stap is waarin deze ongelijkheid geldt.

Verder is \\( n^ib \\leq n^jc \\), dus \\( n^{i+1}b \\leq n^{j+1}c < a + n^{j+1}c \\).

So, we have a sequence of positive integers defined by a₀ = 3, and then the recurrence relation a_{n+1} - a_n = n(a_n - 1) for all n ≥ 0. We need to find all integers m ≥ 2 such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of m and a_n is 1 for all n ≥ 0. That means m must be coprime with every term in the sequence. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the sequence better. Maybe compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or something.\n\nStarting with a₀ = 3.\n\nThen, for n = 0: a₁ - a₀ = 0*(a₀ - 1) => a₁ - 3 = 0*(3 - 1) = 0. So, a₁ = 3. Wait, that's the same as a₀. Hmm, but n starts at 0, so maybe n=0 gives a₁? Wait, the problem says \"voor alle n ≥ 0\", so n=0 is allowed. So, a₁ is computed when n=0. But in that case, the difference a₁ - a₀ is 0*(a₀ -1), so a₁ = a₀ + 0 = 3. So, a₁ = 3. Then, for n=1: a₂ - a₁ = 1*(a₁ -1) = 1*(3 -1) = 2. So, a₂ = a₁ + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nNext, n=2: a₃ - a₂ = 2*(a₂ -1) = 2*(5 -1) = 8. So, a₃ = 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nn=3: a₄ - a₃ = 3*(13 -1) = 3*12 = 36. So, a₄ = 13 + 36 = 49.\n\nn=4: a₅ - a₄ = 4*(49 -1) = 4*48 = 192. So, a₅ = 49 + 192 = 241.\n\nn=5: a₆ - a₅ = 5*(241 -1) = 5*240 = 1200. So, a₆ = 241 + 1200 = 1441.\n\nOkay, so the sequence starts: 3, 3, 5, 13, 49, 241, 1441, ...\n\nWait, interesting. Let me check if I computed those correctly.\n\na₀ = 3.\n\na₁: 3 + 0*(3-1) = 3. Then a₂: 3 + 1*(3-1) = 3 + 2 = 5. Then a₃: 5 + 2*(5 -1) = 5 + 8 = 13. Yes. a₄: 13 + 3*(13 -1) = 13 + 36 = 49. a₅: 49 + 4*(49 -1) = 49 + 4*48 = 49 + 192 = 241. a₆: 241 + 5*(241 -1) = 241 + 5*240 = 241 + 1200 = 1441. Okay, seems correct.\n\nSo, the terms are growing quite rapidly. Let me note them down:\n\nn: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\na_n: 3, 3, 5, 13, 49, 241, 1441\n\nNow, the problem is to find all m ≥ 2 such that gcd(m, a_n) = 1 for all n ≥ 0. So, m must not share any common factor with any a_n. That is, m must be coprime with every term in the sequence. Therefore, m must not have any prime factors that divide any a_n.\n\nTherefore, to find such m, we need to find all primes that divide at least one a_n, and then m must not be divisible by any of those primes. So, m must be 1 or a product of primes not dividing any a_n. But since m ≥ 2, m must be a product of primes not in the set of primes dividing any a_n.\n\nTherefore, our task reduces to finding all primes that divide any a_n, and then m must be 1 or a product of primes not in that set. But since m ≥ 2, m must be a product of primes not dividing any a_n. So, the problem is equivalent to finding primes that never divide any a_n, and then m can be any number composed of those primes.\n\nTherefore, first, we need to characterize the primes that divide some a_n, and then the primes that do not divide any a_n are the ones we can include in m.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find all primes p such that there exists some n where p divides a_n. Then, m must not be divisible by any such p. So, m must be a product of primes that do not divide any a_n.\n\nBut how do we find such primes?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence a_n contains all primes? But looking at the terms: 3, 5, 13, 49 (which is 7²), 241, 1441 (which is 11*131). So, primes like 7, 11, 131 appear here. But 7 divides a₄ = 49. So, primes can divide a_n. So, the primes that divide a_n are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 49 (which is 7²), 241, 1441 (11*131), etc.\n\nWait, 241 is prime? Let me check. 241: 241 divided by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. 2*120=240, so 241 is prime. 1441: Let's check if 1441 is prime. 1441 divided by 11: 11*131=1441. Yes, 11*131=1441. So, 1441 is composite, with factors 11 and 131.\n\nSo, primes dividing a_n so far include 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 131, 241, etc. So, primes can divide a_n. Therefore, m must not be divisible by any prime that divides at least one a_n. So, m must be composed of primes that never divide any a_n.\n\nTherefore, we need to find primes p such that p divides no a_n. Then, m must be a product of such primes. Since m ≥ 2, m can be any prime (or product of primes) in this set.\n\nTherefore, our task is to find all primes p such that p does not divide any a_n. Then, m can be any number composed of such primes.\n\nBut how do we find such primes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence a_n contains all primes except some? But looking at the terms, we have 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 241, 131, etc. So, 17 isn't in the list yet. Let me check a₅: 241. Is 17 a factor of any a_n?\n\nCheck a₀: 3, a₁:3, a₂:5, a₃:13, a₄:49, a₅:241, a₆:1441. 1441 is 11*131. So, 17 isn't a factor here. Let's compute a few more terms.\n\na₆ = 1441\n\nn=6: a₇ - a₆ = 6*(1441 -1) = 6*1440 = 8640. So, a₇ = 1441 + 8640 = 10081.\n\nIs 10081 divisible by 17? Let's check: 17*593 = 10081? 17*500=8500, 17*93=1581, so 8500+1581=10081. Yes! So, 17 divides a₇ = 10081. Therefore, 17 is a prime that divides a₇. Therefore, 17 is not a prime that can be in m.\n\nWhat about 19? Let's check if 19 divides any a_n. Let's compute a₇: 10081. 10081 divided by 19: 19*500=9500, 10081-9500=581. 19*30=570, 581-570=11. So, 19*530 +11. So, no. Then a₈: a₇ + 7*(a₇ -1) = 10081 +7*(10081 -1) = 10081 +7*10080 = 10081 +70560 = 80641.\n\nCheck 80641 divided by 19. Let's see: 19*4244 = 19*(4000 + 244) = 76000 + 4636 = 80636. Then 80641 -80636=5. So, 80641=19*4244 +5, so not divisible by 19. Next, a₉: a₈ +8*(a₈ -1)=80641 +8*(80641 -1)=80641 +8*80640=80641 +645120=725761.\n\nCheck 725761 divided by 19: 19*38198=725762, which is 1 more than 725761, so 725761=19*38198 -1, not divisible by 19. Continuing this way might not be efficient. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can characterize the primes that divide some a_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_{n+1} = a_n + n(a_n -1) = (n+1)a_n - n.\n\nSo, a_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n - n.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nStarting with a₀ = 3.\n\na₁ = (0+1)a₀ -0 = 1*3 -0 =3.\n\na₂ = (1+1)a₁ -1 = 2*3 -1=5.\n\na₃=3*5 -2=15-2=13.\n\na₄=4*13 -3=52-3=49.\n\na₅=5*49 -4=245-4=241.\n\na₆=6*241 -5=1446-5=1441.\n\na₇=7*1441 -6=10087-6=10081.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed a₇, I got 10081. But according to the previous computation, a₇ =10081. Then a₇=10081. Then a₈=8*10081 -7=80648 -7=80641.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n -n.\n\nThis seems like a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Maybe we can solve it.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as:\n\na_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n = -n.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard method to solve such equations is to find an integrating factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rewrite the recurrence in terms of a_{n+1}/(n+1)! and see if we can telescope the terms.\n\nLet me try dividing both sides by (n+1)!.\n\nLet’s define b_n = a_n / n!.\n\nThen, let's express the recurrence in terms of b_n.\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n -n.\n\nDivide both sides by (n+1)!:\n\na_{n+1}/(n+1)! = a_n /n! - n/(n+1)!.\n\nBut note that n/(n+1)! = n/( (n+1)*n! )) = 1/( (n+1)*(n! /n! )) = 1/(n+1).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn/(n+1)! = n / [ (n+1) * n! ] = (1/(n+1)) * [n / n!] = (1/(n+1)) * (1/( (n-1)! )) )? Wait, maybe not. Wait, n! = n*(n-1)!.\n\nTherefore, n/(n+1)! = n / [ (n+1)*n! ] = n / [ (n+1)*n*(n-1)! ) ] = 1 / [ (n+1)*(n-1)! ) ].\n\nHmm, maybe not the most helpful. Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me compute b_{n+1} = a_{n+1}/(n+1)!.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n -n.\n\nTherefore,\n\nb_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n -n / (n+1)! = [ (n+1)a_n / (n+1)!", "answer": "Een directe formule voor de rij wordt gegeven door \\( a_n = 2 \\cdot n! + 1 \\) voor \\( n \\geq 0 \\).  \n(We gebruiken de gangbare definitie \\( 0! = 1 \\), die voldoet aan \\( 1! = 1 \\cdot 0! \\), zoals ook voor grotere \\( n \\) geldt \\( n! = n \\cdot (n - 1)! \\).)  \n\nWe bewijzen de directe formule met inductie.

Let me start by trying to understand the structure of these equations. Each equation involves the sum of two variables on the left side and a quadratic expression involving the squares of the other two variables plus six times the product of those two variables on the right side. \n\nFirst, I notice that each equation is symmetric in some way. For example, the first equation relates x₁ and x₂ to x₃ and x₄, the second relates x₁ and x₃ to x₂ and x₄, and so on. This symmetry might suggest that the solution could have some variables equal to each other or follow a particular pattern. Maybe all variables are equal? Let me check that first because symmetric solutions are common in such problems.\n\nSuppose all variables are equal: x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = x₄ = a. Then plug this into the first equation:\n\nLeft side: a + a = 2a\n\nRight side: a² + a² + 6a*a = 2a² + 6a² = 8a²\n\nSo, 2a = 8a² → 8a² - 2a = 0 → 2a(4a - 1) = 0 → a = 0 or a = 1/4\n\nSo, possible solutions where all variables are equal are (0, 0, 0, 0) and (1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4). Let me check if these satisfy all equations.\n\nFor (0,0,0,0):\n\nEach left side is 0 + 0 = 0. Right side is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So all equations hold.\n\nFor (1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4):\n\nLeft side: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n\nRight side: (1/4)² + (1/4)² + 6*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 + 1/16 + 6/16 = 8/16 = 1/2. So each equation holds. So these are two solutions.\n\nBut are there more solutions where variables aren't all equal? Maybe some variables are equal, others different? Or maybe variables come in pairs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let me see.\n\nTake the first equation: x₁ + x₂ = x₃² + x₄² + 6x₃x₄\n\nSecond equation: x₁ + x₃ = x₂² + x₄² + 6x₂x₄\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(x₁ + x₂) - (x₁ + x₃) = (x₃² + x₄² + 6x₃x₄) - (x₂² + x₄² + 6x₂x₄)\n\nSimplify left side: x₂ - x₃\n\nRight side: x₃² - x₂² + 6x₃x₄ - 6x₂x₄ = (x₃ - x₂)(x₃ + x₂) + 6x₄(x₃ - x₂) = (x₃ - x₂)(x₃ + x₂ + 6x₄)\n\nSo overall:\n\nx₂ - x₃ = (x₃ - x₂)(x₃ + x₂ + 6x₄)\n\nFactor out (x₃ - x₂) on the right:\n\nx₂ - x₃ = -(x₂ - x₃)(x₃ + x₂ + 6x₄)\n\nSo, move all terms to one side:\n\n(x₂ - x₃) + (x₂ - x₃)(x₃ + x₂ + 6x₄) = 0\n\nFactor out (x₂ - x₃):\n\n(x₂ - x₃)[1 + x₃ + x₂ + 6x₄] = 0\n\nTherefore, either x₂ = x₃ or 1 + x₂ + x₃ + 6x₄ = 0\n\nSimilarly, if we subtract other pairs of equations, we might get similar conditions. For example, subtract the third equation from the first:\n\nFirst equation: x₁ + x₂ = x₃² + x₄² + 6x₃x₄\n\nThird equation: x₁ + x₄ = x₂² + x₃² + 6x₂x₃\n\nSubtracting third from first:\n\n(x₁ + x₂) - (x₁ + x₄) = (x₃² + x₄² + 6x₃x₄) - (x₂² + x₃² + 6x₂x₃)\n\nLeft side: x₂ - x₄\n\nRight side: x₄² - x₂² + 6x₃x₄ - 6x₂x₃ = (x₄ - x₂)(x₄ + x₂) + 6x₃(x₄ - x₂) = (x₄ - x₂)(x₄ + x₂ + 6x₃)\n\nThus:\n\nx₂ - x₄ = (x₄ - x₂)(x₄ + x₂ + 6x₃)\n\nFactor out (x₄ - x₂) = -(x₂ - x₄):\n\nx₂ - x₄ = - (x₂ - x₄)(x₄ + x₂ + 6x₃)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(x₂ - x₄) + (x₂ - x₄)(x₄ + x₂ + 6x₃) = 0\n\nFactor out (x₂ - x₄):\n\n(x₂ - x₄)[1 + x₂ + x₄ + 6x₃] = 0\n\nTherefore, either x₂ = x₄ or 1 + x₂ + x₄ + 6x₃ = 0\n\nSimilarly, subtracting other equations may lead to similar conditions for other pairs.\n\nSo, in general, for each pair of variables, either they are equal or some linear combination of the other variables is -1/6.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we can consider cases where some variables are equal.\n\nCase 1: All variables are equal. We already found these solutions.\n\nCase 2: Two variables are equal, others different. Wait, but with four variables, there are multiple subcases. Maybe first assume x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = x₄, which is covered in Case 1. If two variables are equal, but others are different, perhaps x₁ = x₂ ≠ x₃ ≠ x₄. But this might get too complicated. Alternatively, maybe variables can be grouped into two pairs.\n\nSuppose x₁ = x₂ and x₃ = x₄. Let's see if that works.\n\nLet x₁ = x₂ = a and x₃ = x₄ = b.\n\nPlug into the first equation:\n\na + a = b² + b² + 6b*b → 2a = 2b² + 6b² = 8b² → a = 4b²\n\nSecond equation: x₁ + x₃ = x₂² + x₄² + 6x₂x₄\n\nLeft side: a + b\n\nRight side: a² + b² + 6a*b\n\nSo:\n\na + b = a² + b² + 6ab\n\nBut since a = 4b², substitute:\n\n4b² + b = (4b²)² + b² + 6*(4b²)*b\n\nSimplify:\n\n4b² + b = 16b⁴ + b² + 24b³\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n16b⁴ + 24b³ + b² - 4b² - b = 0 → 16b⁴ + 24b³ - 3b² - b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb(16b³ + 24b² - 3b - 1) = 0\n\nSo, either b = 0 or solve 16b³ + 24b² - 3b - 1 = 0\n\nIf b = 0, then a = 0, so all variables are zero, which is the trivial solution we found earlier.\n\nNow, solve 16b³ + 24b² - 3b - 1 = 0. Let's try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16.\n\nTest b = 1: 16 + 24 - 3 - 1 = 36 ≠ 0\n\nb = -1: -16 + 24 + 3 - 1 = 10 ≠ 0\n\nb = 1/2: 16*(1/8) + 24*(1/4) - 3*(1/2) -1 = 2 + 6 - 1.5 -1 = 5.5 ≠ 0\n\nb = -1/2: 16*(-1/2)^3 +24*(-1/2)^2 -3*(-1/2) -1 = 16*(-1/8) +24*(1/4) + 1.5 -1 = -2 +6 +1.5 -1 = 4.5 ≠0\n\nb = 1/4: 16*(1/64) +24*(1/16) -3*(1/4) -1 = 0.25 + 1.5 -0.75 -1 = -0.0 → Wait, 0.25 +1.5 =1.75; 1.75 -0.75=1; 1 -1=0. So b=1/4 is a root.\n\nSo, we can factor (b - 1/4) from the polynomial.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide 16b³ +24b² -3b -1 by (b - 1/4). Wait, but synthetic division with b=1/4:\n\nCoefficients: 16, 24, -3, -1\n\nBring down 16. Multiply by 1/4: 4. Add to next term: 24 +4=28\n\nMultiply 28 by 1/4=7. Add to -3: 4\n\nMultiply 4 by1/4=1. Add to -1: 0. So the polynomial factors as (b -1/4)(16b² +28b +4)\n\nNow, set 16b² +28b +4=0. Divide by 4: 4b² +7b +1=0\n\nSolutions: b = [-7 ±√(49 -16)] /8 = [-7 ±√33]/8\n\nSo roots are b=1/4, b=(-7 +√33)/8, b=(-7 -√33)/8\n\nSo, possible b values: 1/4, (-7 +√33)/8, (-7 -√33)/8\n\nThen a =4b². For b=1/4, a=4*(1/16)=1/4, which is the all-1/4 solution.\n\nFor b=(-7 +√33)/8, compute a=4*[( -7 +√33 ) /8]^2\n\nSimilarly for the other root.\n\nBut let's check if these solutions satisfy the other equations. Wait, we assumed x₁ =x₂ =a and x₃=x₄=b, so we need to check if the other equations (3rd,4th,5th,6th) hold.\n\nWait, the first two equations are already considered. Let's check the third equation:\n\nThird equation: x₁ + x₄ = x₂² + x₃² +6x₂x₃\n\nLeft side: a + b\n\nRight side: a² + b² +6ab\n\nBut we already used the second equation to get this condition, so if we substituted into the second equation, then the third equation would be redundant? Wait, no. Wait, when we set x₁=x₂=a and x₃=x₄=b, then equations 1 and 2 are:\n\n1. 2a = 2b² +6b² =8b² → a=4b²\n\n2. a + b = a² + b² +6ab\n\nBut equation 3: a + b = a² + b² +6ab (same as equation 2). So equations 1,2,3 are not all independent. Similarly, equations 4,5,6 would be similar. So, perhaps the other equations are redundant given the first few. Let me verify.\n\nFourth equation: x₂ + x₃ = x₁² + x₄² +6x₁x₄\n\nLeft side: a + b\n\nRight side: a² + b² +6a*b\n\nWhich is the same as equation 2. So equations 1,2,3,4,5,6 all reduce to the same conditions when x₁=x₂=a and x₃=x₄=b. Therefore, the solutions found here are valid. So, in this case, we have three possibilities for b: 0, 1/4, (-7 ±√33)/8. But when b=0, a=0, which is the trivial solution. The other solutions are a=4b² where b=1/4, (-7 +√33)/8, (-7 -√33)/8. Let me compute these.\n\nFirst, when b=1/4, a=4*(1/4)^2=4*(1/16)=1/4. So, this gives all variables equal to 1/4, which is already covered in Case 1.\n\nNow, for b=(-7 +√33)/8. Let's compute a=4b².\n\nFirst, compute b:\n\nb = (-7 +√33)/8 ≈ (-7 +5.7446)/8 ≈ (-1.2554)/8 ≈ -0.1569\n\nSo, a=4*( (-7 +√33)/8 )²\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, square the numerator: (-7 +√33)^2 = 49 -14√33 +33 = 82 -14√33\n\nTherefore, a=4*(82 -14√33)/64 = ( (82 -14√33)/16", "answer": "De eerste twee vergelijkingen van elkaar afhalen geeft  \n\\[\nx_2 - x_3 = x_3^2 - x_2^2 + 6x_4(x_3 - x_2),\n\\]  \nwat we kunnen ontbinden als  \n\\[\n0 = (x_3 - x_2)(x_3 + x_2 + 1 + 6x_4).\n\\]  \nWe zien dat \\( x_2 = x_3 \\) of \\( x_2 + x_3 + 1 + 6x_4 = 0 \\). Analoog geldt ook dat \\( x_2 = x_3 \\) of \\( x_2 + x_3 + 1 + 6x_1 = 0 \\). Dus als \\( x_2 \\neq x_3 \\), dan geldt in beide gevallen de tweede gelijkheid; die van elkaar afhalen geeft \\( x_1 = x_4 \\). We concluderen dat \\( x_2 = x_3 \\) of \\( x_1 = x_4 \\). Analoog geldt voor elke permutatie \\( (i, j, k, l) \\) van \\( (1, 2, 3, 4) \\) dat \\( x_i = x_j \\) of \\( x_k = x_l \\).\n\nWe bewijzen nu dat minstens drie van de \\( x_i \\) gelijk aan elkaar zijn. Als ze alle vier gelijk zijn, is dat natuurlijk waar. Anders zijn er twee die ongelijk zijn, zeg zonder verlies van algemeenheid \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\). Dan geldt \\( x_3 = x_4 \\). Als nu \\( x_1 = x_3 \\), dan zijn er drie elementen aan elkaar gelijk. Anders is \\( x_1 \\neq x_3 \\), dus \\( x_2 = x_4 \\) en ook dan zijn er drie elementen aan elkaar gelijk. Het viertal \\( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\) is dus op volgorde na van de vorm \\( (x, x, x, y) \\), waarbij eventueel mag gelden dat \\( x = y \\).\n\nDit invullen in de gegeven vergelijkingen geeft \\( x + y = 8x^2 \\) en \\( 2x = x^2 + y^2 + 6xy \\). Tel deze twee vergelijkingen bij elkaar op:  \n\\[\n3x + y = 9x^2 + y^2 + 6xy.\n\\]  \nDe rechterkant is te ontbinden als \\( (3x + y)^2 \\). Met \\( s = 3x + y \\) staat er dus \\( s = s^2 \\), waaruit volgt \\( s = 0 \\) of \\( s = 1 \\). Er geldt \\( s = 3x + y = 2x + (x + y) = 2x + 8x^2 \\). Dus \\( 8x^2 + 2x = 0 \\) of \\( 8x^2 + 2x = 1 \\).\n\nIn het eerste geval geldt \\( x = 0 \\) of \\( x = -\\frac{1}{4} \\). We vinden \\( y = 0 - 3x = 0 \\) respectievelijk \\( y = \\frac{3}{4} \\). In het tweede geval kunnen we de vergelijking ontbinden als \\( (4x - 1)(2x + 1) = 0 \\), dus \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). We vinden \\( y = 1 - 3x = \\frac{1}{4} \\) respectievelijk \\( y = \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\nAlles bij elkaar hebben we de volgende viertallen gevonden:  \n\\[\n(0, 0, 0, 0), \\; \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\n\\]  \nen de permutaties hiervan,  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\; \\text{en} \\; \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n\\]  \nen de permutaties hiervan.
