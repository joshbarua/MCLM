Then Lolek, for each of these 2n points, draws two half-lines starting at that point: one vertical and one horizontal. The goal is to figure out the maximum integer k such that Lolek can always create at least k regions, no matter how Bolek places the points. \n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the setup. We have 2n points, each with a unique x-coordinate and a unique y-coordinate. So, if I imagine these points, they form a grid-like structure but not necessarily a perfect grid. Each point has a vertical half-line (either up or down) and a horizontal half-line (either left or right). The question is about how these half-lines can divide the plane into regions. We need to find the minimal number of regions that Lolek can guarantee, regardless of how Bolek arranges the points.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that when you have lines (or half-lines) dividing the plane, the maximum number of regions is given by a certain formula, but here it's about half-lines. Also, since each point has two half-lines, one vertical and one horizontal, the arrangement will consist of these half-lines. Each half-line will either go left, right, up, or down from each point. But since the points are placed such that no two share a vertical or horizontal line, each half-line direction (left, right, up, down) can only be used once per column or row, respectively. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nEach point has a vertical half-line. Since all the points have distinct x-coordinates, if we have a vertical half-line going up or down from each point, these could be arranged in such a way that they don't overlap. Similarly, horizontal half-lines from each point (left or right) will also not overlap if their y-coordinates are distinct.\n\nBut the key is that the regions are created by the intersections of these half-lines. Each intersection of a vertical and horizontal half-line will create a new region. So, the number of regions depends on how the vertical and horizontal half-lines cross each other.\n\nBut since each vertical half-line is only from one point, and each horizontal half-line is only from one point, the intersections can only occur where a vertical half-line from one point meets a horizontal half-line from another point. So, the total number of intersections will be the number of pairs of vertical and horizontal half-lines that cross each other. Each such intersection creates a new region.\n\nWait, but how exactly does this work? Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have just two points. Each point has a vertical and horizontal half-line. Let's say the first point has a vertical half-line going up and a horizontal half-line going right. The second point has a vertical half-line going down and a horizontal half-line going left. Depending on their positions, these half-lines can intersect, creating regions.\n\nBut since the points are placed such that no two share a vertical or horizontal line, their coordinates are unique. So, for example, if the first point is at (x1, y1), the second at (x2, y2), with x1 ≠ x2 and y1 ≠ y2.\n\nIf the first point's vertical half-line is upwards, and the second's vertical half-line is downwards. Then, depending on their x-coordinates, these vertical half-lines will only meet if their x-coordinates are on either side. Similarly for horizontal half-lines.\n\nWait, but vertical half-lines go either up or down from each point, but their direction is fixed once chosen. Similarly, horizontal half-lines go left or right. So, for each point, we choose one direction for vertical and one direction for horizontal. The choices of directions (up/down and left/right) determine how the half-lines interact with others.\n\nEach vertical half-line can potentially intersect with all horizontal half-lines from other points, and each horizontal half-line can potentially intersect with all vertical half-lines from other points. Each intersection creates a new region. So, the total number of intersections is the number of vertical half-lines times the number of horizontal half-lines. But wait, each vertical half-line is from one point, and each horizontal half-line is from another point. So, the total number of vertical half-lines is 2n, and horizontal half-lines is 2n. But since each vertical half-line is from a unique point, and each horizontal half-line is from a unique point, the total number of intersections would be (2n) * (2n) = 4n². But this can't be right because each intersection is a unique crossing between a vertical and horizontal half-line, but depending on their arrangement, some intersections might not occur.\n\nWait, actually, if we have a vertical half-line from point A and a horizontal half-line from point B, whether they intersect depends on the relative positions of A and B. If point A is to the left or right of point B, and the vertical half-line from A is going left or right, and the horizontal half-line from B is going up or down. Since all points have distinct x and y coordinates, the vertical half-line from A will span all y's, but since it's a half-line, it only goes in one direction. Similarly, the horizontal half-line from B only goes in one direction.\n\nWait, actually, half-lines are infinite in one direction. So, a vertical half-line from point A going up would extend infinitely in the positive y-direction from A, and similarly for the others. Similarly, a horizontal half-line from point B going right would extend infinitely in the positive x-direction.\n\nTherefore, two half-lines, one vertical (up or down) from point A and one horizontal (left or right) from point B, will intersect if and only if the vertical half-line from A reaches the horizontal half-line from B's direction. For example, if A's vertical half-line is going up, then it will intersect B's horizontal half-line if B's horizontal half-line is going right and B is to the right of A, or B's horizontal half-line is going left and B is to the left of A. Wait, no. Let's think in terms of coordinates.\n\nSuppose point A is at (x_A, y_A), and point B is at (x_B, y_B). The vertical half-line from A going up is the set of points (x_A, y) where y >= y_A. The vertical half-line going down is y <= y_A. Similarly, the horizontal half-line from B going right is (x, y_B) where x >= x_B, and left is x <= x_B.\n\nSo, the vertical half-line from A and horizontal half-line from B will intersect if and only if:\n\n- If A's vertical half-line is up and B's horizontal half-line is right: Then they intersect if x_B >= x_A and y_B >= y_A.\n\n- If A's vertical half-line is up and B's horizontal half-line is left: They intersect if x_B <= x_A and y_B >= y_A.\n\n- If A's vertical half-line is down and B's horizontal half-line is right: They intersect if x_B >= x_A and y_B <= y_A.\n\n- If A's vertical half-line is down and B's horizontal half-line is left: They intersect if x_B <= x_A and y_B <= y_A.\n\nTherefore, for each pair of points A and B, depending on their directions, they can have 0, 1, or 2 intersections? Wait, no. Each vertical half-line from A can intersect each horizontal half-line from B at most once. Because vertical half-lines are vertical lines in one direction, horizontal half-lines are horizontal lines in one direction. So, a vertical line and a horizontal line can only intersect once unless they are parallel, but since each half-line is in a specific direction, they can only intersect once if they are not parallel. But vertical and horizontal are always perpendicular, so they will intersect exactly once if they are not blocked by the direction.\n\nWait, no. If a vertical half-line is going up from A, and a horizontal half-line is going right from B, they will intersect if A is to the left of B and B is below A? Wait, no. Let me get the coordinates straight.\n\nSuppose vertical half-line from A going up: This is the ray starting at (x_A, y_A) and going up infinitely. So, it covers all points (x_A, y) where y >= y_A.\n\nHorizontal half-line from B going right: This is the ray starting at (x_B, y_B) and going right infinitely. It covers all points (x, y_B) where x >= x_B.\n\nThese two half-lines intersect if there exists a point (x, y) that is on both rays. So, x must be >= x_A (if the vertical half-line is going up, but actually, the vertical half-line's x-coordinate is fixed at x_A. Wait, no, the vertical half-line starting at A going up is (x_A, y) with y >= y_A. The horizontal half-line starting at B going right is (x, y_B) with x >= x_B.\n\nSo, their intersection would be at (x_A, y_B) if x_A >= x_B and y_B >= y_A. Wait, no. Because the vertical half-line is at x = x_A, y >= y_A. The horizontal half-line is at y = y_B, x >= x_B. So, their intersection is the point (x_A, y_B) if x_A >= x_B and y_B >= y_A. Otherwise, they don't intersect.\n\nSimilarly, vertical half-line from A going down is (x_A, y) with y <= y_A. Horizontal half-line from B going left is (x, y_B) with x <= x_B. These intersect at (x_A, y_B) if x_A <= x_B and y_B <= y_A.\n\nSimilarly, vertical up and horizontal left: Intersection at (x_A, y_B) if x_A <= x_B and y_B >= y_A.\n\nVertical down and horizontal right: Intersection at (x_A, y_B) if x_A >= x_B and y_B <= y_A.\n\nSo, in total, for each pair of points A and B, depending on the directions of their half-lines, they can intersect at most once. Specifically, if the vertical half-line from A and horizontal half-line from B cross each other, then they form an intersection point. The number of such intersections depends on the relative positions and directions of the half-lines.\n\nTherefore, the total number of intersections is equal to the number of pairs (A, B) where the vertical half-line from A and horizontal half-line from B cross each other. Each such intersection contributes to a new region. The number of regions created by these intersections can be calculated using the formula for regions formed by lines, but here we have half-lines instead of full lines.\n\nWait, but each intersection of two half-lines divides the plane into more regions. However, since half-lines are infinite in one direction, the formula might be different. For example, a single vertical half-line divides the plane into two regions. A horizontal half-line can intersect the vertical half-line, creating more regions. Each new line (or half-line) can potentially add as many regions as the number of times it crosses previous lines.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this. Let's think of the vertical half-lines and horizontal half-lines as forming a grid. However, since each half-line is only from a single point, it's more like a set of vertical and horizontal rays starting from each point, but in specific directions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each vertical half-line can be thought of as a ray in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) from each point. But since the points are placed such that no two share a vertical or horizontal line, each vertical direction (up or down) is unique per column, and each horizontal direction (left or right) is unique per row.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the vertical half-lines as forming a set of vertical lines in different directions (up or down) from each point, and similarly horizontal half-lines as horizontal lines in different directions (left or right) from each point. The total arrangement is similar to a grid, but each line is only present from a single point.\n\nBut how does this affect the number of regions? If we have n vertical lines and n horizontal lines, the maximum number of regions is (n+1)(n+1). But here, we have 2n vertical half-lines and 2n horizontal half-lines. Wait, but each vertical half-line is only from one point, so they are not overlapping in x-coordinate. Similarly for horizontal.\n\nWait, actually, each vertical half-line is along a vertical line x = x_i, starting at y = y_i ± some direction. Similarly, horizontal half-lines are along y = y_i, starting at x = x_i ± some direction. So, the vertical half-lines are at different x-coordinates, each going either up or down. Similarly, horizontal half-lines are at different y-coordinates, each going left or right.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is similar to a grid where each vertical line x = x_i is split into two rays: one going up and one going down, depending on the direction chosen for that point. Similarly, each horizontal line y = y_j is split into two rays: left or right.\n\nSo, in total, we have 2n vertical rays and 2n horizontal rays. Each vertical ray is on a unique vertical line, and each horizontal ray is on a unique horizontal line. The intersections between vertical and horizontal rays will create regions.\n\nBut how many regions can we have? Let's think of each vertical ray as a line that can intersect with horizontal rays. Each intersection between a vertical and horizontal ray will create a new region. However, since each vertical ray is only present in one direction (up or down) and starts at a unique point, the number of intersections depends on how the directions are chosen.\n\nTo maximize the number of regions, Lolek would want to maximize the minimize the number of intersections? Wait, the problem says Lolek wants to arrange the half-lines such that the number of regions is maximized, but we need the minimal k such that no matter how Bolek places the points, Lolek can always get at least k regions. So, k is the minimal number that works for any configuration of points.\n\nWait, so we need to find the minimal k such that, regardless of how Bolek places the 2n points (with no two on the same vertical or horizontal line), Lolek can draw the half-lines (vertical and horizontal from each point) in such a way that the regions are at least k.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal number k such that for any 2n points arranged with unique x and y coordinates, Lolek can choose directions (up/down and left/right) for each point's half-lines to create at least k regions.\n\nSo, the question is: what is the minimal k that is always achievable, no matter the point configuration.\n\nFirst, let's think about the maximum possible number of regions. If Lolek can arrange the half-lines to cross as much as possible, then the number of regions would be maximized. However, the problem is about the minimal k that Lolek can guarantee regardless of Bolek's placement.

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. We have to find all n where we can assign either +1 or -1 to each coefficient from 1 to n, and the total sum is zero. So, for example, if n is 1, the sum would be either 1 or -1, which can't be zero. So n=1 is out. For n=2, we have 1·s₁ + 2·s₂ = 0. Let's see: possible assignments are s₁=1, s₂=-1: 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ 0; s₁=-1, s₂=1: -1 + 2 = 1 ≠ 0. So n=2 also doesn't work. Next, n=3.\n\nFor n=3: 1·s₁ + 2·s₂ + 3·s₃ = 0. Let's try different combinations. Let's suppose s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=-1: 1 + 2 - 3 = 0. Oh, that works! So n=3 is possible. So n=3 is valid. So maybe odd numbers? Wait, but let's check n=4.\n\nFor n=4: 1·s₁ + 2·s₂ + 3·s₃ + 4·s₄ = 0. Let's try to find a combination. Let me think. Suppose we set s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=1, s₄=-1: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 2 ≠ 0. Not good. What if s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=-1, s₄=-1: 1 + 2 - 3 -4 = -4 ≠ 0. Hmm. Maybe different assignments. Let's see: Let's try s₁=1, s₂=-1, s₃=1, s₄=-1: 1 - 2 + 3 -4 = -2 ≠0. Still not. Maybe s₁=-1, s₂=1, s₃=-1, s₄=1: -1 + 2 -3 +4 = 2 ≠0. Hmm. Maybe s₁=-1, s₂=-1, s₃=1, s₄=1: -1 -2 +3 +4=4≠0. Not working. Maybe s₁=1, s₂=-1, s₃=-1, s₄=1: 1 -2 -3 +4=0. Oh, wait! 1 -2 -3 +4 = 0. Yes! So that works. So n=4 is possible. So n=4 is valid. So n=3 and n=4 work. What about n=5?\n\nn=5: Let's see. Let's try similar approach. Maybe set some positive and negative signs to balance. Let's think of the total sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 = 15. If we want the sum to be zero, we need to partition the numbers into two subsets where the difference is 15. Wait, but the total sum is 15, so if we want the sum of one subset minus the sum of the other to be 0, that would mean the difference is 15 - 2*sum = 0, so sum = 7.5. But 7.5 is not an integer, so it's impossible. Wait, but that's the standard partition problem. Wait, but maybe the problem here is different. Wait, in the standard partition problem, we want to split the set into two subsets with equal sum. Here, the coefficients are fixed as 1,2,3,4,5, but multiplied by ±1. So maybe the problem is equivalent to partitioning the set {1,2,3,4,5} into two subsets where the sum of one subset minus the sum of the other is equal to zero. But that would require that the total sum is even. Wait, the total sum is 15, which is odd. Therefore, it's impossible to split into two subsets with equal sums because 15 is odd. Therefore, n=5 is impossible. Wait, but let's check manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's try to assign signs. Let's try s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=1, s₄=1, s₅=-1: 1+2+3+4-5=5≠0. Not good. How about s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=-1, s₄=-1, s₅=1: 1+2-3-4+5=1≠0. Still not. Maybe s₁=-1, s₂=-1, s₃=1, s₄=-1, s₅=1: -1-2+3-4+5=1≠0. Hmm. Maybe s₁=1, s₂=-1, s₃=-1, s₄=1, s₅=-1: 1-2-3+4-5=-5≠0. Hmm. Maybe s₁=-1, s₂=1, s₃=1, s₄=-1, s₅=-1: -1+2+3-4-5=-5≠0. Not working. Maybe s₁=1, s₂=-1, s₃=1, s₄=-1, s₅=1: 1-2+3-4+5=3≠0. Still not. Hmmm. Maybe n=5 is impossible. So total sum is 15, which is odd, so impossible. Therefore, n=5 is out.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. For the sum to be zero, the sum of the positive terms minus the sum of the negative terms must be zero. So sum_positive - sum_negative = 0 => sum_positive = sum_negative. But sum_positive + sum_negative = total sum, which is 15. So 2*sum_positive = 15, which implies sum_positive = 7.5, which is impossible because sum_positive must be an integer. Therefore, n=5 is impossible. So for n=5, it's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for n=6. Let's check n=6. Total sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is odd. So again, same problem. Therefore, impossible. Wait, but maybe if n is even, the total sum is n(n+1)/2. So if that is even, then it's possible? Wait, n=3: total sum 6, which is even. For n=3, we have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Then, to split into two subsets with sum 3 each. Wait, but 6/2=3. So in n=3, we can split into {1,2} and {3}, which sum to 3 and 3. Similarly, for n=4, total sum is 10, which is even. So 10/2=5. So we need to split into subsets with sum 5. For n=4, we have numbers 1,2,3,4. Can we split them into two subsets each summing to 5? Yes: {1,4} and {2,3}. So that's why n=4 works. Similarly, for n=6: total sum is 21, which is odd, so impossible. So the key seems to be that the total sum must be even, so that it can be split into two equal subsets. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the total sum n(n+1)/2 is even. So n(n+1)/2 is even. Therefore, n(n+1) must be divisible by 4. Because n(n+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, n(n+1) is divisible by 2. To make it divisible by 4, either n or n+1 must be divisible by 4. Therefore, n ≡ 0 mod 4 or n ≡ 3 mod 4. Wait, because if n is even, then n is divisible by 2, and for n(n+1) to be divisible by 4, n must be divisible by 4. If n is odd, then n+1 is even, so n+1 must be divisible by 4. Therefore, n ≡ 3 mod 4. So n must be congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. Therefore, the positive integers n where n is divisible by 4 or n ≡3 mod4. Let me check this with previous examples.\n\nn=3: 3≡3 mod4: works. n=4: 4≡0 mod4: works. n=5: 5≡1 mod4: doesn't work. n=6:6≡2 mod4: doesn't work. n=7:7≡3 mod4: let's check. Total sum 28, which is even. So need to split into two subsets each summing to 14. Let's see: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's try to make 14. Let's take 7,6,1: 7+6+1=14. So {7,6,1} and {5,4,3,2}. Then the sum would be (7+6+1) - (5+4+3+2) =14 -14=0. So yes, works. So n=7 works. Similarly, n=8: total sum 36, which is even. 36/2=18. So need to split into subsets summing to 18. Let's see: 8,7,3: 8+7+3=18. So {8,7,3} and {6,5,4,2,1}. Then 18 -18=0. So yes, works. So n=8 works. So n=8: 8≡0 mod4: works. So seems like the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all positive integers n where n ≡0 or 3 mod4. So n=3,4,7,8,11,12,... etc.\n\nBut let me verify with n=7 and n=8 as above. For n=7, total sum 28, so each subset must sum to 14. As shown, possible. For n=8, total sum 36, each subset 18. Possible. For n=12, total sum 78, each subset 39. Let's see if possible. Maybe a large enough n where the partition is possible. So yes, if the total sum is even, which happens when n ≡0 or3 mod4, then it's possible. Therefore, the answer should be all positive integers n such that n is congruent to 0 or3 modulo4. Therefore, the solution is all positive integers n with n ≡0 or3 mod4.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=3: 3≡3 mod4, works. n=4≡0 mod4, works. n=7≡3 mod4, works. n=8≡0 mod4, works. So seems correct. Therefore, the answer is all positive integers n where n modulo4 is either0 or3. So the final answer is all positive integers n such that n ≡0 or3 mod4, which can be written as n ≡0,3 mod4. So in boxed notation, the answer is all positive integers n congruent to 0 or 3 modulo4, which is expressed as n ≡0,3 mod4. But the problem asks to \"wyznaczyć все dodatnie liczby całkowite n\", so \"find all positive integers n\". So the answer is all n ≡0 or3 mod4. So in boxed form, we can write it as all positive integers n with n ≡0 or3 mod4. Since the question is in Chinese (assuming), but the answer is mathematical notation. The standard way is to present it as n ≡0,3 mod4, or using the notation for congruence. So the final answer is all positive integers n such that n ≡0 or3 mod4, which can be written in boxed form as \\boxed{n \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}}.\n\nWait, but sometimes in math competition answers, they might list it as n ≡0,3 (mod4). But the exact notation depends on the convention. Alternatively, since the problem is in Chinese, maybe the answer is expressed as n ≡0 or 3 mod4, so boxed as \\boxed{n \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}}.\n\nBut let me check once more. The key steps were:\n\n1. The total sum S = n(n+1)/2.\n\n2. For the sum to be zero, S must be even, so n(n+1)/2 is even ⇒ n(n+1) divisible by 4.\n\n3. Since n and n+1 are consecutive integers, one is even. So for their product to be divisible by 4, either n or n+1 must be divisible by 4.\n\n4. Therefore, n ≡0 mod4 or n ≡3 mod4.\n\n5.

Each one has two variables squared and a cross term multiplied by 4. The third equation is interesting because the right-hand side is negative. Let me see if I can find some pattern or symmetry here.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to subtract some equations or combine them. Let me look at equations 1 and 2. If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I get:\n\n\\( (a^2 + 4ab + b^2) - (b^2 + 4bc + c^2) = 1 - 1 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( a^2 + 4ab + b^2 - b^2 - 4bc - c^2 = 0 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies further to:\n\n\\( a^2 + 4ab - 4bc - c^2 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.

Let's see:\n\n\\( a^2 - c^2 + 4ab - 4bc \\)\n\nThat factors into:\n\n\\( (a - c)(a + c) + 4b(a - c) \\)\n\nSo, factoring out (a - c):\n\n\\( (a - c)(a + c + 4b) = 0 \\)\n\nOh! So either \\( a - c = 0 \\) or \\( a + c + 4b = 0 \\). That's a useful result. So from equations 1 and 2, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: \\( a = c \\)\n\nCase 2: \\( a + c + 4b = 0 \\)\n\nLet me explore both cases.\n\n**Case 1: a = c**\n\nIf a = c, then we can substitute c with a in equation 3. Let's see:\n\nEquation 3: \\( c^2 + 4ca + a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nSubstitute c = a:\n\n\\( a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 6a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nBut 6a² is non-negative since a² is non-negative, and the right-hand side is -2. This equation has no real solutions. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: a + c + 4b = 0**\n\nSo, from here, we can express a in terms of c and b, or c in terms of a and b. Let's solve for a:\n\n\\( a = -c - 4b \\)\n\nNow, let's substitute this into equations 1 and 2.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a^2 + 4ab + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute a = -c -4b:\n\n\\( (-c -4b)^2 + 4(-c -4b)b + b^2 = 1 \\)\n\nExpanding:\n\nFirst term: \\( c² + 8bc + 16b² \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( -4bc -16b² \\)\n\nThird term: \\( b² \\)\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n\\( c² + 8bc + 16b² -4bc -16b² + b² = 1 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\nc² + (8bc -4bc) + (16b² -16b² + b²) = 1\n\nWhich is:\n\nc² + 4bc + b² = 1\n\nBut wait, that's exactly equation 2. So substituting a into equation 1 gives us equation 2 again. That means equations 1 and 2 are dependent when a = -c -4b. So we need to use equation 2 and equation 3 with this substitution.\n\nSo, let's note that equation 2 is:\n\n\\( b^2 + 4bc + c^2 = 1 \\)\n\nWhich is the same as equation 1 after substitution. So equation 2 doesn't give us new information here. Therefore, we need to use equation 3 with the substitution a = -c -4b.\n\nEquation 3: \\( c^2 + 4ca + a^2 = -2 \\)\n\nSubstitute a = -c -4b:\n\nFirst, compute 4ca:\n\n4c(-c -4b) = -4c² -16bc\n\nThen, compute a²:\n\n(-c -4b)² = c² + 8bc + 16b²\n\nSo equation 3 becomes:\n\n\\( c² + (-4c² -16bc) + (c² + 8bc + 16b²) = -2 \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nc² -4c² -16bc + c² +8bc +16b²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(c² -4c² + c²) + (-16bc +8bc) +16b²\n\n= (-2c²) + (-8bc) +16b²\n\nTherefore:\n\n-2c² -8bc +16b² = -2\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2c² +8bc -16b² = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nc² +4bc -8b² =1\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( b^2 +4bc +c^2 =1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3 substitution: \\( c² +4bc -8b² =1 \\)\n\nSo let's write these two equations:\n\n1. \\( b^2 +4bc +c^2 =1 \\) (Equation 2)\n\n2. \\( c² +4bc -8b² =1 \\) (From substitution into equation 3)\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 3 substitution:\n\nWait, actually, let's write them again:\n\nEquation A: \\( b^2 +4bc +c^2 =1 \\)\n\nEquation B: \\( c² +4bc -8b² =1 \\)\n\nSubtract equation A from equation B:\n\n(c² +4bc -8b²) - (b² +4bc +c²) =1 -1\n\nSimplify:\n\nc² +4bc -8b² -b² -4bc -c² =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-9b² =0\n\nTherefore, -9b² =0 => b²=0 => b=0\n\nSo, b must be zero.\n\nNow, substitute b=0 into equation A:\n\nEquation A: \\( 0 +0 +c² =1 \\) => c²=1 => c=1 or c=-1\n\nSo c=1 or c=-1. Then, since a = -c -4b, and b=0, we have a = -c.\n\nTherefore, if c=1, then a=-1; if c=-1, then a=1.\n\nSo possible solutions:\n\n1. (a, b, c) = (-1, 0, 1)\n\n2. (a, b, c) = (1, 0, -1)\n\nNow, let's check these solutions in equation 3 to make sure.\n\nFirst, check (a, b, c) = (-1, 0, 1):\n\nEquation 3: \\( c² +4ca +a² = (-1)^2 +4*(-1)(1) + (-1)^2 =1 -4 +1 = -2 \\). Which matches the right-hand side.\n\nSecond, check (a, b, c) = (1, 0, -1):\n\nEquation 3: \\( (-1)^2 +4*(1)(-1) +1^2 =1 -4 +1 = -2 \\). Also matches.\n\nNow, check equations 1 and 2:\n\nFor (-1,0,1):\n\nEquation 1: \\( (-1)^2 +4*(-1)(0) +0^2 =1 +0 +0=1 \\). Correct.\n\nEquation 2: \\(0^2 +4*0*1 +1^2=0 +0 +1=1 \\). Correct.\n\nFor (1,0,-1):\n\nEquation 1: \\(1^2 +4*1*0 +0^2=1 +0 +0=1\\). Correct.\n\nEquation 2: \\(0^2 +4*0*(-1) + (-1)^2=0 +0 +1=1\\). Correct.\n\nSo both solutions satisfy all three equations.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are (a, b, c) = (-1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all trójki liczb realnych\", so these are the two solutions.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other possibilities. For instance, when we had Case 1, which led to no solution, and Case 2 gave two solutions. So I think these are the only solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, notice that each equation resembles the expansion of (x + y)^2. Let's see:\n\nThe first equation: \\( a^2 +4ab +b^2 = (a + 2b)^2 - 3b^2 \\). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe completing the square.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n\\( a^2 +4ab +b^2 \\). Let's see:\n\nThis is equal to \\( (a + b)^2 + 2ab \\). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively:\n\n\\( a^2 +4ab +b^2 = (a + 2b)^2 - 3b^2 \\). Let me verify:\n\n\\( (a + 2b)^2 = a² +4ab +4b² \\). So subtract 3b²: a² +4ab +b². Yes, exactly. So:\n\nFirst equation: \\( (a + 2b)^2 -3b² =1 \\)\n\nSimilarly, second equation: \\( (b + 2c)^2 -3c² =1 \\)\n\nThird equation: \\( (c + 2a)^2 -3a² =-2 \\)\n\nWait, that's an interesting observation. Let me write them out:\n\n1. \\( (a + 2b)^2 -3b² =1 \\)\n\n2. \\( (b + 2c)^2 -3c² =1 \\)\n\n3. \\( (c + 2a)^2 -3a² =-2 \\)\n\nHmm, maybe this can help. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s define variables:\n\nLet x = a + 2b\n\ny = b + 2c\n\nz = c + 2a\n\nThen, equations become:\n\n1. \\( x² -3b² =1 \\)\n\n2. \\( y² -3c² =1 \\)\n\n3. \\( z² -3a² =-2 \\)\n\nBut I don't know if this substitution helps. Maybe we can express a, b, c in terms of x, y, z. But seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding all three equations. Let me try:\n\nFirst equation: \\( (a + 2b)^2 -3b² =1 \\)\n\nSecond equation: \\( (b + 2c)^2 -3c² =1 \\)\n\nThird equation: \\( (c + 2a)^2 -3a² =-2 \\)\n\nAdding them all:\n\n\\( (a + 2b)^2 + (b + 2c)^2 + (c + 2a)^2 -3b² -3c² -3a² =1 +1 -2 \\)\n\nSimplify right-hand side:\n\n1 +1 -2 =0\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\nExpand the squares:\n\n(a² +4ab +4b²) + (b² +4bc +4c²) + (c² +4ca +4a²) -3a² -3b² -3c²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na² +4ab +4b² +b² +4bc +4c² +c² +4ca +4a² -3a² -3b² -3c²\n\nCompute each term:\n\na² +4a² -3a² = 2a²\n\n4b² +b² -3b² =2b²\n\n4c² +c² -3c² =2c²\n\n4ab +4bc +4ca =4(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo left-hand side becomes:\n\n2a² +2b² +2c² +4(ab + bc + ca)\n\nFactor 2:\n\n2(a² + b² +c² + 2ab + 2bc +2ca) = 2(a + b + c)^2\n\nTherefore, the sum of the equations becomes:\n\n2(a + b + c)^2 =0\n\nHence, (a + b + c)^2=0 => a + b + c =0\n\nSo, we have another equation: a + b + c =0\n\nNow, combining this with the previous result from Case 2 where a + c +4b=0. Wait, but in Case 2, we found that a + c +4b=0, and in this approach, we have a + b + c=0. Let's see if these can be combined.\n\nFrom a + b + c=0 and a + c +4b=0.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(a + c +4b) - (a + b + c)=0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3b=0 => b=0\n\nWhich is consistent with what we found earlier. Then, substituting b=0 into a + b + c=0 gives a + c=0, so c=-a.\n\nWhich is exactly the same as in Case 2.\n\nTherefore, this approach also leads us to b=0 and c=-a, so the solutions we found are indeed the only ones.\n\nTherefore, the only real solutions are (a, b, c) = (-1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, -1).\n\nI think that's all. Let me just confirm once more.\n\nGiven that a + b + c=0 and b=0, so a + c=0 => c=-a.\n\nThen substituting into equation 3:\n\nc² +4ca +a² = (-a)^2 +4c a +a² = a² +4(-a)a +a² = a² -4a² +a² = -2a² = -2 => -2a² = -2 => a²=1 => a=1 or a=-1.\n\nHence, the solutions are (1,0,-1) and (-1,0,1). Which matches our previous findings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two triples.\n\n**Final Answer", "answer": "Porównując lewe strony pierwszego i drugiego równania otrzymujemy  \n\\[ a^2 + 4ab = 4bc + c^2, \\]  \nskąd  \n\\[ 0 = a^2 - c^2 + 4ab - 4bc = (a - c)(a + c + 4b). \\]  \n\nJeśli \\( a - c = 0 \\), to \\( a = c \\) i trzecie równanie przyjmuje postać \\( 6a^2 = -2 \\).  \nTo jest sprzeczność, bo kwadrat liczby rzeczywistej nie może być ujemny.  \nW takim razie \\( a - c \\neq 0 \\), wobec czego \\( a + c + 4b = 0 \\).  \n\nZ drugiej strony, dodając stronami wszystkie trzy równania dostajemy  \n\\[ 2(a + b + c)^2 = 0, \\]  \nskąd \\( a + b + c = 0 \\).  \n\nOtrzymane związki dają \\( 3b = (a + c + 4b) - (a + b + c) = 0 \\),  \nwięc \\( b = 0 \\).

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me start by understanding the requirements better.\n\nFirst, the chessboard is infinite, so we need a way to tile or arrange numbers such that no matter where you place an m x n or n x m rectangle, it contains all the numbers from 1 to mn exactly once. That seems like a kind of Latin square concept but extended to two dimensions. Latin squares have each number appearing once per row and column, but here it's more like a gerechte design or a Sudoku puzzle, where regions of a certain size must contain all numbers.\n\nBut since the chessboard is infinite, we can't just use a finite grid. Instead, we need a periodic arrangement where the pattern repeats in such a way that every possible rectangle of size m x n or n x m must contain all the numbers. So maybe the key is to find m and n such that the numbers can be arranged periodically with periods m and n in one direction and n and m in the other.\n\nLet me think. If m and n are coprime, maybe that helps? Or perhaps if they are equal? Let's test small values.\n\nStarting with m = 1 and n = 1. Then A = {1}, and the 1x1 rectangle (which is just a single cell) must contain 1. That works trivially. So (1,1) is a solution.\n\nNext, m = 1 and n = 2. Then A = {1,2}. We need to arrange numbers in the infinite chessboard such that every 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle contains both numbers. Since it's 1x2, the rectangle is just two adjacent cells. So we need to alternate 1 and 2 in some pattern. For example, 1,2,1,2,... in rows. Then any 1x2 rectangle will have 1 and 2. Similarly, 2x1 rectangles (columns) will also have 1 and 2. So (1,2) and (2,1) are solutions.\n\nMoving on to m = 2 and n = 2. A = {1,2,3,4}. We need every 2x2 or 2x2 rectangle (since m = n here) to contain all four numbers. This is similar to a Sudoku puzzle but on an infinite grid. How can we arrange numbers 1-4 in a 2x2 repeating pattern? For example, using a cyclic pattern:\n\n1 2\n3 4\n\nThen repeating this pattern. Let's check. In any 2x2 block, you get all numbers. But wait, if we tile this pattern, then any 2x2 rectangle starting at any position will have the same numbers. However, the problem states that the chessboard is infinite, so even if we have a repeating pattern, every possible 2x2 rectangle must contain all numbers. Let me check:\n\nTake the standard 2x2 tile:\n\n1 2\n3 4\n\nIf we repeat this, the next block would be:\n\n1 2\n3 4\n\nBut then the overlapping regions... Wait, actually, in an infinite grid, if we tile this pattern, then any 2x2 square will be exactly the tile. But in reality, the 2x2 tiles are adjacent. For example, the first two rows and columns would have:\n\n1 2 1 2...\n3 4 3 4...\n1 2 1 2...\n3 4 3 4...\n\nSo, if you take a 2x2 square starting at (1,1), you get 1,2,3,4. Starting at (1,2), you get 2,1,4,3. Starting at (2,1), you get 3,4,1,2. Starting at (2,2), you get 4,3,2,1. So all possible 2x2 rectangles do contain all four numbers. Similarly, any 2x2 rectangle in the infinite grid will be a shifted version of the tile, hence containing all numbers. So (2,2) is a solution.\n\nWait, but what about m=2 and n=3? Let's see. A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. We need every 2x3 or 3x2 rectangle to contain all six numbers. How can we arrange this? Maybe using a similar approach as Latin squares. If we can find a way to arrange numbers such that each row is a permutation shifted appropriately, and each column as well. For example, a grid where each row is a shifted version of the previous one. Let's try:\n\nRow 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, ...\nRow 2: 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\nRow 3: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, ...\nWait, but this might not cover all numbers in a 2x3 rectangle. Let me check a specific rectangle. Take rows 1 and 2, columns 1-3:\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n\nThat's good. Columns 4-6 in rows 1-2:\n\n4 5 6\n1 2 3\n\nAlso good. But a rectangle spanning rows 1-2 and columns 1-3 would have 1,2,3,4,5,6. Another rectangle starting at row 1, column 2: 2,3,5,6,1,2 – wait, that's 2,3,5,6,1,2. But 2 is repeated, and missing 4. So that's a problem. So this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe a different approach is needed. Maybe a toroidal grid where the numbers wrap around? For example, in a 2x3 grid, each number appears once, but since the grid is infinite, the pattern repeats. However, ensuring that every 2x3 or 3x2 window has all numbers is tricky. Maybe if m and n are coprime, it's possible? Wait, 2 and 3 are coprime. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a torus with dimensions m x n. If m and n are coprime, then a toroidal Latin square exists. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is related to the concept of \"grids with orthogonal Latin squares\" but extended.\n\nWait, another thought: for the grid to satisfy that every m x n rectangle contains all numbers from 1 to mn, the arrangement must be such that in every direction, the numbers are spaced appropriately. So, if we can create a grid where moving m steps in one direction and n steps in the other direction cycles through all numbers without repetition. That sounds like a modular arithmetic approach.\n\nFor example, if we assign to each cell (i, j) the number (i + k*j) mod mn, for some k. But since we need numbers from 1 to mn, maybe (i + k*j) mod mn, then add 1. But we need to ensure that in every m x n rectangle, all residues 0 to mn-1 occur exactly once. Wait, but modulus would cause repetitions unless the step is co-prime with mn.\n\nAlternatively, using a two-dimensional numbering like (i mod m, j mod n) but combined in such a way that each pair (i mod m, j mod n) corresponds to a unique number. Wait, but mn numbers are needed, so perhaps a bijection between the grid and mn elements. For example, using a pairing function, like Cantor's enumeration, but arranged periodically.\n\nWait, actually, this seems related to the concept of \"grids with modular coordinates\". For example, if we can define a numbering scheme where each cell (i, j) is assigned a number based on (i mod m, j mod n) or something similar, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, another idea: if m and n are coprime, then the grid can be tiled with m x n blocks each containing all numbers 1 to mn. But if m and n are not coprime, the blocks would overlap in such a way that numbers might repeat in some rectangles. Hmm, but in the problem, the requirement is that every m x n or n x m rectangle contains all numbers, not just that the entire grid is partitioned into blocks.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that m and n must be such that the grid can be filled with a toroidal design where the periods are m and n, and the combination of these periods ensures that every possible rectangle of size m x n or n x m contains all numbers. For this to happen, the periods m and n must be such that the grid is a \"complete\" design, meaning that the shifts don't cause overlaps or missing numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if m and n are both 1, it's trivial. If one is 1 and the other is any number, then it's possible by tiling with the numbers in a repeating sequence. For example, m=1, n=k: the grid is just rows of 1,2,...,k,1,2,... So any 1xk or kx1 rectangle will contain all numbers. Similarly for n=1, m=k.\n\nBut when both m and n are greater than 1, we need a more complex arrangement. The case m=2, n=2 worked because the 2x2 blocks can be arranged to tile the plane without overlapping, and every 2x2 block is a permutation of 1-4. But for m=2, n=3, as before, arranging numbers such that every 2x3 or 3x2 block has all 6 numbers is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe m and n need to be such that they are both prime? Or co-prime? Let's test m=2, n=3. If they are coprime, maybe there's a way. But as we saw earlier, creating such a grid is not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the only solutions are when m = n? But m=2, n=2 worked, let's check m=3, n=3. Then A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. We need every 3x3 or 3x3 rectangle to contain all numbers. If we tile a 3x3 grid with numbers 1-9, repeating, then similar to the 2x2 case, any 3x3 window would be the original tile or a shifted version, hence containing all numbers. So (3,3) would work. But would it?\n\nWait, actually, if you tile a 3x3 block with numbers 1-9, then shifting the window by 1 row or column would overlap with the next block. For example, the first three rows and columns would be the original block, the next block would start at row 2, column 2, etc. But in that case, a 3x3 window starting at (1,1) has all numbers, but a starting at (2,2) would overlap with the next block. Wait, no, in a 3x3 tiling, the grid is divided into 3x3 blocks each with numbers 1-9. Then, any 3x3 rectangle that starts within a block will have all numbers, but a rectangle that crosses block boundaries would overlap multiple blocks. For example, a rectangle starting at (1,1) to (3,3) is one block. But a rectangle starting at (1,2) to (3,4) would include parts of two blocks. However, in reality, since the numbers are repeated every 3 rows and 3 columns, the numbers in such a rectangle would not necessarily be unique. Wait, but if the tiling is such that each number appears exactly once in each 3x3 block, then overlapping regions would have numbers from different blocks. But in reality, the numbers are only in the block they were assigned to. Wait, no, if you tile the grid with a 3x3 block, then each cell's number is fixed. So, for example, cell (4,4) would have the same number as (1,1). Therefore, a rectangle that spans multiple blocks would include multiple copies of numbers from different blocks, which would repeat numbers. Hence, such a tiling wouldn't satisfy the condition.\n\nOh, right! If we tile the grid with a 3x3 block, then any rectangle that crosses block boundaries will include numbers from multiple tiles, which would mean that numbers repeat. For example, a 3x3 rectangle starting at (1,1) has numbers 1-9, but a rectangle starting at (2,2) would have numbers from the next block, which are also 1-9, so numbers would repeat. Hence, this tiling doesn't work. Therefore, my initial thought was wrong.\n\nSo, tiling with blocks doesn't work because overlapping regions would repeat numbers. So, the arrangement has to be such that the numbers are arranged in a way that every m x n or n x m window contains all numbers, without repeating. This seems similar to a covering design or a super-saturated design.\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. For each possible m x n or n x m window, all numbers 1 to mn must appear exactly once. So, the arrangement must be such that it's a Latin square in both row and column directions, but extended to two dimensions. Maybe this is called a \"hypercyclic\" Latin square or something similar.\n\nWait, but in two dimensions, a Latin square ensures each symbol appears once per row and column. Here, we need each symbol to appear once per m x n or n x m window. That's a much stronger condition. It's similar to a Sudoku puzzle but with rectangular regions of size m x n. In Sudoku, the regions are 3x3, but here, the regions can be any size. However, Sudoku is possible only for certain region sizes.\n\nIn Sudoku literature, it's known that a Sudoku puzzle (a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 regions) can be solved. But here, the regions are m x n, and the grid is infinite. So perhaps the problem is related to tiling the infinite grid with regions of size m x n such that each region contains all numbers 1 to mn, and any m x n window is exactly one such region? But the problem states that the chessboard is infinite, so we can't have finite regions. Therefore, the arrangement must be such that the numbers are arranged periodically with periods m and n in both directions, and the combination of these periods ensures that every window of size m x n or n x m contains all numbers.\n\nThis seems analogous to a toroidal grid where the grid is finite but repeats infinitely. For example, if the grid is designed such that moving m steps in one direction and n steps in the other direction cycles through", "answer": "y mod n = y' mod n oraz (x - y) mod m = (x' - y') mod m.\n\nTo zaś jest równoważne temu, że n dzieli liczbę y − y′ oraz m dzieli liczbę x − y − (x′ − y′) = (x − x′) − (y − y′).\n\nWykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt m × n przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że jeśli |x − x′| < m, |y − y′| < n i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′), to x = x′ i y = y′. Na mocy obserwacji poczynionej powyżej, liczba y − y′ dzieli się przez n, a liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) dzieli się przez m. Jedyną liczbą o module mniejszym od n podzielną przez n jest 0 — zatem y−y′ = 0. Wtedy (x−x′)−(y−y′) = x−x′ jest podzielną przez m liczbą o module mniejszym od m — zatem x−x′ = 0. Ostatecznie x = x′ i y = y′.\n\nTeraz wykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt n × m przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że z warunków |x − x′| < n, |y − y′| < m i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′) wynika, że x = x′ i y = y′. Analogicznie jak wyżej stwierdzamy, że y−y′ dzieli się przez n oraz że (x−x′)−(y−y′) dzieli się przez m. Liczba m dzieli się przez n, więc n dzieli liczbę (x−x′)−(y−y′), a skoro n dzieli y − y′, to musi też dzielić x − x′. Ponieważ x − x′ jest podzielna przez n liczbą o module mniejszym od n, więc x − x′ = 0. Stąd wniosek, że liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) jest równa y′ − y. Jest ona podzielna przez m i ma moduł mniejszy od m, więc y′ − y = 0. Otrzymaliśmy zatem x = x′ i y = y′."}

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the question is asking whether there are infinitely many numbers that can't be expressed in the form of a square plus a prime. So, for some number m, there's no way to find an integer n and a prime p such that m = n² + p. And we need to determine if such numbers exist infinitely.\n\nLet me think about how numbers can be written as n² + p. For any prime p, if we subtract it from a number m, we might get a square. So, m - p should be a perfect square. So, for m to be expressible as n² + p, there must exist a prime p such that m - p is a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, if m cannot be written as n² + p, that means for all primes p, m - p is not a perfect square. So, for such m, m - k² is not prime for any square k² less than m. Wait, no, actually, m - p = k² implies p = m - k². So, if m - k² is prime for some k, then m can be expressed as n² + p. Therefore, m cannot be expressed in that form if for all k such that k² < m, m - k² is not prime.\n\nTherefore, m must satisfy that m - k² is composite for all k with k² < m. So, m must be such that when you subtract any square less than m, the result is composite. So, how can such numbers m exist? Maybe numbers that are one more than a square? Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers that are even and large enough? Because primes (except 2) are odd, so if n² is even (i.e., n is even), then n² + p is even + odd = odd. If n is odd, then n² is odd, so odd + prime (if p is 2, which is the only even prime) would be odd + even = odd. Wait, so n² + p can be even or odd depending on p. For example, if n is even and p is 2, then n² + 2 is even. If n is odd and p is 2, then n² + 2 is odd + even = odd. So, the parity can vary. So maybe even numbers can't be expressed as n² + 2? Wait, if m is even, then m - p must be a square. If p is 2, then m - 2 must be a square. So, even numbers m can be written as n² + 2 if m - 2 is a square. Similarly, for other primes.\n\nBut maybe even numbers can't be expressed as n² + p for some primes. For example, take m = 2. Then 2 can be written as 1² + 1, but 1 is not prime. Wait, 1 is not considered a prime. So, 2 cannot be written as n² + p. Wait, 2 is 1 + 1, but 1 isn't prime. 2 is also 0² + 2, but 0 is not a positive integer, and n is supposed to be an integer, but 0 is allowed? The problem says \"nieskonczone liczby całkowitych\" which translates to \"infinitely many positive integers\". So n is an integer, but does it have to be positive? The problem statement in Polish says \"nieskonczone liczby całkowitych\" which is \"infinite number of integers\" but since it's specified as \"dodatnich\", which means positive, so n must be a positive integer. So n ≥ 1, and p is a prime (at least 2). So, m = n² + p ≥ 1 + 2 = 3. But 2 cannot be expressed as n² + p with n ≥ 1 and p ≥ 2. So 2 is a candidate. Similarly, 3 can be written as 1² + 2, which is 1 + 2 = 3. So 3 is okay. 4: 1² + 3 = 4, but 3 is prime. So 4 is okay. 5: 2² + 1, but 1 isn't prime. 5 can also be 1² + 4, but 4 isn't prime. 5 = 0² + 5, but n must be positive. So 5 can't be written as n² + p. Wait, but 5 = 2² + 1, but 1 isn't prime. So 5 can't be expressed as n² + p. So 5 is another candidate. So maybe primes themselves can't be expressed? But primes can be written as themselves minus a square. Wait, for example, 5 = 2² + 1, but 1 isn't prime. So 5 can't be written as n² + p. Similarly, 7: 7 = 2² + 3, which works. So 7 can be written. 11: 11 = 3² + 2, so yes. So some primes can be written as n² + p, but others cannot.\n\nWait, but the question is not about primes, but about numbers that cannot be written as n² + p. So, 2 and 5 are examples. Let's check 2: n must be at least 1, so n=1: 1 + p = 2 ⇒ p=1, which is not prime. n=0: 0 + p = 2 ⇒ p=2, but n must be positive. So 2 cannot be written as n² + p. Similarly, 5: n=1: 1 + p =5 ⇒ p=4, not prime. n=2: 4 + p =5 ⇒ p=1, not prime. So 5 cannot be written. 10: Let's see. n=3: 9 + p=10 ⇒ p=1, not prime. n=2: 4 + p=10 ⇒ p=6, not prime. n=1: 1 + p=10 ⇒ p=9, not prime. n=0: 0 + p=10 ⇒ p=10, not prime. So 10 also cannot be written. So 2,5,10 are examples. Are there infinitely many such numbers?\n\nThe question is whether there are infinitely many numbers that cannot be expressed in this form. So maybe numbers that are 2 less than a prime? Wait, not exactly. For example, 2 is 3 - 1, but 3 is prime. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe numbers that are 1 mod 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider numbers that are 2 mod 4. Let's see. If m ≡ 2 mod 4, then m - 2 ≡ 0 mod 4. So if m is 2 mod 4, then m - 2 is divisible by 4. So if m is 2 mod 4, then m can be written as n² + p only if p ≡ m - n² mod 4. But primes (except 2) are either 1 or 3 mod 4. So if m is 2 mod 4, then m - n² must be 2 or 0 mod 4. If n is even, n² ≡ 0 mod 4, so m - 0 ≡ 2 mod 4 ⇒ m ≡ 2 mod 4. Then p must be 2 mod 4, but the only prime that is 2 mod 4 is 2 itself. So if m ≡ 2 mod 4, then m - n² must be 2. So n² = m - 2. So if m - 2 is a square, then m can be written as n² + 2. But primes greater than 2 are odd, so m would have to be odd + even = odd. Wait, m ≡ 2 mod 4 is even, so m must be even. But if m is even and m ≡ 2 mod 4, then m is even but not divisible by 4. So m = 4k + 2. Then m - 2 = 4k, which is divisible by 4. So if m = 4k + 2, then m - 2 = 4k. So to write m as n² + p, we would need p = m - n². If n is even, n² ≡ 0 mod 4, so p ≡ 2 mod 4. But the only prime that is 2 mod 4 is 2. So p must be 2. Then m - n² = 2 ⇒ n² = m - 2. So if m - 2 is a perfect square, then m can be written as n² + 2. But m = 4k + 2, so m - 2 = 4k. So 4k must be a perfect square. Therefore, k must be a perfect square. So if m = 4k² + 2, then m can be written as (2k)² + 2. So numbers of the form 4k² + 2 can be written as n² + p. But numbers of the form 4k + 2 that are not 4k² + 2 cannot? Wait, let's take m = 6. 6 ≡ 2 mod 4. Then m - 2 = 4, which is a square. So 6 = 2² + 2. So 6 can be written. Similarly, m=10: m - 2 = 8, which is not a square. So 10 cannot be written as n² + p. Wait, but earlier I thought 10 couldn't be written. Let's check again. 10: n=3: 9 + p=10 ⇒ p=1, not prime. n=2: 4 + p=10 ⇒ p=6, not prime. n=1: 1 + p=10 ⇒ p=9, not prime. n=0: 0 + p=10 ⇒ p=10, not prime. So 10 cannot be written. But according to the previous logic, if m = 4k + 2, then m - 2 = 4k, which is a square only if k is a square. So m = 4k² + 2. So 10 is 4*2 + 2, but 2 is not a square. Therefore, m=10 cannot be written as n² + p. Similarly, m= 4*1 + 2 = 6, which is 4*1² + 2. So 6 can be written. So numbers of the form 4k² + 2 can be written as n² + p, but numbers of the form 4k + 2 where k is not a square cannot. Therefore, there are infinitely many numbers of the form 4k + 2 where k is not a square. Since there are infinitely many k that are not squares, these numbers cannot be written as n² + p. Therefore, there are infinitely many such numbers.\n\nBut wait, this is only for numbers congruent to 2 mod 4. But there might be other numbers as well. For example, numbers that are 3 mod 4. Let's take m=3. 3 can be written as 1² + 2. So that works. m=7: 2² + 3 = 7. So that works. m=11: 3² + 2 = 11. So that works. So numbers that are 3 mod 4 can sometimes be written as n² + p. Similarly, numbers that are 1 mod 4. For example, m=5: 1² + 4 (but 4 isn't prime). 2² + 1 (1 not prime). So m=5 can't be written. But 5 is 1 mod 4. Wait, 5 ≡ 1 mod 4. So maybe numbers that are 1 mod 4 can also be problematic. Let me check m=5, 13, 17, etc.\n\nTake m=5: as before, can't be written. m=13: 3² + 4 (4 not prime), 2² + 9 (9 not prime), 1² + 12 (12 not prime), 0² +13 (13 is prime, but n must be positive). So 13 can't be written. Wait, 13 is prime, so if m is prime, can m be written as n² + p? If p is another prime, then m - p must be a square. So for m=13, 13 - p must be a square. So primes p such that 13 - p is a square. The squares less than 13 are 1,4,9. So 13 - p = 1 ⇒ p=12 (not prime), 13 - p=4 ⇒ p=9 (not prime), 13 - p=9 ⇒ p=4 (not prime). So 13 cannot be written as n² + p. Similarly, m=17: 17 - p must be a square. 17 - p =1,4,9. p=16,13,8. 16 and 8 not prime, 13 is prime. So 17 -13=4, which is a square. So 17=2² + 13. So 17 can be written. So m=17 can be written. So primes like 17 can be written, but others like 5,13 cannot. So there are primes that can be written as n² + p, and primes that cannot. Similarly, composite numbers like 10, 2,5 cannot be written.\n\nSo, the key seems to be numbers that cannot be expressed as n² + p. To show there are infinitely many, perhaps we can find an infinite set of numbers where for each number m, m - k² is not prime for any square k² < m.\n\nEarlier, we considered numbers congruent to 2 mod 4. For such numbers m = 4k + 2, if m - 2 is not a square, then m cannot be written as n² + p. Because if m - p is a square, then p = m - k². Since m ≡ 2 mod 4, m - k² ≡ 2 - k² mod 4. If k is even, k² ≡ 0 mod 4, so p ≡ 2 mod 4, which would", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że dla dowolnej nieparzystej liczby \\(a \\geq 3\\) liczby \\(\\left(\\frac{3a+1}{2}\\right)^2\\) nie można przedstawić w żądanej postaci.

A cycle is defined as a closed broken line made from at least three different marked chords. Two cycles are considered the same if they are composed of the same set of chords. It's given that there's a cycle C made up of 2022 chords, such that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. We need to find the largest possible number of such cycles.\n\nHmm, first, let me parse the problem again. The key points are:\n\n1. The circle has some number of marked chords (the exact number isn't given, but maybe it's not necessary? Or maybe it's implied that the number of chords is whatever is needed to form the cycles. Wait, no, the problem is about finding the maximum number of cycles given that there exists a cycle C with 2022 chords such that every cycle shares at least one chord with C.)\n\n2. A cycle is a closed broken line made of at least three different chords. So, each cycle is a set of chords that form a closed loop. Each chord is part of exactly two cycles (since it's a closed broken line), but in this problem, we are considering cycles as sets of chords, not paths.\n\n3. Two cycles are the same if they consist of the same set of chords. So, the cycles are determined by their chord sets.\n\n4. There exists a cycle C with 2022 chords, such that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, C is like a \"hitting set\" for all the cycles; every cycle must include at least one chord from C.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of cycles under these conditions.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of the cycles. Each cycle is a closed broken line made of at least three chords. Since it's a closed broken line, the chords must connect in sequence, forming a polygon-like structure, but on a circle. So, each cycle is a polygon where each side is a chord of the circle. However, chords can intersect each other inside the circle, but the broken line must be closed.\n\nWait, but on a circle, if you have chords, the only way to form a closed broken line is if the chords form a polygon. But chords in a circle can intersect, but the broken line is a sequence of connected chords. So, for example, if you have a triangle where each side is a chord, then connecting three chords end to end forms a triangle. Similarly, a quadrilateral would be four chords connected in a chain, forming a closed loop.\n\nBut in a circle, the chords can be arranged such that the broken line doesn't cross itself? Or can it? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that the broken line has to be simple, just a closed broken line. So, chords can cross each other as long as the sequence connects them.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that each cycle is a set of chords that form a closed loop when connected end-to-end. So, each cycle is essentially a polygon, but the edges are chords of the circle.\n\nBut in a circle with n points, the number of chords is C(n,2). But here, we are dealing with a circle with some number of marked chords. The problem doesn't specify the number of points on the circle, just the number of chords. Hmm, so maybe the number of points is variable, but we need to find the maximum number of cycles given the constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is similar to hypergraphs, where each hyperedge is a cycle (a set of chords forming a closed loop), and we need to find the maximum number of hyperedges such that there exists a hitting set (the cycle C with 2022 chords) that intersects every hyperedge.\n\nBut in hypergraph terminology, we have a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a cycle (a set of chords forming a closed broken line), and we need to find the maximum number of hyperedges such that there exists a hyperedge (cycle C) that intersects every other hyperedge. Then, the question is to find the maximum possible number of hyperedges under these conditions.\n\nBut hypergraph theory might not directly help here. Let's think combinatorially.\n\nFirst, note that the cycle C with 2022 chords is fixed. Every other cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, all cycles are subsets of the chords that include at least one chord from C. But cycles themselves are sets of chords that form a closed broken line. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible cycles that include at least one chord from C, given that C is a cycle of 2022 chords.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because even if a cycle shares a chord with C, the rest of its chords might not be part of C. However, the problem states that every cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, cycles can be any closed broken line (any set of chords forming a cycle), but they must include at least one chord that is part of the specific cycle C (which has 2022 chords).\n\nTherefore, our task is to find the maximum number of cycles (as sets of chords) such that each cycle includes at least one chord from the fixed set C of 2022 chords, and all cycles are closed broken lines (i.e., each cycle is a set of chords forming a closed loop).\n\nSo, how can we model this? Let's consider that each cycle is a set of chords forming a closed loop. Each such cycle can be represented as a polygon with edges being chords. The key is that these polygons can overlap with each other, but each must include at least one chord from C.\n\nTo maximize the number of such cycles, we need to arrange the chords in such a way that as many cycles as possible can be formed, each sharing at least one chord with C. The challenge is to arrange the chords (possibly in a way that allows many overlapping cycles) such that the number of cycles is maximized.\n\nBut the problem is that adding more chords might allow more cycles, but each new chord can be part of multiple cycles. However, we need to ensure that every cycle includes at least one chord from C. So, if we have a set of chords where every cycle (closed broken line) includes at least one chord from C, then the number of cycles is maximized when we have as many cycles as possible under this constraint.\n\nThis seems similar to a covering problem, where C is a hitting set for all cycles. The goal is to have the largest possible hitting set C (size 2022) such that every cycle is hit by C. Wait, but the problem states that C is a cycle of 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, actually, C is a hitting set for all cycles except itself. But since cycles can include chords from C, but must share at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, but C itself is a cycle. So, does C need to share a chord with itself? No, because the problem says \"every cykl has at least one common chord with cykl C\". So, C is not counted among the other cycles. So, all other cycles (i.e., every cycle different from C) must share at least one chord with C.\n\nTherefore, the problem is: given a cycle C with 2022 chords, such that every other cycle (i.e., every other closed broken line made of chords) shares at least one chord with C. We need to find the maximum possible number of cycles under this condition.\n\nSo, how can we model this? Let's think of the chords not in C as additional chords that can be used to form cycles. However, any cycle formed must include at least one chord from C. So, cycles can be formed either by using only chords from C, or by combining chords from C with chords not in C, but must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut since we want to maximize the number of cycles, we need to arrange the chords (both in C and outside C) such that as many cycles as possible can be formed, each including at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how to maximize this? Let's consider that each cycle is a closed broken line. Each such cycle is a set of chords forming a closed loop. So, each cycle is a polygon, possibly with intersecting chords, but the sequence of chords must form a closed path.\n\nBut cycles can overlap. For example, if we have a chord in C, we can form a cycle around it by adding other chords. However, each time we add another chord, we might create multiple cycles.\n\nWait, but cycles are defined as closed broken lines made from at least three chords. So, each cycle is a set of three or more chords connected end-to-end. So, each cycle is a polygon, possibly with intersecting chords, but the chords are connected in a sequence.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that each cycle must include at least one chord from C. So, all cycles are either:\n\n1. Cycles that are entirely within C (i.e., cycles formed solely by chords in C).\n\n2. Cycles that include at least one chord from outside C but must include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut since we want to maximize the number of cycles, we need to maximize both types. However, cycles formed entirely within C are limited by the structure of C itself. If C is a single polygon (a convex polygon, for example), then the number of cycles within C would be the number of sub-polygons that can be formed by dividing C into smaller polygons. But if C is a single polygon, then any cycle within C would require a subset of chords that form a closed loop. However, in a convex polygon, any subset of chords that form a closed loop must be the chords of a convex polygon with fewer sides. But in that case, the number of such cycles would be limited.\n\nAlternatively, if C is a highly connected chord set, allowing for many sub-cycles. For example, if the chords in C form a complete graph, then there could be many cycles within C. However, the problem states that C is a cycle itself, so it's a single closed broken line. Therefore, C is a single cycle, but other cycles can share chords with C but may also include other chords.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify that the cycles are simple or not. They can be complex, as long as they form a closed broken line. So, for example, a cycle could go back and forth across the circle, using multiple chords. However, each chord is part of exactly two cycles (since it's part of a closed broken line). Wait, no, in a cycle as a set of chords, each chord is part of exactly one cycle. Wait, no, if you have a broken line, each chord is an edge in the path. But since it's a closed broken line, the number of edges is equal to the number of chords. Each chord is part of exactly one cycle (the closed broken line). So, each cycle is a set of chords forming a closed loop, with no overlapping chords.\n\nTherefore, each cycle is a simple closed broken line, with distinct chords. So, two different cycles can share a chord, but each cycle is a set of chords.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: given a set C of 2022 chords forming a closed broken line (cycle), find the maximum number of other cycles (each a set of chords forming a closed broken line) such that each of these cycles shares at least one chord with C.\n\nOur task is to find the maximum possible number of such cycles.\n\nTo maximize the number of cycles, we need as many as possible closed broken lines (sets of chords) that each include at least one chord from C. The challenge is to arrange the chords in such a way that this condition is satisfied, while allowing for as many cycles as possible.\n\nBut how can we arrange the chords? The problem doesn't specify the number of points on the circle. So, perhaps the number of points is variable, but we need to maximize the number of cycles given that there exists a cycle C with 2022 chords. Wait, but the number of points on the circle affects the number of possible chords. For example, with n points, there are C(n,2) chords. If we have too few points, the number of possible chords is limited, hence cycles would be limited. If we have more points, more chords are possible. However, since we need to include a cycle C with 2022 chords, which requires n to be at least 2022 (since each chord is between two points, and a cycle requires at least three chords). Wait, but in a cycle, you need at least three chords forming a triangle. Wait, no, a cycle in graph theory is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating edges. But here, a cycle is a closed broken line made of chords, which can intersect each other. So, it's a more general closed path.\n\nBut in terms of chords, a cycle must consist of a sequence of distinct chords where each consecutive pair of chords intersect at a common endpoint (vertex), and the last chord connects back to the first. So, each cycle is a polygonal chain that starts and ends at the same point, using chords as edges.\n\nTherefore, to form a cycle, you need at least three chords, each sharing a common endpoint with the next, and the last chord connecting back to the first.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of chords for a cycle is three, forming a triangle. Each subsequent cycle can have more chords.\n\nBut given that C is a cycle of 2022 chords, which is a very large number, it's likely that the circle has a large number of points. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of points, so we might need to consider that the number of points is variable, and we need to choose it such that the number of cycles is maximized, given that there exists a cycle C with 2022 chords.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"okrąg\" which is a circle, and \"zazn ornąli certain number of chords\". So, the circle has a certain number of points (vertices) and chords (edges). The problem is to determine the maximum number of cycles (closed broken lines) such that each cycle shares at least one chord with the cycle C (which has 2022 chords). So, the total number of cycles is the number we need to find.\n\nBut how does the number of points relate to the number of chords? If there are n points on the circle, the number of possible chords is C(n,2). The cycle C uses 2022 chords, so n must be at least... Let's see, the number of chords in a cycle. A cycle as a closed broken line requires that each chord is connected to the next via a common endpoint. So, in graph terms, this is a cycle in the graph formed by the chords. However, in a circle, the chords can cross, but the cycle as a closed broken line doesn't require the chords to be non-crossing.\n\nBut each chord in the cycle must connect two points, and consecutive chords share a common endpoint. So, the cycle is a closed walk in the graph where each edge is a chord, and the walk visits each edge at most once (since it's a closed broken line). Therefore, the cycle is a closed walk that forms a polygonal path, visiting each chord (edge) exactly once.\n\nWait, but in graph theory, a cycle is a closed", "answer": "Dla każdego cyklu \\( A \\) będziemy oznaczać przez \\( f(A) \\) zbiór wspólnych cięciw cykli \\( A \\) i \\( C \\).

Hmm, quadratic function, so it has the form f(t) = at² + bt + c for some constants a, b, c. The problem is asking me to express f(x + y + z) in terms of x, y, z. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try to determine the coefficients a, b, c of the quadratic function. Since f is quadratic, we can set up equations based on the given values. Let's write down the three equations:\n\n1. f(x) = a x² + b x + c = y z\n2. f(y) = a y² + b y + c = z x\n3. f(z) = a z² + b z + c = x y\n\nSo we have three equations with three unknowns: a, b, c. If I can solve for a, b, c, then I can write f(t) explicitly and then compute f(x + y + z).\n\nBut solving this system might be tricky. Let's see. Let me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(a y² + b y + c) - (a x² + b x + c) = z x - y z\n\nSimplify left side: a(y² - x²) + b(y - x) = z(x - y)\n\nFactor left side: a(y - x)(y + x) + b(y - x) = z(x - y)\n\nFactor out (y - x):\n\n(y - x)(a(y + x) + b) = z(x - y)\n\nNote that (x - y) = - (y - x), so:\n\n(y - x)(a(y + x) + b) = - z(y - x)\n\nAssuming y ≠ x (since x, y, z are pairwise distinct), we can divide both sides by (y - x):\n\na(y + x) + b = -z\n\nSo, equation (4): a(y + x) + b = -z\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second equation from the third:\n\n(a z² + b z + c) - (a y² + b y + c) = x y - z x\n\nLeft side: a(z² - y²) + b(z - y) = x(y - z)\n\nFactor left side: a(z - y)(z + y) + b(z - y) = x(y - z)\n\nFactor out (z - y):\n\n(z - y)(a(z + y) + b) = x(y - z)\n\nAgain, (y - z) = - (z - y), so:\n\n(z - y)(a(z + y) + b) = -x(z - y)\n\nAssuming z ≠ y, divide both sides by (z - y):\n\na(z + y) + b = -x\n\nSimilarly, subtract the first equation from the third:\n\n(a z² + b z + c) - (a x² + b x + c) = x y - y z\n\nLeft side: a(z² - x²) + b(z - x) = y(x - z)\n\nFactor left side: a(z - x)(z + x) + b(z - x) = y(x - z)\n\nFactor out (z - x):\n\n(z - x)(a(z + x) + b) = y(x - z)\n\nWhich is (z - x)(a(z + x) + b) = - y(z - x)\n\nAssuming z ≠ x, divide both sides by (z - x):\n\na(z + x) + b = - y\n\nSo now, from the three subtractions, we get three equations:\n\n1. a(y + x) + b = -z (from 1st - 2nd)\n2. a(z + y) + b = -x (from 2nd - 3rd)\n3. a(z + x) + b = -y (from 1st - 3rd)\n\nNow, let's write these three equations:\n\n(4): a(x + y) + b = -z\n\n(5): a(y + z) + b = -x\n\n(6): a(z + x) + b = -y\n\nHmm, maybe subtract equation (4) from equation (5):\n\n[a(y + z) + b] - [a(x + y) + b] = -x - (-z)\n\nSimplify left side: a(z - x) = -x + z\n\nFactor right side: z - x\n\nSo, a(z - x) = z - x\n\nAssuming z ≠ x (which they are, since x, y, z are pairwise distinct), we can divide both sides by (z - x):\n\na = 1\n\nSo a = 1. Then, substitute a = 1 into equation (4):\n\n1*(x + y) + b = -z → x + y + b = -z → b = -z - x - y\n\nSimilarly, check with equation (5):\n\n1*(y + z) + b = -x → y + z + b = -x → b = -x - y - z\n\nSame result. Similarly, equation (6):\n\n1*(z + x) + b = -y → z + x + b = -y → b = -x - y - z\n\nSo consistent. Therefore, a = 1, b = - (x + y + z)\n\nNow, we need to find c. Let's use one of the original equations, say the first one:\n\nf(x) = a x² + b x + c = y z\n\nWe know a = 1, b = - (x + y + z), so:\n\nx² - (x + y + z)x + c = y z\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nx² - x² - x y - x z + c = y z\n\nSimplify:\n\n- x y - x z + c = y z\n\nThus:\n\nc = y z + x y + x z\n\nSo c = xy + yz + zx\n\nTherefore, the quadratic function is:\n\nf(t) = t² - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx)\n\nWait a second, that looks familiar. If we expand (t - x)(t - y)(t - z), but no, that's cubic. Wait, but f(t) is quadratic, so maybe (t - x)(t - y) + (something). Wait, but our f(t) is t² - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx). That is actually equal to (t - x)(t - y) + z(t - x - y). Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the expression t² - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx) is equal to (t - x)(t - y) + z(t - x - y). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f(t) can be written as (t - x)(t - y) + z(t - x - y) + ... Hmm, maybe not necessary. Let's just proceed.\n\nSo f(t) = t² - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx). Let's check if this satisfies the given conditions.\n\nCheck f(x):\n\nx² - (x + y + z)x + (xy + yz + zx) = x² - x² - x y - x z + xy + yz + zx = (-xy -xz) + xy + yz + zx = yz. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, f(y) = y² - (x + y + z)y + (xy + yz + zx) = y² - xy - y² - y z + xy + y z + x z = (-xy - y z) + xy + y z + x z = x z. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, f(z) = z² - (x + y + z)z + (xy + y z + zx) = z² - x z - y z - z² + xy + y z + x z = (-x z - y z) + x z + y z + x y = x y. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the quadratic function is correctly determined. So f(t) = t² - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx). Therefore, to compute f(x + y + z), substitute t = x + y + z into this expression.\n\nCompute f(x + y + z):\n\n= (x + y + z)² - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx\n\nSecond term: -(x + y + z)(x + y + z) = - (x + y + z)² = -x² - y² - z² - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx\n\nThird term: xy + yz + zx\n\nSo adding them all together:\n\n[x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx] + [-x² - y² - z² - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx] + [xy + yz + zx]\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\nx² - x² + y² - y² + z² - z² + 2xy - 2xy + 2yz - 2yz + 2zx - 2zx + xy + yz + zx\n\nEverything cancels except:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + xy + yz + zx\n\nSo f(x + y + z) = xy + yz + zx\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the value of f at x + y + z is just the sum of the pairwise products of x, y, z. So the answer is xy + yz + zx. \n\nBut let me verify once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.\n\nCompute f(x + y + z):\n\n= (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx)\n\n= (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)^2 + (xy + yz + zx)\n\n= 0 + (xy + yz + zx)\n\nYes, exactly. So the first two terms cancel each other out, leaving only the third term. Therefore, f(x + y + z) = xy + yz + zx.\n\nSo the answer should be xy + yz + zx, which can be written as \\boxed{xy + yz + zx}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{xy + yz + zx}\n</think>\n\nGiven a quadratic function \\( f \\) and pairwise distinct real numbers \\( x, y, z \\) such that:\n\\[\nf(x) = yz, \\quad f(y) = zx, \\quad f(z) = xy,\n\\]\nwe need to express \\( f(x + y + z) \\) in terms of \\( x, y, z \\).\n\nFirst, we determine the coefficients \\( a, b, c \\) of the quadratic function \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\). By subtracting the given equations pairwise and solving the resulting system, we find:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -(x + y + z) \\)\n- \\( c = xy + yz + zx \\)\n\nThus, the quadratic function is:\n\\[\nf(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\( f(x + y + z) \\):\n\\[\nf(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\\[\n(x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)^2 + (xy + yz + zx) = 0 + (xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{xy + yz + zx}\n\\]", "answer": "Funkcja \\( f \\) jest dana wzorem \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) dla pewnych liczb rzeczywistych \\( a, b, c \\).

The equations are:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n2. ac + bd = 3\n3. ad + bc = 2\n4. a + b + c + d = 6\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated with four variables and four equations. Let me see how to approach this. Maybe I can find some symmetry or substitute variables to simplify things?\n\nFirst, the fourth equation is the sum of all variables equal to 6. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's say d = 6 - a - b - c. Then substitute this into the other equations. That might reduce the number of variables. Let me try that.\n\nSo, substitute d = 6 - a - b - c into equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n1. ab + c(6 - a - b - c) = 6\n2. a c + b(6 - a - b - c) = 3\n3. a(6 - a - b - c) + bc = 2\n\nLet me expand these equations:\n\nFor equation 1:\nab + 6c - a c - b c - c² = 6\n\nEquation 2:\na c + 6b - a b - b² - b c = 3\n\nEquation 3:\n6a - a² - a b - a c + b c = 2\n\nHmm, these look messy. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding equations 1, 2, 3 together. Let's see:\n\nab + cd + ac + bd + ad + bc = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n\nWait, let's compute the left side:\n\nab + cd + ac + bd + ad + bc\n\nGroup terms:\n\na(b + c + d) + b(d + c) + c(d + a) + d(a + b + c) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = (a + b + c + d)(a + b + c + d) - (a² + b² + c² + d²)/2 ?\n\nWait, actually, (a + b + c + d)² = a² + b² + c² + d² + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)\n\nSo, ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = [(a + b + c + d)² - (a² + b² + c² + d²)] / 2\n\nWe know that a + b + c + d = 6, so:\n\nab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = (36 - (a² + b² + c² + d²)) / 2\n\nBut from equations 1,2,3 added together, we have 6 + 3 + 2 = 11, so:\n\n(ab + cd) + (ac + bd) + (ad + bc) = 11\n\nWhich is equal to the sum above. So:\n\n(36 - (a² + b² + c² + d²)) / 2 = 11\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n36 - (a² + b² + c² + d²) = 22\n\nSo, a² + b² + c² + d² = 36 - 22 = 14\n\nSo now we have the sum of squares is 14. Hmm, that's a useful piece of information.\n\nBut how can I use that? Maybe if I can find another relation. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in pairs. Let me set x = a + c and y = b + d. Then since a + b + c + d = 6, x + y = 6.\n\nBut maybe that's not sufficient. Alternatively, set variables as pairs. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote S = a + c and T = b + d. Then S + T = 6.\n\nBut maybe not. Alternatively, think of variables as vectors or something else. Alternatively, use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equations 1,2,3. Let me write them again:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n\n2. ac + bd = 3\n\n3. ad + bc = 2\n\nHmm, these equations resemble symmetric terms. Maybe if we set variables in terms of pairs. Let's suppose that a and c are related, and b and d are related. For example, let me set a = c and b = d. Let's see if that works.\n\nIf a = c and b = d, then:\n\nEquation 1: ab + ab = 2ab = 6 ⇒ ab = 3\n\nEquation 2: a*a + b*b = a² + b² = 3\n\nEquation 3: a*b + b*a = 2ab = 2 ⇒ ab = 1\n\nBut from equation 1, ab = 3, but equation 3 requires ab = 1. Contradiction. So that's not possible. So a ≠ c or b ≠ d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a = d and b = c? Let's try that.\n\nSet a = d and b = c.\n\nThen:\n\nEquation 1: ab + bc = ab + bc = b(a + c) = 6\n\nEquation 2: a c + b d = a b + b a = 2ab = 3 ⇒ ab = 1.5\n\nEquation 3: a d + b c = a² + b² = 2\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c + d = a + b + b + a = 2a + 2b = 6 ⇒ a + b = 3\n\nSo from equation 3: a² + b² = 2\n\nAnd from equation 4: a + b = 3\n\nSo let's solve these two equations:\n\n(a + b)² = 9 = a² + 2ab + b² = (a² + b²) + 2ab = 2 + 2ab ⇒ 9 = 2 + 2ab ⇒ 2ab = 7 ⇒ ab = 3.5\n\nBut from equation 2, ab = 1.5. Contradiction again. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's consider variables in pairs. Let's set u = a + b and v = c + d. Then u + v = 6.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, let's consider variables as roots of a quadratic equation. Maybe a, b, c, d are roots of a quartic equation. But with four variables, that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as symmetric in some way. Let me check if there's a pattern in the coefficients.\n\nEquation 1: ab + cd = 6\n\nEquation 2: ac + bd = 3\n\nEquation 3: ad + bc = 2\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c + d = 6\n\nHmm, the coefficients in the equations are 6, 3, 2, which are decreasing. The products in the equations are ab, cd, ac, bd, ad, bc. These are all pairwise products, but grouped in a specific way. The first equation is ab + cd, the second is ac + bd, the third is ad + bc. These are sometimes called the \"quadratics in pairs\".\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as vectors and use inner products. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the variables as two pairs: (a, b) and (c, d). Then, the equations relate these pairs. Maybe set x = a + c and y = b + d, but we already know x + y = 6. Alternatively, set m = a + b and n = c + d, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe consider the following: Let me add equations 1, 2, 3:\n\nab + cd + ac + bd + ad + bc = 11\n\nBut as we saw earlier, this is equal to (a + b + c + d)^2 - (a² + b² + c² + d²) all over 2. So:\n\n(36 - (a² + b² + c² + d²)) / 2 = 11 ⇒ a² + b² + c² + d² = 14\n\nSo sum of squares is 14. Maybe we can use this with the sum of variables. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the variables in terms of variables x = a + c and y = b + d. Then x + y = 6. Then, maybe express the equations in terms of x and y.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, let me think of variables as two variables: p = a + c and q = b + d. Then p + q = 6.\n\nBut then, how to express the products ab, cd, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, use variables like S1 = a + c, S2 = b + d, S3 = a + d, S4 = b + c. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as roots of a quadratic. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a and c are roots of x² - px + q = 0, and b and d are roots of x² - rx + s = 0. Then:\n\nFor a and c: a + c = p, a c = q\n\nFor b and d: b + d = r, b d = s\n\nThen, the equations:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n\n2. ac + bd = 3\n\n3. ad + bc = 2\n\nExpressed in terms of p, r, q, s:\n\n1. ab + cd = a b + c d = ?\n\nBut since a + c = p and b + d = r, but a and c are roots of x² - px + q, so a c = q, similarly b d = s.\n\nBut ab is not directly related. Hmm, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use symmetric sums. Let me recall that in symmetric equations, sometimes introducing symmetric sums like σ1 = a + b + c + d, σ2 = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd, σ3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd, σ4 = abcd. But given that we have four variables, but the equations given are not symmetric, but they are combinations of products.\n\nWait, σ1 is given as 6. σ2 is the sum of all pairwise products, which we can compute from the sum of squares:\n\nσ2 = (σ1)^2 - sum of squares)/2 = (36 - 14)/2 = 22/2 = 11. So σ2 = 11, which matches the sum we had earlier. So σ2 = 11.\n\nBut our equations 1,2,3 are not σ2. Let me see:\n\nEquation 1: ab + cd = 6\n\nEquation 2: ac + bd = 3\n\nEquation 3: ad + bc = 2\n\nSo these are different combinations. Let me think of variables as two pairs: (a, c) and (b, d). Then, equations 1,2,3 involve products within each pair and between pairs.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as two variables multiplied by two others. For example, if we set x = a + c and y = b + d, then x + y = 6. Let's see if we can express equations 1,2,3 in terms of x and y.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use the following approach: Let me denote p = a + b and q = c + d. Then p + q = 6. Let me also denote r = a + c and s = b + d. Then r + s = 6 as well. But maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps consider variables u = a + c and v = b + d, as before.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as two variables each. For example, let me set u = a + c and v = b + d, so u + v = 6. Then, perhaps express equations 1,2,3 in terms of u, v, and other symmetric sums.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, let me try to consider variables a and b, c and d. Let me denote m = a + b and n = c + d. Then m + n = 6.\n\nThen, the equations 1,2,3 can be written in terms of m, n, and other products. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1: ab + cd = 6\n\nBut ab is part of m = a + b, and cd is part of n = c + d. Similarly, but not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that ab = (a + b)^2 - (a² + b²) / 2, but this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables a, b, c, d as two variables each, such that:\n\nLet me consider variables (a, c) and (b, d). Then, equations 1,2,3 involve products of these pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set x = a + c and y = b + d, as before. Then x + y = 6. Let me also set z = a - c and w = b - d. Then, perhaps express equations in terms of x, y, z, w. But this might be too many variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use the following idea: Since we have equations involving ab, cd, etc., maybe I can consider variables a, b, c, d as roots of a quartic equation, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a system of equations where variables are linked through their products. Maybe use substitution step by step.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others. Let's see. From equation 4: d = 6 - a - b - c. Substitute into equations 1,2,3.\n\nEquation 1: ab + c(6 - a - b - c) = 6\n\nEquation 2: a c + b(6 - a - b - c) = 3\n\nEquation 3: a(6 - a - b - c) + bc = 2\n\nLet me expand these:\n\nEquation 1:\n\nab + 6c - a c - b c - c² = 6\n\nEquation 2:\n\na c + 6b - a b - b² - b c = 3\n\nEquation 3:\n\n6a - a² - a b - a c + b c = 2\n\nNow, this gives three equations with variables a, b, c.

Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. \\( a^3 + b^2c = a c \\)\n2. \\( b^3 + c^2a = b a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 + a^2b = c b \\)\n\nHmm. All three equations are kind of similar in structure. Each variable is cubed and multiplied by another variable, then added to a product of two variables squared and the third. Each result is equal to the product of the first variable and the third one. \n\nFirst thought: Maybe some symmetry here. If a, b, c are all equal, that could work. Let me check that. Suppose a = b = c = k. Then substituting into the first equation:\n\n\\( k^3 + k^2 * k = k * k \\)\nSimplify: \\( k^3 + k^3 = k^2 \\)\nWhich is \\( 2k^3 = k^2 \\)\nIf k ≠ 0, divide both sides by k²: 2k = 1 ⇒ k = 1/2\nIf k = 0, then 0 + 0 = 0, which is okay. So possible solutions (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and (0,0,0). Let me check the second equation with a = b = c = 1/2:\n\nLeft side: (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4\nRight side: (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. Okay, works.\nSimilarly for the third equation: same result. So (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is a solution. And (0,0,0) obviously works since all terms become zero.\n\nBut maybe there are other solutions where a, b, c aren't all equal. Let's consider cases where one of them is zero. Suppose a = 0. Then let's substitute into the equations:\n\nFirst equation: 0 + b²c = 0 * c ⇒ b²c = 0. So either b = 0 or c = 0.\n\nIf a = 0 and b = 0, then third equation: c³ + 0 = c * 0 ⇒ c³ = 0 ⇒ c = 0. So (0,0,0) again.\n\nIf a = 0 and c = 0, then second equation: b³ + 0 = b * 0 ⇒ b³ = 0 ⇒ b = 0. Again, trivial solution.\n\nSo, if a = 0, only solution is (0,0,0). Similarly, if b = 0 or c = 0, maybe similar things happen. Let me check.\n\nCase 1: a = 0. As above, only solution is (0,0,0).\n\nCase 2: b = 0. Let's substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst equation: a³ + 0 = a c ⇒ a³ = a c.\n\nSecond equation: 0 + c²a = 0 * a ⇒ c²a = 0. So either c = 0 or a = 0.\n\nIf a = 0, then from first equation: 0 = 0 * c ⇒ 0 = 0, but then third equation: c³ + 0 = c * 0 ⇒ c³ = 0 ⇒ c = 0. So (0,0,0).\n\nIf c = 0, then first equation: a³ = a * 0 ⇒ a³ = 0 ⇒ a = 0. Then third equation: 0 + 0 = 0 ⇒ 0 = 0. So again, only (0,0,0).\n\nCase 3: c = 0. Substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst equation: a³ + b²*0 = a*0 ⇒ a³ = 0 ⇒ a = 0.\n\nSecond equation: b³ + 0 = b*0 ⇒ b³ = 0 ⇒ b = 0.\n\nThird equation: 0 + a²b = 0 ⇒ 0 = 0. So again, only (0,0,0).\n\nSo, if any of a, b, c is zero, the only solution is all zeros. So non-trivial solutions must have all variables non-zero. Let's assume a, b, c ≠ 0. Then we can divide by a, b, c as needed.\n\nLooking at the original equations:\n\n1. \\( a^3 + b^2c = a c \\)\n2. \\( b^3 + c^2a = b a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 + a^2b = c b \\)\n\nLet me rearrange each equation:\n\n1. \\( a^3 = a c - b^2 c \\)\n2. \\( b^3 = b a - c^2 a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 = c b - a^2 b \\)\n\nFactor out the common terms:\n\n1. \\( a^3 = c(a - b^2) \\)\n2. \\( b^3 = a(b - c^2) \\)\n3. \\( c^3 = b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nHmm. Interesting. So each variable cubed is equal to another variable times (another variable minus the square of the third). Not sure yet. Let me see if I can find ratios or relations between a, b, c.\n\nLet me denote x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a. But maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, maybe take the ratios of the equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that a, b, c are all equal, which we already found (0 and 1/2). But maybe there are other solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider dividing each equation by a, b, c respectively (since they are non-zero):\n\n1. \\( a^2 = c - b^2 \\frac{c}{a} \\)\n2. \\( b^2 = a - c^2 \\frac{a}{b} \\)\n3. \\( c^2 = b - a^2 \\frac{b}{c} \\)\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at equation 1: \\( a^3 = c(a - b^2) \\). Similarly for others. Let me express c from equation 1:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( c = \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: \\( a = \\frac{b^3}{b - c^2} \\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( b = \\frac{c^3}{c - a^2} \\)\n\nSo, substituting c from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n\\( a = \\frac{b^3}{b - \\left( \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\right)^2 } \\)\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider multiplying all three equations together. Let me see:\n\nLeft sides multiplied: (a^3 + b^2c)(b^3 + c^2a)(c^3 + a^2b)\n\nRight sides multiplied: (ac)(ba)(cb) = a^2 b^2 c^2\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe not the best path.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equations can be rewritten as:\n\n1. \\( a^3 - a c = -b^2 c \\)\n2. \\( b^3 - b a = -c^2 a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 - c b = -a^2 b \\)\n\nFactor the left-hand sides:\n\n1. \\( a(a^2 - c) = -b^2 c \\)\n2. \\( b(b^2 - a) = -c^2 a \\)\n3. \\( c(c^2 - b) = -a^2 b \\)\n\nHmm. Let me write these as:\n\n1. \\( a(a^2 - c) = -b^2 c \\)\n2. \\( b(b^2 - a) = -c^2 a \\)\n3. \\( c(c^2 - b) = -a^2 b \\)\n\nNot sure. Maybe if I add all three equations:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 - (a c + b a + c b) = -b^2 c - c^2 a - a^2 b\n\nSo, left side: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - ac - ba - cb\n\nRight side: - (a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2)\n\nHmm. Let me recall that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract the equations. Let's see:\n\nFrom equation 1: a^3 - a c = -b^2 c\n\nFrom equation 2: b^3 - b a = -c^2 a\n\nFrom equation 3: c^3 - c b = -a^2 b\n\nLet me rearrange each equation:\n\n1. \\( a^3 - a c + b^2 c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( b^3 - b a + c^2 a = 0 \\)\n3. \\( c^3 - c b + a^2 b = 0 \\)\n\nAlternatively, factor terms:\n\n1. \\( a(a^2 - c) + b^2 c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( b(b^2 - a) + c^2 a = 0 \\)\n3. \\( c(c^2 - b) + a^2 b = 0 \\)\n\nStill not obvious. Maybe if I suppose that a = b = c, which we already did, but let's see if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are all equal to k. Then as before, we have 2k^3 = k^2 ⇒ k = 0 or 1/2. So those solutions are confirmed.\n\nBut maybe there are solutions where a, b, c are negatives of each other? Let's try a = -b, b = -c, etc. But this might get complicated. Let me test a simple case.\n\nSuppose a = -b. Then substitute into the equations:\n\nFirst equation: (-b)^3 + b^2 c = (-b) c\n\nSimplify: -b^3 + b^2 c = -b c\n\nBring all terms to left: -b^3 + b^2 c + b c = 0\n\nFactor out b: b(-b^2 + b c + c) = 0\n\nSince b ≠ 0, then -b^2 + b c + c = 0 ⇒ -b^2 + c(b + 1) = 0 ⇒ c = b^2 / (b + 1)\n\nSecond equation: b^3 + c^2 (-b) = b (-b)\n\nSimplify: b^3 - b c^2 = -b^2\n\nBring all terms to left: b^3 - b c^2 + b^2 = 0\n\nFactor out b: b(b^2 - c^2 + b) = 0\n\nSince b ≠ 0, then b^2 - c^2 + b = 0 ⇒ b^2 + b - c^2 = 0\n\nBut c = b^2 / (b + 1), so substitute:\n\nb^2 + b - (b^2 / (b + 1))^2 = 0\n\nThis seems messy. Let me compute c^2:\n\nc^2 = (b^4)/(b + 1)^2\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nb^2 + b - (b^4)/(b + 1)^2 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + 1)^2:\n\n(b^2 + b)(b + 1)^2 - b^4 = 0\n\nExpand (b^2 + b)(b + 1)^2:\n\nFirst, (b + 1)^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1\n\nThen (b^2 + b)(b^2 + 2b + 1) = b^2(b^2 + 2b + 1) + b(b^2 + 2b + 1)\n\n= b^4 + 2b^3 + b^2 + b^3 + 2b^2 + b\n\n= b^4 + 3b^3 + 3b^2 + b\n\nSubtract b^4: 3b^3 + 3b^2 + b = 0\n\nFactor out b: b(3b^2 + 3b + 1) = 0\n\nSince b ≠ 0, then 3b^2 + 3b + 1 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: 9 - 12 = -3 < 0. So no real solutions. Therefore, assuming a = -b leads to no real solutions except trivial.\n\nSo maybe trying specific relations isn't helping. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\n1. \\( a^3 + b^2c = a c \\)\n2. \\( b^3 + c^2a = b a \\)\n3. \\( c^3 + a^2b = c b \\)\n\nLet me try to express each equation in terms of ratios. For example, from equation 1:\n\n\\( a^3 = a c - b^2 c \\)\n\nDivide both sides by a (since a ≠ 0):\n\n\\( a^2 = c - b^2 \\frac{c}{a} \\)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\n\\( b^2 = a - c^2 \\frac{a}{b} \\)\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n\\( c^2 = b - a^2 \\frac{b}{c} \\)\n\nThis seems recursive. Let me denote \\( \\frac{c}{a} = k \\), so c = k a. Similarly, from equation 1, \\( a^2 = c - b^2 \\frac{c}{a} \\). Substitute c = k a:\n\n\\( a^2 = k a - b^2 k \\)\n\nDivide both sides by a (since a ≠ 0):\n\n\\( a = k - b^2 \\frac{k}{a} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\n\\( a^2 = k a - b^2 k \\)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Not helpful. Maybe need another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the ratios between variables. Let me set x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a. Then xyz = 1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that equations are cyclic. Let's suppose that a = b = c. Wait, already did that. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation. Wait, but they are non-linear. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation ", "answer": "\\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), \\ (a, b, c) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right).\\)  \n\nJeśli \\(a = 0\\), to z drugiego równania otrzymujemy \\(b = 0\\).  \nPodobnie, jeśli \\(b = 0\\), to z trzeciego równania dostajemy \\(c = 0\\), a jeśli  \n\\(c = 0\\), to pierwsze równanie daje \\(a = 0\\).

So, we have a grid of points with coordinates from 1 to 106 in both x and y. Some points are marked, and for any two marked points (x, y) and (x', y'), at least one of these two conditions must hold: either x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10, or x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10. We need to find the maximum number of marked points possible under these conditions.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. So, if I pick two points, they can't be too far apart. The conditions are saying that for any two points, one has to be within 10 units (in both x and y) of the other, but not necessarily in the same direction. So, for example, if one point is to the left and the other is below, but both at least 10 units away in each coordinate, that's not allowed. Wait, no. Let me parse the conditions again.\n\nCondition (1): x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10. So, rearranged, that means x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10. Similarly, condition (2): x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10, which rearranged is x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, if we have (x, y) and (x', y'), then condition (1) is x > x' - 10 AND y > y' - 10. So that's equivalent to x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10. Similarly, condition (2) is x' > x - 10 AND y' > y - 10, which is equivalent to x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10, which can be written as x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10? Wait, no. Let me take it step by step.\n\nCondition (1): x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10. So, x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10. So, this is saying that the other point is within a 10-unit rectangle to the right and above the first point. Similarly, condition (2): x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10, which is x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10. Wait, that's the same as condition (1)? That can't be. Wait, no. Wait, x' > x - 10 is equivalent to x > x' - 10, right? Let me check with numbers. If x' is 5 and x is 10, then x' > x - 10 is 5 > 0, which is true, and x > x' - 10 is 10 > -5, which is also true. So, actually, these two are equivalent? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's take x and x'. If x' > x - 10, then x' +10 > x. Similarly, x > x' -10 implies x -10 < x'. So, x' > x -10 and x < x' +10. So, x and x' are within 10 units of each other in the x-coordinate. Similarly for y and y'. So, actually, condition (1) is that both coordinates are at least 10 less than the other point's coordinate. Wait, so if (x, y) and (x', y') are two points, then either (x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10) or (x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10). Wait, but actually, these two conditions are not the same. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have two points, (x, y) = (10, 10) and (x', y') = (20, 20). Then, check condition (1): x > x' -10 => 10 > 10, which is false. y > y' -10 => 10 > 10, false. So condition (1) fails. Condition (2): x' > x -10 => 20 > 0, which is true. y' > y -10 => 20 > 0, true. So condition (2) holds. So in this case, the two points (10,10) and (20,20) satisfy condition (2) but not condition (1). So, they are allowed as long as at least one condition holds.\n\nWait, but if two points are more than 10 apart in both coordinates, then neither condition holds. For example, (1,1) and (20,20). Then, x > x' -10 => 1 > 10, false; y > y' -10 => 1 > 10, false. So condition (1) fails. Condition (2): x' > x -10 => 20 > -9, which is true; y' > y -10 => 20 > -9, true. So condition (2) holds. So even though they are 19 units apart in each coordinate, the second condition still holds. Wait, so in this case, the two points are 19 units apart in each coordinate, but the second condition is satisfied because x' > x -10 (20 > -9) and y' > y -10 (20 > -9). So, in this case, even if the points are outside the 10-unit range, the second condition can still be satisfied.\n\nSo, the key is that for any two points, either one is to the left and above the other by more than 10 units in each coordinate (but only one direction), or they are within 10 units in both coordinates. Wait, no. Wait, let me rephrase.\n\nWait, actually, the two conditions cover cases where the points are either close in both coordinates or one is significantly to the left and above the other, but not too far.\n\nWait, maybe another way to look at it: the two points cannot be such that one is more than 10 units to the left and below the other. Because if one is more than 10 to the left and below, then neither condition (1) nor (2) is satisfied. So, the forbidden pairs are those where one is more than 10 left and more than 10 below the other.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of points where no two points are such that one is more than 10 units to the left and below the other. So, to maximize the number of points, we need to arrange them such that this doesn't happen.\n\nThis seems similar to a grid where we have to avoid certain positions relative to each other. Maybe we can model this as a graph where each point is a node, and edges connect points that cannot coexist. Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum independent set in this graph.\n\nBut maybe there's a more straightforward way. Let me think about how to arrange the points.\n\nIf we can arrange the points in such a way that for any two points, if one is to the left, the other is not more than 10 units below, or vice versa. Alternatively, we can tile the grid in such a way that each block of 10x10 allows certain points, and then the next block is shifted so that the forbidden regions don't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps color the grid in some pattern where each color represents a point that can be included, and no two points of the same color are forbidden. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, another approach: suppose we partition the grid into overlapping 10x10 squares. Each 10x10 square can contain at most 100 points, but since the grid is 106x106, we can't tile it without overlapping. However, maybe the maximum number of points is 106*10, but that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to a grid where each point must have certain neighbors, and we need to avoid having two points that are too far apart.\n\nAlternatively, if we model this as a graph where each node is a point, and edges connect points that are more than 10 units apart in both coordinates, then the problem is to find the maximum independent set in this graph. However, maximum independent set is generally hard, but maybe the structure here allows for a solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to arrange the points so that in each row, they are spaced at most 10 units apart in the y-coordinate, but shifted in such a way that vertically they also don't conflict. Wait, but the condition is about both coordinates.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a poset. The relation is that two points are incomparable if they are more than 10 units apart in both coordinates. Then, the problem is to find the largest antichain in this poset. According to Dilworth's theorem, the size of the largest antichain is equal to the minimal number of chains needed to cover the poset. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a grid coloring approach. If we color the grid with colors in such a way that any two points of the same color are not more than 10 units apart in both coordinates. Then, the maximum number of points would be the number of colors multiplied by the grid size divided by the number of points per color. But I need to think more concretely.\n\nWait, let's consider the grid as a 2D array. If we can select points such that in every 10x10 subgrid, we pick a certain number of points, and then tile the entire grid with these subgrids. But since the grid is 106x106, which is 10*106 + 6 in each dimension, maybe overlapping is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if we arrange the points in a diagonal pattern, such that each point is at most 10 units to the left and above the previous one. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think of the grid as a chessboard, but with a larger block size. If we divide the grid into blocks of 11x11, then within each block, we can place points such that they are within 10 units of each other. But the problem is that the grid is 106x106, which is not a multiple of 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each point (x, y) is connected to points (x+1, y), (x+2, y), ..., (x+10, y) and (x, y+1), (x, y+2), ..., (x, y+10). But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, another idea: if we can ensure that in any vertical or horizontal slice of 10 units, there's at most one point. But the problem is in both x and y. Wait, perhaps if we arrange points in such a way that in every 10x10 square, there's at most 10 points. But 106 is 10*10 + 6, so maybe 106/10 = 10.6, so 11 blocks, but overlapping would occur.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as layers. Suppose we fix the x-coordinate and vary the y-coordinate. If two points are in the same layer (same x), then their y-coordinates must be within 10 of each other. Similarly, if they are in adjacent layers (x and x+1), then their y-coordinates can differ by at most 10. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the condition is that for any two points, either x > x' -10 and y > y' -10 or vice versa. So if two points are in adjacent layers (x and x+1), then for condition (1), x > x' -10 would be x+1 > x -10, which is 1 > -10, always true. Similarly, y > y' -10. So, if two points are in adjacent layers, then condition (1) is satisfied if y > y' -10. So, if one point is in x, y and the other is in x+1, y', then if y' < y +10, then condition (1) is satisfied. So, in order to have two points in adjacent layers, their y-coordinates must be within 10 of each other. Similarly, if two points are in the same layer, their y-coordinates must be within 10 of each other. Wait, but for two points in the same layer, x is the same, so x' = x, so x > x' -10 is x > x -10, which is always true. Similarly, y > y' -10. So, for two points in the same layer, the condition reduces to y > y' -10, which is equivalent to y' < y +10. So, if two points are in the same layer, their y-coordinates must be within 10 of each other. Similarly, for points in different layers, their x-coordinates must be within 10 of each other, and their y-coordinates must be within 10 of each other. Wait, no. Wait, if two points are in different layers (different x), then x' > x -10 and y' > y -10. So, if two points are in x and x+1, then x' > x -10 is x+1 > x -10, which is 1 > -10, always true. Similarly, y' > y -10. So, the y-coordinate of the lower point must be less than y +10. So, if two points are in adjacent layers, their y-coordinates must be within 10. Similarly, if two points are in layers x and x+2, then x' > x -10 is x+2 > x -10, which is 2 > -10, always true. So, actually, for any two points in different layers, as long as their y-coordinates are within 10, the condition is (2) is satisfied. Wait, but if two points are in the same column (same x) but 11 apart in y, then their y-coordinates are 11 apart, which would violate the condition. Similarly, two points in adjacent columns but 11 apart vertically would also violate the condition. So,", "answer": "**Niech** \\( X \\) **będzie zbiorem spełniającym warunki zadania.

The goal is to find the maximum number of such non-zero \\( a_{ij} \\) depending on \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. We have a quadratic form in variables \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\), each taking values in \\{ -1, 1 \\}. The coefficients \\( a_{ij} \\) are real numbers, and the condition is that no matter what values we assign to \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\) (each being -1 or 1), the entire quadratic form evaluates to either -1 or 1. The question is: how many non-zero \\( a_{ij} \\) can we have at most?\n\nSo, the key constraints here are:\n1. The quadratic form must take only values -1 or 1 for all possible inputs \\( x_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\} \\).\n2. We need to maximize the number of non-zero coefficients \\( a_{ij} \\).\n\nFirst, maybe I should recall some properties of quadratic forms over the hypercube \\( \\{-1, 1\\}^n \\). Quadratic forms here are functions \\( f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\sum_{i < j} a_{ij}x_i x_j \\). The condition is that this function only takes values in \\{-1, 1\\} for all inputs.\n\nI know that quadratic forms on the hypercube can be expressed in terms of Fourier analysis or through their eigenvalues. But maybe there's a simpler approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that for each input vector \\( x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\), the quadratic form \\( Q(x) = \\sum_{i < j} a_{ij}x_i x_j \\) must be either -1 or 1. So, there are \\( 2^n \\) possible inputs, but the function only takes two values. The question is how many coefficients we can have such that this holds.\n\nBut the problem is not about the function's behavior on all inputs, but rather that for any input, Q(x) must be -1 or 1. So, for each of the \\( 2^n \\) inputs, Q(x) is either -1 or 1. Therefore, the number of possible outcomes is restricted. But how does that affect the coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as a system of equations. For each input \\( x \\), the quadratic form must equal either 1 or -1. So, we have \\( 2^n \\) equations (but actually, each equation is either Q(x) = 1 or Q(x) = -1, depending on x). However, the variables here are the coefficients \\( a_{ij} \\). But since we have more equations than variables (there are \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\) coefficients), but the number of equations is \\( 2^n \\), which is exponential in n. But of course, these equations are not all independent. For example, flipping all the variables \\( x_i \\) to -x_i would change the sign of each product \\( x_i x_j \\), so the quadratic form would change sign. But the problem states that Q(x) must be either -1 or 1 for any x. So, if we flip all variables, the quadratic form would be -Q(x), so it's either -1 or 1. So that's consistent.\n\nBut maybe the key idea is that the quadratic form must be a function that is invariant under negating all variables, up to a sign. But since Q(x) must be either 1 or -1, and flipping all variables would change Q(x) to -Q(x), so if Q(x) is 1 for some x, then flipping variables would give Q(-x) = -Q(x) = -1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the quadratic form as a function on the hypercube, which is entirely determined by its Fourier coefficients. But since the quadratic form is only quadratic, its Fourier representation would have terms up to degree 2. However, since the hypercube is a product space, the Fourier basis is composed of characters \\( \\chi_S(x) = \\prod_{i \\in S} x_i \\), where S is a subset of the coordinates. For quadratic functions, we only consider subsets S of size 1 or 2. But since the quadratic form is a sum over i < j a_{ij}x_i x_j, that corresponds to the Fourier coefficients for the pairs {i, j}.\n\nBut the problem states that for any x, the value is either -1 or 1. So, the quadratic form is a function f: {-1, 1}^n -> {-1, 1}. Such functions are called Boolean functions, but they are over the hypercube. However, quadratic Boolean functions are specific.\n\nBut in general, a quadratic Boolean function can be written as the sum of linear terms and quadratic terms. However, in our case, there are no linear terms, since the sum starts at i < j, so all terms are quadratic. So, the function is a quadratic form with no linear terms.\n\nBut such a function can be written in terms of its Fourier coefficients. The Fourier expansion of f is:\n\nf(x) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq [n]} \\hat{f}(S) \\chi_S(x),\n\nwhere \\chi_S(x) = \\prod_{i \\in S} x_i.\n\nFor a quadratic function, the Fourier coefficients \\hat{f}(S) are zero for |S| ≥ 3. So, only subsets S of size 1 or 2 have non-zero coefficients.\n\nBut in our case, the quadratic form is given by the sum over i < j a_{ij}x_i x_j, which corresponds to the Fourier coefficients for the pairs {i, j}, so for each pair {i, j}, the coefficient a_{ij} is equal to \\hat{f}(\\{i, j\\}).\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding a quadratic Boolean function f: {-1, 1}^n -> {-1, 1} such that all the Fourier coefficients for pairs (degree 2) are non-zero, and we need to maximize the number of such non-zero coefficients.\n\nBut the problem is not about the Fourier coefficients, but about the original coefficients a_{ij}. So, if we can find such a function f with as many non-zero Fourier coefficients (i.e., as many pairs {i, j} with non-zero a_{ij}) as possible, then that would be the answer.\n\nBut how many non-zero Fourier coefficients can a quadratic Boolean function have? The total number of possible pairs {i, j} is \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\). But the Fourier coefficients for the pairs must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nMoreover, the function f must satisfy that for all x, f(x) ∈ {-1, 1}. So, it's a kind of balanced function? Wait, but f(x) can take two values. However, the hypercube has 2^n points, and f maps each to either -1 or 1. So, it's a function that is surjective onto {-1, 1}. But actually, it's more than that: for any x, f(x) is either -1 or 1.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of non-zero Fourier coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the function f as a product of two linear functions. Because if f is a product of two linear functions, then it's a quadratic function, and such a function can only take values 1 or -1. For example, if f(x) = (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n) * (some other linear combination), but actually, no, that product would be a quadratic form, but depending on the coefficients, it could take more values.\n\nWait, but if f is a product of two linear functions, then f(x) = (a_1 x_1 + ... + a_n x_n)(b_1 x_1 + ... + b_n x_n). Expanding this gives a quadratic form, and since each x_i is ±1, the product would be 1 or -1? Wait, not necessarily. For example, if you take (x_1)(x_2) = x_1 x_2, which is 1 if x_1 and x_2 are the same, -1 otherwise. So, products of linear functions can indeed produce quadratic functions that take values ±1. But in our problem, the quadratic form itself is the function f(x), so maybe f(x) is such a product. However, the problem allows any quadratic form, not necessarily a product of linear functions.\n\nBut if f(x) is a product of two linear functions, then it can be written as f(x) = L(x) * M(x), where L and M are linear functions. Then, since L(x) and M(x) each take values ±1, their product also takes values ±1. So, such functions would satisfy the condition. However, the number of non-zero coefficients in such a product would be the number of non-zero coefficients in L and M. For example, if L is a linear function with k non-zero coefficients, and M is another linear function with m non-zero coefficients, then the product would have km non-zero coefficients. But in our problem, the quadratic form is the sum over i < j a_{ij}x_i x_j, so the coefficients a_{ij} correspond to the products of the coefficients in L and M. So, if L = sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i and M = sum_{j=1}^n d_j x_j, then L*M = sum_{i,j} c_i d_j x_i x_j, which can be rewritten as sum_{i < j} (c_i d_j + c_j d_i) x_i x_j + sum_{i} c_i d_i x_i^2. But since x_i^2 = 1, this simplifies to sum_{i < j} (c_i d_j + c_j d_i) x_i x_j + sum_{i} c_i d_i. However, in our problem, the quadratic form is without linear terms, so the sum over i < j terms. Therefore, if we set the linear terms (the sum over i of c_i d_i) to zero, then we have f(x) = sum_{i < j} (c_i d_j + c_j d_i) x_i x_j. Therefore, the coefficients a_{ij} = c_i d_j + c_j d_i. So, in this case, the number of non-zero coefficients a_{ij} would be the number of pairs (i, j) where at least one of c_i or c_j is non-zero. Wait, no, because a_{ij} is c_i d_j + c_j d_i. So, even if c_i and c_j are both zero, a_{ij} could be non-zero if d_i and d_j are non-zero. So, actually, the non-zero coefficients a_{ij} correspond to pairs where at least one of c_i or c_j is non-zero in the linear functions L and M.\n\nBut in order for the product L*M to have no linear terms, we need sum_{i} c_i d_i = 0. So, the inner product of vectors c and d must be zero. Therefore, if we have two vectors c and d such that their inner product is zero, then the product L*M has no linear terms and is a quadratic form with coefficients a_{ij} = c_i d_j + c_j d_i.\n\nTherefore, in such a case, the number of non-zero coefficients a_{ij} is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) where at least one of c_i, c_j, d_i, d_j is non-zero. However, since a_{ij} is c_i d_j + c_j d_i, even if only one of c_i or d_i is non-zero, and the other is zero, then a_{ij} could be non-zero. Wait, no. If c_i is non-zero and d_j is non-zero, then a_{ij} = c_i d_j + c_j d_i. If c_j is zero and d_i is zero, then a_{ij} = c_i d_j. So, if only one of c_i or d_j is non-zero, then a_{ij} is non-zero. But if both c_i and d_j are non-zero, then a_{ij} is the sum of two terms. So, in any case, a_{ij} is non-zero if at least one of c_i or c_j is non-zero and at least one of d_i or d_j is non-zero. Wait, actually, for a_{ij} to be non-zero, c_i d_j + c_j d_i must be non-zero. So, even if one term is non-zero and the other is zero, the sum could be non-zero. For example, if c_i ≠ 0 and d_j = 0, but c_j = 0 and d_i = something else. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nSuppose c_i ≠ 0, c_j = 0, d_i = 0, d_j ≠ 0. Then, a_{ij} = c_i d_j + c_j d_i = c_i d_j + 0 = c_i d_j. Since c_i ≠ 0 and d_j ≠ 0, then a_{ij} ≠ 0. So, in this case, even though c_j and d_i are zero, a_{ij} is non-zero. So, the non-zero a_{ij} can occur even if only one of the four coefficients (c_i, c_j, d_i, d_j) is non-zero. But in such a case, the other coefficients could be zero. However, the problem is that if we have such a situation, then the inner product sum_{i} c_i d_i must be zero. So, the vectors c and d must be orthogonal.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this. Let me consider specific small cases to get some intuition.\n\nLet’s start with n=2. Then, we have only one coefficient a_{12}. The quadratic form is a_{12}x_1 x_2. The possible inputs are (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). For each of these, the product x_1 x_2 is 1, -1, -1, 1. So, the quadratic form is a_{12} * [1, -1, -1, 1]. But according to the problem, the quadratic form must be in {-1, 1} for all inputs. Therefore, a_{12} * [1, -1, -1, 1] must be either", "answer": "**Wykażemy, że możliwa liczba niezerowych liczb 𝑎𝑖𝑗 to 1 dla 𝑛 = 2, 3 oraz 1 i 4 dla 𝑛 ≥ 4.**  \nDla 𝑥 = (𝑥₁, ..., 𝑥ₙ), niech 𝑓(𝑥) = ∑ ₁≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗.

The function f is injective, so it's a permutation of the grid points. But we need to ensure that whenever v and w are distinct, the vector v - w plus f(v) - f(w) is not a multiple of (m, n). \n\nAlternatively, rearranging, f(v) - f(w) is not equal to (a m, b n) - (v - w). So for distinct v and w, f(v) - f(w) can't be a translate of (a m, b n) minus (v - w). Hmm, maybe this is related to some kind of difference set or Latin squares? Not sure yet.\n\nLet me consider the case when m and n are coprime. Maybe that's a starting point. Suppose m and n are coprime. Then, perhaps we can define a function f such that f(v) shifts the coordinates in a way that avoids these differences. Alternatively, maybe f acts as a derangement in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid A_{m,n} as the additive group modulo (m, n). Wait, but the grid is a set of points, not a group. However, if we consider the coordinates modulo m and n, maybe there's a connection to group theory. But the function f has to be a permutation, so it's a bijection on the grid.\n\nCondition (2) can be rephrased as: For any distinct v, w, the difference f(v) - f(w) is not congruent to a m in the first coordinate and b n in the second coordinate modulo m and n. Wait, actually, the equation v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (a m, b n) implies that (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) = (a m, b n). So, the sum of the difference vectors in the original grid and the function grid equals a multiple of (m, n). Therefore, to avoid this, for distinct v and w, (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) should not be a multiple of (m, n). \n\nBut since v and w are in A_{m,n}, their coordinates are between 0 and m-1, n-1. So, the difference vectors v - w have coordinates between -(m-1) and m-1, and similarly for f(v) - f(w). Therefore, the sum (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) has coordinates between -(2m - 2) and 2m - 2 in the first component and -(2n - 2) and 2n - 2 in the second component. But since we are dealing with multiples of (m, n), which are (a m, b n), these multiples can be any integer linear combinations. However, since the grid is finite, we need to ensure that the equation only holds when v = w.\n\nMaybe considering the function f as a bijection and analyzing the differences. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake m = 1, n = 1. Then A_{1,1} has only one element, so trivially any function is good. But the problem says positive integers, so m and n at least 1. Wait, but m and n can be 1. Let me check if m = 1 and n = 1 is allowed. Since there's only one element, the function is trivially injective, and condition (2) is vacuously true. So (1,1) is a valid pair.\n\nWhat about m = 2, n = 2. Let's see. A_{2,2} has four elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). We need a permutation f such that if v ≠ w, then v + f(v) - w - f(w) ≠ (2a, 2b) for integers a, b. Let's try to define f as the identity function. Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (v - w). So for distinct v, w, we need that v - w ≠ (2a, 2b). But in A_{2,2}, the differences can be (±1, 0), (0, ±1), (±1, ±1). None of these are multiples of (2,2) except (0,0), which would require v = w. So if f is the identity function, then condition (2) is satisfied. Therefore, for m = n = 2, such a function exists. Wait, but in this case, the differences v - w can never be (2a, 2b) unless a = b = 0, which would require v = w. So yes, f being the identity function works here. So (2,2) is valid.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check more carefully. Suppose f is the identity function. Then for any distinct v and w, v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (v - w). Since v ≠ w, (v - w) is non-zero. But (2a, 2b) would require that each component is even. However, in A_{2,2}, the differences are (±1, 0), (0, ±1), (±1, ±1). None of these differences have both components even except (0,0). Therefore, condition (2) is satisfied. So yes, (2,2) is okay.\n\nWait, but if m and n are both 2, that works. Then what about m=1, n=2? Let's see. A_{1,2} has two elements: (0,0) and (0,1). The function f must be a permutation, so it can be either [(0,0)→(0,0), (0,1)→(0,1)] or [(0,0)→(0,1), (0,1)→(0,0)]. Let's check condition (2). Take v = (0,0) and w = (0,1). Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + f(v) - (0,1) - f(w). If f is identity, then this is (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,1) = (0 - 0, 0 - 1 - 1) = (0, -2). Which is (0, -2) = (1*0, 2*(-1)), so a=0, b=-1. So this is a multiple of (1,2). But since a and b can be any integers, even negative, this would violate condition (2). Therefore, the identity function is bad here. What if we swap them? Let f((0,0)) = (0,1) and f((0,1)) = (0,0). Then v = (0,0), w = (0,1). Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,1) - (0,1) - (0,0) = (0,1 -1 -0) = (0,0). Which is (0,0) = (1*0, 2*0). So again, this is a multiple of (1,2). Therefore, condition (2) is violated. So in this case, there is no good function for m=1, n=2. Hence, (1,2) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, m=2, n=1 would also be invalid. So m and n both need to be at least 2? Wait, but m=1, n=1 is allowed. Wait, m=1, n=1 is allowed as we saw. So (1,1) is okay. Then, perhaps the pairs where m and n are both greater than or equal to 2? But wait, when I tried m=2, n=2, the identity function worked, but when I tried m=1, n=2, it didn't. So maybe m and n need to be co-prime? Let's check m=2, n=3. Let's see if a good function exists here.\n\nA_{2,3} has 6 elements. Let's try to define a function f. Maybe a cyclic shift. For example, f((k,l)) = (k+1 mod 2, l+1 mod 3). Let's see if this works. Take two distinct points v and w. Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)). Since f is a shift by (1,1), f(v) - f(w) = (1,1) for any v, w. So the total difference is (v - w) + (1,1). We need this to not be a multiple of (2,3). Let's check possible differences v - w. Since v and w are in A_{2,3}, their differences can be (0,0), (±1,0), (0,±1), (±1,±1). Adding (1,1) to these:\n\n- (0,0) + (1,1) = (1,1) which is not a multiple of (2,3)\n- (1,0) + (1,1) = (2,1) which is (0,1) mod (2,3), not a multiple\n- (0,1) + (1,1) = (1,2) similarly not a multiple\n- (-1,0) + (1,1) = (0,1)\n- (0,-1) + (1,1) = (1,0)\n- (1,-1) + (1,1) = (2,0) which is (0,0) mod (2,3) if we add 2*1 in the first component? Wait, (2,0) is not a multiple of (2,3) unless a=0 and b=0. Wait, (2,0) is (2*1, 0) which is a multiple of (2,3) with a=1, b=0. So (2,0) is a multiple of (2,3). Therefore, if v - w = (1,-1), then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2,0), which is a multiple of (2,3). Therefore, this would violate condition (2). For example, take v and w such that v - w = (1,-1). Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2,0). So a=1, b=0. Therefore, this violates condition (2). Therefore, the shift function is bad.\n\nTherefore, perhaps shifting by a constant vector is not a good function here. Maybe another function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a derangement where each element is mapped to another position such that the differences don't align. For example, in a 2x3 grid, maybe swap rows or columns. Let's try swapping rows. Let f((k,l)) = (1 - k mod 2, l mod 3). So for k=0: f((0,l)) = (1, l), for k=1: f((1,l)) = (0, l). Let's check condition (2). Take v = (0,0) and w = (1,0). Then v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (1,0) - (1,0) - (0,0) = (0,0). So this is (0,0) = (2*0, 3*0). So condition (2) is violated because v ≠ w. Therefore, this function is not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more complex permutation. For example, mapping (0,0)→(0,1), (0,1)→(1,0), (1,0)→(0,0), (1,1)→(1,1). But in a 2x3 grid, there are 6 elements. Wait, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m and n need to be such that the grid is a group where the function f can be an automorphism or something. But A_{m,n} is just a set of points, not a group unless we define operations on them. But the function f is a permutation, so maybe related to Latin squares or orthogonal Latin squares.\n\nWait, another thought: condition (2) resembles the condition for a function to be a \"orthomorphism\" or a \"complete mapping\" in group theory. An orthomorphism is a permutation θ such that the mapping x → θ(x) - x is also a permutation. But here, the condition is different, but perhaps similar ideas apply.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of the grid as a torus, with coordinates modulo m and n, then the function f being a bijection would correspond to a permutation of the torus. Then, the condition (2) is that the sum of the displacement vectors (v - w) and (f(v) - f(w)) is not a multiple of (m, n). \n\nBut maybe another angle: if we define a function f such that f(v) = v + c mod (m,n) for some constant c, but in our case, A_{m,n} is a set of points, not a group, so addition is not defined. Wait, but actually, the coordinates are integers, and the differences are in integers. So perhaps the function f can be defined as adding a vector (c1, c2) to each v, modulo m and n. However, since the grid is finite, adding a vector would wrap around. But since we are dealing with the grid as a set of points, not as a group, the addition is not naturally defined. Wait, but the problem statement says A_{m,n} is the set of vectors (k,l) with 0 ≤ k ≤ m-1, 0 ≤ l ≤ n-1. So these are just integer coordinates in a rectangle. The function f maps these vectors to other vectors in the", "answer": "Parę \\( (n, m) \\) nazwiemy dobrą, jeśli istnieje dobra funkcja \\( f : A_{n,m} \\to A_{n,m} \\).

", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the largest positive integer n such that there exist n axis-aligned rectangles A₁, ..., Aₙ and B₁, ..., Bₙ with the properties that each A_i and B_i are disjoint, but every A_i and B_j (where i ≠ j) share at least one point. Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's visualize what's happening. Each pair of rectangles A_i and B_i doesn't overlap at all, but every other pair from different A and B share a point. So, for example, if n=1, it's trivial because you just have one A and one B that don't overlap. But for higher n, the arrangement must be such that every A and B from different pairs intersect.\n\nI remember something about grids or interval intersections in 2D. Maybe this relates to the concept of piercing sets or something like that. Wait, in 2D, the problem of covering intersections might be related to the Helly's theorem, but Helly's theorem requires that every two sets intersect, which isn't the case here. Because here, only the pairs where i ≠ j need to intersect, and the pairs where i=j are disjoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as a bipartite graph where one set is the A rectangles and the other set is the B rectangles, and edges represent intersections. Then, we need a bipartite graph where each A_i is connected to every B_j except itself. So, the graph is K_{n,n} minus the n edges connecting A_i to B_i. But the question is, can such a graph be represented geometrically with axis-aligned rectangles?\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just about the graph structure but also about the geometric realizability. So, the question is whether such an arrangement of rectangles is possible. Maybe there's a known result about this?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each rectangle A_i as being in one \"direction\" and B_i in another. For example, A_i could be horizontal rectangles and B_i vertical, but arranged such that each A_i doesn't overlap its own B_i but overlaps all others. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of each A_i and B_i as intervals on the x and y axes respectively. Wait, but rectangles are 2D, so maybe the problem can be reduced to 1D by considering projections? Let me think.\n\nSuppose we project all rectangles A_i and B_i onto the x-axis. Then, for each A_i, its projection would be an interval [a_i, b_i], and similarly for B_i. The condition that A_i and B_j intersect (for i ≠ j) would mean that their projections on x-axis overlap or on y-axis overlap? Wait, no. If two rectangles A_i and B_j intersect, then their projections on both x and y axes must overlap. Because for two rectangles to intersect, their x intervals must overlap and their y intervals must overlap.\n\nBut in our case, each A_i and B_i are disjoint. So, either their x intervals don't overlap or their y intervals don't overlap. But for other pairs A_i and B_j (i ≠ j), both x and y intervals must overlap. Hmm, this seems restrictive.\n\nSo, if we model each rectangle as a pair of intervals (x and y), then the problem reduces to arranging n pairs of intervals (A_i = (x_i, y_i)) and (B_i = (u_i, v_i)) such that:\n\n1. For all i, [x_i, y_i] and [u_i, v_i] do not overlap in both x and y (i.e., either x_i >= v_i or y_i <= u_i, or vice versa).\n2. For all i ≠ j, [x_i, y_i] overlaps with [u_j, v_j] in x, and [x_j, y_j] overlaps with [u_i, v_i] in y.\n\nWait, actually, the intersection of A_i and B_j is non-empty if and only if [x_i, y_i] overlaps with [u_j, v_j] in x and [x_j, y_j] overlaps with [u_i, v_i] in y. So, each pair (A_i, B_j) must have overlapping x intervals and overlapping y intervals.\n\nBut how can we arrange such intervals? Let's think in 1D first. Suppose we have two sets of intervals S and T. For each s in S and t in T, s and t must overlap. But S and T must also be such that for each s in S, there is a t in T where s and t do not overlap. Wait, no, in our problem, each A_i and B_i are disjoint, but all other A_i and B_j are not. So, in terms of intervals, for each i, [x_i, y_i] and [u_i, v_i] must not overlap in both x and y. But for any i ≠ j, [x_i, y_i] overlaps with [u_j, v_j] in x and overlaps with [x_j, y_j] overlaps with [u_i, v_i] in y.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's try small n first.\n\nFor n=1: Trivial, one A and one B that don't overlap.\n\nFor n=2: We need two A's and two B's. Let's try to construct this.\n\nLet’s denote A1, A2 and B1, B2. Each A_i and B_i must not overlap in both x and y. Also, A1 must overlap with B2 in x and with B1 in y. Similarly, A2 must overlap with B1 in x and with B2 in y. Similarly for B1 and B2.\n\nHow can we arrange this? Let's try to set coordinates.\n\nLet’s set the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nSuppose A1 is [0,1] x [0,1]. Then B1 must not overlap with A1, so B1 could be [2,3] x [2,3]. But then, A2 needs to overlap with B1 in x and with B2 in y. Wait, maybe this is getting messy. Let's use specific coordinates.\n\nLet me try:\n\nLet’s set A1 as [0,1] x [0,1]. Then B1 must not overlap with A1, so B1 could be [2,3] x [2,3].\n\nNow, A2 must overlap with B1 in x and with B2 in y. Let's choose B2 such that it overlaps with A2 in y. Let's say A2 is [0,1] x [1,2]. Then B2 must overlap with A2 in y, so B2's y-interval must overlap with [1,2]. But B2 also needs to not overlap with A2 in x. Wait, no, A2 and B2 must not overlap in both x and y. Wait, no: A2 and B2 must be disjoint. So, either their x intervals don't overlap or their y intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, the problem states that A_i and B_i are disjoint for all i. So, for A2 and B2, their x intervals must not overlap or their y intervals must not overlap. But in our case, we need A2 and B2 to not overlap. So, for example, if A2 is [0,1] x [1,2], then B2 could be [1,2] x [0,1], which would overlap in x and y, which is not allowed. Alternatively, B2 could be [3,4] x [0,1], which doesn't overlap with A2 in x but does in y. Wait, but B2 is supposed to be such that A2 and B2 don't overlap. So, if A2 is [0,1]x[1,2], then B2 must have either x <=0 or x >=1, and y <=1 or y >=2. If we set B2 as [3,4]x[0,1], then it doesn't overlap with A2 in x (since x in B2 is 3-4 vs A2's 0-1) and overlaps in y (y=0-1 overlaps with A2's y=1-2? Wait, no, 0-1 and 1-2 don't overlap. So, actually, A2 is [0,1]x[1,2], B2 is [3,4]x[0,1]. Then in y-direction, A2's y is [1,2], B2's y is [0,1], which don't overlap. So, actually, A2 and B2 don't overlap at all. So that works.\n\nBut now, A2 must overlap with B1 in x. B1 is [2,3]x[2,3]. So, overlapping in x would require that A2's x-interval [0,1] overlaps with B1's x-interval [2,3], which it doesn't. So that's a problem. Therefore, A2 cannot overlap with B1 in x. Wait, so my initial thought is wrong. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the requirement is that A_i and B_j must overlap for all i ≠ j. So, A1 and B2 must overlap. A2 and B1 must overlap. A1 and B1 must not overlap. So, in our example:\n\nA1: [0,1]x[0,1]\n\nB1: [2,3]x[2,3]\n\nA2: [0,1]x[1,2]\n\nB2: [3,4]x[0,1]\n\nNow, check overlaps:\n\nA1 and B2: A1's x is [0,1], B2's x is [3,4]. They don't overlap. But they need to overlap. So that's a problem. So this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nHmm. So maybe this approach isn't working. Let's try again.\n\nLet me consider vertical and horizontal rectangles. Suppose A_i are horizontal rectangles and B_i are vertical.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nA1: horizontal, say [0,2] x [0,1]\n\nB1: vertical, needs to not overlap with A1. So, B1 could be [2,3] x [0,1], but then A1 and B1 overlap in y. So that's bad. Alternatively, B1 could be [0,1] x [2,3], which doesn't overlap with A1 in x. So, A1 is [0,2]x[0,1], B1 is [0,1]x[2,3]. Then, A1 and B1 are disjoint.\n\nNow, A2 needs to overlap with B1 in x and with B2 in y. Let's set A2 as [0,1]x[1,2]. Then B2 must overlap with A2 in y. B2 also needs to not overlap with A2. If B2 is [1,2]x[0,1], then it overlaps with A2 in x and y, which is not allowed. If B2 is [3,4]x[0,1], then it doesn't overlap with A2 in x but does in y. So, B2 is [3,4]x[0,1]. Then, A2 and B2: x intervals [0,1] and [3,4] don't overlap, y intervals [1,2] and [0,1] don't overlap. So they are disjoint. That works.\n\nBut A2 needs to overlap with B1 in x. B1 is [0,1]x[2,3]. A2 is [0,1]x[1,2]. The x intervals of A2 and B1 are both [0,1], so they overlap. The y intervals are [1,2] and [2,3], which don't overlap. Wait, but the overlap in x is sufficient? Wait, no, rectangles overlap if both x and y intervals overlap. Wait, no! Wait, actually, rectangles overlap if their x intervals overlap AND their y intervals overlap. So, even if they overlap in x or y separately, they might not actually overlap. Wait, no. If two rectangles have x intervals overlapping and y intervals overlapping, then they must overlap in the plane. Because the intersection is the Cartesian product of the overlaps. So, for example, if two rectangles have x intervals [0,2] and [1,3], overlapping in [1,2], and y intervals [0,1] and [0.5,1.5], overlapping in [0.5,1], then their intersection is [1,2] x [0.5,1], which is non-empty. Therefore, in order for two rectangles to overlap, both x and y intervals must overlap.\n\nTherefore, in the previous attempt, A2 and B1 have x intervals [0,1] and [0,1], which overlap, but y intervals [1,2] and [2,3], which do not overlap. Therefore, they do not overlap. So that's a problem. So my previous arrangement was wrong.\n\nTherefore, in order for A2 and B1 to overlap, both their x and y intervals must overlap. So, A2 must be set such that its x interval overlaps with B1's x interval, and its y interval overlaps with B1's y interval.\n\nBut B1 is [0,1]x[2,3]. So, A2 must have x interval overlapping with [0,1] and y interval overlapping with [2,3]. But A2 also needs to be disjoint from B1. Wait, but if A2's x overlaps with [0,1] and y overlaps with [2,3], then A2 would have to be in [0,1]x[2,3], but then it would overlap with B1. Which is not allowed. Therefore, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, so if B1 is [0,1]x[2,3], then A2 cannot be in [0,1]x[2,3], because that would make A2 and B1 overlap. So, how can A2 have x interval overlapping with B1's x interval [0,1] and y interval overlapping with B1's y interval [2,3], but also be disjoint from B1?\n\nThis seems impossible because if A2's x is overlapping with [0,1] and y is overlapping with [2,3], then A2 must be in in [0,1]x[2,3], which is exactly where B1 is. Therefore, they would overlap. Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.\n\nTherefore, n=2 might not be possible? But that contradicts my initial intuition. Wait, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe instead of having A_i and B_i as separate rectangles, perhaps there's a way to interleave them. Let me think of an example for n=2.\n\nSuppose we have A1: [0,1]x[0,1]\n\nA2: [1,2]x[1,2]\n\nThen B1 needs to be disjoint from A1. So, B1 could be [2,3]x[2,3].

The rules are that the tiles can't overlap, can't go outside the board, and every square must be covered. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of the chessboard. It's 15x15, so that's 225 squares. Each 3x3 tile covers 9 squares, and each 2x2 tile covers 4 squares. Let's denote the number of 3x3 tiles as x and the number of 2x2 tiles as y. Then, the total area covered by the tiles would be 9x + 4y = 225. We need to find the smallest possible x (number of 3x3 tiles) such that this equation holds, and also that the tiles can be arranged without overlapping and covering the entire board.\n\nSo, mathematically, we can write 9x + 4y = 225. We need to solve for integers x and y where x is minimized. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for y: 4y = 225 - 9x, so y = (225 - 9x)/4. Since y has to be a non-negative integer, (225 - 9x) must be divisible by 4 and non-negative. Let's find x such that 225 - 9x ≡ 0 mod 4.\n\n225 divided by 4 is 56 with a remainder of 1, so 225 ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, 9x ≡ 1 mod 4. Since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, this simplifies to x ≡ 1 mod 4. So x must be congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, possible values of x are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, etc. But since x has to be such that 225 - 9x is non-negative, we can find the maximum possible x. Let's compute that.\n\n225 / 9 = 25. So x can be at most 25, but since x ≡1 mod4, the maximum x is 21 (since 21 is the largest number less than 25 that is 1 mod4: 21 = 4*5 +1). Wait, 25 is 1 mod4 (25=4*6+1), but 25*9=225, which would make y=0. But 25 is allowed? Wait, but 25*9=225, so y=(225 -225)/4=0. So x=25, y=0. But the problem is asking for the minimal number of 3x3 tiles. So maybe 0? But the problem says \"najmniejszą liczbę Kamionek 3×3\", so perhaps 0 is possible? But maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, the problem states that the tiles must be arranged without overlapping and covering the entire board. So if we use only 25 3x3 tiles, does that actually work? But 15 divided by 3 is 5, so a 15x15 board can be perfectly divided into 5x5=25 3x3 tiles. So in that case, yes, you can tile the entire board with 25 3x3 tiles. But the problem is to find the minimal number of 3x3 tiles. So if 0 is possible, then 0 is the answer. But maybe the problem is in the translation? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Wyznaczyć najmniejszą liczbę Kamionek 3×3, dla której jest to возможно.\" Translating: \"Determine the smallest number of 3×3 tiles, for which it is possible.\" So if 0 is possible, then 0 is the answer. But perhaps in the original problem, there's a condition that some 2x2 tiles are used? Wait, no, the problem says \"plynki o wymiarach 2×2 i 3×3\", so you can use any combination. So 0 is allowed. But maybe the problem is in the translation, maybe \"Kamionek\" is a specific term which might imply that the tiling must use at least one of each? But the original problem says \"plynki o wymiarach 2×2 i 3×3\", which is plural, but in the problem statement in Polish, maybe it's singular? Wait, the original problem is in Polish? The user provided the problem in Polish, but the user wrote the instructions in English. Wait, the problem was presented in English here: \"Wyznaczyć najmniejszą liczbę Kamionek 3×3, dla której jest toвозможно.\" The translation is \"Determine the smallest number of 3×3 tiles, for which it is possible.\" So the problem allows using only 3x3 tiles if possible. Since tiling the board with 25 3x3 tiles is possible, then the minimal number is 0. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about tiling the entire board, but about covering it, and maybe overlapping is allowed?

The problem is about Dana, who has to write numbers from 1 to 2n-1, each time choosing either red or blue. A pair (i, j) where i ≤ j is called good if, among the numbers from i to j, there are more numbers written in blue. We need to find the maximum number of good pairs Dana can achieve, depending on n.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. So, Dana is writing numbers 1 to 2n-1, one by one, and each time she can choose the color. Then, for any pair (i, j) with i ≤ j, we check if the number of blue numbers in positions i to j is more than the number of red ones. If so, that pair is good. We need to maximize the total number of such good pairs.\n\nWait, but does \"among the numbers i, i+1, ..., j\" refer to the numbers themselves or their positions? The problem says \"niebiesko\" which translates to \"blue\" here. So, if the number is written in blue, that counts as a blue number. So, the pair (i, j) is good if in the range from i to j (inclusive), the number of blue numbers is more than the number of red numbers.\n\nSo, for example, if between positions i and j, there are more blue numbers than red ones, then that pair is good. The goal is to color each number (i.e., assign each number a color, red or blue) such that the total number of these good pairs is maximized.\n\nNow, the question is: How can Dana maximize the number of such good pairs? Let's think about the structure here.\n\nFirst, note that a good pair is determined by the count of blue and red numbers in the interval [i, j]. Since each interval is defined by its start and end, the total number of pairs is quadratic in the number of numbers. But we need to maximize the number of intervals where blue > red.\n\nTo maximize the number of good pairs, we need to arrange the colors in such a way that as many intervals as possible have more blue than red numbers. But how?\n\nPerhaps we need to consider the cumulative counts. Let's think of the numbers from 1 to 2n-1, each colored red or blue. For each position k, let’s define a cumulative variable that keeps track of the difference between the number of blue and red numbers up to position k. Let's denote C(k) = (number of blue numbers from 1 to k) - (number of red numbers from 1 to k). Then, for any interval [i, j], the difference C(j) - C(i-1) will be equal to the number of blue numbers minus red numbers in [i, j]. So, the interval [i, j] is good if C(j) - C(i-1) > 0.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing colors such that the number of pairs (i, j) with i ≤ j and C(j) > C(i-1) is maximized. This seems similar to a problem where we want to maximize the number of inversions or comparisons in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, if we model the cumulative counts as a sequence of differences, perhaps we can find a way to maximize the number of times a later difference is greater than an earlier one.\n\nThis is starting to remind me of the concept of \"increasing subsequences\" but in a different context. If we think of the cumulative differences C(0), C(1), ..., C(2n-1) (where C(0) = 0), then each pair (i, j) with i ≤ j corresponds to a pair where C(j) > C(i-1). So, the total number of good pairs is the number of such pairs where a later term in the sequence is greater than an earlier term. This is similar to the number of inversions but instead of counting inversions, we count the number of times a later term is greater than an earlier one.\n\nIn such a case, the maximum number of such pairs would be achieved when the sequence C(0), C(1), ..., C(2n-1) is strictly increasing as much as possible. However, since each step from C(k-1) to C(k) can only increase by 1 (if we color the k-th number blue) or decrease by 1 (if we color it red), the sequence can fluctuate.\n\nBut wait, actually, each color choice affects the cumulative difference. Let's formalize this:\n\nEach number from 1 to 2n-1 is colored either red or blue. Let’s denote the color of number k as c_k, which is 1 if blue, -1 if red. Then, the cumulative difference C(k) = sum_{i=1}^k c_i. Then, the number of good pairs is the number of pairs (i, j) with i ≤ j and C(j) > C(i-1). Since C(i-1) is the cumulative difference up to i-1.\n\nAlternatively, the number of good pairs is the number of pairs (i, j) such that sum_{i ≤ m ≤ j} c_m > 0. Because C(j) - C(i-1) = sum_{i ≤ m ≤ j} c_m. So, if that sum is positive, the pair is good.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: choose each c_m in {1, -1} (since blue is more, but actually, since we want the sum to be positive, blue counts as +1 and red as -1) such that the number of subarrays (i, j) with sum > 0 is maximized.\n\nWait, but subarrays here are contiguous. So, the problem is similar to a one-dimensional array where each element is +1 or -1, and we need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays with sum > 0.\n\nThis is a known problem, but I don't remember the exact solution. However, perhaps we can model it using dynamic programming or combinatorics.\n\nLet me think. Let’s denote S_k = sum_{i=1}^k c_i. Then, the number of good pairs is the number of pairs (i, j) where S_j - S_{i-1} > 0, i.e., S_j > S_{i-1}. So, the total number is the number of times a later partial sum exceeds an earlier one.\n\nThis is similar to counting the number of inversions in the sequence of partial sums, but instead of comparing elements, we compare partial sums.\n\nIn literature, such a count is known as the number of \"exceedances\" or something similar. However, I need to recall if there's a standard formula or approach for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows. Let’s consider the partial sums S_0, S_1, ..., S_{2n-1}, where S_0 = 0 and S_k = S_{k-1} + c_k. Then, each time a partial sum exceeds a previous one, we get a good pair.\n\nBut how can we maximize the number of such instances?\n\nSuppose we have partial sums S_0, S_1, ..., S_{m}, where m = 2n - 1. The number of good pairs is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) with i ≤ j and S_j > S_i. Wait, no, since S_{i-1} is the previous partial sum. So, actually, it's the number of pairs (i, j) where S_j > S_{i-1} and i ≤ j.\n\nTherefore, for each j from 1 to m, the number of i's such that i ≤ j and S_{i-1} < S_j. So, the total number is sum_{j=1 to m} (number of i's from 1 to j where S_{i-1} < S_j).\n\nAlternatively, if we think of the partial sums as a sequence, the total number of such pairs is equivalent to the number of times a later element is greater than an earlier one in the sequence. This is similar to counting the number of inversions but in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, actually, in the sequence S_0, S_1, ..., S_{m}, the number of pairs (i, j) with i < j and S_j > S_i is equal to the total number of pairs minus the number of inversions. But here, our pairs (i, j) correspond to i ≤ j and S_j > S_{i-1}, which is slightly different.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nOriginal pairs are (i, j) with i ≤ j. The partial sum S_j - S_{i-1} > 0. So, S_j > S_{i-1}. So, for each j, we need to count how many i's from 1 to j such that S_{i-1} < S_j. Note that i-1 can be 0 to j-1. So, for each j, the number of i's where i ranges from 1 to j (so i-1 ranges from 0 to j-1) and S_{i-1} < S_j. Therefore, the total number of good pairs is sum_{j=1}^{m} (number of k=0 to j-1 where S_k < S_j).\n\nSo, if we let t_j be the number of times S_j exceeds previous partial sums, then the total number of good pairs is sum_{j=1}^m t_j.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the total number of good pairs, we need to maximize sum_{j=1}^m t_j, where t_j is the number of k < j such that S_k < S_j.\n\nThis is equivalent to, for each j, counting how many previous partial sums are less than S_j, and summing that over all j.\n\nIn order to maximize this sum, we need to arrange the partial sums such that as many later partial sums as possible are greater than as many previous partial sums as possible.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached by considering the greedy algorithm. For each position j, we want S_j to be as large as possible given the previous partial sums. However, each S_j is determined by S_{j-1} plus c_j, where c_j is either +1 (blue) or -1 (red). Therefore, to maximize S_j, we would set c_j = +1 if S_{j-1} is positive, and c_j = -1 if S_{j-1} is negative. However, this might not necessarily maximize the number of inversions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to alternate colors in a way that creates as many increasing partial sums as possible. Let's think of the worst case and best case.\n\nIf all numbers are colored blue, then all partial sums S_j = j, so each S_j is greater than all previous S_k for k < j. Therefore, for each j, t_j = j - 1, since all previous partial sums are less than S_j. Therefore, the total number of good pairs would be sum_{j=1}^{2n-1} (j - 1) = sum_{k=0}^{2n-2} k = (2n - 2)(2n - 1)/2. But this is the case where all numbers are blue. However, in that case, every pair (i, j) with i ≤ j is good, except when i = j and the number is blue. Wait, no. If all numbers are blue, then in any interval [i, j], the number of blue numbers is j - i + 1. The number of red numbers is 0. So, blue numbers are always more than red numbers, since red numbers are 0. Wait, but the problem says \"niebiesko\" which is blue, so if all are blue, then every pair is good. But that can't be, because the problem states \"nieparna\" which is not blue, i.e., red. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, the problem says: \" Debtira,icom, od 1 do 2n−1, po cooperatingi, na tablicy, albo czerwone, albonieborski.\" Wait, maybe there was a mistranslation. The original problem in Polish might have said something like \"niebiesko\" which is blue, and \"nieparna\" which is red. So, a good pair is where in the interval, the number of blue numbers is more than red numbers. Therefore, if all numbers are blue, then every interval has more blue than red numbers (since red is 0). Therefore, all pairs are good. But the total number of pairs is (2n - 1)(2n)/2, which is the total number of ordered pairs with i ≤ j. However, if all numbers are blue, then indeed all pairs are good. But the answer can't be that straightforward, because the problem says \"Odette otrzymaną najmniejszą liczbę par dobbra, dla której liczba n jest liczbą naturalną.\" Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, the original problem might have been in Polish, and maybe there was a mix-up in translating.

A pair of numbers i, j (i ≤ j) is called good if among the numbers i, i+1, ..., j, there are more blue numbers than red ones. We need to determine, in terms of n, the largest possible number of good pairs that Adam can achieve.\"\n\nOkay, so the problem says Adam can choose the colors, and we need to find the maximum number of good pairs possible. If all numbers are blue, then all pairs are good, which would give the maximum number of pairs. But that seems too easy, so maybe there's a mistake in the translation or understanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem was intended to say \"nieparna\" instead of \"nieborska\". So, if \"nieparna\" is red, then a good pair is where the number of blue numbers is more than red numbers. Therefore, if all numbers are blue, all pairs are good. But if some numbers are red, then pairs that include red numbers might not be good. However, maybe the problem is more interesting if the goal is to maximize the number of good pairs, which could be achieved by coloring all numbers blue. But this seems contradictory, because why would the problem ask for something non-trivial if the maximum is trivially all pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a mistranslation.

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the question is asking if there exists a power of 2 (so 2^k where k is a positive integer) such that in its decimal representation, every digit from 0 to 9 is used exactly the same number of times. That means each digit should appear, say, n times, where n is some integer. Since the number of digits in 2^k depends on k, I need to consider how the number of digits grows as k increases.\n\nThe number of digits d in 2^k is given by the formula d = floor(k log10 2) + 1. Since log10 2 is approximately 0.3010, the number of digits increases roughly by 0.3010 per exponent. So, for large k, the number of digits is about 0.3010k + 1. \n\nNow, if each digit from 0-9 must appear the same number of times, then the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10. Let's denote the total number of digits as N. Then N must be divisible by 10, so N = 10n for some integer n. Therefore, the number of times each digit appears is n = N/10. So, 2^k must have 10n digits, and each digit 0-9 appears exactly n times.\n\nBut here's a catch: the first digit of 2^k can't be 0. So, the digit 0 must appear n times, but the first digit is non-zero. Therefore, one of the digits (probably 0) will have one fewer occurrence in the remaining digits. Wait, but the problem states that each digit from 0-9 must appear the same number of times. So, if the first digit is non-zero, then the digit 0 must appear n times in the remaining digits. But the total number of digits is 10n, so if the first digit is non-zero, then the remaining 10n - 1 digits must include 0 n times. However, 10n - 1 is not divisible by 10 unless n=1, but 10*1 -1 =9, which isn't divisible by 10. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let's re-examine.\n\nIf the total number of digits is 10n, then each digit must appear exactly n times. But since the first digit is non-zero, the remaining 10n -1 digits must include each digit 0-9 exactly n times. However, 10n -1 is not a multiple of 10, which would require that the remaining digits have 9n zeros and 9n other digits, but that's impossible because the remaining digits are 10n -1. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me calculate:\n\nTotal digits: 10n\n\nFirst digit: non-zero, so digits 1-9. Let's say the first digit is d1, which is from 1-9. Then the remaining 10n -1 digits must include each digit 0-9 exactly n times. But in the remaining digits, there are 10n -1 digits. However, the digits 0-9 each need to appear n times in total. Since the first digit is d1 (non-zero), the remaining digits must include 0 n times, 1 n times, ..., 9 n times. But the first digit is already one of the digits 1-9, so in the remaining digits, the count for that digit is n -1, and the rest are n. But the total digits remaining are 10n -1. So:\n\nFor the digit d1: remaining digits have n -1 occurrences.\n\nFor each other digit d (≠ d1): remaining digits have n occurrences.\n\nTotal remaining digits: (n -1) + 9n = 10n -1. Which matches.\n\nBut each digit (including d1) must have exactly n occurrences in the entire number. However, the first digit is d1, so in the remaining digits, it has n -1 occurrences. Therefore, in the entire number, d1 has (n -1) +1 = n occurrences. Wait, no. Wait, the first digit is d1, which is one occurrence, and the remaining digits have n -1 occurrences. So total is 1 + (n -1) = n. That works. Similarly, for other digits, they have n occurrences entirely in the remaining digits. So, this seems possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that each digit from 0-9 must appear the same number of times. So, 0 must appear n times in the remaining digits. Therefore, in the entire number, 0 appears n times. Similarly, 1 appears n times, ..., 9 appears n times. But the first digit is non-zero, so the remaining digits have 10n -1 digits, which must include n zeros. Therefore, the number of zeros in the entire number is n, but in the remaining digits, there are n zeros. The first digit is non-zero, so the count of zeros is n, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, in principle, it's possible. But the problem is whether such a number exists. So, we need to check if there's a k such that 2^k has 10n digits, with each digit 0-9 appearing exactly n times, and the first digit is non-zero (which is automatically satisfied as 2^k is a positive integer).\n\nBut how can we approach this? It seems like a very specific condition. Powers of 2 modulo 10^n can be studied using modular arithmetic, but ensuring that each digit appears exactly n times seems very difficult. Maybe we can use some properties of numbers or apply the pigeonhole principle, but I need to think more carefully.\n\nFirst, note that for such a number, the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10, so 10n digits. The number 2^k must be between 10^{10n -1} and 10^{10n} -1. Taking logarithms, we have:\n\n10n -1 ≤ log10(2^k) < 10n\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10n -1 ≤ k log10 2 < 10n\n\nDividing by log10 2:\n\n(10n -1)/log10 2 ≤ k < 10n / log10 2\n\nSince log10 2 ≈ 0.3010, this gives:\n\n(10n -1)/0.3010 ≈ 33.222n - 3.322 ≤ k < 33.333n\n\nSo, for each n, there is an interval of k values where 2^k has 10n digits. The question is whether in any of these intervals, 2^k has all digits appearing exactly n times.\n\nBut how likely is that? For small n, maybe we can check manually. For example, let's try n=1. Then we need a number with 10 digits where each digit 0-9 appears exactly once. However, such a number would have to be a 10-digit pandigital number. However, 2^k must be a 10-digit number. Let's compute the range for k where 2^k has 10 digits.\n\nlog10(10^9) = 9, so 10^9 ≤ 2^k < 10^10\n\nTaking log10:\n\n9 ≤ k log10 2 < 10\n\nDivide by log10 2 ≈0.3010:\n\n9 /0.3010 ≈29.898 ≤k <10/0.3010≈33.222\n\nSo k=30,31,32,33.\n\nCompute 2^30=1,073,741,824 (10 digits). Check digits: 1,0,7,3,7,4,1,8,2,4. Repeats: 1 appears twice, 7 twice, 4 twice. Not pandigital.\n\n2^31=2,147,483,648. Digits: 2,1,4,7,4,8,3,6,4,8. Repeats: 4 three times, 8 twice, others once.

Repeats:8 twice, 9 three times, 5 twice, others once. Not pandigital.\n\nSo for n=1, no luck. So, n=1 is impossible.\n\nNext, n=2: 20 digits, each digit 0-9 appears twice. But 2^k would need to have 20 digits. Let's see the range for k.\n\nlog10(10^19) ≤2^k <10^20\n\n19 ≤k log10 2 <20\n\n19/0.3010≈63.123 ≤k <20/0.3010≈66.445. So k=63,64,65,66.\n\nCompute 2^63: 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. That's 19 digits. Wait, but 10^19 is 1 followed by 19 zeros, so 2^63 is just under 10^19, so it's 19 digits. So maybe k=64: 2^64=18,446,744,073,709,551,616. 18 digits. Hmm, not 20 digits. Wait, perhaps my previous calculation was off.\n\nWait, 10^10 has 11 digits. So 10^9 is 1,000,000,000 (10 digits). So 10^19 is 1 followed by 19 zeros, which is 20 digits. So 2^k must be between 10^19 and 10^20. Therefore:\n\nlog10(2^k) is between 19 and 20.\n\nThus, k is between 19 / log10 2 ≈19 /0.3010≈63.123 and 20 /0.3010≈66.445. So k=64,65,66,67.\n\nBut 2^63 is about 9.223e18, which is 19 digits. 2^64 is 1.844e19, 18 digits? Wait, no. Wait, 2^10=1024, 2^20≈1e6, 2^30≈1e9, 2^40≈1e12, 2^50≈1e15, 2^60≈1e18, 2^63≈9.223e18. So 2^63 is 19 digits. 2^64≈1.844e19, which is 20 digits. Wait, so 2^63 is 19 digits, 2^64 is 20 digits. Then 2^65≈3.689e19 (20 digits), 2^66≈7.373e19 (20 digits), 2^67≈1.474e20 (21 digits). So, in the range for n=2 (20 digits), k=64,65,66. Let's check these:\n\n2^64=18,446,744,073,709,551,616. Let's count the digits:\n\n1,8,4,4,6,7,4,4,0,7,3,7,0,9,5,5,1,6,1,6.

Also, we wrap around with \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\). Hmm, this seems like a cyclic system of equations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for any quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px + q = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -p \\) and the product is \\( q \\). Since each subsequent pair \\( (a_{i+1}, b_{i+1}) \\) are the roots of the equation with coefficient \\( a_i \\) and \\( b_i \\), this gives us relationships between consecutive terms.\n\nSpecifically, for each \\( i \\), we have:\n1. \\( a_{i+1} + b_{i+1} = -a_i \\) (sum of roots)\n2. \\( a_{i+1} \\cdot b_{i+1} = b_i \\) (product of roots)\n\nAdditionally, since \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\), the system is cyclic with period 3. That means the relationships wrap around, so we can write equations connecting \\( a_3 \\) and \\( b_3 \\) back to \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\).\n\nLet me try to write out these equations explicitly for each \\( i \\):\n\nFor \\( i = 1 \\):\n1. \\( a_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n\nFor \\( i = 2 \\):\n3. \\( a_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\)\n4. \\( a_3 \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n\nFor \\( i = 3 \\):\n5. \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\)\n6. \\( a_1 \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\)\n\nSo, we have six equations here. The challenge is to solve this system for the six variables \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 \\).\n\nLet me see if I can express all variables in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\), and then substitute back into the cyclic conditions. Let's start with the first equation:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a_2 = -a_1 - b_2 \\). Wait, but equation 2 tells us \\( a_2 \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\). So substituting \\( a_2 \\) from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n\\( (-a_1 - b_2) \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( -a_1 b_2 - b_2^2 = b_1 \\)\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n\\( b_2^2 + a_1 b_2 + b_1 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( b_2 \\). Let me note that.\n\nSimilarly, moving to the next pair, for \\( i = 2 \\):\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( a_3 = -a_2 - b_3 \\)\n\nFrom equation 4: \\( a_3 \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( a_3 \\) from equation 3 into equation 4:\n\n\\( (-a_2 - b_3) \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( -a_2 b_3 - b_3^2 = b_2 \\)\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\( b_3^2 + a_2 b_3 + b_2 = 0 \\)\n\nAgain, a quadratic in \\( b_3 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( i = 3 \\):\n\nFrom equation 5: \\( a_1 = -a_3 - b_1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 6: \\( a_1 \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( a_1 \\) from equation 5 into equation 6:\n\n\\( (-a_3 - b_1) \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( -a_3 b_1 - b_1^2 = b_3 \\)\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\( a_3 b_1 + b_1^2 + b_3 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, that's a linear equation in \\( a_3 \\), but also involving \\( a_3 \\) and \\( b_3 \\). Hmm.\n\nSo, in summary, we have three quadratic equations:\n\n1. \\( b_2^2 + a_1 b_2 + b_1 = 0 \\) (from \\( i = 1 \\))\n2. \\( b_3^2 + a_2 b_3 + b_2 = 0 \\) (from \\( i = 2 \\))\n3. \\( a_3 b_1 + b_1^2 + b_3 = 0 \\) (from \\( i = 3 \\))\n\nBut we also have expressions for \\( a_2, a_3 \\) in terms of previous variables. Let's see if we can find a recursive relation here.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a_2 = -a_1 - b_2 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( a_3 = -a_2 - b_3 \\)\n\nBut substituting \\( a_2 \\) from above into this gives:\n\n\\( a_3 = -(-a_1 - b_2) - b_3 = a_1 + b_2 - b_3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( a_3 = a_1 + b_2 - b_3 \\)\n\nNow, equation 6 (from \\( i = 3 \\)) is \\( a_1 \\cdot b_1 = b_3 \\), so \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\)\n\nTherefore, substituting \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\) into the expression for \\( a_3 \\):\n\n\\( a_3 = a_1 + b_2 - a_1 b_1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( a_3 = a_1 (1 - b_1) + b_2 \\)\n\nHmm. Let's hold onto that.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 4 from \\( i = 2 \\): \\( a_3 \\cdot b_3 = b_2 \\)\n\nBut \\( a_3 = a_1 (1 - b_1) + b_2 \\) and \\( b_3 = a_1 b_1 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( [a_1 (1 - b_1) + b_2] \\cdot a_1 b_1 = b_2 \\)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n\\( a_1 b_1 (1 - b_1) a_1 + b_2 a_1 b_1 = b_2 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) + a_1 b_1 b_2 = b_2 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can solve for \\( b_2 \\):\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) + a_1 b_1 b_2 - b_2 = 0 \\)\n\nFactor out \\( b_2 \\):\n\n\\( a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) + b_2 (a_1 b_1 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\( b_2 (a_1 b_1 - 1) = -a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( b_2 = \\frac{ -a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ a_1 b_1 - 1 } \\)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that \\( a_1 b_1 - 1 = - (1 - a_1 b_1) \\), so:\n\n\\( b_2 = \\frac{ -a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ - (1 - a_1 b_1) } = \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\)\n\nSo, \\( b_2 = \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\)\n\nHmm. That's a bit messy, but maybe manageable. Let's keep this expression for \\( b_2 \\) in mind.\n\nNow, recall from equation 2 (for \\( i = 1 \\)): \\( a_2 \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n\nBut \\( a_2 = -a_1 - b_2 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( (-a_1 - b_2) \\cdot b_2 = b_1 \\)\n\nWhich is \\( -a_1 b_2 - b_2^2 = b_1 \\)\n\nBut we have an expression for \\( b_2 \\) in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\). Let's substitute that into this equation.\n\nFirst, let's denote \\( b_2 = \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\)\n\nSo, substituting into \\( -a_1 b_2 - b_2^2 = b_1 \\):\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\n\\( -a_1 \\cdot \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } - \\left( \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\right)^2 \\)\n\nThis looks quite complicated. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\( -a_1 \\cdot \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } = - \\frac{ a_1^3 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\)\n\nSecond term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{ a_1^2 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } \\right)^2 = \\frac{ a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - b_1)^2 }{ (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 } \\)\n\nThus, LHS:\n\n\\( - \\frac{ a_1^3 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } - \\frac{ a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - b_1)^2 }{ (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 } \\)\n\nSet this equal to \\( b_1 \\):\n\n\\( - \\frac{ a_1^3 b_1 (1 - b_1) }{ 1 - a_1 b_1 } - \\frac{ a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - b_1)^2 }{ (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 } = b_1 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\( - a_1^3 b_1 (1 - b_1) (1 - a_1 b_1 ) - a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - b_1)^2 = b_1 (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( -a_1^3 b_1 (1 - b_1)(1 - a_1 b_1) \\)\n\nLet's expand \\( (1 - b_1)(1 - a_1 b_1) \\):\n\n= \\( 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot a_1 b_1 - b_1 \\cdot 1 + b_1 \\cdot a_1 b_1 \\)\n= \\( 1 - a_1 b_1 - b_1 + a_1 b_1^2 \\)\n\nSo, first term becomes:\n\n\\( -a_1^3 b_1 [1 - a_1 b_1 - b_1 + a_1 b_1^2] \\)\n= \\( -a_1^3 b_1 + a_1^4 b_1^2 + a_1^3 b_1^2 - a_1^4 b_1^3 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( -a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - b_1)^2 \\)\n\nExpand \\( (1 - b_1)^2 \\):\n\n= \\( 1 - 2 b_1 + b_1^2 \\)\n\nThus, second term becomes:\n\n\\( -a_1^4 b_1^2 (1 - 2 b_1 + b_1^2) \\)\n= \\( -a_1^4 b_1^2 + 2 a_1^4 b_1^3 - a_1^4 b_1^4 \\)\n\nThird term: \\( b_1 (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 \\)\n\nExpand \\( (1 - a_1 b_1)^2 \\):\n\n= \\( 1 - 2 a_1 b_1 + a_1^2 b_1^2 \\)\n\nThus, third term becomes:\n\n\\( b_1 (1 - 2 a_1 b_1 + a_1^2 b_1^2) \\)\n= \\( b_1 - 2 a_1 b_1^2 + a_1^2 b_1^3 \\)\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\nLeft side (after expansion):\n\nFirst term + Second term:\n= [ -a_1^3 b_1 + a_1^4 b_1^2 + a_1^3 b_1^2 - a_1^4 b_1^3 ] + [ -a_1^4 b_1^2 + 2 a_1^4 b_1^3 - a_1^4 b_1^4 ]\n\n= -a_1^3 b_1 + a_1^4 b", "answer": "Korzystając ze wzorów Viete’a warunki dane w zadaniu można zapisać jako układ równań\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \na_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\\\ \na_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\\\ \na_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\\\ \na_1 b_1 = b_3 \\\\ \na_2 b_2 = b_1 \\\\ \na_3 b_3 = b_2 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nPrzypuśćmy, że któraś z liczb \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) jest równa \\(0\\).

The smallest distinct squares are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. However, using 0 might complicate things because sums can't be too large if we want distinct squares. Alternatively, using positive squares.\n\n  Suppose we try:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & 36 \\\\\n  64 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 + 36 = 37 \\) (not a square), \\( 64 + 4 = 68 \\) (not a square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Let's try another combination:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  25 & 144 \\\\\n  16 & 49 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2 \\), \\( 16 + 49 = 65 \\) (not a square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Maybe using smaller squares:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & 4 \\\\\n  9 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 5 \\) (not a square), \\( 25 \\) (square). Column sums: \\( 1 + 9 = 10 \\) (not a square), \\( 4 + 16 = 20 \\) (not a square). Not good.\n\n  Another attempt:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  9 & 16 \\\\\n  16 & 25 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 25 \\), \\( 41 \\). Column sums: \\( 25 \\), \\( 41 \\). Sums are not distinct. Also, duplicates.\n\n  Maybe:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  36 & 1 \\\\\n  4 & 25 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 37 \\), \\( 29 \\). Column sums: \\( 40 \\), \\( 26 \\). None are squares.\n\n  This approach isn't working. Perhaps \\( n = 2 \\) is not possible. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\n  Alternatively, consider that the sums need to be distinct squares, so possible sums could be 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. For a 2x2 grid, the row sums and column sums each need to be two distinct squares. However, arranging four distinct squares such that their sums in rows and columns are also distinct squares seems difficult. Maybe it's impossible.\n\n  Let's check if it's possible with the smallest squares:\n\n  Let’s try using squares 1, 4, 9, 16.\n\n  Assign them to the grid such that row sums and column sums are squares.\n\n  Suppose the grid is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are distinct squares.\n\n  We need:\n\n  - \\( a + b = S_1 \\) (square)\n  - \\( c + d = S_2 \\) (square)\n  - \\( a + c = T_1 \\) (square)\n  - \\( b + d = T_2 \\) (square)\n  - All \\( S_1, S_2, T_1, T_2 \\) are distinct.\n\n  Let’s try assigning the smallest possible squares:\n\n  Let’s pick \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), \\( c = 9 \\), \\( d = 16 \\).\n\n  Then:\n\n  - Row sums: \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\) (not square), \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\) (square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Another arrangement:\n\n  \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 9 \\), \\( c = 16 \\), \\( d = 4 \\).\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 + 9 = 10 \\) (not square), \\( 16 + 4 = 20 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Maybe:\n\n  \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 9 \\), \\( c = 16 \\), \\( d = 25 \\).\n\n  Row sums: \\( 13 \\) (not square), \\( 41 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Alternatively, maybe use 0 as a square (0^2 = 0). If allowed, but the problem states \"parami różnych\" which translates to \"pairwise distinct\". If 0 is allowed, but maybe numbers have to be positive? The original problem says \"niekoniecznie\" – \"not necessarily\" – so maybe 0 is allowed. However, even with 0, it's challenging.\n\n  For example:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  0 & 1 \\\\\n  9 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 \\) (square), \\( 25 \\) (square). Column sums: \\( 9 \\) (square), \\( 17 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Another try with 0:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  0 & 25 \\\\\n  16 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 25 \\), \\( 25 \\). Column sums: \\( 16 \\), \\( 34 \\). Duplicate row sums.\n\n  It's starting to look like \\( n = 2 \\) might not be possible. Perhaps \\( n = 2 \\) is not a solution.\n\n- **Case \\( n = 3 \\)**:\n  - A 3x3 grid with nine distinct squares. Each row and column sum must be a distinct square.\n\n  This seems even more complex. The sums would need to be three distinct squares for rows and three for columns, all six sums being distinct. Given the flexibility with more numbers, maybe possible. But constructing such a grid is non-trivial.\n\n  Let’s attempt a small example:\n\n  Suppose we use squares 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 for the grid.\n\n  Assign them such that row sums are distinct squares, say 25, 36, 49 and column sums are distinct squares, say 16, 25, 36. But need to ensure all sums are distinct. However, arranging nine squares into a 3x3 grid with row and column sums as distinct squares is complicated.\n\n  For example, let's try:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{ccc}\n  1 & 25 & 16 \\\\\n  36 & 4 & 9 \\\\\n  25 & 16 & 49 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 + 25 + 16 = 42 \\) (not square), \\( 36 + 4 + 9 = 49 \\) (square), \\( 25 + 16 + 49 = 80 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Another try:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{ccc}\n  1 & 81 & 16 \\\\\n  25 & 36 & 16 \\\\\n  16 & 25 & 36 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  But numbers must be distinct. This approach isn't working. Maybe \\( n = 3 \\) is possible but requires a more sophisticated construction.\n\n- **Higher \\( n \\)**:\n  - As \\( n \\) increases, the number of required distinct squares grows quadratically, but the sums of rows and columns only need to be \\( 2n \\) distinct squares. This suggests that for larger \\( n \\), it might be easier to find such arrangements because there are more squares available to choose from, and the grid can be filled with larger numbers, making the sums more flexible.\n\n  However, the problem requires all numbers in the grid to be pairwise distinct. For large \\( n \\), ensuring that all \\( n^2 \\) numbers are distinct while maintaining the sum conditions might be feasible.\n\n  For example, if we use a grid where each row is a permutation of distinct squares arranged such that their sums are distinct squares. But this is vague.\n\n  Alternatively, consider that for any \\( n \\geq 3 \\), we can construct such a grid by using a sufficiently large set of squares and arranging them appropriately. However, proving the existence or non-existence for specific \\( n \\) requires more concrete reasoning.\n\n  Let's consider the parity and modular constraints. For instance, squares modulo 4 are either 0 or 1. Therefore, the sum of two squares modulo 4 can be 0, 1, or 2. But since a square number modulo 4 is either 0 or 1, the row and column sums must also be 0 or 1 modulo 4. This might impose restrictions on the possible sums.\n\n  For example, if all entries are odd squares (which are 1 mod 4), then the sum of a row or column would be \\( n \\times 1 \\mod 4 \\). If \\( n \\) is even, the sum would be 0 mod 4; if \\( n \\) is odd, the sum would be 1 mod 4. However, this might not directly apply since entries can be both even and odd squares.\n\n  Another approach is to consider that the sums must be distinct squares. The number of distinct squares available up to some limit is roughly the square root of that limit. Therefore, to have \\( 2n \\) distinct square sums, we need at least \\( 2n \\) distinct squares. For large \\( n \\), there are enough squares to choose from, making it possible to find such sums.\n\n  However, the challenge is to arrange the squares in the grid such that both row and column sums meet the criteria. This might be possible for sufficiently large \\( n \\).\n\n  On the other hand, for \\( n = 1 \\), it's trivially possible. For \\( n = 2 \\), as shown earlier, it's difficult. Let's re-examine \\( n = 2 \\) more carefully.\n\n  Suppose we use squares 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc. Let's try to find a 2x2 grid with distinct squares where row and column sums are distinct squares.\n\n  Let’s consider the following grid:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & 144 \\\\\n  64 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 + 144 = 145 \\) (not square), \\( 64 + 4 = 68 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Another attempt with larger squares:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  25 & 144 \\\\\n  16 & 49 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 169 \\) (13^2), \\( 65 \\) (not square). Column sums: \\( 41 \\) (not square), \\( 193 \\) (not square). Doesn't work.\n\n  Let’s try using 0 as a square (if allowed):\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  0 & 25 \\\\\n  16 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 25 \\), \\( 25 \\). Column sums: \\( 16 \\), \\( 34 \\). Duplicate row sums.\n\n  If 0 is not allowed, then \\( n = 2 \\) might not work. If 0 is allowed, maybe:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  0 & 1 \\\\\n  9 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 1 \\), \\( 25 \\). Column sums: \\( 9 \\), \\( 17 \\). 17 is not a square. Doesn't work.\n\n  Another try with 0:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n  0 & 4 \\\\\n  9 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n  Row sums: \\( 4 \\), \\( 25 \\).

Let me start by understanding the problem better. \n\nFirst, the equation is √(xy) = 2√x + 2√y. Because they mentioned \"nieujemne\" numbers, which I think translates to \"non-positive\" but wait, non-positive would mean non-positive, i.e., zero or negative. But since we're dealing with square roots, the expressions under the roots must be non-negative. So x and y have to be non-negative integers. That makes sense. So x and y are non-negative integers, and the equation involves square roots. \n\nSince square roots are involved, maybe squaring both sides would help eliminate them? Let me try that. \n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\n√(xy) = 2√x + 2√y.\n\nIf I square both sides, I get:\n\n(√(xy))² = (2√x + 2√y)².\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nxy = (2√x + 2√y)².\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, factor out the 2: (2(√x + √y))² = 4(√x + √y)².\n\nThen expand the square: 4[(√x)² + 2√x√y + (√y)²] = 4[x + 2√(xy) + y].\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nxy = 4x + 8√(xy) + 4y.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange terms:\n\nxy - 4x - 4y = 8√(xy).\n\nThis still looks complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let me let t = √(xy). Then, since x and y are non-negative integers, t is a non-negative real number. But maybe t must be an integer? Because if x and y are integers, then xy is an integer, so √(xy) is either irrational or integer. However, in the original equation, √x and √y are added together, which would be irrational unless x and y are perfect squares. Therefore, maybe x and y are perfect squares? Let me check that.\n\nSuppose x and y are perfect squares. Let x = a² and y = b² where a and b are non-negative integers. Then the original equation becomes:\n\n√(a²b²) = 2√(a²) + 2√(b²).\n\nSimplify:\n\nab = 2a + 2b.\n\nSo ab - 2a - 2b = 0.\n\nAdding 4 to both sides:\n\nab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4.\n\nFactor the left-hand side:\n\n(a - 2)(b - 2) = 4.\n\nAh, this looks like a standard factoring problem. So (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4. Since a and b are non-negative integers, (a - 2) and (b - 2) must be integer divisors of 4. Also, since a and b are non-negative, (a - 2) and (b - 2) can be positive or negative, but their product is 4. Let's list all pairs of integers (m, n) such that m * n = 4.\n\nThe integer pairs (m, n) are:\n\n(1, 4), (2, 2), (4, 1), (-1, -4), (-2, -2), (-4, -1).\n\nTherefore, translating back to a and b:\n\nFor each pair (m, n):\n\na - 2 = m\n\nb - 2 = n\n\nSo:\n\n1. m = 1, n = 4:\n\na = 3, b = 6\n\n2. m = 2, n = 2:\n\na = 4, b = 4\n\n3. m = 4, n = 1:\n\na = 6, b = 3\n\n4. m = -1, n = -4:\n\na = 1, b = -2. But b must be non-negative, so this is invalid.\n\n5. m = -2, n = -2:\n\na = 0, b = 0\n\n6. m = -4, n = -1:\n\na = -2, b = 1. Both a and b must be non-negative, so invalid.\n\nSo the valid solutions are:\n\n1. a = 3, b = 6: x = 9, y = 36\n\n2. a = 4, b = 4: x = 16, y = 16\n\n3. a = 6, b = 3: x = 36, y = 9\n\nAdditionally, from case 5: a = 0, b = 0: x = 0, y = 0\n\nWait, but in case 5, a = 0, so x = 0, and b = 0, y = 0. Let's check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: √(0*0) = √0 + √0 + √0 + √0 → 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 → 0 = 0. That works.\n\nSimilarly, the other solutions:\n\nFor x = 9, y = 36:\n\nLeft-hand side: √(9*36) = √324 = 18\n\nRight-hand side: 2√9 + 2√36 = 2*3 + 2*6 = 6 + 12 = 18. That works.\n\nFor x = 16, y = 16:\n\nLeft-hand side: √(16*16) = √256 = 16\n\nRight-hand side: 2√16 + 2√16 = 2*4 + 2*4 = 8 + 8 = 16. That works.\n\nFor x = 36, y = 9:\n\nSame as x=9, y=36, which works.\n\nSo these are valid solutions.\n\nBut wait, are there any other solutions where x or y is zero but not both? Let's check.\n\nSuppose x = 0 and y is a non-negative integer.\n\nOriginal equation becomes √(0*y) = √0 + √0 + √y + √y → 0 = 0 + 0 + √y + √y → 0 = 2√y → √y = 0 → y = 0.\n\nSo the only solution when x=0 is y=0. Similarly, if y=0, x must be 0. So the only solution with a zero is (0,0).\n\nBut what if x or y is zero but not both? Wait, if x=0 and y≠0, then the equation becomes √0 = 0 + 0 + √y + √y → 0 = 2√y, which implies y=0. Similarly, if y=0 and x≠0, same result. So the only solution with a zero is (0,0).\n\nTherefore, the solutions we found earlier are the only ones where x and y are perfect squares. But is that all?\n\nWait, maybe there are solutions where x and y are not perfect squares. Let me think. Suppose x and y are not perfect squares, but their product is a perfect square. For example, x=2 and y=8. Then √(xy) = √16 = 4. On the right-hand side: 2√2 + 2√8 = 2√2 + 2*2√2 = 2√2 + 4√2 = 6√2 ≈ 8.485, which is not 4. So that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe x and y are such that √x and √y are rational numbers but not integers. For instance, if x and y are squares of rational numbers, but since x and y are integers, they must be perfect squares. Because if √x is rational, then x must be a perfect square. Because x is an integer, if √x is rational, then √x is integer. Wait, is that true?\n\nYes, actually. If x is an integer and √x is rational, then √x must be an integer. Because suppose √x = a/b where a and b are coprime integers. Then x = a²/b², so b² divides a². Since a and b are coprime, b must be 1, so √x is integer. Therefore, √x and √y must be integers. Therefore, x and y must be perfect squares. Therefore, the only solutions are the ones where x and y are perfect squares, which we found earlier. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are (0,0), (9,36), (36,9), and (16,16). Wait, but let's check if there are any other solutions when a and b are non-negative integers. The equation (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4. We considered all integer pairs (m, n) such that m * n = 4. But maybe there are other factorizations? For example, if we consider that m and n can be in any order, but we already considered all ordered pairs. \n\nWait, 4 can also be written as (-1)*(-4), (-2)*(-2), (-4)*(-1). But as we saw earlier, these lead to negative a or b, which are invalid because x and y must be non-negative. So the only valid solutions are the ones we found: (3,6), (4,4), (6,3) leading to (9,36), (16,16), (36,9), and (0,0). \n\nBut let's verify once again. Let me list all possible factor pairs of 4 (both positive and negative):\n\n(1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-1,-4), (-2,-2), (-4,-1).\n\nEach of these gives:\n\nFor (1,4):\n\na = 1 + 2 = 3, b = 4 + 2 = 6 → (3,6) → (9,36)\n\nFor (2,2):\n\na = 4, b = 4 → (16,16)\n\nFor (4,1):\n\na = 6, b = 3 → (36,9)\n\nFor (-1,-4):\n\na = -1 + 2 = 1, b = -4 + 2 = -2 → invalid because b is negative\n\nFor (-2,-2):\n\na = 0, b = 0 → (0,0)\n\nFor (-4,-1):\n\na = -2 + 2 = 0, b = -1 + 2 = 1 → invalid because a is zero but then x would be zero, y=1. Wait, hold on. If a=0, then x=0, and if b=1, y=1. Wait, but in this case, a - 2 = -4, so a = -4 + 2 = -2? Wait, no. Wait, the substitution is a - 2 = m, so if m = -4, then a = -4 + 2 = -2. But a must be non-negative, so invalid. Similarly, if m = -1, a = -1 + 2 = 1. Wait, no. Wait, let's go back.\n\nOriginal substitution: (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4. So for each factor pair (m, n) of 4, we set m = a - 2, n = b - 2. So:\n\nIf (m, n) = (-1, -4), then a = -1 + 2 = 1, b = -4 + 2 = -2. But b is negative, so invalid.\n\nIf (m, n) = (-2, -2), then a = -2 + 2 = 0, b = -2 + 2 = 0. Both a and b are non-negative, so (0,0).\n\nIf (m, n) = (-4, -1), then a = -4 + 2 = -2, b = -1 + 2 = 1. But a is negative, invalid.\n\nSo only (0,0) comes from negative factors. So indeed, the only solutions are (9,36), (36,9), (16,16), and (0,0). \n\nBut let's check (0,0). If x=0 and y=0, then √(0*0)=√0 + √0 + √0 + √0 → 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nIs there a possibility that x or y is zero but not both? Let's check. If x=0 and y≠0, then equation becomes 0 = 0 + 0 + √y + √y → 0 = 2√y → y=0. Similarly, if y=0 and x≠0, x must be zero. So (0,0) is the only solution with a zero.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the pairs are (0,0), (9,36), (36,9), and (16,16). \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other factorizations. For example, 4 can be written as ( -1 ) * ( -4 ), but as we saw, these lead to negative a or b. What about fractions? But since a and b are integers (as x and y are integers, so a = √x must be integer), we don't need to consider fractions. So no, those are all the possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach the problem differently. Let's suppose that x and y are non-negative integers satisfying √(xy) = 2(√x + √y). Let me set u = √x and v = √y. Then x = u², y = v², where u and v are non-negative integers. Then the equation becomes uv = 2(u + v). So uv - 2u - 2v = 0. Adding 4 to both sides: uv - 2u - 2v + 4 = 4. Then factor: (u - 2)(v - 2) = 4. Which is exactly the same as before. So this is the same equation. Therefore, the solutions for u and v are the same as before, leading to x and y as squares. Therefore, the solutions are as found.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the pairs (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), and (36,9). \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"nieujemne\" numbers,", "answer": "Jedynymi parami nieujemnych liczb całkowitych \\( x, y \\) spełniającymi dane równanie są: \\( (0, 0), (9, 16) \\) i \\( (16, 9) \\)."}

That symmetry might be helpful. Maybe the solutions are also symmetric? Let me check if x = y = z is a possible solution.\n\nLet's assume x = y = z = k. Then substitute into the first equation:\n\n\\( k^2 * k + 2 = k + 2 * k * k \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( k^3 + 2 = k + 2k^2 \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( k^3 - 2k^2 - k + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe rational roots? The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2.\n\nTesting k=1: 1 - 2 -1 +2 = 0. Oh, k=1 is a root.\n\nSo factor out (k - 1):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide \\( k^3 - 2k^2 -k +2 \\) by (k -1):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -2 | -1 | 2\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next term: -2 +1 = -1. Multiply by 1: -1. Add to next term: -1 + (-1) = -2. Multiply by 1: -2. Add to last term: 2 + (-2) = 0. So quotient is k^2 - k -2.\n\nThus, \\( (k -1)(k^2 -k -2) = 0 \\). Factor the quadratic: k^2 -k -2 = (k -2)(k +1). So roots are k=1, k=2, k=-1.\n\nTherefore, if x = y = z, possible solutions are 1, 2, -1. Let's check each in the original equation.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nLeft side: 1^2 *1 +2 = 1 +2 =3. Right side:1 + 2*1*1 =1 +2=3. Okay, works.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nLeft side: 2^2*2 +2 =8 +2=10. Right side:2 +2*2*2=2+8=10. Good.\n\nFor k=-1:\n\nLeft side: (-1)^2*(-1) +2 =1*(-1) +2= -1 +2=1. Right side: -1 +2*(-1)*(-1)= -1 +2(1)= -1 +2=1. Correct.\n\nSo symmetric solutions are (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (-1,-1,-1). But maybe there are other solutions where x, y, z are not equal. Let's check.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say x = y ≠ z. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nSet x = y = a, z = b.\n\nThen first equation becomes:\n\n\\( a^2 *a +2 = a + 2*a*b \\)\n\nWhich is \\( a^3 +2 = a + 2ab \\)\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( a^2 * b +2 = a + 2*b*a \\)\n\nWhich is \\( a^2 b +2 = a + 2ab \\)\n\nThird equation:\n\n\\( b^2 *a +2 = b + 2*a*a \\)\n\nWhich is \\( a b^2 +2 = b + 2a^2 \\)\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. \\( a^3 +2 = a + 2ab \\) -- Equation (1)\n\n2. \\( a^2 b +2 = a + 2ab \\) -- Equation (2)\n\n3. \\( a b^2 +2 = b + 2a^2 \\) -- Equation (3)\n\nLet me try to subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\nEquation (1) - Equation (2):\n\n\\( a^3 - a^2 b = a - a \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a^3 - a^2 b =0 \\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\( a^2 (a - b) =0 \\)\n\nSo either a=0 or a = b.\n\nIf a=0, then from Equation (1):\n\n0 +2 =0 +0 → 2=0, which is impossible. So a ≠0, hence a = b.\n\nBut if a = b, then z = a, so x = y = z =a, which is the symmetric case we already considered. So in this case, assuming x = y leads to the symmetric solution. Therefore, maybe there are no solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where all variables are different. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to subtract equations pairwise.\n\nTake Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n\nEquation 1: \\( x^2 y +2 = x + 2 y z \\)\n\nEquation 2: \\( y^2 z +2 = y + 2 z x \\)\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\n\\( x^2 y - y^2 z +0 = x - y + 2 y z - 2 z x \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( y(x^2 - y z) = x - y + 2 z (y - x) \\)\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe factor terms:\n\nLeft side: \\( y x^2 - y^2 z \\)\n\nRight side: \\( x - y - 2 z x + 2 z y \\)\n\nNot obvious. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\n\\( x^2 y - y^2 z - x + y + 2 z x - 2 z y =0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\nGroup x^2 y - x, -y^2 z + y, 2 z x -2 z y\n\nx(x y -1) - y(y z -1) + 2 z (x - y) =0\n\nNot sure if helpful. Alternatively, factor y from the first two terms:\n\ny(x^2 - y z) -x + y + 2 z (x - y) =0\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that all equations are cyclic. Maybe we can consider variables in a cyclic manner. Let's denote the equations as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3.\n\nLet me try to express each equation in terms of the next variable.\n\nFrom Eq1: \\( x^2 y = x + 2 y z -2 \\)\n\nSimilarly, from Eq2: \\( y^2 z = y + 2 z x -2 \\)\n\nFrom Eq3: \\( z^2 x = z + 2 x y -2 \\)\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFor example, divide Eq1 by Eq2:\n\n\\( \\frac{x^2 y}{y^2 z} = \\frac{x + 2 y z -2}{y + 2 z x -2} \\)\n\nSimplify left side: \\( \\frac{x^2}{y z} \\)\n\nRight side: \\( \\frac{x + 2 y z -2}{y + 2 z x -2} \\)\n\nNot sure if helpful. Alternatively, cross-multiplied:\n\nx^2 y (y + 2 z x -2) = y^2 z (x + 2 y z -2 )\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: x^2 y * y + x^2 y * 2 z x - x^2 y *2 = x^2 y^2 + 2 x^3 y z - 2 x^2 y\n\nRight side: y^2 z *x + y^2 z *2 y z - y^2 z *2 = x y^2 z + 2 y^3 z^2 - 2 y^2 z\n\nSo set left = right:\n\nx^2 y^2 + 2 x^3 y z - 2 x^2 y = x y^2 z + 2 y^3 z^2 - 2 y^2 z\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^2 y^2 - x y^2 z + 2 x^3 y z - 2 y^3 z^2 -2 x^2 y +2 y^2 z =0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nx y^2 (x - z) + 2 y z (x^2 y - y^2 z) -2 y^2 (x^2 - z )=0\n\nWait, maybe it's too messy. Perhaps this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for substitutions. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to rearrange each equation.\n\nFrom Eq1:\n\nx^2 y - 2 y z = x -2\n\nSimilarly, Eq2:\n\ny^2 z -2 z x = y -2\n\nEq3:\n\nz^2 x -2 x y = z -2\n\nHmm. So each equation is of the form variable^2 * next variable - 2 * next variable * previous variable = variable -2.\n\nNot sure. Maybe factor variables.\n\nFor example, from Eq1:\n\ny (x^2 - 2 z ) = x -2\n\nSimilarly, Eq2:\n\nz (y^2 - 2 x ) = y -2\n\nEq3:\n\nx (z^2 - 2 y ) = z -2\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. \\( y(x^2 - 2z) = x -2 \\)\n\n2. \\( z(y^2 - 2x) = y -2 \\)\n\n3. \\( x(z^2 - 2y) = z -2 \\)\n\nThis seems symmetric. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s define A = x^2 - 2z, B = y^2 - 2x, C = z^2 - 2y.\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. y A = x -2\n\n2. z B = y -2\n\n3. x C = z -2\n\nBut A, B, C are related to x, y, z. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each equation as:\n\ny = (x -2)/(x^2 - 2z)\n\nz = (y -2)/(y^2 - 2x)\n\nx = (z -2)/(z^2 - 2y)\n\nThis seems recursive. Maybe substitute one into another.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me see if I can find a pattern or substitute variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that none of x, y, z are zero. Maybe that's an assumption we can make?\n\nWait, if x=0, then from Eq1:\n\n0 +2 =0 +0 → 2=0, which is impossible. Similarly, if y=0, then from Eq2: 0 +2=0 +0→2=0, same with z=0. So none of x, y, z can be zero. So we can safely divide by x, y, z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom Eq1: y = (x -2)/(x^2 - 2z)\n\nFrom Eq2: z = (y -2)/(y^2 - 2x)\n\nFrom Eq3: x = (z -2)/(z^2 - 2y)\n\nThis system is cyclic. Maybe substitute recursively.\n\nLet me try substituting y from Eq1 into Eq2.\n\nSo y = (x -2)/(x^2 -2z). Plug this into Eq2:\n\nz = [ ( (x -2)/(x^2 -2z) ) -2 ] / [ ( (x -2)/(x^2 -2z) )^2 -2x ]\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possibility that x, y, z are all equal to 1, 2, -1 as found before, but are there other solutions?\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that x, y, z are all equal. Wait, we already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are negatives? For example, x = -y, y = -z, etc. But this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if we multiply all three equations together.\n\nLeft sides: (x^2 y +2)(y^2 z +2)(z^2 x +2)\n\nRight sides: (x + 2yz)(y + 2zx)(z + 2xy)\n\nBut multiplying these out would be very tedious. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that each equation has the form: variable squared times next variable plus 2 equals variable plus 2 times next variable times previous variable.\n\nLet me think of variables as a cycle: x → y → z → x.\n\nSo, perhaps each term can be related through this cycle.\n\nLet me try to express each equation as:\n\nx^2 y - 2 y z = x - 2\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny^2 z - 2 z x = y - 2\n\nz^2 x - 2 x y = z - 2\n\nIf we denote these as:\n\nEquation 1: x^2 y - 2 y z - x + 2 =0\n\nEquation 2: y^2 z - 2 z x - y +2=0\n\nEquation 3: z^2 x - 2 x y - z +2=0\n\nNow, perhaps add all three equations:\n\n(x^2 y - 2 y z -x +2) + (y^2 z -2 z x - y +2) + (z^2 x -2 x y - z +2) =0\n\nSo sum is:\n\nx^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x -2 y z -2 z x -2 x y -x -y -z +6 =0\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe factor terms.\n\nAlternatively, group terms:\n\nx^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x -2(xy + yz + zx) - (x + y + z) +6 =0\n\nNot obvious. Maybe consider symmetric sums. Let S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, Q = xyz.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, maybe look for substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we set a = x -1, b = y -1, c = z -1. Maybe shifting variables.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there are solutions where one variable is 1, another is 2, another is -1. For example, maybe (1, 2, -1). Let's test this.\n\nCheck in the first equation:\n\nx=1, y=2, z=-1.\n\nLeft: 1^2 *2 +2 = 2 +2=4\n\nRight:1 +2*2*(-1)=1 -4= -3\n\n4 ≠ -3. Not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe permutations of (1,2,-1). Let's try x=", "answer": "\bJedynymi trójkami x, y, z spełniającymi dane równania są: (-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)."}

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let's try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that functional equations often require testing specific values for x and y to simplify the equation and find patterns or possible forms of f. Let me start by plugging in some simple values, like x = 0 or y = 0, to see if that gives me any insights.\n\nLet’s set x = 0 and y = 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(0) + f(0)) + c*0*0 = f(0 + 0)\nSimplifying, that's f(2f(0)) = f(0)\n\nSo, f(2f(0)) = f(0). That tells me that either 2f(0) = 0, which would mean f(0) = 0, or that f is not injective (since there are two different inputs giving the same output). But I don't know yet if f is injective. Maybe I can find more information by choosing other values.\n\nLet’s try setting y = 0 and keeping x arbitrary. Then the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x) + f(0)) + c*x*0 = f(x + 0)\nSimplifying, that's f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(x)\n\nSimilarly, if I set x = 0 and vary y, I get:\n\nf(f(0) + f(y)) + c*0*y = f(0 + y)\nWhich simplifies to f(f(0) + f(y)) = f(y)\n\nSo both f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(x) and f(f(0) + f(y)) = f(y) hold for all x and y. This suggests that adding f(0) to the argument of f and then applying f again doesn't change the result. That seems like a kind of idempotent property. Maybe f is a linear function? Let me test that hypothesis.\n\nSuppose f is linear, so f(x) = ax + b for some constants a and b. Let's substitute this into the original equation and see what conditions we get on a, b, and c.\n\nFirst, compute f(f(x) + f(y)):\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) = a*(f(x) + f(y)) + b = a*(a x + b + a y + b) + b = a*(a(x + y) + 2b) + b = a²(x + y) + 2ab + b\n\nThen, the left side of the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + c x y = a²(x + y) + 2ab + b + c x y\n\nThe right side is f(x + y) = a(x + y) + b\n\nSo setting them equal:\n\na²(x + y) + 2ab + b + c x y = a(x + y) + b\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n(a² - a)(x + y) + 2ab + c x y = 0\n\nThis must hold for all real numbers x and y. Let's analyze the coefficients. The term with x y is c x y, so unless c = 0, this term can't be canceled out. Therefore, we must have c = 0. But if c = 0, then the equation reduces to:\n\n(a² - a)(x + y) + 2ab = 0\n\nAgain, for this to hold for all x and y, the coefficients of x + y and the constant term must both be zero. Thus:\n\na² - a = 0 ⇒ a(a - 1) = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or a = 1\n\nAnd 2ab = 0. If a = 0, then 2ab = 0 holds regardless of b. If a = 1, then 2ab = 2b = 0 ⇒ b = 0.\n\nSo, possible linear functions are:\n\n1. a = 0, then f(x) = 0*x + b = b. Then check if this works.\n\nWait, if f is a constant function, say f(x) = b for all x, then let's substitute into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: f(f(x) + f(y)) + c x y = f(b + b) + c x y = f(2b) + c x y = b + c x y\n\nRight side: f(x + y) = b\n\nSo the equation becomes b + c x y = b ⇒ c x y = 0 for all x, y. This is only possible if c = 0. So if c = 0, then any constant function f(x) = b would satisfy the equation. Wait, but if c = 0, then f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + y). If f is constant, then f(x + y) = b, and f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(2b) = b, so that works. But if f is a linear function with a = 0, then f(x) = b, which is a constant function. So for c = 0, there exists such a function (constant functions). But if a = 1 and b = 0, then f(x) = x. Let's check this.\n\nIf f(x) = x, then substitute into the original equation with c = 0:\n\nLeft side: f(f(x) + f(y)) + 0 = f(x + y) = x + y\n\nRight side: f(x + y) = x + y. So yes, that works. Therefore, when c = 0, both constant functions and the identity function satisfy the equation. Interesting.\n\nBut earlier, when we considered c ≠ 0, we saw that c must be zero. Wait, no. Wait, when we assumed f is linear, we found that c must be zero. But maybe there are non-linear solutions when c is not zero? Wait, but the problem is asking for all real numbers c for which there exists at least one function f. So even if for some c there are no linear solutions, but there might be non-linear ones.\n\nBut perhaps c must be zero? Let's see.\n\nWait, let's recap. When we set x = 0 and y = 0, we found that f(2f(0)) = f(0). If f is injective (one-to-one), then this would imply 2f(0) = 0, so f(0) = 0. But injectivity is not given. However, if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(2f(0)) = f(0). But without knowing more about f, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find f(0). Let's denote d = f(0). Then from x = 0, y = 0: f(2d) = d.\n\nFrom setting y = 0, we have f(f(x) + d) = f(x) for all x. Similarly, setting x = 0, we get f(d + f(y)) = f(y) for all y.\n\nSo, f(f(x) + d) = f(x) and f(d + f(y)) = f(y). This looks like a kind of shift invariance. Maybe f is additive or multiplicative? Not sure.\n\nSuppose we assume f is linear, which we did earlier, but that led to c = 0. But maybe there are non-linear solutions. Let's try to see.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider differentiating or assuming f is quadratic. Wait, but the problem is over real numbers, and we don't know if f is differentiable. Maybe we need another approach.\n\nLet me try to find f(0). Let’s denote d = f(0). Then, from the equation when x = 0, y = 0: f(2d) = d.\n\nAlso, from the equation when y = 0: f(f(x) + d) = f(x). Let’s set x = 0 here: f(f(0) + d) = f(0) ⇒ f(d + d) = d ⇒ f(2d) = d, which is consistent with the previous result.\n\nSimilarly, setting x = -y, maybe? Let's try x = -y. Then the original equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x) + f(-x)) + c x (-x) = f(0)\n\nSo, f(f(x) + f(-x)) - c x² = f(0)\n\nHmm, this relates the value of f at x and -x to a quadratic term. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider setting y = x. Then the equation becomes:\n\nf(2f(x)) + c x² = f(2x)\n\nBut I don't know if that helps immediately.\n\nWait, if I can find an expression for f(2x), maybe in terms of f(f(x)), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if f is additive. Suppose f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y). Then, the original equation would be:\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + c x y = f(x) + f(y)\n\nBut if f is additive, then f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(f(y)). So substituting:\n\nf(f(x)) + f(f(y)) + c x y = f(x) + f(y)\n\nBut unless f is linear, this might not hold. Let’s suppose f is linear, which we already considered earlier, leading to c = 0.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f is affine, i.e., f(x) = a x + b. Wait, we tried that already. The only solutions were when c = 0, either with a = 0 (constant function) or a = 1 and b = 0 (identity function).\n\nBut maybe there are non-linear solutions. Let's try to see.\n\nSuppose f is a quadratic function, say f(x) = a x² + b x + c. Then, substituting into the equation might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nFirst, compute f(f(x) + f(y)):\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) = a(f(x) + f(y))² + b(f(x) + f(y)) + c\n\nExpanding that:\n\n= a[(a x² + b x + c) + (a y² + b y + c)]² + b[(a x² + b x + c) + (a y² + b y + c)] + c\n\nThis seems very messy. The left side of the equation would then have terms up to degree 8 (since squaring the quadratic gives degree 4, then multiplied by a quadratic function gives degree 6?), which seems too high compared to the right side f(x + y) = a(x + y)² + b(x + y) + c, which is degree 2. Therefore, unless a = 0, which reduces to the linear case, quadratic functions are unlikely to satisfy the equation. So maybe non-linear solutions are not possible unless c = 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find all real numbers c for which there exists at least one function f. So perhaps c = 0 is the only possible value? But we need to confirm that.\n\nWait, let's check if there are non-linear solutions when c ≠ 0. Suppose c ≠ 0. Let's see if we can derive a contradiction.\n\nEarlier, when we set y = 0, we have f(f(x) + d) = f(x), where d = f(0). Similarly, setting x = 0 gives f(d + f(y)) = f(y). Let’s denote this property as f(f(x) + d) = f(x) for all x.\n\nNow, suppose that f is surjective. Then for any real number z, there exists some x such that f(x) = z. If f is surjective, then for any z, there exists x with f(x) = z. Let’s take z = f(x) + d. Then, there exists x such that f(x) + d = z. But not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that f is injective. Then, from f(f(x) + d) = f(x), injectivity would imply f(x) + d = x for all x. Therefore, f(x) = x - d. Let’s check if this works.\n\nIf f(x) = x - d, then let's substitute into the original equation. First, compute f(f(x) + f(y)):\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) = f((x - d) + (y - d)) = f(x + y - 2d) = (x + y - 2d) - d = x + y - 3d\n\nThen, the left side of the equation is:\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + c x y = x + y - 3d + c x y\n\nThe right side is f(x + y) = (x + y) - d\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nx + y - 3d + c x y = x + y - d\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3d + c x y = -d ⇒ c x y - 2d = 0\n\nFor this to hold for all x and y, we must have c = 0 and -2d = 0 ⇒ d = 0. So if f is injective and linear, then f(x) = x - d. But this only works if c = 0 and d = 0, meaning f(x) = x. Which is the identity function, which we saw earlier works when c = 0.\n\nTherefore, if c ≠ 0, even if f is injective and linear, we can't have a solution. Therefore, perhaps c must be 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"for all x, y ∈ R\" there exists such a function f. So, if c = 0, then as we saw, both constant functions and the identity function work. Therefore, c = 0 is possible. Now, is there any other c ≠ 0 for which such a function exists?\n\nSuppose c ≠ 0. Let's try to see if we can find a contradiction.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + c x y = f(x + y)\n\nLet’s consider setting x = -y. Then:\n\nf(f(x) + f(-x)) + c x (-x) = f(0)\n\nSo:\n\nf(f(x) + f(-x)) - c x² = f(0)\n\nBut unless we know more about f(x) and f(-x), this might not help. Let's think of another substitution.\n\nSuppose we set y = 1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x) + f(1)) + c x = f(x + 1)\n\nSimilarly, if we set y = -1:\n\nf(f(x) + f(-1)) - c x = f(x - 1)\n\nBut without knowing specific values, this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's", "answer": "**Rozwiązanie:**  \nUdowodnimy, że jedyną liczbą rzeczywistą \\( c \\), dla której istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach jest \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nPo pierwsze zauważmy, że jeżeli \\( c = 0 \\), to dowolna funkcja stała spełnia warunki zadania.  \nNiech \\( c > 0 \\) będzie taką liczbą rzeczywistą, że istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach.

The problem is asking whether there exist three different non-zero real numbers a, b, c such that among the three fractions given:\n\n(a + b)/(a² + ab + b²), (b + c)/(b² + bc + c²), (c + a)/(c² + ca + a²),\n\ntwo are equal and the third is different. Hmm. So, we need to find such a, b, c or prove that they don't exist.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try to find some relationships or symmetries here. The denominators are symmetric in the variables. For example, the denominator of the first fraction is a² + ab + b², which is symmetric in a and b. Similarly for the others. The numerators are also sums of two variables.\n\nSince the problem is symmetric, maybe we can assume some relation between a, b, c. For instance, maybe two of them are related in a certain way. Let's suppose that two of the fractions are equal. Let's say the first two are equal:\n\n(a + b)/(a² + ab + b²) = (b + c)/(b² + bc + c²)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n(a + b)(b² + bc + c²) = (b + c)(a² + ab + b²)\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\na*b² + a*b*c + a*c² + b*b² + b*b*c + b*c²\n\nRight side:\n\nb*a² + b*ab + b*b² + c*a² + c*ab + c*b²\n\nSimplify both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\na b² + a b c + a c² + b³ + b² c + b c²\n\nRight side:\n\nb a² + a b² + b³ + c a² + a b c + c b²\n\nNow, subtract the right side from the left side to see what we get.\n\nLeft - Right:\n\n(a b² + a b c + a c² + b³ + b² c + b c²) - (b a² + a b² + b³ + c a² + a b c + c b²)\n\nLet's cancel terms:\n\na b² cancels with -a b²,\n\na b c cancels with -a b c,\n\nb³ cancels with -b³,\n\nb² c cancels with -c b²,\n\nSo remaining terms:\n\na c² - c a² + b c² - c b²\n\nFactor terms:\n\na c² - c a² = a c² - a² c = a c (c - a)\n\nSimilarly, b c² - c b² = b c² - b² c = b c (c - b)\n\nSo overall:\n\na c (c - a) + b c (c - b) = 0\n\nFactor out c:\n\nc [a(c - a) + b(c - b)] = 0\n\nSince c is non-zero (given), we can divide both sides by c:\n\na(c - a) + b(c - b) = 0\n\nExpand:\n\na c - a² + b c - b² = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(a + b)c - (a² + b²) = 0\n\nSo:\n\n(a + b)c = a² + b²\n\nTherefore, from this equation, we can express c in terms of a and b:\n\nc = (a² + b²)/(a + b)\n\nHmm. Interesting. So if we set c as (a² + b²)/(a + b), then the first two fractions are equal. Now, we need to check whether the third fraction, which is (c + a)/(c² + c a + a²), is different from the first two. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute c + a:\n\nc + a = (a² + b²)/(a + b) + a = [a² + b² + a(a + b)]/(a + b) = [a² + b² + a² + a b]/(a + b) = [2a² + a b + b²]/(a + b)\n\nSimilarly, compute c² + c a + a²:\n\nFirst, compute c²:\n\nc² = [(a² + b²)/(a + b)]² = (a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴)/(a + b)²\n\nThen, c a = a*(a² + b²)/(a + b) = (a³ + a b²)/(a + b)\n\nSo c² + c a + a² = (a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴)/(a + b)² + (a³ + a b²)/(a + b) + a²\n\nThis looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way to compute this. Let's factor the denominator expression for the third fraction. Remember, the denominator is c² + c a + a². Let's see if this can be related to the expression we found for c.\n\nWe had c = (a² + b²)/(a + b). Let's compute c² + c a + a²:\n\nFirst, compute c²:\n\n= [(a² + b²)/(a + b)]² = (a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴)/(a + b)²\n\nThen, c a = a*(a² + b²)/(a + b) = (a³ + a b²)/(a + b)\n\nSo, adding c² + c a + a²:\n\n= (a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴)/(a + b)² + (a³ + a b²)/(a + b) + a²\n\nTo combine these terms, let's get a common denominator of (a + b)²:\n\n= [a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴ + (a³ + a b²)(a + b) + a² (a + b)²]/(a + b)²\n\nNow, expand the numerator:\n\nFirst term: a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴\n\nSecond term: (a³ + a b²)(a + b) = a³*a + a³*b + a b²*a + a b²*b = a⁴ + a³ b + a² b² + a b³\n\nThird term: a² (a + b)² = a² (a² + 2a b + b²) = a⁴ + 2a³ b + a² b²\n\nNow, add all three terms together:\n\nFirst term: a⁴ + 2a² b² + b⁴\n\nSecond term: + a⁴ + a³ b + a² b² + a b³\n\nThird term: + a⁴ + 2a³ b + a² b²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na⁴ terms: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3a⁴\n\na³ b terms: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3a³ b\n\na² b² terms: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4a² b²\n\na b³ terms: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nb⁴ terms: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1b⁴\n\nSo total numerator:\n\n3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴\n\nHmm. Let me check if this can be factored. Let's see.\n\nFirst, group terms:\n\n3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴\n\nHmm. Maybe factor by grouping. Let's see.\n\nGroup first two terms and next three terms:\n\n(3a⁴ + 3a³ b) + (4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴)\n\nFactor out 3a³ from first group: 3a³(a + b)\n\nFactor second group: b²(4a² + a b + b²)\n\nHmm. Not sure if helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor as a polynomial in terms of a/b or b/a.\n\nAlternatively, note that if we set t = a/b, then the expression becomes:\n\n3t⁴ + 3t³ + 4t² + t + 1\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, check if this is a perfect square or something. Let's try:\n\nSuppose 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴. Let's see if it factors as (a + b)(something). Let's try:\n\nMultiply (a + b)(3a³ + 2a² b + 2a b² + b³):\n\n= a*(3a³ + 2a² b + 2a b² + b³) + b*(3a³ + 2a² b + 2a b² + b³)\n\n= 3a⁴ + 2a³ b + 2a² b² + a b³ + 3a³ b + 2a² b² + 2a b³ + b⁴\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3a⁴ + (2a³ b + 3a³ b) + (2a² b² + 2a² b²) + (a b³ + 2a b³) + b⁴\n\n= 3a⁴ + 5a³ b + 4a² b² + 3a b³ + b⁴\n\nHmm, that's not the same as the numerator we had. Our numerator was 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴. So the coefficients of a³ b and a b³ are different. Therefore, that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (a² + ab + b²)^2. Let's check:\n\n(a² + ab + b²)^2 = a^4 + 2a³ b + 3a² b² + 2a b³ + b^4\n\nCompare to our numerator: 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴. Not quite. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the numerator as (a + b)(something). Let's try dividing the numerator by (a + b):\n\nUsing polynomial division. Let's divide 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴ by (a + b).\n\nSet t = a, and consider the polynomial in t: 3t⁴ + 3t³ b + 4t² b² + t b³ + b⁴. Divide by (t + b).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nRoot at t = -b. Let's plug t = -b into the polynomial:\n\n3(-b)^4 + 3(-b)^3 b + 4(-b)^2 b² + (-b) b³ + b⁴\n\n= 3b⁴ - 3b⁴ + 4b⁴ - b⁴ + b⁴ = (3 -3 +4 -1 +1)b⁴ = 4b⁴ ≠ 0\n\nTherefore, not divisible by (a + b). So that approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator factors as (a² + ab + b²)(something). Let's see:\n\nSuppose (a² + ab + b²)(A a² + B a b + C b²). Multiply out:\n\n= A a⁴ + (B + A) a³ b + (C + A) a² b² + (B + A) a b³ + C b⁴\n\nSet equal to 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴\n\nSo equate coefficients:\n\nA = 3\n\nB + A = 3 ⇒ B = 0\n\nC + A = 4 ⇒ C = 1\n\nB + A = 3 ⇒ B = 0 (consistent)\n\nC = 1\n\nTherefore, (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + 0 a b + 1 b²) = (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²)\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n= a²*(3a² + b²) + ab*(3a² + b²) + b²*(3a² + b²)\n\n= 3a⁴ + a² b² + 3a³ b + a b³ + 3a² b² + b⁴\n\n= 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + (1 + 3)a² b² + a b³ + b⁴\n\n= 3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴\n\nYes! So the numerator factors as (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²). Therefore, the denominator c² + c a + a² = (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²)/(a + b)².\n\nWait, no. Wait, we had:\n\nc² + c a + a² = [3a⁴ + 3a³ b + 4a² b² + a b³ + b⁴]/(a + b)² = (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²)/(a + b)²\n\nBut the numerator factors as (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²). Therefore, the denominator expression is [(a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²)]/(a + b)².\n\nTherefore, the third fraction (c + a)/(c² + c a + a²) is equal to:\n\n[ (2a² + ab + b²)/(a + b) ] divided by [ (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²)/(a + b)² ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (2a² + ab + b²)/(a + b) ] * [ (a + b)² / ( (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²) ) ]\n\n= (2a² + ab + b²)(a + b) / ( (a² + ab + b²)(3a² + b²) )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2a² + ab + b².

Rozstrzygnąć, czy α musi być liczbą wymierną.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if α has to be a rational number given that the tangent of α times π is equal to the square root of 2. Hmm, let's start by writing down the given equation: tan(απ) = √2. The question is asking whether α must necessarily be rational. \n\nFirst, I recall that the tangent function has a period of π, so tan(θ) = tan(θ + kπ) for any integer k. But here, the argument is απ, so maybe we can think of α as being in some interval and then adding multiples of 1 (since if α is shifted by an integer, then απ is shifted by kπ, and the tangent would repeat). Wait, actually, if α is a real number, then απ is just some real number, and tan(απ) = √2. So we can represent α as (arctan(√2) + kπ)/π, where k is an integer. That is, α = (arctan(√2)/π) + k, where k is an integer. \n\nBut is arctan(√2) a rational multiple of π? If arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π, then α would be rational plus an integer, hence rational. But if arctan(√2) is an irrational multiple of π, then α would be irrational. So the key here is to determine whether arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π. \n\nWait, but how do we know if arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π? That's the crux of the problem. I remember that some arctangent values are rational multiples of π, like arctan(1) = π/4, but others are not. For example, arctan(√3) is π/3, which is also a rational multiple. But arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, right? I think that's a result from transcendental number theory. \n\nLet me recall some theorems. There's Niven's theorem which states that the only rational values of θ in radians for which tan(θ) is rational are those where θ is a multiple of π/4. But here, we have tan(απ) = √2, which is irrational. Niven's theorem applies to rational multiples of π giving rational tangents, but √2 is irrational. So that theorem doesn't directly apply here. \n\nAlternatively, there's the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which says that if α is a non-zero algebraic number, then e^(iα) is transcendental. But how does that relate to tan(απ)? Maybe not directly. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and tan(απ) would be tan(rational * π). But when is tan(rational * π) algebraic? For example, tan(π/4) = 1, tan(π/6) = 1/√3, tan(π/3) = √3. So in those cases, the tangent is algebraic. But √2 is also algebraic. So is there a rational multiple of π whose tangent is √2? \n\nAlternatively, if we suppose that α is rational, then α = p/q for integers p and q. Then tan(pπ/q) = √2. But I need to check if such p and q exist. For example, is there a rational number p/q such that tan(pπ/q) = √2? \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Gelfond-Schneider theorem. That theorem states that if a is algebraic not 0 or 1, and b is algebraic irrational, then a^b is transcendental. But I'm not sure how to apply that here. \n\nWait, but let's think about the equation tan(θ) = √2. We can write this as sin(θ)/cos(θ) = √2, so sin(θ) = √2 cos(θ). Then, using the identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1, substitute sin(θ) = √2 cos(θ):\n\n(√2 cos(θ))^2 + cos^2(θ) = 1\n2 cos^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\n3 cos^2(θ) = 1\ncos^2(θ) = 1/3\ncos(θ) = ±1/√3\n\nSimilarly, sin(θ) = √2/√3 or -√2/√3. So θ is an angle whose cosine is ±1/√3 and sine is ±√2/√3. Therefore, θ is equal to arccos(1/√3) plus multiples of 2π or with appropriate signs. But does arccos(1/√3) correspond to a rational multiple of π?\n\nAlternatively, if θ = arccos(1/√3), is θ a rational multiple of π? That's the key question. If yes, then α would be rational. If no, then α could be irrational. \n\nI think that arccos(1/√3) is not a rational multiple of π. This is related to the fact that cos(θ) = 1/√3 is not a constructible number, or perhaps it's transcendental? Wait, 1/√3 is algebraic, but does that imply that θ is transcendental? \n\nBy the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, if θ is a non-zero algebraic number, then cos(θ) is transcendental. But 1/√3 is algebraic, so if θ were algebraic, then cos(θ) would be transcendental, which contradicts cos(θ) = 1/√3. Therefore, θ must be transcendental. Therefore, θ is not a rational multiple of π, since all rational multiples of π are algebraic. \n\nTherefore, θ = arccos(1/√3) is transcendental, hence not a rational multiple of π. Therefore, α = θ/π is also transcendental, hence irrational. Therefore, α must be irrational. \n\nWait, but hold on. The problem states that α is a real number such that tan(απ) = √2. So, α could be θ/π, where θ is arccos(1/√3) plus any integer multiple of 2π, right? Because tan(θ) has period π, so θ + kπ would have the same tangent. But since θ is transcendental, adding integer multiples of 2π (which is algebraic) would still result in a transcendental number.

So, we need to find all real numbers C such that for any integer n ≥ 2, there exists a bad subset X of the n×n chessboard that has at most Cn² squares. A bad subset X is one where every cycle on the chessboard contains at least one square from X. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly. A cycle here is a sequence of squares where each consecutive pair shares a common edge, and the last one connects back to the first. The cycle has to be of length at least 4. So, every such cycle must have at least one square from X. Our task is to find the smallest possible C such that such a subset X exists for every n.\n\nHmm. So, for each n, we need to cover all cycles with a subset X that's as small as possible, proportional to Cn². The question is asking for the minimal C such that this is possible for all n.\n\nI remember that in graph theory, a chessboard can be represented as a grid graph where each square is a vertex connected to its neighbors. Cycles in this graph correspond to closed walks of even length (since each move alternates between black and white squares). However, the problem specifies cycles of length at least 4. So, in graph terms, we need to cover all cycles of length ≥4 with a subset of vertices (squares) X, such that every such cycle contains at least one vertex from X. And we need the size of X to be at most Cn².\n\nThis seems related to the concept of a feedback vertex set in graph theory, which is a set of vertices whose removal breaks all cycles. However, in this case, we don't need to remove the vertices, just select a set X such that every cycle (of length ≥4) contains at least one vertex from X. So, X is a kind of hitting set for cycles of length ≥4.\n\nIn grid graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is studied, but I'm not sure about the exact results for grid graphs. However, maybe there's a way to construct such a set X with a small density.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a covering problem. Each square in X can \"cover\" all cycles that pass through it. So, we need to cover all cycles with as few squares as possible.\n\nBut how many cycles are there in an n×n grid? That's probably too many to handle directly. Instead, perhaps we can find a pattern or a structure that allows us to place squares in such a way that each square covers a large number of cycles.\n\nIn a chessboard, a common structure to consider is a checkerboard coloring, where squares are colored alternately black and white. In such a coloring, any cycle must alternate between black and white squares. Since cycles must alternate colors, all cycles must have even length. However, the problem specifies cycles of length at least 4, so cycles of length 4, 6, etc. \n\nIf we take all black squares, then any cycle must contain at least two black squares (since it alternates colors). Wait, but actually, in a 4-cycle, you can have two black and two white squares. So, if X is the set of all black squares, then any cycle of length 4 will contain two black squares, so X would certainly hit every cycle. However, the size of X would be roughly half the total squares, so C would be 1/2. But maybe we can do better.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal C such that such a subset X exists for every n. So, perhaps the answer is 1/2, but maybe it's less. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if we use a more efficient hitting set. For example, if we can find a set X such that every cycle of length ≥4 contains at least one square from X, and X is as small as possible.\n\nIn grid graphs, a feedback vertex set (FVS) is a set of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic. The size of the smallest FVS in an n×n grid graph is known? I recall that for planar graphs, the FVS can be bounded, but maybe not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a line or diagonal to hit all cycles. For example, if we place a line of squares (a row, column, or diagonal) such that every cycle must pass through it. But in a grid graph, cycles can wind around, so a single row or column might not be sufficient.\n\nWait, but if we take all squares in a single row, that's n squares. Then, any cycle that doesn't use that row would have to go around it. But cycles can be anywhere. However, a cycle must have even length. If we have a cycle that doesn't use a particular row, it must loop around, but maybe the parity of the rows affects this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more efficient approach is to use a set of squares spaced out in such a way that every cycle must pass near one of them. For example, if we create a \"cross\" in the center, with horizontal and vertical lines. But a cross would cover more squares and might not be efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that in any cycle of length ≥4, there must be a square in X such that the square is part of the cycle and breaks the cycle if removed. But since we can't remove squares, we need a hitting set.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a dual of the feedback vertex set. Instead of removing vertices to break cycles, we select vertices such that every cycle contains at least one selected vertex. So, X is a hitting set for cycles.\n\nIn graph theory, the minimum hitting set for cycles is equivalent to the minimum feedback vertex set. But in grid graphs, perhaps there are specific structures that allow for a smaller hitting set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the chessboard as a bipartite graph, with black and white squares. Then, any cycle must alternate between black and white. If we can cover all black squares with a set X, then since cycles alternate colors, any cycle must contain a black square. Wait, but if X is the set of all black squares, then any cycle must contain at least two black squares. But actually, in a 4-cycle, you can have two black and two white squares, so if X is all black squares, then the cycle would contain two black squares, so X would intersect the cycle. Similarly, any cycle must contain at least two black squares, which are in X. Therefore, X being all black squares would work, but the size is about half the board, so C=1/2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimal C. Maybe we can do better than 1/2. For example, if we can find a set X where each square in X \"covers\" more cycles.\n\nWait, if we place X in such a way that every cycle must pass through at least one square in X. For example, if we place X as a set of squares spaced in both directions. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we divide the chessboard into 2x2 blocks. In each 2x2 block, there are four squares. If we place one square in each 2x2 block, then any cycle that is entirely within a 2x2 block would have to include the placed square. However, cycles can be larger and cross multiple blocks. So, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, if we place a square in every other cell in both rows and columns. For example, a checkerboard pattern but with a different frequency. Wait, but a checkerboard pattern is what we already considered, with density 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, if we use a more efficient pattern. For example, in each 3x3 block, place a certain number of squares such that any cycle within the 3x3 block must contain at least one of them, and then use periodicity to tile the board. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in order to cover all cycles, we need to ensure that there's no cycle that doesn't contain any square from X. So, X must intersect every possible cycle.\n\nIn grid graphs, a cycle can be of various lengths. The smallest cycles are 4-cycles (squares), 6-cycles (rectangle with extra squares), etc. To cover all cycles, X must intersect every possible such cycle.\n\nOne approach is to use a set of squares that form a \"barrier\" between different parts of the grid. For example, if we place a horizontal line of squares in the middle of the grid, then any cycle that goes from the top half to the bottom half must pass through the barrier. Similarly, a vertical line would do the same for left and right halves. However, a single horizontal or vertical line might not be sufficient because a cycle can go around the barrier.\n\nWait, but if we have both horizontal and vertical barriers, arranged in a grid, forming a grid of barriers. Hmm, maybe like a grid where every other row and column is blocked. But that might be too many.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a graph and use the concept of a vertex cover. But a vertex cover in a grid graph is a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the set. However, this is different from a hitting set for cycles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the concept of a separating set. A set X such that the removal of X disconnects the graph. But again, this is different from a hitting set for cycles.\n\nWait, another thought: In a grid graph, any cycle must enclose at least one square. Wait, no. A cycle in a grid graph is a closed path without repeating edges or vertices. The area enclosed by the cycle can be a single square or multiple squares. Wait, in a grid graph, a cycle that forms the boundary of a 2x2 square would enclose one square inside. But a larger cycle could enclose multiple squares. Wait, maybe not necessarily.\n\nWait, perhaps in grid graphs, cycles can be formed in such a way that they don't enclose any squares. For example, a cycle that goes around the perimeter of the chessboard. But that perimeter is a cycle of length 4n, which encloses n² - 1 squares. Wait, no. The perimeter of an n×n chessboard is 4n - 4, and it encloses (n - 1)² squares. So, the cycle itself is the perimeter, and the enclosed squares are inside. But in terms of the problem, the cycle is the sequence of squares, not the enclosed area. So, a cycle can be the perimeter, which doesn't enclose any squares, but in terms of the problem, the cycle is just the sequence of squares, and X needs to hit every such cycle.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that any cycle must have a certain density. For example, in order to form a cycle of length k ≥4, you need at least k/2 squares. Wait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of duality. If we can model this as a hypergraph where each cycle is a hyperedge containing all its squares, then we need a hitting set for this hypergraph. The problem reduces to finding the minimum hitting set for the hypergraph of all cycles of length ≥4 in the grid graph.\n\nHitting set problems are generally NP-hard, but for specific structures like grid graphs, there might be known results or efficient constructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a probabilistic method. If we randomly select each square with probability p, then the expected number of squares in X is pn². The expected number of cycles not hit by X is the number of cycles times the probability that none of their squares are in X. If we can choose p such that this expectation is less than 1, then there exists a cycle not hit by X, which is bad. So, to ensure that all cycles are hit, we need the expectation to be less than 1. However, this would give us an upper bound on C.\n\nBut perhaps this approach can give us a bound. Let's try.\n\nFirst, let's estimate the number of cycles of length k in an n×n grid. For a grid graph, the number of cycles can be quite complex, but maybe we can approximate.\n\nFor 4-cycles (squares), the number is (n - 1)^2. For each internal square, there is a 4-cycle around it. So, total 4-cycles: (n - 1)^2.\n\nFor 6-cycles, these can be formed by a rectangle of size 2x3, with an extra square. The number is more complicated, but perhaps exponential in n.\n\nBut maybe instead of exact counts, use an upper bound. Let's suppose that the number of cycles of length ≥4 is exponential in n, but each cycle has at least 4 squares. Then, the probability that a random set X of size pn² hits all cycles is something like exp(-pn² * number_of_cycles * (1 - p)^4). If we set this to be less than 1, then we can solve for p. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each square is in roughly 4 cycles (for 4-cycles). But cycles can overlap. Maybe this approach is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the grid's dimensions. If we place every other square in both rows and columns, forming a grid of selected squares spaced two apart, then any cycle of length 4 must pass through at least one selected square. Wait, let's check this.\n\nSuppose we select every second square in both directions. So, in an n×n grid, if n is even, we can select (n/2)^2 squares. If n is odd, we can select ((n-1)/2)^2. But this might not cover all cycles. For example, a 4-cycle in the middle might not contain any selected squares.\n\nAlternatively, if we select all squares of one color in a checkerboard pattern, which gives about half the squares. Then, as before, any cycle must alternate colors, so a cycle of even length must have half black and half white. Therefore, if X is all black squares, then any cycle must contain at least two black squares, hence intersecting X. Therefore, C=1/2 works.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimal C. Is 1/2 the minimal, or can we do better?\n\nSuppose we can find a set X where each square in X is in \"many\" cycles, so that each square can \"cover\" many cycles. If we can arrange X such that each square covers a constant number of cycles, then the size of X would be proportional to the total number of cycles divided by the number of cycles each square covers.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we use a diagonal line. If we select all squares on a diagonal, how many cycles does that intersect? A diagonal of length n in an n×n grid. A cycle might pass through the diagonal, but unless the cycle is confined to a small area around the diagonal, it might not intersect. For example, a cycle that snakes around the diagonal might not intersect it. So, a diagonal is insufficient.\n\nSimilarly, a single row or column would be insufficient because cycles can be placed away from them.\n\nAlternatively, if we select every other square in a row, forming a sparse set. Then, a cycle passing through that row must pass through one of the selected squares. But again, cycles can go around the selected squares.\n\nWait, perhaps a better", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że wszystkie liczby \\(C \\geq \\frac{1}{3}\\) spełniają warunki zadania.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since P and Q are polynomials, their compositions and squares will also be polynomials. The equations given relate the values of P and Q at certain points, so maybe I can equate the degrees of both sides to get some constraints on the degrees of P and Q. That seems like a good starting point.\n\nLet's denote the degree of P as m and the degree of Q as n. Then, let's analyze the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)² + 2x. On the left side, substituting x² + 1 into a polynomial of degree m will result in a polynomial of degree 2m. On the right side, Q(x)² is a polynomial of degree 2n, and adding 2x (which is degree 1) won't increase the degree beyond 2n. Therefore, the leading term of Q(x)² must be the same as the leading term of P(x² + 1). Similarly, the degrees must be equal, so 2m = 2n, which implies m = n. So the degrees of P and Q must be equal.\n\nNow, looking at the leading coefficients. Let's suppose that P(x) has leading coefficient a and Q(x) has leading coefficient b. Then, the leading term of P(x² + 1) is a*(x² + 1)^m. The leading term of Q(x)² is b²*(x)^{2n} = b²*x^{2m} (since n = m). Therefore, equating the leading terms:\n\na*(x²)^m = b²*x^{2m}\n\nWhich simplifies to a*x^{2m} = b²*x^{2m}, so a = b².\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2. The left side is Q(x² + 1), which has leading term b*(x² + 1)^m, so leading term b*x^{2m}. The right side is P(x)^2, which has leading term a²*x^{2m}. Therefore, equating leading coefficients:\n\nb*x^{2m} = a²*x^{2m} => b = a².\n\nBut from the first equation, we had a = b². So substituting b = a² into a = b², we get a = (a²)² = a⁴. Therefore, a⁴ - a = 0 => a(a³ - 1) = 0. Since we are dealing with real coefficients, a can be 0 or 1 (since 1³ - 1 = 0). But if a = 0, then from b = a², b = 0. Let's check if a = 0 is possible.\n\nIf a = 0, then from the first equation, P(x) is the zero polynomial. Then Q(x)² + 2x = 0 for all x. But Q(x)² is non-negative for real x, and 2x can be positive or negative. So Q(x)² + 2x = 0 implies that Q(x)² = -2x. However, the left side is non-negative and the right side is non-positive only when x ≤ 0. But since this must hold for all real x, this is impossible. Therefore, a = 0 is invalid. Thus, a must be 1. Then, from a = 1, we get b = a² = 1. So both P and Q have leading coefficient 1.\n\nSo far, we know that both P and Q are polynomials of the same degree m, with leading coefficient 1. Let's try to find possible polynomials.\n\nLet me consider the case where m = 0. That is, both P and Q are constants. Then, the equations become:\n\nP(x² + 1) = Q² + 2x. But if P is constant, then the left side is a constant, while the right side is Q² + 2x, which is linear in x. This can't hold for all x unless the coefficient of x is zero, but 2x is present. Therefore, m = 0 is impossible.\n\nNext, consider m = 1. So both P and Q are linear polynomials. Let me write them as:\n\nP(x) = x + c\n\nQ(x) = x + d\n\nWhere c and d are constants. Let's substitute into the first equation:\n\nP(x² + 1) = (x² + 1) + c = x² + 1 + c\n\nOn the other hand, Q(x)² + 2x = (x + d)² + 2x = x² + 2dx + d² + 2x = x² + (2d + 2)x + d²\n\nSetting these equal for all x:\n\nx² + (1 + c) = x² + (2d + 2)x + d²\n\nTherefore, equating coefficients:\n\nFor x²: 1 = 1, which is okay.\n\nFor x: 0 = 2d + 2 => 2d + 2 = 0 => d = -1\n\nConstants: 1 + c = d². Since d = -1, d² = 1, so 1 + c = 1 => c = 0\n\nSo P(x) = x + 0 = x, Q(x) = x - 1.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2\n\nLeft side: Q(x² + 1) = (x² + 1) - 1 = x²\n\nRight side: P(x)^2 = (x)^2 = x². So this holds. Therefore, (P, Q) = (x, x - 1) is a solution.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other solutions with m = 1. Suppose that P and Q are linear, but maybe with different coefficients. Wait, but we derived that if m = 1, then c must be 0 and d must be -1. So that's the only solution for m = 1.\n\nNow, let's check m = 2. So both P and Q are quadratic polynomials. Let me write them as:\n\nP(x) = x² + ax + b\n\nQ(x) = x² + cx + d\n\nSince the leading coefficients are 1. Let's substitute into the first equation:\n\nP(x² + 1) = (x² + 1)^2 + a(x² + 1) + b\n\nExpanding:\n\n= x⁴ + 2x² + 1 + a x² + a + b\n\n= x⁴ + (2 + a)x² + (1 + a + b)\n\nOn the other hand, Q(x)^2 + 2x = (x² + cx + d)^2 + 2x\n\nExpanding:\n\n= x⁴ + 2cx³ + (c² + 2d)x² + 2cdx + d² + 2x\n\n= x⁴ + 2cx³ + (c² + 2d)x² + (2cd + 2)x + d²\n\nSet them equal for all x:\n\nx⁴ + (2 + a)x² + (1 + a + b) = x⁴ + 2cx³ + (c² + 2d)x² + (2cd + 2)x + d²\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nx⁴: 1 = 1, okay.\n\nx³: 0 = 2c => c = 0\n\nx²: 2 + a = c² + 2d. Since c = 0, this becomes 2 + a = 0 + 2d => 2 + a = 2d\n\nx term: 0 = 2cd + 2. Since c = 0, this becomes 0 = 0 + 2 => 0 = 2, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no solution exists for m = 2.\n\nHmm, so m = 2 is impossible. Let's check m = 3. Wait, but maybe there's a pattern here. For m = 1, we had a solution, but for m = 2, we get a contradiction. Let me see if there's a way to generalize this.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a recursive structure here. Let me think. Suppose that P and Q are polynomials of degree m, with leading coefficient 1. Then, from the first equation, P(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x. The left side has degree 2m, and the right side has degree 2n, but since m = n, same degree. But when m = 1, we found a solution. For m = 2, we saw that there's a contradiction because the coefficient of x term leads to 0 = 2. Maybe this contradiction arises for higher degrees as well?\n\nWait, let's check m = 3. Let me try m = 3. Let P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, Q(x) = x³ + dx² + ex + f. But this might get too complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the only solution is m = 1. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a functional equation here. Let's consider the two equations:\n\nP(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x\n\nQ(x² + 1) = P(x)^2\n\nIf we substitute the second equation into the first, perhaps we can find a relation. Let's see:\n\nFrom the second equation, Q(x)^2 = Q(x² + 1). Wait, no, Q(x)^2 = P(x)^2 from the second equation. Wait, the second equation says Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2. So Q(x)^2 is not necessarily equal to P(x)^2, unless x² + 1 is related to some substitution. Hmm, maybe we can iterate these equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider x as a variable and substitute specific values. For example, set x = 0. Then:\n\nP(0² + 1) = Q(0)^2 + 0 => P(1) = Q(0)^2\n\nSimilarly, Q(0² + 1) = P(0)^2 => Q(1) = P(0)^2\n\nSo we have:\n\nP(1) = Q(0)^2\n\nQ(1) = P(0)^2\n\nLet me denote P(0) = a and Q(0) = b. Then:\n\nP(1) = b²\n\nQ(1) = a²\n\nBut since P and Q are polynomials with leading coefficient 1, let's see what P(0) and Q(0) are. For example, for m = 1, P(x) = x + c, so P(0) = c, and Q(x) = x + d, Q(0) = d. Then from above, P(1) = 1 + c = b², Q(1) = 1 + d = a². But in our previous solution, when m = 1, c = 0 and d = -1. Then P(1) = 1 + 0 = 1 = (-1)^2 = Q(0)^2, which is correct. Q(1) = 1 + (-1) = 0 = (1)^2 = P(0)^2. So that checks out.\n\nBut maybe if I can set up a system where P(1) = Q(0)^2 and Q(1) = P(0)^2. If I iterate this, perhaps I can get a recursive relation. For example, if I let a = P(0), then Q(1) = a². Then, if I compute P(1) = Q(0)^2. But Q(0) is related to Q's coefficients. Wait, this might not lead me anywhere immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that P and Q satisfy some functional equation. For instance, if we substitute x with some function of x in the equations. Let me think. Suppose we take the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2. Then, substitute x with Q(y). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, substitute x with sqrt(t - 1), assuming t ≥ 1. But maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider composing the two equations. Let's substitute the second equation into the first. From the first equation, P(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x. From the second equation, Q(x)^2 = P(x)^2. Therefore, substituting into the first equation, we get P(x² + 1) = P(x)^2 + 2x. Wait, that's interesting. So P(x² + 1) = P(x)^2 + 2x. Similarly, from the second equation, Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2. But since P(x)^2 = Q(x² + 1), and from the first equation, Q(x)^2 = P(x² + 1) - 2x. So substituting Q(x² + 1) into that, we might get some relation. But perhaps this is not simplifying things.\n\nWait, but if we look at the equation P(x² + 1) = P(x)^2 + 2x, this resembles the functional equation for a certain type of polynomial. Maybe P is a linear polynomial, as we saw. Let's check for m = 1, we have P(x) = x. Then P(x² + 1) = x² + 1, and P(x)^2 + 2x = x² + 2x. Wait, but these are not equal. Wait, hold on, in our previous solution, we had P(x) = x and Q(x) = x - 1. Then, P(x² + 1) = x² + 1, and Q(x)^2 + 2x = (x - 1)^2 + 2x = x² - 2x + 1 + 2x = x² + 1, which matches. Then, Q(x² + 1) = (x² + 1) - 1 = x², which is P(x)^2 = x². So that works.\n\nBut according to the equation P(x² + 1) = P(x)^2 + 2x, which would be x² + 1 = x² + 2x, which is not true. Wait, but in reality, in the solution, Q(x)^2 + 2x = P(x² + 1). But Q(x)^2 = P(x)^2, so P(x² + 1) = P(x)^2 +", "answer": "Mamy \\(2x + Q(x)^2 = P(x^2 + 1) = P((-x)^2 + 1) = Q((-x)^2 - 2x\\),  \nzatem \\(4x = Q(-x)^2 - Q(x)^2 = Q(x)(Q(-x) - Q(x))\\).  \nWynika stąd, że jeden z wielomianów \\(Q(-x) - Q(x), Q(-x) + Q(x)\\) jest stopnia \\(0\\), a drugi — stopnia \\(1\\).

The system has n variables and n equations, with n being at least 2. Let me try to understand the structure of these equations first.\n\nEach equation in the system is of the form: 2x_i³ + 4 = x_i²(x_{i+1} + 3). For the last equation, it wraps around to connect x_n back to x_1. So, the equations are cyclic, meaning the solution should probably be symmetric in some way. Maybe all variables are equal? Let me check that possibility first because symmetric solutions are often a good starting point.\n\nAssume that all variables are equal, so x₁ = x₂ = ... = x_n = c. Then each equation becomes 2c³ + 4 = c²(c + 3). Let's substitute that in:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): 2c³ + 4\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): c²(c + 3) = c³ + 3c²\n\nSet them equal:\n\n2c³ + 4 = c³ + 3c²\n\nSubtract RHS from both sides:\n\n2c³ + 4 - c³ - 3c² = c³ - 3c² + 4 = 0\n\nSo we need to solve c³ - 3c² + 4 = 0.\n\nHmm, let's factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTesting c = -1: (-1)³ - 3(-1)² + 4 = -1 - 3 + 4 = 0. Oh, c = -1 is a root.\n\nSo (c + 1) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nDivide c³ - 3c² + 4 by (c + 1):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n-1 | 1  -3   0   4\n\n          -1   4  -4\n\n      1  -4   4   0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (c + 1)(c² - 4c + 4) = 0\n\nThen, factor the quadratic: c² - 4c + 4 = (c - 2)²\n\nThus, the equation factors to (c + 1)(c - 2)² = 0. Therefore, the roots are c = -1 and c = 2 (double root).\n\nSo if all variables are equal, possible solutions are c = -1 or c = 2. Let me check these in the original equation to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nFirst, c = -1:\n\nLHS: 2*(-1)^3 + 4 = 2*(-1) + 4 = -2 + 4 = 2\n\nRHS: (-1)^2*(-1 + 3) = 1*(2) = 2\n\nOkay, that works.\n\nNow c = 2:\n\nLHS: 2*(2)^3 + 4 = 2*8 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nRHS: (2)^2*(2 + 3) = 4*5 = 20\n\nThat also works. So both c = -1 and c = 2 are solutions when all variables are equal.\n\nBut the problem says \"n ≥ 2\", so n can be 2, 3, etc. Are there other solutions where variables are not all equal?\n\nHmm, the question is asking to solve the system, so we need to check if there are non-symmetric solutions. However, given the cyclic nature, it's often the case that symmetric solutions are the only solutions. Let me test for n = 2 first, maybe that can give me some insight.\n\nFor n = 2, the system becomes:\n\n2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n\n2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₁ + 3)\n\nIf we assume x₁ = x₂ = c, then as before, c = -1 or 2. But maybe there are other solutions where x₁ ≠ x₂.\n\nLet me try to solve the system for n = 2. Let's denote the equations:\n\n1) 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n\n2) 2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₁ + 3)\n\nLet me try to express x₂ from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²x₂ + 3x₁²\n\nBring terms involving x₂ to one side:\n\nx₁²x₂ = 2x₁³ + 4 - 3x₁²\n\nThus,\n\nx₂ = (2x₁³ + 4 - 3x₁²)/x₁² = 2x₁ + (4 - 3x₁²)/x₁²\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n(2x₁³)/x₁² = 2x₁\n\n4/x₁² = 4/x₁²\n\n(-3x₁²)/x₁² = -3\n\nSo x₂ = 2x₁ - 3 + 4/x₁²\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\nx₁ = (2x₂³ + 4 - 3x₂²)/x₂² = 2x₂ - 3 + 4/x₂²\n\nSo substituting x₂ from equation 1 into equation 2 would lead to a very complicated equation. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we let x₁ = a and x₂ = b. Then we have:\n\n2a³ + 4 = a²(b + 3) --> 2a³ + 4 = a²b + 3a²\n\nSimilarly, 2b³ + 4 = b²a + 3b²\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nFrom first equation: a²b = 2a³ + 4 - 3a² --> b = (2a³ + 4 - 3a²)/a² = 2a + (4 - 3a²)/a² = 2a - 3 + 4/a²\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: b²a = 2b³ + 4 - 3b² --> a = (2b³ + 4 - 3b²)/b² = 2b - 3 + 4/b²\n\nSo substituting b from the first equation into the second equation would give an equation in terms of a. However, this seems very messy. Let me attempt it.\n\nLet me denote b = 2a - 3 + 4/a²\n\nThen substitute this into the expression for a:\n\na = 2b - 3 + 4/b²\n\nSubstitute b:\n\na = 2*(2a - 3 + 4/a²) - 3 + 4/(2a - 3 + 4/a²)^2\n\nThis is going to be a very complicated equation. Maybe instead of trying to solve it directly, let's check if the symmetric solutions satisfy this.\n\nWe already know that a = b = -1 and a = b = 2 are solutions. Let's see if there could be other solutions.\n\nSuppose a = -1, then b = 2*(-1) - 3 + 4/((-1)^2) = -2 - 3 + 4 = -5 + 4 = -1. So b = -1, which matches the symmetric solution.\n\nIf a = 2, then b = 2*2 - 3 + 4/(2²) = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2. So again, symmetric solution.\n\nBut maybe there are other real solutions. Let's suppose a ≠ b. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set a = b, but we already did that. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where variables alternate between two values. For example, in n=2, maybe x₁ = c and x₂ = d, then x₁ = c, x₂ = d, x₁ = c, etc., which for n=2, would still be the same as symmetric solution. But for higher n, alternation could occur. However, since the problem allows n ≥ 2, maybe for any n, the only solutions are the symmetric ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system is designed such that regardless of n, the only solutions are all variables equal to -1 or 2. Let me check for n=3.\n\nFor n=3, the system is:\n\n1) 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n\n2) 2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₃ + 3)\n\n3) 2x₃³ + 4 = x₃²(x₁ + 3)\n\nIf we assume all variables are equal, x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = c, then we have the same equation as before, leading to c = -1 or 2. But maybe there are other solutions where variables are not all equal. Let's suppose x₁, x₂, x₃ are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each variable relates to the next in a cycle, so if we have x₁, then x₂ is determined by x₁, x₃ by x₂, and x₁ by x₃. This is similar to a cyclic system where each variable is a function of the previous. So, if we start with x₁, we can compute x₂ from the first equation, then x₃ from the second, and then x₁ from the third. If we substitute back, we get an equation in x₁ only.\n\nLet me try this approach for n=3.\n\nStarting with x₁, we can express x₂ from equation 1:\n\nFrom equation 1: x₂ = (2x₁³ + 4)/x₁² - 3 = 2x₁ + 4/x₁² - 3\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: x₃ = (2x₂³ + 4)/x₂² - 3\n\nThen from equation 3: x₁ = (2x₃³ + 4)/x₃² - 3\n\nSo substituting x₂ into x₃, and then x₃ into x₁, we get an equation solely in terms of x₁. However, this would be a very high-degree equation, likely of degree 9 or higher, which is difficult to solve. So perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can be transformed into a single equation by substitution, but it's not obvious. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we consider the function f(x) = (2x³ + 4)/(x²) - 3. Then, the system is x_{i+1} = f(x_i), with x_{n+1} = x₁. So, the system is equivalent to x₁ = f(f(...f(x₁)...)), n times. So, we're looking for fixed points of the function f composed n times. However, fixed points of the composition might include the fixed points of f itself, which are the solutions we found earlier (x = -1 and x = 2). But there might be other periodic points of period n.\n\nBut since the problem is to solve the system for any n ≥ 2, perhaps the only solutions are the symmetric ones. To verify this, let's test for n=2 if there are non-symmetric solutions.\n\nLet me try n=2 again. Suppose x₁ ≠ x₂. Let me see if such solutions exist.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3) --> x₂ = (2x₁³ + 4)/x₁² - 3 = 2x₁ + 4/x₁² - 3\n\nFrom equation 2: x₁ = (2x₂³ + 4)/x₂² - 3\n\nSubstitute x₂ from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\nx₁ = [2*(2x₁ + 4/x₁² - 3)³ + 4]/[(2x₁ + 4/x₁² - 3)²] - 3\n\nThis looks very complicated, but let me compute step by step.\n\nLet me denote y = x₁ for simplicity.\n\nThen x₂ = 2y + 4/y² - 3\n\nCompute numerator: 2*(2y + 4/y² - 3)^3 + 4\n\nDenominator: (2y + 4/y² - 3)^2\n\nSo x₁ = [2*(2y + 4/y² - 3)^3 + 4]/[(2y + 4/y² - 3)^2] - 3\n\nSimplify numerator / denominator:\n\nLet me compute (2y + 4/y² - 3)^3 first. Let me denote A = 2y - 3, B = 4/y², so x₂ = A + B\n\nThen (A + B)^3 = A³ + 3A²B + 3AB² + B³\n\nSo numerator becomes 2*(A³ + 3A²B + 3AB² + B³) + 4\n\nDenominator is (A + B)^2 = A² + 2AB + B²\n\nThis seems too tedious. Maybe instead of expanding, let's substitute x₁ = -1 and x₂ = -1 into this equation to check if it works, but we already know that works. What about x₁ = 2 and x₂ = 2, that also works.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if there are other real solutions. Suppose y is some other value.

First, f(0) has to be greater than 0. Second, for every integer k, the smallest value among all f(k - l) + f(l) for any integer l must equal f(k). Hmm, let's try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words. We need a function f: Z → N (where N includes zero here, since they say \"nieujemna\" which is non-negative) such that f(0) > 0, and for every integer k, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) over all l is exactly f(k). That seems like a recursive condition because f(k) is defined in terms of other values of f. Interesting.\n\nLet me start by considering some simple functions. Maybe a constant function? Let's suppose f(k) = c for all k, where c is a non-negative integer. Then, for any k and any l, f(k - l) + f(l) = c + c = 2c. So the minimal value would be 2c. But according to the second condition, this minimal value should be f(k) = c. Therefore, 2c = c implies c = 0. But then f(0) = 0, which violates the first condition f(0) > 0. So constant functions other than zero don't work, but zero is invalid here. So constant functions are out.\n\nNext, maybe a linear function. Let's suppose f(k) = a|k| + b, where a and b are non-negative integers. Then, let's check the condition. For a given k, we need to compute the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) over all l. Let's substitute:\n\nf(k - l) + f(l) = a|k - l| + b + a|l| + b = a(|k - l| + |l|) + 2b.\n\nWe need the minimal value of this expression over all integers l. Let's analyze |k - l| + |l|. For fixed k, this is the sum of distances from l to k and from l to 0. The minimal value of |k - l| + |l| occurs when l is between 0 and k (if k is positive) or between k and 0 (if k is negative). Wait, actually, for any real number l, |k - l| + |l| is minimized when l is between 0 and k if k is positive, and between k and 0 if k is negative. But since l is an integer, the minimal value would be |k|. Wait, let me check.\n\nSuppose k is positive. Let's take l = 0: |k - 0| + |0| = k + 0 = k. If l = k: |k - k| + |k| = 0 + k = k. If l is between 0 and k, say l = m where 0 ≤ m ≤ k, then |k - m| + |m| = (k - m) + m = k. Similarly, if l is negative, then |k - l| + |l| = k - l + (-l) = k - 2l, which is greater than k since l is negative. So the minimal value is indeed k. Therefore, the minimal value of |k - l| + |l| is |k|. Therefore, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) is a|k| + 2b. According to the condition, this should equal f(k) = a|k| + b. Therefore, a|k| + 2b = a|k| + b ⇒ 2b = b ⇒ b = 0. But then f(k) = a|k|. But then f(0) = a*0 = 0, which again violates the first condition. So linear functions of the form a|k| + b with b ≠ 0 don't work, and if b = 0, f(0) = 0 which is invalid. So linear functions also don't work.\n\nHmm, maybe a different kind of function. What if f is periodic? Let's consider f(k) = 0 except at k = 0, but f(0) > 0. Wait, but then for k ≠ 0, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) would have to be f(k). But if f(k) is 0 for k ≠ 0, then for any l, f(k - l) + f(l) would be 0 + 0 = 0 unless l or k - l is 0. But if k ≠ 0, then either l = k or l = 0. If l = k, then f(k - l) + f(l) = f(0) + f(k) = f(0) + 0 = f(0). If l = 0, then f(k - 0) + f(0) = f(k) + f(0) = 0 + f(0) = f(0). So the minimal value is f(0), but according to the condition, this should be equal to f(k). But f(k) = 0 for k ≠ 0, so f(0) must equal 0, which contradicts the first condition. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(k) is non-zero only at certain points. Let's consider f(k) = 1 for all k. But then, as before, f(k - l) + f(l) = 1 + 1 = 2 for any l, so the minimal value is 2, which should equal f(k) = 1. Not possible.\n\nWait, maybe f(k) is a function that's 0 except at 0, but f(0) is some positive integer. Let's say f(0) = c > 0, and f(k) = 0 for k ≠ 0. Then, for any k ≠ 0, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l). If k ≠ 0, then in order for f(k - l) + f(l) to be non-zero, either l = 0 or l = k. If l = 0, then f(k) + f(0) = 0 + c = c. If l = k, then f(0) + f(k) = c + 0 = c. So the minimal value is c, which should equal f(k) = 0. But c > 0, so this is impossible. Therefore, such a function doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(k) is non-zero only at k = 0 and k = 1, but let's see. Wait, perhaps a function that's 0 except at 0 and 1. But this might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(k) is a function that satisfies f(k) = min_{l} [f(k - l) + f(l)]. This looks similar to the definition of a function built recursively via some minimization principle. Wait, but in this case, it's over all integers l. So for each k, f(k) is the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) over all l. So this is similar to the definition of a function where each value is the sum of two other values, minimized over certain choices.\n\nThis reminds me of the concept of a function satisfying a recursive relation, but here it's not a recurrence relation over natural numbers, but over all integers. So perhaps we need to define f(k) in such a way that the minimal sum f(k - l) + f(l) is f(k). Let's try to consider small k first.\n\nLet's start with k = 0. The condition is f(0) > 0. Then, for k = 0, the minimal value over all l of f(0 - l) + f(l) = f(-l) + f(l) must equal f(0). So f(0) is the minimal value of f(-l) + f(l) over all l. Since l can be any integer, this is the same as the minimal value of f(l) + f(-l) over all l. Therefore, f(0) is the minimal value of f(l) + f(-l).\n\nBut f(0) is supposed to be greater than 0. Let's see. For l = 0, f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0). So 2f(0) is one of the terms. But since we're taking the minimal value, unless 2f(0) is the minimal, f(0) must be less than or equal to 2f(0), which is always true. Wait, but the minimal value is f(0), so the minimal of f(l) + f(-l) over l must be f(0). Therefore, there exists some l such that f(l) + f(-l) = f(0). But also, for all other l, f(l) + f(-l) ≥ f(0).\n\nLet me note that. So f(0) is the minimal value of f(l) + f(-l). So there exists some l where equality holds. Let's suppose l = 0: f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0). So if this is the minimal, then f(0) ≤ 2f(0), which is always true, but equality would require f(0) = 2f(0), which implies f(0) = 0, contradicting f(0) > 0. Therefore, the minimal must be achieved at some l ≠ 0. So there exists some non-zero l where f(l) + f(-l) = f(0). Let's take such an l.\n\nSuppose l = 1. Then f(1) + f(-1) = f(0). Similarly, for l = -1, same thing. What if l = 2? Then f(2) + f(-2) ≥ f(0). But maybe f(2) + f(-2) is larger than f(0). So the minimal is achieved at l = 1 or l = -1.\n\nBut let's try to assume that f(1) + f(-1) = f(0). Let me denote f(0) = c > 0. Then f(1) + f(-1) = c. Similarly, for k = 1, the minimal value of f(1 - l) + f(l) over all l must equal f(1). Similarly for k = -1.\n\nLet me try to write down the conditions for k = 1. For k = 1, the minimal value of f(1 - l) + f(l) over l ∈ Z must be equal to f(1). Let's compute this. For each integer l, f(1 - l) + f(l). To find the minimum.\n\nLet's consider different values of l:\n\n- If l = 0: f(1 - 0) + f(0) = f(1) + c\n- If l = 1: f(1 - 1) + f(1) = f(0) + f(1) = c + f(1)\n- If l = 2: f(1 - 2) + f(2) = f(-1) + f(2)\n- If l = -1: f(1 - (-1)) + f(-1) = f(2) + f(-1)\n- Similarly, for other l.\n\nSo the minimal value must be f(1). Let's see what possible values l can take to get a smaller sum.\n\nWait, if we set l such that 1 - l is some other value. Let's suppose l = m. Then f(1 - m) + f(m). To minimize this. Let's think about possible m.\n\nIf m = 0: f(1) + c\n\nIf m = 1: c + f(1)\n\nIf m = 2: f(-1) + f(2)\n\nIf m = -1: f(2) + f(-1)\n\nIf m = 3: f(-2) + f(3)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut unless f(-1) + f(2) or f(2) + f(-1) is less than f(1), the minimal could be achieved there. But since f(1) + c and c + f(1) are both equal to f(1) + c. So if c > 0, then f(1) + c is larger than f(1), unless c is zero, which it's not. Wait, but we need the minimal value over all l to be f(1). Therefore, there must exist some l where f(1 - l) + f(l) ≤ f(1). Wait, but if all l give f(1 - l) + f(l) ≥ f(1), then the minimal would be f(1). But if there exists some l where it's less, then the minimal would be less than f(1), which contradicts the condition.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the condition, for k = 1, the minimal value of f(1 - l) + f(l) must be exactly f(1). Therefore, there must be some l where f(1 - l) + f(l) = f(1), and all other l must give f(1 - l) + f(l) ≥ f(1).\n\nSo let's suppose that for l = 2, f(1 - 2) + f(2) = f(-1) + f(2) = f(1). Similarly, for l = -1, f(1 - (-1)) + f(-1) = f(2) + f(-1) = f(1). Therefore, both of these would need to equal f(1). But from earlier, we have f(1) + f(-1) = c. So f(-1) = c - f(1). Then, substituting into f(-1) + f(2) = f(1), we get (c - f(1)) + f(2) = f(1) ⇒ f(2) = 2f(1) - c.\n\nSimilarly, f(2) + f(-1) = f(1) ⇒ (2f(1) - c) + (c - f(1)) = f(1) ⇒ f(1) = f(1), which is consistent.\n\nSo we have f(2) = 2f(1) - c. Let's note this.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 2, the minimal value of f(2 - l) + f(l) must equal f(2). Let's analyze this. For l such that 2 - l is another integer. Let's pick l = 1: f(2 - 1) + f(1) = f(1) + f(1) = 2f(1). If this is equal to f(2), then 2f", "answer": "Udowodnijmy, że takiej funkcji nie ma.
