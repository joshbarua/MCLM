Determinare il massimo numero di triangoli isosceli aventi due lati buoni che possono apparire in una tale suddivisione.", "response": "To determine the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides that can appear in a triangulation of a 2006-gon \\( P \\) using 2003 diagonals, we need to analyze the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed.\n\nFirst, let's define what a good diagonal is. A diagonal is good if its endpoints divide the boundary of the polygon into two parts, each consisting of an odd number of sides. Since the polygon has 2006 sides, which is an even number, any diagonal that divides the polygon into two parts with an odd number of sides must connect two vertices that are an odd number of vertices apart.\n\nNext, consider the triangulation of the polygon. Each triangle in the triangulation will have three sides, and we are interested in the triangles that have two good sides. For a triangle to have two good sides, the third side must also be a good diagonal. This is because if two sides of a triangle are good diagonals, the third side must connect two vertices that are an odd number of vertices apart, which means it is also a good diagonal.\n\nNow, let's count the number of good diagonals in the polygon. The number of diagonals in a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by \\( \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\). For a 2006-gon, the total number of diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\cdot 2003}{2} = 2006 \\cdot 1001 = 2008006\n\\]\nHowever, we are only using 2003 diagonals in the triangulation. Since each good diagonal can be part of at most one triangle with two good sides (because no two diagonals intersect in the interior of the polygon), the maximum number of such triangles is equal to the number of good diagonals used in the triangulation.\n\nTo find the maximum number of good diagonals that can be used in the triangulation, we need to consider the structure of the triangulation. In a triangulation of an \\( n \\)-gon, there are \\( n-2 \\) triangles. For a 2006-gon, there are \\( 2006-2 = 2004 \\) triangles. Since each triangle has three sides and each diagonal is shared by two triangles, the total number of sides in the triangulation is:\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 2004 = 6012\n\\]\nThe total number of sides in the triangulation includes the 2006 sides of the original polygon and the 2003 diagonals. Therefore, the total number of sides is:\n\\[\n2006 + 2003 = 4009\n\\]\nSince each diagonal is counted twice in the total number of sides, the number of diagonals used in the triangulation is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6012 - 4009}{2} = \\frac{2003}{2} = 1001\n\\]\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes each diagonal is counted twice, but some diagonals are counted only once. Instead, we need to consider the structure of the triangulation more carefully. The correct approach is to use the fact that each triangle with two good sides must have a third side that is also a good diagonal. Therefore, the maximum number of such triangles is equal to the number of good diagonals used in the triangulation, which is 1001.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides that can appear in a triangulation of a 2006-gon using 2003 diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1001}\n\\]", "answer": "1003"}

Let \\(K\\) be the incenter of triangle \\(ADC\\). We are given that \\(\\angle BEK = 45^\\circ\\). We need to determine all possible values of \\(\\angle CAB\\).\n\nFirst, let \\(\\angle CAB = 2\\alpha\\). Since \\(AB = AC\\), \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = 90^\\circ - \\alpha\\). The angle bisector of \\(\\angle CAB\\) is also the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\), so \\(\\angle BAD = \\angle CAD = \\alpha\\).

The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with side lengths \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), the following must hold:\n1. \\( x + y > z \\)\n2. \\( x + z > y \\)\n3. \\( y + z > x \\)\n\nIn our case, the side lengths are \\( a \\), \\( f(b) \\), and \\( f(b + f(a) - 1) \\).

A north-east square is a grid where each cell contains a unique integer from 1 to \\(n^2\\) and each cell is adjacent only to cells that contain larger numbers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of a valle. A valle is a cell that is adjacent only to cells that contain larger numbers. This means that a valle must be in a position where it is the smallest number in its row and column. In other words, a valle is a local minimum in the grid.\n\nFor an \\(n \\times n\\) grid, the minimum number of camtons ascending paths is equal to the number of valleys in the grid. This is because each camino ascending must start at a valle and each valle can start at most one camino ascending.\n\nTo find the minimum number of valleys in an \\(n \\times n\\) grid, we need to consider the distribution of the numbers. The smallest number, 1, must be a valle because it is the smallest number in the grid. The second smallest number, 2, can be in a position where it is not a valle if it is adjacent to a smaller number. However, the \\(n^2\\)th smallest number, \\(n^2\\), must be a valle because it is the largest number in the grid.\n\nThe minimum number of valleys in an \\(n \\times n\\) grid is \\(n\\).

By definition, \\(d\\) must divide both \\(a^n + b\\) and \\(b^n + a\\). Therefore, \\(d\\) must also divide any linear combination of these two expressions. Specifically, consider the expression:\n\\[\nd \\mid (a^n + b) - (b^n + a) = a^n - b^n + b - a.\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nd \\mid (a^n - b^n) + (b - a).\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the property of the greatest common divisor that if \\(d \\mid x\\) and \\(d \\mid y\\), then \\(d \\mid kx + ly\\) for any integers \\(k\\) and \\(l\\).
