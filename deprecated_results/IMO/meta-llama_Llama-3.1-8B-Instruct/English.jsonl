Since x, y, z ∈ {0, 1, ..., n}, there are (n + 1)^3 points in total. However, we need to exclude the point (0, 0, 0), so there are (n + 1)^3 - 1 points in S.\n\nWe can start by considering the plane x + y + z = 0. This plane passes through the origin (0, 0, 0) and divides the space into two parts. The points in S are either above or on this plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the points above the plane x + y + z = 0. We can define a new plane x + y + z = 1. This plane also passes through the origin and divides the space into two parts. The points in S are either above or on this plane.\n\nNotice that the points above the plane x + y + z = 0 and below the plane x + y + z = 1 are all in S. This is because x + y + z > 0 for all points in S, so they must be above the plane x + y + z = 0. Also, x + y + z < 1 for all points in S, so they must be below the plane x + y + z = 1.\n\nTherefore, we can cover all the points in S by two planes: x + y + z = 0 and x + y + z = 1. However, we need to exclude the point (0, 0, 0), which is on the plane x + y + z = 0. So, we can remove this plane and use only the plane x + y + z = 1.\n\nHowever, we can do even better. We can use the plane x + y = 1 and the plane y + z = 1. These two planes intersect at the point (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0), and they cover all the points in S except for the point (0, 0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of planes that can cover all the points in S but not include the point (0, 0, 0) is 2.", "answer": "3n"}

", "response": "\\boxed{The only possible functions $g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ are $g(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = x$.}\n\nTo prove this, we first note that if $g(m) = 0$ for some $m$, then $g(n) = 0$ for all $n$ since $(g(m) + n)(m + g(n))$ is a perfect square for all $n$. This is because $g(m) + n$ and $m + g(n)$ are both nonnegative, so their product is a perfect square if and only if both are perfect squares. Since $g(m) = 0$, we have $g(n) = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nNow suppose $g(m) \\neq 0$ for all $m$. We claim that $g(m) = m$ for all $m$. We prove this by induction on $m$. For the base case, we have $g(1) = 1$ since $g(1) + 1$ and $1 + g(1)$ are both perfect squares. For the inductive step, suppose $g(k) = k$ for all $k < m$. We want to show that $g(m) = m$. Since $g(m) \\neq 0$, we have $g(m) + m > m$. Let $a = g(m) + m$ and $b = m + g(m)$. Then $ab$ is a perfect square, so $a$ and $b$ are both perfect squares.

Therefore, $g(m) + m = m + 1$ and $m + g(m) = m + 1$, so $g(m) = m$. This completes the inductive step, and we have shown that $g(m) = m$ for all $m$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible functions $g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ are $g(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = x$.", "answer": "c \\geq 0, g(n) = n + c"}

This gives us $f(0)^2 + f(0) = f(0)$, which simplifies to $f(0)^2 - f(0) = 0$. This equation has two solutions: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $f(0) = 0$. We can set $y = 0$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(x) \\cdot 0) + f(x) = f(0)$. Since $f(0) = 0$, this simplifies to $f(0) + f(x) = 0$, which implies that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where $f(0) = 1$. We can set $y = 0$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(x) \\cdot 0) + f(x) = f(0)$. Since $f(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $1 + f(x) = 1$, which implies that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the case where $f(0) = 1$ and $f(x) \\neq 0$ for some $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In this case, we can set $x = 0$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(0) f(y)) + f(0 + y) = f(0 \\cdot y)$. Since $f(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $f(y) + f(y) = f(0)$, which implies that $2f(y) = 1$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $f(y) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we can set $x = 1$ and $y = -1$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(1) f(-1)) + f(1 - 1) = f(1 \\cdot (-1))$. Since $f(1) f(-1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $f(1 - 1) = f(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $f(\\frac{1}{4}) + 0 = f(-1)$. However, we also have $f(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, so this implies that $f(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can set $x = -1$ and $y = -1$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(-1) f(-1)) + f(-1 + (-1)) = f((-1) \\cdot (-1))$. Since $f(-1) f(-1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $f(-1 + (-1)) = f(-2)$, this simplifies to $f(\\frac{1}{4}) + f(-2) = f(1)$. However, we also have $f(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, so this implies that $f(-2) = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can set $x = 1$ and $y = -2$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(1) f(-2)) + f(1 - 2) = f(1 \\cdot (-2))$. Since $f(1) f(-2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})$ and $f(1 - 2) = f(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, this simplifies to $f(\\frac{1}{2} (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})) + \\frac{1}{2} = f(-2)$. However, we also have $f(-2) = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$, so this implies that $f(\\frac{1}{2} (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})) = f(1) - 1$.\n\nNow, we can set $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(1) f(1)) + f(1 + 1) = f(1 \\cdot 1)$. Since $f(1) f(1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $f(1 + 1) = f(2)$, this simplifies to $f(\\frac{1}{4}) + f(2) = f(1)$.

Since $f(2) f(-2) = (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})$ and $f(2 - 2) = f(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $f((f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})^2) + 1 = f(-4)$. However, we also have $f(-4) = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$, so this implies that $f((f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})^2) = f(1) - \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can set $x = 1$ and $y = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$ in the given functional equation to get $f(f(1) f(f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})) + f(1 + (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})) = f(1 \\cdot (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}))$.

However, we also have $f(\\frac{1}{2} (f(1) - \\frac{1}{2})) = f(1) - 1$ and $f(f(1) - \\frac{1}{4}) = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$, so this implies that $f(1) - 1 + f(1) - \\frac{1}{2} = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $f(0) = 1$ and $f(x) \\neq 0$ for some $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only functions that satisfy the given functional equation are $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.", "answer": "f(x)=0, f(x)=x-1, f(x)=1-x"}
