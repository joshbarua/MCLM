Since \\( P \\) is a regular 2006-gon, it has 2006 vertices. The sides of \\( P \\) are also considered good.\n\n### Step 1: Count the number of good diagonals\n\nA diagonal connecting vertices \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\) is good if the number of vertices between \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\) (not including \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\)) is odd. For a regular 2006-gon, the number of vertices between \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\) is \\( |i-j|-1 \\).\n\nThe number of vertices between \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\) is odd if and only if \\( |i-j| \\) is even. Since \\( P \\) has 2006 vertices, \\( |i-j| \\) can take values from 1 to 2005. The even values in this range are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2004. There are 1002 even numbers in this range.\n\nThus, for each vertex \\( A_i \\), there are 1002 good diagonals. Since there are 2006 vertices, the total number of good diagonals is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\times 1002}{2} = 1003 \\times 1002\n\\]\n\nThis is because each diagonal is counted twice, once from each endpoint.\n\n### Step 2: Dissect the polygon into triangles\n\nThe polygon is dissected into triangles using 2003 diagonals. A regular \\( n \\)-gon can be divided into \\( n-2 \\) triangles using \\( n-3 \\) diagonals. For \\( n = 2006 \\), this means:\n\n\\[\n2006 - 2 = 2004 \\text{ triangles}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of isosceles triangles with two good sides\n\nAn isosceles triangle with two good sides can be formed if two of its sides are either both good diagonals or one is a side of the polygon and the other is a good diagonal.\n\nTo maximize the number of such triangles, consider the following:\n\n- Each side of the polygon is good.\n- Each good diagonal can potentially form an isosceles triangle with two sides being good.\n\nSince there are 2006 sides and 1003 good diagonals, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides is limited by the number of good diagonals, as each diagonal can be part of at most one isosceles triangle with two good sides.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1003}\n\\]","answer":"1003"}

A well-known result in computational geometry is that if we have two sets of points in general position (no three collinear), we can separate them using a number of lines that is at most the number of points in the smaller set. This is because each line can be used to separate at least one point from the rest, and we can iteratively apply this process.\n\nIn our case, we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points. The smaller set has 2013 points. Therefore, we can separate the red points from the blue points using at most 2013 lines.\n\nTo see why 2013 lines are sufficient, consider the following approach:\n- Start with the convex hull of the red points. If the blue points are outside this convex hull, we can separate them with lines along the edges of the hull.\n- If some blue points are inside the convex hull, we can iteratively draw lines to separate one blue point at a time from the red points, ensuring that no line passes through any point.\n\nSince the red points are fewer, we can always find a way to separate them from the blue points using at most 2013 lines, as each line can be used to separate at least one point from the rest.\n\nThus, the least value of \\( k \\) such that for any Colombian configuration of 4027 points, there is a good arrangement of \\( k \\) lines is \\(\\boxed{2013}\\).","answer":"2013"}

A valley is a cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers. This means that a valley is a local minimum in the grid.\n\nNext, we need to consider the conditions for an uphill path:\n1. It starts at a valley.\n2. It consists of cells with strictly increasing numbers.\n3. Each cell in the path is adjacent to the previous one.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the total number of such paths.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Valleys**: The number of valleys is crucial because each valley can start at least one uphill path. The fewer valleys there are, the fewer uphill paths can start.\n\n2. **Configuration**: To minimize the number of valleys, we should aim to have as few local minima as possible. A natural way to achieve this is to fill the grid in a way that minimizes the number of cells that are lower than all their neighbors.\n\n3. **Filling Strategy**: Consider filling the grid in a snake-like pattern, where numbers increase as you move along the rows, and alternate direction in each row. For example, for \\( n = 3 \\), the grid would look like this:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{ccc}\n   1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n   6 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n   7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   In this configuration, the only valley is the cell containing 1. This is because every other cell has at least one neighbor with a smaller number.\n\n4. **Generalization**: For any \\( n \\), filling the grid in a snake-like pattern ensures that the smallest number (1) is the only valley. This is because each number \\( k \\) (except 1) will have a neighbor with a smaller number, either in the same row or the previous row.\n\n5. **Uphill Paths**: Since there is only one valley (the cell with the number 1), the only uphill path starts at this cell and can potentially visit every cell in the grid in increasing order. However, each cell can only be visited once in a single path, so there is exactly one uphill path starting from the valley.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square is 1, regardless of the size \\( n \\) of the grid. This is achieved by filling the grid in a snake-like pattern, ensuring that there is only one valley.\n\nThus, the function for the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]","answer":"2n^2-2n+1"}

For large \\( n \\), the behavior of this expression is influenced by the relative sizes of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). \n\n### Case 1: \\( a = b \\)\n\nIf \\( a = b \\), then the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^n + a, a^n + a) = \\gcd(2a^n + a, 2a^n + a) = 2a^n + a\n\\]\n\nFor this to be a constant \\( g \\) for all \\( n > N \\), it must be that \\( g = a \\) and \\( a = 1 \\).

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to simplify the gcd:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = \\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a - (b^n + b))\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^n + b, a - b)\n\\]\n\nFor this gcd to be a constant \\( g \\) for all \\( n > N \\), it must be that \\( a - b \\mid a^n + b \\) for all \\( n > N \\). This implies:\n\n\\[\na^n \\equiv -b \\pmod{a-b}\n\\]\n\nFor large \\( n \\), this congruence must hold, which implies that \\( a \\equiv b \\pmod{a-b} \\).
