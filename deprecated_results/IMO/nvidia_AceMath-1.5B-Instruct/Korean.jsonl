A 2006-sided polygon has \\( \\binom{2006}{2} = 2006 \\times 1003 \\) diagonals in total. However, only 2003 diagonals are used to divide the polygon into triangles, which means the polygon is divided into \\( 2006 - 2 = 2004 \\) triangles.\n\nAn isosceles right triangle with both legs as odd diagonals must have its right angle at a vertex of the polygon and its legs as diagonals that are not sides of the polygon. Since each side of the polygon is also a diagonal, the legs of such a triangle must be diagonals that are not sides of the polygon.\n\nNow, let's consider the vertices of the polygon. Each vertex of the polygon can be the right angle of an isosceles right triangle with both legs as odd diagonals. Since there are 2006 vertices, there can be up to 2006 such triangles.\n\nHowever, we need to check if it is possible to have 2006 such triangles. Each triangle has two legs, and each leg is a diagonal. Since there are 2003 diagonals, it is not possible to have 2006 such triangles because each diagonal can only be a leg of at most one triangle.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of isosceles right triangles with both legs as odd diagonals is the number of diagonals that can be used as legs, which is 2003.\n\nThus, the maximum number of such triangles is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

Each line does not pass through any of the 4027 points.\n2. Each region formed by the lines does not contain both a red point and a blue point.\n\nA key insight here is that if we can separate the red points from the blue points using a certain number of lines, then any configuration of points will have a good arrangement. The maximum number of red points is 2013, so we need at least 2013 lines to separate each red point from the blue points.

This ensures that each region formed by these lines will contain only red points or only blue points.\n\nTo see why 2013 lines are necessary, consider the worst-case scenario where the red points are all on one side of a line and the blue points are all on the other side. In this case, any line that passes through the plane will either pass through one of the red points or one of the blue points, which violates the first condition.

A \\emph{Nordic square} is an \\( n \\times n \\) board containing all the integers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( n^2 \\) so that each cell contains exactly one number. Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers is called a \\emph{valley}. An \\emph{uphill path} is a sequence of one or more cells such that:\n\\begin{itemize} \n    \\item \\(\\) the first cell in the sequence is a valley,\n    \\item \\(\\) each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and\n    \\item \\(\\) the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.\n\\end{itemize}\nFind, as a function of \\( n \\), the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square.", "question": "\\(n\\) 양의 정수 \\(n\\) 에 대하여, 복구형 스퀘어란 \\(n \\times n\\) 칸으로 이루어진 정사각형 보드로서 \\(\\)\\(1\\) 부터 \\(n^2\\) 까지의 각 정수가 각 칸에 정확히 하나씩 씌어져 있다. 서로 다른 두 칸이 인접한다는 말은 이 칸들이 하나의 변을 공유한다는 말이다. 어느 칸 안의 숫자가 그 칸에 인집한 모든 칸들의 숫자보다 더 작을 때 그 칸을 계곡이라고 부르라. 오르막길이란 난들로 이루어진 수열로서 다음 조건을 모두 만족한다.\\((i)\\) 수열의 첫번째 칸은 계곡이다.\\((ii)\\) 수열 안의 연속한 두 칸은 인접한다.\\((iii)\\) 수열의 칸에 씌어져 있는 숫자들은 증가한다.한 반복형 스퀘어 안에 있는 오르막길의 총 개수의 가능한 가장 작은 값을 \\(n\\) 의 식으로 나타내어라.", "response": "To determine the smallest possible number of distinct longest arithmetic sequences (OARCS) in an \\(n \\times n\\) complex square grid where each number from 1 to \\(n^2\\) appears exactly once, and the sequences satisfy the given conditions, we need to analyze the structure and properties of such sequences.\n\nFirst, let's define the conditions more clearly:\n1. The first number in the sequence is a boundary number (i.e., it is in the first row or the first column).\n2. Any two consecutive numbers in the sequence are adjacent (i.e., they share a side).\n3. The numbers in the sequence are strictly increasing.\n\nThe longest possible sequence in an \\(n \\times n\\) grid is \\(n\\) numbers, which would form a path from the boundary to the opposite boundary. However, the number of such sequences depends on the arrangement of the numbers.\n\nTo find the minimum number of OARCS, consider the following arrangement:\n- Place the number 1 in the top-left corner.\n- Place the number 2 in the cell to the right of 1.\n- Continue placing the numbers in a row-wise manner until the last row.\n- Place the number \\(n^2\\) in the bottom-right corner.\n\nIn this arrangement, the longest OARCS will be along the top row or the leftmost column, each of which has \\(n\\) numbers. However, there are other possible OARCS that can be formed by starting at different boundary numbers and following the adjacent cells.\n\nTo count the minimum number of OARCS, we need to consider the different starting points and the paths they can form. The key insight is that the number of OARCS is minimized when the grid is filled in a way that maximizes the overlap of the paths.\n\nFor an \\(n \\times n\\) grid, the minimum number of OARCS is \\(n\\). This is because each row and each column can form a unique OARCS, and there are \\(n\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of distinct longest arithmetic sequences in an \\(n \\times n\\) complex square grid is \\(\\boxed{n}\\).", "answer": "2n^2-2n+1"}

This implies that \\( g \\) is a divisor of both \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\) for all \\( n \\geq N \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the GCD Condition\nLet's start by examining the case when \\( n = N \\):\n\\[ \\gcd(a^N + b, b^N + a) = g. \\]\nNow, consider \\( n = N+1 \\):\n\\[ \\gcd(a^{N+1} + b, b^{N+1} + a) = g. \\]\nSince \\( g \\) divides both \\( a^N + b \\) and \\( b^N + a \\), it must also divide any linear combination of these two expressions. In particular, it must divide:\n\\[ a^{N+1} + b - a(a^N + b) = a^{N+1} + b - a^{N+1} - ab = b(1 - a). \\]\nSimilarly, it must divide:\n\\[ b^{N+1} + a - b(b^N + a) = b^{N+1} + a - b^{N+1} - ab = a(1 - b). \\]\nTherefore, \\( g \\) must divide both \\( b(1 - a) \\) and \\( a(1 - b) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Possible Values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\nSince \\( g \\) divides both \\( b(1 - a) \\) and \\( a(1 - b) \\), and \\( g \\) is a positive integer, the only way this can happen is if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are either both 1 or both -1. This is because if \\( a \\neq b \\), then \\( 1 - a \\) and \\( 1 - b \\) are non-zero, and \\( g \\) would have to divide both \\( b(1 - a) \\) and \\( a(1 - b) \\), which is not possible unless \\( a = b = 1 \\) or \\( a = b = -1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Sequences\nNow, let's verify that the sequences \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) are periodic. The sequence \\( a_n \\) is defined such that each term is the number of terms in the sequence \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1} \\) that are equal to \\( a_{n-1} \\). This implies that \\( a_n \\) is a periodic sequence with period 2, i.e., \\( a_{n+2} = a_n \\).\n\nSimilarly, the sequence \\( b_n \\) is defined such that each term is the number of terms in the sequence \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{n-1} \\) that are equal to \\( b_{n-1} \\). This implies that \\( b_n \\) is a periodic sequence with period 2, i.e., \\( b_{n+2} = b_n \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, both sequences \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) are periodic.
