"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( DE \) is the hypotenuse. We are given \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \).

First, recall that the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} \).

We can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Substituting \( EF = 7 \) into the equation, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \( DE \), we can solve for \( DE \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DE \) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \( DE \) is \( \boxed{10} \).\\

"To solve for \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). Here are the steps to find \( w \):

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**

   The translation is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]
   So, the translated point is \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \).

2. **Rotate the translated point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**

    To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

   The rotation is:
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property to expand this product:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2 }
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3
   = 4 - 2i
   \]
   So, after rotation, the point is \( 4 - 2i \).

3. **Translate the rotated point back:**

   We need to translate the point \( 4 - 2i \) back by adding \( c \):
   \[
   4 - 2i + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is:
\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}
\]```python

"To find the square root of 242, we start by factoring the number into its prime factors. The number 242 can be factored as follows:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can arrange 8 people in a circle such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) are always together. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Treat the 3 specific people as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must always be together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the other 5 individual people) in a circle.

2. **Arrange the 6 units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). So, the number of ways to arrange 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the 3 people within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) ways.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units in a circle by the number of ways to arrange the 3 people  within their block. This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are always together is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term). Let's determine the power of \(x\) in the general term \(T_k\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k }
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \left(-1\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the power of \(x\) in \(T_k\) is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

For \(T_k\) to be a constant term, the power of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part :

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = (-1)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right)
\]
\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot -\frac{100}{8}
\]
\[
T_3 = -\frac{1000}{8}

"(vars center of rotation is at the origin (0,0).

The point that needs to rotate by the smallest angle to overlap with its original position is the point that is closest to the origin. This point is the one with the smallest distance from the origin.

The distance of a point (x, y) from the origin is given by the formula:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

We calculate the distances for each point:
\[
\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}

\[

\]
\[
\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

The smallest distance is \(\sqrt{2}\), which corresponds to the point (1, 1).

To find the angle of rotation, we need to determine the angle that the line from the origin to the point (1, 1 ) makes with the positive x-axis. This angle is given by:
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

For the point (1, 1):
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \tan^{-1}(1) = 45^\circ
\]

Therefore, the smallest angle by which the point (1, 1) must be rotated to overlap with its original position is \(\boxed{45}\) degrees.```

"给定的平行四边形的顶点是 \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), 和 \((x, y)\) 且 \(x > 7\)。我们需要找到 \(x + y\) 的值。

首先，我们使用平行四边形的性质，即对角线互相平分。因此，对角线的中点相同。我们可以选择 \((5, 3)\) 和 \((x, y)\) 作为一条对角线，\((6, 8)\) 和 \((7, 4)\) 作为另一条对角线。

计算 \((6, 8)\) 和 \((7, 4)\) 的中点：
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right) = (6.5, 6)
\]

由于对角线互相平分，\((5, 3)\) 和 \((x, y)\) 的中点也必须是 \((6.5, 6)\ )。设 \((5, 3)\) 和 \((x, y)\) 的中点为 \((m, n)\)，则：

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

"要找到函数 \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) 的 asymptotes 的值，我们需要确定垂直和水平渐近线，然后将这些值相加。

首先，让我们找到垂直渐近线。垂直渐近线出现在分母为零的地方，因为函数在这些点上是未定义的。因此，我们需要解方程：
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
我们可以将这个二次方程因式分解如下：
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
将每个因子设置为零，我们得到根：
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{或} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
这给出我们：
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{或} \quad x = -2. \]
因此，垂直渐近线是 \( x = 7 \) 和 \( x = -2 \)。所以，\( a = 7 \) 和 \( b = -2 \)。

接下来，让我们找到水平渐近线。 水平渐近线由函数在 \( x \) 接近无穷大时的行为决定。对于有理函数 \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \)，其中 \( P(x) \) 和 \( Q(x) \) 分别是分子和分母的多项式，如果 \( P(x) \) 和 \( Q(x) \) 的次数不同，那么水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。然而，如果 \( P(x) \) 和 \( Q(x) \) 的次数相同，那么水平渐近线是 \( y = \frac{\text{最高次项系数 of } P(x)}{\text{最高次项系数 of } Q(x)} \)。

在我们的情况下，分子的次数是1，分母的次数是2。由于次数不同，水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。因此，\( c = 0 \)。

最后，我们需要找到 \( a + b + c \) 的和：

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) for all \(\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}\). This is equivalent to the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\ ]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
 \[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4, and the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|\) for all \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\) is \( C = 4 \).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). This implies that

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes

   - The next power of 9 is \(1\).
   - Divide the remainder by 1:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine these two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second term with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
 \]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"Let's denote the weight of one squig as \( S \) and the weight of one goolee as \( G \). According to the problem, Tio trees both a squig and a goolee together, and the total weight of these two items is equal to the weight of one squig. This can be written as:

\[ S + G = S \]

To find the weight of one goolee, we can subtract \( S \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ G = S - S \]
\[ G = 0 \]

This means that the weight of one goolee is 0. Now, let's consider the total weight of three squigs and one goolee. Since the weight of one goolee is 0, the total weight of three squigs and one goolee is simply the weight of three squigs:

\[ 3S + G = 3S + 0 = 3S \]

According to the problem, the total weight of three squigs and one goolee is equal to the weight of one squig. Therefore, we have:

\[ 3S = S \]

This equation is not possible unless the weight of one squig is 0 , which contradicts the problem statement that Tio trees both a squig and a goolee. However, the problem is asking for the relationship between the total weight of three squigs and one goolee and the weight of one squig, which we have shown is simply three times the weight of one squig, but since the weight of one squig is the same as the total weight of three squigs and one goolee, the answer is:

首先，让我们写出两个多项式的乘积：

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

我们将通过分配律展开这个乘积：

\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

\[

合并同类项，我们得到：

\[

\]

我们知道这个表达式等于 $12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6$。因此，我们可以将相应项的系数相等：

1. $t^4$ 的系数是 $12$，这已经匹配。
2. $t^3$ 的系数给出 $3b + 20 = 26$。解 $b$：

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

3. $t^2$ 的系数给出 $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$。将 $b = 2$ 代入：

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

 4. $t$ 的系数给出 $-10 + ab = -16$。将 $a = -3$ 和 $b = 2$ 代入：

\[

这确认了我们的 $a$ 和 $b$ 的值。常数项给出 $-2a = 6$。将 $a = -3$ 代入：

"To determine the radius of the tank, we start by using the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled with water. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. This is the volume of water added per unit time.

The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the height \(h\) of the cylinder is the height of the water in the tank, which is changing over time, but the rate at which the volume is changing is constant at \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. This rate of change of volume is also known as the derivative of the volume with respect to time, \(\frac{dV}{dt}\).

Since the tank is being filled at a constant rate, we can express the rate of change of volume as:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]
where \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is the rate at which the height of the water is  changing with respect to time. However, since the problem does not provide the rate at which the height is changing, we can infer that the rate of change of volume is simply the volume added per hour divided by the height of the water, which simplifies to the constant rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour.

Given that the rate of change of volume is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ \pi r^2 = 20\pi \]
We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:
\[ r^2 = 20 \]
To find the radius \(r\), we take the square root of both sides:
\[ r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]
Thus, the radius of the tank is:

"为了确定使得函数 $f(x)$ 的图象至少与一条水平线相交一次的 $a$ 的值，我们需要分析函数在两种情况下的行为：$x \geq a$ 和 $x < a$。

函数定义为：
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{om } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{om } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

首先，让我们考虑 $x \geq a$ 情况下的函数，即 $f(x) = ax^2$。这个二次函数的最小值发生在 $x = a$（因为抛物线开口向上，对于 $x \geq a$，在 $x = a$ 处有最小值）。在 $x = a$ 处的值为：
\[
f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

接下来，考虑 $x < a$ 情况下的函数，即 $f(x) = ax + 2a$。这是一个以 $a$ 为斜率，y轴截距为 $2a$ 的线性函数。 当 $x$ 接近 $a$ 从左边时，函数值为：
\[
f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

为了使函数的图象至少与一条水平线相交一次，线性部分 $ax + 2a$ 的最大值必须大于或等于二次部分 $ax^2$ 在 $x = a$ 处的最小值。这给出了不等式：
\[
a^2 + 2a \geq a^3.
\]

重新排列不等式，我们得到：
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
\]
提取 $a$，我们有：
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.
\]
对二次表达式进行因式分解，我们得到：
\[
a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0.
\]

为了解这个不等式，我们需要确定表达式 $a(a-2)(a+1)$ 在哪些 $a$ 的值下是非正的。关键点是 $a = 0$，$a =  2$，和 $a = -1$。我们可以在由这些点确定的区间中测试表达式的符号：$(-\infty, -1)$，$(-1, 0)$，$(0, 2)$，和 $(2, \infty)$。

- 对于 $a \in (-\infty, -1)$，选择 $a = -2$，我们得到 $(-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 < 0$。
- 对于 $a \in (-1, 0)$，选择 $a = -0.5$，我们得到 $(-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0$。
- 对于 $a \in (0, 2)$，选择 $a = 1$，我们得到 $(1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0$。
- 对于 $a \in (2, \infty)$ ，选择 $a = 3$，我们得到 $(3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0$。

因此，不等式 $a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0$ 在 $a \in [-1, 0] \cup [0, 2] = [-1, 2]$ 时成立。

然而，由于 $a$ 是正数，我们排除 $a = 0$，留下区间 $0 < a \leq 2$。

因此，满足条件的 $a$ 的值是：
\[

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \( (h, k) \) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \) terms:
 \[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed square terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation of the circle in standard form is:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

 We know that the radius of the circle is 1, so we set the right side of the equation equal to \(1^2 = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) - x = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0. \]
So, \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda(1 - x) = 1\), which gives \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1\),  which is equivalent to \(1 \leq \lambda \leq \infty\). Since \(\lambda\) is bounded by 4, we have \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's denote \(y = f(x)\), so \(f(y) = x\). This means that \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) and \(x = \lambda y(1 - y)\). Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[ x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
This is a complicated equation, so let's simplify it step by step. First, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). This means that \(x\) and \(f(x)\) are periodic points of period 2.

To find these values, we need to solve the equation:
\[ f (f(x)) = x. \]
This gives us:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Let's denote \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\), so we have:
\[ \lambda z(1 - z) = x. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \(z\):
\[ \lambda z - \lambda z^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda z^2 - \lambda z + x = 0. \]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[ z = \frac{\lambda \pm \sqrt{\lambda^2 - 4\lambda x}}{2\lambda}. \]
For \(z\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[ 0 \leq \frac{\lambda - \sqrt{\lambda^2 - 4\lambda x}}{2\lambda} \leq 1, \]
\[ 0 \leq \frac{\lambda + \sqrt{\lambda^2 - 4\lambda x}}{2\lambda} \leq 1. \]
Additionally, we need \(f(x) \neq x \), so:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) \neq x, \]
\[ x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) \neq 0. \]
This means that \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

After analyzing the conditions, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda \in (1, 4)\).

\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)\), we can rewrite the terms involving cosines and sines:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\ [
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms involving sines and cosines:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)\),  we can rewrite the terms:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) again, we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
 Since \(\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ\) and \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ - \sin 25^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 25^\circ} = -1.

The number of trailing zeros will be determined by the limiting factor, which is the number of times 5 appears as a factor, because there are usually more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials.

We use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:

We need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) =  2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

We now evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 }} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -1. \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Therefore, the maximum  value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\). \]```

"为了找到顶点在 $O = (0,0,0)$，$A = (1,2,3)$ 和 $B = (-3,-2,1)$ 的三角形 $OAB$ 的面积，我们可以使用由两个向量形成的平行四边形的面积是它们的叉积的模的性质。三角形的面积是这个值的一半。

首先，我们需要找到向量 $\overrightarrow{OA}$ 和 $\overrightarrow{OB}$ 的叉积：
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]
展开这个行列式，我们得到：
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2)  - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
因此，叉积是：
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
叉积的模是：
\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
三角形 $OAB$ 的面积是这个模的一半：
\[
\text{面积} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
 \]
因此，三角形 $OAB$ 的面积是：

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane, since \( z \cdot \frac{1}{z} = 1 \). This means \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) can be rewritten using Euler's formula as:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

which simplifies to:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

We know that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) corresponds to a specific angle \( \theta \). However, we don't need to find the exact angle \( \theta \) to solve the problem. Instead, we use the fact that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic  equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5 - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} \ ]

But we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity shifted by a factor, and the powers of \( z \) will cycle every 5. Therefore, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( z^{85} = (z^5)^{17} = 1^{17} = 1 \). Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

So the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of triangle \( \triangle مصدر \) in relation to the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \). We start by noting some key properties of the triangle and the medians.

1. The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid \( G \), which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

3. The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (or Thales' theorem).

4. The ratio of the sides  of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is the same as the ratio of the altitudes from \( A \) to \( MN \) and from \( A \) to \( BC \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \) and \( G \) is the midpoint of the median from \( A \), the altitude from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

5. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

6. Since the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64  \).

7. Now, we need to find the area of \( \triangle AGW \). Since \( W \) is the midpoint of \( MN \) (because \( G \) is the centroid and divides the median in a 2:1 ratio), \( W \) divides \( MN \) into two equal parts. Therefore, \( \triangle AGW \) is half of \( \triangle AMN \).

8. Thus, the area of \( \triangle AGW \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 64 = 32 \).

Therefore, the area of triangle \( \triangle AGW \) is \( \boxed{32} \).```

Solve the problem by finding the sum of all such integers $n$ greater than 1.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = n^k \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( n \) must be a power of 2, because the only prime factor of \( 2^{24} \) is 2. Therefore, we can write \( n \) as \( 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Then we have:

\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^k = 2^{mk} \]

This implies that \( mk = 24 \). We need to find all pairs \((m, k)\) such that \( mk = 24 \) and then determine the corresponding values of \( n = 2^m \). The factor pairs \((m, k)\) of 24 are:

\[
(1,  24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 3), (12, 2), (24, 1)
\]

From these pairs, we can determine the corresponding values of \( n \):

\[
n = 2^1 = 2, \quad n = 2^2 = 4, \quad n = 2^3 = 8, \quad n = 2^4 = 16, \quad n = 2^6 = 64, \quad n = 2^8 = 256, \quad n = 2^{12} = 4096, \quad n = 2^{24} = 16777216
\]

However, since \( n > 1 \), we exclude \( n = 2^0 = 1 \). The valid values of \( n \) are:

\[ 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 256, 4096, 16777216 \]

 To find the sum of these values, we calculate:

\[
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 4096 + 16777216 = 16781554
\]

Thus, the sum of all such integers \( n \) greater than 1 is:

"To determine how many nickels have landed, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know the following:
1. Each dime is worth 10 cents.
2. Each nickel is worth 5 cents.
3. The total value of the dimes and nickels is 75 cents.

We can write the equation for the total value as:
\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \]

To simplify this equation, we can divide every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

We need to find the number of nickels, \( n \). To do this, we can express \( n \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ n = 15 - 2d \]

Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( d \) must be an integer such that \( 15 - 2d \geq 0 \). This means:
\[ 15 \geq 2d \]
\[ \frac{15}{2} \ geq d \]
\[ 7.5 \geq d \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number, the possible values for \( d \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We can substitute these values into the equation \( n = 15 - 2d \) to find the corresponding values of \( n \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(0) = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(1) = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(2) = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(3) = 9 \).

- If \( d = 5 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(5) = 5 \).
 - If \( d = 6 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(6) = 3 \).
- If \( d = 7 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(7) = 1 \).

Therefore, the number of nickels can be any of the following: 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. However, without additional information, we can't determine a unique value for \( n \).

The number of nickels could be any of these values. But if we assume the problem is asking for a specific number of nickels without additional constraints, we can choose one of these values. For the sake of providing a single answer, let's assume the problem is asking for one possible value.

The number of nickels could be \boxed{15} (if there are no dimes). If there are dimes, the number of nickels could be any of the other values listed. However, based on the problem as stated, the most straightforward answer is \boxed{15}. If the problem is asking for a general solution, the answer could be any of the values listed above.","[15, '15']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine the probability that the sum of two prime numbers is even, we first need to understand the properties of prime numbers and their sums.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The smallest prime number is 2, and it is the only even prime number. All other prime numbers are odd.

Let's consider the possible sums of two prime numbers:
1. If both prime numbers are odd, their sum will be even. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is even.
2. If one prime number is even (which is 2) and the other is odd, their sum will be odd. This is because the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.

Now, let's count the number of prime numbers less than 10 (since the problem does not specify the range, we can assume a reasonable range for the prime numbers):
The prime numbers less than 10 are: 2, 3, 5, 7.

There is 1 even prime number (2) and 3 odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7).

The total number of ways to choose 2 prime numbers from these 4 prime numbers  is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \).

The number of favorable outcomes (where the sum is even) is the number of ways to choose 2 odd prime numbers from the 3 odd prime numbers, which is \( \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 \).

Therefore, the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}. \]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the two prime numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```

"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \). Since \( a \) is the \( x \)-coordinate and \( b \) is the \( y \)-coordinate, we can rewrite the equation as \( 3(4) + 2b = 12 \).

2. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 2b = 12 \implies 12 + 2b = 12.
   \]

3. Isolate the term involving \( b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   12 + 2b - 12 = 12 - 12 \implies 2b = 0.
   \]

4. Solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

"To find the total area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the areas of the two shaded triangles and then sum them up.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units. The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

### Area of the Second Triangle
The base of the second triangle  is the horizontal distance from \((3, 4)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 4 units (since the base is along the same horizontal line as the base of the first triangle but extended to the right by 1 unit). The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units. The area \(A_2\) of the second triangle is:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]

### Total Area
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 6 = 10

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we start by simplifying the fraction.

First, we express the denominator in terms of its prime factors:

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot 10^{-7} = 0.0000021605.\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(0.0000021605\). Now, we sum the digits in this decimal representation:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can rearrange and group the terms:

\ [
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)

This simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We now need to find \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2\). Using the identity for the product  of sines, we know that:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Thus,

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we will use properties of polynomials and transformations.

First, let's analyze the function \( f(x) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015
\]
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( f(x) = 0 \) (let's call them \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \)) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) with a sign change:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49
\]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). To find the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to solve \( g(x) = 0 \), which translates to:
\[
f(x + 5) = 0 
\]

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then \( g(x) = f(y) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( y = r_1, r_2, r_3 \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[
x = r_1 - 5, \quad x = r_2 - 5, \quad x = r_3 - 5
\]

The sum of these roots is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5)
\]

Using the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \), which is \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \), we substitute:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34

"To solve the given expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1.
\]

We will use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of sine and cosine functions. Specifically, we use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta + \csc^2 \theta.
\]

However, this identity alone is not directly useful here. Instead, we will use another approach involving angle sum and double angle identities.

Consider the angle sum identities:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta,
\]
\[
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta.
 \]

We will use these identities to express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\).

First, let's find \(\sin 20^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\):
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \sin(2 \times 10^\circ) = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we find \(\sin^2 20^\circ\):
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

Thus, the reciprocal of \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2  10^\circ}.
\]

Now, let's find \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\):
\[
\sin 40^\circ = \sin(2 \times 20^\circ) = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ.
\]

We already have \(\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ\). Now, find \(\cos 20^\circ\):
\[
\cos 20^\circ = \cos(2 \times 10^\circ) = \cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ.
\]

Thus,
\[
\sin 40^\circ = 2 (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ) (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ) = 4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2  10^\circ).
\]

Next, we find \(\sin^2 40^\circ\):
\[
\sin^2 40^\circ = [4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ)]^2 = 16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ)^2.
\]

Thus, the reciprocal of \(\sin^2 40^\circ\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ)^2}.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Combining all these results, we have:
 \[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ)^2}.
\]

To simplify, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ (\cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ)^2}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of the interior angles, excluding one interior angle, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   Let the measure of the excluded interior angle be \(x\). Then, the sum of the remaining interior angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]
   This equation can be rearranged to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the possible values for \(n\):**
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\ circ\). Therefore, we need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   This can be split into two inequalities:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve the first inequality:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ > 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   n-2 > \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 > 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   n > 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8 
   \]

5. **Solve the second inequality:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

6. **Combine the results from both inequalities:**
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

7. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If we exclude one interior angle, the sum  of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   1080^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle of a convex polygon, our solution is correct.

Thus, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).```

"To find the value of \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4 }}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
So, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. This means we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution, and therefore \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).  Substituting this back into our expression for \( t \), we get:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the possible values of \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since both are within the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), the solutions are:
\[ t = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = 17. \]
To verify, we check both solutions:
1. If \( t = 4 \), then \( t + 2 = 6 \) and the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23 is 6 because \( 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).
2. If \( t = 17 \), then \( t + 2 = 19 \) and the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23 is 19 because \( 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).
 Therefore, the solutions are correct. The values of \( t \) are:
\[ \boxed{4 \text{ or } 17}. \]```Python

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}

This identity can be verified by considering the complementary angles in the unit circle. The tangent function and the cotangent function are reciprocals, and their inverse functions add up to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[

2. **Determine the integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle:**
   - For \(x\)-coordinates, the integer values strictly inside the range \(-5\) to \(5\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible \(x\)-coordinates.

3. ** Calculate the total number of integer coordinate points inside the rectangle:**
   - Since each \(x\)-coordinate can pair with any of the 7 possible \(y\)-coordinates, the total number of integer coordinate points inside the rectangle is the product of the number of possible \(x\)-coordinates and the number of possible \(y\)-coordinates.

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c}  = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}

Using the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), we substitute these values into the expression:

Now we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Adding these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

"To determine the median price of the frapples sold in the 70's, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the prices for each country in the 70's.
2. List the prices in ascending order.
3. Find the middle value in the ordered list.

From the table, the prices for the 70's are:
- Brazil: 12 cent
- France: 12 cent
- Peru: 6 cent
- Spain: 13 cent

Now, let's list these prices in ascending order:
6, 12, 12, 13

Since there are 4 prices, the median will be the average of the 2nd and 3rd values in the ordered list. The 2nd and 3rd values are both 12 cent.

So, the median price is:
\[
\frac{12 + 12}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Firstly, because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid from \(A\) to \(BC\) as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b ) \times h = 84.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) from \(C\) to \(AD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). This means that \(\triangle BAC\) and \(\triangle CAD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\) and the same base \(AD\), and thus the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) because \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\) together form the trapezoid, and they have the same height.

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\boxed{21}\).","[21, '21']",28,"[28, '28']",False
"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fractions:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -19x = -9
    \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. First, calculate the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Here, we have \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators \(m\) and \(p\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now we multiply the result by 70 :

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7 \times 7 = 49
\]

Thus, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).```

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on a circle.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - For two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other. This happens if and only if the points alternate around the circle. For example, if we label the points in order as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) around the circle, the segments will intersect.

3. **Counting the Total Arrangements:**
   - The total number of ways to arrange 4 points in order around a circle is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\). This is because one point can be fixed to break the circular symmetry, and the remaining 3 points can be  arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - So, there are 6 possible ways to arrange the points \(A, B, C, D\) in order around the circle.

4. **Counting Favorable Arrangements:**
   - Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are:
     - \(A, C, B, D\)
     - \(A, D, B, C\)
   - The other 4 arrangements will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) not intersecting. These are:
     - \(A, B, C, D\)
     - \(A, B, D, C\)
     - \(A, C, D, B\)
     - \(A, D, C, B\)

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements.
   - Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

"Given two circles with centers \( D \) and radii \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) respectively, the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. We need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\).

First, let's calculate the areas of the two circles. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, so the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The area of the shaded region can also be calculated as the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let the measure of \(\angle ADC\) be \(\theta \) (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
So, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
\]
We know this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[
3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3} \implies \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]
Since \(\theta\) is in radians, we need to convert it to degrees. The conversion factor from radians to degrees is \(\frac{180 }{\pi}\), so:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{9} = 200
\]
Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]```

The final answer is \(\boxed{200}\). This problem involves understanding the areas of sectors of circles and converting between radians and degrees.

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine, as well as the identity for the product of sines.

First, let's denote:
\[ \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \]
\[ \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \]

Then the expression becomes:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) \]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know:
\[ \sin \alpha = 0.4 \]
\[ \sin \beta = 0.5 \ ]

We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2 } \]

Now substitute these into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = 0.2\sqrt{3} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = 0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21} \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - 0.2\sqrt{3} = 0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3} \]

Now we need to find the product of these two expressions:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta ) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21}\right) \cdot \left(0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) \]

This is a difference of squares:
\[ \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21}\right) \cdot \left(0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) = (0.1\sqrt{21})^2 - (0.2\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.01 \cdot 21 - 0.04 \cdot 3 = 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09 \]

"To determine the number of ways to choose 5 members from a committee of 8 republians and 6 demokrats such that at least one of the members is a repubans lie, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members and then subtracting the number of ways to choose 5 members with no repubans (i.e., all 5 are demokrats).

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members:**
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}
   \]
   Calculating the factorials:
   \[
   14! = 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!
   \]
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]
   \[
    \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{120}
   \]
   Simplifying the numerator step-by-step:
   \[
   14 \times 13 = 182
   \]
   \[
   182 \times 12 = 2184
   \]
   \[
   2184 \times 11 = 24024

   \[
   24024 \times 10 = 240240
   \]
   \[
   \frac{240240}{120} = 2002
   \]
   So, the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = 2002
    \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 demok Restrictions:**
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!}
   \]
   Calculating the factorials:
   \[
   6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
   \]
   \[
   5! = 120
   \]
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{720}{5! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{120 \times 1} = \frac{720}{120} = 6
   \]
   So, the number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 demokสนats is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one is a repubans  lie:**
   \[
   \text{Number of ways} = \binom{14}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 6 = 1996

3. **Identify a contradiction:**

   - We are given that \(a + b + c = 120\), but using the median, we calculated \(a + b + c = 72\).

 4. **Recheck the problem context:**

   - Given that the sum \(a + b + c = 120\) and the median of the numbers is 24, we need to consider that these are distinct integers.

5. **Re-evaluate the median calculation:**

   - Given that the median is 24, and the numbers are \(a, b, c\) where \(a \leq b \leq c\), we assume \(b = 24\).

6. **Substitute \(b = 24\) into the sum equation:**

   \]

7. **Solve for \(a + c\):**

   \[
   a + c = 120 - 24 = 96
   \]

8. **Determine the maximum value \(c\):**

   - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\), the maximum value \(c\) would be as large as possible. To find the maximum value, we need to minimize \(a\).

   - Let \(a\) be the smallest integer possible while keeping \(a \leq b =  24\). The smallest possible \(a\) is 1 (assuming \(a\) is a positive integer).

   - Thus:
     \[
     1 + c = 96 \implies c = 96 - 1 = 95
     \]

   The largest of the three numbers is \(\boxed{95}\).

"To find the value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Simplify the left-hand side:**
   Notice that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial:
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

4. **Take the square root of both sides:**
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4096}
    \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   |x - 2| = 64
   \]

5. **Solve the absolute value equation:**
   The absolute value equation \( |x - 2| = 64 \) has two solutions:
   \[
   x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \) in each case:**
   \[
   x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
   \]
   \[
   x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62
   \]

7. **Verify the solutions:**
   We need to check if both solutions satisfy the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

   For \( x = 66 \):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} =  \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
   \]
   This solution does not satisfy the original equation.

   For \( x = -62 \):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
   \]
   This solution also does not satisfy the original equation.

Since neither solution satisfies the original equation, there must be no real value of \( x \) that satisfies \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\). Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{No real solution}}

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2  \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2 in a geometric progression. Specifically, for \(n = 4\), the product \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\) is known to be \(\frac{1}{16}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16 }.

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), and there is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

Let \(M\) be the midpoint of \(BC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude and median, \(BM = MC\) and \(AM = 11\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

Now, consider \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\ angle DBC = \angle DCB = 90^\circ - \theta\), we can use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):

\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{CD}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)}
\]

Since \(BD = CD\), we have:

\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{x}{\cos \theta}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2 \cos \theta = \sin 3\theta
\]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta\), we get:

\[
2 \cos \theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\cos \theta\), we have:

\[
2 = 3 \tan \theta - 4 \tan^3 \theta
\]

Let \(t = \tan \theta\). Then the equation  becomes:

\[
4t^3 - 3t + 2 = 0
\]

By trial, we find that \(t = 1\) is a root. Therefore, \(\tan \theta = 1\), which means \(\theta = 45^\circ\). So, \(\angle BAC = 2\theta = 90^\circ\).

Since \(\angle BAC = 90^\circ\), triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 45^\circ\). Therefore, \(AB = AC\) and \(BC = AB\sqrt{2}\).

Since \(AM\) is the altitude and median, \(AM = 11\) and \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Therefore, \(BM = MC = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{AB\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

In \(\triangle ABM\), we have:

\[
AM^2 = AB^2 - BM^2
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
11^2 = AB^2 - \left(\frac{AB\sqrt{2}} {2}\right)^2
\]

\[
121 = AB^2 - \frac{2AB^2}{4}
\]

\[
121 = AB^2 - \frac{AB^2}{2}
\]

\[
121 = \frac{AB^2}{2}
\]

\[
AB^2 = 242
\]

\[
AB = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

Since \(AB = AC\) and \(BC = AB\sqrt{2} = 11\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 22\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1)
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\boxed{44}\).``````

"To determine the range of values for \( x \) such that \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the function \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \)
First, observe that \( f(x) \) is a polynomial function and is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares:
\[ x^4 \geq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 4x^2 \geq 0 \]
Thus, \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \).

### Step 2: Find the minimum value of \( f(x) \)
To find the minimum value, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 4x^3 + 8x \]
\[ f'(x) = 4x(x^2 + 2) \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero:
\[ 4x(x^2 + 2) = 0 \]
This gives us :
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 2 = 0 \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \) has no real solutions, the only critical point is \( x = 0 \).

Evaluate \( f(x) \) at this critical point:
\[ f(0) = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0 \]
Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 0.

### Step 3: Determine the range of \( f(x) \)
Since \( f(x) \) is continuous and has a minimum value of 0, and it increases without bound as \( x \) moves away from 0 (because \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) both grow as \( |x| \) increases), the range of \( f(x) \) is:
\[ [0, \infty) \]

### Step 4: Solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)
Given the range of \( f(x) \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that:
 \[ 0 \leq x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]
Since \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) is always true, we only need to solve:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

### Step 5: Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)
Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]
Rearrange to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]
Solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}  \]
This gives us:
\[ y = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -7 \]
Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( y \geq 0 \), we discard \( y = -7 \) and keep \( y = 3 \).

The quadratic \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) holds for:
\[ -7 < y < 3 \]
Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Conclusion
The range of \( x \) such that \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
So,
 \[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then,
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we need to find another equation involving \(s\) and \(p\). From the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\), we get :
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12,
\]
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we get \(p = \frac{24}{s}\). Substituting this into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s \left( s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s} \right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
So,
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then,
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

Thus, the value of \( xy + yz + zx\) is:

First, let's identify the number of boys and girls in the 12th year of high school. The problem states that there are 300 boys and 300 girls in the 12th year of high school.

According to the table, the percentage of boys who are buss(vars in the 12th year of high school is 11.6%. Similarly, the percentage of girls who are buss(vars in the 12th year of high school is 8.6%.

Now, we need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are buss(vars. The number of boys who are buss(vars is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to consider the conditions under which the fraction is negative. A fraction is negative if the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[ |x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|, \]
\[ x^2 - 36x = x(x-36). \]

The inequality becomes:
\[ \frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0. \]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Since the absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, it will be zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\), and positive otherwise. Therefore, the sign of the entire fraction depends on the signs of \(x\) and \(x-36\).

Let's analyze the critical points and the intervals determined by them : \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - \(x = -10\) is negative.
   - \(x-36 = -46\) is negative.
   - The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive (since both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative).
   - The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (negative times negative).
   - The fraction \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is positive.
   - So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - \(x = -1\) is negative.
   -  \(x-36 = -37\) is negative.
   - The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive (since both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative).
   - The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (negative times negative).
   - The fraction \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is positive.
   - So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 36)\):**
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - \(x = 1\) is positive.
   - \(x-36 = -35\) is negative.
   - The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive (since \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive).
   - The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (positive times negative).
   - The fraction \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative.
   - So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. **Interval \ ((36, \infty)\):**
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - \(x = 37\) is positive.
   - \(x-36 = 1\) is positive.
   - The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive (since both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive).
   - The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (positive times positive).
   - The fraction \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is positive.
   - So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Finally, we need to check the critical points:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the fraction is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the fraction is undefined.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the fraction is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the interval \((0, 36)\).

所以，subing area 的 面积 是 \(\boxed{396}\) square meters。```**

```
\boxed{396}
``` 

**答案**：\(\boxed{396}\) square meters。 

**Analysis**:
1. The width of the field is determined by the diameter of each semicircle, which is 2 meters.
2. The length of the field is calculated by subtracting the radius of the semicircles from the total length of the field. The total length of the field is divided by 2 to get 200 meters.
3. The radius of the semicircles is half of the diameter, which is 1 meter.
4. Therefore, the length of the field is \(200 - 2 \times","[396, '396']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],False
"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle T = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).

"To find the value of \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) for the given function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to determine the vertex of the parabola represented by the function. The vertex form of a parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) gives us the vertex at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

Here, the function is \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). We can rewrite it as \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \). This is in the form \( y = ax^2 + c \) where \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( c = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \).

The vertex of the parabola occurs at \( x = 0 \) because there is no \( x \)-term (i.e., \( b = 0 \)). Substituting \( x = 0 \)  into the equation, we get:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

Thus, the vertex of the parabola is at \( (0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}) \). The distance from the vertex to the x-axis is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \).

We need to express \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \) in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \). To do this, we rationalize the denominator:
\[ \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}. \]

Here, \( a = 18 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers and \( a \) is not a perfect square, the value of \( a + b \) is:
\[ a + b = 18 + 2 = 20. \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \ boxed{20}. \]```


```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define the function
y = (1/sp.sqrt(2))*(x**2 - 3)

# Find the vertex
vertex_x = 0
vertex_y = y.subs(x, vertex_x)

# Simplify the vertex y-coordinate
vertex_y = sp.simplify(vertex_y)

# Express the y-coordinate in the form sqrt(a)/b
a = 18
b = 2

# Calculate a + b

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the piecewise function separately.

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x \):
    \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Thus, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
    Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, which can be challenging to solve analytically. However, we can test some values:
   - For \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \quad (\text{not a solution})
     \]
   - For \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     -5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^2 +  3 \cdot 5 = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \quad (\text{not a solution})
     \]
   - For \( x = 6 \):
     \[
     -6^3 + 2 \cdot 6^2 + 3 \cdot 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 = -126 \quad (\text{not a solution})
     \]

Since the cubic equation does not yield a simple solution and we have already found a corresponding value for \( f^{-1}(0) \), we conclude that \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Summing the Inverses

\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).```\\n
\boxed{0}```\\n

"To determine which of the given points is closest to the point \(P = (1.2, 1.5, 1)\), we need to calculate the Euclidean distance from \(P\) to each of the given points. The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\) in three-dimensional space is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]

We will calculate the distance from \(P\) to each of the points \(A = (1, 0, 0)\), \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\), \(C = (0, 1, 0)\), \(D = (0, -1, 0)\), and \(E = (0, 0, 1)\).

1. Distance from \(P\) to \(A\):
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(1 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 +  (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-0.2)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{0.04 + 2.25 + 1} = \sqrt{3.29} \approx 1.81
\]

2. Distance from \(P\) to \(B\):
\[
d_B = \sqrt{(-1 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-2.2)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4.84 + 2.25 + 1} = \sqrt{8.09} \approx 2.84
\]

3. Distance from \(P\) to \(C\):
\[
d_C = \sqrt{(0 - 1.2)^2 + (1 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-1.2)^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{1.44 +  0.25 + 1} = \sqrt{2.69} \approx 1.64
\]

4. Distance from \(P\) to \(D\):
\[
d_D = \sqrt{(0 - 1.2)^2 + (-1 - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-1.2)^2 + (-2.5)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{1.44 + 6.25 + 1} = \sqrt{8.69} \approx 2.95
\]

5. Distance from \(P\) to \(E\):
\[
d_E = \sqrt{(0 - 1.2)^2 + (0 - 1.5)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-1.2)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (0)^2} = \sqrt{1.44 + 2.25 + 0} = \sqrt{3.69} \approx 1.92
\]

Comparing the distances, we see that the smallest distance is \(d_C  \approx 1.64\), which corresponds to the point \(C = (0, 1, 0)\).

Therefore, the closest point to \(P\) is \(\boxed{C}\).```python

"To solve the problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force (kraft) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object times its acceleration (a):

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

We are given that the force (kraft) acting on the softball and the baseball is the same. Let's denote this force by \( F \). The mass of the softball is 200 grams, and the mass of the baseball is 150 grams. We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball.

First, let's express the force in terms of the mass and acceleration for both the softball and the baseball. For the softball, we have:

\[ F = 200 \cdot a_s \]

For the baseball, we have:

\[ F = 150 \cdot a_b \]

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 \cdot a_s = 150 \cdot a_b \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball  to the acceleration of the baseball, which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \). To find this ratio, we can solve the equation for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine if the number \(629_{10}\) can be represented using the same digits in both base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases and then compare the digits.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track  of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in base 7 and base 8
The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6, and the digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5. Clearly, the digits are not the same in both representations.

### Step 4: Check if \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) have a common digit
We convert both numbers to base 10 to compare their digits.

####  Convert \(121_3\) to base 10
\[
121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}
\]

#### Convert \(413_5\) to base 10
\[
413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 1 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 1 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108_{10}
\]

The digits of \(121_3\) are 1, 2, and 1, and the digits of \(413_5\) are 4, 1, and 3. The common digit is 1.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people were at the math conference and how many handshakes occurred, given that each person was supposed to shake hands with every other person exactly once, but one person was not present.

Let's denote the total number of people at the conference as \( n \). If all \( n \) people were present, the total number of handshakes would be given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

However, since one person was not present, the number of people present is \( n-1 \). The number of handshakes among \( n-1 \) people is \( \binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \).

We are given that the number of handshakes is 44. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 44
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 88
\]
Now, we need to find the integer \(  n \) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by testing values of \( n \):
\[
n-1 = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad n-2 = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad n-1 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad n-2 = 11
\]
From \( n-1 = 11 \), we get \( n = 12 \). From \( n-1 = 8 \), we get \( n = 9 \). However, if \( n = 9 \), then \( n-2 = 7 \), and \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \), which does not equal 88. Therefore, the only valid solution is \( n = 12 \).

So, the total number of people at the conference is \( n = 12 \), and the number of people present is \( n-1 = 11 \).

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form of the line is:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Plugging these values into the distance formula, we get:

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

- \( D = (-a, -b) \)

The center \( O \) of the rectangle is at \((0,0)\).

The distance from \( O \) to any vertex is:
\[
OA = OB = OC = OD = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

Next, we need to consider the distances from \( O \) to the sides of the rectangle. The distances from \( O \) to each side are:
- To side \( AB \): \( b \)
- To side \( BC \): \( a \)
- To side \( CD \): \( b \)
- To side \( DA \ ): \( a \)

For \( O \) to be closer to one of the vertices than to \( O \), the distance from \( O \) to a vertex must be less than the distance from \( O \) to the nearest side. This means:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} < \min(a, b)
\]

However, this inequality is never true because \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) is always greater than or equal to \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, \( O \) is never closer to a vertex than to \( O \).

Thus, the probability that \( O \) is closer to one of the vertices than to \( O \) is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]```python
\end{document}```

The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\). The probability that the center \( O \) of the rectangle \( ABCD \) is closer to one of the vertices than to \( O \) is \(\boxed{0}\). This is because the distance from \( O \) to any vertex is always greater than or equal to the distance from \( O \) to the nearest side of the rectangle.","[0, '0']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To solve the problem of finding the best decomposition of 54 modulo 6, we start by understanding what ""54 (mod 6)"" means. This expression asks for the remainder when 54 is divided by 6.

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]
Since 54 divided by 6 is exactly 9 with no remainder, we can express this as:
\[ 54 = 6 \times 9 + 0 \]
Here, the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In mathematical terms, we write:
\[ 54 \equiv 0 \pmod{6} \]

Thus, the best decomposition of 54 modulo 6 is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]```

This is the final answer. The best decomposition of 54 modulo 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).```

The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).```

This is the final answer. The best decomposition of 54 modulo 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).```

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function:

\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{om } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{om } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

### Step 1: Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \)
First, we need to determine the value of \(\frac{\pi}{3}\):
\[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

###  Step 2: Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \)
Next, we need to determine the value of \(\sqrt{45}\):
\[ \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708. \]
Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

### Step 3: Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \)
Finally, we need to determine the value of \(8^{2/3}\):
\[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4. \]
Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

### Step 4: Sum the results
Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt {45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]```

"To find the average score of the test results, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Determine the total number of students.
3. Divide the total sum of the scores by the total number of students to get the average score.

Let's start with the first step:

The number of students who scored 80 is 20. So, the total score for these students is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The number of students who scored 90 is 8. So, the total score for these students is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The number of students who scored 100 is 2. So, the total score for these students is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add all these scores together to get the total sum of all the scores:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we determine the total number of students. According to the problem, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 + 8  + 2 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total sum of the scores by the total number of students to get the average score:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

"To solve for \( n \) in the given 3x3 magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this is also the common sum \( S \), we have :
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the third row with \( n = 7 \):
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
And the common sum \( S \) should be 15, so let's check the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
And the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
And the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) =  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
And the diagonals:
First diagonal:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
Second diagonal:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]
Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\). \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \] \","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"给定方程 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，我们知道 \(\omega\) 是一个单位的立方根。单位的立方根是复数 \(1, \omega,\) 和 \(\omega^2\)，其中 \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) 和 \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\)。这些根满足方程 \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\)。

我们需要找到表达式的值：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]

首先，我们简化 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\)。因为 \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\)，我们有 \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\)。因此，
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} = -\frac{ 1}{\omega^2}.
\]

同样地，对于 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\)，我们有 \(1 + \omega^2 = -\omega\)。因此，
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

将这些结果相加，我们得到：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

为了合并这些项，我们找到一个共同的分母：
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{\omega^3}\right).
\]

因为 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，我们有：
\[
-\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{1}\right) = -(\omega + \omega^2).
\]

使用恒等式 \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\)， 我们得到 \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\)。因此，
\[
-(\omega + \omega^2) = -(-1) = 1.

"To determine the longest possible path that visits each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once and returns to the starting point, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The point with the longest total distance will be the longest possible path.

Let's denote the distances between the points as follows:
- \(AB = d_1\)
- \(AC = d_2\)
- \(AD = d_3\)
- \(BC = d_4\)
- \(BD = d_5\)
- \(CD = d_6\)

We need to calculate the total distance for each permutation of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

1. Permutation \(A \to B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD + DA = d_1 + d_4 + d_6 + d_3
   \]

2. Permutation \(A \to B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC + CA = d_1 + d_5 +  d_6 + d_2
   \]

3. Permutation \(A \to C \to B \to D \to A\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD + DA = d_2 + d_4 + d_5 + d_3
   \]

4. Permutation \(A \to C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB + BA = d_2 + d_6 + d_5 + d_1
   \]

5. Permutation \(A \to D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC + CA = d_3 + d_5 + d_4 + d_2
   \]

6. Permutation \(A \to D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB + BA = d_3 + d_6 + d_4 + d_1
   \]

Now, we compare the total distances of all these permutations:
- \(d_1 + d_4 + d_6 + d_3\)
- \(d_1 + d_5 +  d_6 + d_2\)
- \(d_2 + d_4 + d_5 + d_3\)
- \(d_2 + d_6 + d_5 + d_1\)
- \(d_3 + d_5 + d_4 + d_2\)
- \(d_3 + d_6 + d_4 + d_1\)

To find the longest path, we need to know the specific distances \(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5,\) and \(d_6\). However, without specific values, we can't determine the exact longest path. But the method to find it is clear: calculate the total distance for each permutation and choose the one with the maximum distance.

Therefore, the longest possible path that visits each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once and returns to the starting point is the permutation that yields the maximum total distance. In terms of the given distances, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The longest path is the permutation that gives the maximum total distance.}}
