"To determine if \(DE\) is the hypotenuse in the right triangle \(DEF\), we need to identify which sides are the legs and which side is the hypotenuse. From the diagram, we can see that \(DF\) and \(EF\) are the legs of the right triangle, and \(DE\) is the hypotenuse.

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}\). Since \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the following equation:

\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\). \]``````

"To find the complex number \( w \), we start with the given complex numbers \( z \) and \( c \). The complex number \( z \) is given by \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) and the complex number \( c \) is given by \( c = 2 - 3i \). The task is to find \( w \), which is obtained by rotating \( z \) about \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction.

First, we need to express the rotation in the complex plane. A rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, we need to compute \( w = c + (z - c)e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \).

Let's break this down step-by-step.

1 . Compute \( z - c \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. Multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Distribute the terms:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. Add this result to \( c \):
   \[
   w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize the number under the square root into its prime factors and then simplify.

First, let's factorize 242:
- 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 242 by 2, we get:
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, we can write:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 121
  \]

Next, we factorize 121:
- 121 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd), but it is divisible by 11. Dividing 121 by 11, we get:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, we can write:
  \[
  121 = 11 \times 11
  \]

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

 Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}
\]

We can simplify the square root by taking out the pair of 11s:
\[
\sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = 11 \sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:
\[
\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}

"To determine how many different ways the 8 duduk can sit around a round table given that 3 specific dudok (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 specific dudok as a single unit:**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super dudok."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 dudos and the other 5 individual dudos) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the 3 dudos within their block:**
   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange the 3  dudok within their block is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 dudok around the table with the given condition, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange the 3 dudok within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the number of different ways the 8 dudok can sit around the table is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any positive integer \(n\),

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the power of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\) is zero. Let's determine the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\ text{Exponent of } x \text{ in } (10x^3)^{5-k} = 3(5-k) = 15 - 3k
\]

\[
\text{Exponent of } x \text{ in } \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = -2k
\]

Adding these exponents together gives the total exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3 } = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{3 \cdot 2} = 100x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that when \( n \) is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. We need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by first finding the remainders of each number when divided by 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
 \[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 = 7 \cdot 1 + 1\text{)}
\]

Now substitute these remainders back into the expression:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify the product:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Therefore,

\[

The remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).``````","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated to bring a regular pentagon back to its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry. This means that if we rotate the pentagon by a certain angle, it will look exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The smallest such angle of rotation is the angle that corresponds to rotating the pentagon by one-fifth of a full turn (360 degrees).

To find this angle, we divide 360 degrees by the number of sides of the pentagon, which is 5:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated to bring the regular pentagon back to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).\\

"To find the coordinates of the fourth point \((x, y)\) on the line that passes through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we first need to determine the equation of the line.

The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), the slope is:
\[ m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \]

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:
\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]

Using the point \((5, 3)\) and the slope \(m = 5\), the equation of the line is:
\[ y - 3 = 5(x - 5 ) \]
\[ y - 3 = 5x - 25 \]
\[ y = 5x - 22 \]

We know that the point \((x, y)\) lies on this line, so it must satisfy the equation \(y = 5x - 22\). Given that \(x > 7\), we can substitute \(x = 8\) (since it is the next integer greater than 7) to find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate:
\[ y = 5(8) - 22 = 40 - 22 = 18 \]

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth point are \((8, 18)\). To find the value of \(x + y\):

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is:

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to find its vertical and horizontal asymptotes. Let's start with the vertical asymptotes.

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, i.e., we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
We can factorize this quadratic equation as:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator , the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

"To solve \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use a method that simplifies the calculation by recognizing a pattern. Let's break it down step by step.

First, observe that \(99\) can be written as \(100 - 1\). This will help us use algebraic identities to simplify the expression.

1. **Rewrite \(99\) as \(100 - 1\):**
   \[

The norm of the matrix \( A \) is given by the operator norm, which is the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 16}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{ 17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}

The eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, which are \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \) and \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \). The largest singular value is 4. Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4, and the smallest \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is:

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be one of the roots of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, we note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3  \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

Thus, the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

###  Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the first term of the expression as follows:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator for \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\) and \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
 So the expression now is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\). Substitute this into the numerator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To determine how many treeks are needed to have the same weight as one squig, we need to first express the weight of one treek in terms of squigs and goolees, and then convert it to the number of squigs.

Let's denote the weight of one treek as \( T \), the weight of one squig as \( S \), and the weight of one goolee as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. One treek is equivalent to three squigs and one goolee:
\[ T = 3S + G \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee are equivalent to one squig:
\[ 2T + G = S \]

We need to find the weight of one treek in terms of squigs. To do this, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the first equation into the second equation. First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = T - 3S \]

Now substitute \( G = T - 3S \) into the second equation:
\[ 2T + (T - 3S) = S \]
\[ 3T - 3S = S  \]
\[ 3T = 4S \]
\[ T = \frac{4S}{3} \]

So, the weight of one treek is \(\frac{4S}{3}\). This means that one treek is equivalent to \(\frac{4}{3}\) squigs. Therefore, the number of treeks needed to have the same weight as one squig is the reciprocal of \(\frac{4}{3}\), which is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

Thus, the number of treeks needed to have the same weight as one squig is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]``````

This is the final answer. The number of treeks needed to have the same weight as one squig is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).```

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) such that their product is \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The product of \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like  terms, we get:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know this must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:
1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\) (This is already true, so we don't get any new information from this term.)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term, we can solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\ ]
Now substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
We verify these values with the equation for \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Finally, we need to find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]
Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).```

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the given information about the rate of water flow and the rate at which the water level rises.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The rate at which water is being added to the tank is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour.
   - The rate at which the water level is rising is 1 meter per hour.

2. **Relate the volume of water added to the rate of the water level rise:**
   The volume of water added to the tank per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises. The cross-sectional area of a cylinder is given by the formula for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder. Since the water level rises at a rate of 1 meter per hour, the volume of water added per hour is also equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank.

   Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \pi r^2 \cdot 1 = 20\pi
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   \pi r^ 2 = 20\pi

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) does not intersect any horizontal line more than once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) and its behavior at the point where the definition changes, i.e., at \( x = a \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's find the value of the function at \( x = a \):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Now, we need to ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) does not intersect any horizontal line more than once. This means that the function \( f(x) \) must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing in the interval \( (-\infty, a) \) and \( [a, \infty) \), and the value of \( f(a) \) must be such that it does not create any intersections with horizontal lines.

 Consider the function \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \). For this linear function to be strictly increasing, the slope \( a \) must be positive. So, \( a > 0 \).

Next, consider the function \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \). For this quadratic function to be strictly increasing, the coefficient \( a \) must be positive. So, \( a > 0 \).

Now, we need to ensure that the value of \( f(a) = a^3 \) is such that it does not create any intersections with horizontal lines. This means that the value \( a^3 \) should be less than or equal to the value of the linear function at \( x = a \), i.e., \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \).

Solving the inequality \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0, \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0, \]
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \le q 0. \]

Since \( a > 0 \), we only consider the intervals where the product \( a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0 \) is valid for positive \( a \). The roots of the equation \( a(a-2)(a+1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0, a = 2, a = -1 \). Since \( a > 0 \), we only consider the interval \( 0 < a \leq 2 \).

Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) does not intersect any horizontal line more than once is \( a = 2 \).

\[

"To determine if the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

The given equation is:
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]

First, we need to complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[x^2 - 10x\]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25\]
This can be written as:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25\]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[y^2 + 6y\]
To complete the square,  we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, and then square it to get 9. So, we add and subtract 9:
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9\]
This can be written as:
\[(y + 3)^2 - 9\]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\) and solve for \(c\):
\[34 - c = 1\]
\[c = 33\]

Thus,  the value of \(c\) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \), which simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda\), or \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a valid fixed point for \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). This means we need to solve \(f(f(x)) = x\) and exclude the fixed points \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

First, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve:

\]
 Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.

This gives us the solutions \(x = 0\) and:
\[

\]

We can use the angle sum and difference identities for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B,

\[

\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B -  \cos A \sin B.

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).

Using the angle difference identities, we get:

\[

\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50 ^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will analyze the function step by step.

First, let's consider the domain of the function. The expressions under the square roots, \(1 - y^2\) and \(1 - x^2\), must be non-negative, which is true for all \(x\) and \(y\) in the interval \([-1, 1]\).

To find the maximum value, we can start by examining the function at some specific points. Let's try \(x = y\):
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
We need to maximize \(2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). Let's denote \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To find the critical points, we take the derivative  of \(g(x)\) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

"To find the area of the parallelogram \(OAB\) formed by vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), we need to compute the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

The vectors are given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the unit vectors \(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\) and the components of \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\ ]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
 \]

The magnitude of this vector is given by:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \(\theta\). The given equation can be rewritten using the exponential form:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This is equivalent to:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) is one of the angles whose cosine is \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\). We know that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic  equation, we get:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm i\sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm i\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

This gives us two  possible values for \( z \):

\[ z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} + i\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \quad \text{or} \quad z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - i\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

These are the roots of the quadratic equation, and they are complex conjugates. We can represent them in polar form as \( z = e^{i\phi} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\phi} \), where \( \cos\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \sin\phi = \pm \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the given triangle \(ABC\) and the smaller triangle \(W概括 with \(ABC\).

1. **Identify the Key Points and Lines:**
   - \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
   - The medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) intersect at \(G\).
   - A line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\).

2. **Properties of the Centroid and Parallel Line:**
   - Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Therefore, \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
   - A line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) will intersect \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\) respectively, such that \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) in the same  ratio as \(G\) divides the medians. This ratio is 1:2 because \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.

3. **Area Relationship:**
   - The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) creates a smaller triangle \(W\) that is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1:3\) (since \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, the smaller triangle is one-third the height and one-third the base of the larger triangle).
   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its linear dimensions. Therefore, the area of triangle \(W\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \(W\):**
   - The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144.
   - The area of triangle \(W\) is \(\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

"To determine the probability that at least one of the three selected buses are math books, we can use the complementary probability approach. This involves calculating the probability that none of the three selected buses are math books and then subtracting this from 1.

First, let's identify the total number of buses and the number of math books:
- Total buses: 24
- Math books: 8
- Non-math books: 24 - 8 = 16

We need to find the probability that none of the three selected buses are math books. This is equivalent to selecting all three buses from the 16 non-math books.

The number of ways to choose 3 buses from 16 non-math books is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\):
\[
\binom{16}{3} = \frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!} = \frac{16!}{3! \cdot 13!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 560
\]

 The number of ways to choose 3 buses from the total 24 buses is:
\[
\binom{24}{3} = \frac{24!}{3!(24-3)!} = \frac{24!}{3! \cdot 21!} = \frac{24 \times 23 \times 22}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2024
\]

The probability that none of the three selected buses are math books is the ratio of these two combinations:
\[
P(\text{no math books}) = \frac{\binom{16}{3}}{\binom{24}{3}} = \frac{560}{2024} = \frac{70}{253}
\]

Therefore, the probability that at least one of the three selected buses is a math book is:
\[
P(\text{at least one math book}) = 1 - P(\text{no math books}) = 1 - \frac{70}{253} = \frac{253}{253} - \frac{70}{253} =  \frac{183}{253}
\]

So, the probability that at least one of the three selected buses is a math book is:

Next, we multiply this product by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

"To determine the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to use the information given about the fourth and eighth terms. Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]

Given:
- The fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200.
- The eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500.

Using the formula for the fourth term:
\[
a_4 = a + 3d = 200
\]

Using the formula for the eighth term:
\[
a_8 = a + 7d = 500
\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200
\]
\[
4d  = 300
\]
\[
d = 75
\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[
a + 3(75) = 200
\]
\[
a + 225 = 200
\]
\[
a = 200 - 225
\]
\[
a = -25
\]

With \(a = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the fifth term (\(a_5\)) using the general formula:
\[
a_5 = a + 4d
\]
\[
a_5 = -25 + 4(75)

\[
a_5 = -25 + 300

\[

Therefore, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{275}\).```

"To determine the values of \( n \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a^n simple number, we need to understand the definition of a simple number. A simple number is one that can be expressed as \( n^k \) where \( n \) and \( k \) are positive integers with \( k > 1 \).

Given \( 2^{24} \), we need to express it in the form \( n^k \) where \( k > 1 \). This means we need to find all the divisors of 24 (since \( k \) must be a divisor of 24) and check if \( 2^{24} \) can be written as \( n^k \) for each divisor \( k \) of 24.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Since \( k > 1 \), we exclude 1. So, we consider \( k = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \).

1. If \( k = 2  \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), so \( n = 2^{12} = 4096 \).
2. If \( k = 3 \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \), so \( n = 2^8 = 256 \).
3. If \( k = 4 \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \), so \( n = 2^6 = 64 \).
4. If \( k = 6 \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 \), so \( n = 2^4 = 16 \).
5. If \( k = 8 \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 \), so \( n = 2^3 = 8 \).
6. If \( k = 12 \), then \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \), so \( n = 2^2 = 4 \).
7. If \( k = 24  \), then \( 2^{24} = 2^{24} \), so \( n = 2 \).

Thus, the values of \( n \) that satisfy the condition are \( 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 256, 4096 \). Therefore, the possible values of \( n \) are:

"To determine how many nickels优化 the total value of 75 se negai, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

1. Let \( d \) represent the number of dimes.
2. Let \( n \) represent the number of nickels.

We know the following:
- Each dime is worth 10 se negai.
- Each nickel is worth 5 se negai.
- The total value of the dimes and nickels combined is 75 se negai.

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \]

3. To simplify the equation, we divide every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

4. We need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( d \) and \( n \). We will solve for \( n \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ n = 15 - 2d \]

5. Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 15 - 2d \geq 0 \). Solving for \( d \):
\[ 15 \geq 2d \]
 \[ d \leq \frac{15}{2} \]
\[ d \leq 7.5 \]

Since \( d \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( d \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

6. We now find the corresponding values of \( n \) for each integer value of \( d \):
- If \( d = 0 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(0) = 15 \)
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(1) = 13 \)
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(2) = 11 \)
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(3) = 9 \)
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(4) = 7 \)
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(5) = 5 \ )
- If \( d = 6 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(6) = 3 \)
- If \( d = 7 \), then \( n = 15 - 2(7) = 1 \)

7. Among these solutions, we need to determine which combination of dimes and nickels results in the maximum number of nickels. From the list above, the maximum number of nickels is 15 when \( d = 0 \).

"To determine the value of \( b \) given that the point \((a, b)\) lies on the line with the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\) and \(a = 4\), we can substitute \(a = 4\) into the equation and solve for \(b\).

The given equation of the line is:

"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given diagram, we need to calculate the area of each shaded triangle and then sum these areas.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the shaded triangles. The diagram shows two shaded triangles:
1. The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the first triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values for the first triangle:
\[
\text{ Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the second triangle
The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.
The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.
Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]

### Step 3: Sum the areas of the two triangles
The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \text{Area}_1 + \text{Area}_2 = 4 + 6 = 10
\]

Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"To solve the problem of finding the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to understand the properties of 450 and how it interact with numbers composed only of the digits 0 and 1.

First, note that 450 can be factored into prime factors as follows:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]
This means that any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. 

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Since the only digits are 0 and 1, the number must have a sum of digits equal to 9 or a multiple of 9.
3. **Divisibility by 25**: The last two digits of the number must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the only digits are 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

Given these constraints,  we need to find the smallest number that satisfies all of them. Let's construct such a number step by step.

- The number must end in 00.
- The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the only digits are 0 and 1, the number must have exactly 9 ones (because 9 is the smallest multiple of 9 that can be formed by 0s and 1s).

Therefore, the smallest number that meets all these criteria is 11111111100. Let's verify:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2 and 25.
- The sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 9.
- It is divisible by 450.

Thus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1 is:

"To determine the probability that the bidak will be counted in both the piop and bar for a specific digit, we need to analyze the given conditions and calculate the probability step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- The bidak is counted in the piop if the digit is 1, 2, or 3.
- The bidak is counted in the bar if the digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We need to find the probability that the bidak is counted in both the piop and bar.

### Step 2: Identify the Common Digits
For the bidak to be counted in both the piop and bar, the digit must be one of the digits that are common to both sets:
- Digits counted in piop: 1, 2, 3
- Digits counted in bar: 1, 2, 3, 4

The common digits are: 1, 2, 3

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
Each digit from 1 to 9 is equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, the probability of choosing any specific digit is:
\[ P(\text{any digit}) = \frac{ 1}{9} \]

The probability of choosing one of the common digits (1, 2, or 3) is:
\[ P(\text{common digit}) = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \]

### Step 4: Conclusion
The probability that the bidak will be counted in both the piop and bar is:
\[

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\). This is the probability that the bidak will be counted in both the piop and bar.

The solution requires careful consideration of the problem statement and the application of basic probability rules.

"To find the sum of the digits of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) in its decimal representation, we start by simplifying the denominator.

First, we note that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]
Next, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This division gives us:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]
Now, we identify the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\).  The digits are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. To find the sum of these digits, we add them together:
\[

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), let's analyze the equation step by step.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates:**
   - \( r \) represents the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
   - \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Equation Analysis:**
   - The equation \( z = c \) states that the \( z \)-coordinate is a constant value \( c \).
   - This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the height \( z \) does not change; it is always \( c \).

3. **Visualizing the Shape:**
   - Since \( z \) is constant, the points lie on a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane at height \( z = c \).
   - The radial distance \( r \) and the angular coordinate \( \theta \) can vary, meaning the points can be at any distance from the \( z \)-axis and at any angle in the \( xy \)-plane.

 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The set of all points \((r, \theta, z)\) where \( z = c \) forms a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).
   - This plane is a horizontal flat surface that extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions.

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

First, calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\ | = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Now, substitute the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) and the magnitude of their cross product into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \(g(x) = f(x+5)\), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \(f(x)\) and the roots of \(g(x)\).

Given the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015\), the roots of \(f(x)\) are the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = 0\). Let's denote these roots by \(r_1, r_2,\) and \(r_3\). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \(f(x)\) is given by the coefficient of \(x^2\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \(f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015\), the sum of the roots \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3\) is:

\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49
\]

Now, consider the function \(g(x) = f(x+5)\ ). The roots of \(g(x)\) are the values of \(x\) for which \(g(x) = 0\), which means \(f(x+5) = 0\). If \(r_1, r_2,\) and \(r_3\) are the roots of \(f(x)\), then the roots of \(g(x)\) are \(r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5,\) and \(r_3 - 5\). This is because if \(x = r_i - 5\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3\), then \(x + 5 = r_i\), and thus \(f(x+5) = f(r_i) = 0\).

The sum of the roots of \(g(x)\) is therefore:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2  20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\). So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To simplify further, we use the triple angle identity for tangent, which states that \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). Setting \(x = 10^\circ\), we get \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\ circ}\). This identity helps us relate \(\tan 10^\circ\) to \(\tan 30^\circ\), but it is not directly useful for our current purpose.

Instead, we use the known result from trigonometric sum identities that:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = 12.

This result can be derived from more advanced trigonometric sum identities or by using known values and properties of trigonometric functions. For the purpose of this problem, we can accept this result as valid.

According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[

\]

Next, we solve for \( n \). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

Performing the division, we find:

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6.  Therefore, we have:

We need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We test values to find \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). Testing values, we find:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we start by identifying the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply these two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
\]

Subtracting these values gives:
\[
25 - 3 = 22
\]

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\)  and its conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{22}\).```

We need to find the 2003rd term of this sequence. Substituting \(a = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

Then performing the multiplication:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse trigonometric functions \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\).

Recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because if \(\theta = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\), then \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\tan \theta = x\), so \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

 Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), so \(\tan \theta = x\). We need to find \(\sin (2\theta)\). Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:

\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta.
\]

Since \(\tan \theta = x\), we can express \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\) in terms of \(x\). If we consider a right triangle where the opposite side to \(\theta\) is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, then the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle formula, we get:

\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right ) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}.
\]

We know that \(\sin (2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get:

\[
6x = x^2 + 1.
\]

Rearranging terms gives us a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

\[ \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \]

First, we check if the direction vectors are parallel. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points defining the rectangle range from \(-5\) to \(5\), not including the endpoints. Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us a total of 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

To find the total number of integer coordinate points within the interior of the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values  for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. First, we expand the expression:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, we have \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
 \]

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Also, the cross product is anti-commutative, so \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these into our expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1  \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

1. **Identify the properties and relationships:**
   - Since \( \overline{AC} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{CD} \), \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
   - \( \overline{AC} \) passes through the midpoint of \( \angle BAD \), implying that \( \overline{AC} \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAD \).

2. **Express the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \):**
   The area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is given by:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times  h
   \]
   where \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid, which is the length of \( \overline{AC} \).

3. **Express the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \):**
   The area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h

   where \( AD \) is the base and \( h \) is the height.

4. **Express the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \):**
   The area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is:
   \[
   [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h
   \]
   where \( BC \) is the base and \( h \) is the height.

5. **Relate the areas of the triangles to the trapezoid:**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height for both triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \), the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
   \[
   [ ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for the areas of the triangles, we get:
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h
   \]
   Factor out \( \frac{1}{2} \times h \):
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times (AD + BC)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   84 = h \times (AD + BC)
   \]
   Therefore, the height \( h \) of the trapezoid is:
   \[
   h = \frac{84}{AD + BC}
   \]

6. **Find the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \):**
   The area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) is:

   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h

   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:

4.  **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\):

- For \(\frac{10}{21}\), we have \(p = 10\) and \(q = 21\).

Next, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:

So the expression becomes:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen independently and randomly from a circle, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the circle and the segments.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) chosen independently and randomly on the circumference of the circle.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Insight:**
   - For two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.
   - This means that if we list the points in the order they appear when moving around the circle, they must alternate. For example, the order could be \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), but not \(A, B, C, D\) or \(A, B, D,  C\).

3. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements:**
   - There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange 4 points around a circle. However, since the circle has no starting point and can be rotated, we consider the arrangements up to rotation. This reduces the number of distinct arrangements to \(\frac{4!}{4} = 6\) distinct circular permutations.
   - Out of these 6 distinct permutations, only 2 will have the points alternating (i.e., \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\)).
   - Therefore, the probability that \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct permutations, which is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

   - The area of the larger circle (radius 2) is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{large}} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
     \]
   - The area of the smaller circle (radius 1) is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
     \]

3. **Determine the area of the annulus (the ring between the two circles):**
   - The area of the annulus is the difference between the areas of the larger and smaller circles:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{annulus}} = 4\pi - \pi  = 3\pi
     \]

4. **Given that the shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:**
   - The shaded area is:
     \[
     \text{Shaded Area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
     \]

5. **The shaded area is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   - Let \( \theta \) be the central angle of the sector in radians.
   - The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{sector, large}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
     \]
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{sector, small}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
     \]
   - The shaded area is:
      \[
     \text{Shaded Area} = 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
     \]

6. **Set up the equation for the shaded area:**
   - We have:
     \[
     \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

7. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3}
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9}
     \]

8. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   - Recall that \(1\) radian is approximately \(57.3^\circ\):

"To determine how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical glasses and the spherical tank, and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one glass.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical glass. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \)  is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{864}{3} \pi = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical glass:
\[ \text{Number of glasses} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical glasses needed to fill the spherical tank is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]```

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity  \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2 } + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = 0.2\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Next, we multiply these two results together:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} -  The final answer is  \boxed{0.2}","[0.200000000000000, '0.2']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",False
"To determine the speed of the se pinker in inches per second, we need to convert the given speed from kilometers per minute to inches per second. Let's go through the conversion step by step.

1. **Convert kilometers per minute to kilometers per second:**
   Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the speed in kilometers per minute by 60.
   \[
   20 \text{ km/min} \div 60 \text{ s/min} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ km/s} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ km/s}
   \]

2. **Convert kilometers to inches:**
   There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 39.37 inches in a meter. Therefore, there are \(1000 \times 39.37 = 39370\) inches in a kilometer. So, we multiply the speed in kilometers per second by 39370 to convert it to inches per second.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ km/s} \times 39370 \text{ in/km } = \frac{39370}{3} \text{ in/s} = 13123.3333 \text{ in/s}

3. **Round to the nearest whole number:**
   Since the problem does not specify to round to a certain number of decimal places, we can leave the answer in its exact form. However, if we need to round to the nearest whole number, we get:
   \[

"To determine the number of subsets of 5 members that can be formed from a group of 8 members from one partie and 6 members from another partie, we need to consider different cases based on the number of members selected from each partie. The possible cases are:

1. Selecting 0 members from the first partie and 5 members from the second partie.
2. Selecting 1 member from the first partie and 4 members from the second partie.
3. Selecting 2 members from the first partie and 3 members from the second partie.
4. Selecting 3 members from the first partie and 2 members from the second partie.
5. Selecting 4 members from the first partie and 1 member from the second partie.
6. Selecting 5 members from the first partie and 0 members from the second partie.

The number of ways to choose \( k \) members from \( n \) members is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \). Therefore, we can calculate each case as follows:

1. Selecting 0 members from the first partie and 5 members from the second partie:
    \[
   \binom{8}{0} \times \binom{6}{5} = 1 \times 6 = 6
   \]

2. Selecting 1 member from the first part and 4 members from the second part:
   \[
   \binom{8}{1} \times \binom{6}{4} = 8 \times 15 = 120
   \]

3. Selecting 2 members from the first part and 3 members from the second part:
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} \times \binom{6}{3} = 28 \times 20 = 560
   \]

4. Selecting 3 members from the first part and 2 members from the second part:
   \[
   \binom{8}{3} \times \binom{6}{2} = 56 \times 15 = 840
   \]

5. Selecting 4 members from the first part and 1 member from the second part:
   \[
   \binom{8}{4} \times \binom{6}{1}  = 70 \times 6 = 420
   \]

6. Selecting 5 members from the first part and 0 members from the second part:
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} \times \binom{6}{0} = 56 \times 1 = 56
   \]

Now, we sum all these possibilities to get the total number of ways to form the subset:
\[
6 + 120 + 560 + 840 + 420 + 56 = 2002

Thus, the total number of subsets of 5 members that can be formed is:

"To determine the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the greatest of the six rational numbers whose product is 120 and whose average is 24. Let's denote the six rational numbers by \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5,\) and \(a_6\).

First, we know that the product of these six numbers is 120:
\[
a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot a_4 \cdot a_5 \cdot a_6 = 120
\]

Second, we know that the average of these six numbers is 24. Therefore, the sum of these six numbers is:
\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6}{6} = 24 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 144
\]

We need to find the greatest of these six numbers. To do this, we will assume that five of the numbers are as small as possible, and the sixth number will be the greatest.  Let's assume that five of the numbers are equal to 1 (since 1 is a simple and easy-to-b蜀 number):
\[
a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = 1
\]
Then the product of these five numbers is:
\[
1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]
So the sixth number must be:
\[
a_6 = \frac{120}{1} = 120
\]
We also need to check if the sum of these six numbers is 144:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 120 = 125
\]
Since 125 is not equal to 144, our assumption that five of the numbers are 1 is incorrect. Instead, let's try assuming that four of the numbers are 1 and the other two numbers are \(x\) and \(y\):
\[
a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = 1, \quad a_5 = x, \quad a_6 = y
 \]
Then the product of these four numbers is:
\[
1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]
So the product of \(x\) and \(y\) must be:
\[
x \cdot y = \frac{120}{1} = 120
\]
And the sum of these six numbers must be 144:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + x + y = 144 \implies x + y = 140
\]
We now have a system of equations:
\[
x \cdot y = 120
\]
\[
x + y = 140
\]
We can solve this system by treating it as a quadratic equation. If we let \(x\) and \(y\) be the roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0\), we get:
\[
t^2 - 140t + 120 = 0

1. **Isolate the cube root:**
   The equation is already in the form \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides:**
   To remove the cube root, we cube both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3

3. **Calculate \(16^3\):**
   \[
   16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16
   \]
   First, calculate \(16 \times 16\):
   \[
   16 \times 16 = 256
   \]
   Then, multiply by 16 again :
   \[
   256 \times 16 = 4096
   \]
   So, \(16^3 = 4096\).

4. **Set the equation to zero:**
   Now, substitute \(4096\) for \(16^3\) in the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]
   Subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

5. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   The quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\) can be solved using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\ ).

6. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)
   \]
   \[
   \Delta = 16 + 16368

   \[
   \Delta = 16384

7. **Find the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2 \cdot 1}

   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), and point \( D \) is on \( AM \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to determine the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( AM \) is the altitude, \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) and \( AM \perp BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then, \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}. \]

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

 Now, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). We can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \) and \( \triangle BDA \) to find a relationship between the sides and angles.

First, consider \( \triangle BDA \):
\[ \angle BDA = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta. \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDA \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AD}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{10}{\sin 3\theta}. \]

Since \( \sin (180^\circ - 3\theta) = \sin 3\theta \), we have:
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{10}{\sin 3\theta}. \]

Using the triple angle formula for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \), we get:
\[ BD = \frac{10 \ sin \theta}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{10}{3 - 4\sin^2 \theta}. \]

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BD}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{BD}{\cos \theta}. \]

Since \( BC = 2x \), we have:

"To determine the median of 27 positive integers whose product is \(3^7\), we start by considering the properties of the integers and their product.

First, note that the product of 27 positive integers is \(3^7\). Since the product is a power of 3, each of the 27 integers must be a power of 3. Let's denote these integers as \(3^{a_1}, 3^{a_2}, \ldots, 3^{a_{27}}\), where \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{27}\) are non-negative integers. The product of these integers can be written as:
\[3^{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{27}} = 3^7.\]
This implies that:
\[a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{27} = 7.\]
The median of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. To find the median, we need to determine the value of the 14th number in the ordered list of \(3^{a_1},  3^{a_2}, \ldots, 3^{a_{27}}\).

Since the sum of the exponents is 7, the possible values for the exponents are non-negative integers that add up to 7. The smallest possible value for the exponent of the 14th number is 0, and the largest possible value is 1, because if any of the exponents were 2 or more, the sum of the exponents would be greater than 7. Therefore, the 14th number in the ordered list must be \(3^1 = 3\).

Thus, the median of the 27 positive integers whose product is \(3^7\) is \(\boxed{3}\).``````

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the given inequality.

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4) \]

### Step 1: Analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\)

1. **Non-negativity**: Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), and \(x^2 + 4 \geq 4\) for all real \(x\), it follows that:
   \[ x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \]

2. **Minimum value**: The minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) occurs when \(x = 0\):
   \[ x^4 + 4x^2 = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0 \]

 ### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(0 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

#### Lower bound: \(0 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) and it equals 0 only when \(x = 0\), we need:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 > 0 \]
This is true for all \(x \neq 0\).

#### Upper bound: \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

We need to solve the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

### Step 3: Solve the quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\)

First, solve the corresponding quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

 Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard \(y = -7\). Thus, the quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) has the solution:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

### The final answer is  obtained by converting back to \(x\):

Since \(y = x^2\), we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

This implies:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the values of \(x\) that satisfy the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) are:

"Given the equations:
\[ xyz = 4, \]
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4, \]
\[ xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12, \]
we need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx). \]
Substituting the given values into this identity, we get:
\[ 4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx), \]
which simplifies to:
\[ -8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx). \]
We also know that:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). \ ]
Let \( s = x + y + z \) and \( p = xy + yz + zx \). Then:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p. \]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[ -8 = s(s^2 - 3p). \]
Next, we use the second given equation:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4. \]
Recall the identity:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx). \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 4 - 3 \cdot 4 = s(s^2 - 3p), \]
which simplifies to:
\[ -8 = s(s^2 - 3p). \]
This is consistent with our previous equation, so we move on to the third given equation:
\[ xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12. \]
 This can be rewritten as:
\[ xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12. \]
Using \( s = x + y + z \), we get:
\[ xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12. \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ s p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12, \]
or:
\[ sp - 12 = 12, \]
or:
\[ sp = 24. \]
Since we already have \( -8 = s(s^2 - 3p) \), we substitute \( p = \frac{24}{s} \) into this equation:
\[ -8 = s \left( s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s} \right), \]
which simplifies to:
\[ -8 = s^3 - 72, \]
or:
\[ s^3 = 64, \]
or:
\[ s = 4. \]
Thus The final answer is :
\[ p = \frac{24}{4} = 6. \]
So the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step-by-step.

First, let's rewrite the numerator and the denominator:
The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\).
The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality then becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

For the fraction to be negative, the numerator and the denominator must have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\), and positive otherwise). Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) must be negative for the fraction to be negative.

We need to determine where \(x(x-36) < 0\). This inequality holds when \(x\) is between 0 and 36,  i.e., \(0 < x < 36\).

However, we must exclude the points where the numerator is zero because the expression is undefined at those points. So, we exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the solution set. Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36, \text{ and } x \neq 9.\]

In interval notation, this is written as:
\((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

"To determine the largest possible length of the track of the swimming pool, we need to analyze the given shape and its dimensions. The shape consists of a rectangle with a semicircle on each of its longer sides.

Given:
- The total perimeter of the pool is 400 meters.
- The shape has two rectangular sides and two semicircular sides.

Let's denote:
- The width of the rectangle by \( w \).
- The length of the rectangle by \( l \).

The perimeter of the pool includes:
1. The lengths of the two longer sides of the rectangle.
2. The circumferences of the two semicircles.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of the longer sides
The two longer sides of the rectangle contribute to the perimeter. Since there are two longer sides:
\[ 2l \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the semicircular sides
Each semicircle has a diameter equal to the width \( w \) of the rectangle. The circumference of a full circle with diameter \( w \) is \( \pi w \). Since there are two semicircles, the total length of the semicircular sides is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \ pi w = \pi w \]

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total perimeter
The total perimeter of the pool is the sum of the lengths of the longer sides and the circumferences of the semicircles:
\[ 2l + \pi w = 400 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( l \) in terms of \( w \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( l \):
\[ 2l = 400 - \pi w \]
\[ l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \]

### Step 5: Determine the largest possible length \( l \)
To maximize \( l \), we need to minimize \( w \). The minimum value of \( w \) is 0, but in practical terms, \( w \) must be a positive value. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can consider the theoretical maximum length when \( w \) is as small as possible.

### Step 6: Calculate the maximum length \( l \) when \( w \) is very small
As \( w \) approaches 0, the perimeter equation simplifies to:
\[ 2l \approx 400  \]
\[ l \approx 200 \]

Thus, as \( w \) approaches 0, the length \( l \) approaches 200 meters. However, in practical terms, \( w \) cannot be zero, but it can be very small.

### Final Answer
Given the constraints and practical considerations, the largest possible length of the track of the swimming pool is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\] meters. This is the maximum length when the width \( w \) is minimized to a practical value. However, if we strictly follow the given problem without additional constraints, the theoretical maximum length is 200 meters. Therefore, the largest possible length of the track of the swimming pool is \(\boxed{200}\) meters. However, in practical terms, the width must be a positive value, and the length will be slightly less than 200 meters. The maximum length in practical terms would be the length when \( w \) is minimized but not zero. The theoretical maximum length, as calculated, is 200 meters. Therefore, the largest possible length of the track of the swimming pool is \(\boxed{200}\) meters.","[200, '200']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) in \(\triangle RST\), and knowing that \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary (since \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)), we can use the properties of complementary angles to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, recall that for complementary angles \(A\) and \(B\), \(\sin{A} = \cos{B}\) and \(\cos{A} = \sin{B}\). Since \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R}
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos{R}\). We know that \(\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1\). Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{4}{25} + \cos^2{R} = 1 
\]
Subtract \(\frac{4}{25}\) from both sides:
\[
\cos^2{R} = 1 - \frac{4}{25}
\]
Convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{25}{25} - \frac{4}{25}
\]
\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{21}{25}
\]
Taking the positive square root (since \(\cos{R}\) is positive in a right triangle with \(\angle R\) being acute):
\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

The value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).```

The function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) is a parabola that opens upwards with its vertex at \( x = 0 \). At the vertex, the value of \( y \) is:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 0^2 - 3 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -3 \right) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}. \]

As \( x \) moves away from 0, the value of \( y \) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \( y \) is \( \left[ -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, \infty \right) \).

 The smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number less than or equal to any value in the range of \( y \) is 2. Therefore, the largest integer between the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on the graph is 2.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
    \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us two solutions: \( x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1 \) and \( x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.

 Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0.

First, let's understand the structure of the regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be thought of as being arranged such that they form two pyramids joined at their bases, with the base being a square.

We can place the vertices of the octahedron in a coordinate system. Let's assume the vertices are at:
\[
(1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, -1)

Given the distances from \( P \) to five of these vertices, we need to find the sixth distance. Let's denote the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \ ).

The distances from \( P \) to the vertices \((1, 0, 0)\), \((-1, 0, 0)\), \((0, 1, 0)\), \((0, -1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, 1)\) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the mass of the ball and the mass of the baseball, as described by the formula for the volume of a sphere (since the mass of a sphere is proportional to the volume, and the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius).

Given:
- Mass of the softball ball (\(m_{\text{softball}}\)) = 200 g
- Mass of the baseball (\(m_{\text{baseball}}\)) = 150 g

We are told that the mass of the softball ball is proportional to the cube of its radius, and the mass of the baseball is proportional to the cube of its radius. Therefore, we can set up the following relationship:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{softball}}}{R_{\text{baseball}}}\right)^3 = \frac{m_{\text{softball}}}{m_{\text{baseball}}}
\]

Substituting the given masses:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{softball}}}{R_{\text{baseball}}}\right)^3 = \frac{200}{150 } = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Taking the cube root of both sides:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{softball}}}{R_{\text{baseball}}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{3}}
\]

This tells us that the radius of the softball ball is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{3}}\) times the radius of the baseball. Since the mass of an object is proportional to the cube of its radius, the mass of the softball ball is \(\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{3}}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\) times the mass of the baseball.

Therefore, the mass of the baseball is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the mass of the softball ball. In other words, the baseball is \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as heavy as the softball ball.

Thus, the mass of the baseball is:

\[
m_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{3}{4} \times m_{\text{softball}} = \frac{3}{4} \times 200 = 150 \text{ g}
\ ]

So, the mass of the baseball is the same as the mass of the baseball that Jack is le president of, which is 150 g.

Therefore, the mass of the baseball that Jack is le president of is \(\boxed{150}\).```

    To convert \( 629_{10} \) to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and record the remainders.

    \[
    629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
    \]
    \[
    89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

    \]

    Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get:
    \[
    629_{10} = 1556_{7}
    \]

2. ** convert \( 629_{10} \) to base 8:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of children who received candy in the forest where only children who are not together get candy. We'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the children and their relationships:**
   - We have two groups of children: children who are together and children who are not together.
   - Children who are not together get candy.
   - Children who are together do not get candy unless they are all together.

2. **Analyze the given information:**
   - For every pair of children who represent a group of children who are not together, there is exactly one child who is not in that group and who is not in any other group of children who are not together.
   - This implies that the children are divided into groups of 3, where each group of 3 children does not get candy, and the remaining children get candy.

3. **Determine the number of groups of 3:**
   - Let's assume there are \( n \) children in total.
   - If we group the children into groups of 3, each group of 3 children does not get candy.
   - The number of groups of 3 can be calculated as \( \frac{n}{ 3} \).

4. **Calculate the number of children who get candy:**
   - The number of children who do not get candy is \( \frac{n}{3} \).
   - Therefore, the number of children who get candy is \( n - \frac{n}{3} = \frac{2n}{3} \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of children who get candy is \( \frac{2n}{3} \).

Since the problem does not specify the total number of children, we can only express the number of children who get candy in terms of \( n \).

\[
\boxed{\frac{2n}{3}}
\]

If we assume a specific number of children, we can substitute that value for \( n \) to get a numerical answer. For example, if there are 12 children, then the number of children who get candy is:

\[
\frac{2 \times 12}{3} = 8
\]

So, the number of children who get candy is \(\boxed{8}\). However, without a specific number of children, the general answer is \(\boxed{\frac{2n}{3}}\).","[(2*n)/3, '\\frac{2n}{3}']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to understand that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). This is because substituting \( x = 1 \) into the polynomial effectively sums all the coefficients.

Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) will be \( g(1) \). By the definition of \( g(x) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line in standard form.

First, we need to rewrite the line equation \(y = 2x - 2\) in standard form. The standard form is \(Ax + By + C = 0\).

Starting with \(y = 2x - 2\), we can rearrange it as follows:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Next, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula. So, \(x_1 = 6\) and \(y_1 = 0\ ).

Now, we plug these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10|\), which is 10.

Next, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, we have:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

"To determine the cost of one pensac and onejumbo pen, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pensac.
- Let \( j \) be the cost of onejumbo pen.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( p + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( p + j = 1.82 \)

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement because the same equation cannot hold true for different total costs. Let's re-evaluate the problem by assuming the total costs provided are for different quantities of pens.

Let's assumeInstead:
- T三 pen total pensac cost and onejumbo pen \$1.24.
- Lasya pensac cost and onejumbo pen \$1.82.

We can set up the equations as follows:
1. \( p_1 + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( p_2 + j = 1.82 \)

To find the cost of one pensac, we need to eliminate \( j \). Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (p_2 + j) - (p_1 +  j) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ p_2 - p_1 = 0.58 \]

This tells us that the difference in the cost of one pensac between T三 and Lasya is \$0.58. However, without additional information, we cannot determine the individual costs of \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \).

Given the problem statement, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that T三 and Lasya each bought one pensac and onejumbo pen, and the total costs provided are for the same type of pens.

Let's reframe the problem with a single equation that accounts for both pens:
\[ p + j = 1.24 \]
\[ p + j = 1.82 \]

Again, this is not possible. Therefore, we must assume the problem intended to provide a consistent system of equations. Let's correct the problem to a solvable form:

1. T三 pensac and onejumbo pen \$1.24.
2. Lasya pensac and onejumbo pen \$1.82.

Assume the correct interpretation:
\[ 3p +  j = 1.24 \]
\[ 2p + j = 1.82 \]

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (3p + j) - (2p + j) = 1.24 - 1.82 \]
\[ p = -0.58 \]

This is not possible as the cost cannot be negative. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be different.

Given the problem's constraints, let's assume the correct interpretation is:
1. T三 pensac and onejumbo pen \$1.24.
2. Lasya pensac and onejumbo pen \$1.82.

Assume the correct interpretation:
\[ 2p + j = 1.24 \]
\[ 3p + j = 1.82 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (3p + j) - (2p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ p = 0.58 \]

Thus, the cost of one pensac is \(\boxed{0.58}\).```

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's do this step by step.

1. First, we set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, we know the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\ldots\) and proceed with the division.

Let's perform the long division:

- 500 goes into 1370 (we add a decimal point and a 0) 2 times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write 2 after the decimal point.
- Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 3700. Now, 500 goes into 3700 7 times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). So, we write 7 after the 2.
 - Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 2000. Now, 500 goes into 2000 4 times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write 4 after the 7.
- Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

The digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) are 2, 7, and 4. The last digit is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

- \(A = (-a, a)\)
- \(B = (a, a)\)
- \(C = (a, -a)\)
- \(D = (-a, -a)\)
- The center \(O\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:

We need to find the region within the rectangle where:
\[

Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition:

"To determine how many more k  

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the rectangular sign and the area of the sign placed diagonally. We will then compare the two areas to find out how much more area Martha's sign covers compared to Jim's sign.

1. **Calculate the area of Jim's sign:**
   - Jim's sign is a rectangle with a length of 400 k  

2. **Calculate the area of Martha's sign:**
   - Martha's sign is a diagonal across the same rectangle. To find the area of a diagonal, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal and then calculate the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal and the sides of the rectangle.

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - Let \( d \) be the length of the diagonal.
   \[
   d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
   \]
    \[
   d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000}
   \]
   \[
   d = \sqrt{250000}
   \]
   \[
   d = 500 \text{ k  

4. **Calculate the area of Martha's triangle:**
   - The area of a triangle is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   - Here, the base is 300 k  

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 \times 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = 60000 \text{ k  

6. **Find the difference in area:**
   - Subtract the area of Jim's sign from the area of Martha's sign:
   \[
    \text{Difference} = 60000 - 120000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20000 \text{ k  

Therefore, Martha's sign covers \(\boxed{20000}\) more k  

This step-by-step solution shows that Martha's sign covers 20,000 square k  

The final answer is \(\boxed{20000}\) k

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. This means that \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). Additionally, the sum of the cube roots of unity is zero, so we have \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies that \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Since \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\), we can substitute this into the numerator:

 \[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + \omega + (-1 - \omega) = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). We expand this product:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]

Again, using the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To determine the maximum distance Ber Pole can j卧 from if he Midases from Titik A, B, C, or D, and-card three Titik之一, we need to calculate the distances between each pair of points and then find the maximum distance.

First, let's list the coordinates of the points:
- \( A = (-3, 3) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

We will use the distance formula to calculate the distances between each pair of points. The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

### Calculating Distances

1. **Distance \( AB \):**
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{(3 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2}  = \sqrt{36 + 9} = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
   \]

2. **Distance \( AC \):**
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (-4 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(0 + 3)^2 + (-7)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-7)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 49} = \sqrt{58}
   \]

3. **Distance \( AD \):**
   \[
   AD = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(0 + 3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
   \]

4. **Distance \( BC \):**
   \[
   BC = \sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16}  = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]

5. **Distance \( BD \):**
   \[
   BD = \sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

6. **Distance \( CD \):**
   \[
   CD = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16} = 4
   \]

### Finding the Maximum Distance

Now, we compare all the calculated distances:
- \( AB = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7 \)
- \( AC = \sqrt{58} \approx 7.6 \)
- \( AD = 3\sqrt{2} \approx 4.2 \)
- \( BC = 5 \)
- \( BD = 3 \)
- \( CD = 4 \)

The maximum distance among these values is \( \sqrt{58} \).
