"To determine the value of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\), we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(D\):
   - \(EF\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\).
   - \(DF\) is the adjacent side to angle \(D\).
   - \(DE\) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

2. Recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DE}
   \]
   Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the equation:
   \[
   0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
   \]

3. Solve for \(DE\):
   \[
   DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

Therefore, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).

"To find \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z \) around the complex number \( c \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in the counterclockwise direction. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in terms of their real and imaginary parts:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Calculate the vector from \( c \) to \( z \):**
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (- (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3))i = \sqrt{2} - (3\sqrt{2})i
   \]

3. **Express the vector \( z - c \) in polar form:**
   The magnitude \( r \) of \( z - c \) is:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
   \]
   The argument \( \theta \) of \( z - c \) is:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \tan^{-1}(-3)
   \]
   So, \( z - c = 2\sqrt{5} \text{cis}(\tan^{-1}(-3)) \).

4. **Rotate the vector \( z - c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\):**
   The new vector after rotation is:
   \[
   2\sqrt{5} \text{cis}\left(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]
   Converting back to rectangular form, we get:
   \[
   2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos\left(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}\ right) \right)
   \]

5. **Add this rotated vector to \( c \) to get \( w \):**
   \[
   w = c + 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos\left(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]

To simplify, we can use the fact that rotating a complex number \( a + bi \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is equivalent to multiplying it by \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \):
\[
w = c + (z - c) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can't divide anymore.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5 . We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 7. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857,\]
which is not an integer, so 121 is not divisible by 7. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 11. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 = 2 \times 11^2.\]

Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

"To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 questions around a round table, considering that 3 specific questions (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) need to be together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3 questions (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single ""block"":**
   Since these 3 questions must be together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""items"" (the block and the other 5 questions) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""items"" around the round table:**
   The number of distinct ways to arrange \( n \) items around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""items"" around a round table is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the 3 questions within the block:**
   Within the block, the 3 questions (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways:
   \[
   3! = 6
    \]

4. **Combine the arrangements:**
   To find the total number of distinct arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""items"" by the number of ways to arrange the 3 questions within the block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the total number of distinct ways to arrange 8 questions around a round table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are together, is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term). Let's simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

\ [
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2 }\right)^3 x^{15 - 5 \cdot 3}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[

\[

"Un pentagone�ite t given a center of rotation. To determine the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be turned until it coincides with its starting position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center by certain angles and still look the same. The angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself is given by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \), where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \), so the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that the pentagon looks the same after being rotated by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full 360 degrees (which is equivalent to 0 degrees, i.e., no rotation at all).

The minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be turned to coincide with its starting position is therefore 72 degrees.

Thus, the answer is:

"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\).

First, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \ right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints of \(AC\) and \(BD\) are the same:
\[
\left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
6 = \frac{6 + x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{7}{2} = \frac{8 + y}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 = \frac{6 + x}{2} \implies 12 = 6 + x \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{7}{2} = \frac{8 + y}{2} \implies 7 = 8 + y \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5
 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\).```

"为了找到函数 \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) 的垂直和水平渐近线，我们需要分析分母和分子。

### 第1步：找到垂直渐近线
垂直渐近线出现在分母为零的地方，但分子不为零。因此，我们需要解方程：
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
这个二次方程可以分解为：
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
因此，解为：
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{和} \quad x = -2. \]
我们需要检查这些值是否使分子为零。分子是 \( 2x \)，它在 \( x = 0 \) 时为零。因此，\( x = 7 \) 和 \( x = -2 \) 都是垂直渐近线。所以，\( a = 7 \) 和 \( b = -2 \)。

### 第2步：找到水平渐近线
水平渐近线由函数在 \( x \) 趋向于无穷大时的行为决定。 为了找到它，我们查看分子和分母的次数。分子的次数为1，分母的次数为2。由于分子的次数小于分母的次数，水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。所以，\( c = 0 \)。

### 第3步：计算 \( a + b + c \)
我们有 \( a = 7 \)，\( b = -2 \)，和 \( c = 0 \)。因此，
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|,
\]

we first need to understand the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm (or the norm of a matrix) is defined as the maximum value of the ratio of the norm of the output to the norm of the input vector, i.e.,

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}} \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}.
\]

We can use the fact that the operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is equal to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \). For  the matrix \( A \),

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

and

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0,
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. So we have

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.

 Solving this quadratic equation, we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 16 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue, which is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Therefore, the smallest real number \( C \) such that

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \), \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \),  and so on. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{-1}. \]```


This is the final answer. The value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).```

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) and \(18_9\) to base 10

#### Convert \(58_9\) to base 10:
The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

#### Convert \(18_9\) to base 10:
The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\]

### Step 2:  Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the two base 10 numbers:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

### Step 3: Convert the result back to base 9
To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients for the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36, which is \(9^1 = 9\).

#### Determine the coefficient for \(9^1\):
\[36 \div 9 = 4\]
So, the coefficient for \(9^1\) is 4. This means we have \(4 \cdot 9^1 = 36\), and there is no remainder. Therefore, the coefficient for \(9^0\) is 0.

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant and sine functions in terms of sine and cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator here is \(\cos x \sin x\). So we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So we substitute this in :

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

This is the definition of the cotangent function, so we have:

\[
\cot x

Thus, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of treeks that are equivalent to one squig. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( T \) represent one treek.
   - Let \( S \) represent one squig.
   - Let \( G \) represent one goolee.

2. **Translate the given information into equations:**
   - ""Dix treeks pensesant que three squigs et un goolee"" translates to:
     \[
     10T = 3S + G
     \]
   - ""Deux treeks et un goolee sont égaux en数 de treeks que un squig"" translates to:
     \[
     2T + G = S
     \]

3. **Express \( G \) in terms of \( T \) and \( S \):**
   From the second equation:
   \[
   G = S - 2T
   \]

4. **Substitute \( G \) into the first equation:**
   Substitute \( G = S - 2T \) into \( 10T = 3S + G \):
    \[
   10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   10T = 4S - 2T
   \]

5. **Solve for \( S \) in terms of \( T \):**
   Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
   \[
   12T = 4S
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   3T = S
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   S = 3T
   \]

6. **Determine the number of treeks equivalent to one squig:**
   Since \( S = 3T \), one squig is equivalent to 3 treeks.

Thus, the number of treeks that are equivalent to one squig is \(\boxed{3}\).```

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the polynomials, we start by multiplying the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) and comparing the result to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, let's expand the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2  + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare this to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By matching the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:
1. The coefficient of \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\) (This is already satisfied.)
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. The coefficient of \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. The constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation, we solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6  \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we can verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into the other equations. First, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct. Now, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is also correct. Therefore, the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct.

The value of \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).```

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to find the volume of the tank that corresponds to the given rate of filling and the change in height. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Here, the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per color, and the height of the water increases by 4 meters per color. This means that the volume of water added per color is equal to the volume of a cylinder with height 4 meters and radius \( r \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 20\pi \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 4r^2 = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is:

\[  \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \] meters.```

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the function \( f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function and its graph.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \( x \geq a \)
For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). At \( x = a \), the value of the function is \( f(a) = a^3 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \( x < a \)
For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \). As \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left , the value of the function approaches \( f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a \).

### Step 3: Ensure the function is continuous at \( x = a \)
For the function to be continuous at \( x = a \), we need:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a).
\]
This means:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]
Factoring out \( a \), we get:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]
Further factoring the quadratic, we get:
\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( a = -1 \). Since \( a = 0 \) would make the function constant and not intersect each horizontal line at least once, we discard it. Therefore, the possible values of \( a \) are \( 2 \) and \( -1 \).

###  Step 4: Determine the largest value of \( a \)
The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition is \( a = 2 \).

Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at least once is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]```Python

### Conclusion:
The largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \( \boxed{2} \). This value ensures that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous and intersects each horizontal line at least once. The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function that changes from a linear part to a quadratic part at \( x = a \). The continuity condition at \( x = a \) is satisfied by solving the equation \( a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0 \), which gives the solutions \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( a = -1 \). Since \( a = 0 \) does not allow the graph to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the largest value of \( a \) is","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given circle equation has a radius of length 1, we will follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the given equation in standard form:**
   The given equation is:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
   \]

2. **Complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and \( y \)-terms:**
   - For the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \)
     \[
     x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \)
     \[
     y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9
     \]

3. **Substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:**
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
   \]

4. **Combine the constant terms and simplify:**
   \ [
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
   \]
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]

5. **Identify the standard form of the circle equation:**
   The standard form of a circle's equation is:
   \[
   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
   \]
   where \((h, k)\) is the center and \( r \) is the radius.

6. **Compare with the standard form:**
   From our equation:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]
   we see that the radius squared \( r^2 \) is:
   \[
   r^2 = 34 - c
   \]

7. **Set the radius squared equal to 1 (since we want the radius to be 1):**
   \[
   34 - c = 1
   \]

8. **Solve for \( c \):**
    \[
   34 - 1 = c
   \]
   \[
   c = 33

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of length 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda,
\]
which is always true for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is trivial. For  \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so let's check if there are other solutions. If we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \lambda \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2\right) = 1,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - (\lambda - 1) + (\lambda - 1)^2\right) = 1,

\lambda (1 - \lambda + 1 + \lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) = 1,

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Using the angle addition formulas, we know that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B) \quad \text{ and} \quad \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) - \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ - \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ -  \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Again, using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now we substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

"1. **Determine the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):**

   To find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\), we use the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
   \]
   Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\).

   - Calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

   Since higher powers of 5 will result in even smaller fractions, we stop here.

   - Sum the results:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the form of the function and possible values for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, observe that if \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \cos \phi \) for some angles \( \theta \) and \( \phi \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sin \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sin \phi \). This transforms the function into:
\[ f(x, y) = \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta. \]
Using the angle addition formula for sine, we get:
\[ f(x, y) = \sin(\theta + \phi). \]
The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any  integer \( k \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

To verify, we can check specific values. For example, if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), then:
\[ f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1. \]
Similarly, if \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \), then:
\[ f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1. \]
These examples confirm that the maximum value of the function is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) where \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) and then divide it by 2.

First, let's compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3  \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix}
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \mathbf{j} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} + \mathbf{k} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -2  \end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating each of these 2x2 determinants:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = (2 \cdot 1) - (3 \cdot -2) = 2 + 6 = 8
\]
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = (1 \cdot 1) - (3 \cdot -3) = 1 + 9 = 10
\]
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = (1 \cdot -2) - (2 \cdot -3) = -2 + 6 = 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4 = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number satisfying the quadratic equation derived from the given condition. Specifically, if we let \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos \theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \implies \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The number \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is the real part of the golden ratio \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) divided by 2. This corresponds to the real part of the complex number \( e^{i \theta} \) where \( \theta = \pm \arccos \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).  If \( z = e^{i \theta} \), then \( z^{85} = e^{i 85 \theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i 85 \theta} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i 85 \theta} + e^{-i 85 \theta} = 2 \cos (85 \theta). \]

We need to determine \( \cos (85 \theta) \). Note that \( \theta = \arccos \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) \) implies that \( \cos (85 \theta) \) can be found using the properties of the golden ratio. The golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). The reciprocal of \( \phi \) is \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2 (1  - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \). This means that \( \cos (85 \theta) \) can be shown to be \( \cos (85 \arccos(\phi/2)) \), which simplifies to \( \pm 1 \) due to the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function.

Thus, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos (85 \theta) = 2 \cdot (-1) = -2. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given that the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) of triangle \(ABC\) intersect at the centroid \(G\), and the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\) respectively, we need to find the area of triangle \( combination of medians and centroid properties in a triangle.

1. **Understanding the Centroid:**
   The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being towards the vertex. This means \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Line Parallel to \(BC\):**
   The line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by AA similarity (both share angle \(A\) and have corresponding angles equal because of the parallel lines).

3. **Similarity Ratio:**
   The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the  ratio of the distances from the vertex to the corresponding points on the sides. Since \(G\) divides the median in the ratio 2:1, the distance from \(A\) to \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to the midpoint of \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio between triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

4. **Area Ratio:**
   The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

5. **Area of \(AMN\):**
   Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } AMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16
   \]

6. **Area of \(组合三角形 \(ABC\) 和 \(AMN\) 的差:**
   The area of  the quadrilateral \(BMNC\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):
   \[
   \text{Area of } BMNC = 144 - 16 = 128
   \]

7. **Area of \( combination of triangles \(W, I, 和 \(I\) 的面积:**
   Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. The area of triangle \(W的情况下 is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\):
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle W = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48

8. **Conclusion:**
   The area of triangle \(W\) is \(\boxed{16}\). This is the area of the triangle formed by the centroid and the points where the line parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\). The final answer is: \(\boxed{16}\). \(\)  \(\)  \(\)  \(\)  \(\)  \(\)  \(\)  \(\","[16, '16']",8,"[8, '8']",False
" initial number of books is 24, and there are three equities: the last is 8 books of myths, the middle is 10 books of mathematics, and the first is 6 books of science. Two books are removed from each equation.

First, calculate the number of books remaining in each equation after two books are removed from each:

2. Middle equation (10 books of mathematics): \(10 - 2 = 8\) books remain.

"To determine the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first term and the common difference of the sequence.
2. Use the information given to set up equations.
3. Solve these equations to find the first term and the common difference.
4. Use the first term and the common difference to find the sixth term.

Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

We are given that the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term, we can write:
\[a_4 = a + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}\]
\[a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}\]

 To eliminate \(a\), we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find \(a\):
\[a + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = 200 - 225\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have the first term \(a = -25\) and the common difference \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term \(a_6\):
\[a_6 = a + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

First, we note that \( 2^{24} \) can be written as \( (2^a)^n \) where \( a \) and \( n \) are integers. This implies that \( 24 = an \), and thus \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. We need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

"To determine how many nickels Hillary aиков has, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total value of the dimes and nickels is 75 cents.
2. The value of the dimes and nickels combined is 75 cents.

The value of the dimes is \( 10d \) cents (since each dime is worth 10 cents), and the value of the nickels is \( 5n \) cents (since each nickel is worth 5 cents). Therefore, the total value equation is:
\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the number of nickels \( n \) is equal to 15 minus twice the number of dimes \( d \). To find the number of nickels, we need to find a value for \( d \) that makes \( n \) a  non-negative integer. Let's test some values for \( d \):

If \( d = 0 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \]

If \( d = 1 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \]

If \( d = 2 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \]

If \( d = 3 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \]

If \( d = 4 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \]

If \( d = 5 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \]

If \( d = 6 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 6 = 3 \]

If \( d = 7 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 7 = 1 \]

If \( d = 8 \):
\[ n = 15 - 2 \cdot 8 = -1 \] (This is not a  valid solution since the number of nickels cannot be negative.)

So, the possible values for \( n \) are 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1. However, the problem does not specify the number of dimes, so any of these values for \( n \) would be a valid solution depending on the number of dimes. Since the problem does not specify the number of dimes, we can choose one of these values. For simplicity, let's choose the largest possible value for \( n \):

Therefore, the number of nickels Hillary a 배is a sake of simplicity is:

The answer depends on the number of dimes she has. But without additional information, the largest possible number of nickels is 15.

   Paul and Jesse each choose a number from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). Since each person can choose any of the 6 numbers independently, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Determine the condition for the sum to be even:**
   The sum of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

3. **Count the number of even and odd numbers in the set:**
   - Even numbers: \(2, 4, 6\) (3 numbers)
   - Odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5\) (3 numbers)

4. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - Both numbers chosen are even: There are 3 choices for the first person and 3 choices for the second person, giving:
     \[
     3 \times 3 = 9
     \]
   - Both numbers chosen are odd: Similarly, there are 3 choices for the first person and 3 choices for the second  person, giving:
     \[

   - Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes (both numbers even or both numbers odd) is:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\). This means that the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\frac{1}{2}\). This is because there are an equal number of ways to choose two even numbers and two odd numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), making the probability of the sum being even exactly half of the total number of possible outcomes.","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the areas of the two rectangles and then subtract the area of the overlapping region (the shaded triangle).

First, let's calculate the area of the larger rectangle. The larger rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. Therefore, its area is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the smaller rectangle. The smaller rectangle has a width of 2 units and a height of 4 units. Therefore, its area is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ square units}
\]

Now, we need to find the area of the overlapping region, which is a right triangle. The base of the triangle is 2 units (the width of the smaller rectangle) and the height of the triangle is 4 units (the height of both rectangles). The area of a triangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
So, the area of the overlapping triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \ times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles minus the area of the overlapping triangle:
\[
12 + 8 - 4 = 16 \text{ square units}

Thus, the total area of the shaded region is:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we start by noting that 450 can be factored into prime factors as follows:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

This means that any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Divisibility by 2 requires the number to end in an even digit, but since we are only allowed to use the digits 0 and 1, the number must end in 0. Divisibility by 25 requires the last two digits to be 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since we can only use 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00. Divisibility by 9 requires the sum of the digits to be a multiple of 9. Since the only digit we can use is 0 or 1, the number must have a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9.

The smallest number that meets these criteria is 11111111100. This number ends in 00,  so it is divisible by 25. It also has nine 1's, so the sum of the digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9. Finally, it is clearly divisible by 2 because it ends in 0.

To confirm, we can check the divisibility:
- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- The last two digits are 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits is \(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9\), which is a multiple of 9.

Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones is:

\[

The final answer is $\boxed{11111111100}$. This number is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones.

"To determine the probability that the pion is placed on a shaded cell of the checkerboard, we need to analyze the structure of the checkerboard and the conditions given in the problem.

First, let's list the possible remainders for each number:
- The first number is determined by dividing by 4, so the possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3.
- The second number is determined by dividing by 5, so the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

We can represent these remainders as follows:
- For the first number, the possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3.
- For the second number, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

If we plot these on the checkerboard, we can see that the first number corresponds to the columns 1, 2, and 6, and the second number corresponds to the rows 1, 2, 3, and 4. The intersection of these columns and rows gives us the following possible positions:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
- (2,1), (2,2), ( 2,3)
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)

We need to determine which of these positions correspond to the shaded cells. The shaded cells are in the following positions:
- (1,1)
- (2,2)
- (3,3)

From the possible positions, we can see that the shaded cells are (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3). Therefore, out of the 9 possible positions, 3 are shaded.

The probability that the pion is placed on a shaded cell is the number of shaded cells divided by the total number of cells:

"To determine the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to its decimal form.

First, let's rewrite the denominator:
\[
5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2
\]
So the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) to its decimal form. To do this, we divide 4321 by 20000000:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

 The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is 0.00021605. Now, we sum the digits of this decimal:
\[

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).```

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]

This can be written as:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\ [
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of this product, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\), we can use the fact that:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Thus, the product is:

The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (with a negative sign), which is 49. So, if the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \) are the roots of \( g(x ) \). This is because if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( f(r) = 0 \), and thus \( g(r-5) = f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \).

First, recall that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta\) and \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\). Thus, \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ\).

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ\).

Similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ\ ).

Now, we substitute these into the original expression:

This simplifies to:

To find \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\), we use the identity \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\). So, \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\ ).

However, a known result from trigonometry is that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12\). This result can be derived using more complex trigonometric identities or verified through known trigonometric values and identities.

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) to find a solution:

Thus, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check which of these values satisfies the original condition. For \( t = 4 \):

   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \( A \) of one face is given by:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \):
   \[
   A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square unit}
   \]

3. **Determine the total surface area:**
    A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \( T \) is:
   \[
   T = 6 \times A
   \]
   Substituting the area of one face:
   \[
   T = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square units}

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\) square units.```

"To calculate the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\) is \(a - b\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number by its conjugate:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

We use the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:

"1. Let's start by evaluating the expression inside the sine function. We have:
   \[
   \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right)
   \]

2. Recall that:
   \[
   \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)
   \]
   This is because the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent function.

3. Therefore, we can rewrite the given equation as:
   \[
   \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

4. Simplify the argument of the sine function:
   \[
   \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. Use the double-angle identity for sine:
   \[
   \sin (2 \theta) = 2 \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta)
   \]
   where \(\theta = \tan^{-1 } (x)\).

6. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then \(\tan (\theta) = x\). We need to find \(\sin (\theta)\) and \(\cos (\theta)\):
   \[
   \sin (\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
   \]
   \[
   \cos (\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}

7. Substitute these into the double-angle identity:
   \[
   \sin (2 \theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}
   \]

8. Set the expression equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}

9. Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   6x = 1 + x^2

 10. Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form:
    \[
    x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0

11. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
    \[
    x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}

   The \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\), and the \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

2. **Exclude the boundary points:**

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c}.

We can factor out the constants  from each term:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Also, the cross product is anti-commutative, so \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\).

From the table, the number of stamps from the 70's for each country is:

- Peru: 6
- Spain: 9

The cost per stamp for each country is:

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 70's stamps:

- France: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) centimes
- Peru: \(6 \times 5 = 30\) centimes

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of the trapezoid \([ABCD] = 42\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(AB = c\)
- \(CD = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
Let \(AB = c\) and \(CD = d\). Then:
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{b}{d}
\]
This implies:
\[
c \cdot d = a \cdot b
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), triangle \(ACD\) is a right triangle with  \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

To find the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\), we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. We know that:
\[
[ABCD] = 42
\]
So:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Now, we need to express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(d\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\)  of the trapezoid is also the height of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

To find \(d\), we use the fact that the area of the trapezoid can also be expressed in terms of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). Let the area of \(\triangle ABC\) be \(x\). Then:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d + x
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the area of \(\triangle ABD\) minus the area of \(\triangle ACD\). However, we can use the fact that the height of the trapezoid is the same for both triangles, and the bases are \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

   \left( \frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

   Simplifying both sides, we get:

First, we calculate the product of the numerators \( m \) and \( p \):

The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair of points (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

"为了找到角 \( \angle ADC \) 的度数，我们首先分析给定的图形。我们有两个圆，一个中心在 \( D \)，半径为 1（较小的圆），另一个中心在 \( D \)，半径为 2（较大的圆）。要求的面积是omromate的面积，它等于较大圆面积的 \( \frac{5}{12} \)。

首先，我们计算较大圆的面积：
\[
\text{较大圆的面积} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
omromate的面积是这个面积的 \( \frac{5}{12} \)：
\[
\text{omromate的面积} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

\[

\]
小扇形的面积是：
\[
\text{小扇形的面积} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi
\]
omromate的面积是大扇形和小扇形面积之差：
\[
\text{omromate的面积} = \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi = \pi \left( \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \right) = \pi \left( \frac{4\theta - \theta}{360^\circ} \right) = \pi \left( \frac{3\theta}{360^\circ } \right) = \frac{\theta \pi}{120^\circ}
\]
我们知道omromate的面积是 \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \)：
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{120^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
我们可以从等式的两边消去 \( \pi \)：
\[
\frac{\theta}{120^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}

\[
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \times 120^\circ = 200^\circ

"To determine how much woodoshon will need to fill a spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.
2. Determine the volume of one woodoshon.
3. Divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one woodoshon to find the number of woodoshons needed.

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the spherical tank

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

For the spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm:
\[
r = 6 \text{ cm}
\]
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3
\]
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216)
\]
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4 \times 216}{3} \pi
\]
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = 288  \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the volume of one woodoshon

The woodoshon is a cylinder with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

For the woodoshon:
\[
r = 3 \text{ cm}
\]
\[
h = 8 \text{ cm}
\]
\[
V_{\text{woodoshon}} = \pi (3)^2 (8)
\]
\[
V_{\text{woodoshon}} = \pi (9) (8)
\]
\[
V_{\text{woodoshon}} = 72 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

### Step 3: Divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one woodoshon

To find the number of woodoshons needed:
\[
\text{Number of woodoshons} = \frac{V_{\text{tank}}}{V_{\text{woodoshon }}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of woodoshons} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi}
\]
\[
\text{Number of woodoshons} = \frac{288}{72}
\]
\[
\text{Number of woodoshons} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of woodoshons needed to fill the spherical tank is \boxed{4}.```

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos  \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha).
\]
Expanding the product, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \cos \alpha \sin \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Notice that the terms cancel each other out:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \cos \alpha \sin \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.

"To determine how many subgroups of 5 members can be formed from a group of 8 publics and 6 der bunches, such that each subgroup includes at least one public, we can use the principle of complementary counting. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total number of subgroups of 5 members from the entire group of 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of subgroups of 5 members that contain no publics (i.e., all 5 members are der bunches):**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 der bunches is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)! } = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of subgroups of 5 members that include at least one public:**
   This is the total number of subgroups of 5 members minus the number of subgroups of 5 members that contain no publics:
   \[

Therefore, the number of subgroups of 5 members that include at least one public is \(\boxed{1996}\).```

This was calculated by first finding the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14, then subtracting the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 der bunches, which ensures that each subgroup contains at least one public.

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
\]

Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 + 487)(513 - 487)
\]

First, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Next, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 + 487)(513 - 487) = 1000 \times 26
\]

To find \(1000 \times 26\), we can break it down as follows:

 \[
1000 \times 26 = 1000 \times (20 + 6) = 1000 \times 20 + 1000 \times 6 = 20000 + 6000 = 26000

Thus, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

First, let's expand this product:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n
\]

We are given that this product equals 120:

\[
n^3 - n = 120
\]

Next, we need to find an integer \( n \) that satisfies this equation. We can test integer values of \( n \) to find the correct one:

For \( n = 4 \):

\[
4^3 - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60 \quad (\text{too small})
\]

For \( n = 5 \):

\[

Thus, \( n = 5 \) is a solution. The three consecutive integers are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \ ).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) for the positive value of \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\ ]

Now, solve the equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\) for \(x\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(4096 = 64^2\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Thus, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). So the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2:
\[

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\),  we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

Therefore,

First, let's denote the length of \(BC\) as \(2x\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, we have \(BM = MC = x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we get:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\).

Next, consider the angles. Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).  We can use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle ABD\) to relate the angles and sides.

In \(\triangle BCD\), we have:
\[
\angle BDC = 3\theta, \quad \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}.
\]
In \(\triangle ABD\), we have:
\[
\angle ABD = \angle ACD = \frac{\angle BAC}{2} = \frac{\theta}{2}, \quad \angle ADB = 180^\circ - \angle ABD - \angle BAD = 180^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} - \theta = 180^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}.
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BCD\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\sin\left(\frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{BD}{\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\ right)}.
\]
Since \(BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2 - 100} = \sqrt{21 + x^2}\), we get:

Since \(AB = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\), we get:

\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

### Part 1: \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, consider \(x^4 + 4x^2\):
- \(x^4\) is always non-negative for any real \(x\).
- \(4x^2\) is always non-negative for any real \(x\).

Thus, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all \(x\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0, and thus it is always greater than \(-4\):

So, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all \(x\).

### Part 2: \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\ )

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

To solve this, let's define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rewriting it as a quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

We solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots. Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):

\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2 } \]

So the roots are:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard the negative root \(-7\). Thus, the valid interval for \(y\) is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\), we translate this back to \(x\):
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Conclusion

Combining the results from both parts, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the solution in interval notation is:
\[
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}

"To solve for \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by analyzing the given equations:
1. \(xyz = 4\)
2. \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\)
3. \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\)

We use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).\]
We also know that:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + xz + yz).\]
 Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + xz + yz\). Then we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the identity for the sum of cubes, we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we use the third equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.\]
Given that this expression equals 12, we have:
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
which simplifies to:
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\)
2. \(sp = 24\)
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[p = \frac{24}{s }.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to:
\[s^3 = 64,\]
so:
\[s = 4.\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[\boxed{6}.\]```

"To determine which level has the number of boys who ride the bus closest to 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus, we need to calculate 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus for each level and compare it to the number of boys who ride the bus for that level.

Let's go through each level step by step:

1. **9th level:**
   - Number of girls who ride the bus = 39.4% of 300 = \(0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus = \(1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.87\)
   - Number of boys who ride the bus = 41.1% of 300 = \(0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - The difference between 159.87 and 123.3 is \(159.87 - 123.3 = 36.57\)

2.  **10th level:**
   - Number of girls who ride the bus = 33.1% of 300 = \(0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus = \(1.35 \times 99.3 = 133.845\)
   - Number of boys who ride the bus = 34.4% of 300 = \(0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - The difference between 133.845 and 103.2 is \(133.845 - 103.2 = 30.645\)

3. **11th level:**
   - Number of girls who ride the bus = 13.8% of 300 = \(0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus = \(1.35 \times 41 .4 = 55.89\)
   - Number of boys who ride the bus = 20.6% of 300 = \(0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - The difference between 55.89 and 61.8 is \(61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91\)

4. **12th level:**
   - Number of girls who ride the bus = 8.6% of 300 = \(0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - 135% of the number of girls who ride the bus = \(1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.93\)
   - Number of boys who ride the bus = 11.6% of 300 = \(0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so we have:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, so the numerator is non-negative. The expression will be negative if the denominator is negative because a non-negative number divided by a negative number is negative. The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\)  and \(x-36\) have opposite signs. This happens in the intervals where \(x\) is between 0 and 36, but not including 0 and 36. Therefore, we need to exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set.

So, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36.
\]
In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
(0, 36).
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

The final answer is \(\boxed{(0, 36)}\). This means that the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is satisfied for all \(x\) in the interval \((0, 36)\). This is because the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is negative for \(0 < x < 36\), making the entire fraction negative in this interval.","[Interval.open(0, 36), '(0, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"1. **Identify the dimensions and the shape of the park:**
   - The park is a rectangle with two semicircles on its top and bottom edges.
   - The length of the rectangle is given as 400 meters.
   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the diameter of the semicircles.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the semicircles:**
   - Let the width of the rectangle (and the diameter of the semicircles) be \( w \) meters.
   - The radius of each semicircle is therefore \( \frac{w}{2} \) meters.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the park:**
   - The perimeter of the park consists of the two lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.
   - The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{w}{2} = \frac{\pi w}{2} \).
   - Since there are two semicircles, their total circumference is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w \).
   - The total perimeter of the park is then \(  2 \times 400 + \pi w = 800 + \pi w \).

4. **Express the perimeter in terms of the width:**
   - We need to find the width \( w \) that maximizes the area of the park.
   - The area \( A \) of the park is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles.
   - The area of the rectangle is \( 400w \).
   - The area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{w}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{w^2}{4} = \frac{\pi w^2}{8} \).
   - The total area of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi w^2}{8} = \frac{\pi w^2}{4} \).
   - Therefore, the total area \( A \) is \( 400w + \frac{\pi w^2}{4} \).

5. **Find the value of \( w \) that maximizes the area :**
   - To maximize the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero.
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dw} = 400 + \frac{\pi w}{2} = 0
   \]
   \[
   400 = \frac{\pi w}{2}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{800}{\pi}
   \]

6. **Calculate the maximum area:**
   - Substitute \( w = \frac{800}{\pi} \) back into the area formula.
   \[
   A = 400 \left( \frac{800}{\pi} \right) + \frac{\pi}{4} \left( \frac{800}{\pi} \right)^2

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\) given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(\angle RST\) is a right angle, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the sides of the triangle relative to the given angle.
2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the missing side.
3. Determine \(\sin{T}\) using the identified sides of the triangle.

Since \(\angle RST\) is a right angle, \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) as the acute angles. The side opposite \(\angle R\) is the leg \(RS\), the side opposite \(\angle T\) is the leg \(ST\), and the hypotenuse is \(RT\).

Given:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
In a right triangle, \(\sin\) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, if we let \(RS = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) (where \(k\) is a positive constant), then  the length of the side \(ST\) (the other leg) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
(5k)^2 = (2k)^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
25k^2 = 4k^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
ST^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2
\]
\[
ST^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
ST = k\sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In \(\triangle RST\), \(\sin{T}\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite \(\angle T\) to the hypotenuse:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Therefore, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Substituting \( y \) from the curve equation, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand the square term:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
 \]

To minimize \( d \), we minimize \( d^2 \):

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the expression becomes:

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}
\]

This is a quadratic function in \( u \). To find the minimum value, we take the derivative with respect to \( u \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{du} \left( \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2} \right) = u - 2
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
u - 2 = 0
\]

\[
u = 2
\]

Since \( u = x^2 \), we have:

\[
x^2 = 2 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute \( x = \sqrt{2} \) back into the curve equation to find \( y \):

\ [
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the point on the curve is \( (\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

Now, calculate the distance from the origin to this point:

\[
d = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Therefore, the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Adding these values together:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \).

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). We set this equal to 0:
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). We set this equal to 0:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
\]
Factor out \( x \):
\[
x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
 \]
This gives us one solution:
\[
x = 0
\]
However, \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We solve the quadratic equation:
\[
-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
\]
Multiply through by \(-1\):
\[
x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
\]
Factor the quadratic:
\[
(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
\]
Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Thus, there are no valid solutions in this case.

From the above cases, we conclude:
\[
f^{-1}(0) = 3
\]

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \).

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). We set this equal to 6:
\[
3 - x = 6  \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), we have:
\[
f^{-1}(6) = -3
\]

### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). We set this equal to 6:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
\]
Rearrange to form a polynomial equation:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
-(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
\]
Thus, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no valid solutions in this case.

From the above The final answer is :

"To determine the distance from point \(P\) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we start by noting that an octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be chosen such that they are symmetrically placed with respect to the center of the octahedron. If we place the octahedron in a coordinate system with the center at the origin \((0,0,0)\), the vertices can be at \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\).

Given the distances from point \(P\) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A = (1, 0, 0)\), \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\), \(C = (0, 1, 0)\), \(D = (0, -1, 0)\), \( E = (0, 0, 1)\), and \(F = (0, 0, -1)\).

The distance from \(P = (x, y, z)\) to a vertex is given by the Euclidean distance formula. For example, the distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
Similarly, the distance from \(P\) to \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(E\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]

We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth  vertex, which is \(F = (0, 0, -1)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

To find this distance, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. For a regular octahedron with side length \(a\), this constant is \(6a^2\). However, since the problem does not specify the side length, we can use the fact that the distances given are specific and solve for the unknown distance.

By squaring the given distances and summing them, we can find the unknown distance. The sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to the five given vertices is:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324

Let the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex be \(d\). Then the sum of the squares of all six distances is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, which is given by Newton's second law of motion: \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

First, let's denote the force applied to both the balle de baseball and the balle de softball as \( F \), the mass of the balle de baseball as \( m_b = 150 \) g, the mass of the balle de softball as \( m_s = 200 \) g, the acceleration of the balle de baseball as \( a_b \), and the acceleration of the balle de softball as \( a_s \).

According to Newton's second law, the force applied to the balle de baseball is:
\[ F = m_b a_b = 150 a_b \]
And the force applied to the balle de softball is:
\[ F = m_s a_s = 200 a_s \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both balls, we can set the two expressions for \( F \) equal to each other:
\[ 150  a_b = 200 a_s \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the balle de softball to the acceleration of the balle de baseball, which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \). From the equation above, we can solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the balle de softball to the acceleration of the balle de baseball is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

"To determine how many identical digits we get in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we need to first convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases and then compare the digits.

1. **Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7:**
   - Divide 629 by 7: \(629 \div 7 = 89\) with a remainder of 6. So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 6.
   - Divide 89 by 7: \(89 \div 7 = 12\) with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.
   - Divide 12 by 7: \(12 \div 7 = 1\) with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.
   - Divide 1 by 7: \(1 \div 7 = 0\) with a remainder of 1. So, the most significant digit (leftmost) is 1.
   - Therefore, \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

2.  **Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8:**
   - Divide 629 by 8: \(629 \div 8 = 78\) with a remainder of 5. So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 5.
   - Divide 78 by 8: \(78 \div 8 = 9\) with a remainder of 6. So, the next digit is 6.
   - Divide 9 by 8: \(9 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of 1. So, the next digit is 1.
   - Divide 1 by 8: \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of 1. So, the most significant digit (leftmost) is 1.
   - Therefore, \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

3. **Compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):**
   - The digits of \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
   - The digits of \(1 165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.
   - The common digits are 1, 5, and 6.

Thus, we have 3 identical digits in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8. The answer is \(\boxed{3}\).```

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sorciers and the混合ers. The key point is that each of the six sorciers has sate itself with one of the ten mixers, and none of the mixers have sate with their own. This implies that each sower has sate with one of the mixers, and each混合er has sate with one of the sowers.

Let's denote the sowers as \( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6 \) and the mixers as \( M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6, M_7, M_8, M_9, M_{10} \). Each sower \( S_i \) is sate with one of the mixers, say \( M_{f(i)} \), where \( f \) is a function that maps each sower to a unique混合er. Since there are only six sowers and ten mixers, and each sower is sate with a unique混合er, there are four mixers who are not sate with any sowers.

 The problem asks for the number of people who have sate with their own. Since each sower is sate with one of the mixers and none of the mixers are sate with their own, the only people who have sate with their own are the mixers. Specifically, the six mixers who are not sated with their own are the ones who have sate with the sowers. Therefore, the number of people who have sate with their own is the number of mixers who are not sated with their own, which is 4.

Thus, the number of people who have sate with their own is \(\boxed{4}\).```

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1 )^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

First, let's denote the polynomial by \(P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following about the roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\):

\]
\[
B = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

\[
C = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 .

Since \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are roots of the polynomial, we can use the identity for the sum of all possible products of two roots:

"To determine the cost of one crayon, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) be the cost of one crayon in cents, and let \( g \) be the cost of one gomme jumbo in cents.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. two crayons and one gomme jumbo cost \$1.24, which is 124 cents.
2. four crayons and one gomme jumbo cost \$1.82, which is 182 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of linear equations:
\[ 2c + g = 124 \]
\[ 4c + g = 182 \]

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (4c + g) - (2c + g) = 182 - 124 \]
\[ 4c + g - 2c - g = 58 \]
\[ 2c = 58 \]
\[ c = \frac{58}{2} \]
\[ c = 29 \ ]

So, the cost of one crayon is \( 29 \) cents.

To verify our solution, we can substitute \( c = 29 \) back into the first equation to find \( g \):
\[ 2(29) + g = 124 \]
\[ 58 + g = 124 \]
\[ g = 124 - 58 \]
\[ g = 66 \]

Now, let's check the second equation with \( c = 29 \) and \( g = 66 \):
\[ 4(29) + 66 = 116 + 66 = 182 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the cost of one crayon is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.```\\

First, we simplify the fraction:

Next, we perform the division to convert it to a decimal. We can do this by long division or by using a calculator:

To identify the last non-zero digit, we look at the digits in the decimal expansion:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's establish the coordinates of the points. Assume the rectangle \(ABCD\) is positioned in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, a)\), \(B = (a, a)\), \(C = (a, -a)\), and \(D = (-a, -a)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, a)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]

We need to find the region within the rectangle where the distance to the center \(O\) is less than the distance to any vertex.  This region can be described by the inequalities:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2}

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2

\[

Expanding and simplifying each inequality , we get:
1. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax - 2ay + 2a^2 \implies 0 < 2a(x - y + a)\)
2. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + 2ay + 2a^2 \implies 0 < 2a(-x + y + a)\)
3. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + 2ay + 2a^2 \implies 0 < 2a(x + y + a)\)

\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points:

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( 1.0472 \) is \( 2 \).  Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( 45 = 9 \times 5 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 6.7082 \) is \( 6 \). Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \(  8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 4 \) is \( 4 \). Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much Jim Marches less than Martha, we need to calculate the distances each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim traverses the rectangle along its diagonal. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the rectangle. The total distance Martha travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[ \text{Distance } = l + w \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]
So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:

"给定 \(\omega\) 是一个满足 \(\omega^3 = 1\) 的复数，我们知道 \(\omega\) 是一个原始的三次单位根。三次单位根满足方程 \(x^3 - 1 = 0\)，这可以分解为 \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\)。因此，根是 \(1, \omega, \omega^2\)，其中 \(\omega\) 和 \(\omega^2\) 是非实数的三次单位根。这些根满足 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)。

我们需要找到表达式 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值。

首先，我们找到一个共同的分母：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \ omega^3}.
\]
由于 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，分母简化为：
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]
因此，表达式变为：
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = 1.
\]
因此，表达式的值是 \(\boxed{1}\)。 uniquely possible value is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To determine the shortest distance you can travel by visiting three out of the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and then find the shortest route that visits three of these points exactly once.

First, let's list the distances given in the diagram:
- \(DB = 3\)
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(DC = 4\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)

We need to find the shortest path that visits three of these points. We can consider all possible combinations of three points and calculate the total distance for each combination.

### Case 1: Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\)
The possible routes are:
1. \(A \to B \to C \to A\)
2. \(A \to C \to B \to A\)

** Route \(A \to B \to C \to A\):**
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(CA = 6\)
Total distance: \(5 + 6 + 6  = 17\)

**Route \(A \to C \to B \to A\):**
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(CB = 6\)
- \(BA = 5\)
Total distance: \(6 + 6 + 5 = 17\)

### Case 2: Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\)
The possible routes are:
1. \(A \to B \to D \to A\)
2. \(A \to D \to B \to A\)

** Route \(A \to B \to D \to A\):**
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(DA = 5\)
Total distance: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)

**Route \(A \to D \to B \to A\):**
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(DB = 3\)
- \(BA = 5\)
Total distance: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)

### Case 3: Points \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\)
The possible routes are:
1 . \(A \to C \to D \to A\)
2. \(A \to D \to C \to A\)

**Route \(A \to C \to D \to A\):**
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(CD = 4\)
- \(DA = 5\)
Total distance: \(6 + 4 + 5 = 15\)

**Route \(A \to D \to C \to A\):**
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(DC = 4\)
- \(CA = 6\)
Total distance: \(5 + 4 + 6 = 15\)

### Case 4: Points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\)
The possible routes are:
1. \(B \to C \to D \to B\)
2. \(B \to D \to C \to B\)

**Route \(B \to C \to D \to B\):**
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(CD = 4\)
- \(DB = 3\)
Total distance: \(6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)

**Route The final answer is $\boxed{13}$.","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
