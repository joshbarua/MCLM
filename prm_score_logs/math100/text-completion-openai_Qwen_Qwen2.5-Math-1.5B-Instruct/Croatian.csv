"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle E = 90^\circ \), we know the following:
- \( \sin D = 0.7 \)
- \( EF = 7 \)

We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
Given \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]

To solve for \( DE \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( DE \):
\[
0.7 \cdot DE = 7
\]

Next, divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
DE = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\):**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\ ), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

   Expanding the product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To find the square root of 242, we can start by simplifying the expression by factoring 242 into its prime factors. 

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]

Next, we factor 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11 \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 = 2 \times 11^2 \]

 Now, we can find the square root of 242 using the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\):
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the square root of 242 is:
\[ \boxed{11\sqrt{2}} \]``````

The final answer is $\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}$. This is the simplified form of the square root of 242. We used the property of square roots to break down the expression and simplify it. We first factored 242 into its prime factors and then used the property of square roots to separate the factors. Finally, we simplified the expression to get the answer. This problem tests our understanding of simplifying square roots and factoring numbers into their prime factors. It is a fundamental problem in algebra and is often tested in math competitions.

"To find the coefficient of the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify each part of the term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k }
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{1}{x^{2k}} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Now, combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} \cdot (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

We need the term where the power of \(x\) is zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
 \]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the coefficient:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3}
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
(-1)^3 = -1
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 1000 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = -125

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \mod 7\) given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
(n + 4) = 2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
(n + 6) = 2 + 6 = 8
\]

So, we need to find the value of \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \mod 7\). We can simplify this step by step by reducing each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we can substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1  \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \mod 7\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

So, we have:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the value of \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \mod 7\) is \(\boxed{3}\).```\\

"1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of Afterwards operations required so that the product of any two numbers in a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 is divisible by 100.
   - A "" operation"" involves choosing any two adjacent numbers in the sequence and replacing them with their product.

2. **Analyzing the divisibility condition:**
   - For a product to be divisible by 100, it must be divisible by both 4 and 25.
   - This means that in the sequence, there must be enough factors of 2 and 5 such that any two adjacent numbers can be combined to form a product divisible by 100.

3. **Counting the factors of 2 and 5 in the sequence:**
   - The number of factors of 2 in the sequence from 1 to 100 is calculated by summing the integer divisions:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{100}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{8} \ right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{16} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{32} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{64} \right\rfloor = 50 + 25 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 97
     \]
   - The number of factors of 5 in the sequence from 1 to 100 is calculated by summing the integer divisions:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{125} \right\rfloor = 20 + 4 + 0 = 24
     \]

4. **Determining the minimum number of operations:**
   - To ensure that any two adjacent numbers can be combined to form a product divisible by 100, we need to ensure that there are enough factors of 2  and 5 in the sequence.
   - The number of factors of 2 in the sequence is 97, which is more than sufficient.
   - The number of factors of 5 in the sequence is 24, which is less than 4 (since \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\)).
   - Therefore, we need to reduce the number of factors of 5 to 4 by combining numbers until we have 4 factors of 5.

5. **Calculating the number of operations required:**
   - To reduce 24 factors of 5 to 4 factors of 5, we need to combine 20 pairs of numbers (since \(24 - 4 = 20\)).
   - Each operation involves combining two adjacent numbers, so the number of operations required is 20.

The final answer is \(\boxed{20}\) operations are required.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints are the same. Therefore, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} =  6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means our initial assumption about the vertices might need re-evaluation in the context of the problem. Let's consider the possibility that the vertices are not necessarily in the order given and re-evaluate the problem with the condition \(x > 7\).

If we assume \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\) are the vertices of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is equal to the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\). The vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is:
\[
(6-5,  8-3) = (1, 5)
\]
So the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) is also \((1, 5)\):
\[
(x-7, y-4) = (1, 5)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
x - 7 = 1 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
y - 4 = 5 \implies y = 9
\]

So the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Now we need to find the value of \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{17}\).```

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine its vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes.

### Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. First, we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the potential vertical asymptotes:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2 \]

We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:

For \( x = 7 \):
\[ 2x = 2(7) = 14 \neq 0 \]

For \( x = -2 \):
\[ 2x = 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0 \]

Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), these are indeed vertical asymptotes . Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \). We compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:

- The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
- The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Sum \( a + b + c \)
We now sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

Let's denote the matrix by \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). We need to find the operator norm of \( A \), which is the largest value of \(\frac{\|A\bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|}\) for any non-zero vector \(\bold{v}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\ [
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) of \( A^T A \) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 4 \cdot 13 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 16)(\lambda - 1) = 0

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda = 16\)  and \(\lambda = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16. Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \( C = 4 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \(z\) is a fifth root of unity, which means \(z^5 = 1\) and \(z \neq 1\). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

We need to find the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{z} = z^4\). Similarly, \(\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

From the equation \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\), we can isolate \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z\) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[ 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 \]
Calculating each term:
\[ 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
\[ 8 \cdot 1 = 8 \]
Adding these together:
\[ 45 + 8 = 53 \]
So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[ 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 \]
Calculating each term:
\[ 1 \cdot 9  = 9 \]
\[ 8 \cdot 1 = 8 \]
Adding these together:
\[ 9 + 8 = 17 \]
So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[ 53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10} \]

### Step 4: Convert the result back to base 9
To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[ 36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0 \]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
Next, we need a common denominator to combine these fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we substitute this into the expression :
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.

"Let's denote the weight of a square as \( s \), the weight of a rectangle as \( r \), and the weight of a circle as \( c \). We are given two pieces of information:

1. A treehouse, a square, and a rectangle weigh the same as three circles. This can be written as:
\[ t + s + r = 3c \]

2. Two treehouses and one rectangle weigh the same as one square. This can be written as:
\[ 2t + r = s \]

We need to find out how many treehouses weigh the same as one circle. Let's express \( s \) and \( r \) in terms of \( t \) and \( c \).

First, solve the second equation for \( r \):
\[ r = s - 2t \]

Now substitute \( r \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ t + s + (s - 2t) = 3c \]
\[ t + s + s - 2t = 3c \]
\[ 2s - t = 3c \]
\[ 2s = t + 3c \]
\[ s = \frac{t + 3c}{ 2} \]

Now substitute \( s \) back into the expression for \( r \):
\[ r = s - 2t \]
\[ r = \frac{t + 3c}{2} - 2t \]
\[ r = \frac{t + 3c - 4t}{2} \]
\[ r = \frac{3c - 3t}{2} \]
\[ r = \frac{3(c - t)}{2} \]

Now we need to find out how many treehouses weigh the same as one circle. Let \( x \) be the number of treehouses that weigh the same as one circle. Then:
\[ x \cdot t = c \]
\[ x = \frac{c}{t} \]

We know from the equation \( 2s = t + 3c \) that:
\[ 2 \left( \frac{t + 3c}{2} \right) = t + 3c \]
This is consistent, so let's substitute \( s = \frac{t + 3c}{2} \) and \( r = \frac{3(c - t)}{2} \) back into the first equation to check :
\[ t + \frac{t + 3c}{2} + \frac{3(c - t)}{2} = 3c \]
\[ t + \frac{t + 3c + 3c - 3t}{2} = 3c \]
\[ t + \frac{-2t + 6c}{2} = 3c \]
\[ t + -t + 3c = 3c \]
\[ 3c = 3c \]
This is true, so our expressions for \( s \) and \( r \) are correct. Now, we need to find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{c}{t} \]
From the equation \( 2s = t + 3c \), we can express \( c \) in terms of \( t \) and \( s \):
\[ 3c = 2s - t \]
\[ c = \frac{2s - t}{3} \]
Substitute \( s = \frac{t + 3c}{2} \):
\[ c = \frac{2 \left( \frac{t + 3c}{2} \right) - t}{3 } \]
\[ c = \frac{t + 3c - t}{3} \]
\[ c = \frac{3c}{3} \]
\[ c = c \]
This is consistent, so the number of treehouses that weigh the same as one circle is:
\[ x = \frac{c}{t} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of treehouses that weigh the same as one circle is \(\boxed{2}\).```

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we need to expand the product and compare coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product:

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
 \[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combine all these products:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal the given polynomial:
\[
12t^4 + 26t^ 3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:
1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

Solve the first equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the second equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the third equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct .

Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the fourth equation to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know that the volume of the cylinder is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters and the height is 4 meters. We need to find the radius \( r \).

First, substitute the known values into the volume formula:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Then, solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects the horizontal line \(y = m\) at exactly one point, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's find the conditions under which the graph intersects the horizontal line \(y = m\) at exactly one point. This means that the equation \(f(x) = m\) must have exactly one solution.

### Case 1: \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). Setting \(f(x) = m\), we get:
\[
ax^2 = m.
\]
Solving for \(x\), we have:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{m}{a}}.
\]
For \(x\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we need:
\[
\sqrt{\frac {m}{a}} \geq a.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{m}{a} \geq a^2.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(a\) (assuming \(a > 0\)), we obtain:
\[
m \geq a^3.
\]

### Case 2: \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). Setting \(f(x) = m\), we get:
\[
ax + 2a = m.
\]
Solving for \(x\), we have:
\[
x = \frac{m - 2a}{a}.
\]
For \(x\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x < a\). Therefore, we need:
\[
\frac{m - 2a}{a} < a.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(a\) (assuming \(a > 0\)), we obtain:
\[
m - 2a < a^2.
\]
Adding \(2a\) to both sides, we get:
\[
m < a^2 + 2a.
\ ]

### Combining the Conditions
To have the graph intersect the horizontal line \(y = m\) at exactly one point, the conditions \(m \geq a^3\) and \(m < a^2 + 2a\) must be either both true or both false. Therefore, we need:
\[
a^3 \leq m < a^2 + 2a.
\]
For \(m\) to be the same for both conditions, the boundary values must coincide:
\[
a^3 = a^2 + 2a.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(a\), we obtain:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(a^2 - a - 2 = 0\), we get:
\[
a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
a = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad a = -1.
 \]
Since \(a\) must be a positive integer, we discard \(a = -1\) and keep \(a = 2\).

To verify, if \(a = 2\):
\[
a^3 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 + 2a = 4 + 4 = 8.
\]
So, \(a = 2\) satisfies \(a^3 = a^2 + 2a\), meaning the conditions \(m = 8\) will intersect the graph at exactly one point.

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions is:

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms, \( x^2 - 10x \):
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x-5)^2 - 25. \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms, \( y^2 + 6y \):
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9. \]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0. \]
R earranging terms, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0. \]
Adding 34 to both sides, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c. \]

The equation \( (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by \( r^2 = 34 - c \). We are given that the radius is 1, so:
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1. \]
Therefore, we have:
\[ 34 - c = 1. \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 = 33. \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) = \lambda x - \lambda x^2.\]
Now, we substitute \(f(x)\) into \(f\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)(1 - (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)).\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[1 - (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2.\]
Thus,
\[f(f(x)) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 x (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We need to find \ (\lambda\) such that there exists some \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\). That is, we need to solve:
\[\lambda^2 x (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
Factoring out \(x\) from both sides, we get:
\[x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\).

1. If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which satisfies the condition.
2. If \(x \neq 0\), then we need to solve:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). To find specific values  of \(\lambda\), we can check the boundary conditions and possible values of \(x\).

Let's check the specific values of \(\lambda\):

- If \(\lambda = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\), so \(f(f(x)) = 0 \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 0\) does not work.
- If \(\lambda = 4\), then \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2\). We need to check if there is any \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).\]
We need:
\[16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = x.\]
Factoring out \(x\ ), we get:
\[x \left( 16 (1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1 \right) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if \(x = 0\) or \(16 (1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 1\). For \(x = 0\), it satisfies. For the other part, we need to solve:
\[16 (1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 1.\]
This is a cubic equation, and we need to check if it has any solutions in the interval \([0,1]\). By substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), we get:
\[16 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( 1 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \right) = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4 \neq 1.\]
 So, \(\lambda = 4\) does not work either. However, we can check \(\lambda = 2\):
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.\]
We need to check if there is any \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - x)^2 = 4x(1 - x)^3.\]
We need:
\[4x(1 - x)^3 = x.\]

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression inside the tangent function. The given equation is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall the identities:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B)
\]

 First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ -  \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified expressions back into the original equation:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

We can use the co-function identities \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\) to further simplify:

\[
\tan \theta  = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We can use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 5^\circ\) as \(\cos 85^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 85^\circ}
\]

Using the angle addition formulas again, we can see that the expression simplifies to \(\tan 65^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \tan 65^\circ

Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:

"To solve the problem of how to inscribe a rectangle in an ellipse, let's go through the steps in detail.

1. **Understand the Geometry of the Problem**: An ellipse is defined by its equation in the coordinate plane. For simplicity, let's consider the standard form of the ellipse equation:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
   \]
   where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.

2. **Inscribe a Rectangle**: To inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the rectangle must have its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. This means that the vertices of the rectangle will touch the ellipse at four points.

3. **Coordinates of the Vertices**: Let's denote the vertices of the rectangle as \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((-x, -y)\), and \((x, -y)\). These points must satisfy the ellipse equation. Therefore, we can use the point \((x, y)\) to find the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[
   \frac{x^2 }{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
   \]

4. **Express \(y\) in Terms of \(x\)**: Solve the ellipse equation for \(y\):
   \[
   \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}
   \]
   \[
   y^2 = b^2 \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)
   \]
   \[
   y = b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}
   \]

5. **Area of the Rectangle**: The area \(A\) of the rectangle is given by the product of its width and height. The width is \(2x\) and the height is \(2y\):
   \[
   A = 2x \cdot 2y = 4xy
   \]
   Substitute \(y\) from the previous step:
   \[
   A = 4x \cdot b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} = 4bx \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2 }}
   \]

6. **Maximize the Area**: To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \(A\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero. Let \(A(x) = 4bx \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}\).

   First, use the product rule to differentiate:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 4b \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left(-\frac{2x}{a^2}\right) \right)
   \]
   Simplify the derivative:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 4b \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} - \frac{x^2}{a^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}} \right)
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 4b \left(  \frac{a^2 - x^2 - x^2}{a^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}} \right)
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 4b \left( \frac{a^2 - 2x^2}{a^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}} \right)
   \]

7. **Set the Derivative to Zero**:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 0 \implies a^2 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{a^2}{2} \implies x = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

8. **Find Corresponding \(y\)**:
   \[
   y = b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} = b \sqrt{1 - \frac{a^2/2}{a^2}} = b \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = b \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{b}{\sqrt {2}}
   \]

9. **Vertices of the Rectangle**: The vertices of the inscribed rectangle are \(\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\), \(\left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\), \(\left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\), and \(\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right), \left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right), \left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \right), \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} \","[Interval.open(a/(sqrt(2)), -b/(sqrt(2))), '{( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}} ), ( -\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}} ), ( -\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}} ), ( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{2}}']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",False
"To determine how many zeros are in the factorial of 42, denoted as \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

First, we count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) because there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials.

The number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is given by the sum of the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4  \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
All higher powers of 5 will contribute 0 because \(42 < 125\). Therefore, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]

Since there are at least 9 factors of 2 in \(42!\) (in fact, there are more), the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is determined by the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5, which is 9.

Thus, the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"To determine the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) over the domain \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, observe that \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). To find the maximum value, we can consider specific values of \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's first check the value of \( f \) at the points where \( x = y \):
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we need to maximize \( x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Let \( g(x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( g(x ) \) and setting it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \) gives:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} = \frac{1}{2}. \]
Thus, the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is:
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
So, the maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1. We need to check if this is indeed the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) over the entire domain.

Next, we check the boundary values. If \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \), then either \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \) or \( y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so the value of \( f(x, y) \) will be 0. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To find the Please provide the problem statement clearly. 

To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we need to use the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by these vectors is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\ right)
\]

\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]

\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}

So, the cross product vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\). The magnitude of this vector is:

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:

"1. **Identify the given equation:**
   \[
   z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
   \]
   This suggests that \(z\) is a complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane, i.e., \( |z| = 1 \).

2. **Express \(z\) in exponential form:**
   Since \(z\) lies on the unit circle, we can write:
   \[
   z = e^{i\theta}
   \]
   where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\).

3. **Substitute \(z = e^{i\theta}\) into the given equation:**
   \[
   e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
   \]
   Using Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos(\theta)\), we get:
   \[
   2\cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \(\cos(\theta)\):
   \ [
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}
   \]

4. **Determine \(\theta\):**
   Let \(\alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\). Then:
   \[
   \theta = \pm \cos^{-1}\left(\alpha\right)
   \]

5. **Calculate \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\):**
   Using the exponential form:
   \[
   z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta)
   \]

6. **Simplify \(\cos(85\theta)\):**
   Since \(\cos(\theta) = \alpha\), we use the periodicity of the cosine function. Note that \ (\cos(\theta + 2k\pi) = \cos(\theta)\) for any integer \(k\). Therefore:
   \[
   85\theta = 85\cos^{-1}\left(\alpha\right) = 42\pi + \theta
   \]
   because \(85\theta\) is equivalent to \(\theta\) modulo \(2\pi\).

7. **Evaluate \(\cos(85\theta)\):**
   \[
   \cos(85\theta) = \cos(42\pi + \theta) = \cos(\theta) = \alpha
   \]

8. **Final result:**
   \[
   z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2\alpha = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships involved. We start by noting that the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Given that the line through \( G \) is parallel to \( BC \) and intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the properties of similar triangles to find the relationship between the areas of triangles \( ABC \) and \( AGN \).

Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AGN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their heights from the common vertex \( A \) to the bases \( MN \) and \( BC \). Because \( G \) is the centroid, it divides each median in the ratio 2:1, so the height from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height from \( A \) to \( BC \).

3. Calculate the number of books on the third police officer's shelf.
4. Identify the number of books on the third police officer's shelf that are written in mathematics.

First, let's identify the total number of books on all three police officers' shelves. According to the problem, the total number of books is 24.

Next, we need to identify the number of books on the first and second police officers' shelves. The first police officer has 8 books written in mathematics, and the second police officer has 10 books written in mathematics. The third police officer has 6 books written in mathematics.

Now, let's calculate the number of books on the third police officer's shelf. We do this by subtracting the number of books on the first and second police officers' shelves from the total number of books.

The total number of books on the first and second police officers' shelves is:

 The number of books on the third police officer's shelf is:

We are given that the third police officer has 6 books in total, and all of them are written in mathematics. Therefore, the number of books on the third police officer's shelf that are written in mathematics is:

The problem asks for the number of books on the third police officer's shelf that are written in mathematics as a fraction of the total books on that shelf. Since all 6 books on the third police officer's shelf are written in mathematics, the fraction is:

   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

2. Use the information given to set up equations for the 4th and 8th terms.

   \[
   a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500

3. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(a_1\) and solve for \(d\):

   \[

   \[

   \[
   n \geq \frac{100}{75}

   Since \(n\) must be a whole number, the smallest integer \(n\) that satisfies this inequality is \(n = 2\). However, we need to find the largest \(n\) such that \(a_n\) is still a positive integer, so we set \(a_n = 0\) and solve for \(n\):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many integer numbers are factors of both 100 and 150. This involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers and then counting the number of factors of the GCD.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - First, we find the prime factorization of 100.
     \[
     100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
     \]
   - Next, we find the prime factorization of 150.
     \[
     150 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2
     \]

2. **Determine the GCD:**
   - The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime that appears in both factorizations.
     - For the prime \(2\), the lowest power is \(2^1\).
     - For the prime \(3\), the lowest power is \(3^0\) (since 3 does not appear in the factorization of 100).
     - For the prime \(5\), the lowest power is \(5^2 \).
   - Therefore, the GCD is:
     \[
     \text{GCD} = 2^1 \times 3^0 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 1 \times 25 = 50
     \]

3. **Count the Number of Factors of the GCD:**
   - To find the number of factors of a number, we use the formula for the number of divisors. If \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of divisors \( d(n) \) is given by:
     \[

"To determine the largest integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 \) divides \( 2^{24} \), we need to analyze the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) and the conditions under which \( n^3 \) can be a divisor of \( 2^{24} \).

First, note that \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, specifically:
\[ 2^{24} = 2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2 \quad \text{(24 times)} \]

For \( n^3 \) to divide \( 2^{24} \), \( n \) itself must be a power of 2, because the only prime factor of \( 2^{24} \) is 2. Let \( n = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[ n^3 = (2^k)^3 = 2^{3k} \]

We need \( 2^{3k} \) to be a divisor of \( 2^{24} \). This means that \( 3k \leq 24 \). To  find the largest possible \( k \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 3k \leq 24 \]
\[ k \leq \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ k \leq 8 \]

The largest integer \( k \) that satisfies this inequality is \( k = 8 \). Therefore, the largest integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 \) divides \( 2^{24} \) is:
\[ n = 2^8 = 256 \]

Thus, the answer is:

However, the problem only gives us the cost of one ice cream cone, which is 75 centimeters, and the total amount of money she has, which is one dollar or 100 cents.

First, we need to find out how many 75 centimeter pieces fit into 100 cents. This can be calculated by dividing 100 cents by 75 centimeters:

\[

1. Identify the first six prime numbers.
2. Calculate their sum.
3. Determine if the sum is even or odd.
4. Since the sum is a single value, the probability that it is even is either 1 or 0.

The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Now, let's calculate their sum:

Let's start by substituting \( a = 4 \) into the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the coin tosses result in a specific outcome. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a coin that can either land on heads (H) or tails (T).
   - We need to find the probability that the coin lands on heads exactly 3 times out of 5 tosses.

2. **binomial Probability Formula:**
   The probability of getting exactly \( k \) heads in \( n \) tosses of a fair coin is given by the binomial probability formula:
   \[
   P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
   \]
   where:
   - \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes (heads) out of \( n \) trials (tosses).
   - \( p \) is the probability of getting heads on a single toss, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - \( 1-p \) is the probability of getting tails on a single toss, which is also \(  \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \), and \( p = \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient:**
   \[
   \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

5. **Calculate the Probability:**
   \[
   P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{5-3} = 10 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 10 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = 10 \times \frac{1 }{32} = \frac{10}{32} = \frac{5}{16}

Therefore, the probability that the coin tosses result in exactly 3 heads out of 5 tosses is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{16}}\).```

1. **Simplify the fraction**: The denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot 10^{-7} = 2160.5 \cdot 10^{-7} = 0.0000021605

   The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(0.0000021605\ ).

2. **Identify the signs of the digits**: The decimal \(0.0000021605\) has the digits \(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). The signs of these digits are \(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, +2, +1, +6, 0, +5\). The sum of the signs is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use some trigonometric identities and properties of the sine function. Let's start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\).

This identity tells us that:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin  20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rearrange this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]

This can be written as:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\ ).

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\), and \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = \cos^2 70^\circ, \quad \sin^2 40^\circ = \cos^2 50^\circ, \quad \sin^2 80^\circ = \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

So the expression is:
\[
\cos^2 70^\circ \cos^2 50^\circ \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

We can  use the identity \(\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) again to simplify further, but it is easier to use the product-to-sum identities and symmetry properties of the sine and cosine functions.

Thus, the original expression is:

"To determine which geometric shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates, we need to understand the meaning of the equation in the context of cylindrical coordinates.

Cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) are a three-dimensional coordinate system where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane from the positive \( x \)-axis,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) specifies that the height \( z \) is constant and equal to \( c \). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), while the \( r \) and \( \theta \) coordinates can vary.

This description corresponds to a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and is located at a distance \( c \) from the \( xy \)-plane along the positive \( z \)-axis. This plane extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, forming a horizontal flat surface.

Therefore, the geometric shape described  by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane, but in the context of the given choices, the closest geometric shape that matches this description is a cylinder.

The function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) can be expanded by substituting \( x+5 \) for \( x \) in the function \( f(x) \):
\[
g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015.
\]
To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). Here, \( g(x) \) is a cubic polynomial, so we need to  find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) and the leading coefficient of \( g(x) \).

First, we expand \( g(x) \):
\[
g(x) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015.
\]
Expanding each term, we get:
\[
(x+5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125,
\]
\[
-49(x+5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225,

\[
623(x+5) = 623x + 3115.

Combining all these, we have:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015.

 Simplifying the expression, we get:

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0.

The sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) with the opposite sign, which is \( 34 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ S = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} \]

First, recall that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(S\) as:

\[ S = \sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ \]

We know that \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\). Thus,  we can express \(S\) as:

\[ S = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ \]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ\). Using the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\), we  know that \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ\).

We can use the known result that the sum \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 15\). This result can be derived from more advanced trigonometric identities or verified through specific trigonometric calculations.

Next, we solve for \( n \). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

 Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[
n = 8
\]

So, the number of sides of the polygon is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]``````

The final answer is \( \boxed{8} \). This means the polygon has 8 sides. The reasoning is based on the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is 180(n-2) degrees, and solving the resulting equation.

"To find the number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We need to find the integer solutions for \( t \) in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \). To do this, we can test each value of \( t \) from 1 to 22. However, a more efficient approach is to use the quadratic formula for congruences. The quadratic formula for \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{p}. \]
 Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \), so the discriminant is:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 4 + 4 = 8. \]
We need to find the modular square root of 8 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \). By testing, we find:
\[ 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}.  \]
So, \( x = 10 \) is a solution. Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \pmod{23}. \]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
So, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check that these values satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.
For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6, \]
and we need to check if 6 is the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23. This means we need to check if:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \ ]
Since:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
6 is indeed the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23.
For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19, \]
and we need to check if 19 is the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23. This means we need to check if:
\[ 17 \cdot 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Since:
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
19 is indeed the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23.
Therefore, the values of \( t \) that satisfy the condition are 4 and 17. The problem asks for one such value, so we can choose either. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \] or \(\boxed{17}\). However, since the problem asks for one such value, we can choose either. The answer is:

"To find the sum of the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

Calculating the squares, we get:

We know that:
- The number 1 is not a prime number.
- The number 2 is not an odd number, so it is not part of this sequence.
- All other even numbers are not prime because they are divisible by 2.

Let's list the prime numbers in the sequence of odd numbers:

- 7 is a prime number.
- 9 is not a prime number (divisible by 3).

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Use the result from step 1 to find \( f(5) - 1 \).
3. Use the result from step 2 to evaluate \( g(f(5) - 1) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we need to find \( f(5) \):

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Let's start by analyzing the arguments of the inverse trigonometric functions.

First, recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because \(\cot^{-1} y = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then \(\ sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac }}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Therefore, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
We need to check if these solutions are valid by ensuring that they do not make the arguments of the inverse trigonometric functions undefined or outside their domains. For \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), the arguments can be any real number, so both solutions are valid.

Thus, the solutions to the equation are:

Line 1: \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)
Line 2: \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\)

The direction vectors of the lines are:
\(\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)
\(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\)

We need to check if \(\mathbf{d_2}\) is a scalar multiple of \(\mathbf{d_1}\). Let's see if there is a scalar \(k\) such that \(\mathbf{d_2}  = k \mathbf{d_1}\).

We compare the components of \(\mathbf{d_2}\) with \(k \mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2k \\ -9k \\ -2k \end{pmatrix}
\]

This gives us the system of equations:
1. \(4 = 2k\)
2. \(-18 = -9k\)
3. \(-4 = -2k\)

From the first equation, we get:
\[k = \frac{4}{2} = 2\]

From the second equation, we get:
\[k = \frac{-18}{-9} = 2\]

From the third equation, we get:
\[k = \frac{-4}{-2} = 2\]

Since \(k = 2\) satisfies all three equations, we conclude that \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1 }\). Therefore, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, which means the lines are parallel.

The lines are parallel, and the check for equality of the lines involves verifying if there is a point of intersection, which is not necessary for parallelism but can be checked by further analysis if needed. However, the primary check for parallelism is satisfied.

Thus, the answer is:

The given points are: \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\).

First, let's check if these points can form a rectangle. A rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and all interior angles are right angles. We can see that the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\) have the same \(x\)-coordinate, and the points \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) have the same \(x\)-coordinate. This means that the lines connecting \((5,4)\) to \((5,-4)\) and \((-5,4)\) to \((-5,-4)\) are vertical and equal in length (both are 8 units long).

Similarly, the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) have the same \(y\)-coordinate, and the points \((5,-4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) have the same \( y\)-coordinate.

\]

We can further distribute inside each cross product:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

 and
\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero (\(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)), the last term disappears:

\[
-\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) -  3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, we have:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into our expression, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) =  6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

"Given trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(AB = c\)
- \(CD = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we need to determine the lengths of \(a\) and \(d\).  Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the angle bisector theorem, but we need more information about the lengths of the sides or the angles to proceed directly. However, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles formed by the diagonal \(AC\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(AB\) and \(CD\) to line \(AD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) is the same as \(CD = d\).

The area of the trapezoid is 42, so:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times d
\]
\[
84 = (a + b) \times d
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2 } \times a \times d
\]

Since \([\triangle ACD]\) is one of the two triangles that make up the trapezoid and the sum of their areas is 42, and knowing that the height \(d\) is the same for both triangles, we can conclude that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height is the same and the base \(AD\) is part of the total base sum \(a + b\) which is split in the trapezoid.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply to clear the fraction:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying the left and right sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
    \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Dividing both sides by -19, we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.

Therefore, the solution to the equation is:

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation for multiplying ratios. The operation is defined as follows:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

We are given the ratios \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). We need to find the result of the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\).

Let's identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given ratios:
- \(m = 7\)
- \(n = 30\)
- \(p = 10\)
- \(q = 21\)

Now, substitute these values into the operation formula:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\ ]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times 0.7 = 49

Therefore, the result of the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties and the random placement of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on a circle.

1. **Total Number of Arrangements**:
   The points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be arranged in any order around the circle. The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to consider that rotating the points around the circle does not create a new arrangement. Therefore, the actual number of distinct arrangements is \(3! = 6\).

2. **Condition for Intersection**:
   Two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged in such a way that one pair of points is separated by the other pair when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate between the two pairs of points. For example, the  arrangement \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) will result in intersecting chords.

3. **Counting Favorable Arrangements**:
   There are exactly 2 favorable arrangements for each set of 4 points (the alternating arrangements). For example, if the points are labeled in the order they appear on the circle as \(A, C, B, D\), then the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect. If we consider the other alternating arrangement \(A, D, B, C\), the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will also intersect. Therefore, for each of the 6 possible arrangements of the points, there are 2 favorable arrangements out of the 6 possible ways to order the points.

4. **Calculating the Probability**:
   Since there are 2 favorable arrangements out of the 6 possible ways to order the points, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the sector formed by the angle \(\angle ADC\) in a circle with a radius of 1 unit and then compare it to the area of the entire circle.

1. **Calculate the area of the entire circle:**
   The area \(A\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. Here, the radius \(r = 1\), so the area of the entire circle is:
   \[
   A = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the sector:**
   The problem states that the area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the entire circle. Therefore, the area of the sector is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{5}{12} \times \pi = \frac{5\pi}{12}
   \]

3. **Find the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The area of a sector of a circle is proportional to the angle  it subtends at the center of the circle. The full circle is \(360^\circ\) or \(2\pi\) radians. If the area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the entire circle, then the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the full circle. Therefore, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
   \[
   \angle ADC = \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ
   \]

Thus, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{150}\).```

   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.
   
   Here, the radius \( r = 3 \) cm and the height \( h = 8 \) cm. Substituting these values in, we get:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle sum and difference identities for sine, as well as the properties of the arcsine function.

First, let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We already know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5 \). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta  = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{1 0}
\]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \((a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2\):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{9}{100}
\]

 Thus, the value of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{100}}

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 repub like and 6 demokrata, we need to consider the different scenarios for the composition of the committee. The committee can have anywhere from 1 to 5 members from the 8 repub like and the rest from the 6 demokrata.

We will use the binomial coefficient, denoted as \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. The binomial coefficient is calculated using the formula:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

We will consider each possible composition of the committee:

1. **1 repub like and 4 demokrata:**
\[
\binom{8}{1} \times \binom{6}{4} = 8 \times 15 = 120
\]

2. **2 repub like and 3 demokrata:**
\[

\]

3. **3 repub like and 2 demokrata:**
\[
\binom{8}{3} \times \binom{6}{2} = 56 \times 15 = 840

\[

Next, we use the known result for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2 in a geometric progression. Specifically, for \(n = 4\), we have:

Therefore, the expression evaluates to:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the side \(BC\) of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and the given conditions. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle.

First, let's denote the length of \(AB\) and \(AC\) as \(x\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\), \(AM\) is also the median and the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Therefore, \(BM = MC = \frac{BC}{2}\).

We are given that \(AM = 11\) and \(AD = 10\), so \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Now, let's use the fact that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude. In the right triangle \(AMC\), we have :
\[AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 \implies x^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 \implies x^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2.\]

Next, we need to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). This angle condition suggests that we can use trigonometric identities or geometric properties, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(D\) lies on \(AM\) and the given lengths.

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we can use the fact that the ratio of the segments created by the angle bisector in a triangle is equal to the ratio of the other two sides. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the triangle is symmetric and the given lengths.

By the properties of the isosceles triangle and the given lengths, we can deduce that \(BC = 2 \times BM\). Since \(BM = \sqrt{x^2 - 121}\), we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies the given conditions .

By the properties of the triangle and the given lengths, we can deduce that the length of \(BC\) is \(12\). This is because the triangle is symmetric and the given lengths satisfy the angle condition.

Therefore, the length of \(BC\) is \(\boxed{12}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).```

"To determine the median of the 27 integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(3^7\):**
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
   \]

2. **Identify the median of 27 integers:**
   The median of a set of 27 integers is the 14th smallest number in the ordered list of these integers. This is because there are 13 numbers smaller than the median and 13 numbers larger than the median.

3. **Sum of the integers:**
   The sum of the 27 integers is 2187. If the integers are all equal, the sum would be \(27 \times \text{median}\). Therefore, we can find the median by dividing the sum by 27:
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Since the sum of the integers is exactly \(27  \times 81\), all 27 integers must be 81. Therefore, the 14th smallest number in the list is 81.

Thus, the median of the 27 integers is \(\boxed{81}\).```python
# Python code to verify the calculation
sum_of_integers = 3**7
number_of_integers = 27

"1. **Define the inequality:**
   \[
   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

2. **Consider the function \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \):**
   - This function is even, meaning \( f(x) = f(-x) \).
   - Therefore, we only need to analyze \( x \geq 0 \) and then extend the results to \( x < 0 \).

3. **Find the minimum value of \( f(x) \):**
   - Compute the first derivative of \( f(x) \):
     \[
     f'(x) = 4x^3 + 8x
     \]
   - Set the first derivative to zero to find critical points:
     \[
     4x^3 + 8x = 0 \implies 4x(x^2 + 2) = 0 \implies x = 0 \quad (\text{since } x^2 + 2 > 0 \text{ for all } x)

   - Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the critical point \( x = 0 \):
     \ [
     f(0) = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0

   - Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial and \( f''(x) = 12x^2 + 8 \) (which is always positive), \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at \( x = 0 \).

4. **Analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \):**
   \[
   \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} x^4 + 4x^2 = \infty

5. **Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \):**
   - Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
     \[
     y^2 + 4y < 21
     \]
   - Rearrange and solve the quadratic inequality:
     \[
     y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0

   - Find the roots of the quadratic equation \( y^2  + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
     \]
     \[
     y = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -7

   - Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), we only consider \( y = 3 \):

"Given the equations:

\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum identity:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \implies s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p.
\]
We also have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p\) into the identity for the sum of cubes, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\ [
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
We also have the third equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12 \implies s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.
\]
Since \(xyz = 4\), we have:
\[
s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \implies sp - 12 = 12 \implies sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
s^3 - 3sp = -8,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(sp = 24\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
s^3 -  3 \cdot 24 = -8 \implies s^3 - 72 = -8 \implies s^3 = 64 \implies s = 4.
\]
Since \(sp = 24\), we have:
\[
4p = 24 \implies p = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine the number ofmu≈°kih koris Í≤ΩÌóòs for each of the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades, we need to calculate the number ofmu≈°kih korisÊúüÊùÉ for each grade based on the given percentages and the information that the total number ofmu≈°kih and‰ÑÄ usage is equal.

First, let's calculate the total number ofmu≈°kih and/client usage combined for the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. Since the number ofmu≈°kih and passionately usage is equal, the total number ofmu≈°kih and„Ç™„É™ usage for each grade is the same. We'll use the 9th grade data to find this total.

The total number ofmu≈°kih and currentNode usage for the 9th grade is:
\[ 41.1\% + 39.4\% = 80.5\% \]
Since the total number ofmu≈°kih and –í–µ–¥—å usage for the 9th grade is equal, we can use the percentages to find the actual numbers. Let \( T \) be the total number ofmu≈°kih and|| ◊ó◊ô◊ô usage for the 9 th grade. Then:
\[ 0.805T = 700 \]
Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{700}{0.805} \approx 869.02 \]
So, the total number ofmu≈°kih and||‚áü usage for the 9th grade is approximately 869. Since the number ofmu≈°kih and||| usage is equal, the actual numbers are:
\[ \text{ mu≈°kih usage} = 0.411 \times 869 \approx 357 \]
\[ \text{| || usage} = 0.394 \times 869 \approx 342 \]

Now, we use these totals to find the number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage for the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. The total number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage for these grades is:
\[ 869 - 357 - 342 = 170 \]
This 170 is the sum of the mu≈°ki h and| || usage for the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. Since the total number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage is the same for each grade, we divide 170 by 3:
\[ \text{Number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage per grade} = \frac{170}{3} \approx 56.67 \]

Now, we calculate the number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage for each grade:
\[ \text{10th grade} = 0.344 \times 56.67 \approx 19.44 \]
\[ \text{11th grade} = 0.206 \times 56.67 \approx 11.66 \]
\[ \text{12th grade} = 0.116 \times 56.67 \approx 6.58 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[ \text{10th grade} = 20 \]
\[ \text{11th grade} = 12 \]
\[ \text{ 12th grade} = 7 \]

So, the number ofmu≈°kih and| || usage for each grade is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative (i.e., \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\)), and it equals zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which happens when \(x = \pm 9\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), and it equals zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) means that the numerator must be positive and the denominator must be negative,  or the numerator must be negative and the denominator must be positive. However, since \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.

So, we need to find where \(|x^2 - 81| > 0\) and \(x^2 - 36x < 0\).

1. The inequality \(|x^2 - 81| > 0\) is true for all \(x \neq \pm 9\).
2. The inequality \(x^2 - 36x < 0\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36) < 0\). This inequality holds when \(0 < x < 36\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the side of a square that can fit within a figure consisting of a square and a semicircle on each side.

First, let's analyze the given figure. The figure consists of a square with a semicircle on each of its four sides. The total length of the perimeter of the figure, excluding the sides of the square that are covered by the semicircles, is 400 meters. This means the sum of the lengths of the four semicircles is 400 meters.

The circumference of a full circle is given by \(2\pi r\), so the circumference of a semicircle is \(\pi r\). Since there are four semicircles, the total length of the curved parts is \(4 \times \pi r = 4\pi r\). Therefore, we have:
\[4\pi r = 400\]
Solving for \(r\), we get:
\[r = \frac{400}{4\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}\]

The side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is \(2r\).  Substituting the value of \(r\), we get:
\[2r = 2 \times \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi}\]

The area of the square is the side length squared:
\[\left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{40000}{\pi^2}\]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we can calculate the area:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the piecewise definition of \( f(x) \) separately for each case.

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is within the interval \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x  \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic equation:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = -1 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Thus, there are no solutions in the interval \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, the only solution for \( f^{-1}(0) \) is:
\[
f^{-1}(0) = 3 
\]

### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the interval \( x \leq 3 \), this is a valid solution.

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   We need to solve this cubic equation. First, check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \).

   Testing \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1 ) = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

   Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6 \quad (\text{a root})
   \]
   Therefore, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We can conclude that there are no solutions in the interval \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution for \( f^{-1}(6) \) is:
\[
f^{-1}(6) = -3
\]

### Summing the Inverses

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the vertex of the octahedron that is opposite to the vertex from which the distances to \( P \) are given (3, 7, 8, 9, and 11).

First, let's understand the structure of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be considered as the vertices of two pyramids with a square base joined at the base.

Let's place the octahedron in a coordinate system. The vertices of the octahedron can be given as:
\[ (1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, -1) \]

We are given the distances from point \( P \) to 5 of these vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's assume the distances from  \( P \) to the vertices \((1, 0, 0)\), \((-1, 0, 0)\), \((0, 1, 0)\), \((0, -1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, 1)\) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively. The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0, 0, -1)\) is what we need to find.

The distance from a point \( P = (x, y, z) \) to a point \( (a, b, c) \) is given by:
\[ \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2} \]

So, we have:
\[ \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3 \]
\[ \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7 \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8 \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + (y  + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9 \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11 \]

We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0, 0, -1)\), which is:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2} \]

By squaring the given distances, we get the following equations:
\[ (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \]
\[ (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \]
\[ x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64 \]
\[ x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121 \]

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[ (x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 40 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \ ]
\[ x = 10 \]

By subtracting the third equation from the fourth, we get:
\[ (x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2) - (x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2) = 17 \]
\[ 4y = 17 \]
\[ y = \frac{17}{4} \]

By subtracting the first equation from the fifth, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 - ((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 112 \]
\[ 2x - 2z + 1 = 112 \]
\[ 20 - 2z + 1 = 112 \]
\[ -2z = 91 \]
\[ z = -\frac{91}{2} \]

Now, we can find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0, 0, -1)\):
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + \left (\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{91}{2} + 1\right)^2} = \sqrt{100 + \frac{289}{16} + \left(-\frac{89}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{100 + \frac{289}{16} + \frac{7921}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1600 + 289 + 31684}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{33573}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{33573}}{4} = 13 \]

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the vertex opposite to \( P \) is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much more money Jenine makes compared to Jack by selling the same number of oranges. Let's denote the number of oranges sold by \( n \).

First, we calculate the revenue Jenine makes from selling \( n \) oranges. Since each orange from Jenine's softball weighs 200 grams and each orange from Jack's baseball weighs 150 grams, the weight difference per orange is:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \text{ grams} \]
So, for every 50 grams more than Jack, Jenine makes an additional 50 grams worth of oranges. If Jenine sells \( n \) oranges, she makes:
\[ 50n \text{ grams more than Jack} \]

Next, we need to determine the value of these extra 50 grams of oranges. Since the problem does not specify the value of each gram of oranges, we assume that the value is proportional to the weight. Therefore, the extra money Jenine makes is proportional to the extra weight of oranges she sells. Since the extra weight is 50 grams per orange, and she sells \( n \) oranges, the extra money she makes is:
 \[ 50n \text{ grams} \times \text{value per gram} \]

However, since the problem asks for the extra money in grams (assuming the value per gram is 1 gram for simplicity), the extra money Jenine makes is simply:
\[ 50n \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the extra money Jenine makes is:
\[ \boxed{50n} \] grams. If we need the answer in dollars, we would need the value per gram, but since the problem does not specify, the answer remains in terms of grams.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of roks that can be placed on the chessboard according to the given rules. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Rules:**
   - No two rooks can be placed in the same row or column.
   - Each rook must be able to see all other rooks, meaning no rook can be directly in front of, behind, to the left of, or to the right of another rook.
   - No two rooks can see each other diagonally.

2. **Analyzing the Constraints:**
   - The rooks must be placed such that no two rooks are in the same row or column. This means we can place at most one rook per row and one rook per column.
   - The condition that no two rooks can see each other diagonally means that they must be placed in such a way that no two rooks are on the same diagonal. This implies that the rooks must be placed in a way that they do not share the same diagonal.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Roks:**
   - The smallest number of rooks that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard  such that no two rooks are in the same row or column and no two rooks are on the same diagonal is 8. This is because we can place one rook in each row and each column, and there will be exactly one rook per diagonal.

Therefore, the minimum number of rooks that can be placed on the chessboard according to the given rules is \(\boxed{8}\).```

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[ 2x - y - 2 = 0 \]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[ d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 +  (-1)^2}} \]

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\[ d = \frac{|12 + 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[ d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"To determine the cost of one loboke in cents, we start by expressing the total costs in cents. The first person paid \$1.24, which is 124 cents, and the second person paid \$1.82, which is 182 cents.

Let's denote the cost of one loboke as \( L \) cents and the cost of one polish gummy as \( G \) cents. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. \( nL + mG = 124 \)
2. \( pL + qG = 182 \)

where \( n, m, p, \) and \( q \) are non-negative integers representing the number of loboke and gummy each person bought. Since we need to find the cost of one loboke, we will look for a common factor or a pattern in the equations.

First, let's find the difference between the two amounts paid:
\[ 182 - 124 = 58 \]

This difference tells us that the difference in cost between the two transactions is 58 cents. This difference must be a combination of the costs of the loboke and  the gummy. Since the cost of one lollipop is the same regardless of how many were bought, the difference in the number of lollipops bought must be an integer. Let's assume \( n = p + k \) and \( m = q \) where \( k \) is the number of additional lollipops bought by the second person compared to the first person. Then the difference in cost can be expressed as:
\[ kL = 58 \]

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, \( L \) must be a divisor of 58. The divisors of 58 are 1, 2, 29, and 58. We need to check which of these values for \( L \) makes sense in the context of the original equations.

If \( L = 29 \) cents, then:
\[ k = \frac{58}{29} = 2 \]

This means the second person bought 2 more lollipops than the first person. Let's check if this value of \( L \) works in the original equations. If \( L = 29 \), then:
\[ n \cdot 29 + mG =  124 \]
\[ (n + 2) \cdot 29 + qG = 182 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (n + 2) \cdot 29 + qG - (n \cdot 29 + mG) = 182 - 124 \]
\[ 2 \cdot 29 + (q - m)G = 58 \]
\[ 58 + (q - m)G = 58 \]
\[ (q - m)G = 0 \]

This implies that \( q = m \), which means the number of gummy bought by the first person is the same as the number of gummy bought by the second person, and the second person bought 2 more lollipops than the first person. This is consistent with the difference in cost being 58 cents.

Therefore, the cost of one lollipop is \( 29 \) cents. The answer is:

"To determine how to write the number \(\frac{137}{500}\) with the correct sign for the decimal point, we can perform the division of 137 by 500.

First, let's convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 137 by 500:

\[ \frac{137}{500} = 137 \div 500 \]

We can simplify this division by recognizing that 500 is equivalent to \(5 \times 100\). So, we can rewrite the division as:

\[ 137 \div 500 = 137 \div (5 \times 100) = \left(137 \div 5\right) \div 100 \]

Now, let's divide 137 by 5:

\[ 137 \div 5 = 27.4 \]

Next, we divide 27.4 by 100:

\[ 27.4 \div 100 = 0.274 \]

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{5 00}\) is 0.274. Therefore, the correct way to write the number is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is closer to the center \( O \) than to any of the vertices \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \), we need to analyze the geometric conditions that define the region where \( P \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex.

First, let's consider the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \( ABCD \). Assume \( A = (-a, b) \), \( B = (a, b) \), \( C = (a, -b) \), and \( D = (-a, -b) \). The center \( O \) of the rectangle is at \( (0, 0) \).

A point \( P = (x, y) \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex if the distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is less than the distance from \( P \) to any of the vertices. The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is given by:
\[ OP = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( A \)  is:
\[ PA = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( B \) is:
\[ PB = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( C \) is:
\[ PC = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( D \) is:
\[ PD = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]

For \( P \) to be closer to \( O \) than to any vertex, the inequalities \( OP < PA \), \( OP < PB \), \( OP < PC \), and \( OP < PD \) must all hold. However, due to the symmetry of the rectangle, we only need to consider one of these inequalities, and the others will follow by symmetry.

Consider the inequality \( OP < PA \):
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
 \[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 > 0 \]
\[ ax - by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0 \]

Similarly, for the other vertices, we get:
\[ ax - by - \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < 0 \]
\[ -ax - by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < 0 \]
\[ -ax - by - \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0 \]

These inequalities describe four lines that form a smaller rectangle centered at \( O \) with half the side lengths of the original rectangle. The area of this smaller rectangle is one-fourth the area of the original rectangle.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller  rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the probability is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{4}} \]```

"To find the value of \( 54 \mod 6 \), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6.

1. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   54 \div 6
   \]
   This division can be done directly:
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]

2. **Check for the Remainder**:
   Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0. We can verify this by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder:
   \[
   54 = 6 \times 9 + 0
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   The remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. Therefore,
   \[
   54 \mod 6 = 0
   \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).```python

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function:

\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.70 \).
 - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how much money the four girls have in total and how much they can convert to dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the amounts each girl has to find the total amount of money.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars and cents to simply cents.
3. Determine the maximum amount they can convert to dollars and the remaining cents.

First, let's add the amounts each girl has:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add them step by step:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
 \]

Now, we need to determine how much they can convert to dollars and the remaining cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we divide the total cents by 100:

\[
12659 \div 100 = 126.59
\]

This means they can convert \$126 to dollars and have 59 cents remaining. Therefore, the maximum amount they can convert to dollars and still have some cents left is \$126.

The amount of cents they can convert to dollars is:

\[
12659 - (126 \times 100) = 12659 - 12600 = 59
\]

So, the maximum amount of cents they can convert to dollars is:

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this is also the common sum \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \ ):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the third row:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
And the common sum \( S \) is:
\[
2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15

So, the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is indeed 15.

"To determine how many steps smaller the distance Jim hopped is compared to the distance Martha ran, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim hopped. Jim hopped along the diagonal of the rectangular field. For a rectangle with length \( l \) and width \( w \), the length of the diagonal \( d \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Given that the length \( l = 400 \) steps and the width \( w = 300 \) steps, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \]

So, Jim hopped 500 steps.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha ran. Martha ran the perimeter of the rectangular field. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[  P = 2l + 2w \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times 400 + 2 \times 300 \]
\[ P = 800 + 600 \]
\[ P = 1400 \]

So, Martha ran 1400 steps.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha ran and the distance Jim hopped:
\[ \text{Difference} = 1400 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 \]

Therefore, Jim hopped 900 steps smaller than Martha ran. The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, which satisfies the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the complex roots \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we will find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2 }{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). Expanding this product, we get:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1

"To determine the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we can use the given side lengths and apply Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

In this problem, the sides of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) are \(AB = 6\), \(BC = 5\), and \(CA = 6\). First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{6 + 5 + 6}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
\]

Now, we can substitute \(s\), \(a = 6\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 6\) into Heron's formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{8.5(8.5 - 6)(8.5 -  5)(8.5 - 6)} = \sqrt{8.5 \times 2.5 \times 3.5 \times 2.5}
\]

We can simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{8.5 \times 2.5 \times 3.5 \times 2.5} = \sqrt{153.125}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \(AB = CA = 6\) and \(BC = 5\). We can split \( \triangle ABC \) into two right triangles by drawing the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), which we will call \(D\). This altitude will bisect \(BC\) into two segments of length 2.5 each. Now we have two right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of 6 and one leg of 2.5. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the altitude \(AD\):

\[
AD = \sqrt{6^2 - 2.5^2} = \sqrt{36 - 6. 25} = \sqrt{29.75} = \sqrt{\frac{119}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{119}}{2}
\]

The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AD = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{119}}{2} = \frac{5 \sqrt{119}}{4}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula involving the sides and the sine of the included angle. For \( \triangle ABC \), we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \times \sin(\angle BAC)
\]

We can find \(\sin(\angle BAC)\) using the Law of Cosines. First, we find \(\cos(\angle BAC)\):

\[
\cos(\angle BAC) = \frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 \times AB \times AC } = \frac{6^2 + 6^2 - 5^2}{2 \times 6 \times 6} = \frac{36 + 36 - 25}{72} = \frac{47}{72}
\]

Then, we find \(\sin(\angle BAC)\) using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\):

\[
\sin(\angle BAC) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{47}{72}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2209}{5184}} = \sqrt{\frac{2975}{5184}} = \frac{\sqrt{2975}}{72} = \frac{5\sqrt{119}}{72}
\]

Now, we can find the area:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 \times \frac{5\sqrt{119}}{72} = \frac{180\sqrt{119}} {144} = \frac{5\sqrt{119}}{4}
