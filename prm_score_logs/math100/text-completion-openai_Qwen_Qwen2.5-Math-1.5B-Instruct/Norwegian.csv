"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

1. The triangle \(DEF\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(F\).
2. The length of \(EF\) is given as 7.
3. The sine of angle \(D\) is given as 0.7.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DE\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the value of \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c \). The steps are as follows:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta}  \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
    \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the complex numbers z and c
z = 2 + sp.sqrt(2) - (3 + 3*sp.sqrt(2))*sp.I
c = 2 - 3*sp.I

# Translate z so that c is at the origin
z_translated = z - c

# Rotate z' by pi/4 radians counterclockwise
rotation_factor = sp.exp(sp.I*sp.pi/4)
z_rotated = z_translated * rotation_factor

# Translate back to the original position
w = z_rotated + c

# Simplify the result
w_simplified = sp.simplify(w)

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by factoring 242 into its prime factors. 

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121. \]
So, we can write:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121. \]

Next, we need to factor 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11. \]
So, we can write:
\[ 121 = 11^2. \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2. \]

Now, we can take the square root of both sides:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}. \]

Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\),  we get:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}. \]

Since \(\sqrt{11^2} = 11\), we have:
\[ \sqrt{242} = 11 \sqrt{2}. \]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To solve the problem of finding the number of ways that 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit:**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super person."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units around the table (the block of 3 and the other 5 individuals).

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table:**
   When arranging \( n \) units around a round table, the number of distinct arrangements is \((n-1)!\). This is because one unit can be fixed to break the rotational symmetry, and then the remaining units can be arranged linearly.
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the 3 people within the block:**
   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results:**
    To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with the given condition, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within the block.
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the total number of ways that 8 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).```python

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is zero. Let's simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(x^{-2}\right)^k
\]

S implify the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the exponents of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

Simplify the exponent of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5 }{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10)^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these values:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

Thus, the constant term in the expansion is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, let's substitute \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).

1. Calculate \(n + 2\):
   \[
   n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
   \]

2. Calculate \(n + 4\):
   \[
   n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
   \]

3. Calculate \(n + 6\):
   \[
   n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Now, we need to find the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6 ) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Next, calculate the product step by step:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) should be the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations :
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). Now, we need to find the value of \(x + y\):
\[

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{5}\).``````

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine its vertical and horizontal asymptotes, and then find the sum of the constants associated with these asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at those points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to determine the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.  The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these together gives:
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).```

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.

\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now  the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this identity into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks tilsvarer a vekten av a squig. Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. The problem states that ""Pi treeksveier like mye som tre squigs und en goolee."" This means that a treek_valder like a mye som Ambassador squigs und goolee.
2. The problem also states that ""Hvertall treeks und en goolee er like nett med at en squig."" This means that a treek_valder und en goolee is like a nett med at an squig.
3. We need to find out how many treeks tilsvarer a vekten av a squig.

From the second statement, we can infer that a treek_valder und en goolee is like a nett med at an squig. This means that a treek_valder und en goolee is the same as a squig. Therefore, a squig is equivalent to a treek_valder and an goolee.

Since a treek_valder und an goolee is the same as a squig, we can conclude that one  treek_valder tilsvarer a vekten av a squig.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{1}\).```

```<s>2. There are 5.0 x 10^23 gas molecules in a sample of gas at 25 degrees Celsius and 1.00 bar. If this sample of gas is expanded at constant temperature to a volume of 22.4 liters, what is the new pressure of the gas?```

To solve this problem, we can use the ideal gas law, which states that \(PV = nRT\), where \(P\) is the pressure, \(V\) is the volume, \(n\) is the number of moles of gas, \(R\) is the ideal gas constant, and \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The conversion is given by \(T(K) = T(C) + 273.15\). So, for 25 degrees Celsius, the temperature in Kelvin is:
\[ T = 25 + 273.15 =","[1, '1']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2 
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combining all these terms, we have:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12 = 12\)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From the fifth equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substituting \(a = -3\) into the second equation, we solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in the other equations:

For the third equation:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For the fourth equation:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied , so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylinder by \( r \) meters and the height of the cylinder by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that the volume of water being added to the tank per unit time is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, and the rate at which the water level is rising is 4 meters per unit time. The rate of change of the volume of water with respect to time is equal to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (which is \(\pi r^2\)) times the rate of change of the height of the water. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(\ pi\):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is \(\sqrt{5}\) meters. The final answer is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{hvis } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{hvis } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). This part of the function is a parabola that opens upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = 0\), but since we are considering \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a^3\).

Next, let's consider the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\).  This part of the function is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the left, \(f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a\), must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the function for \(x \geq a\), which is \(a^3\). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
To solve this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where the product is less than or equal to zero.  The roots of the equation are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We can test the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\):

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), the product is positive.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), the product is negative.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), the product is negative.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), the product is positive.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the function intersects each horizontal line at least once, the largest value is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).```

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we can rewrite \( x^2 - 10x \) as:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y  \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we can rewrite \( y^2 + 6y \) as:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
becomes
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
or
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
or
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\) and solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1  \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve for the value of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\).  This simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda\), which is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left side, we get :
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \neq 0, 1\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), we need to check the discriminant and the nature of the roots of this cubic equation. However, a simpler approach is to consider the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points.

The function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) is a quadratic function that opens downwards and has a maximum at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). The value of \(f\) at this maximum is:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{2 }\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4}(2 - \lambda).
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x \neq 0, 1\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), the maximum value of \(f\) must be greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\) and less than 1. This gives us the condition:
\[
\frac{\lambda^2}{4}(2 - \lambda) > \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\lambda^2}{4}(2 - \lambda) < 1.
\]
Simplifying the first inequality:
\[
\lambda^2 (2 - \lambda) > 2 \implies 2\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 > 2 \implies \lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + 2 < 0.
\]
The second inequality is always true for \(\lambda \leq 4\). Checking the values, we find that the inequality \(\lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + 2 < 0\) holds for \(\lambda = 2\ ). For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2,
\]
and
\[
f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 - 4x^3) = 2(2x - 2x^2) = 4x - 4x^2 = x.
\]
Thus, \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0, 1\) when \(\lambda = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).```

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)  \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B = \cos (A - B).
\]
Applying these, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
 \[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)  \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying these, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, we substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
 \]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) and \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we see that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Since \(\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ\) and \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\),  we see that the numerator and the denominator are the same, so:
\[
\tan \theta = 1.

The angle whose tangent is 1 is \(45^\circ\), so the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"为了找到函数 \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值，其中 \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \)，我们首先分析函数及其行为。

首先，观察到函数 \( f(x, y) \) 是对称的，意味着 \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)。这表明最大值可能发生在 \( x = y \) 时。

让我们在 \( x = y \) 的情况下评估函数：
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]

现在，我们需要找到 \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 在 \( -1 \le x \le 1 \) 范围内的最大值。为此，我们对 \( g(x) \) 求导并找到它的临界点。

\( g(x) \) 的导数为：
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2 } + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]

将导数设为零以找到临界点：
\[ \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

我们在这些临界点以及端点 \( x = -1, 1 \) 处评估 \( g(x) \)：
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

因此，\( g(x) \) 的最大值是 1，这发生在 \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \) 和 \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)。

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) in 3D space:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|
\]

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4  \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}
\]

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{180}
\]

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Now, we can find the area of the triangle \(OAB\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\). The number \(\phi\) satisfies the quadratic equation \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\), and its reciprocal \(\frac{1}{\phi}\) also satisfies the same equation. Therefore, \(z\) must be a root of the quadratic equation \(z^2 - z - 1 = 0\). The roots of this equation are \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). Let's consider the case where \(z = \phi\). We know that \(\phi\) satisfies \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\). We can use this property to find powers of \(\phi\). Specifically, we need to find a pattern in the powers of \(\phi\).

 Let's compute the first few powers of \(\phi\):
\[
\phi^2 = \phi + 1,
\]
\[
\phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi(\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1,
\]
\[
\phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi(2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2,
\]
\[
\phi^5 = \phi \cdot \phi^4 = \phi(3\phi + 2) = 3\phi^2 + 2\phi = 3(\phi + 1) + 2\phi = 5\phi + 3.
\]
We observe that the coefficients of \(\phi\) and the constant terms are the Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, \(\phi^n = F_n \phi + F_{n-1}\), where \(F_n\) is the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number.

 Using this pattern, we can express \(\phi^{85}\) as:
\[
\phi^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84}.
\]
Similarly, \(\frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = \frac{1}{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}} = \frac{1}{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}} \cdot \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 (\phi + 1) - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85}  \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 (\phi + 1) - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2}.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2} = F_{85} \phi  + F_{84} + \phi - F_{84} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \frac{F_{85} \phi - F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 - F_{84}^2} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \phi - F_{84} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \phi - F_{84} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \phi - F_{84} = 2\phi.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\) is \(\boxed{2}\). The same result holds for \(z = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\). Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{2}\).}$$

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the medians and centroid of a triangle, as well as the properties of the line parallel to one side of the triangle and intersecting the other two sides.

First, let's recall that the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid \(G\), which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The centroid also divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area.

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of each of the six smaller triangles formed by the medians is:
\[
\frac{144}{6} = 24
\]

Now, consider the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\). This line intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the heights from \(A\) to \(MN\) and from \(A\) to \(BC\).

Since \(G\) is the  centroid, it divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). This means that the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \times 144 = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16

Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\boxed{16}\).```

4. **Number of bollers that are not in any hive:**
   Since the total number of bollers in the hives equals the total number of bollers, there are no bollers that are not in any hive. Therefore, the number of bollers that are not in any hive is:

"To determine if there are any positive integer solutions to the equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 100\) or \(x^2 - y^2 = 150\), we start by factoring each equation using the difference of squares formula, which states \(x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)\).

### Case 1: \(x^2 - y^2 = 100\)
We need to find pairs of integers \((a, b)\) such that \(a = x + y\) and \(b = x - y\) and \(ab = 100\). Additionally, since \(x\) and \(y\) are integers, \(a\) and \(b\) must have the same parity (both even or both odd). The factor pairs of 100 are:
\[
(1, 100), (-1, -100), (2, 50), (-2, -50), (4, 25), (-4, -25), (5, 20), (-5, -20), (10, 10), (-10, -10)
\]
 Among these, the pairs that have the same parity are:
\[
(2, 50), (-2, -50), (10, 10), (-10, -10)
\]
For each pair, we solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
1. For \((2, 50)\):
   \[
   x + y = 50 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = 2
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = 52 \implies x = 26\), and subtracting them gives \(2y = 48 \implies y = 24\). So, \((x, y) = (26, 24)\).
2. For \((-2, -50)\):
   \[
   x + y = -50 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = -2
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = -52 \implies x = -26\), and subtracting them gives \(2y = -48 \implies y = -24\). So, \((x , y) = (-26, -24)\).
3. For \((10, 10)\):
   \[
   x + y = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = 10
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = 20 \implies x = 10\), and subtracting them gives \(2y = 0 \implies y = 0\). So, \((x, y) = (10, 0)\).
4. For \((-10, -10)\):
   \[
   x + y = -10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = -10
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = -20 \implies x = -10\), and subtracting them gives \(2y = 0 \implies y = 0\). So, \((x, y) = (-10, 0)\).

Thus, the positive integer solutions to \(x^2 - y^2 = 100\) are \((26, 24)\) and \((10 , 0)\).

### Case 2: \(x^2 - y^2 = 150\)
We need to find pairs of integers \((a, b)\) such that \(a = x + y\) and \(b = x - y\) and \(ab = 150\). Again, \(a\) and \(b\) must have the same parity. The factor pairs of 150 are:
\[
(1, 150), (-1, -150), (2, 75), (-2, -75), (3, 50), (-3, -50), (5, 30), (-5, -30), (6, 25), (-6, -25), (10, 15), (-10, -15)
\]
Among these, the pairs that have the same parity are:
\[
(2, 75), (-2, -75), (6, 25), (-6, -25), (10, 15), (-10, -15)
\]
For each pair, we solve for \(x\) and \(y \):
1. For \((2, 75)\):
   \[
   x + y = 75 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = 2
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = 77 \implies x = 38.5\), which is not an integer.
2. For \((-2, -75)\):
   \[
   x + y = -75 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = -2
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = -77 \implies x = -38.5\), which is not an integer.
3. For \((6, 25)\):
   \[
   x + y = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = 6
   \]
   Adding these equations gives \(2x = 31 \implies x = 15.5\), which is not an integer.
4. For \((-6, -25)\):

"To determine for which values of \( n \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \).

First, we note that \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2. For \( 2^{24} \) to be a perfect \( n \)-th power, \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \). This is because if \( 2^{24} = k^n \), then \( k \) must be a power of 2, say \( k = 2^m \), and thus \( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \). This implies that \( 24 = mn \).

The divisors of 24 are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \). Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list . Therefore, the possible values for \( n \) are \( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \).

We can verify each of these values:
- For \( n = 2 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), so it is a perfect square.
- For \( n = 3 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \), so it is a perfect cube.
- For \( n = 4 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \), so it is a perfect fourth power.
- For \( n = 6 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 \), so it is a perfect sixth power.
- For \( n = 8 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 \), so it is a perfect eighth power.
- For \( n = 12 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \), so it is a perfect twelfth power.
- For \( n = 24  \), \( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \), so it is a perfect twenty-fourth power.

Thus, the values of \( n \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power are \( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \). Therefore, the answer is:

\[ y + 60 < 70 \]

- If \( y = 9 \), then \( x  = 75 - 2(9) - 5(15) = 75 - 18 - 75 = -18 \) (not possible since \( x \) must be non-negative).

"To determine the probability that the sum of the prime numbers picked by Paul and Jesse is even, we need to analyze the properties of prime numbers and the conditions under which their sum is even.

1. **Identify the properties of prime numbers:**
   - The only even prime number is 2.
   - All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Determine the possible outcomes:**
   - Paul and Jesse each pick a prime number.
   - There are two cases to consider:
     - Both Paul and Jesse pick even primes.
     - One picks an even prime and the other picks an odd prime.

3. **Analyze the sum in each case:**
   - **Case 1: Both Paul and Jesse pick the even prime (2).**
     - Sum = 2 + 2 = 4 (even).
   - **Case 2: One picks the even prime (2) and the other picks an odd prime.**
     - Sum = 2 + \text{(odd prime)} = \text{odd}.
   - **Case 3: Both Paul and Jesse pick odd primes.**
     - Sum = \text{odd prime} + \text{odd prime} = \text{even}.

4.  **Calculate the probabilities:**
   - There are 4 prime numbers less than 10: 2, 3, 5, 7.
   - Paul can pick any of these 4 primes.
   - Jesse can also pick any of these 4 primes.
   - Total number of possible outcomes = \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

5. **Count the favorable outcomes:**
   - **Case 1: Both pick 2.**
     - (2, 2) - 1 outcome.
   - **Case 3: Both pick an odd prime (3, 5, 7).**
     - (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 7), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 7) - 9 outcomes.

6. **Sum the favorable outcomes:**
   - Total favorable outcomes = 1 (from Case 1) + 9 (from Case 3) = 10.

7. **Calculate the probability:**
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number  of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}

Thus, the probability that the sum of the prime numbers picked by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{8}}\).```

"To determine the value of \( b \) for the point \((a, b)\) on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\).
2. Simplify the equation to solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution. Since \( a = 4 \), we replace \( x \) with 4 in the equation:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Now, we need to isolate \( b \). We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

"To find the total area of the shape, we need to calculate the areas of the two regions separately and then sum them up. The shape consists of two right triangles.

1. **Identify the vertices of the triangles:**
   - The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
   - The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

2. **Calculate the area of the first triangle:**
   - The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
   - The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.
   - The area of a triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - Therefore, the area of the first triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4  = 4\) square units.

3. **Calculate the area of the second triangle:**
   - The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.
   - The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.
   - The area of the second triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6\) square units.

"To determine the smallest positive multiple of 450, we need to understand the properties of multiples of 450. A multiple of 450 is any number that can be expressed in the form \(450k\) where \(k\) is an integer. The smallest positive integer is 1, so the smallest positive multiple of 450 is \(450 \times 1 = 450\).

Let's verify this step-by-step:
1. Identify the smallest positive integer, which is 1.
2. Multiply 450 by 1 to get the smallest positive multiple of 450.
3. Calculate \(450 \times 1 = 450\).

Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 is \(\boxed{450}\). The reference to "" nuller��和 fields"" is not relevant to the problem of finding the smallest positive multiple of 450.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the bulsing door is on a floor that is both a room number and a floor number in the My Anton's room. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the possible room and floor numbers:**
   - The room numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - The floor numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2. **Determine the total number of possible combinations:**
   - There are 5 possible room numbers and 5 possible floor numbers.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible combinations of room and floor numbers is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

3. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   - The favorable outcomes are the combinations where the room number is the same as the floor number.
   - These combinations are: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5).

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the denominator.
2. Convert the fraction to a decimal.
3. Sum the digits of the decimal representation.

### Step 1: Simplify the denominator
The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite this as:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]
So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

### Step 2: Convert the fraction to a decimal
To convert \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605.\]
The  decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\).

### Step 3: Sum the digits of the decimal representation
The decimal \(0.00021605\) has the digits \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). We sum these digits:
\[0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14.\]

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).```

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), and \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
This can be grouped as:
 \[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(x-y) - \cos(x+y)]\), we can simplify each pair:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}, \quad \sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}.
\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\left(\frac{1 - \cos 40 ^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \left(\frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\right).
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\). We also know that \(\cos 20^\circ = \sin 70^\circ\). Therefore, the product is:
\[
\left(\frac{1 - \sin 50^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \sin 10^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \left(\frac{1 + \sin 70^\circ}{2}\right).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) again, we have \(\sin 70^\circ = \cos 20^\ circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is:

"To determine the geometric shape described by the equation \( z = c \), we need to analyze the given equation and understand what it represents in three-dimensional space.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf {b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
Now, substituting \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\), \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula, we get:

"To determine the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

We need to find the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). Let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Therefore, we have:
\[ f(\alpha) = 0, \quad f(\beta) = 0, \quad f(\gamma) = 0 \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we set \( f(x + 5) = 0 \). This implies:
\[ x + 5 = \alpha, \quad x + 5 = \beta, \quad x + 5 = \gamma \]

Solving for \( x \), we  get:
\[ x = \alpha - 5, \quad x = \beta - 5, \quad x = \gamma - 5 \]

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( \alpha - 5, \beta - 5, \gamma - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we sum these roots:
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) \]

This can be simplified as:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma - 15 \]

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{b}{a} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have:
\[ a = 1, \quad b = -49 \]

 Therefore:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite each term in the expression as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for cotangent in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}.
\]
So,
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
Thus, the expression now is:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

 We need to show that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 6\). To do this, we use the identity for the tangent of triple angles and some symmetry properties of the tangent function, but a simpler approach is to use known results or computational verification.

It is known (or can be derived using complex number identities or symmetry properties of the tangent function) that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 6.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 6 = 9.
\]
Therefore, the value of the original expression is:
\[

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles, excluding one angle, is \( 1070^\circ \). Let's denote the measure of the excluded angle by \( x \). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is:

\[
1070^\circ + x
\]

Since the sum of all interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( 180(n-2) \), we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

The measure of an interior angle of a polygon is always less than \( 180^\circ \) and greater than \( 0^\circ \). Therefore, \( x \) is an angle between \( 0^\circ \) and \( 180^\circ \). This means:

\[
1070 < 180(n-2) < 1250
\]

We can solve  this inequality step by step. First, divide all parts of the inequality by 180:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplify the fractions:

\[
5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
\]

Since \( n-2 \) must be an integer, the only possible value is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6 \implies n = 8
\]

To confirm, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of an 8-sided polygon:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^\circ
\]

Since the sum of all interior angles excluding one angle is \( 1070^\circ \), the excluded angle is:

\[
1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
\]

This is a valid angle measure, so our solution is correct. The number of sides of the polygon is:

"To solve for \( t \) such that \( t \) is an odd integer between 0 and 23 and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We need \( t \) and \( t + 2 \) to satisfy the congruence:
   \[
   t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. **Formulate the quadratic equation**: We need to solve the quadratic congruence:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Use the quadratic formula**: The quadratic formula for \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{p}
    \]
   Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}
   \]
   Simplify the discriminant:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Find the square root of 2 modulo 23**: We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
   \[
   x^2 \equiv 2 \ pmod{23}
   \]
   By trial or using the Legendre symbol, we find that:
   \[
   5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
   \]
   Thus, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

5. **Substitute back**: Substitute \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   t \equiv -1 \pm 5 \pmod{23}
   \]
   This gives us two potential solutions:
   \[
   t \equiv -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t \equiv -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
   \]

6. **Check for odd \( t \)**: We need \( t \) to be an odd integer. The solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Only \( t = 17 \) is odd.

Therefore, the solution is:

"To find the total overings area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total overings area of the cube.

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total  overings area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total overings area \( SA \) is:
\[ SA = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total overings area of the cube is:
\[ \boxed{6} \] square feet.```

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The radical conjugate of a number of the form \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to find the product of these two numbers:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\), so we have:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

 So the expression simplifies to:

"To determine if the two lines are parallel, we need to check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This shows that the direction vector of the second line is indeed a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, specifically, it is 2 times the first direction vector. Therefore, the two lines are parallel.

To find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, we can use the cross product of the two direction vectors. The cross product of \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\ ) is calculated as follows:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix}.
\]
Expanding the determinant, we get:
\[
\mathbf{i} \left( (-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18) \right) - \mathbf{j} \left( (2)(-4) - (-2)(4) \right) + \mathbf{k} \left( (2)(-18) - (-9)(4) \right).
\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses, we have:
\[
\mathbf{i} (36 - 36) - \mathbf{j} (-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k} (-36 + 36) = \mathbf{i} (0) - \mathbf{j} (0 ) + \mathbf{k} (0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This indicates that the direction vectors are not linearly independent, which is expected since they are parallel. However, the cross product of two parallel vectors is the zero vector, which means there is no non-zero vector perpendicular to both direction vectors. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a non-zero vector solution for a vector perpendicular to both direction vectors.

The correct interpretation of the problem, given the parallel nature of the lines, is that there is no non-zero vector perpendicular to both direction vectors. However, if we were to look for a vector that is perpendicular to one of the direction vectors, we could use either of the direction vectors for that purpose.

For the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), a vector perpendicular to it can be found by solving the equation \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = 0\). One such vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 2 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}\) because:
\[
9 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot (-9) + 0 \cdot (-2) = 18 - 18 + 0 = 0.
\]
Thus, a vector that is perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines is:

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units. Therefore, the integer coordinates that lie within the rectangle must satisfy the following conditions:

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We know  from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Also, since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\).

Substituting these vectors into our expression, we get:

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and then add the resulting vectors:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

First, let's denote the angles of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Let \(\angle CAD = \theta\). Because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\angle BAC = \theta\) and \(\angle CAD = \theta\), so \(\angle BAD = 2\theta\).

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:

   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, so the solution is verified.

Therefore, the solution is:

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the definition of the operation @ to the given fractions \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, the operation @ is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators \(m\) and \(p\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac {21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now we substitute this back into our expression:

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10}
\]

We can simplify this by dividing 70 by 10 and then multiplying by 7:

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7 \times 7 = 49
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) in a circle will intersect, we start by understanding the geometric properties of chords in a circle.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a circle with four points \(A, B, C, D\) chosen randomly on its circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Insight**:
   - Two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A, B, C, D\) are arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.
   - In other words, if we list the points in the order they appear when moving around the circle, the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if the order is either \(ACBD\) or \(ADBC\).

3. **Counting the Total Arrangements**:
   - The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\). This is because  we can fix one point and arrange the remaining 3 points in \(3!\) ways.
   - These 6 arrangements are: \(ACBD, ADB, BACD, BADC, CADB, CDAB\).

4. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements**:
   - Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will have the chords intersecting: \(ACBD\) and \(ADBC\).
   - Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

5. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements.
   - So, the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) in degrees. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the situation.

We have two circles with centers \( D \) and radii 1 and 2, respectively. The larger circle has radius 2 and the smaller circle has radius 1. The area of the larger circle is \( \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi \).

The total area of the shaded region is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the radii intersect the circle. The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord  connecting the points where the radii intersect the circle.

Let's denote the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) by \( \theta \) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \( \theta \) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle \( \triangle ADC \) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \( \theta \) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta
\]
The area of the triangle \( \triangle ADC \) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
Therefore , the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of the two circles:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta + \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = 2\theta - 2 \sin \theta + \frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]
We know that this area is equal to \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \):
\[
\frac{5}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Solving for \( \theta - \sin \theta \):
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3 }
\]
We need to find the value of \( \theta \) in degrees. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \) radians is approximately 120 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is:

"To determine how many spherical vases, each with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, are needed to fill a cylindrical tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the vases and the tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one spherical vase. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical vase, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm. Plugging in the value, we get:
\[
V_{\text{ vase}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.  For the cylindrical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:
\[
V_{\text{ tank}} = \pi (6)^2 (8) = \pi (36) (8) = 288 \pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

Now, to find out how many spherical vases are needed to fill the cylindrical tank, we divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one spherical vase:
\[
\text{Number of vases} = \frac{V_{\text{ tank}}}{V_{\text{ vase}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{36 \pi} = \frac{288}{36} = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of spherical vases needed to fill the cylindrical tank is \boxed{8}.```
The final answer is \boxed{8}.```ollary

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use some trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

Let:
\[
\alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \arcsin 0.5.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\sin \alpha = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = 0.5.
\]
We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the identities for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
We know \ (\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Now, we substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\ [
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}  = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]
Thus, the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\) is:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]
We use the difference of squares formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.
 \]
So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{9}{100}.

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem of determining how many ways we can select 5 popes from 8 republians and 6 demonstrationes such that at least one of the popes is a demonstratione, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to select 5 popes from the 14 available popes (8 republians and 6 demonstrationes).
2. Calculate the number of ways to select 5 popes that are all republians (i.e., no demonstrationes).
3. Subtract the number of ways to select 5 republians from the total number of ways to select 5 popes to get the number of ways to select 5 popes with at least one demonstratione.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to select 5 popes from 14.**

The number of ways to choose 5 popes from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

 \[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 popes that are all republians.**

The number of ways to choose 5 republians from 8 is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

**Step 3: Subtract the number of ways to select 5 republians from the total number of ways to select 5 popes.**

The number of ways to select 5 popes such that at least one is a demonstratione is:

 \[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} = 2002 - 56 = 1946

Thus, the number of ways to select 5 popes from 8 republians and 6 demonstrationes such that at least one of the popes is a demonstratione is \(\boxed{1946}\).```

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The product of the three numbers is 120.
2. The average of the three numbers is 24.

First, let's use the information about the average. The average of the three numbers is given by:
\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 72

Next, we use the information about the product. The product of the three numbers is given by:
\[
a \times b \times c = 120
\]

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are whole numbers and \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can start by testing possible values for \(a\).

Let's start with \(a = 5\):
 \[
b + c = 72 - 5 = 67

\[
b \times c = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Now, we need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(b + c = 67\) and \(b \times c = 24\). We can solve this using the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - (b+c)t + bc = 0

Substituting the known values:
\[
t^2 - 67t + 24 = 0

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -67\), and \(c = 24\):
\[
t = \frac{67 \pm \sqrt{67^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 24}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
t = \frac{67 \pm \sqrt{4489 - 96}} {2}

\[
t = \frac{67 \pm \sqrt{4393}}{2}

Since \(\sqrt{4393}\) is not a perfect square, \(b\) and \(c\) are not whole numbers when \(a = 5\). Therefore, \(a = 5\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 6\):

\[
b \times c = \frac{120}{6} = 20

Now, we need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(b + c = 66\) and \(b \times c = 20\). We can solve this using the quadratic equation:

Substituting the known values:
\[

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -66\), and \(c = 20\):

\[
t = \frac{66 \pm \sqrt{4356 - 80}}{2}

\[
t = \frac{66 \pm \sqrt{4276}}{2}

Since \(\sqrt{4276}\) is not a perfect square, \(b\) and \(c\) are not whole numbers when \(a = 6\). Therefore, \(a = 6\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 4\):
\[
b + c = 72 - 4 = 68

\[
b \times c = \frac{120}{4} = 30

Now, we need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(b + c = 68\) and \(b \times c  = 30\). We can solve this using the quadratic equation:

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -68\), and \(c = 30\):

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \(x\).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, we recognize that the expression inside the cube root can be simplified. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, we eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

 Now, we solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). We take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we select the positive solution:
\[
x = 66
\]

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{66}\).```

\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \ right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]
This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for our purposes, we will use it directly.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
-\frac{1}{16}.
\]

Therefore, the value of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{16}}.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the circumradius of triangle \(ABC\). Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the triangle.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AB = AC\), so triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\).
   - \(AM = 11\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\).
   - \(AD = 10\) and \(D\) is on \(AM\).
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

2. **Determine the coordinates of points:**
   - Place \(M\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Since \(AM = 11\), point \(A\) is at \((0, 11)\).
   - Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), point \(D\) is at \((0, 1)\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \(B\) and \(C\):**
   - Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(BC\) is horizontal, let \(B = (-b,  0)\) and \(C = (b, 0)\).
   - The length of \(BC\) is \(2b\).

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\):**
   \[
   AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2
   \]
   \[
   AB^2 = 11^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   AB^2 = 121 + b^2
   \]

5. **Use the given angle condition \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\):**
   - Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\).
   - Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

6. **Use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):**
   \[
   \frac{BC}{\sin(\angle BDC)} = 2R
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2b}{\sin(3\theta)} = 2R
   \]
   \[
   b = R \sin(3\theta)
   \]

7. **Use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABC\ ):**
   \[
   \frac{BC}{\sin(\angle BAC)} = 2R
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2b}{\sin(\theta)} = 2R
   \]
   \[
   b = R \sin(\theta)
   \]

8. **Equate the two expressions for \(b\):**
   \[
   R \sin(3\theta) = R \sin(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \sin(3\theta) = \sin(\theta)
   \]

9. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   \[
   3\theta = \theta + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 3\theta = \pi - \theta + 2k\pi
   \]
   \[
   2\theta = 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 4\theta = \pi + 2k\pi
   \]
   \[
   \theta = k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
    \]
   Since \(\theta\) must be an angle in a triangle, we take the smallest positive solution:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

10. **Find \(b\):**
    \[
    b = R \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = R \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
    \]

11. **Find \(AB\):**
    \[
    AB^2 = 121 + b^2
    \]
    \[
    AB^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{R\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2
    \]
    \[
    AB^2 = 121 + \frac{R^2}{2}
    \]
    \[
    AB = \sqrt{121 + \frac{R^2}{2}}
    \]

12. **Find the circumradius \(R\):**
    Since we know \(AB = AC\), we can use the fact that the circumradius \(R\) of an isosceles triangle can be found using the formula for the circumradius of a  triangle:
    \[
    R = \frac{a}{2 \sin(\theta)}
    \]
    where \(a\) is the length of the base and \(\theta\) is the angle opposite the base.

    Here, \(a = 2b = R\sqrt{2}\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\):
    \[
    R = \frac{R\sqrt{2}}{2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{4})}
    \]
    \[
    R = \frac{R\sqrt{2}}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
    \]
    \[
    R = R
    \]

Thus, the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[

\] 

The final answer is \(\boxed{11}\).``````

"To determine the median of the sums of 27 positive integers that add up to \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum**: The total sum of the 27 positive integers is given as \(3^7\). First, we calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]
   So, the sum of the 27 integers is 2187.

2. **Determine the median**: The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list (because the middle position in a list of 27 numbers is the 14th position).

3. **Assume the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible**: To find the median, we can assume that the 27 integers are as close to each other as possible. If we divide 2187 by 27, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2187}{27} = 81
   \]
   This means that if all  27 integers were 81, their sum would be 2187. In this case, all 27 integers would be 81, and the median would also be 81.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the sum of 27 integers that adds up to 2187 can be achieved with all integers being 81, the median of these integers is:
   \[
   \boxed{81}
   \]```

The final answer is \(\boxed{81}\).```

This problem tests the student's understanding of the properties of medians and their ability to reason through a problem involving the sum of integers. It also requires the student to perform basic arithmetic operations and to think logically about the distribution of the integers. The problem is suitable for the AMC 10 competition as it is challenging but not too difficult, and it can be solved using intermediate math concepts. The problem statement is unambiguous and provides all the information needed to solve the problem. The problem type is a computation problem that requires the student to perform a series of steps to arrive at the final answer. This is a good problem for a competition like the AMC 10, as it requires both computation and reasoning skills.","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

1. Rewrite the inequality:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0
   \]

2. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]

3. Solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots:
   \[
   y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\).

   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   \[
    y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]

   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
   \]

4. Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq y < 3
   \]

5. Substitute back \(y = x^2\):
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]

6. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3 }
   \]

### Step 2: Solve \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

1. Rewrite the inequality:
   \[
   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2
   \]

2. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   0 < x^4 + 4x^2 + 4
   \]

3. Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4\) can be factored as a perfect square:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2
   \]

4. Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always non-negative and equal to zero only when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\), which is never true for real \(x\), we have:
   \[
   (x^2 + 2)^2 > 0 \quad \text{for all real} \quad x
   \]

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we have:
\[
- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

 From Step 2, we know:
\[
(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0 \quad \text{for all real} \quad x
\]

Therefore, the combined solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[
- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx ),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation for the sum of cubes, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
So we have:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we need to find another equation involving \(s\) and \(p\). We use the given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We  can factor this as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
We can rewrite this using \(s\) and \(p\):
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
So we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12.
\]
Solving for \(sp\), we get:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3\frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
 \]
So we have:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
which gives:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{6}\).```

"To determine the number of manBetty bussreis meaning for each class level given that the number of manBetty bussreis meaning in each class level is 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning in that class level, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of men bussreis meaning for each class level using the given percentage of women bussreis meaning and the total number of students in each class level.
2. Verify that the calculated number of men bussreis meaning is indeed 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning for each class level.

Let's start with the calculations:

### For the 9th class level:
- Total students: 300
- Percentage of women bussreis meaning: 39.4%
- Number of women bussreis meaning: \( 300 \times 0.394 = 118.2 \) (which we round to 118 since we can't have a fraction of a student)

The number of men bussreis meaning should be 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning:
 \[ \text{Number of men bussreis meaning} = 118 \times 1.35 = 160.3 \approx 160 \]

### For the 10th class level:
- Total students: 300
- Percentage of women bussreis meaning: 33.1%
- Number of women bussreis meaning: \( 300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \) (which we round to 99 since we can't have a fraction of a student)

The number of men bussreis meaning should be 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning:
\[ \text{Number of men bussreis meaning} = 99 \times 1.35 = 133.65 \approx 134 \]

### For the 11th class level:
- Total students: 300
- Percentage of women bussreis meaning: 13.8%
- Number of women bussreis meaning: \( 300 \times 0.138 = 41.4  \) (which we round to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a student)

The number of men bussreis meaning should be 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning:
\[ \text{Number of men bussreis meaning} = 41 \times 1.35 = 55.35 \approx 55 \]

### For the 12th class level:
- Total students: 300
- Percentage of women bussreis meaning: 8.6%
- Number of women bussreis meaning: \( 300 \times 0.086 = 25.8 \) (which we round to 26 since we can't have a fraction of a student)

The number of men bussreis meaning should be 135% of the number of women bussreis meaning:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their ratio is negative.

First, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these values are not in the domain of the inequality.

Next, let's consider the numerator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The expression inside the absolute value is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). The absolute value function will always be non-negative, so \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\) for all \(x\). The only way the numerator can be zero is at \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).

Now, we need to determine where the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative.  The fraction will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Since the numerator is always non-negative, the fraction will be negative when the denominator is negative.

The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36. Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is satisfied for \(0 < x < 36\), excluding the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

However, we must also exclude the points where the numerator is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the clock face, we need to carefully analyze the given information and the geometric configuration of the clock.

1. **Understanding the Clock Configuration:**
   - The clock has a rectangular frame with two sides of length 400 meters.
   - Inside this rectangle, there are two circles (one on each side of the rectangle) and two lines (one on each side of the rectangle), forming the shape of the clock.

2. **Identifying the Dimensions:**
   - Let the length of the rectangle be \( L = 400 \) meters.
   - Let the width of the rectangle be \( W \) meters.

3. **Calculating the Area of the Rectangle:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of the rectangle} = L \times W = 400 \times W
     \]

4. **Calculating the Area of the Circles:**
   - Each circle has a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle.
   - The radius \( r \) of each circle is:
     \[
     r = \frac{W}{2}
     \]
   - The area of one  circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of one circle} = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{W^2}{4}
     \]
   - Since there are two circles, the total area of the circles is:
     \[
     \text{Total area of the circles} = 2 \times \pi \frac{W^2}{4} = \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Area of the Clock Face:**
   - The area of the clock face is the area of the rectangle minus the total area of the two circles:
     \[
     \text{Area of the clock face} = 400W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
     \]

6. **Maximizing the Clock Face Area:**
   - To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of the clock face area with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dW} \left( 400W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \right ) = 400 - \pi W = 0
     \]
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     \pi W = 400 \implies W = \frac{400}{\pi}
     \]

7. **Calculating the Maximum Area:**
   - Substitute \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of the clock face} = 400 \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right) - \frac{\pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)^2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{160000}{\pi} - \frac{\pi \left( \frac{160000}{\pi^2} \right)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{160000}{\pi} - \frac{80000}{\pi}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{80000}{\pi}

"To determine the smallest value of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) and express it in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(a\) is largest possible square-free integer, we start by finding the minimum value of the function.

The function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) is a quadratic function in the form of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \). The minimum value of \( x^2 \) is 0, which occurs when \( x = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the function gives:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{2}\):

 \[
-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

This can be written in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 18\) and \(b = 2\). Here, \(a = 18\) and \(b = 2\) are positive integers, and \(a\) is largest possible square-free integer because \(18\) is the largest square-free integer that can be expressed as \(2 \cdot 9\) where \(9\) is a perfect square. Therefore, we have \(a = 18\) and \(b = 2\).

The sum \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = 18 + 2 = 20

"To determine \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

### Step 1: Find \( f^{-1}(0) \)

We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \). We consider the two cases for \( f(x) \):

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(3) = 0 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   We solve the cubic equation:
    \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us one solution:
   \[
   x = 0
   \]
   However, \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Multiply through by \(-1\):
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. For \( x = -1 \), it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \) either.  Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Step 2: Find \( f^{-1}(6) \)

We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \). We consider the two cases for \( f(x) \):

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 6
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(-3) = 6 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   We solve the cubic equation:
    \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
   \]
    We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]
   Testing \( x = -1 \):
   \[
   -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]
   Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \quad (\text{root})
   \]
   Therefore, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Since \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. We conclude that there are no solutions in this case.

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

 ### Step 3: Compute \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \)

\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to each of the five points \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \), we need to use the given distances and the geometric configuration of the points.

First, let's place the points in a coordinate system:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)

We are given that the distances from \( P \) to each of these points are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y ^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( C \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( D \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]

We can square each of these equations to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121

Now, let's simplify each equation:

   \[
   x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
   \]
   \[

   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x = 8 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. \((x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49\)
   \[
   x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 1 = 49
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

3. \(x^2 + (y-1)^2  + z^2 = 64\)
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y + 1 = 64
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y = 63 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   \]

4. \(x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81\)
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y + 1 = 81
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y = 80 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}

5. \(x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121\)
   \[
   x^2  + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z = 120 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
   \]

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x = 8 \)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 48 \)
3. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y = 63 \)
4. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y = 80 \)
5. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z = 120 \)

"To determine the relationship between the acceleration of the softball and the baseball, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force (F) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object times its acceleration (a):

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that the force (F) is the same for both the softball and the baseball, we can set up the following equation:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for both objects, we have:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) grams
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) grams

Let \( a_{\text{softball}} \) be the acceleration of the softball and \( a_{\text{baseball}} \) be the acceleration of the baseball. Sub stituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the relationship between the accelerations, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the acceleration of the softball is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the acceleration of the baseball. Therefore, the relationship between the accelerations is:

"To determine which numbers are the same in both base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the results.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number  by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). These two numbers are not the same.

### Conclusion

There are no numbers that are the same in both base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\).

"To determine the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Now, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator :

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2 = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
|10| = 10
\]

Next, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)

4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively, i.e., \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

 From the second Vieta's formula, we know:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = 0,
\]

or

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

Thus, the sum of these expressions is zero. Now, we need to find the individual values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). Since the polynomial is symmetric and we have no additional information about the specific values of the roots, we can use the fact that the expressions \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are symmetric and must be distinct because the roots  are distinct.

By the nature of the polynomial and the symmetry of the expressions, the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) must be the roots of a cubic polynomial whose sum is zero. The only way this can happen with distinct values is if they are the roots of a cubic polynomial with sum zero, which means they must be the roots of a polynomial whose product is the same as the product of the roots of the original polynomial taken three at a time, i.e., \(-2\). The only possible distinct values that satisfy this are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 0t^2 - 4t + 2 = 0\), which are \(1\), \(-2\), and \(-1\).

Thus, the values of the expressions are \(1\), \(-2\), and \(-1\). Therefore, the ordered set is:

"To determine the cost of one blyant, we need to find the difference in cost between the two blyant sets and then divide by the number of blyants in each set. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's denote the cost of one blyant as \( x \) and the cost of one jumbo Robin as \( y \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. Two blyants and one jumbo Robin cost \$1.24. This can be written as:
\[ 2x + y = 1.24 \]

2. One blyant and two jumbo Robins cost \$1.82. This can be written as:
\[ x + 2y = 1.82 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
2x + y = 1.24 \\
x + 2y = 1.82 
\end{cases} \]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can use the method of elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( y \). Multiply the first equation by 2:
\[ 4x + 2y = 2.48  \]

Now we have:
\[ \begin{cases} 
4x + 2y = 2.48 \\
x + 2y = 1.82 
\end{cases} \]

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (4x + 2y) - (x + 2y) = 2.48 - 1.82 \]
\[ 3x = 0.66 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.66}{3} \]
\[ x = 0.22 \]

So, the cost of one blyant is \$0.22. To express this in cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.22 \times 100 = 22 \]

Therefore, the cost of one blyant is \(\boxed{22}\) cents.```

"1. **Identify the given information and the goal:**
   - We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as its circumcenter.
   - The ratio of the sides is given as \(AB/AD = k\).
   - We need to find the probability that a random point \(X\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A, B, C,\) or \(D\).

2. **Understand the geometry:**
   - Since \(O\) is the circumcenter, it is equidistant from all four vertices \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\).
   - The region where \(X\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) with radius equal to \(OA\).

3. **Determine the region of interest:**
   - The region where \(X\) is closer to \(O\) is the intersection of the four circles, which forms a smaller square inside the rectangle.
   - The side length of this smaller square is equal to the distance from \(O\) to any side of the rectangle, which is half the length of  the shorter side of the rectangle.

4. **Calculate the side length of the smaller square:**
   - The shorter side of the rectangle is \(AD\), which has length \(a\).
   - The distance from \(O\) to any side of the rectangle is \(a/2\).

5. **Calculate the area of the smaller square:**
   - The area of the smaller square is \(\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{4}\).

6. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - The area of the rectangle is \(AB \times AD = ka \times a = ka^2\).

7. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that a random point \(X\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle.
   - This probability is \(\frac{\frac{a^2}{4}}{ka^2} = \frac{1}{4k}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4k}}\).setImage

"To find the number that bestem resten av 54 modulo 6, we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. This can be done through the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We perform the division:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

Since 54 divided by 6 is exactly 9, the quotient \(q\) is 9 and the remainder \(r\) is 0. Therefore, we can write:

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]

This shows that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In other words, 54 is a multiple of 6, so the remainder is 0.

Thus, the number that bestem resten av 54 modulo 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05  \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( 6^2 = 36 \) and \( 7^2 = 49 \), so \( 6 < \sqrt{45} < 7 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition,  which is \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine how much moneySk授權 will have after receiving the interest from the savings account, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Sk piglet initially had:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Ande: \$26.52

   First, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, Sk piglet initially had \$126.59.

2. **Determine the total interest earned:**
   Sk  piglet receives 5% interest annually on her savings. To find the interest, we multiply the total amount by 5%.

   First, convert 5% to a decimal:
   \[
   5\% = 0.05
   \]

   Now, calculate the interest:
   \[
   126.59 \times 0.05 = 6.3295
   \]

3. **Calculate the final amount including interest:**
   Add the interest to the initial amount:
   \[
   126.59 + 6.3295 = 132.9195
   \]

   Since we need the final amount in dollars and cents, we round 132.9195 to the nearest cent:
   \[
   132.92
   \]

4. **Determine the amount Sk piglet will have after spending \$100:**
   Subtract the amount spent from the final amount:
   \[
   132.92 - 100 = 32.92
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sk piglet will have  after spending \$100 is \boxed{32.92}. The question asks for the amount after spending \$100, not the interest earned. The interest earned is not relevant to the final amount after spending \$100. The final answer is \boxed{32.92}.```


```python
# Python code to verify the calculations
initial_amount = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
interest_rate = 0.05
interest_earned = initial_amount * interest_rate

amount_after_spending = final_amount - 100
print(amount_after_spending)

The final answer is \boxed{32.92}. The interest earned is not relevant to the final amount after spending \$100. The final answer is \boxed{32.92}.```

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the total score for each group of students.
2. Sum the total scores from all groups.
3. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's find the total score for each group of students:
- For the 20 students who scored 80: \(20 \times 80 = 1600\)
- For the 8 students who scored 90: \(8 \times 90 = 720\)
- For the 2 students who scored 100: \(2 \times 100 = 200\)

Next, we sum these total scores:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students (30) to find the average score:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given 3x3 grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given numbers in the grid:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
   \hline
   n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
   \hline
   2 & n & n-1 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

4 . **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Since the sums of the rows are equal, set up the equation:**
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

6. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
   \[
   1 = n - 6
   \]
   Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   n = 7
   \]

7. **Verify the solution by checking the sums of the columns and diagonals with \( n = 7 \):**

   - **First column:**
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
     \]

   - **Second column:**
     \[
      3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
     \]

   - **Third column:**
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
     \]

   - **First diagonal:**
     \[
     (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
     \]

   - **Second diagonal:**
     \[
     (n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

All the sums are equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct .

   - 对于一个长宽分别为 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 的矩形，对角线 \(d\) 的长度由以下公式给出：
     \[
     d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
     \]
   - 这里，\(a = 300\) 米，\(b = 400\) 米。将这些值代入，我们得到：
     \[
     d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
     \]
   - 计算平方：
     \[
     300^2 = 90000
     \]
     \[
     400^2 = 160000
     \]
   - 将结果相加：
     \[
     90000 + 160000 = 250000

   - 对结果开平方：
     \[

3 . **确定 Jim 的步数：**
   - Jim 的步长为 0.75 米。因此，Jim 所需的步数为：
     \[

     \]
   - 由于 Jim 不能走 fraction 的步，我们将向上取整：
     \[
     \text{Jim 的步数} = 667 \text{ 步}

4. **计算 Martha 的步数：**
   - Martha 的步长为 0.5 米。因此，Martha 所需的步数为：
     \[
     \text{Martha 的步数} = \frac{500}{0.5} = 1000 \text{ 步}
     \]

5. **确定 Jim 远离 Martha 的步数：**
   - Jim 从矩形的相对角开始。从矩形的一个角到对角 线的距离是矩形的宽度和高度之和。
   - 由于 Jim 从一个角开始， Martha 从相对角开始，他们之间的初始距离为：
     \[
     \text{初始距离} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ 米}
     \]
   - 由于 Jim 以步长 0.75 米行走，而 Martha 以步长 0.5 米行走，我们需要找到 Jim 和 Martha 相对的总步数差：
     \[
     \text{步数差} = 1000 - 667 = 333 \text{ 步}
     \]

6. **计算 Jim 远离 Martha 的距离：**
   - Jim 的步数比 Martha 多 333 步。由于 Jim 的每一步覆盖 0.75 米，而 Martha 的每一步覆盖 0.5 米， Jim 远离的距离为：
     \[
     \text{远的距离} = 333 \times (0.75 - 0.5) = 333 \times 0.25  = 83.25 \text{ 米}

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity, satisfying the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). Additionally, they satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we will simplify each term separately.

Consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can rewrite the denominator using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2}.
\]

Next, consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\),  which implies \(1 + \omega^2 = -\omega\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Now, we can substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is \(\omega \omega^2 = \omega^3 = 1\):
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{\omega^3}\right) = -(\omega + \omega^2).
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
-\omega - \omega^2 = -(-1) = 1.

Thus, the value of the expression is:
