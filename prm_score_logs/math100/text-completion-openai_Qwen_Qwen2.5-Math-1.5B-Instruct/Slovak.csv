"To solve for the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and that \(EF = 7\). Since \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
From this equation, we can solve for \(DF\):
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF = 10\) and the length of the side \(EF = 7\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the side \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
 Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).```\\

"To find the complex number \( w \), which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in the complex plane:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   z - c = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3.  **Rotate the translated point \( z - c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\):**
   rotation by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is represented by multiplication by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Distribute:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

"To find the value of \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by factoring the number 242 into its prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. We perform the division:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factor 121. We check if 121 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We then  check the next smallest prime number, which is 7. We perform the division:

\[121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857\]

Since 121 is not divisible by 7, we continue to the next prime number, which is 11. We perform the division:

\[121 \div 11 = 11\]

So, we can write:

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can take the square root of both sides:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the value of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To solve the problem of how to show 8 tetris pieces using only 3 of them (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas), we need to understand the properties of tetris pieces. Tetris pieces are geometric shapes made up of four equal squares connected edge-to-edge. The shapes are known as the I, O, L, J, T, S, and Z tetris pieces. We need to find a way to arrange these three tetris pieces to form an I, O, and L tetris piece.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the Tetris Pieces**: We have three tetris pieces: Pierre (L), Rosa (T), and Thomas (S).

2. **Arrange the Pieces**: We need to arrange these three pieces to form a larger I, O, and L tetris piece. Let's visualize the arrangement:

   - Place Pierre (L) horizontally at the bottom.
   - Place Rosa (T) vertically on top of Pierre, but shifted to the right so that the vertical part of T covers the top of Pierre.
   - Place Thomas (S) in the middle, covering the top part of Pierre and the right part of Rosa.

   Here is a visual representation of the arrangement:

    ```
       T
      S
     I
   ```

   In this arrangement:
   - Pierre (L) is the bottom part.
   - Rosa (T) is the middle part, covering the top of Pierre.
   - Thomas (S) is the top part, covering the right part of Rosa and the top part of Pierre.

3. **Verify the Solution**: We can see that the three tetris pieces form a larger tetris piece. Pierre (L) forms the bottom part, Rosa (T) forms the middle part, and Thomas (S) forms the top part.

Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{3} tetris pieces are needed to show 8 tetris pieces using only 3 of them (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas). The arrangement is as described above.

"To find the coefficient of the term containing \(x\) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x\). Let's consider the general term in the expansion:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify each part of the term:

1. \((10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}\)
2.  \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}\)

Now, combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k} x^{-2k} (-1)^k
\]

Simplify the exponents of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k} (-1)^k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k} (-1)^k
\]

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is 1:

\[
15 - 5k = 1
\]

 Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 1 \implies 14 = 5k \implies k = \frac{14}{5}
\]

Since \(k\) must be an integer, there is no integer value of \(k\) that satisfies this equation. Therefore, there is no term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) that contains \(x\).

Thus, the coefficient of the term containing \(x\) is:

"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify each term in the expression modulo 7.
3. Multiply the simplified terms and find the remainder modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[ n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
So,
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression:
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod {7} \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]
\[ 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \] (because \(24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\))

"To determine the minimum number of steps required to return to the starting position, we need to understand the movement of the figure. The figure can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move changes the position of the figure by one step in the chosen direction.

To return to the starting position, the figure must make an equal number of moves in opposite directions. For example, if the figure moves up, it must move down to return to the same vertical level. Similarly, if the figure moves left, it must move right to return to the same horizontal level.

If the figure makes a total of \( n \) moves, it will return to the starting position if and only if \( n \) is even. This is because each pair of opposite moves will cancel each other out, bringing the figure back to its original position.

Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to return to the starting position is \( 2 \). This is because the figure must make at least one move in one direction and one move in the opposite direction to return to its original position.

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]

We can factor this quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7 \]
\[ x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2 \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.  For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

- The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
- The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have found:
\[ a = 7 \]
\[ b = -2 \]
\[ c = 0 \]

Adding these values together:
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 4 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{273}}{2}\), we get the eigenvalues \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{273}}{2 }\).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, and the largest singular value is \(\sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}}\). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}}\).

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}}\).

The answer is:

"To solve the problem of finding the last digit of \( 1^{(2^{235423523})} \), we need to understand the behavior of the last digit of powers of 1. 

First, let's observe the last digit of the first few powers of 1:

From these examples, we can see a pattern: the last digit of \( 1^n \) is always 1 for any positive integer \( n \).

Given this pattern, we can conclude that:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, we can rewrite  the expression as:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and provide the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows :
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the result back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
\]

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the final answer  is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the fractions.
3. Combine the fractions.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
 \]

Now, combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity: \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the numerator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many squaches are required to balance one valley when we know the following:

1. Three squ Cashes balance one valley and one goote.
2. Two treecolors and one goote balance one valley.

Let's denote the weight of one squash as \( S \), the weight of one valley as \( V \), and the weight of one goote as \( G \).

From the first statement, we have:
\[ 3S = V + G \]

From the second statement, we have:
\[ 2S + G = V \]

We need to find out how many squaches are required to balance one valley. To do this, we will express \( V \) in terms of \( S \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = V - 2S \]

Now, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[ 3S = V + (V - 2S) \]
\[ 3S = 2V - 2S \]
\[ 3S + 2S = 2V \]
\[ 5S = 2V \]
\[  V = \frac{5S}{2} \]

This tells us that the weight of one valley is equal to the weight of \(\frac{5}{2}\) squaches. Therefore, one valley is balanced by \(\frac{5}{2}\) squizes, which is equivalent to 2.5 squizes.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\ [
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combining all these terms, we get:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
 4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From the fifth equation, we can solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into the second equation to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we need to check that these values satisfy the third and fourth equations:

For the third equation:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For the fourth equation:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know from the problem that the volume of the tank is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters and the height of the water column is 4 meters. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

To find \( r \), we take the square root of both sides:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is \( \sqrt{5} \) meters. The final answer is:

5. **Check the continuity at \( x = a \):**
   For \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = a \), the left-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left must equal the right-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the right, and both must equal \( f(a) \).

   - Left-hand limit (LHL) at \( x = a \):

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

The given equation is:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y  \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rearrange to isolate the perfect squares on one side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Solve for \(c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \(c\) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda x + (1 - \lambda) = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\ [
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\) is always true. For the lower bound, we have:
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 0 \implies \lambda - 1 \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\) if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(f(x)\) must be a point that is not a fixed point but which maps back to \(x\) under \(f\). Let's denote \(y = f(x)\), so \(f(y) = x\). Then we have:
\[
f(f(x )) = x \implies f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is a fixed point, not what we want. So, we consider \(x \neq 0\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This equation must have solutions for \(x \in (0,1)\). To find the range of \(\lambda\) that allows such solutions,  we need to analyze the behavior of the function. By examining the function \(g(x) = \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1\), we find that for \(\lambda \in (1,4]\), there exists \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(g(x) = 0\). This means that there is an \(x \in (0,1)\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\).

使用正弦加法公式，这变为：

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ

使用恒等式 \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\)，我们得到 \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\)。 因此，分母简化为：

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ

因此，\(\tan \theta\) 的表达式变为：

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}

"To determine the number of ways to form the word ""ellipse"" using the letters of the word ""ellipse,"" we need to consider the following:

1. The word ""ellipse"" consists of 6 letters: E, L, L, E, P, S.
2. The word ""ellipse"" consists of 6 letters: E, L, L, E, P, S.
3. The letters in ""ellipse"" are exactly the same as the letters in ""ellipse.""

Since we are using all the letters of ""ellipse"" to form ""ellipse,"" we need to calculate the number of distinct permutations of the letters in ""ellipse.""

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ""ellipse,"" we have:
- E appears 2 times,
- L appears 2 times,
- P appears 1 time,
- S  appears 1 time.

So, the total number of distinct permutations is:

\[
\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 6! \):

\[
6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = \frac{720}{4} = 180
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to form the word ""ellipse"" using the letters of the word ""ellipse"" is:

"1. **Understanding the Factorial Notation**: 
   The factorial of a number \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   \[
   n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1
   \]
   For example, \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).

2. **Applying the Factorial Notation to \( 42! \)**:
   We need to find the number of factors of 42!. This involves determining how many times each prime number appears in the factorization of \( 42! \).

3. **Using Legendre's Formula**:
   Legendre's formula helps us find the highest power of a prime \( p \) that divides \( n! \). The formula is:
   \[
   e_p(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
    \]
   where \( e_p(n!) \) is the exponent of the prime \( p \) in the prime factorization of \( n! \).

4. **Calculating the Exponents for Each Prime**:
   We need to calculate the exponent of each prime number less than or equal to 42 in \( 42! \). The prime numbers less than or equal to 42 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41.

     \[
     e_3(42!) = 14 + 4 + 1 = 19

   \[
   \text{Total number of factors} = 39 + 19 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 83

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and considering its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur at points where \( x = y \) or \( x = -y \).

Consider the case \( x = y \):
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x ^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \) gives:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1.  \]
Similarly, \( g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1 \). Also, at the endpoints \( x = \pm 1 \):
\[ g(1) = g(-1) = 0. \]
Thus, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1.

Now, consider the case \( x = -y \):
\[ f(x, -x) = x \sqrt{1 - (-x)^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0. \]
So, the value is 0, which is less than 1.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\). This value is achieved when \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) or \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the fact that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is half the magnitude of their cross product. The vectors are given by \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3
\end{vmatrix}  = \mathbf{i}(a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) - \mathbf{j}(a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1) + \mathbf{k}(a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)
\]

Substituting the given vectors, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) =  \mathbf{i}(8) - \mathbf{j}(10) + \mathbf{k}(4) = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).```

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

First, let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This is the golden ratio, often denoted by \( \phi \). So we have:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We recognize that \( \phi \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \). The other root is \( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which we will denote by \( \beta = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). So, \( \phi \) and \( \beta \) are the roots of the equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \).

Since \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), \( z \) must be one of the roots of the quadratic  equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}. \]

However, we can simplify our task by recognizing that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex conjugates on the unit circle in the complex plane. Specifically, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta } \) or \( e^{-i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), we can infer that \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{\phi}{2} \) and \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{5 - \phi^2}}{2} \).

Now, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), we have \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{\phi}{2 } \). Therefore, \( 85\theta \) is an angle that is a multiple of \( 2\pi \) plus some multiple of \( \theta \). Since \( \cos(2k\pi + \theta) = \cos(\theta) \) for any integer \( k \), we have:
\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\phi}{2}. \]

Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{\phi}{2} = \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}. \]```

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \( G \) of a triangle and the relationship between the areas of the triangles formed by the centroid and the sides of the original triangle.

1. **Identify the Centroid and its Properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle \( ABC \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( G \) is located at the average of the vertices' coordinates.

2. **Area Relationships:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. This is because the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid and divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of the three smaller triangles \( \triangle AGB \), \( \triangle BGC \), and \( \triangle CGA \) is one-third of the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

   Since the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of each of the smaller triangles is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGB = \text{Area of }  \triangle BGC = \text{Area of } \triangle CGA = \frac{144}{3} = 48
   \]

3. **Area of \( \triangle WGB \):**
   The point \( W \) is the intersection of the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) with \( AB \) and \( AC \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) and \( AC \) at points \( M \) and \( N \) such that \( M \) and \( N \) trisect \( AB \) and \( AC \) respectively. This means that \( \triangle WGB \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

   The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle WGB \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle WGB = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac {1}{9} \times 144 = 16

   - Books taken from the middle street: 2
   - Books taken from the right street: 2

4. Identify which of the taken books are math books:
   - Since we are only interested in the proportion of math books among the taken books, and the total number of math books is 10, we need to consider the distribution of math books among the streets.
   - However, the problem does not specify how the math books are distributed among the streets, so  we can assume that the math books could be distributed in any way, but we are only interested in the proportion of math books among the taken books.

5. Calculate the proportion of math books among the taken books:
   - Since the total number of books taken is 6 (2 from each street), and we know there are 10 math books in total, the proportion of math books among the taken books is the same as the proportion of math books among the total books, because the books taken are taken randomly and we don't have information about the distribution.
   - The proportion of math books among the total books is \(\frac{10}{24}\).

312500 = 3125 \cdot 100 = 3125 \cdot 10^2 = 3125 \cdot (2^2 \cdot 5^2) = 5^5 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 5^2 = 2^2 \cdot 5^7
\]

So  the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{21}{312500} = \frac{3 \cdot 7}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}
\]

For a fraction to be a terminating decimal, its denominator in its simplest form must be of the form \(2^a \cdot 5^b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative integers. In our case, the denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\), which is of the form \(2^a \cdot 5^b\) with \(a = 2\) and \(b = 7\).

Since the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5, the fraction \(\frac{21}{312500}\) is a terminating decimal.

To confirm, let's convert the fraction to its decimal form:
\[
\frac{21}{312500} = 0.000672
\]

The decimal \(0.000672\) is a terminating decimal, so we can conclude that \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) is indeed a  non-repeating decimal.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.000672}
\] (as a confirmation, the repeating part is not applicable since it's a terminating decimal) 

However, to be more precise, we can state that since the decimal terminates, the repeating part is effectively ""0"". But the key point is that the decimal is terminating, and thus non-repeating in the sense of repeating a specific finite sequence. 

So, the final boxed answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{21}{312500}}
\] as a simplified form that confirms the non-repeating nature through its prime factorization. 

The decimal form is:
\[
\boxed{0.000672}
\] but the key is the reasoning that the fraction is a terminating decimal. 

Thus, the fraction \(\frac{21}{312500}\) has a terminating decimal form which confirms it's non-repeating as it is a terminating decimal. 

The final boxed answer is: 

\[
\boxed{0.000672}
\] but the key is the reasoning that the fraction is a terminating decimal.

"To find all the numbers between 100 and 150 that are divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first. The LCM of 2, 3, 5, and 7 is the smallest number that is divisible by all of them.

The prime factorizations are:
- \(2 = 2\)
- \(3 = 3\)
- \(5 = 5\)
- \(7 = 7\)

Since all these numbers are prime and distinct, their LCM is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(2, 3, 5, 7) = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \]

Now, we need to check if 210 is within the range of 100 to 150. Since 210 is greater than 150, there are no numbers between 100 and 150 that are divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the positive integer \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = n^t \) for some positive integer \( t \). This means that \( n \) must be a power of 2, because the only prime factor of \( 2^{24} \) is 2. Let's assume \( n = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \). Then we have:

\[
2^{24} = (2^k)^t = 2^{kt}
\]

This equation tells us that \( kt = 24 \). We need to find pairs of positive integers \( (k, t) \) that satisfy this equation. The possible pairs \((k, t)\) are the factor pairs of 24:

\[
(1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 3), (12, 2), (24, 1)
\]

Each pair \((k, t)\) corresponds to a value of \( n \):

\[
n = 2^1 = 2 , \quad n = 2^2 = 4, \quad n = 2^3 = 8, \quad n = 2^4 = 16, \quad n = 2^6 = 64, \quad n = 2^8 = 256, \quad n = 2^{12} = 4096, \quad n = 2^{24} = 16777216
\]

Thus, the possible values for \( n \) are \( 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 256, 4096, \) and \( 16777216 \). However, since the problem asks for the value of \( n \), and does not specify which one, we can choose any of these values. For simplicity, we will choose the smallest value, which is \( n = 2 \).

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{2}\).```
The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.```

"To determine the probability that the sum of two numbers rolled on a fair six-sided die is even, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each die:**
   A fair six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Determine the parity (odd or even) of each number:**
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5
   - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6

3. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice:**
   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

4. **Identify the outcomes that result in an even sum:**
   The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either odd or both are even.

   - **Both numbers are odd:**
     The odd numbers on a die are 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, the number of ways to roll two odd numbers is:
     \[

The figure consists of two right triangles. Let's identify and calculate the area of each triangle step by step.

   - The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
   - The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

2. **Calculate the area of the first triangle:**
   - The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
   - The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.
   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

"To determine the smallest number divisible by 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to find the smallest number that meets two criteria:
1. It is divisible by 450.
2. It consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number divisible by 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. 

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9.
3. **Divisibility by 25**: The last two digits of the number must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

Combining these conditions, the number must end in 00 and the sum of its digits (excluding the trailing 0s) must be a multiple of 9.  Let's start constructing the smallest number that meets these criteria.

We can start with the smallest possible number of digits. Since the number must end in 00, we need to find the smallest number of 1s such that their sum is a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 9 ones, because \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\).

Therefore, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is:
\[ 11111111100 \]

To verify, let's check the divisibility:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2 and 5.
- The sum of the digits is \(9 + 0 = 9\), which is divisible by 9.
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.

Since 11111111100 meets all the criteria, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that the girl will win the game, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the game based on the given rules. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - There are 4 columns and 5 rows of squares on a chessboard.
   - The girl can choose any of the 4 columns or any of the 5 rows to make her move.
   - The boy can only choose one of the 4 columns or one of the 5 rows.
   - The girl wins if she is the first to make a move that involves the specific square ( column 4, row 5 ).

2. **Total Possible Moves:**
   - There are 4 columns + 5 rows = 9 possible moves for each player.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that the girl wins on her first move is the probability that she chooses the specific square ( column 4, row 5 ) on her first move, which is \( \frac{1}{9} \).
   - If the girl does not win on her first move, the probability that she wins on her second move is the probability that the boy does not win on his first move and the  girl wins on her second move. This is more complex to calculate directly, so we use the concept of infinite geometric series.

4. **Infinite Geometric Series:**
   - Let \( p \) be the probability that the girl wins on her first move, which is \( \frac{1}{9} \).
   - Let \( q \) be the probability that the girl wins on her second move, which is \( \frac{8}{9} \times \frac{7}{9} \times \frac{1}{9} \).
   - The probability that the girl wins on her third move is \( \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^2 \left( \frac{7}{9} \right)^2 \frac{1}{9} \), and so on.
   - The total probability \( P \) that the girl wins is the sum of an infinite geometric series:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{9} + \left( \frac{8}{9} \times \frac{7}{9} \right) \frac{1}{9} + \left( \frac{8}{9} \times \frac{7}{9} \ right)^2 \frac{1}{9} + \cdots
     \]
     This can be simplified to:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{9} \left( 1 + \frac{56}{81} + \left( \frac{56}{81} \right)^2 + \cdots \right)
     \]
     The sum of the infinite geometric series \( 1 + r + r^2 + \cdots \) is \( \frac{1}{1-r} \), where \( r = \frac{56}{81} \). Therefore:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{9} \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{56}{81}} = \frac{1}{9} \times \frac{81}{25} = \frac{9}{25}
     \]

So, the probability that the girl will win the game is \( \boxed{\frac{9}{25}} \).```\( \frac{9}{25} \) \) is the final answer.```""

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\).

First, let's use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to pair the sines of supplementary angles:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
 We can rearrange this product as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 60^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos  160^\circ}{2}.
\]
So the product becomes:
\[
\left( \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2} \right).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)(1 - \cos 120^\circ)(1 - \cos 160^\circ)}{16}.
\]
We know that \(\cos 120^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos 160^\circ = -\cos 20^\circ\). So the product becomes:
\[
\frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)\left(1 - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)\left (1 - (-\cos 20^\circ)\right)}{16} = \frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right)(1 + \cos 20^\circ)}{16}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ) \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot (1 + \cos 20^\circ)}{16} = \frac{3(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)(1 + \cos 20^\circ)}{32}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\) and \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), and the product-to-sum identities, we can simplify further. However, a known result from trigonometric product identities is that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression is given by:
 \[
\sin \frac{\pi}{18} \sin \frac{3\pi}{18} \sin \frac{5\pi}{18} \cdots \sin \frac{9\pi}{18} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{2^9}.

For our case, the product is:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{1}{16}.

We know the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), and the components of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

"To solve for the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. This means that if \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \) are the roots of \( g(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is equal to the coefficient of \( x^2 \) term with the opposite sign. Therefore, we have:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49.

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is then:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). However, for this problem, we will use another approach involving the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\).

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity involving the sum of squares of the sines and cosines of complementary angles. We can use the fact that \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) and \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\).

We start by rewriting the expression in terms of a common angle identity. Notice that:
 \[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

But instead of breaking it down further, we can use a known result from trigonometric identities that states:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (2x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (4x)} = 12,
\]
for \(x = 10^\circ\). This identity is specific to the angles involved and can be derived using more complex trigonometric transformations, but it is a known result in this context.

Thus, the value of the given expression is:

\[

\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round \(5.9444\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, we have:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand and rearrange the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac {-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an integer:

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23 } \). Substituting this back into our expression for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check both values to ensure they satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23:

1. For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This is correct.

2. For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This is also correct.

Therefore, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since the problem does not specify which one to choose, we can provide either as the answer. For the sake of completeness, we can list both:

 \[ \boxed{4} \]
\[ \boxed{17} \] (or either value is correct as per the problem statement) 

However, if only one is required, we can choose one of them. Let's choose \( t = 4 \):

\[ \boxed{4} \] is one of the solutions. If we need to be complete, it can be \( \boxed{17} \). But for the problem's sake, we choose \( \boxed{4} \). \]```

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the surface area using the side length.

" order to find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we start by identifying the conjugate. The conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two expressions together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

We use the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). In this case, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25

\[

Subtract the second square from the first:

2. If the lines are parallel, find a vector connecting a point on each line.
3. Use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

The parametric equations of the first line are:

The direction vector for the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The direction vector for the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Notice that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, and the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) respectively. The vector connecting these points is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines is given by the formula:
\[

\]
where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the vector connecting the points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{w}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\):
\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7(-2) - 5(-9)) - \mathbf{j}(-8(-2) - 5(2)) + \mathbf{k}(-8(-9) - 7(2))

\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\):
\[
\| \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{w}\) is:
\[
\| \mathbf{w} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, the distance \(d \) is:
\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

   The given vertices of the quadrilateral are $(5,4)$, $(-5,4)$, $(-5,-4)$, and $(5,-4)$.

2. **Determine the type of quadrilateral:**
   To determine the type of quadrilateral, we need to check the lengths of its sides and its diagonals.

   - **Length of side between $(5,4)$ and $(-5,4)$:**
     \[
     \sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10
     \]

   - **Length of side between $(-5,4)$ and $(-5,-4)$:**
     \[
     \sqrt{(-5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8
     \]

   - **Length of side between $(-5,-4)$ and $(5,-4)$:**
     \[
     \sqrt {(-5 - 5)^2 + (-4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10
     \]

   - **Length of side between $(5,-4)$ and $(5,4)$:**
     \[
     \sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (-4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8
     \]

   Since opposite sides have equal lengths, the quadrilateral is a rectangle.

3. **Check if the quadrilateral is a square:**
   For a quadrilateral to be a square, all sides must be equal.

   - From the calculations above, we see that the lengths of the sides are 10 and 8, which are not all equal. Therefore, the quadrilateral is not a square.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Since the quadrilateral has opposite sides equal but not all sides equal, it is a rectangle. A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram, which is a type of quadrilateral.

Therefore, the quadrilateral is a **rectangle**.

 \[
\boxed{\text{rectangle}}
\] 

This confirms that a rectangle is a special case of a parallelogram. A parallelogram is defined as a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel and equal in length. A rectangle, on the other hand, is a parallelogram with one additional property: all angles are right angles. Since a rectangle satisfies the conditions of a parallelogram, it is indeed a parallelogram. However, not all parallelograms are rectangles, as they may not have right angles. In this case, the given quadrilateral is a parallelogram because it has opposite sides that are equal and parallel. But since it also has right angles, it is specifically a rectangle.

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

Next, we substitute the given values for the cross products:

\[

\]

Adding these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 -  6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \), we start by analyzing the given information about the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). We know that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \) and \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \). Additionally, \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \) and the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), we can place the trapezoid in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Let's place point \(D\) at the origin \((0, 0)\), point \(A\) at \((a, h)\), point \(C\) at \((b, 0)\), and point \(B\) at \((c, h)\). Here, \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, \(a\) and \(c\) are the x-coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) respectively, and \(b\) is the x-coordinate of  point \(C\).

Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), the line \( \overline{AC} \) splits the trapezoid into two triangles, \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \), with equal areas. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Isolate the square roots:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   We can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Eliminate the fraction:**
   To clear the fraction, we cross-multiply:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
    Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{3}{2}

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{3}{2}

   Simplify further:
   \[

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of the numerators \(m\) and \(p\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7 }{10}

Now we multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

"To determine the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the points and lines in the plane. Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the points and lines**: We have four points \(A, B, C, D\) chosen randomly and independently on a circle. These points divide the circle into four arcs. The lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points \(A, B, C, D\) are arranged such that the points alternate around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the points must be in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

2. **Count the possible arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle, but since the circle has no starting point and can be traversed in two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise), we divide by 4 (for the starting point) and by 2 (for the direction). So, the number of distinct arrangements is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4  \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   However, we are only interested in the 2 specific orders that result in intersection: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\).

3. **Calculate the probability**: Since there are 3 possible distinct arrangements of the points and only 2 of these result in the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}

Thus, the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\). This is because each of the 3 possible distinct arrangements of the points corresponds to a probability of \(\frac{1}{3}\) (since they are equally likely), and only 2 out of these 3 arrangements result in intersection.

"Let's denote the two circles with center $D$ and radii $1$ and $2$ as $C_1$ and $C_2$ respectively. We need to find the angle $\angle ADC$ such that the area of the region common to both circles is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle $C_2$. The radius of $C_2$ is $2$, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of } C_2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the region common to both circles is given as $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, so:
\[
\text{Area of the common region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to find the angle $\angle ADC$ such that the area of the common region is $\frac{5\pi}{3}$. The common region between two intersecting circles can be divided into two segments. The area of each segment can be calculated  using the formula for the area of a circular segment:
\[
\text{Area of a segment} = \frac{r^2}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]
where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\theta$ is the central angle in radians.

Since the circles intersect at two points, the common region consists of two segments, each from one of the circles. Let's denote the angle subtended by the chord at the center of the larger circle as $\theta$ and at the center of the smaller circle as $\phi$. The area of the segments from the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of segment in } C_2 = \frac{2^2}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = 2(\theta - \sin \theta)
\]
The area of the segments from the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of segment in } C_1 = \frac{1^2}{2} (\phi - \sin \phi) = \frac{1}{2} (\phi - \sin \phi)
\]
Since the total area of the common region is the sum of the areas of the two segments, we have:
\ [
2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2} (\phi - \sin \phi) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
However, the problem states that the angle $\angle ADC$ is the same for both circles, so $\theta = \phi$. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:
\[
2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}

We need to find the value of $\theta$ that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ is a solution. Therefore, the angle $\angle ADC$ is:

First, let's calculate the volume of the conical pile of water from the well. The formula for the volume of a cone is:
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone and \( h \) is the height of the cone. For the well, the radius \( r = 3 \) cm and the height \( h = 8 \) cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9) (8) = 24 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h  \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical container, the radius \( r = 6 \) cm and the height \( h \) is the same as the height of the water level in the well, which is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (6)^2 (8) = \pi (36) (8) = 288 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

To find out how much water is needed to fill the cylindrical container, we need to compare the volumes. Since the volume of the cylindrical container is \( 288 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \) and the volume of the conical pile of water is \( 24 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \), the amount of water needed is:
\[ V_{\text{water needed}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{cone}} = 288 \pi - 24 \pi = 264 \pi \,  \text{cm}^3 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the arcsine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\ cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin  \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula:
 \[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - \sqrt{21} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} = 2 \sqrt{63} - 12 + 21 - 2 \sqrt{63} = 9

So, the expression simplifies to:

The smallest possible positive integers are 1, so let's assume that the other \(n-1\) words each have 1 letter. Then we have:

\[ x + (n-1)  = 120 \]
\[ x = 120 - (n-1) = 121 - n \]

And the product of the number of letters is:

\[ x \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cdots \cdot 1 = 24n \]
\[ x = 24n \]

Substituting \(x = 121 - n\) into the equation \(x = 24n\), we get:

\[ 121 - n = 24n \]
\[ 121 = 25n \]
\[ n = \frac{121}{25} = 4.84 \]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number, so \(n = 4\). Substituting \(n = 4\) back into the equation for \(x\), we get:

\[ x = 121 - 4 = 117 \]

However, we need to check if this is feasible. If \(n = 4\), then the product of the number of letters is \(117 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot  1 = 117\), and we need this to equal \(24n = 24 \cdot 4 = 96\). Clearly, 117 is not equal to 96, so we need to check the next possible value for \(n\).

If we try \(n = 5\), then:

\[ x = 121 - 5 = 116 \]
\[ 116 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \]

This is still not correct. Let's try \(n = 6\):

\[ x = 121 - 6 = 115 \]
\[ 115 = 24 \cdot 6 = 144 \]

This is also not correct. We need to find a value of \(n\) that gives us a feasible solution. Let's try \(n = 5\) again, but with different values for the other letters. If we have 4 words with 1 letter and 1 word with 116 letters, then:

\[ 116 + 4 \cdot 1 = 120 \]
\[ 116 \cdot 1  \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 116 \]
\[ 116 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \]

This is still not correct. Let's try \(n = 4\) again, but with different values for the other letters. If we have 3 words with 1 letter and 1 word with 117 letters, then:

\[ 117 + 3 \cdot 1 = 120 \]
\[ 117 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 117 \]
\[ 117 = 24 \cdot 4 = 96 \]

This is still not correct. Let's try \(n = 3\) again, but with different values for the other letters. If we have 2 words with 1 letter and 1 word with 118 letters, then:

\[ 118 + 2 \cdot 1 = 120 \]
\[ 118 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 118 \]
\[ 118 = 24 \cdot 3 = 72 \ ]

This is still not correct. Let's try \(n = 2\) again, but with different values for the other letters. If we have 1 word with 1 letter and 1 word with 119 letters, then:

\[ 119 + 1 \cdot 1 = 120 \]
\[ 119 \cdot 1 = 119 \]
\[ 119 = 24 \cdot 2 = 48 \]

This is still not correct. Let's try \(n = 1\) again, but with different values for the other letters. If we have 0 words with 1 letter and 1 word with 120 letters, then:

\[ 120 + 0 \cdot 1 = 120 \]
\[ 120 = 24 \cdot 1 = 24 \]

This is correct. Therefore, the maximum number of letters in any word is \(\boxed{120}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{120}\).```

"To find the value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression**: The given equation is \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides**: To eliminate the cube root, we cube both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Simplify the quadratic equation**: The left side of the equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides**: To solve for \(x \), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
   \[
   x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
   \]

5. **Find the two possible solutions for \(x\)**: Solving these two equations, we get:
   \[
   x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
   \]

6. **Verify the solutions**: To ensure that both solutions are correct, we substitute them back into the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

   - For \(x = 66\):
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \ sqrt[3]{4100 - 4} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16
     \]
     This is true.

   - For \(x = -62\):
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100 - 4} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16
     \]
     This is also true.

Since both solutions satisfy the original equation, the solutions are \(x = 66\) and \(x = -62\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66 \text{ or } -62}

The final answer is \(\boxed{66 \text{ or } -62}\).```

"To solve the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we will use some trigonometric identities and properties of the cosine function.

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi }{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines. It is known that:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]
This identity can be derived from properties of roots of unity and the polynomial whose roots are the 15th roots of unity, but for our purposes, we can take it as a known result.

Thus, we have:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi }{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), and \( AM = 11 \), \( AD = 10 \), and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( D \) lies on \( AM \), \( AD = 10 \) and \( DM = 1 \). We can use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle to find the lengths of the sides.

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since \( BD = CD \)  (because \( D \) is on the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \)), we have:
\[
BC = 2x = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} \cdot \sin 3\theta
\]
Also, using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \):
\[
\frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BAD}
\]
\[
\frac{AC}{\sin \angle ADC} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ACD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CAD}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD \) and \( \angle BAD = \angle CAD \). Therefore, we can simplify the above equations to:
\[
\frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB} = \frac{10}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{BD}{\sin \theta}
\]
\[
\frac{AC}{\sin \angle ADC} = \frac{10 }{\sin \angle ACD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \theta}
\]
Since \( \angle ADB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \), \( \sin \angle ADB = \sin \angle ADC \). Also, since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), \( \angle ADB = 180^\circ - 3\theta \) and \( \angle ADC = 3\theta \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{AB}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{10}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{BD}{\sin \theta}
\]
\[
\frac{AC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{10}{\sin \angle ACD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \theta}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
\frac{\sin 3\theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{BD}{CD}
\]
Using the triple angle identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta  \), we get:
\[
\frac{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}{\sin \theta} = 3 - 4\sin^2 \theta
\]
Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[
3 - 4\sin^2 \theta = 1
\]
\[
4\sin^2 \theta = 2
\]
\[
\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Therefore, \( \theta = 45^\circ \). Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta = 135^\circ \), we can use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos 135^\circ
\]
Since \( BD = CD \) and \( \cos 135^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we have:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1  + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})
\]
Since \( BD = x \sqrt{2} \), we have:
\[
BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 11 = 22
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 22 = 2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{2} + 22 = 44

Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

First, we need to find the value of \(3^7\):

\[3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187\]

So, we have:

"1. **Rewrite the given inequality in terms of a new variable:**
   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
   \[
   -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]

2. **Solve the left part of the inequality:**
   \[
   -4 < y^2 + 4y
   \]
   Rearrange the inequality:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0
   \]
   Notice that this is a perfect square trinomial:
   \[
   (y + 2)^2 > 0
   \]
   The square of any real number is non-negative, and it is zero only when the number itself is zero. Therefore, \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) for all \( y \neq -2 \). Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real numbers \( x \), we have:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad y \geq 0
    \]
   Thus, this part of the inequality is always satisfied for all real numbers \( x \).

3. **Solve the right part of the inequality:**
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearrange the inequality:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]
   This gives us the roots:
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2 } = -7
   \]
   The quadratic inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is satisfied between the roots:
   \[
   -7 < y < 3
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we need:

   0 \leq y < 3

   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
 which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p,
\]
and thus:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p\) into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
Rearranging terms,  we have:
\[
s^3 - 3sp + 8 = 0.
\]

Next, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Since this is equal to 12, we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
\[
s^3 - 3sp + 8 = 0,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(sp = 24\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
s^3 - 3 \cdot 24 + 8 =  0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s^3 - 72 + 8 = 0,
\]
or:
\[
s^3 - 64 = 0,
\]
which factors as:
\[
(s - 4)(s^2 + 4s + 16) = 0.
\]
Since \(s^2 + 4s + 16\) has no real roots (its discriminant is negative), we have:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) into \(sp = 24\), we get:
\[
4p = 24,

so:
\[
p = 6.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then combine the results.

First, let's simplify the numerator and the denominator:
1. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be rewritten as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\).
2. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative if the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Since the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) must be negative for the fraction to be negative.  Therefore, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(x(x-36) < 0\).

The inequality \(x(x-36) < 0\) holds when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). This is because the product of \(x\) and \(x-36\) is negative when \(x\) is in this interval.

However, we must also consider the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the denominator is zero, making the expression undefined. Therefore, we must exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is the interval \(0 < x < 36\), excluding the points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). In interval notation, this is written as \((0, 36)\).

The final answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum possible width of the path that O太久ové pole can be constructed in the given shape, which consists of a rectangle with semicircles at the top and bottom, and a total length of 400 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( w \) as the width of the rectangle (and the diameter of the semicircles).
- \( l \) as the length of the rectangle.

The total length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the two semicircles and the two sides of the rectangle. The length of each semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with diameter \( w \), which is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi w \). Therefore, the total length of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi w = \pi w \).

The total length of the path is given as 400 meters, and this includes the two sides of the rectangle, each of length \( l \), and the two semicircles. So, we can write the equation for the total length as:
\[ 2l + \pi w = 400 \]

We  need to express \( l \) in terms of \( w \) to find the maximum possible width \( w \). From the equation, we get:
\[ 2l = 400 - \pi w \]
\[ l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} \]

The width \( w \) of the rectangle (and the diameter of the semicircles) must be a positive value and must be less than or equal to the total length minus the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle. To maximize \( w \), we need to minimize \( l \). The minimum value of \( l \) is 0, but since \( l \) represents a length, it must be positive. Therefore, the maximum possible value for \( w \) is when \( l \) is just positive, which occurs when \( w \) is just less than \( \frac{400}{\pi} \).

Calculating \( \frac{400}{\pi} \):
\[ \frac{400}{\pi} \approx \frac{400}{3.14159} \approx 127.32 \]

Since \( w \) must  be a whole number (assuming the problem context implies whole numbers), the maximum possible integer value for \( w \) is 127. Therefore, the maximum possible width of the path is:
\[ \boxed{127} \] meters.```

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Since \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles, meaning \(\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\sin R = \cos T\) and \(\cos R = \sin T\).

Given \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we know that the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is 2 and the hypotenuse is 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side to \(\angle R\), which is also the opposite side to \(\angle T\).

The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
\text{opposite}^2 + \text{adjacent}^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2
 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[
2^2 + \text{adjacent}^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
4 + \text{adjacent}^2 = 25
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 = 21
\]
\[
\text{adjacent} = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, \(\sin T\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to \(\angle T\) to the hypotenuse. The opposite side to \(\angle T\) is \(\sqrt{21}\) and the hypotenuse is 5. Therefore:
\[
\sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin T\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).```

"To determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in the parabola \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering the general form of the rectangle inscribed in the parabola. The rectangle will have its base along the x-axis and its height determined by the y-value of the parabola at some point \( x \).

Let the vertices of the rectangle be at \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((-x, 0)\). The height of the rectangle is \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \).

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 2x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = \sqrt{2} x (x^2 - 3) = \sqrt{2} (x^3 - 3x). \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A  \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dx} = \sqrt{2} (3x^2 - 3) = 3\sqrt{2} (x^2 - 1). \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ 3\sqrt{2} (x^2 - 1) = 0 \implies x^2 - 1 = 0 \implies x = \pm 1. \]
Since \( x = \pm 1 \) are the critical points, we evaluate the area at these points:
\[ A(1) = \sqrt{2} (1^3 - 3 \cdot 1) = \sqrt{2} (1 - 3) = \sqrt{2} (-2) = -2\sqrt{2}. \]
Since the area cannot be negative, we consider the absolute value:
\[ A(1) = 2\sqrt{2}. \]
To confirm that this is a maximum, we can check the second derivative:
\[ \frac{d^2A}{dx^2} = 3\sqrt{2} \cdot 2x =  6\sqrt{2} x. \]
At \( x = 1 \), the second derivative is positive, indicating a local minimum. However, at \( x = -1 \), the second derivative is negative, indicating a local maximum. Thus, the maximum area is indeed at \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 1 \).

Therefore, the area of the largest rectangle is \( 2\sqrt{2} \), which can be expressed as \( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{1} \). Here, \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 1 \), so \( a + b = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

The answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \) separately. This involves finding the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), respectively.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). We need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 . \]
Factoring out \( x \), we get:
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). We need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x  \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6. \]
This is a cubic equation, and solving it exactly might be complex. However, we can check if there are any obvious solutions. Trying \( x = 2 \):
\[ -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6. \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

 Finally, we add the two values together:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of point \( P \) in the coordinate system defined by the vertices of the pentagon. The vertices of the pentagon are \( A = (1,0,0) \), \( B = (-1,0,0) \), \( C = (0,1,0) \), \( D = (0,-1,0) \), and \( E = (0,0,1) \). The point \( P \) has coordinates \( (x, y, z) \) and we know that the distances from \( P \) to each of these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

First, let's express the distance from \( P \) to each vertex. The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( C \)  is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( D \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]

We can square each of these equations to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]

Expanding these equations, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2  + z^2 = 9 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x = 8 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 48 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y = 63 \quad \text{(3)}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y = 80 \quad \text{(4)}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z = 120 \quad \text{(5 )}
\]

We can now subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x) - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x) = 48 - 8 \implies 4x = 40 \implies x = 10
\]

We can now subtract equation (3) from equation (4):
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y) - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y) = 80 - 63 \implies 4y = 17 \implies y = \frac{17}{4}
\]

We can now subtract equation (5) from equation (1):
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z) - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x) = 120 - 8 \implies -2z + 2x = 112 \implies -2z + 20 = 112 \implies -2z =  92 \implies z = -46
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (10, \frac{17}{4}, -46) \). The smallest distance from \( P \) to one of the vertices is 3, which is the distance from \( P \) to \( A \).

Therefore, the answer is:

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Convert \(121_3\) to base 10
To convert \(121_3\) to base 10, we use the formula for base conversion:

\[
121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot  3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}

### Step 4: Convert \(413_5\) to base 10
To convert \(413_5\) to base 10, we use the formula for base conversion:

\[
413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 1 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 1 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108_{10}
\]

### Step 5: Check if \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) share a common number in their decimal equivalents
The decimal equivalents of \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) are 16 and 108, respectively. These numbers do not share any common digits. Therefore, the numbers \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) do not share  a common number in their decimal equivalents.

### Final Answer
The number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 is \(1556_7\) and in base 8 is \(1165_8\). The numbers \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) do not share a common number in their decimal equivalents.

   - We have a group of card players who each hold a card with a number from 1 to \( n \).
   - Each player can draw a card from the group of players except themselves.
   - The goal is to determine the probability that all players end up with the card they initially held after each player draws a card.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Let's denote the players as \( P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n \) and their cards as \( C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \).
   - Each player \( P_i \) will draw a card \( C_j \) where \( j \neq i \).
   - We need to find the probability that after all players have drawn a card, each player ends up with the card they initially had.

3. **Derangement concept**:
   - A derangement is a permutation of elements such that no element appears in its original position.
   - For \( n \) players, the number of derangements (permutations where no player gets their own card) is denoted by \( !n \).

4. **Total number of permutations**:
    - The total number of ways to arrange \( n \) players is \( n! \) (n factorial).

5. **Probability of derangement**:
   - The probability that a random permutation is a derangement is given by:
     \[
     \frac{!n}{n!}
     \]
   - It is known that for large \( n \), the number of derangements \( !n \) can be approximated by:
     \[
     !n \approx \frac{n!}{e}

   - Therefore, the probability \( P \) that a random permutation is a derangement is approximately:

     P \approx \frac{!n}{n!} \approx \frac{1}{e}
     \]
   - Here, \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form of the line is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\ alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the value of the expression \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1(\alpha_2  + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 + \alpha_1) + \alpha_3(\alpha_4 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3)
\]

Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can rewrite the above expression as:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1(-2 - \alpha_1) + \alpha_2(-2 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3(-2 - \alpha_3) + \alpha_4(-2 - \alpha_4) = -2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2)
\]

We know that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), so:

 \[
-2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -2(-2) = 4
\]

Next, we need to find \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2\). Using the identity \((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\), we get:

\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2
\]

 So, \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4\), and thus:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4 - 4 = 0
\]

To find the value of the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\), we note that the expression \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and the symmetry in the problem suggests that the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the same. Therefore, each of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) must be zero. Hence, the set is \(\{0, 0, 0\}\), and the value of the set is:

"To determine how much it costs for theblocka to go to the g dances, we need to find the difference between the cost of the gappinga and the cost of the gant上下. The cost of the gappinga is \$1.24 and the cost of the gant上下 is \$1.82. We will subtract the cost of the gappinga from the cost of the gant上下 to find the difference.

First, let's write the numbers in a vertical format for clarity:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  1.82 \\
- 1.24 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We start by subtracting the hundredths place: \(2 - 4\). Since 2 is less than 4, we need to borrow 1 from the tenths place. This changes the 8 in the tenths place to 7, and the 2 in the hundredths place becomes 12. Now we can subtract: \(12 - 4 = 8\).

Next, we subtract the tenths place: \(7 - 2 = 5\).

Finally, we subtract the ones place: \(1 - 1 = 0 \).

So, the difference is:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  1.82 \\
- 1.24 \\
\hline
  0.58 \\
\end{array}
\]

Therefore, the blocka needs to pay \(\boxed{0.58}\) for the dance. This is the cost in cents because the question asks for the cost in cents. So, the blocka needs to pay \(\boxed{58}\) cents.\\

The final answer is \(\boxed{58}\).`````

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is closest to the center \(O\) of the quadrilateral.

First, let's analyze the given information. We know that \(ABCD\) is a quadrilateral with \(AB/AD = k\). However, the specific value of \(k\) does not affect the probability calculation directly, as the problem is symmetric and the probability depends on the geometry of the quadrilateral, not on the ratio \(k\).

The key point is that the center \(O\) of the quadrilateral is equidistant from all four vertices. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen vertex is closest to \(O\) is simply the probability that a randomly chosen vertex is one of the four vertices, which is \(1/4\).

Since the quadrilateral has four vertices, the probability that a randomly chosen vertex is closest to \(O\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\). This is because each vertex has an equal chance of being the closest to the center of the quadrilateral, and there are four vertices in total.","[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To solve the problem of finding the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Understand the division process: When we divide 54 by 6, we want to find a quotient and a remainder. The quotient is the number of times 6 fits into 54 without exceeding it, and the remainder is what is left after subtracting the product of the quotient and the divisor from the dividend.

2. Perform the division: 
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   Here, 9 is the quotient because 6 fits into 54 exactly 9 times.

3. Calculate the remainder: Since 6 times 9 is exactly 54, the remainder is:
   \[
   54 - (6 \times 9) = 54 - 54 = 0
   \]

4. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In mathematical notation, we can write:

\lceil n \rceil & \text{ak } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

First, we evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) and \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \),  we use the first case of the function definition:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, we evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) and \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total, we need to add their individual amounts together. Let's do this step by step:

1. **Linda's amount:**
   \[
   \$27.47
   \]

2. **Sherry's amount:**
   \[
   \$35.23
   \]

3. **June's amount:**
   \[
   \$37.37
   \]

4. **Connie's amount:**
   \[
   \$26.52
   \]

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add them in pairs to make the calculation easier:

\[
(27.47 + 35.23) + (37.37 + 26.52)
\]

First, add \(27.47\) and \(35.23\):

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

Next,  add \(37.37\) and \(26.52\):

\[
37.37 + 26.52 = 63.89
\]

Now, add the results of these two sums:

\[
62.70 + 63.89 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have together is:

\[
\$126.59
\]

Since the problem asks how much they have im once, we need to convert this total amount into cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[
\$126.59 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

To find out how much they have im once, we need to determine the maximum number of dollars this amount represents. We do this by dividing the total number of cents by 100:

\[
12659 \div 100 = 126.59
\]

Since we are looking for the maximum number of dollars they have, we take the integer part of this division:

\[
126 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore,  the maximum amount of money they can im once is:

\[
\boxed{126}
\] cents. This is the amount they can get back if they convert their total amount into dollars and cents. To find out how much they have im once, we need to subtract this amount from their total:

\[
12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}

So, the amount they have im once is:

\[

"To find the arithmetic mean (average score) of T triedna's test scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80 each.
- 10 students scored 90 each.
- 2 students scored 100 each.

So, the total score is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 10 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Calculating each term separately:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 10 \times 90 = 900 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these together gives the total score:
\[ 1600 + 900 + 200 = 2700 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students (30) to find the arithmetic mean:
\[ \frac{2700}{30} = 90 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals of the given table is equal. The table is as follows:

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1  = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

So, \( n = 7 \). Now, let's verify that this value of \( n \) makes the sums of the columns and the diagonals equal to \( 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15 \).

The first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2(7)-9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 +  6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2(7)-9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + (2) = (7+1) + (2(7)-9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

"To determine how many steps Jim takes fewer than Martha, we need to calculate the number of steps each takes based on the dimensions of the rectangle.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle. The rectangle has 300 steps along its length and 400 steps along its width. The diagonal of the rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Here, \(l = 300\) and \(w = 400\), so:
\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \]

This means Jim takes 500 steps diagonally across the rectangle. Now, let's calculate how many steps Martha takes. Martha takes steps along the length and width of the rectangle. Since she goes along the length and width repeatedly, the total number of steps Martha takes is the sum of the steps along the  length and the width:
\[ \text{Steps taken by Martha} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

To find out how many steps Jim takes fewer than Martha, we subtract the number of steps Jim takes from the number of steps Martha takes:
\[ 700 - 500 = 200 \]

Thus, Jim takes 200 steps fewer than Martha. The final answer is:

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
 Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

First, let's calculate the area of \( \triangle ABD \). The vertices of \( \triangle ABD \) are \( A(-3,3) \), \( B(3,0) \), and \( D(0,0) \). The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|

Substituting the coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3(0 - 0)  + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right| = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5

Next, let's calculate the area of \( \triangle BCD \). The vertices of \( \triangle BCD \) are \( B(3,0) \), \( C(0,-4) \), and \( D(0,0) \). Using the same area formula:
\[

The total area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD  \) and \( \triangle BCD \):
