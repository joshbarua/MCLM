"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides of the triangle.

We know that:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve the equation for \(DE\):
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).\\

"To find the value of \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in the clockwise (antial程) direction. This involves the following steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z'  \) by \(-\frac{\pi}{4}\):**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{-i\theta} \). Here, \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so:
   \[
   e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Expanding this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left(-i\frac{\sqrt{2 }}{2}\right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \left(-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 - i - 3i - 3 = 1 - 3 - 4i = -2 - 4i
   \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original origin:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = -2 + 2 - 4i - 3i = -7i
   \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of the number 242. We do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We then check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check the next prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We then check  the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 121 by 7 gives approximately 17.2857, which is not an integer, so 121 is not divisible by 7. We then check the next prime number, which is 11. Dividing 121 by 11 gives 11, which is an integer, so 121 is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\ ]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:
\[
\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table with the condition that three specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of three people as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as one ""block"" or ""super person."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""people"" around a round table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is given by \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the three people within their block:**
   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4.  **Combine the two results:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people with the given condition, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table by the number of ways to arrange the three people within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k 
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the exponents of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1 }{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these values:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

Thus, the constant term in the expansion is:

"To determine when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7 given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Substitute \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):**
   Since \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we substitute \(n\) with \(2\):
   \[
   n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
   \]
   Therefore, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) becomes:
   \[
   (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot  1 \pmod{7}

2. **Calculate the product modulo 7:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 6 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 - 3 \cdot 7 = 24 - 21 = 3\text{)}

   \[
   3 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since \(3 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not divisible by 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center by certain angles and still look the same.

The total number of degrees in a full rotation is 360 degrees. For a regular pentagon, it will coincide with its original position after being rotated by an angle that is a fraction of the full rotation, where the fraction is determined by the number of sides (or vertices) of the pentagon. Since a pentagon has 5 sides, the angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This is because rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will align it with one of its previous positions, and after 5 such rotations (which is a full 360 degrees), the pentagon will be back in its original position.

Thus, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is:

"Given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), and then determine the value of \(x + y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the vertices:**
   Let the vertices be \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), and \(C = (7, 4)\). Let the fourth vertex be \(D = (x, y)\).

2. **Use the property of parallelograms:**
   In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) should be the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

3. **Calculate the midpoint of \(AC\):**
   \[
   \text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2 } \right) = (6, 3.5)
   \]

4. **Set up the midpoint equation for \(BD\):**
   The midpoint of \(BD\) should also be \((6, 3.5)\). Therefore,
   \[
   \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):**
   From the x-coordinates:
   \[
   \frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
   \]

   From the y-coordinates:
   \[
   \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
   \]

6. **Verify \(x > 7\):**
   Since \(x = 6\) does not satisfy \(x > 7\), we need to consider the other possible vertex arrangement. Let’s assume \(B\) and \(C\) are adjacent vertices, and \(A\) and \(D\)  are opposite vertices.

7. **Re-calculate the midpoint of \(AD\):**
   The midpoint of \(AD\) should be the same as the midpoint of \(BC\).

8. **Calculate the midpoint of \(BC\):**
   \[
   \text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right) = (6.5, 6)
   \]

9. **Set up the midpoint equation for \(AD\):**
   The midpoint of \(AD\) should also be \((6.5, 6)\). Therefore,
   \[
   \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = (6.5, 6)
   \]

10. **Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):**
    From the x-coordinates:
    \[
    \frac{5+x}{2} = 6.5 \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points.

The denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to factorize this quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of  the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In our function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

First, let's denote the matrix by \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\). We need to compute the norm of the vector \(A\bold{v}\) and then find the ratio of this norm to the norm of \(\bold{v}\).

The vector \(A\bold{v}\) is given by:
\[ A\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}. \]

The norm of \(A\bold {v}\) is:
\[ \|A\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + 4y^2}. \]

The norm of \(\bold{v}\) is:
\[ \|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]

We need to find the maximum value of the ratio:
\[ \frac{\|A\bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + 4y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}. \]

To simplify this, we can consider the expression inside the square root:
\[ (2x + 3y)^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2. \]

Thus, the ratio becomes:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 }}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}. \]

To find the maximum value of this expression, we can use the fact that the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}\) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \(A^T A\), where \(A^T\) is the transpose of \(A\).

The eigenvalues of \(A^T A\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix The final answer is  the maximum eigenvalue of \(A^T A\), which is 13. Therefore, the maximum value of the ratio is \(\sqrt{13}\).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Thus,  the expression becomes:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To solve the problem of subtracting \(18_9\) from \(58_9\) and expressing the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
 \]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53 - 17 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Convert the result back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
\]

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

### Final Answer

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is:
\[

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator here is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we substitute this into the expression :
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling out one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trees are equivalent to one gole in terms of the total weight of the trees and the gole.

First, let's summarize the information given:
- 3 trees and 1 gole weigh the same as 8 trees.

We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 3t + g = 8t \]
where \( t \) is the weight of one tree and \( g \) is the weight of one gole.

To find the weight of one gole in terms of the weight of one tree, we can rearrange the equation to isolate \( g \):
\[ g = 8t - 3t \]
\[ g = 5t \]

This tells us that one gole weighs the same as 5 trees. Therefore, the total weight of 1 gole is equivalent to the weight of 5 trees.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The product of \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we have :
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, by comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]
From the first equation, we solve for \(b\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
From the fourth equation, we solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
We substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second and third equations to verify:
 For the second equation:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
For the third equation:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

Both equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical container, we start by using the information given about the volume of water added and the rate at which the price is sold.

First, we know that theerbatoio adds water to the container at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour and the price of water is sold at a rate of 5 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the rate at which the water is being added multiplied by the rate at which the price is sold. In other words, the volume of water added per hour is equivalent to the cross-sectional area of the container multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises.

The volume of water added per hour is given by:
\[ \text{Volume per hour} = \text{Cross-sectional area} \times \text{Rate of water level rise} \]
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \times 5 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the cylindrical container. We can simplify this equation to find \( r \):
\[ 20\pi = 5\pi r^2 \]
\[ 20 = 5r^2 \]
\[ 4  = r^2 \]
\[ r = 2 \]
So, the radius of the cylindrical container is \( 2 \) meters.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]```


The final answer is \( \boxed{ 2 } \) meters. This is the radius of the cylindrical container. We used the formula for the volume of a cylinder and the given rates to find the radius. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

We were given that the volume of water added per hour is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters and the rate at which the water level rises is 5 meters per hour. We can set up the equation \( 20\pi = \pi r^2 \times 5 \) and solve for \( r \). Simplifying the equation, we get \( 20 = 5r^2 \), which gives us \( r = 2 \). Therefore,","[2, '2']",\sqrt{5},[],False
"To determine the maximum value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \( f(x) \) and ensure it is continuous and covers all possible horizontal values.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{se } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{se } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \( x \geq a \)
For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). The minimum value of \( f(x) \) in this interval is \( f(a) = a^3 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \( x < a \)
For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a straight line with  slope \( a \). The value of the function as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a \).

### Step 3: Ensure continuity at \( x = a \)
For the function to be continuous at \( x = a \), the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a).
\]
Substituting the expressions, we get:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]
Rearranging the equation:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]
Factoring out \( a \):
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 \):
\[
a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
a = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad  a = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Check the behavior of the function for \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \)
#### Case 1: \( a = 2 \)
For \( a = 2 \):
- For \( x \geq 2 \), \( f(x) = 2x^2 \).
- For \( x < 2 \), \( f(x) = 2x + 4 \).

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq 2 \) is \( f(2) = 8 \).

The value of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 2 from the left is:
\[
\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2(2) + 4 = 8.
\]

Since \( f(x) = 2x^2 \) for \( x \geq 2 \) covers all values from 8 to \(\infty\), and \( f(x) = 2x + 4 \) for \( x < 2 \) covers all values from \(-\infty\) to 8, the function The final answer is  \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So we can rewrite \( x^2 - 10x \) as:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6 \), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So we can rewrite \( y^2 + 6y \) as:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

This is the standard form of the equation of a circle \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the radius of the circle is 1, so:
\[  r = 1 \]
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]
Therefore, we have:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda(1 - x) = 1 \implies x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \ implies 0 \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda \geq 1.
\]
Thus, for \(\lambda \geq 1\), there is another fixed point \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) in addition to \(x = 0\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). We start by computing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\ ):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda x^2) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (\lambda x^2 - (1 + \lambda)x + 1) = 1.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 = 1 \implies \lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.

Applying this  formula, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
 We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]
Applying this formula, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,

and
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur at points where \( x = y \) or \( x = -y \).

Let's consider the case \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we can take the derivative of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
g'(x ) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.

We evaluate \( g(x) \) at these points and at the endpoints \( x = \pm 1 \):

g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 }} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 1,
\]
\[
g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -1,

"Per find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1  \end{vmatrix}.
\]
We expand this determinant:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right).
\]
Simplifying the components, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 +  4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}.
\]
The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}.
\]
Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\). \\

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). This implies \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This is the form of the cosine function, so we have:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z ^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( 2 \cos 85\theta \), we need to determine \( \theta \). Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we recognize that this is a specific value that corresponds to a known angle. However, we can use the periodicity of the cosine function to simplify our work. The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), and we need to find \( \cos 85\theta \).

Notice that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a known value in the context of the golden ratio. The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is related to the golden ratio, and  the powers of the golden ratio have periodic properties. Specifically, the powers of the golden ratio modulo 2\(\pi\) will repeat every 24 steps (this is a known property of the golden ratio in trigonometric contexts).

Therefore, \( 85 \theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will be the same as \( 85 \mod 24 = 1 \) multiple of \( \theta \). So \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

The final answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \( \triangle W G N \), we need to understand the geometric relationships and properties of the triangle and its medians. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the properties of the medians and the centroid:**
   - The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid \( G \), which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Specifically, \( AG:GD = BG:GE = CG:GF = 2:1 \).
   - The line passing through \( G \) and parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, and the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will create similar triangles with the same height-to bases ratio as the original triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

2. **Determine the ratio of the similar triangles:**
   - Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar by AA similarity (both share angle \( A \) and have corresponding angles equal  because of the parallel lines). The ratio of the sides of these similar triangles is the same as the ratio of the heights from \( A \) to \( MN \) and from \( A \) to \( BC \). Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Calculate the area of \( \triangle AMN \):**
   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its sides. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of \( \triangle ABC \). Given that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64 \ ).

4. **Determine the area of \( \triangle W G N \):**
   - Since \( MN \parallel BC \) and \( G \) is the centroid, \( W \) is the midpoint of \( MN \) (because \( G \) divides the median in a 2:1 ratio and \( G \) is the centroid, so \( W \) is the midpoint of \( MN \)). Therefore, \( \triangle W G N \) is similar to \( \triangle AMN \) with a ratio of \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since \( W \) is the midpoint of \( MN \)). The area of \( \triangle W G N \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the area of \( \triangle AMN \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle W G N \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \).

The area of triangle \( \triangle W G N \) is \( \boxed{16} \).```

"In a sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is called the common difference, denoted as \(d\). The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the 4th term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the 8th term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7 d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

"To determine how many integers \( n > 1 \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) in its prime factorized form.

"To determine how many nickels Hillary ha has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know that each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

 our goal is to find the number of nickels, \( n \). To do this, we need to express \( n \) in terms of \( d \):

\[ n = 15 - 2d \]

Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( d \) can take any integer value such that \( 15 - 2d \geq 0 \). This means:

\[ d \leq \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number, the possible  values for \( d \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Let's check each case to find the corresponding value of \( n \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \).
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \).
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \).
- If \( d = 6 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 6 = 3 \).
- If \( d = 7 \), then  \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 7 = 1 \).

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse select from the first \( n \) prime numbers is odd, we need to analyze the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum. The sum of a set of numbers is odd if and only if the count of odd numbers in the set is odd. This is because the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd. Adding any number of even numbers does not change the parity of the sum.

First, let's list the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

Notice that 2 is the only even prime number, and the rest are odd. Therefore, if Paul and Jesse select an even number of primes, the sum will be even if they select an even number of odd primes, and odd if they select an odd number of odd primes. If they select an odd number of primes, the sum will be odd if they select an odd number of odd primes, and even if they select an even number of odd primes.

Let's  denote the total number of primes by \( n \). If \( n = 2k \) (i.e., \( n \) is even), then there are \( 2k-1 \) odd primes and 1 even prime. If \( n = 2k+1 \) (i.e., \( n \) is odd), then there are \( 2k \) odd primes and 1 even prime.

### Case 1: \( n \) is even
If \( n = 2k \), the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes from \( 2k-1 \) odd primes is:
\[
\binom{2k-1}{1} + \binom{2k-1}{3} + \cdots + \binom{2k-1}{2k-1}
\]
This is half of the total number of ways to choose any number of odd primes from \( 2k-1 \) odd primes, because the binomial coefficients are symmetric. Therefore, the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes is:
\[
\frac{2^{2k-1}}{2} = 2^{2k-2 }
\]
The total number of ways to choose any subset of \( 2k-1 \) odd primes is \( 2^{2k-1} \). So the probability that the sum is odd is:
\[
\frac{2^{2k-2}}{2^{2k-1}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Case 2: \( n \) is odd
If \( n = 2k+1 \), the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes from \( 2k \) odd primes is:
\[
\binom{2k}{1} + \binom{2k}{3} + \cdots + \binom{2k}{2k-1}
\]
This is also half of the total number of ways to choose any number of odd primes from \( 2k \) odd primes. Therefore, the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes is:
\[
\frac{2^{2k}}{2} = 2^{2k-1}
\]
The total number of ways to choose any subset of \( 2k \) odd primes is \( 2^{2k} \). The final answer is :
\[
\frac{2^{2k-1}}{2^{2k}} = \frac{1}{2}

In both cases, the probability is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse select is odd is:

"To determine the smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 2 zeros, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 450 and has at least two trailing zeros. Trailing zeros in a number are produced by factors of 10, and each factor of 10 is the product of a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Therefore, we need to find the smallest multiple of 450 that includes at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

To have two trailing zeros, we need to multiply 450 by \(10^2 = 100\). This is because \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\), which provides the necessary factors of 2 and 5 to produce two trailing zeros.

Now, let's calculate:
\[ 450 \times 100 = 45000 \]

So, the smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 2 zeros is 45000.

 Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{45000}
\]```


```python

```


```python
import math

def smallest_multiple_of_450_ending_in_2_zeros():
    # Factorize 450
    factors_of_450 = [2, 3, 3, 5, 5]

    # To have two trailing zeros, we need to multiply 450 by 100
    additional_factors = [2, 2, 5, 5]

    # Multiply the factors together
    additional multiple = 1
    for factor in additional_factors:
        additional_multiple *= factor

    # The smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 2 zeros is 450 * additional_multiple
    smallest_multiple = 450 * additional_multiple

    return smallest_multiple

smallest_multiple = smallest_multiple_of_450_ending_in_2_zeros()
print(smallest_multiple)

This will output:

"To determine the probability that the coin has come up heads, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for the first number:**
   - The first number is determined by dividing by 4 and finding the remainder. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3.
   - This means the first number can be 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. There are 3 possible outcomes for the first number.

2. **Identify the possible outcomes for the second number:**
   - The second number is determined by dividing by 5 and finding the remainder. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - This means the second number can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. There are 4 possible outcomes for the second number.

3. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since the first number and the second number are independent of each other, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each number.
   - Total outcomes = 3 (outcomes for the first number) * 4 (outcomes  for the second number) = 12.

4. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   - The favorable outcome is when both the first number and the second number are odd.
   - For the first number to be odd, it can be 1 or 3 modulo 4. There are 2 favorable outcomes for the first number.
   - For the second number to be odd, it can be 1 or 3 modulo 5. There are 2 favorable outcomes for the second number.
   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (outcomes for the first number) * 2 (outcomes for the second number) = 4.

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Probability = \(\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the probability that the coin has come up heads is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

"To determine the sum of the digits in the numerator of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\), which can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction simplifies to:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus , the original product becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Therefore, the original product becomes:

"To determine the correct geometric shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates:

- \( z \) is the height above or below the \( xy \)-plane.

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and located at a distance \( c \) from the \( xy \)-plane. This plane extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, but it is simply a horizontal plane at height \( c \).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49}  = 7
\]
Now, substituting the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we get:

Simplifying, we find:

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

First, we need to find the roots of \( f(x) \). Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{\text{coefficient of } x^2}{\text{leading coefficient}} = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). If \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \) are the roots of \( f(x)  \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( \alpha - 5 \), \( \beta - 5 \), and \( \gamma - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we sum \( \alpha - 5 \), \( \beta - 5 \), and \( \gamma - 5 \):

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity for the cotangent function:
\[
\cot^2 \theta = \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} - 1.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression in terms of cotangent:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Since \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\),  we have:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]
Now, let's consider the expression \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\):
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
We need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). Using the identity \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\), we get :
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.

"1. Per convertire l' damaged angle in internal angles into the sum of all internal angles, we use the formula for the sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides:
   \[
   \text{Sum of internal angles} = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.

2. Let \( \alpha \) represent the damaged angle in internal angles. We are given that the sum of all internal angles except for the damaged angle is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   180(n-2) = 1070 + \alpha
   \]

3. To find \( n \), we first isolate \( \alpha \) by subtracting \( 1070 \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \alpha = 180(n-2) - 1070
   \]

4. Since \( \alpha \) must be a positive angle less than \( 180^\circ \), we set up the inequality:
   \[
   0 < \alpha  < 180
   \]
   Substituting \( \alpha \) from the previous step, we get:
   \[
   0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
   \]

5. Solving the inequality for \( n \):
   \[
   1070 < 180(n-2) < 1250
   \]
   Dividing through by 180:
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplifying the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]

6. Adding 2 to each part of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

7. Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round to the nearest integer:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

8. Finally, we calculate the sum of all internal angles for \(  n = 8 \):
   \[
   \text{Sum of internal angles} = 180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080 \text{ degrees}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of all internal angles of the polygon is \( \boxed{1080^\circ} \). This implies that the damaged angle \( \alpha \) is:
   \[
   \alpha = 1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ
   \] 
Thus, the damaged angle is \( 10^\circ \). Using this information, we conclude that Qu biavna could have a polygon with 8 sides, and the sum of all its internal angles is \( 1080^\circ \). Therefore, the answer to the problem is \( \boxed{8} \). This completes the solution. \(\blacksquare\)```

"Per determinareil prodottore di $5 + \sqrt{3}$ e di its coniugato radicale,Firstly we need to identify the coniugate of the given number. The coniugate of $5 + \sqrt{3}$ is $5 - \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we will find the product of these two numbers:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by simplifying the argument of the sine function.

First, recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because if \(\theta = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\), then \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(\tan \theta = x\), so \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right).
\]
We need to find the value of \(x\) such that \(\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\ ).

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then \(\tan \theta = x\) and we need to find \(\sin (2\theta)\). Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta.
\]
Since \(\tan \theta = x\), we can express \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\) in terms of \(x\). We know that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\) and \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = x\). Let \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Then:
\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
 We need this to be equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

"To determine whether the given lines are parallel and to find the distance between them, we will follow these steps:

1. **Check if the lines are parallel:**
   Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.

   The direction vector of the first line is:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   The direction vector of the second line is:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   We need to check if there exists a scalar \( k \) such that:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_2 = k \mathbf{d}_1
   \]

   Comparing the components:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   4 = 2k 
   \]
   \[
   -18 = -9k
   \]
   \[
   -4 = -2k
   \]

   Solving for \( k \) in each equation:
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{-18}{-9} = 2
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{-4}{-2} = 2
   \]

   Since \( k = 2 \) satisfies all three equations, the direction vectors are indeed scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, the lines are parallel.

2. **Find the distance between the parallel lines:**
   To find the distance between two parallel lines, we use the formula for the distance between a point on one line and the other line. Let's choose the point \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and the point \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) on the second line.

    The vector connecting \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 5 \\ -10 + 3 \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   The distance \( d \) between the two parallel lines is given by the formula:
   \[
   d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|}
   \]

   First, compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

"To determine the number of vertices with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the given rectangular region, we first identify the coordinates of the vertices.

The coordinates of the vertices are all integers, but we need to find the integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle, meaning they must satisfy \( -5 < x < 5 \) and \( -4 < y < 4 \).

The possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\), which gives us 8 possible values. The possible integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\), which gives us 7 possible values.

To find the total number of integer coordinates within the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible \(x\) values by the number of possible \(y\) values:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. We start by expanding the expression:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). This simplifies the expression to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{ c}.
\]

We can further simplify the terms involving scalar multiplication:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Also, we know that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\). Therefore, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7  \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

"To determine the average cost of the francobolli that Juan bought in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine the cost of each type of stamp.
3. Calculate the total cost for each country.
4. Sum the total costs from all countries.
5. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average cost.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Identify the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:**
   - Brazil: 8 stamps

   - France: 4 centesimes per stamp
   - Peru: 5 centesimes per stamp
   - Spain: 3 centesimes per stamp

3. **Calculate the total cost for each country:**

   - France: \( 15 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ centesimes_stamps} = 60 \text{ centesimes} \)
   - Peru: \( 10 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ centesimes_stamps} = 50 \text{ centesimes} \)
   - Spain: \( 9 \text{ stamps} \times 3 \text{ centesimes_stamps} = 27 \text{ centesimes} \)

4. **Sum the total costs from all countries:**

首先，我们注意到由于 \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\)，\(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\)。此外，由于 \(\overline{AC}\) 是 \(\angle BAD\) 的角平分线，\(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\)。

设 \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\)。那么 \(\angle CAD = \theta\) 且 \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\)，所以 \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ - \theta\)。

由于 \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\)，\(\angle BCA = \angle CAD = \theta\)（交替内角）。因此，在 \(\triangle ACD \) 中，\(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\)，\(\angle CAD = \theta\)，且 \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ - \theta\)。

梯形 \(ABCD\) 的面积由下式给出：
\[

\]
由于 \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\)，\(\triangle ACD\) 的面积为：
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD
\]

为了找到 \(\triangle ACD\) 的面积，我们需要确定 \(AC\) 和 \(CD\) 的长度。然而，我们可以利用三角形 \(ABC\) 和 \(ACD\) 共享相同的高 \(AC\) 的事实。设 \(AC = h\) 且 \(CD = b\)。那么 \(\triangle ACD\) 的面积为：
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot b
\]

由于 \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) 且 \(\overline{AC}\) 是 \(\angle BAD\) 的角平分线 ，\(\triangle ABC\) 和 \(\triangle ACD\) 共享相同的高 \(AC\) 的比例等于它们的底边的长度。因此，\(\triangle ACD\) 的面积与 \(\triangle ABC\) 的面积成比例。

已知梯形 \(ABCD\) 的面积为 42，且由于 \(\overline{AC}\) 是 \(\angle BAD\) 的角平分线，\(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\)，\(\triangle ACD\) 的面积为梯形面积的 \(\frac{1}{2}\)。

因此，\(\triangle ACD\) 的面积为：

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots.
2. **Simplify the resulting equation**.
3. **Solve for \(x\)**.
4. **Verify the solution** by substituting it back into the original equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Step 1: Square both sides of the equation.
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Step 2: Cross-multiply to clear the fraction.
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9 
\]

Step 3: Solve for \(x\).
First, isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
Then, divide both sides by \(-19\):
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Step 4: Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation.
First, calculate the left-hand side of the original equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac {3}{2}

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.

We need to find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the formula:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of the numerators and the fraction:

\[
(7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3,  so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

   - However, we calculated the area of the ombregians to be \(3\pi\). This discrepancy suggests that the angle \(\angle ADC\) is not directly related to the areas of the circles in the manner described. Instead, it might be related to the central angle subtended by the ombregians.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - The problem might be asking for the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the ombregians are equal to \(\frac{5 }{12}\) of the larger circle's area. This implies that the angle \(\angle ADC\) is a fraction of the full circle's angle (which is \(360^\circ\)) corresponding to the given area ratio.

6. **Calculate the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is a fraction of the full circle's angle that corresponds to the given area ratio. Since the area of the ombregians is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the larger circle's area, the angle \(\angle ADC\) must be \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the full circle's angle:
     \[
     \angle ADC = \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ
     \]

Therefore, the size of the smallest possible angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{150}\) degrees. \\\end{assistant}\\\

"To determine how many of the 8 cm height, 3 cm radius beeholes will be needed to fill a spherical shell of radius 6 cm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one beehole.
2. Calculate the volume of the spherical shell.
3. Determine how many beeholes are needed to fill the spherical shell.

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one beehole
The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

For one beehole:
\[ r = 3 \text{ cm}, \quad h = 8 \text{ cm} \]
\[ V_{\text{beehole}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the volume of the spherical shell
The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

 The volume of the spherical shell is the difference between the volume of a sphere with radius 6 cm and a sphere with radius 0 cm (which is effectively a point and has no volume):
\[ V_{\text{shell}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many beeholes are needed to fill the spherical shell
To find out how many beeholes are needed, we divide the volume of the spherical shell by the volume of one beehole:
\[ \text{Number of beeholes} = \frac{V_{\text{shell}}}{V_{\text{beehole}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of beeholes needed to fill the spherical shell is \(\boxed{4}\).```

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's define \(\theta = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\phi = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \theta = 0.4\) and \(\sin \phi = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\theta + \phi)\) and \(\sin (\phi - \theta)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\theta + \phi) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi
\]
\[
\sin (\phi - \theta) = \sin \phi \cos \theta - \cos \phi \sin \theta
\]

We already know \(\sin \theta = 0.4\) and \(\sin \phi = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \theta\)  and \(\cos \phi\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1\).

For \(\theta\):
\[
\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

For \(\phi\):
\[
\cos \phi = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
 \]

Now we can substitute \(\sin \theta\), \(\cos \theta\), \(\sin \phi\), and \(\cos \phi\) into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\theta + \phi) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\phi - \theta) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10 The final answer is :
\[

"To determine the speed of the bicycle in pollici per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the distance traveled from feet to pollici.
2. Determine the time taken in seconds.
3. Calculate the speed in pollici per second.

**Step 1: Convert the distance from feet to pollici.**

We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 pollici. Therefore, the distance of 20 feet is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ pollici/foot} = 240 \text{ pollici} \]

**Step 2: Determine the time taken in seconds.**

The time taken is given as 1 minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the time taken is:
\[ 1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the speed in pollici per second.**

Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{240 \text{ pollici}}{60  \text{ seconds}} = 4 \text{ pollici/second} \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members without any restrictions:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 14 \) and \( k = 5 \).
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that all members are from the same party:**
   - The number of ways to choose 5 members from the 8 repub equivalents is \( \binom{8}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
   \]
    - The number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 Democrats is \( \binom{6}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
   \]
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 5 members all from the same party is:
   \[
   56 + 6 = 62
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one member is from each party:**
   Subtract the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the same party from the total number of ways to choose 5 members.
   \[
   2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).```

1. **Isolate the cube root expression**: The equation is already in the form where the cube root expression is isolated.

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides**: To remove the cube root, we cube both sides of the equation.
   \[

   Simplifying both sides, we get:

3. **Simplify the quadratic equation**: The left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:

4. **Solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides**: Remember to consider both the positive and negative roots.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are related by powers of 2. Specifically, for \(n = 15\), we have the identity:

This identity can be derived from properties of roots of unity and the polynomial whose roots are the 15th roots of unity. Therefore, we have:

First, let's denote the length of \(AB = AC = x\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = y\). Then, in the right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[x^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies x^2 = 11^2 + y^2 \implies x^2 = 121 + y^2.\]

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). Now, we need to use the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\).  Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(D\) is on \(AM\) and the angles to apply the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\) and \(\triangle BDA\).

In \(\triangle BDA\), we have:
\[\angle BDA = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta.\]
Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDA\):
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AD}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{10}{\sin 3\theta}.\]
Since \(\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta) = \sin 3\theta\), we have:
\[BD = 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta}.\]

In \(\triangle BDC\), using the Law of Sines again:
\[\frac{BD}{\ sin (90^\circ - 2\theta)} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}.\]
Since \(\sin (90^\circ - 2\theta) = \cos 2\theta\), we have:
\[BD = BC \cdot \frac{\cos 2\theta}{\sin 3\theta}.\]
Since \(BC = 2y\), we get:
\[2y \cdot \frac{\cos 2\theta}{\sin 3\theta} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta} \implies 2y \cos 2\theta = 10 \sin \theta.\]
Using the double angle identity \(\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), we get:
\[2y (1 - 2\sin^2 \theta) = 10 \sin \theta.\]
Let \(z = \sin \theta\), then:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the sequence of integers be \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these 27 integers can be expressed as:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\) and the last term \(a+26\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a+26\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\ ]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we calculate:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative (it is a sum of squares and a non-negative term), it is always greater than \(-4\). Therefore, this inequality is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To solve this, we can rewrite the inequality as \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\). Let's define a new function \(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 - 21\). We need to find the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) < 0\).

First, find the critical points by solving \(f(x) = 0\):
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\).  Then the equation becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(y\). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard the negative solution. Therefore, \(y = 3\), which means  \(x^2 = 3\). So, \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

Now we need to determine the intervals where \(f(x) < 0\). The function \(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 - 21\) is a polynomial of even degree with a positive leading coefficient, so it opens upwards. Therefore, \(f(x) < 0\) between the roots \(x = -\sqrt{3}\) and \(x = \sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Since the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Given the equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx ).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Next, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
We can factor this as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Substituting the given value, we get:
 \[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s \left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s \left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
or
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine the degree at which the number of ma chiere that take the f');
intimate to 135% of the number of female students taking the bus, we need to calculate the ratio of male students to female students for each degree and compare it to 1.35 (since 135% is equivalent to 1.35).

Let's go through each degree step by step:

1. **9th degree:**
   - Number of male students: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
   - Number of female students: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.045\)
   - Since \(1.045 < 1.35\), the 9th degree does not meet the requirement.

2. **10th degree:**
   - Number of male students: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\)
   - Number of female students:  \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.039\)
   - Since \(1.039 < 1.35\), the 10th degree does not meet the requirement.

3. **11th degree:**
   - Number of male students: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
   - Number of female students: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.500\)
   - Since \(1.500 > 1.35\), the 11th degree meets the requirement.

4. **12th degree:**
   - Number of male students: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
   - Number of female students: \(300 \times  0.086 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.356\)
   - Since \(1.356 > 1.35\), the 12th degree meets the requirement.

Since both the 11th and 12th degrees meet the requirement, the smallest degree that meets the requirement is the 11th degree.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The absolute value in the numerator can be simplified as follows:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
Next, we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).
\]
Thus, the inequality is:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \) is always non-negative because it is an absolute value. Therefore, the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

Now, we need to determine when \(x(x-36) < 0\). This inequality is satisfied when \(x\) is between the roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\), which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). So, the solution to \(x(x-36) < 0\) is:
\[
0 < x < 36.
\]
However, we must also ensure that the denominator is not zero, which means \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36.
\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"1. **Identify the dimensions and the shape of the field:**
   - The field is a rectangle with semicircular ends.
   - The total length of the field is 400 meters.
   - The field consists of two straight lengths and two semicircular ends.

2. **Determine the straight lengths:**
   - Let the straight lengths be denoted as \( l \).
   - Since there are two straight lengths, the total length of the straight parts is \( 2l \).

3. **Determine the circumference of the semicircular ends:**
   - The total length of the field is the sum of the two straight lengths and the circumferences of the two semicircles.
   - The total length of the field is given as 400 meters, so:
     \[
     2l + \text{circumference of two semicircles} = 400
     \]

4. **Calculate the circumference of one semicircle:**
   - The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the field, which we will denote as \( w \).
   - The circumference of one semicircle is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{ 2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{w}{2} = \frac{\pi w}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, the circumference of two semicircles is:
     \[
     2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w
     \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total length:**
   - Substituting the circumference of the semicircles into the total length equation, we get:
     \[
     2l + \pi w = 400
     \]

6. **Express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):**
   - Solving for \( l \):
     \[
     l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}
     \]

7. **Calculate the area of the field:**
   - The area of the field consists of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles.
   - The area of the rectangle is:
     \[
     l \times w
     \]
   - The area of one semicircle is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\ right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{w^2}{4} = \frac{\pi w^2}{8}
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of two semicircles is:
     \[
     2 \times \frac{\pi w^2}{8} = \frac{\pi w^2}{4}
     \]
   - The total area \( A \) of the field is:
     \[
     A = l \times w + \frac{\pi w^2}{4}
     \]

8. **Substitute \( l \) into the area equation:**
   - Substituting \( l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \):

     A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi w}{2}\right) w + \frac{\pi w^2}{4}

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the curve given by the equation \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we need to minimize the distance function \(d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

First, substitute the expression for \(y\) into the distance function:
\[d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}.\]
This simplifies to:
\[d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}.\]
To minimize \(d\), we can minimize \(d^2\) instead:
\[d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}.\]
Let \(u = x^2\).  Then the function becomes:
\[f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}.\]
To find the minimum value of \(f(u)\), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[f'(u) = u - 2 = 0 \implies u = 2.\]
So, \(x^2 = 2 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{2}\). Substituting \(u = 2\) back into \(f(u)\) gives:
\[f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]
Thus, the minimum distance \(d\) is:
\[d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.\]

"To solve for \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

### Step 1: Find \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

#### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factor out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us:
 \[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not within the domain. Solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Multiply by \(-1\):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
Factorize:
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives:
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]
Since \( x > 3 \), neither \( x = 3 \) nor \( x = -1 \) are valid solutions.

Thus, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore:
\[ f^{-1}(0) = 3 \]

### Step 2: Find \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
\[ f(x) = 3 - x  \]
Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

#### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearrange:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
This is a cubic equation. To find the roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem or synthetic division. Testing possible rational roots, we find:
\[ x = 2 \]
However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Since \( x > 3 \) does not yield any valid solutions, we only have:
\[ f^{-1}(6) = -3 \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \)
 The final answer is :
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Given that the distances from a point \( P \) to five of the vertices of a regular octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, recall that a regular octahedron has 8 equilateral triangular faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be positioned in a coordinate system such that they are symmetrically distributed around the origin. For simplicity, we can place the vertices at \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\).

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A = (1, 0, 0) \), \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \), \( C = (0, 1, 0) \), \( D = (0, -1, 0) \), \( E = (0, 0, 1) \), and \( F = (0, 0, -1 ) \). Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \((x, y, z)\).

The distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and one of these distances is missing. We need to find the missing distance.

We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex, which is the vertex that is not \( P \), \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), or \( E \). This vertex must be \( F = (0, 0, 1) \) or \( (-1, 0, 0) \), but since \( PA = 3 \) and \( PB = 7 \), the missing distance must be the distance to the vertex that is not \( A \) or \( B \), which is \( F \).

The distance from \( P \) to \( F \) is:

Given that both Jack and Jen apply the same force to their respective balls, we can set up the following equations for the force on each ball:

For the p median of the softball:

\[ F = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \cdot a_{\text{ softball}} \]

For the p median of the baseball:
\[ F = m_{\text{ baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{ baseball}} \]
\[ F = 0.15 \, \text{kg} \cdot a_{\text{ baseball}} \]

Since the force \(F\) is the same for both, we can set the two expressions for \(F\) equal to each other:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg} \cdot a_{\text{ softball}}  = 0.15 \, \text{kg} \cdot a_{\text{ baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the accelerations, we can solve for \(a_{\text{ softball}} / a_{\text{ baseball}}\):
\[ \frac{a_{\text{ softball}}}{a_{\text{ baseball}}} = \frac{0.15 \, \text{kg}}{0.2 \, \text{kg}} \]
\[ \frac{a_{\text{ softball}}}{a_{\text{ baseball}}} = \frac{15}{20} \]

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is given by \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \).

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x) \):

"In order to find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the point and the line:**
   - Point: \(P = (6, 0)\)
   - Line: \(y = 2x - 2\)

2. **Use the distance formula from a point to a line:**
   The formula for the distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is:
   \[
   d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
   \]

3. **Rewrite the line equation in standard form:**
   The given line equation is \(y = 2x - 2\). We can rewrite it in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
   \[
   2x - y - 2 = 0
   \]
   Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

 4. **Substitute the coordinates of the point and the coefficients of the line into the distance formula:**
   \[
   d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression inside the absolute value:**
   \[
   d = \frac{|12 + 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
   \]

6. **Rationalize the denominator:**
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To determine the cost of one matita, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( M \) be the cost of one matita in cents.
- Let \( G \) be the cost of one gomma jumbo in cents.

We are given two equations based on the information provided:
1. Tre matite e one gomma jumbo cost \$1.24, which is 124 cents.
2.sinsete matite e one gomma jumbo cost \$1.82, which is 182 cents.

We can write these as:
\[
3M + G = 124
\]
\[
5M + G = 182
\]

To find \( M \), we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( G \):
\[
(5M + G) - (3M + G) = 182 - 124
\]
\[
5M + G - 3M - G = 58
\]
\[
2M = 58
\]
\[
M = \frac{58}{2}
\]
\[
M = 29
\]

Thus , the cost of one matita is \(\boxed{29}\) cents. To verify, we can substitute \( M = 29 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( G \). Using the first equation:
\[

\]
\[
87 + G = 124
\]
\[
G = 124 - 87

\[
G = 37

Now, we check the second equation:
\[

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that point \( O \) is closer to one of the vertices of the rectangle \( ABCD \) than to one of the other vertices. We start by analyzing the geometric properties of the rectangle and the distances from \( O \) to its vertices.

1. **Identify the vertices and the center:**
   - The rectangle \( ABCD \) has vertices \( A(-a, b) \), \( B(a, b) \), \( C(a, -b) \), and \( D(-a, -b) \).
   - The center \( O \) of the rectangle is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

2. **Calculate the distances from \( O \) to each vertex:**
   - The distance from \( O \) to \( A \) is \( OA = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
   - The distance from \( O \) to \( B \) is \( OB = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
   - The distance from \( O \) to \( C \) is \( OC = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
    - The distance from \( O \) to \( D \) is \( OD = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

   Since all distances from \( O \) to the vertices are equal, \( O \) is equidistant from all four vertices.

3. **Analyze the problem:**
   - The problem asks for the probability that \( O \) is closer to one of the vertices than to one of the other vertices. However, since \( O \) is equidistant from all vertices, it is impossible for \( O \) to be closer to one vertex than to another.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The probability that \( O \) is closer to one of the vertices than to one of the other vertices is \( 0 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the residue of 54 modulo 6, we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. This can be done through the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We perform the division:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the quotient \(q\) is 9 and the remainder \(r\) is 0. Therefore, we can write:

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]

This tells us that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In other words, 54 is a multiple of 6, so the residue of 54 modulo 6 is 0.

Thus, the residue of 54 modulo 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).```

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function \( f(n) \), which is \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- The ceiling of \( 1.0472 \) is \( 2 \), so \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708  \).
- Since \( 6.708 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function \( f(n) \), which is \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 6.708 \) is \( 6 \), so \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function \( f(n) \), which is \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 4 \) is \( 4 \), so \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we can sum the results:

1. Linda's earnings: \$27.47
2. Sherry's earnings: \$35.23
3. June's earnings: \$37.37
4. Connie's earnings: \$26.52

First, we add Linda's and Sherry's earnings:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70 \]

Next, we add June's earnings to the previous sum:
\[ 62.70 + 37.37 = 99.97 \]

Finally, we add Connie's earnings to the previous sum:
\[ 99.97 + 26.52 = 126.49 \]

The total amount of money they have is \$126.49. Since the problem asks for the total in centesimi, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[ 126.49 \times 100 = 12649  \text{ centes plants} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they have in centesze is \(\boxed{12649}\). Since the problem asks for the number of centesze remaining after converting to dollars, we can see that they have no money left over after converting to dollars, as the total amount in dollars and cents is exactly \$126.49.

\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\

\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[

\]
Solving for \( n \):
 \[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) makes the matrix a magic square by checking the sums of the columns and the diagonals.

The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the second column is:
\[

\]
The sum of the third column is:
\[

\]
The sum of the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3 ) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

The sum of the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

\[
d = \sqrt{(300)^2 + (400)^2}

Calculating inside the square root:

\[

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the relations \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term separately. Consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, but since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, we can use the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) to simplify the expression.

Notice that \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).  Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 - 1 - \omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Now, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\). Using the relation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can rewrite \(\omega(1 + \omega)\) as:
\[
\omega(1 + \omega)  = \omega + \omega^2 = \omega + (-1 - \omega) = -1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{-1}{-1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).

1. ** Route \( A \to B \to C \to D \to A \):**
   \[
   AB + BC + CD + DA = 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 20
   \]

2. ** Route \( A \to B \to D \to C \to A \):**
   \[
   AB + BD + DC + CA = 5 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 19
   \]

3. ** Route \( A \to C \to B \to D \to A  \):**
   \[
   AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 21
   \]

4. ** Route \( A \to C \to D \to B \to A \):**
   \[
   AC + CD + DB + BA = 6 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 19
   \]

5. ** Route \( A \to D \to B \to C \to A \):**
   \[
   AD + DB + BC + CA = 5 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 21
   \]

6. ** Route \( A \to D \to C \to B \to A \):**
   \[
   AD + DC + CB + BA = 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 20
   \]

### Comparison of Distances:
- Route \( A \to B \to C \to D \to A \): 20
- Route \( A \to B \to D \to C \to A \): 19
- Route \( A \to C \to B \to D \to A  \): 21
- Route \( A \to C \to D \to B \to A \): 19
- Route \( A \to D \to B \to C \to A \): 21
- Route \( A \to D \to C \to B \to A \): 20

The shortest distance among these routes is 19.

Therefore, the shortest possible distance that can be traveled to visit all four points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) is \(\boxed{19}\).\\
