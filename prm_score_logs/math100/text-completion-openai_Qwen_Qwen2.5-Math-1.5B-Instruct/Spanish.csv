"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Here, \(EF = 7\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\) and \(DF\) is the hypotenuse. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

From this equation, we can solve for \(DF\):

\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\), which is the adjacent side to angle \(D\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 
\]

\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]

\[
DE^2 = 51
\]

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).\\

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin**:
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i + 3i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i
   \]

2. ** Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise**:
   Rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \ ) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \):
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( z' = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \):
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i  = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. ** Translate back to the original position**:
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).```python

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root where possible.

First, let's factorize 242:
1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Now, factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not (since 121 is odd). Next, we check if 121 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Next, we check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5 , it is not divisible by 5. Next, we check if 121 is divisible by 7. Dividing 121 by 7 gives approximately 17.2857, which is not an integer, so 121 is not divisible by 7. Finally, we check if 121 is divisible by 11. Dividing 121 by 11 gives 11, which is an integer, so 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\):
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = 11 \sqrt{2 }
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different ways we can send 8�绀 around a table if 3 specific着实es (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) are always sent together. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Treat the group of 3 as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must always be sent together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 and the other 5הצלחת).

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange 6 units around a table is given by \((6-1)!\), which is the number of ways to arrange \(n\) objects in a circle, i.e., \((n-1)!\). So, we have:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]
   This is the number of ways to arrange the 6 units (the block and the other 5мент).

3. **Arrange the 3 individuals within the block**: Since the block consists of 3 individuals (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas)  and they can be arranged among themselves in any order, we need to multiply the number of arrangements of the units by the number of permutations of the 3 individuals. The number of permutations of 3 individuals is \(3!\):
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange the 3 individuals within the block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the number of different ways to send 8 TouchableOpacity around a table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are always sent together, is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that does not contain \(x\).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for \(T_k\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
 \]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k) - 2k}
\]

Simplify the exponent of \(x\):

\[
3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

So the general term becomes:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2 }\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
x^{15-5(3)} = x^0 = 1
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \times 1 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \times -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \times -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to determine if the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, we substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression:
\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 becomes:
\[
(4)(6)(1) = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]
 This means that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not divisible by 7.

"A pentagon is a five-sided polygon. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, we need to determine the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The total sum of the angles around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since the pentagon is regular, each rotation that brings it back to its original position must be a fraction of this total sum. Specifically, the smallest such fraction is 360 degrees divided by 5, because there are five identical sections in a full circle.

So, the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the number of degrees that must rotate the pentagon to bring it back to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).```

"To solve for the value of \( x + y \) in the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2 } \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \( D \) are \( (6, -1) \). However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Since \( x = 6 \) does not satisfy this condition, we need to consider the possibility of a different configuration of the  vertices.

Let's consider the other possible configuration where \( B \) and \( C \) are the endpoints of one diagonal, and \( A \) and \( D \) are the endpoints of the other diagonal. The midpoint of \( BC \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

The midpoint of \( AD \) must be the same:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2.  Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}\), we get the eigenvalues:
\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16, \quad \lambda_2  = \frac{2}{2} = 1

The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all vectors \(\bold{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\) is:
\[
C = 4

The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3  \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1. \]

Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

\[ \boxed{-1}. \]```
This is the final answer. The value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Adding these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]
So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9  = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Adding these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]
So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the final answer is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Thus, we rewrite the second fraction with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Therefore,  the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is:

\[

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4

\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[

\[

\[

\[

\[

\[

Now, combine all these terms:

\[

\]

Group the like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients  of corresponding powers of \(t\):

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The tank is a cylinder with circular bases.
   - The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) liters per hour.
   - As the tank is being filled, the water level rises by 4 cm per hour.

2. **Convert the flow rate to cubic centimeters per hour:**
   - 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters (cm³).
   - Therefore, \(20\pi\) liters per hour is equivalent to \(20\pi \times 1000 = 20000\pi\) cm³ per hour.

3. **Relate the flow rate to the rate of change of the water level:**
   - The volume of water added per hour (\(V\)) is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank (\(A\)) multiplied by the height of water added per hour (\(h\)).
   - Mathematically, this is expressed as:
     \[
     V = A \times h
     \]
   - Here, \(V = 20000\pi \) cm³/hour and \(h = 4\) cm/hour.

4. **Solve for the cross-sectional area \(A\):**
   \[
   20000\pi = A \times 4
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{20000\pi}{4} = 5000\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

5. **Relate the cross-sectional area to the radius of the tank:**
   - The cross-sectional area \(A\) of a cylinder with circular bases is given by the formula for the area of a circle, \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the tank.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \pi r^2 = 5000\pi
     \]

6. **Solve for the radius \(r\):**
   \[
   r^2 = 5000
   \]
   \[
   r = \sqrt{5000} = \sqrt{5000} = \sqrt{100 \times 50} = 10\sqrt{50 } = 10\sqrt{25 \times 2} = 10 \times 5\sqrt{2} = 50\sqrt{2}

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its properties.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as:
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = 0\), but we are only interested in \(x \geq a\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).  If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing. If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing. The y-intercept of this line is \(2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the continuity at \(x = a\)
For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\).

\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)
\]

From the left:
\[
f(a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a
\]

From the right:
\[
f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3
\]

Setting these equal gives:
\[
a^3 = a^2 + 2a
\]

### Step 4: Solve the equation \(a^3 = a^2 + 2a\)
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0
\]

Factor out \(a\):
\[
 a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0
\]

This gives:
\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1
\]

### Step 5: Determine the valid values of \(a\)
We need to ensure that \(a\) is positive because the parabola \(ax^2\) must be non-negative for \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\).

### Step 6: Verify the maximum value of \(a\)
The only positive solution is \(a = 2\). We need to check if \(a = 2\) ensures that each horizontal line intersects the graph at least once.

For \(a = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
 \[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is 6, divide it by 2 to get 3, and then square it to get 9. So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed square terms on one side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right side of the equation must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\).  Therefore, we set \( 34 - c = 1 \) and solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

So, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) and the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\).

First, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We need this to be equal to \(x\), so we set up the equation:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
Expanding the left-hand side,  we get:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,\]
\[\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x - x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,\]
\[\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x - \lambda^2 x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[-\lambda^4 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - (\lambda^3 + \lambda^2)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) that is not a fixed point of \(f\) (i.e., \(f(x) \neq x\)), the cubic equation must have a root in the interval \((0,1)\) that is not a root of the equation \(f(x) = x\).

The equation \(f (x) = x\) is:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x,\]
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us the solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\), which simplifies to \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 2\).

Now, we need to check if there are any other values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) that satisfy the condition. By analyzing the cubic equation and the behavior of the function \(f(x)\), we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) that ensures a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the product-to-sum identities and the angle addition formulas. Notice that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos(A + B).
\ ]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can again use the product-to-sum identities and the angle addition formulas. Notice that:
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin  B = \sin(A + B).
\]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,

"To determine how many trailing zeros are in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the following method to count the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):

1. Count the multiples of 5.
2. Count the multiples of \(5^2 = 25\).
3. Count the multiples of \(5^3 = 125\), but since \(125 > 42\), we do not need to consider this and higher powers of 5.

Let's perform these steps:

1. **Count the multiples of 5:**
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   There are 8 multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42.

2. **Count the multiples of 25:**
    \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   There is 1 multiple of 25 in the numbers from 1 to 42.

3. **Count the multiples of 125:**
   Since \(125 > 42\), there are no multiples of 125 in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Now, we sum the counts:
\[
8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```python

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur at points where \( x = y \). Let's test this by setting \( x = y \):

\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]

Now, we need to maximize the function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:

\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{ 1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[ 2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

We evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):

\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to use the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), the cross product is:

\[

\[

由于 \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha \)，我们可以考虑 \( z \) 作为复平面上单位圆上的复数，所以 \( z = e^{i\theta} \) 对于某个角度 \( \theta \)。那么 \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \)，我们有：

我们需要找到 \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{ z^{85}} \)。由于 \( z = e^{i\theta} \)，我们有 \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) 和 \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \)。因此：
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

注意到 \( \cos(85\theta ) \) 的周期为 \( 2\pi \)，所以我们可以考虑 \( 85\theta \mod 2\pi \)。由于 \( \alpha \) 是黄金比例，角度 \( \theta \) 是黄金比例的角度，而 \( 85\theta \) 模 \( 2\pi \) 将导致一个与 \( \theta \) 相同的余弦值，但可能具有不同的三角函数形式。然而，由于黄金比例的对称性和周期性，我们可以利用黄金比例的性质和我们对称的复数单位圆来得出结论：

因此：
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \alpha. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle. Let's start by noting that the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Since the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) and \( AC \) at points \( M \) and \( N \) respectively, \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \). The ratio of similarity is the same as the ratio of the segments into which \( G \) divides the medians, which is 1:2 (since \( G \) is the centroid and divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio).

This means that the height of \( \triangle AMN \) is one-third the height of \( \triangle ABC \), and the base \( MN \) is one-third the base \( BC \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of \(  \triangle ABC \).

Given that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16

Now, we need to find the area of \( \triangle AGN \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides \( \triangle ABC \) into three triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ABG \) is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48\). Since \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) and the line \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \), the area of \( \triangle AGN \) is the same as the area of \( \triangle AMN \), which is 16.

Thus, the area of \( \triangle AGN \) is:

We can write the equations for the 4th and 8th terms as follows:

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

"To determine for which positive integer $n > 1$ the number $2^{24}$ is a perfect $n$-th power, we need to express $2^{24}$ in the form $k^n$ where $k$ is an integer. This means that the exponent 24 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, we need to find all the divisors of 24.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since $n > 1$, we exclude 1 from the list. Thus, the possible values for $n$ are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

We can verify each of these values:
- If $n = 2$, then $2^{24} = (2^{12})^2$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 2nd power.
- If $n = 3$, then $2^{24} = (2^8)^3$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 3rd power.
 - If $n = 4$, then $2^{24} = (2^6)^4$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 4th power.
- If $n = 6$, then $2^{24} = (2^4)^6$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 6th power.
- If $n = 8$, then $2^{24} = (2^3)^8$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 8th power.
- If $n = 12$, then $2^{24} = (2^2)^{12}$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 12th power.
- If $n = 24$, then $2^{24} = (2^1)^{24}$, so $2^{24}$ is a perfect 24th power.

Therefore, the positive integer values of $n > 1$ for which $2^{24}$ is a perfect $n$-th power are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

"To determine how many nickels Susie has, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.
2. The total number of coins is 11.

The value of the quarters, dimes, and nickels can be expressed in cents as follows:
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents.
- Each nickel is worth 5 cents.

So, the total value equation is:
\[ 25q + 10d + 5n = 75 \]

And the total number of coins equation is:
\[ q + d + n = 11 \]

We can simplify the total value equation by dividing everything by 5:
\[ 5q + 2d + n = 15 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 5q + 2d + n = 15 \)
2.  \( q + d + n = 11 \)

We can eliminate \( n \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (5q + 2d + n) - (q + d + n) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 4q + d = 4 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ d = 4 - 4q \]

Since \( d \) must be a non-negative integer, \( q \) can only be 0 or 1 (because if \( q \) were 2 or more, \( d \) would be negative).

Let's check these cases:

**Case 1: \( q = 0 \)**
\[ d = 4 - 4(0) = 4 \]
Substituting \( q = 0 \) and \( d = 4 \) into the second equation:
\[ 0 + 4 + n = 11 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

So, if \( q = 0 \), \( d = 4 \), and \( n = 7 \), let's check the total value:
\[ 25(0) + 10(4) +  5(7) = 0 + 40 + 35 = 75 \]
This satisfies the total value condition.

**Case 2: \( q = 1 \)**
\[ d = 4 - 4(1) = 0 \]
Substituting \( q = 1 \) and \( d = 0 \) into the second equation:
\[ 1 + 0 + n = 11 \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, if \( q = 1 \), \( d = 0 \), and \( n = 10 \), let's check the total value:
\[ 25(1) + 10(0) + 5(10) = 25 + 0 + 50 = 75 \]
This also satisfies the total value condition.

"The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers they choose. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

First, let's identify the even and odd numbers among the first six prime numbers:
- Even: 2
- Odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

There is 1 even number and 5 odd numbers.

The total number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even.  This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

** scenario 1: Both numbers are even**
There is only 1 even number, so there is:
\[
\binom{1}{2} = 0
\]
ways to choose 2 even numbers.

** scenario 2: Both numbers are odd**
There are 5 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers is:
\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Adding the number of favorable outcomes:
\[
0 + 10 = 10
\]

The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is:

- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

We will use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of zeros and ones, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's consider each of these conditions separately:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in an even digit. Since we are only using the digits 0 and 1, the number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9. Since the only digit we can use that is not 0 is 1, the number must contain a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9. This means the number must contain at least 9 ones.
3. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since we are only using the digits 0 and 1, the number  must end in 00.

Combining these conditions, the number must end in 00 and contain at least 9 ones. The smallest such number is 11111111100. Let's verify that this number meets all the criteria:

- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits is \(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9\), which is a multiple of 9.
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.

Since 11111111100 meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of zeros and ones. Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{11111111100}

"To determine the probability that the book is placed in a shaded square of the board, we need to understand the structure of the board and the possible outcomes of the numbers rolled on the wheels.

The total number of squares on the board is \(3 \times 4 = 12\). The number of shaded squares is 4. Therefore, the probability that the book is placed in a shaded square is the ratio of the number of shaded squares to the total number of squares.

The denominator can be written as:

Thus, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{10^7} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4321}{10^7} \cdot 0.5.\]

Next, we calculate \(\frac{4321}{10^7}\):
\[\frac{4321}{10^7} = 0.0004321.\]
Then, we multiply by 0.5:
\[0.0004321 \cdot 0.5 = 0.00021605.\]

 The last digit of the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is the last digit of 0.00021605, which is 5.

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This means that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

First, let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). This means that:
\[ f(r_1) = 0, \quad f(r_2) = 0, \quad f(r_3) = 0. \]
The function \( g(x) \) is defined as \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). Therefore, if \( s_1, s_2, s_3 \) are the roots of \( g(x) \), then:
\[ g(s_1) = 0, \quad g(s_2) = 0, \quad g(s_3) = 0. \]
This implies:
\[ f(s_1 + 5) = 0, \quad f(s_2 + 5) =  0, \quad f(s_3 + 5) = 0. \]
So, \( s_1 + 5, s_2 + 5, s_3 + 5 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \). That is, the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) and they are related to the roots of \( g(x) \) by:
\[ s_1 + 5 = r_1, \quad s_2 + 5 = r_2, \quad s_3 + 5 = r_3. \]
Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( s_1 = r_1 - 5, s_2 = r_2 - 5, s_3 = r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in \( f(x) \) with a sign change, according to Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015  \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is 49. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]
Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ \boxed{34} \] 
(Recall the transformation applied and the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \)).

This result is consistent with the transformation applied in the problem: a shift of 5 units to the left, which subtracts \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) from the sum of the roots of the original polynomial, confirming the final answer. Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is indeed \(\boxed{34}\).}.

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). However, a more useful identity for this problem is related to the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x\). Let's consider the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sine and cosine functions.

We know that:
\[
\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x .
\]
So, we can rewrite \(\sec^2 10^\circ\) as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Now, let's use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sine and cosine functions. We have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x}.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x} = \frac{4}{(2 \sin x \cos x)^2} = \frac{4}{4 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x } = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x}.
\]

Now, we need to find a way to combine these terms. Notice that:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ},
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 40^\circ} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 80^\circ}.
\]
But we only need the first two terms. Using the identity again, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ} - \frac{1}{\cos^2 20^\circ},
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 80^\circ} - \frac{1}{\cos^2 40^\circ}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of the interior angles of all but one of its angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of the Polygon with One Angle missing:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles of the remaining angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Range of \(x\):**
    Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set Up the Inequality:**
   Substitute the expression for \(x\) into the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the Inequality:**
   Break it into two separate inequalities:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ

   - For the first inequality:
     \[
     (n-2) \times 180^\circ > 1070^\circ

     \[
     n-2 > \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}

      \[
     n-2 > 5.9444
     \]
     \[
     n > 7.9444

     Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
     \[
     n \geq 8
     \]

   - For the second inequality:
     \[
     (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
     \]
     \[
     n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

     n-2 < 6.9444

   Combining the results from both inequalities, we get:

   8 \leq n \leq 8

"To determine the surface area in square inches of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the volume of 1 cubic foot is equivalent to \(12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728\) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the side length of the cube in inches:**
   The volume of a cube is given by the cube of its side length. Let \(s\) be the side length in inches. Then, \(s^3 = 1728\). Taking the cube root of both sides, we get \(s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12\) inches.

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \(A\) of a cube with side length \(s\) is given by \(A = 6s^2\). Substituting \(s = 12\) inches, we get \(A = 6 \times 12^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864\) square inches .

"To calculate the product of the number $5 + \sqrt{3}$ and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of $5 + \sqrt{3}$. The conjugate of a number of the form $a + \sqrt{b}$ is $a - \sqrt{b}$. Therefore, the conjugate of $5 + \sqrt{3}$ is $5 - \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we need to find the product of $5 + \sqrt{3}$ and $5 - \sqrt{3}$. This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$. Here, $a = 5$ and $b = \sqrt{3}$.

Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Calculating the squares, we have:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the arguments of the trigonometric functions.

First, recall the identity \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\). This identity holds because \(\cot^{-1} y = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)\), and substituting \(y = \frac{1}{x}\) gives \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
or
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

 Next, let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\sin (2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), we substitute \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). This gives:
\[
2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

To ensure these solutions are valid, we need to check the domain of the original equation. The domain of \(\tan^{-1} (x)\) and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) is all real numbers except zero, and the solutions \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are both positive, so they are valid.

The integer points strictly within the rectangle must satisfy the conditions:

To find the total number of integer points strictly within the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible \(x\) values by the number of possible \(y\) values:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, we will expand the expression as follows:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the segments as follows:
- Let \(AB = a\),
- Let \(BC = b\),
- Let \(CD = c\),
- Let \(DA = d\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\) when considering \(\overline{CD}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) as bases respectively. Let's denote the length of \(\overline{AC}\) as \(h\).

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\ ):
\[
[ABCD] = [ACD] + [ACB]
\]
The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]
The area of \(\triangle ACB\) is:
\[
[ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
Thus, the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times (b + c)
\]
We know that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times h \times (b + c) = 42
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
h \times (b + c) = 84
\]
The  area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]
Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\) have the same height \(h\) and their bases are \(c\) and \(b\) respectively. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) because the height \(h\) is the same and the base \(c\) is part of the total base \(b + c\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]
Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To determine the probability that two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   When four points are chosen on a circle, there are exactly three ways to pair them into two chords. For example, if the points are labeled in clockwise order as \(A, B, C, D\), the chords can be paired as \(AB\) and \(CD\), \(AC\) and \(BD\), or \(AD\) and \(BC\). Out of these three pairings, only one of them, \(AB\) and \(CD\), will result in the chords intersecting.

2. **Counting the Pairings**:
   The total number of ways to pair the four points into two chords is given by the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first chord, which is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\). However, since the order of the chords does not matter, we divide by 2, giving us \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) unique pairings .

     \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
      \]

4. **Understand the geometric configuration:**
   - The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle.
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtended by the arc in the larger circle.

5. **Calculate the area of the segment in the larger circle:**
   - The segment in the larger circle is a sector minus the triangle formed by the radii and the chord.
   - Let \(\theta\) be the central angle in radians.
   - The area of the sector in the larger circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{sector, large}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
     \]
   - The triangle in the larger circle is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(2\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of the triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{triangle, large}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta)
     \]
   -  Therefore, the area of the segment in the larger circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{segment, large}} = 2\theta - 2 \sin(\theta)
     \]

6. **Calculate the area of the segment in the smaller circle:**
   - The segment in the smaller circle is also a sector minus the triangle formed by the radii and the chord.
   - The central angle in the smaller circle is the same as in the larger circle, \(\theta\).
   - The area of the sector in the smaller circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{sector, small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
     \]
   - The triangle in the smaller circle is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(1\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of the triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{triangle, small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)

"To determine how many vases of water are needed to fill an spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the individual vase and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of one vase.

First, let's calculate the volume of one of the vases. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the vase, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
V_{\text{vase}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \(  r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

To find out how many vases are needed to fill the tank, we divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one vase:
\[
\text{Number of vases} = \frac{V_{\text{tank}}}{V_{\text{vase}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of vases needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).``````

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\). The step-by-step reasoning is provided to show how the volumes of the vases and the spherical tank are calculated and how the ratio is used to determine the number of vases needed.

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Next, we use the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Thus, the expression we need to evaluate becomes:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta )(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha).
\]
This is a product of a sum and a difference, which can be expanded using the difference of squares:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha) = \sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \alpha.
\]
Now, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\):
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84,
\]
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1  - 0.25 = 0.75.
\]
So, \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{0.84}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{0.75}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \alpha = (0.5)^2 (0.84) - (0.75) (0.4)^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.84 - 0.75 \cdot 0.16 = 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09.

"To determine the speed of the bicycle in inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the distance from pies to inches:**
   - We know that 1 pie is equal to 12 inches.
   - Therefore, 20 pies is equal to \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) inches.

2. **Convert the time from minutes to seconds:**
   - We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, 10 minutes is equal to \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) seconds.

3. **Calculate the speed in inches per second:**
   - Speed is given by the formula: \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \).
   - Substituting the values we have: \( \text{Speed} = \frac{240 \text{ inches}}{600 \text{ seconds}} \).

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   - \( \frac{240}{600} = \frac{240 \div 120}{600 \div  120} = \frac{2}{5} \).

Therefore, the speed of the bicycle is \( \frac{2}{5} \) inches per second.

The final answer is \( \boxed{\frac{2}{5}} \).```

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomunit of 5 members from a group of 8 coins and 6 cans, with the condition that the subcomunit must include at least one coin and one can, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 items (8 coins + 6 cans):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

2. Subtract the number of ways to choose 5 members that are all coins (i.e., no cans) and the number of ways to choose 5 members that are all cans (i.e., no coins):
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[

\]

Next, we are given that the product of these three integers divided by their mean is 24. The mean of the three integers is:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n

According to the problem, the product divided by the mean is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24

This simplifies to:

"To find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096 
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root gives both a positive and a negative solution:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]
\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \( x = 66 \) and \( x = -62 \). The problem asks for the value of \( x \) (not necessarily indicating which one), so we can present either solution. Conventionally, we might present the positive solution first.

The value of \( x \) is:

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). So the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]
This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly.

Thus, we have:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4  \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Then \(BC = 2x\).

Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\):
\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.\]

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts and solve each part separately.

### Part 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\).

1. Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\) because they are even powers of \(x\).
2. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\).

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) is always true, it is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

### Part 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

1. Let \(y = x^2\).  Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\).
2. Rearrange the inequality to form a standard quadratic inequality: \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\).

Now, solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points.

3. Use the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2 } = -7
   \]

4. The critical points are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) and consider only \(y = 3\).

5. Test the intervals determined by \(y = 3\) in the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\):
   - For \(0 \leq y < 3\), choose \(y = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 + 4 \cdot 0 - 21 = -21 < 0
     \]
   - For \(y > 3\), choose \(y = 4\):
     \[
     4^2 + 4 \cdot 4 - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0
     \]

Thus, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is satisfied for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

6. Recall that \(y = x^2\). The final answer is :
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]

7. Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   0 \leq x < \sqrt{3}
   \]
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x \leq 0
   \]

Combining these intervals, we get:

which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx ).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Next, we use the given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(x+y+z = s\), we have:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12,
\]
or
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz =  12.
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
s p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Thus,
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
and
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[

"To determine the年级 where the number of planelets in 500 is higher than 135% of the number of planelets in 500, we need to analyze the data provided in the table and calculate the number of planelets for each grade.

First, let's calculate the number of planelets in 500 for each grade:

1. For the 9th degree:
   \[
   \text{Number of planelets} = 300 \times 0.411 = 123.3
   \]

2. For the 10th degree:
   \[
   \text{Number of planelets} = 300 \times 0.344 = 103.2
   \]

3. For the 11th degree:
   \[
   \text{Number of planelets} = 300 \times 0.206 = 61.8
   \]

4. For the 12th degree:
   \[
   \text{Number of planelets} = 300 \times 0.116 = 34.8
   \]

 Next, we need to find the grade where the number of planelets (in 500) is greater than 135% of the number of planelets in 500 in the corresponding grade. We do this by comparing the number of planelets in 500 to 1.35 times the number of planelets in 500 for each grade.

1. For the 9th degree:
   \[
   1.35 \times 123.3 = 166.955 \quad \text{and} \quad 123.3 < 166.955
   \]
   So, the number of planelets in 500 is not greater than 135% of the number of planelets in 500.

2. For the 10th degree:
   \[
   1.35 \times 103.2 = 139.68 \quad \text{and} \quad 103.2 < 139.68
   \]
   So, the number of planelets in 500 is not greater  than 135% of the number of planelets in 500.

3. For the 11th degree:
   \[
   1.35 \times 61.8 = 83.73 \quad \text{and} \quad 61.8 < 83.73
   \]
   So, the number of planelets in 500 is not greater than 135% of the number of planelets in 500.

4. For the 12th degree:
   \[
   1.35 \times 34.8 = 47.16 \quad \text{and} \quad 34.8 < 47.16
   \]
   So, the number of planelets in 500 is not greater than 135% of the number of planelets in 500.

Since none of the grades satisfy the condition, the answer is that there is no such grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative if the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the expression will be negative if the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. This happens when \(x\) and \(x-36\) have opposite signs, which means \(x\) is between 0 and 36 (not including  0 and 36).

So, we need to exclude the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36\]

Thus, the solution is:
\[\boxed{(0, 36)}\]```


The final answer is \(\boxed{(0, 36)}\). This is the interval where the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) holds true. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\), making the entire fraction negative in this interval. The points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) are excluded because they make the denominator zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the solution is the open interval \((0, 36)\). This is the final answer.

"1. **Define the variables:**
   Let the width of the field be denoted by $x$ meters. The length of the field is given as 400 meters.

2. **Determine the radius of the semicircles:**
   Since the semicircles are inscribed within the field, the radius of each semicircle is half the width of the field. Thus, the radius $r$ is:
   \[
   r = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the semicircles:**
   The area of one semicircle is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting $r = \frac{x}{2}$, we get:
   \[
   \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{\pi x^2}{8}
   \]
   Since there are two semicircles, the total area  of the semicircles is:
   \[
   \text{Total area of semicircles} = 2 \times \frac{\pi x^2}{8} = \frac{\pi x^2}{4}
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   The area of the rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 400 \times x = 400x
   \]

5. **Calculate the total area of the land area:**
   The total area $A$ of the land area (including the semicircles) is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the semicircles:
   \[
   A = 400x + \frac{\pi x^2}{4}
   \]

6. **Find the value of $x$ that maximizes the area:**
   To maximize the area, we take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dx} = 400 + \frac{\pi x}{2}
    \]
   Setting the derivative equal to zero:
   \[
   400 + \frac{\pi x}{2} = 0
   \]
   Solving for $x$:
   \[
   \frac{\pi x}{2} = -400
   \]
   \[
   \pi x = -800
   \]
   \[
   x = -\frac{800}{\pi}
   \]
   Since $x$ must be a positive value, we discard the negative solution and re-evaluate the critical points within the feasible range.

7. **Re-evaluate the critical points:**
   Given the physical constraints, we need to find a positive $x$ that maximizes the area. This can be done by considering the boundary conditions or using calculus to find the correct maximum point. Given the problem's context, we should re-evaluate the steps and constraints.

8. **Correct the approach to find the maximum area:**
   The correct approach should consider the maximum area within the feasible range, which involves solving the quadratic equation correctly.

"To determine the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by using the given information and properties of right triangles.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle S\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles, meaning:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

We know the sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle{RST}\), we can find the length of \(RS\):
\ [
RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2
\]
\[
RS^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]
\[
RS^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2
\]
\[
RS^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In \(\triangle{RST}\), \(\angle T\) is opposite to side \(RS\) and adjacent to side \(ST\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k}

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To solve the problem of finding the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(d\) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \(d\), we minimize the function inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). Let \( u = x^2 \), then \( f(x) \) becomes:

\[
g(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( g(u) \), take the derivative with respect to \( u \) and set it to zero:

\[
g'(u)  = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2u - 2 = u - 2
\]

Setting \( g'(u) = 0 \):

\[
u - 2 = 0 \implies u = 2
\]

Thus, \( x^2 = 2 \) implies \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). Substituting \( x = \sqrt{2} \) (or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)) back into the distance formula, we get:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}

Calculate the distance from the origin to the point \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\):

   - We need to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
   - For $x \leq 3$, we have $f(x) = 3 - x$. Setting $3 - x = 0$ gives $x = 3$.
   - For $x > 3$, we have $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x$. Setting $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$ simplifies to $x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0$. The solutions are $x = 0$ (which is not in the domain $x > 3$) and the roots of $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we get $x = 3$ or $x = -1$ (which is not in the domain $x > 3$).
   - Hence, $f^{-1}(0) = 3$ since $f(3) = 0$.

2. **Determine $ f^{-1}(6)$:**
   - We need to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 6$.
   - For $x \leq 3$, we have $f(x) = 3 - x$. Setting $3 - x = 6$ gives $x = -3$.
   - For $x > 3$, we have $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x$. Setting $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$ simplifies to $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0$. This equation does not have any real solutions in the domain $x > 3$.
   - Hence, $f^{-1}(6) = -3$ since $f(-3) = 6$.

   - Mass of the ball of Jack: \( m_K = 150 \) g
   - The force applied to both balls is the same.

2. **Use Newton's second law:**
   According to Newton's second law, the force \( F \) applied to an object is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \):

   - For the ball of Jack:

4. **Since the force \( F \) is the same for both balls, we can set the two equations equal to each other:**

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to express \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) into \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

So, substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(1) \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

First, we substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x-1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

 Now, we evaluate \( f(0) \) using the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2  + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator becomes:

\[
|10| = 10
\]

Next, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots of this polynomial by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\),
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\),
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\ ),
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\).

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively. We know that:

\[
A + B + C = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
A + B + C = 0.
 \]

To find the individual values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), we can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials. Let's assume the polynomial can be factored as:

\[
(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.
\]

By comparing coefficients with \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), we get:

1. \(a + c = 2\),
2. \(ac + b + d = 0\),
3. \(ad + bc = 0\),
4. \(bd = 2\).

From the first equation, we have \(c = 2 - a\). Substituting \(c = 2 - a\) into the second equation, we get:

"To determine the cost of a writablepiz, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of aجتماعيةpiz in cents.
- Let \( g \) be the cost of a gume de b conflicting jumbo in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( p + g = 124 \) (since \$1.24 is equivalent to 124 cents)
2. \( 2p + g = 182 \) (since \$1.82 is equivalent to 182 cents)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):

\[
(2p + g) - (p + g) = 182 - 124
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
2p + g - p - g = 182 - 124
\]

This reduces to:

\[
p = 58
\]

Now that we have the value of \( p \),  we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( g \):

\[
p + g = 124
\]

Substituting \( p = 58 \) into the equation, we get:

\[
58 + g = 124
\]

Solving for \( g \), we subtract 58 from both sides:

\[
g = 124 - 58

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\):
\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

To verify this, we can multiply \(0.274\) by \(500\):
\[
0.274 \times 500 = 137
\]

Since the multiplication confirms the conversion, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is indeed \(0.274\).

Now, we identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in \(0.274\):
- The digits to the right of the decimal point are \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\).
- All of these digits are non-zero.

The last non-zero digit is \(4\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit to  the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions defined by the distances.

1. **Identify the Center and Vertices:**
   - The center \(O\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is the midpoint of the diagonals, so its coordinates are \((0, 0)\).
   - The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

2. **Define the Distance Function:**
   - The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
   - The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A = (-a, b)\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\).
   - Similarly, the distances to the other vertices are:
     - To \(B = (a, b)\): \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2  + (y - b)^2}\)
     - To \(C = (a, -b)\): \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\)
     - To \(D = (-a, -b)\): \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\)

3. **Set Up the Inequality:**
   - We need to find the region where the distance to the center is less than the distance to any vertex. This gives us the inequalities:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
     \]

4. **Simplify the Inequalities: **
   - Squaring both sides of each inequality, we get:

     \[

First, we evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the second case of the function:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than 4, we use the first case of the function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45 }) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, we evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
First, we calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \). Therefore,
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = f(4) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- Sherry's payment: $35.23 = 3523$ cents
- June's payment: $37.37 = 3737$ cents

Now, we need to convert this total amount from cents to dollar bills. Since 1 dollar bill is equal to 100 cents, we divide the total amount in cents by 100:

First, let's write down the given magic square:

### Step 1: Sum of the first row
The sum of the numbers in the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1

So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Sum of the second row
The sum of the numbers in the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 +  1 = 3n - 6

Since \( S = 2n + 1 \), we set up the equation:

To find the length of Jim's path, we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the building).

The width of the building is 300 feet and the length is 400 feet. Let's denote the length of Jim's path as \( d \). According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
Calculating the squares:
\[
300^2 = 90000 \quad \text{and} \quad 400^2 = 160000
\]
Adding these together:
\[
90000 + 160000 = 250000
\]
Taking the square root of 250000:
\ [
d = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}

So, Jim camina 500 feet.

Martha arrivees at the other end of the building running along the length and running back down the width. Therefore, Martha's total distance is the sum of the length and the width of the building:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Martha camina 700 feet.

To find out how many feet fewer than Martha Jim camina, we subtract Jim's distance from Martha's distance:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}

Therefore, Jim camina \(\boxed{200}\) feet fewer than Martha.```

These roots satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

And the denominator simplifies to:

"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled by visiting three of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) exactly once, we need to calculate the perimeter of each possible triangle formed by these points and then compare them.

The points and the distances between them are given as follows:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 4\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 6\)

We will consider each possible triangle and calculate its perimeter:

1. Triangle \(ABC\):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABC = AB + BC + CA = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15
   \]

2. Triangle \(ABD\):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABD = AB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]

3. Triangle \(ACD\):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ACD = AC + CD + DA = 6 + 6 + 5 = 17 
   \]

4. Triangle \(BCD\):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter of } \triangle BCD = BC + CD + DB = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13
   \]

Now, we compare the perimeters of the triangles:
- Perimeter of \(\triangle ABC = 15\)
- Perimeter of \(\triangle ABD = 13\)
- Perimeter of \(\triangle ACD = 17\)
- Perimeter of \(\triangle BCD = 13\)

The shortest perimeter is 13, which corresponds to triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled by visiting three of the points exactly once is \(\boxed{13}\).``````
