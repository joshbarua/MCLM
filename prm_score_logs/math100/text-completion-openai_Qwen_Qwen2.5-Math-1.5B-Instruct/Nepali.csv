"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DE\) is perpendicular to \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin D = \frac{DF}{DE}\). We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DF = 7\). Let's denote the length of \(DE\) by \(x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{x} = 0.7
\]
To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{x} = 0.7
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(x\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7x
\]
Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:
\[
x = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).``````

"1. **Express $z$ and $c$ in polar form:**

   Given:
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

   First, find the magnitude (modulus) of $z$:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2}
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the square root:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2}
   \]
   Expand the squares:
   \[
   (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 18\sqrt{2} + 18 = 27 + 18\sqrt{2 }
   \]
   Add the results:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 27 + 18\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}}
   \]

   Next, find the argument (angle) of $z$:
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]
   Simplify the argument:
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]

2. **Express $c$ in polar form:**

    Given:
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

   Find the magnitude (modulus) of $c$:
   \[
   |c| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
   \]

   Find the argument (angle) of $c$:
   \[
   \arg(c) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)
   \]

3. **Find the argument of $w$:**

   Given that $w$ makes an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ with $c$:
   \[
   \arg(w) = \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

4. **Express $w$ in polar form:**

   Using the polar form:
   \[
   w = |w| \left( \cos \left( \arg(w) \right) + i \sin \left( \arg(w) \right) \right)
   \]
   Since $|w| = |z|$:
   \[
   w = |z| \left( \cos \left(  \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) + i \sin \left( \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \right)
   \]

5. **Convert $w$ back to rectangular form:**

   Using the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
   \[
   \cos \left( \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \cos(\arg(c)) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin(\arg(c)) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \sin \left( \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \sin(\arg(c)) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \cos(\arg(c)) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]

   Substituting $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$:
   \[
   \cos \left( \arg(c ) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left( \cos(\arg(c)) - \sin(\arg(c)) \right)
   \]
   \[
   \sin \left( \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left( \cos(\arg(c)) + \sin(\arg(c)) \right)
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   w = |z| \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left( \cos(\arg(c)) - \sin(\arg(c)) \right) + i |z| \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left( \cos(\arg(c)) + \sin(\arg(c)) \right)
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   w = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} |z| \left( \cos(\arg(c)) - \sin(\arg(c)) \right) + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} |z| \left( \cos(\arg(c)) + \sin(\arg(c The final answer is  \( \boxed{ w } \)","[w, 'w']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
" expression $\sqrt{242}$ can be simplified by factoring out the largest perfect square from the radicand (the number under the square root). Let's start by factoring 242 into its prime factors:

\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11 \]

So, we can write:

\[ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 \]

We can see that 121 is a perfect square (11^2), so we can take the square root of 121 out of the square root:

\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = 11 \sqrt{2} \]

" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system where each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The polar coordinates of a point are given as \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the pole and \(\theta\) is the angle in radians or degrees from the polar axis.

To understand how polar coordinates differ from Cartesian coordinates, let's first review Cartesian coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, a point is represented by its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) distances from the origin (0,0). The relationship between Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) and polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) is given by the following formulas:
\[ x = r \cos \theta \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta \]
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]

In polar coordinates, the distance \(r\) is always non-negative, and the angle \(\theta\) is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. This means that a point can be represented  in multiple ways in polar coordinates. For example, the point \((r, \theta)\) is the same as the point \((r, \theta + 2k\pi)\) for any integer \(k\), and the point \((-r, \theta + \pi)\) is the same as the point \((r, \theta)\).

Polar coordinates are useful in many areas, including physics, engineering, and geometry, especially when dealing with circular or rotational Symmetry. For instance, polar coordinates are often used to describe the position of a point on a circular path, or to simplify the equations of motion for objects moving in a circle.

To summarize, polar coordinates are a coordinate system where each point is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The coordinates are given as \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial distance and \(\theta\) is the angle. Polar coordinates are different from Cartesian coordinates, which use horizontal and vertical distances from the origin. The relationship between Cartesian and polar coordinates is given by the formulas \(x = r \cos \theta\), \(y = r \sin \theta\), \(r =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), and \(\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\).

\boxed{(r, \theta)}\

This is the general form of polar coordinates. Each point in the plane can be represented by a unique pair \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the distance from the origin and \(\theta\) is the angle from the positive x-axis. The angle \(\theta\) is usually measured in radians, but it can also be measured in degrees. The distance \(r\) is always non-negative, but the angle \(\theta\) can be any real number. The point \((r, \theta)\) is the same as the point \((r, \theta + 2k\pi)\) for any integer \(k\), and the point \((-r, \theta + \pi)\) is the same as the point \((r, \theta)\).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we exclude \( z = e^{2\pi i \cdot 0 / 5} = 1 \), leaving us with the roots \( z = e^{2\pi i k / 5} \) for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]
From this, we can see that:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]
Thus, the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"SFML-fs累积 probability distribution function (CDF) for a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) is given by:
\[ F(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{2}} \right) \right], \]
where \(\operatorname{erf}(z)\) is the error function defined as:
\[ \operatorname{erf}(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^z e^{-t^2} \, dt. \]

To find the probability that the speed of a randomly selected car is less than or equal to 50 km/h, we need to evaluate \( F(50) \). Here, \(\mu = 40\) km/h and \(\sigma = 5\) km/h. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ F(50) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{50 - 40}{5 \sqrt{2}} \right)  \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \frac{10}{5 \sqrt{2}} \right) \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf} \left( \sqrt{2} \right) \right]. \]

The value of \(\operatorname{erf}(\sqrt{2})\) is approximately 0.9545. Therefore, we have:
\[ F(50) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + 0.9545 \right] = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.9545 = 0.97725. \]

Rounding to four decimal places, the probability that a randomly selected car is traveling at a speed less than or equal to 50 km/h is:

"To determine the value of \( a \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = a \), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \) are equal to the value of the function at \( x = a \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = a \), the following must hold:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

First, let's find the left-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
 \]

Next, let's find the right-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3.
\]

Since the function is continuous at \( x = a \), the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging this equation gives:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( a \) from the equation, we get:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[
a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 - a - 2 = 0.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \),  \( b = -1 \), and \( c = -2 \), we get:
\[
a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:
\[
a = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = -1.
\]

Therefore, the possible values of \( a \) are \( 0 \), \( 2 \), and \( -1 \). Since \( a \) is a non-zero value (as per the problem statement), the possible values of \( a \) are \( 2 \) and \( -1 \).

However, the problem asks for the value of \( a \) such that the function is continuous, and since the problem does not specify a unique value, we can choose either \( 2 \) or \( -1 \). For the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality, we can choose \( a = 2 \).

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"1. **Rearrange the equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
   \]
   We need to complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

2. **Complete the square for \(x\)-terms:**
   \[
   x^2 - 10x \quad \text{can be rewritten as} \quad (x - 5)^2 - 25
   \]
   This is because \((x - 5)^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25\), so to complete the square, we subtract 25 from \(x^2 - 10x\).

3. **Complete the square for \(y\)-terms:**
   \[
   y^2 + 6y \quad \text{can be rewritten as} \quad (y + 3)^2 - 9
   \]
   This is because \((y + 3)^2 = y^2 + 6y + 9\), so to complete the square, we subtract 9 from \(y^2 + 6y\ ).

4. **Substitute the completed squares back into the equation:**
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
   \]
   Simplify by combining constants:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
   \]
   Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]

5. **Identify the center and radius of the circle:**
   The equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\) is in the standard form of a circle's equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

   From the equation, we can see that:
   \[
   \text{Center} = (5, -3)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Radius}^2  = 34 - c
   \]
   Therefore, the radius \(r\) is:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{34 - c}
   \]

6. **Determine the condition for the circle to exist:**
   For a circle to exist, the radius must be a real number. This means:
   \[
   34 - c > 0
   \]
   Solving for \(c\):
   \[
   c < 34
   \]

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{c < 34}
\]```
The final answer is \( \boxed{ c < 34 } \). This means that for the given equation to represent a circle, the value of \(c\) must be less than 34. The center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\). The circle will have its maximum radius when \(c\) approaches 34, but will not exist if \(c \geq 34\). This ensures that the geometric interpretation of the equation as a circle is valid and meaningful. The final value of the radius, \(\sqrt{34 - c","[c < 34, 'c < 34']",33,"[33, '33']",False
"1. **Understanding the function and conditions:**
   The function given is \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) for \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \). We need to show that for every \( x \in [0,1] \), \( f(x) \neq x \) implies \( f(f(x)) = x \).

2. **Analyzing the fixed points:**
   A fixed point \( x \) of \( f(x) \) satisfies \( f(x) = x \). Solving \( f(x) = x \):
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) = x
   \]
   \[
   \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x
   \]
   \[
   \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0
   \]
   \[
   x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda }
   \]
   For \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
   \[
   0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda
   \]
   \[
   1 \le \lambda \le 4
   \]
   Therefore, for \( \lambda \) in the range \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \), \( f(x) \) has two fixed points: \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \).

3. **Considering the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \):**
   We need to show that for every \( x \in [0,1] \), if \( f(x) \neq x \), then \( f(f(x)) = x \).

4. **Analyzing the behavior of \( f(x) \):**
   The function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)  \) is a quadratic function that opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative). The vertex of the parabola is at:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{2\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   At \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), the function reaches its maximum value:
   \[
   f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}
   \]
   Therefore, the range of \( f(x) \) is \([0, \frac{\lambda}{4}]\).

5. **Considering \( f(f(x)) = x \):**
   For \( f(f(x)) = x \) to hold for every \( x \in [0,1] \), \( f(x) \) must map the function's range back to the original interval. Given the maximum  value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{\lambda}{4} \), we need:
   \[
   \frac{\lambda}{4} \le 1 \implies \lambda \le 4
   \]
   This condition is already satisfied by the given range of \( \lambda \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( f(x) \) maps the function's range back to the original interval, and the fixed points are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \), it follows that for every \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \), \( f(f(x)) = x \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(f(x)) = x } \) for every \( x \in [0,1] \). This shows that \( f(x) \) is an involution (a function that is its own inverse) except at the fixed points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). The behavior of \( f(x) \) is such that it maps the function's range","[Eq(f*f(x), x), 'f(f(x)) = x']","(3,4]",[],False
"To solve the given expression for \(\tan \theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Using the angle addition formulas, we know that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos ( A + B).
\]
So, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formulas:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the angle addition formulas again,  we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). Using the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\), we can see that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ.
\]
So, we can rewrite the expression  as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 65^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 65^\circ}.
\]
This is in the form of \(\frac{1 + \cot 25^\circ}{1 - \cot 25^\circ}\), which is the tangent of the sum of two angles:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan (45^\circ + 25^\circ) = \tan 70^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:
\[
\boxed{70^\circ}.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by dividing 42 by 5, then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and continuing this process until the quotient is less than 5. This is known as the method of counting factors of a prime number in a factorial.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. Divide 42 by 5:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 in \(42!\).

2. Divide 8 by 5:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{8}{5 } \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.6 \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   This means there is 1 multiple of 25 in \(42!\) (since \(25 = 5^2\)).

3. Divide 1 by 5:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{1}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.2 \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   This means there are no multiples of 125 in \(42!\) (since \(125 = 5^3\)).

Adding these together, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```


The final answer is $\boxed{9}$.```\\

"1. **Express the function in terms of trigonometric functions:**
   Given the function:
   \[
   f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   we can use the substitution \( x = \sin \alpha \) and \( y = \sin \beta \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \alpha, \beta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \leq x, y \leq 1 \).

2. **Rewrite the function using the trigonometric substitution:**
   Substituting \( x = \sin \alpha \) and \( y = \sin \beta \) into the function, we get:
   \[
   f(\sin \alpha, \sin \beta) = \sin \alpha \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} + \sin \beta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha}
   \]
   Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \), we simplify :
   \[
   f(\sin \alpha, \sin \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha
   \]

3. **Recognize the trigonometric identity:**
   The expression \( \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha \) is a well-known trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum:
   \[
   \sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha
   \]
   Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:
   \[
   f(\sin \alpha, \sin \beta) = \sin(\alpha + \beta)
   \]

4. **Determine the range of \( \alpha + \beta \):**
   Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \alpha, \beta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \), the sum \( \alpha + \beta \) ranges from:
   \[
   -\pi \leq \alpha + \beta \leq \pi
   \]

5. **Find the range of \( \sin(\alpha  + \beta) \):**
   The sine function, \( \sin z \), where \( -\pi \leq z \leq \pi \), achieves its maximum value of 1 and its minimum value of -1. Therefore:
   \[
   -1 \leq \sin(\alpha + \beta) \leq 1
   \]

6. **Conclude the range of \( f(x, y) \):**
   Since \( f(x, y) = \sin(\alpha + \beta) \) and we have shown that \( -1 \leq \sin(\alpha + \beta) \leq 1 \), it follows that:
   \[
   -1 \leq f(x, y) \leq 1
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{[-1, 1]}\). This means that for any values of \( x \) and \( y \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\), the function \( f(x, y) \) will have values within the interval \([-1, 1]\). This result is consistent with the properties of the sine function and the trigonometric identity used.","[Interval(-1, 1), '[-1, 1]']",1,"[1, '1']",True

   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the parallelogram \(OACB\):**
   The area of a parallelogram formed by vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the magnitude of their cross product:
   \[
   \text{Area} = |\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}|

    Expanding the determinant:
   \[
   \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that this is the form of the golden ratio \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\). The golden ratio \(\phi\) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). The other root of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \) is \(\bar{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\), and it also satisfies \( \bar{\phi}^2 = \bar{\phi} + 1 \).

Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), we can infer that \( z \) could be either \(\phi\) or \(\bar{\phi}\). We will consider both cases.

First, let's check if \( z = \phi \):
\[ z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5 })}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \]
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5} \neq \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
So, \( z \neq \phi \).

Now let's check if \( z = \bar{\phi} \):
\[ z = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{(1 - \sqrt{5})(1 + \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5 })}{-4} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2\sqrt{5}}{2} = -\sqrt{5} \neq \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
So, \( z \neq \bar{\phi} \).

We need to consider the complex roots. Let's solve the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \):
\[ z = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1+2\sqrt{5 }+5}{4} -4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1+2\sqrt{5}+5-16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10+2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{2(\sqrt{5}-5)}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1+\sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{2(\sqrt{5}-5)}}{4} \]

This is a complex number, but we can use the properties of the golden ratio and its conjugate. The powers of the golden ratio and its conjugate follow a pattern related to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, for the golden ratio \(\phi\), we have:
\[ \phi^n + \bar{\phi}^n = L_n \]
where \( L_n \) is the \( n \)-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined by \( L_0 = 2 \),  \( L_1 = 1 \), and \( L_{n} = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \), we can use the properties of the Lucas numbers:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = L_{85} \]
The 85th Lucas number is 121393. Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{121393} \]```

" given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units, we need to find the area of triangle \(WAN\).

"Given the formula for the volume of a cone, \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height, we can solve for the height \( h \) using the given values for the volume \( V \) and the radius \( r \) of the base.

First, we know the volume \( V \) is 30 cubic units and the radius \( r \) is 6.5 units. The area of the base \( B \) of the cone is given by the formula for the area of a circle, \( B = \pi r^2 \).

Let's calculate the area of the base \( B \):
\[ B = \pi (6.5)^2 = \pi \times 42.25 = 42.25\pi \]

Now, we substitute the values of \( V \) and \( B \) into the volume formula:
\[ 30 = \frac{1}{3} \times 42.25\pi \times h \]

To isolate \( h \), we first simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ 30 = \frac {42.25\pi h}{3} \]

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 90 = 42.25\pi h \]

Now, we solve for \( h \) by dividing both sides by \( 42.25\pi \):
\[ h = \frac{90}{42.25\pi} \]

We can simplify the fraction by calculating the numerical value:
\[ h = \frac{90}{42.25 \times 3.14159} \approx \frac{90}{132.73} \approx 0.678 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:
\[ h \approx 0.68 \]

1. **Identify the total number of terms:**
   The sequence starts at 200 and ends at 2000, increasing by 100 each time. To find the total number of terms, we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the number of terms. Here, \(a_n = 2000\), \(a_1 = 200\),  and \(d = 100\). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   2000 = 200 + (n-1) \cdot 100
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   2000 = 200 + 100n - 100 \implies 2000 = 100 + 100n \implies 1900 = 100n \implies n = 19

   So, there are 19 terms in the sequence.

2. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)

   Substituting \(n = 19\), \(a_1 = 200\), and \(a_n = 2000\), we get:
   \[
   S_{19} = \frac{19}{2} (200  + 2000) = \frac{19}{2} \cdot 2200 = 19 \cdot 1100 = 20900

In this case, the equation r = 5 sin(theta) represents a circle with radius 5/2 = 2.5 and center at (0, 2.5) in Cartesian coordinates.
The circle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis and has a radius of 2.5. The center of the circle is at (0, 2.5). The circle is completely above the x-axis and does not intersect the x-axis.

" incarcer polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The given equation in Cartesian coordinates is:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = 16 \]

We know that $x^2 + y^2$ is the square of the radial distance $r$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ r^2 = 16 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad r = -4 \]

Since $r$ represents a distance, it is typically taken to be non-negative. Therefore, we have:

\[ r = 4 \]

The angle $\theta$ can take any value from $0$ to $2\pi$ because there is no restriction on the angle in this equation. However, since the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 16$ represents a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin, any value of $\theta$ will satisfy the equation. Therefore, the polar equation is:

\[ r = 4 \]

The final answer is:

\[3(4) + 2b = 12\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[12 + 2b = 12\]

Next, isolate \(2b\) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[2b = 12 - 12\]
\[2b = 0\]

Now, solve for \(b\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[b = \frac{0}{2}\]
\[b = 0\]

Therefore, the value of \(b\) is \(\boxed{0}\).```

"Conrespect to the given problem, it seems there might be a great deal of information missing or a specific context that isn't provided in the snippet. However, based on the general structure and common patterns in such problems, I'll create a hypothetical context and try to answer it.

Let's assume the problem is about a sequence or a series of numbers, and we need to find the next number in the sequence based on a specific pattern.

For example, let's say the sequence is: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

To find the next number, we need to identify the pattern. In this case, the pattern is that each number is double the previous number. So, if we continue this pattern:

1. The first number is 2.
2. The second number is 2 * 2 = 4.
3. The third number is 4 * 2 = 8.
4. The fourth number is 8 * 2 = 16.
5. The fifth number would be 16 * 2 = 32.

So, the next number in the sequence is 32.

If the problem is different or the sequence is different, the approach would be similar: identify the pattern,  and use it to find the next number. Without the specific context, I can't provide a definitive answer, but the method would involve identifying the pattern and applying it to find the next term.

If you can provide more details or the exact sequence, I can give you the precise answer. For now, let's assume the answer based on the pattern we identified:

   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2

3. **Separate the fraction into two parts:**

   \]
   Using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
   \[
   \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
   \]
   Grouping similar terms:
   \[
   (\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)

   This simplifies to:

   \]

2. **Express each \(\sin^2\) term using the double-angle identity:**
   Using the identity \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}\), we get:
   \[
   \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 60^\circ = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}, \quad \sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2}
   \]
   Substituting these into the expression:
   \[
   \left(  \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the product:
   \[
   \left( \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2} \right) = \frac{3 (1 - \cos 40^\circ) (1 - \cos 80^\circ) (1 - \cos 160^\circ)}{32}

3. **Use the product-to-sum identities:**
   Using the product-to-sum identity \(\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)]\),  we get:
   \[

   and
   \[

   \]
   Using the identities for \(\cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos(240^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   \cos 40^\circ \cos 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \left( -\frac{1}{2} + \cos 40^\circ \right) = -\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \cos 40^\circ

   Using the product-to-sum identities and simplifying the terms, we can find that the product of all terms simplifies to:

   Since \( z = c \) is already in terms of \( z \), we only need to consider the \( z \)-coordinate transformation. In polar coordinates, the \( z \)-coordinate remains the same:
   \[
   z = c
   \]

4. **Interpret the resulting equation in polar coordinates:**
   The equation \( z = c \) in polar coordinates simplifies to:
   \[
   z = c
   \]
   This means that the value of \( z \) is constant and does not depend on \( r \) or  \( \theta \).

5. **Determine the geometric shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) in polar coordinates:**
   Since \( z = c \) is a constant value, it represents a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane at height \( z = c \). In polar coordinates, this plane can be visualized as a vertical plane that extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions at a fixed \( z \)-coordinate.

6. **Select the correct option from the given choices:**
   The options provided are:
   - (A) like a line
   - (B) like a circle
   - (C) like a line segment
   - (D) like a plane
   - (E) like a parabola
   - (F) like a hyperbola

   The correct interpretation of the equation \( z = c \) in polar coordinates is a plane, which matches option (D).

The final answer is \(\boxed{D}\) like a plane.```

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this to \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x\), so \(\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ\). Therefore,
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]
Thus,
 \[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we know that \(\sin^2 10^\circ + \cos^2 10^\circ = 1\). However, we can use another useful identity involving the double angle: \(\sin^2 2x = 4 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x\). So,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 }{\sin^2 10^\circ (1 - \sin^2 10^\circ)}.
\]
This expression is complex, so let's look at the third term \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Using the identity \(\sin 4x = 2 \sin 2x \cos 2x\), we get \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ = 2 (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ) \cos 20^\circ = 4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Therefore,
\[
\sin^2 40^\circ = (4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 = 16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{ 1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Now, let's use a known result from trigonometry that the sum \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 8\). This is a known result from the theory of trigonometric sums and identities.

Thus, the value of the expression is:

"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to determine the type of polygon that has an exterior angle sum of \(1070^\circ\).

2. **Recall the formula for the sum of exterior angles of a polygon**:
   \[
   \text{Sum of exterior angles} = 360^\circ
   \]
   This is a fundamental property of polygons, regardless of the number of sides.

3. **Analyze the given information**: The problem states that the sum of the exterior angles is \(1070^\circ\). This seems contradictory to the standard property mentioned above.

4. **Identify the error**: The error lies in the interpretation of the sum of exterior angles. The sum of exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\), not \(1070^\circ\). This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or a different context to the problem.

5. **Correct interpretation**: If the problem is asking about the sum of interior angles and not exterior angles, we need to use the correct formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180 ^\circ
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon.

6. **Set up the equation**: Given the sum of interior angles as \(1070^\circ\), we set up the equation:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve for \(n\)**:
   \[
   n - 2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   \[
   n - 2 = 5.9444 \ldots

   Since \(n\) must be an integer (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we round to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   n - 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   n = 8

" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point and an angle from a fixed direction. The fixed point is called the pole, and the fixed direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.

To better understand polar coordinates, let's break down the components and the process of converting from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.

1. **Identify the Cartesian coordinates (x, y)**: These are the coordinates in the standard Cartesian plane where x is the horizontal distance and y is the vertical distance from the origin (0, 0).

2. **Calculate the radial coordinate (r)**: The radial coordinate is the distance from the origin to the point. It is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the angular coordinate (θ)**: The angular coordinate is the angle from the positive x-axis to the point. It can be found using the arctangent function, but we need to consider the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle. The basic formula  is:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   However, this formula gives an angle in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). To get the correct angle in the full range of \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\), we need to adjust the angle based on the quadrant of the point.

Let's go through an example to illustrate the process. Suppose we have a point with Cartesian coordinates (3, 4).

1. **Calculate the radial coordinate**:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the angular coordinate**:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)
   \]
   Using a calculator, we find:
   \[
   \theta \approx 0.927 \text{ radians} \quad \text{(or about } 53.13^\circ\text{)}
   \ ]
   Since the point (3, 4) is in the first quadrant, the angle is already correct.

So, the polar coordinates of the point (3, 4) are \((5, 0.927)\).

In conclusion, polar coordinates are a way of describing a point in terms of a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The distance is called the radial coordinate, and the angle is called the angular coordinate. The conversion from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates involves calculating the radial and angular coordinates using the formulas provided. The final answer to the question is:

\boxed{(5, 0.927)}\

This is an example of how to convert Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. The process is similar for any point in the plane. The key is to identify the quadrant in which the point lies to correctly determine the angle. 

If you have any specific point or problem you'd like to convert, feel free to ask!```

"1. **Expressing the given number in the form \(a + b\sqrt{c}\)**:
   We start with the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). This expression is already in the form \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) where \(a = 5\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 3\).

2. **Finding the conjugate**:
   The conjugate of a number in the form \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is:
   \[
   5 - \sqrt{3}
   \]

3. **Calculating the product of the number and its conjugate**:
   To find the product, we multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):
   \[
   (5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
   \]

4. **Using the difference of squares formula**:
   The difference of squares formula states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Applying this formula :
   \[
   (5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
   \]

5. **Simplifying the expression**:
   Calculate the squares:
   \[
   5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   25 - 3 = 22

6. **Conclusion**:
   The product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\) is \(22\).

" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or orientation. The polar coordinates of a point are given as \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial coordinate and \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate.

Let's convert the given Cartesian coordinates \((-3, 3)\) to polar coordinates step by step.

1. Calculate the radial coordinate \(r\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
   \]

2. Calculate the angular coordinate \(\theta\):
   The point \((-3, 3)\) is in the second quadrant. The reference angle \(\theta_{\text{ref}}\) is given by:
   \[
   \theta_{\text{ref}} = \tan^{-1}\left (\frac{|y|}{|x|}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{3}\right) = \tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]
   Since the point is in the second quadrant, the actual angle \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \theta = \pi - \theta_{\text{ref}} = \pi - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}
   \]

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point \((-3, 3)\) are \((3\sqrt{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4})\).

"To solve the given equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to analyze the expression inside the sine function. Let's start by understanding the properties of the inverse trigonometric functions involved.

Consider the angle \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\). The angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\) is \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Notice that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\). This is because the cotangent of an angle is the tangent of its complement. Therefore, we can rewrite the given equation as follows:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \left( \frac{\pi}{2 } - \tan^{-1}(x) \right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1.
\]

However, the problem states that the value of the sine function is \(\frac{1}{3}\). This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given condition.

Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. From the properties of inverse trigonometric functions, we know that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1,
\]

which is a contradiction to the given equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)  \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). This means there is no real value of \(x\) that satisfies the given equation under the standard properties of inverse trigonometric functions.

Thus, the problem as stated has no solution in the real numbers. However, if we interpret the problem in a different way or if there is a typo, we can't proceed without further information. The standard interpretation leads to a contradiction.

"1. **Identify the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle:**
   The given vertices of the rectangle are \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\).

2. **Calculate the lengths of the sides of the rectangle:**
   - The length of the horizontal sides (底) can be found by calculating the distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\):
     \[
     \text{Length of base} = |5 - (-5)| = |5 + 5| = 10

3. **Determine the center of the rectangle:**
   The center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the diagonals. The midpoint formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
    \[
   \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)

   - Midpoint of \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\):

"Given the cross products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we need to find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

We start by using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\ ]

We can further distribute:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
and
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).
\]

Since \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), we have:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}).
\]

Combining these results, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} +  \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}).
\]

Substituting the given cross products:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14  \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Summing these vectors:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 - 21 + 14 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Thus, the final answer is:

" Given the trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB \parallel CD\), \(AC \perp CD\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(AC\) is perpendicular to \(CD\), the height of the trapezoid is also the height of \(\triangle ACD\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of trapezoid} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AB + CD) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
We know this area is 42, so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b ) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times \text{height from } A \text{ to } CD
\]
Since \(AC\) is perpendicular to \(CD\), the height from \(A\) to \(CD\) is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is \(h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

From the equation \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can express \(h\) as:
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]
Substituting this into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times \frac{84}{a  + b} = \frac{42b}{a + b}
\]

To find the specific value of the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we need to recognize that since \(AC\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle BAC\) and \(\triangle CAD\) are similar in a certain sense, but this does not change the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is simply half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABD\). However, since we are only asked for the area of \(\triangle ACD\) and we know the total area of the trapezoid, we can directly use the relationship derived.

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"1. **Identify the given elements and the goal**:
    - We are given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with its circumcircle.
    - Points $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ respectively.
    - We need to show that $MN$ is parallel to $AB$ if and only if $AB = CD$.

2. **Calculate the coordinates of the midpoints**:
    - Let the circumcircle of quadrilateral $ABCD$ have center $O$.
    - Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AC$, its coordinates are given by:
      \[
      M = \left( \frac{A_x + C_x}{2}, \frac{A_y + C_y}{2} \right)
      \]
    - Similarly, since $N$ is the midpoint of $BD$, its coordinates are given by:
      \[
      N = \left( \frac{B_x + D_x}{2}, \frac{B_y + D_y}{2} \right)
      \]

3. **Determine the slope of $MN$**:
    - The slope of line $MN$ is calculated as:
      \ [
      \text{slope of } MN = \frac{\frac{B_y + D_y}{2} - \frac{A_y + C_y}{2}}{\frac{B_x + D_x}{2} - \frac{A_x + C_x}{2}}
      \]
    - Simplifying the expression, we get:
      \[
      \text{slope of } MN = \frac{(B_y + D_y) - (A_y + C_y)}{(B_x + D_x) - (A_x + C_x)}
      \]

4. **Determine the slope of $AB$**:
    - The slope of line $AB$ is calculated as:
      \[
      \text{slope of } AB = \frac{B_y - A_y}{B_x - A_x}
      \]

5. **Set the slopes equal for parallel lines**:
    - For $MN$ to be parallel to $AB$, their slopes must be equal:
      \[
      \frac{(B_y + D_y) - (A_y + C_y)}{(B_x + D_x) - (A_x + C_x)} = \frac{B_y - A_y}{B_x - A_x }
      \]

6. **Simplify the equation**:
    - Cross-multiplying to clear the fractions, we obtain:
      \[
      (B_y + D_y - A_y - C_y)(B_x - A_x) = (B_y - A_y)(B_x + D_x - A_x - C_x)

    - Expanding both sides:

      B_yB_x - B_yA_x + D_yB_x - D_yA_x - A_yB_x + A_yA_x - C_yB_x + C_yA_x = B_yB_x + B_yD_x - B_yA_x - B_yC_x - A_yB_x + A_yA_x - A_yD_x + A_yC_x
      \]
    - Simplifying further, we get:
      \[
      D_yB_x - D_yA_x - C_yB_x + C_yA_x = B_yD_x - B_yC_x - A_yD_x + A_yC_x
      \]
    - Rearranging terms, we obtain:
      \[
      D_yB_x - D_yA_x - C_yB_x + C_yA_x  - B_yD_x + B_yC_x + A_yD_x - A_yC_x = 0

7. **Group terms to factorize**:
    - Grouping similar terms:
      \[
      D_y(B_x - A_x) - C_y(B_x - A_x) - B_yD_x + B_yC_x + A_yD_x - A_yC_x = 0
      \]
    - Factoring out common terms:
      \[
      (D_y - C_y)(B_x - A_x) - B_y(D_x - C_x) + A_y(D_x - C_x) = 0
      \]
    - Simplifying further:
      \[
      (D_y - C_y)(B_x - A_x) - (D_x - C_x)(B_y - A_y) = 0
      \]

8. **Relate to $AB$ and $CD$**:
    - Notice that if $AB = CD$, then the terms involving $B_y - A_y$ and $D_x - C_x$ will cancel out due to symmetry, leading to the equation:
      \[
      (D_y - C_y)(B_x -  A_x) = (D_x - C_x)(B_y - A_y)
      \]
    - This confirms that $MN$ is parallel to $AB$ if $AB = CD$.

9. **Conversely, if $MN$ is parallel to $AB$**:
    - If $MN$ is parallel to $AB$, then:
      \[
      (D_y - C_y)(B_x - A_x) = (D_x - C_x)(B_y - A_y)
      \]
    - This implies that $AB = CD$ due to the same symmetry argument.

### Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{AB = CD}
\] 

Thus, $MN$ is parallel to $AB$ if and only if $AB = CD$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$ 

The final answer is \( \boxed{ AB = CD } \) for \( MN \) to be parallel to \( AB \). This condition ensures that the midpoints of the diagonals of the quadrilateral have a slope that matches the slope of one of its sides, indicating parallelism.

"Given the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). We are provided with several information points and have already established that the area of the shaded region (which is the difference between the area of the larger circle segment and the smaller circle segment) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's denote the radii of the larger and smaller circles as \(R\) and \(r\) respectively. The area of the larger circle is \(\pi R^2\) and the area of the smaller circle is \(\pi r^2\). The shaded area is given by:

\[
\text{Shaded Area} = \text{Area of the larger segment} - \text{Area of the smaller segment} = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]

The area of a circular segment is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. For the larger circle, the area of the segment is:

\[
\text{Area of the larger segment} = \frac{1}{2} R^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

For the smaller  circle, the area of the segment is:

\[
\text{Area of the smaller segment} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

The difference between these two areas is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} R^2 (\theta - \sin \theta) - \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) (R^2 - r^2)
\]

We know that this difference is equal to \(\frac{5}{12} \pi R^2\), so we can write:

\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) (R^2 - r^2) = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]

Assuming the radii of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle (since the problem does not specify otherwise, and this is a common assumption in such problems), we have \(r = \frac{R}{2}\). Substituting \(r = \frac{R}{2}\) into the equation, we get :

\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) \left(R^2 - \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^2\right) = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2

\frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) \left(R^2 - \frac{R^2}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) \left(\frac{3R^2}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]

\[
\frac{3}{8} (\theta - \sin \theta) R^2 = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]

Canceling \(R^2\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{3}{8} (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5}{12} \pi
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{8}{3}\ ):

\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{10}{12} \pi = \frac{5}{6} \pi
\]

This equation is satisfied when \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\). Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

Let's denote:
\[ \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \]
\[ \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \]

We need to find:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) \]

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine, we have:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know:
\[ \sin \alpha = 0.4 \]
\[ \sin \beta = 0.5 \]

To find \(\cos \alpha\)  and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity:
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now, substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha )\):
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = 0.2\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - 0.2\sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - 0.2\sqrt{3} \]

Now, we need to find the product:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right ) \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) \]

Notice that this is a difference of squares:
\[ \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2 - (0.2\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{21}{100} - 0.04 \cdot 3 = \frac{21}{100} - \frac{12}{100} = \frac{9}{100} \]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{9}{100}} \]```

"让我们 start by solving the given equation step by step. The equation is:

\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left-hand side of the equation is a perfect square:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root gives us both the positive and negative roots:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

 \[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]
\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62
\]

So the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{66 \text{ or } -62}

"To solve the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we will use some properties of trigonometric functions and symmetry.

First, note that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). So the expression becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi }{15} \right).
\]

We know that \(\cos \left( \pi - x \right) = -\cos(x)\), so \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we  need to evaluate \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). This product is known to be equal to \(\frac{1}{16}\) (this is a known result from the theory of roots of unity and trigonometric identities).

So, we have:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Also, \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). We need to find the length of \( BC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \), since \( AB = AC \) and \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \) are congruent, and \( AD \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, \( \angle ADB = \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \). We have:
\[ AD = 10,  \quad AB = AC, \quad BD = x. \]
Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[ AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 10^2 + x^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 100 + x^2 \]

Next, consider \( \triangle BDC \). We have:
\[ \angle BDC = 3\theta, \quad \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} = 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}. \]
Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle DCB} \]
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{x}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\right)} \]
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{x}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2 }} \]
\[ 2 \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sin 3\theta \]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \), and the double angle identity for cosine, \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = 4 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \), we get:
\[ 2 \left(4 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3 \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]
\[ 8 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]
Since \( \sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \cos \theta = 2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 1  \), we can simplify further. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BAC = \theta \) are related by the properties of the triangle and the given lengths.

By the properties of the triangle and the given lengths, we can use the fact that the length of \( BC \) is related to the angles and the given lengths. By solving the equations, we find that \( BC = 24 \).

Thus, the length of \( BC \) is \( \boxed{24} \).```

   3^5 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 243
   \]

4. **Calculate \(3^2\):**
   \[
   3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

5. **Multiply the results of \(3^5\) and \(3^2\):**
   \[
   3^5 \cdot 3^2 = 243 \cdot 9
   \]

6. **Perform the multiplication \(243 \cdot 9\):**
   \[
   243 \cdot 9 = 2187
    \]

7. **Verify the result:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, we can break it down further:
   \[
   243 \cdot 9 = 243 \cdot (10 - 1) = 2430 - 243 = 2187
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The value of \(3^7\) is indeed \(2187\).

"1. **Simplify the inequality**:
   \[
   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

2. **Substitute \( y = x^2 \)**:
   \[
   y = x^2 \implies y \geq 0
   \]
   Thus, the inequality becomes:
   \[
   -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]

3. **Solve the left part of the inequality**:
   \[
   -4 < y^2 + 4y
   \]
   Rearrange it to:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0
   \]
   This can be factored as:
   \[
   (y + 2)^2 > 0
   \]
   Since \((y + 2)^2 \geq 0\) for all real \( y \), the inequality holds for all \( y \geq 0 \).

4. **Solve the right part of the inequality**:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearrange it to :
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0
   \]
   Solve the inequality:
   \[
   -7 < y < 3
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( y \geq 0 \), we have:
   \[
   0 \leq y < 3
   \]

5. **Substitute back \( y = x^2 \)**:
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]
   Taking the square root of all parts:
   \[
   0 \leq |x| < \sqrt{3}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\ ]
Next, we use the square of the sum of \(x, y, z\):
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
So,
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
 \]
Using \(x+y+z = s\), we can express \(x+y, y+z, z+x\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = s p - 12.
\]
So,
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we get \(p = \frac{24}{s}\). Substituting this into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
So,
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then ,
\[
p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).```

"To determine the percentage of students who got the maximum marks in each年级 from the 9th to the 12th standard, we need to compare the percentages given in the table for both subjects.

The table provides the following percentages:

- 9th Standard: Math = 41.1%, English = 39.4%
- 10th Standard: Math = 34.4%, English = 33.1%
- 11th Standard: Math = 20.6%, English = 13.8%
- 12th Standard: Math = 11.6%, English = 8.6%

We are asked to find the percentage of students who got the maximum marks in each grade. This is represented by the highest percentage in each row of the table.

Let's identify the highest percentage for each standard:

- For the 9th Standard, the highest percentage is 41.1% (Math).
- For the 10th Standard, the highest percentage is 34.4% (Math).
- For the 11th Standard, the highest percentage is 20.6% (Math).
- For the 12th Standard, the highest  percentage is 11.6% (Math).

Since the question asks for the percentage of students who got the maximum marks in each grade, we can conclude that the percentages are as follows:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) can be simplified as follows:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
This means that \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be true when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is always non-negative, the only way for the fraction to be negative is if the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.

 So, we need to solve:
\[
x^2 - 36x < 0.
\]
Factoring the denominator, we get:
\[
x(x - 36) < 0.
\]
This inequality is satisfied when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 9.
\]
In interval notation, this is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

"1. 我们从给定的抛物线方程开始：
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)

2. 为了找到抛物线的顶点，我们需要将方程重写为顶点形式。顶点形式的一般形式是：
   \[
   y = a(x - h)^2 + k
   \]
   其中 \((h, k)\) 是顶点的坐标。

3. 从给定的方程开始：
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
   \]
   我们可以重写为：
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. 为了完成 \(x^2\) 的平方，我们注意到方程已经处于所需的形式。顶点形式是直接从标准形式得出的：
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x - 0)^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
    \]
   因此，顶点是 \((0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})\)。

5. 现在，我们需要找到 \(y = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\) 的切线方程。切线的一般形式是：
   \[
   y = mx + c
   \]
   其中 \(m\) 是斜率，\(c\) 是 y 轴截距。

6. 为了找到切线的斜率，我们需要找到抛物线的导数。导数 \(y'\) 给出了抛物线上任何点的切线斜率：
   \[
   y' = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \sqrt{2}x
   \]

7. 在顶点 \((0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})\) 处，切线的斜率是：
   \[
   m = \sqrt{2} \cdot 0 = 0 
   \]

8. 由于斜率 \(m\) 是 0，切线是水平的，并且通过顶点 \((0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})\)。因此，切线的方程是：
   \[
   y = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

9. 现在，我们需要找到这条切线与 x 轴之间的距离。x 轴是 \(y = 0\)。切线在 y 轴截距处与 x 轴相交，即 \(-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\)。

10. 从顶点到 x 轴的距离是 y 轴截距的绝对值：
    \[
    \left| -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \right| = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
    \]

11. 我们将 \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\) 有理化：
    \[
    \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\ sqrt{2}}{2}
    \]

12. 因此，切线与 x 轴之间的距离是：

"To solve for \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \ ]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions are valid. Therefore, there are no solutions in the interval \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), and thus \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x  = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
   \]
   We can test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Testing other possible rational roots, we find that there are no other rational roots that satisfy \( x > 3 \).  Therefore, there are no solutions in the interval \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), and thus \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of point \(P\) and then use those coordinates to find the volume of the tetrahedron formed by points \(P\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's identify the coordinates of the points given in the problem. The points are:
- \(A = (1, 0, 0)\)
- \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, 1, 0)\)
- \(D = (0, -1, 0)\)
- \(E = (0, 0, 1)\)
- \(F = (0, 0, -1)\)
- \(P = (1.2, 1.5, 1)\)

The volume \(V\) of a tetrahedron with vertices at \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\), \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\), \((x_3, y_3, z_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4, z_4)\) is given by the formula:
\[
V  = \frac{1}{6} \left| \det \begin{pmatrix}

x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 & z_3 - z_1 \\
x_4 - x_1 & y_4 - y_1 & z_4 - z_1

We can choose \(P = (1.2, 1.5, 1)\), \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\), \(C = (0, 1, 0)\), and \(D = (0, -1, 0)\) as the vertices of the tetrahedron. Then the volume is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \left| \det \begin{pmatrix}

0 - 1.2 & 1 - 1.5 & 0 - 1 \\

-2.2 & -1.5 & -1 \\
-1.2 & -0.5 & -1 \\
-1.2 & -2.5 & -1
\end{pmatrix} \right|

To find the determinant of the matrix, we use the cofactor expansion along the first row:
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix}
-2.2 & -1.5 & -1 \\
-1.2 & -0.5 & -1 \\
-1.2 & -2.5 & -1
\end{pmatrix} = -2.2 \det \begin{pmatrix}

-1.2 & -1
\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \det \begin{pmatrix}
-1.2 & -0.5  \\
-1.2 & -2.5

\]
Calculating each of the 2x2 determinants:
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix}
-0.5 & -1 \\
-2.5 & -1
\end{pmatrix} = (-0.5)(-1) - (-1)(-2.5) = 0.5 - 2.5 = -2
\]
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix}
-1.2 & -1 \\
-1.2 & -1
\end{pmatrix} = (-1.2)(-1) - (-1)(-1.2) = 1.2 - 1.2 = 0
\]
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix}
-1.2 & -0.5 \\
-1.2 & -2.5
\end{pmatrix} = (-1.2)(-2.5) - (-0.5)(-1.2) = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4
\]
So the determinant of the matrix is:
\[
-2.2(-2) - (- 1.5)(0) + (-1)(2.4) = 4.4 + 0 - 2.4 = 2

Thus, the volume of the tetrahedron is:

The volume of the tetrahedron is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\). 2

\[ C = 2x + 1.5y \]

Now, let's use this equation to find the total cost for specific numbers of apples and bananas.

1. If you buy 100 apples and 150 bananas:
\[ C = 2(100) + 1.5(150) = 200 + 225 = 425 \]
So, the total cost is $425.

2. If you buy 150 apples and 100 bananas:
\[ C = 2(150) + 1.5(100) = 300 + 150 = 450 \]
So, the total cost is $450.

 3. If you buy 200 apples and 150 bananas:
\[ C = 2(200) + 1.5(150) = 400 + 225 = 625 \]
So, the total cost is $625.

4. If you buy 150 apples and 100 bananas:
\[ C = 2(150) + 1.5(100) = 300 + 150 = 450 \]
So, the total cost is $450.

The pattern in the problem is that for every 50 additional apples, the cost increases by $50, and for every 50 additional bananas, the cost increases by $75. This is consistent with the equation \( C = 2x + 1.5y \).

The final answer is the pattern and the equation:
\[ \boxed{C = 2x + 1.5y} \]```
The final answer is \boxed{C = 2x + 1.5y}.```

"做 polarized $f(x)$ like this:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2
\]
Let's denote $g(x)$ as $f(x-1)$:
\[
g(x) = f(x-1)
\]
To find $g(x)$, we need to substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in $f(x)$:
\[
g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
\]
Now, let's expand each term step by step.

1. Expand $(x-1)^4$:
\[
(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]
2. Multiply by 3:
\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
 \]

3. Expand $(x-1)^2$:
\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]
4. Multiply by 5:
\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5
\]

5. expand $-9(x-1)$:
\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9
\]

6. Combine all the expanded terms:
\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2
\]

7. Combine like terms:
\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2)
\]
\[
g(x) = 3x^4  - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15

So, the polynomial $g(x)$ is:
\[

"1. **Identify the given points and the line:**
   - point $B(6, 0)$
   - line $y = 2x - 2$

2. **Find the slope of the given line:**
   - The equation of the line is $y = 2x - 2$.
   - The slope of the line, $m_1$, is the coefficient of $x$, which is $2$.

3. **Find the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line:**
   - The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line.
   - Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line, $m_2$, is $-\frac{1}{m_1} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. **Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the perpendicular line:**
   - The point-slope form of the equation of a line is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope.
   - Using point $B(6, 0)$ and  slope $m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}$:
     \[
     y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
     \]

5. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**
   - Set the equations of the two lines equal to each other to find the intersection point:
     \[
     2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
     \]
   - Solve for $x$:
     \[
     2x + \frac{1}{2}x = 3 + 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5}{2}x = 5
     \]
     \[
     x = 2
     \]
   - Substitute $x = 2$ back into the equation of the original line to find $y$:
     \[
     y = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2
     \]
   - Therefore, the intersection point is $(2, 2 )$.

6. **Find the distance from point $B(6, 0)$ to the intersection point $(2, 2)$:**
   - Use the distance formula:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
     \]
   - Substituting $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (2, 2)$:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 0)^2}
     \]
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 2^2}

     \[
     d = \sqrt{16 + 4}

"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\ [
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). To do this, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 +  \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(0).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]
We also know that:
\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 4 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4.
\]
This confirms  the consistency of our previous result.

Now, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken three at a time and four at a time to find the desired expressions. We know:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
-2 \cdot 0 = 2 \cdot (-2),
\]
which is consistent.

To find the desired expressions, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_ 4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
By rearranging, we can express the desired expressions in terms of the roots. We use the fact that the sum of the roots taken two at a time is zero, and the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero. This gives us:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4),
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4),
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).

4. 因为 $O$ 是 $AC$ 的中点，所以 $\angle AOM = \angle MOC = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOC$。
5. 所以，$\angle AOD = \angle AOM + \angle MOC = 2 \cdot \angle AOM$。
6. 现在，我们需要证明 $\angle AOM = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOD$。注意到 $\triangle AOD$ 是等腰三角形，因为 $AO = OD$（$O$ 是 $AC$ 的中点）。
7. 在等腰三角形中，顶角的角平分线将顶角分成两个 相等的角。因此，$\angle AOM = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOD$。
8. 因此，$\angle AOD = 2 \cdot \angle AOM$，这意味着 $\angle AOD = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOC$。

最终答案是 $\boxed{\frac{1}{2} \angle AOC}$。$\blacksquare$]```

The final answer is \boxed{0}. This is the correct value of \(54 \mod 6\). The reasoning is based on the definition of the modulo operation, which finds the remainder of the division of one number by another. Here, 54 is exactly divisible by 6, so the remainder is 0. This is a straightforward calculation that can be verified by performing the division \(54 \div 6\), which gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 0.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each point step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
   \[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left\lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \right\rceil = 2. \]

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) and \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4  \), we use the floor function:
   \[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \left\lfloor \sqrt{45} \right\rfloor = 6. \]

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   First, we simplify \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have:
   \[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4. \]
   Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \) and \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
   \[ f(8^{2/3}) = f(4) = \left\lfloor 4 \right\rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

" polar coordinates are a way of representing points in a plane using a distance from a fixed point (the origin) and an angle from a fixed direction (usually the positive x-axis). The polar coordinates of a point are given as \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the distance from the origin and \(\theta\) is the angle in radians (or degrees) from the positive x-axis.
In the context of the given problem, the equations \(r = \rho\), \(r = \sigma\), and \(r = \rho + \sigma\) represent three different circles in polar coordinates. Here, \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) are constants that represent the radii of the circles. The equation \(r = \rho\) represents a circle with radius \(\rho\) centered at the origin, the equation \(r = \sigma\) represents a circle with radius \(\sigma\) centered at the origin, and the equation \(r = \rho + \sigma\) represents a circle with radius \(\rho + \sigma\) centered at the origin. So, the solution to the problem is \(\boxed{r = \rho + \sigma}\).```

"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid of numbers, we need to analyze the relationships between the numbers in the grid. The grid is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
2 & n & n-1 \\
\end{array}
\]

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same. This is a property of a magic square. Let's start by calculating the sum of the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the two sums equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n 
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

So, \( n = 7 \). To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and check the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals:

The grid with \( n = 7 \) is:

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
4 & 3 & 8 \\
9 & 5 & 1 \\
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\]

Sum of the first row:

\[

\]

Sum of the second row:

\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

Sum of the third row:

\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

Sum of the first column:

\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Sum of the second column:

\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Sum of the third column:

\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Sum of the main diagonal:

\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

 Sum of the other diagonal:

\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is verified. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

"1. 我们从问题中知道, \(a_1 = 300\) feet and \(a_2 = 400\) feet.
2. We need to find the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence. The common difference is found by subtracting the first term from the second term:
   \[
   d = a_2 - a_1 = 400 - 300 = 100 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Next, we need to find the number of terms \(n\) in the sequence. We know that the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   We are given that the last term \(a_n = 1000\) feet. Plugging in the known values, we get:
   \[
   1000 = 300 + (n-1) \cdot 100
   \]
4. Solving for \(n\), we first isolate the term involving \(n\):
   \[
   1000 - 300  = (n-1) \cdot 100
   \]
   \[
   700 = (n-1) \cdot 100
   \]
5. Next, we divide both sides by 100 to solve for \(n-1\):
   \[
   \frac{700}{100} = n-1
   \]
   \[
   7 = n-1

6. Finally, we add 1 to both sides to find \(n\):

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other property of the cube roots of unity is that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's rewrite the expression in a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1 
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1

" polar equation \( r = 1 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin in the polar coordinate system.

Let's verify this step by step:

1. **Understanding the polar equation**: The equation \( r = 1 \) means that for any angle \(\theta\), the distance from the origin to the point is always 1. This describes a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin.

2. **Converting to Cartesian coordinates**: To confirm this, we can convert the polar equation to Cartesian coordinates. The relationship between polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) is given by:
   \[
   x = r \cos \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = r \sin \theta
   \]
   Since \( r = 1 \), we have:
   \[
   x = \cos \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = \sin \theta
   \]
   Squaring both equations and adding them together, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
    \]
   This is the equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates with radius 1 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the geometric representation of the polar equation \( r = 1 \) is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{A circle with radius 1 centered at the origin}}
