"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In \( \triangle DEF \), \( \angle D \) is opposite side \( EF \) and hypotenuse is \( DF \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
We are given that \( EF = 7 \). Let \( DF = x \). Then:
\[
\frac{7}{x} = 0.7
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
So, \( DF = 10 \).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
\]
 Substituting the known values:
\[
DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
DE^2 + 49 = 100
\]
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \( \boxed{\sqrt{51}} \).```

"1. **Identify the given complex numbers and their properties:**
   - $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$
   - $c = 2 - 3i$
   - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$

2. **Calculate the modulus of $z$:**
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{(4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2) + (9 + 18\sqrt{2} + 18)}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 27 + 18\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}}
   \]

3. **Determine the argument of $z$:**
    - The real part of $z$ is $2 + \sqrt{2}$.
   - The imaginary part of $z$ is $-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})$.
   - The argument $\arg(z)$ is given by:
     \[
     \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the arctangent:
     \[
     \frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2})}{(2 + \sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2})}

     \[
     = \frac{-(6 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{2} - 6)}{4 - 2} = \frac{-( 6 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{2} - 6)}{2} = \frac{-(3\sqrt{2})}{2}
     \]
     \[
     = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the argument of $w$:**
   - The argument of $w$ is the argument of $z$ plus $\theta$:
     \[
     \arg(w) = \arg(z) + \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}
     \]

5. **Express $w$ in polar form:**
   - $w = |w|(\cos(\arg(w)) + i\sin(\arg(w)))$
   - Since $|w| = |z|$, we have:
     \[
     w = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}}\left(\cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\ tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)
     \]

6. **Convert $w$ back to rectangular form:**
   - Use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine:
     \[
     \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)

     \[
     \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\cos\left(\frac{\pi }{4}\right) + \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
     \]

7. **Simplify the expressions:**
   - Using the values $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$:
     \[
     \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

" Polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The polar coordinates of a point are given by \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the pole and \(\theta\) is the angle in radians or degrees from the polar axis.

To convert from Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we use the following formulas:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]
The angle \(\theta\) is usually adjusted to be within the range \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\) (or \(0^\circ \leq \theta < 360^\circ\)).

To convert from polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) to Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\), we use the following formulas:
\[ x = r \cos \theta \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta \]

Let's apply these formulas to the given problem . The problem states that the distance from the pole is 3, and the angle is 0 degrees. So, we can write the polar coordinates as \((3, 0^\circ)\).

To convert these polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, we use the formulas:
\[ x = 3 \cos 0^\circ = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
\[ y = 3 \sin 0^\circ = 3 \cdot 0 = 0 \]

Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates are \((3, 0)\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(3, 0)}
\]```
The answer is \(\boxed{(3, 0)}\). This is because the point is 3 units away from the origin and at an angle of 0 degrees, which places it at the coordinates \((3, 0)\) in Cartesian coordinates. This is the final answer.```

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to show that \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divisible by 7.

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}

\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Thus, the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) becomes:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Now, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

This shows that \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is not divisible by 7. The problem statement seems to have a mistake. The correct interpretation should be that the product is not divisible by 7, not that it is divisible by 7.

"Given the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find a point \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\) and determine the minimum possible value of \(x + y\).

First, let's consider the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\). The slope of this line is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
\]
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[
y - 3 = 5(x - 5) \implies y = 5x - 22
\]
Next, let's consider the line passing through the points \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\). The slope of this line is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = -4
\]
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[
y - 8 = -4(x - 6) \implies  y = -4x + 32
\]
Finally, let's consider the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\). The slope of this line is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 3}{7 - 5} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[
y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 5) \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
\]
Now, we need to find the minimum value of \(x + y\) for a point \((x, y)\) that lies above all three lines and satisfies \(x > 7\). We will check the point where the lines intersect for \(x > 7\).

The intersection of the lines \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = -4x + 32\) can be found by setting the equations equal to each other:
\[
5x - 22 = -4x + 32 \implies 9x = 54 \ implies x = 6
\]
Since \(x = 6\) is not greater than 7, we do not consider this intersection point.

The intersection of the lines \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\) can be found by setting the equations equal to each other:
\[
5x - 22 = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \implies 10x - 44 = x + 1 \implies 9x = 45 \implies x = 5
\]
Since \(x = 5\) is not greater than 7, we do not consider this intersection point.

The intersection of the lines \(y = -4x + 32\) and \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\) can be found by setting the equations equal to each other:
\[
-4x + 32 = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \implies -8x + 64 = x + 1 \implies  -9x = -63 \implies x = 7
\]
Since \(x = 7\) is not greater than 7, we do not consider this intersection point.

Instead, we consider the point on the line \(y = -4x + 32\) for \(x > 7\). The smallest integer value for \(x\) greater than 7 is 8. Substituting \(x = 8\) into the equation \(y = -4x + 32\):
\[
y = -4(8) + 32 = 0
\]
Thus, the point \((8, 0)\) is on the line \(y = -4x + 32\) and satisfies \(x > 7\). The value of \(x + y\) at this point is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 0 = 8

Therefore, the minimum possible value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{8}\).```

"1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**

   The function given is \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \). To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.

   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]

   We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \).

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-14)}}{2 \cdot 1}

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2 }
   \]

   This gives us two solutions:

   \[
   x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2
   \]

   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**

   To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \). The degrees of the numerator and the denominator are both 1 and 2, respectively. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"Given that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z^5 = 1 \). The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). This means that for \( z \neq 1 \), we have:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \ ). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1. \]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x  = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x
\]
So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}

The final answer is \(\boxed{\cot x}\). This step-by-step solution shows how to simplify the given trigonometric expression by using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation. The final answer is \(\cot x\), which is the cotangent of \(x\). This problem is a good example of how trigonometric identities can be used to simplify expressions, and it is a common type of problem in trigonometry and calculus.

" polar coordinates 1 2 ( polar coordinate system ) is a two-dimensional coordinate system where each point is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The polar coordinates of a point are given as (r, Î¸), where r is the distance from the pole and Î¸ is the angle from the polar axis. The polar axis is usually taken to be the positive x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.

The relationship between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, Î¸) is given by the following formulas:

x = r cos(Î¸)
y = r sin(Î¸)

To convert from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the following formulas:

r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
Î¸ = arctan(y/x)

To convert from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, we use the following formulas:

x = r cos(Î¸)
y = r sin(Î¸)

In the given problem, we are not provided with any specific Cartesian coordinates to convert to polar coordinates. However, if we assume that we are given a point in Cartesian coordinates, we can use the above formulas to find its polar coordinates. For example, if we are given the point  (3, 4) in Cartesian coordinates, we can convert it to polar coordinates as follows:

r = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5
Î¸ = arctan(4/3)

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point (3, 4) are (5, arctan(4/3)).

In the given problem, the answer is already provided as (5, arctan(4/3)). This means that the point in Cartesian coordinates (3, 4) has polar coordinates (5, arctan(4/3)). Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{(5, \arctan(4/3))}.

This is the final answer. The problem does not provide any specific Cartesian coordinates to convert, so the answer is based on the assumption that the point (3, 4) is given in Cartesian coordinates. The answer is in the form of polar coordinates, as required by the problem. The final answer is \boxed{(5, \arctan(4/3))}.```

"Given the polynomials \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that their product equals \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). Finally, we need to find \( a + b \).

First, let's write down the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will expand this product term by term:

1. Multiply \( 3t^2 \) by each term in the second polynomial:
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \( 5t \) by each term in the second polynomial:
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20 t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \( a \) by each term in the second polynomial:
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal the given polynomial \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). Therefore,  we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \( t^4 \) term:
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. \( t^3 \) term:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. \( t^2 \) term:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. \( t \) term:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step. First, solve for \( a \) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \( a = -3 \) into the \( t^2 \) term equation:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8
\]
\[
-6 + 5b - 12 = -8
\]
\[
5b - 18 = -8
\]
\[
5b = 10
\]
\[
b = 2
 \]

Now, verify \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \) with the \( t^3 \) and \( t \) term equations:
For the \( t^3 \) term:
\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]

For the \( t \) term:
\[
-10 + ab = -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied. Therefore, the values are correct. Finally, find \( a + b \):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \( a + b \) is:

"ures are in the ratio of \(7:24:25\). Let's denote these sides as \(7k\), \(24k\), and \(25k\), where \(k\) is a positive constant.

The perimeter of the triangle is given as \(20\pi\). Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:
\[7k + 24k + 25k = 20\pi\]
\[56k = 20\pi\]
\[k = \frac{20\pi}{56} = \frac{5\pi}{14}\]

Now, we can find the lengths of the sides of the triangle by substituting \(k\) back into the expressions for the sides:
\[7k = 7 \cdot \frac{5\pi}{14} = \frac{35\pi}{14} = \frac{5\pi}{2}\]
\[24k = 24 \cdot \frac{5\pi}{14} = \frac{120\pi}{14} = \frac{60\pi}{7}\]
\[25k = 25  \cdot \frac{5\pi}{14} = \frac{125\pi}{14}\]

The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Here, the base and height are the two legs of the right triangle, which are \(7k\) and \(24k\). Therefore, the area \(A\) is:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 7k \times 24k = \frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times 24 \times k^2 = 84k^2\]
Substituting \(k = \frac{5\pi}{14}\), we get:
\[k^2 = \left(\frac{5\pi}{14}\right)^2 = \frac{25\pi^2}{196}\]
So the area is:
\[A = 84 \times \frac{25\pi^2}{196} = \frac{84 \times 25\pi^2}{196} = \frac{21 00\pi^2}{196} = \frac{525\pi^2}{49} = \frac{75\pi^2}{7}\]

Thus, the area of the triangle is \(\frac{75\pi^2}{7}\).

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal, and that this value is also equal to \(f(a)\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
1. The left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal \(f(a)\).
2. The right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal \(f(a)\).

First, let's find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a.  \]

Next, let's find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3. \]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

However, we need to check if these values make sense in the context of the function. Since \(a\) is a constant that defines the function's behavior, we can choose any of these values, but typically, we look for a positive value that makes the function meaningful. Here, \(a = 2\) is the most straightforward and positive solution.

 Therefore, the value of \(a\) that makes the function \(f(x)\) continuous is:
\[ \boxed{2}. \] 

This value of \(a\) ensures that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\). The graph of the function \(y = f(x)\) would be a parabola for \(x \geq a\) and a straight line for \(x < a\), meeting at the point \((a, f(a))\) in a continuous manner. This confirms that the function is continuous at \(x = a\) when \(a = 2\). The correct value of \(a\) is indeed \(2\). 

Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\). The function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) when \(a = 2\). The graph of the function \(y = f(x)\) would be a parabola for \(x \geq a\) and a straight line for \(x < a\), meeting at the point \((a, f(a))\) in a continuous manner.

"Given the equation \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\), we need to find the value of \(c\) such that the equation represents a circle with a radius of 1.

First, we complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[x^2 - 10x\]
We complete the square by adding and subtracting \((\frac{10}{2})^2 = 25\):
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25\]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[y^2 + 6y\]
We complete the square by adding and subtracting \((\frac{6}{2})^2 = 9\):
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9\]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Simplifying, we have:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]
Rearranging gives:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\]

This is the standard form of the equation of a circle \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius. Here, the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \(r\) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius of the circle is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[34 - c = 1\]

   \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0
   \]
   \[
   x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \ text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0
   \]
   Solving the second equation for \( x \):
   \[
   \lambda - \lambda x = 1
   \]
   \[
   \lambda(1 - x) = 1
   \]
   \[
   1 - x = \frac{1}{\lambda}
   \]
   \[
   x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}
   \]

3. **Check the range of \( x \):**
   For \( x \) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
   \[
   0 \le 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \le 1
   \]
   Solving the inequalities:
   \[
   0 \le 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} \le 1
   \]
   \[
   \lambda \ge 1
   \]
   And:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \le 1
   \]
    \[
   -\frac{1}{\lambda} \le 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} \ge 0
   \]
   This is always true for \( \lambda > 0 \).

   Therefore, \( x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \) is in \([0,1]\) if and only if \( \lambda \ge 1 \).

4. **Verify \( f(f(x)) = x \) for \( f(x) = x \):**
   We need to show that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \) for some \( x \in [0,1] \):
   \[
   f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x))
   \]
   \[
   f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x))
   \]
   Simplifying \( f(f(x)) \):
   \[
   f(f(x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 )
   \]

5. **Set \( f(f(x)) = x \):**
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):
   \[
   \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1
   \]
   This is a cubic equation in \( x \). To find \( x \) such that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \), we need to solve this equation for \( x \) in \([0,1]\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   For \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \), there exists an \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \). This is true for \( 1 \le \lambda \le 4 \).

"We start with the given expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We will simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B )\) and \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)\). We can rewrite the numerator as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20 ^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can use the angle addition formulas again. We can rewrite the denominator as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

 Using the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin (90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities for sine and cosine:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ,
\]

\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right ) \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = \frac{\cos 30^\circ}{-\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan \theta\) is \(\boxed{-\sqrt{3}}\). This corresponds to the angle \(\theta = -60^\circ + 180^\circ k\) for some integer \(k\). However, since the problem does not specify a particular range for \(\theta\), the principal value is \(\theta = -60^\circ\), but the general solution is \(\theta = -60^\circ + 180^\circ k\).","[-sqrt(3), '-\\sqrt{3}']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",False
"Solve the following riddle:

 polar coordinates (x, y) are related to rectangular coordinates (r, Î¸) by the formulas:
   \[
   x = r \cos \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = r \sin \theta
   \]
   Suppose a point is given in rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\), and we need to find its distance from the origin. The distance \(d\) is given by:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   How would you express this distance formula using polar coordinates?

1. **Identify the given formulas:**
   - The relationship between polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) and rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) is given by:
     \[
     x = r \cos \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = r \sin \theta
     \]

2. **Substitute \(x\) and \(y\) in the distance formula:**
   - The distance \(d\) from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
     \]

 3. **Replace \(x\) and \(y\) using the polar coordinate formulas:**
   - Substitute \(x = r \cos \theta\) and \(y = r \sin \theta\) into the distance formula:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(r \cos \theta)^2 + (r \sin \theta)^2}
     \]

4. **Simplify the expression inside the square root:**
   - Calculate the squares:
     \[
     (r \cos \theta)^2 = r^2 \cos^2 \theta \quad \text{and} \quad (r \sin \theta)^2 = r^2 \sin^2 \theta
     \]
   - Add the two terms:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{r^2 \cos^2 \theta + r^2 \sin^2 \theta}
     \]

5. **Factor out \(r^2\) from the expression inside the square root:**
   - Use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
     \[
     d = \sqrt{r^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta )}
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{r^2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{r^2}
     \]

6. **Simplify the square root:**
   - Since \(r\) represents the distance from the origin, it is non-negative. Therefore:
     \[
     d = r
     \]

### Conclusion:
The distance from the origin to a point given in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) is simply \(r\).

\boxed{r}

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the following method to count the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):

1. Divide 42 by 5 and take the integer part of the quotient.
2. Divide the result by 5 again and take the integer part of the quotient.
3. Repeat this process until the quotient is less than 5.

Let's perform these steps:

1. \(42 \div 5 = 8\) with a remainder of 2. So, there are 8 factors of 5.
2. \(8 \div 5 = 1\) with a remainder of 3. So, there is 1 more factor of 5.
3. \(1 \div 5 = 0\) with a remainder of 1. So, there are no more factors of 5.

 Adding these together, we get \(8 + 1 = 9\). Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"1. **Define the function and its domain:**
   Given the function:
   \[
   f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   where the domain is $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ and $-1 \leq y \leq 1$.

2. **Analyze the function at the boundaries:**
   - When $x = -1$, we have:
     \[
     f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
     \]
   - When $x = 1$, we have:
     \[
     f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
     \]
    - When $y = -1$, we have:
     \[
     f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \cdot 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
     \]
   - When $y = 1$, we have:
     \[
     f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \cdot 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
     \]

3. **Determine the maximum value:**
   - From the boundary analysis, we see that the function values at these boundaries are either $\sqrt{1 - y^2}$ or $-\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.
   - The maximum value of $\sqrt{1 - y^2}$ is when $y = 0$, giving:
     \[
     \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1
     \]
   -  Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x, y)$ is 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum value of the function $f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ within the given domain is 1.

The final answer is $\boxed{1}$```

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, we can express \( z \) in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is some angle. The given equation then becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and  \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta) \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine \( \theta \). The value \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) corresponds to a specific angle, but we don't need to find \( \theta \) explicitly. Instead, we use the fact that \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this quadratic equation are:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5 }}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5 - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \]

However, we can use the properties of the roots of unity and the periodicity of the cosine function. Since \( z \) is a root of a quadratic equation, \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex conjugates, and their powers will exhibit periodic behavior. Specifically, since \( z^2  = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z - 1 \), we can reduce the exponent modulo 2 because the powers of \( z \) will cycle every 2 steps in terms of their real part due to the symmetry and periodicity of the cosine function.

We need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Since \( 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) (because \( 85 = 4 \cdot 21 + 1 \)), we have:

\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

"100 à¤ |-150 equations like ""x + y = 100"" and ""x - y = 150"", we can solve for the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Let's start by writing down the given equations:
1. \(x + y = 100\)
2. \(x - y = 150\)

We can solve these equations using the method of elimination. First, we add the two equations together to eliminate \(y\):

\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 100 + 150
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

\[
x + y + x - y = 2x
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
2x = 250
\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{250}{2} = 125
\]

Now that we have \(x = 125\), we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for \(y\). Let's use the first equation \(x + y  = 100\):

\[
125 + y = 100
\]

Solving for \(y\), we subtract 125 from both sides:

\[
y = 100 - 125 = -25
\]

So, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) are \(x = 125\) and \(y = -25\). Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

\[
\boxed{x = 125, y = -25}

To determine the value of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is the \( n \)-th power of another number, we need to express \( 2^{24} \) in the form \( a^n \) where \( a \) and \( n \) are integers and \( n > 1 \).

We start by factoring \( 2^{24} \) into a product of smaller powers of 2. One way to do this is to express \( 2^{24} \) as \( (2^k)^m \) where \( k \) and \( m \) are integers and \( km = 24 \) and \( m > 1 \). This means \( n = m \).

Let's find some possible values for \( k \) and \( m \):

1. If \( k = 2 \), then \( m = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} = 4^{12} \). Here, \( n = 12 \).
2. If \( k = 3  \), then \( m = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 = 8^8 \). Here, \( n = 8 \).
3. If \( k = 4 \), then \( m = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 = 16^6 \). Here, \( n = 6 \).
4. If \( k = 6 \), then \( m = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 = 64^4 \). Here, \( n = 4 \).
5. If \( k = 8 \), then \( m = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 = 256^3 \). Here, \( n = 3 \).
6. If \( k = 12 \), then \( m = \frac{24}{12}  = 2 \). So, \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 = 4096^2 \). Here, \( n = 2 \).

Among these, the smallest value of \( n \) greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, the value of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is the \( n \)-th power of another number is \( \boxed{2} \).```

"1. **Understand the problem context**: 
   - The problem states that the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock is \(75^\circ\).
   - We need to determine the number of times in one day (24 hours) that this specific angle occurs.

2. **Analyze the clock's movement**:
   - A clock is a circle, which is \(360^\circ\) in total.
   - The angle between the hour and minute hands can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \theta = \left| 30H - 5.5M \right|
     \]
     where \(H\) is the hour and \(M\) is the minute.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   - Given that \(\theta = 75^\circ\), we have:
     \[
     \left| 30H - 5.5M \right| = 75
     \]

4. **Solve for \(M\)**:
   - This equation leads to two possible cases:
     \[
     30H - 5.5M = 75 \quad \text{or} \quad 30H  - 5.5M = -75
     \]
   - Solving these equations for \(M\):
     \[
     M = \frac{30H - 75}{5.5} \quad \text{or} \quad M = \frac{30H + 75}{5.5}
     \]

5. **Calculate valid times**:
   - For each hour \(H\) from 0 to 23, calculate \(M\) and check if it is within the valid range \(0 \leq M < 60\).
   - For example, when \(H = 3\):
     \[
     M = \frac{30 \times 3 - 75}{5.5} = \frac{90 - 75}{5.5} = \frac{15}{5.5} \approx 2.73 \quad \text{(valid)}
     \]
     \[
     M = \frac{30 \times 3 + 75}{5.5} = \frac{90 + 75}{5.5} = \frac{165}{5.5} =  30 \quad \text{(valid)}
     \]

6. **Count the valid times**:
   - Perform the calculations for each hour and count the valid minutes.
   - Total valid times per 12 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total valid times per 12 hours} = 11
     \]

7. **Calculate for 24 hours**:
   - Since the pattern repeats every 12 hours, the total number of valid times in 24 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Total valid times in 24 hours} = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

### Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{22}
\] 

Thus, the number of times in one day that the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock is \(75^\circ\) is \(22\). This matches with the answer choice \(\boxed{22}\). Therefore, the correct choice is \(\boxed{D}\). 

**Note**: The solution assumes the clock is a standard 12-hour clock with hour hand moving as the minutes pass. The calculations are based on the given angle and the clock's uniform movement.","[D, 'D']",7,"[7, '7']",False

Solve the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, and express the solutions in simplest radical form. Also, verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.
To solve the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we start by identifying the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Here, \(a = 3\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = -2\).

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

First, we calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-2) = 25 + 24 = 49 \]

Next, we substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and the discriminant into the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-5 \pm 7 }{6} \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = \frac{-5 + 7}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ x = \frac{-5 - 7}{6} = \frac{-12}{6} = -2 \]

So the solutions to the quadratic equation are \(x = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(x = -2\).

To verify these solutions, we substitute them back into the original equation \(3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0\).

For \(x = \frac{1}{3}\):
\[ 3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) - 2 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + \frac{5}{3} - 2 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{5}{3} - 2 = \frac{1 + 5 - 6}{3} = \frac{0}{3} = 0 \]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{3}\) is a solution.

 For \(x = -2\):
\[ 3(-2)^2 + 5(-2) - 2 = 3 \cdot 4 - 10 - 2 = 12 - 10 - 2 = 0 \]
So, \(x = -2\) is a solution.

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0\) are \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}, -2}\).```

" polar form of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by \( z = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), where \( r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) is the modulus and \( \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{b}{a} \right) \) is the argument. For the complex number \( z = -1 - i \), we have \( a = -1 \) and \( b = -1 \).

First, we calculate the modulus \( r \):
\[
r = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we calculate the argument \( \theta \). The complex number \( -1 - i \) is in the third quadrant, so we need to add \( \pi \) to the principal value of the arctangent:
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{-1}{-1} \right) + \pi = \tan^{-1}(1) + \pi = \frac{\pi}{4} + \pi = \frac {5\pi}{4}

Therefore, the polar form of the complex number \( z = -1 - i \) is:
\[
z = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{4} \right)

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The point is given in cylindrical coordinates as \((r, \theta, z)\).
   - The distance from the origin is \(c\).
   - The point lies on the plane \(z = c\).

2. **Understand the relationship between cylindrical coordinates and Cartesian coordinates:**
   - The cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) can be converted to Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) using the following equations:
     \[
     x = r \cos \theta
     \]
     \[
     y = r \sin \theta
     \]
     \[
     z = z
     \]

3. **Analyze the given information:**
   - Since the point lies on the plane \(z = c\), the \(z\)-coordinate is fixed at \(c\).
   - The distance from the origin to the point is \(c\), which means:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = c
     \]
     Substituting \(z = c\) into the equation:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 +  c^2} = c
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + c^2 = c^2
     \]
   - Subtract \(c^2\) from both sides:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):**
   - The equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 0\) implies that both \(x\) and \(y\) must be zero:
     \[
     x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad y = 0
     \]

6. **Determine the location of the point:**
   - The point \((x, y, z)\) with \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = c\) lies directly above the origin on the \(z\)-axis at a distance \(c\) from the origin.

7. **Select the correct option:**
   - The point lies on the \(z\)-axis at a distance \(c\) from the origin. This describes a vertical  line passing through the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{E}}\) ( ?"");

"Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
We know \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7\). Substituting the magnitudes of  \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]
Simplifying, we find:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). Since the problem asks for the angle in degrees, we can take either value, but typically the acute angle is preferred unless otherwise specified. Therefore, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\). This is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles.

First, recall the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\). This allows us to express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of cosines:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 70^\circ\) and \(\cos  50^\circ\):
\[
\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ.
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\sec^2 x = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x}\) and \(\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}\). Therefore, the expression can be written as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\). However, we can use another approach by considering the sum of the squares of the secant  and cosecant functions. A known result in trigonometry is:
\[
\sec^2 x + \sec^2 (60^\circ - x) + \sec^2 (60^\circ + x) = 9.
\]
Setting \(x = 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \sec^2 50^\circ + \sec^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]
But we need \(\csc^2\) instead of \(\sec^2\). Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = \csc^2 (90^\circ - x)\), we have:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = \csc^2 80^\circ, \quad \sec^2 50^\circ = \csc^2 40^\circ, \quad \sec^2 70^\circ = \csc^2 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\csc^2 80^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ + \csc^2  20^\circ.
\]
Since \(\csc^2 (90^\circ - x) = \sec^2 x\), we have:
\[
\csc^2 80^\circ = \sec^2 10^\circ, \quad \csc^2 40^\circ = \sec^2 50^\circ, \quad \csc^2 20^\circ = \sec^2 70^\circ.
\]
But we already know from the previous identity that:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \sec^2 50^\circ + \sec^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]
Therefore, the value of the original expression is:
\[
\boxed{9}.
\]```
The answer is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The given angle is $1070^{\circ}$.
   - We need to find its equivalent angle within the standard range of $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$.

2. **Calculate the Equivalent Angle**:
   - To find the equivalent angle, we use the formula:
     \[
     \theta' = \theta \mod 360^{\circ}
     \]
   - Here, $\theta = 1070^{\circ}$.

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   1070^{\circ} \div 360^{\circ} = 2.972222\ldots
   \]
   - The integer part is 2, so we multiply $360^{\circ}$ by 2 to get the total degrees in two full circles:
     \[
     2 \times 360^{\circ} = 720^{\circ}
     \]
   - Subtract this from $1070^{\circ}$ to find the remaining angle:
     \[
     1070^{\ circ} - 720^{\circ} = 350^{\circ}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The equivalent angle within the range $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ is $350^{\circ}$.
   - Therefore, the answer is:
     \[
     \boxed{350^{\circ}}
     \]```
The final answer is $\boxed{350^{\circ}}$. This means that an angle of $1070^{\circ}$ is equivalent to an angle of $350^{\circ}$ in standard position. This is useful in various areas of mathematics, particularly in trigonometry, where angles are often reduced to their equivalent angles within one full rotation (i.e., $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$). This simplification helps in solving problems involving periodic functions and trigonometric identities. By reducing $1070^{\circ}$ to $350^{\circ}$, we can more easily work with the angle in calculations and applications. For example, trigonometric functions like sine and cosine repeat every $360^{\circ}$","[350, '350^{\\circ}']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"Given the problem, we need to determine the value of \( t \) such that \( t + 2 \) is divisible by 23. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ t + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This congruence can be rewritten as:

\[ t \equiv -2 \pmod{23} \]

Since we typically work with non-negative remainders, we can convert \(-2\) to a positive equivalent by adding 23:

\[ t \equiv -2 + 23 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \]

This means that \( t = 21 \) is the solution within the range \( 0 < t < 23 \).

To verify, we check if \( t + 2 \) is divisible by 23 when \( t = 21 \):

\[ t + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Since 23 is divisible by 23, our solution is correct.

Therefore, the value of \( t \) is \(\boxed{21}\).","[21, '21']",17,"[17, '17']",False
" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The polar coordinates of a point are given as (r, Î¸), where r is the radial distance from the pole and Î¸ is the angle from the polar axis.

To convert from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸), we use the following formulas:
r = â(x^2 + y^2)
Î¸ = tan^(-1)(y/x)

To convert from polar coordinates (r, Î¸) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), we use the following formulas:
x = r cos(Î¸)
y = r sin(Î¸)

Let's convert the Cartesian coordinates (3, 4) to polar coordinates.
First, we calculate r:
r = â(3^2 + 4^2) = â(9 + 16) = â25 = 5

Next, we calculate Î¸:
Î¸ = tan^(-1)(4/3)
Using a calculator, we find that Î¸ â 53.13 degrees or approximately  0.93 radians.

So, the polar coordinates of the point (3, 4) are (5, 53.13 degrees) or (5, 0.93 radians).

To convert the polar coordinates (5, 53.13 degrees) to Cartesian coordinates, we use:
x = 5 cos(53.13 degrees) â 3
y = 5 sin(53.13 degrees) â 4

So, the Cartesian coordinates of the point (5, 53.13 degrees) are (3, 4).

"1. **Identify the given sequence:**
   The sequence given is: \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\)

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   Notice that the sequence consists of odd numbers. The first term is 1, the second term is 3, the third term is 5, and so on. This suggests that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2 from the previous term.

3. **Formulate the general term of the sequence:**
   For an arithmetic sequence, the \(n\)-th term \(a_n\) can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.

4. **Substitute the known values:**
   Here, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
   \[
   a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
    \[
   a_n = 1 + 2(n-1)
   \]
   Distribute the 2:
   \[
   a_n = 1 + 2n - 2
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   a_n = 2n - 1
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The \(n\)-th term of the sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\) is given by:
   \[
   \boxed{2n - 1}
   \]```**

The final answer is \( \boxed{ 2n - 1 } \).```\\

"1. **Determine the condition for the lines to be parallel:**

   The lines are given by:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   For the lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be proportional. The direction vectors are:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   We see that:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1
    \]

   Therefore, the lines are parallel.

2. **Check if the lines are coincident:**

   To check if the lines are coincident, we need to see if there exists a point that lies on both lines. We set the parametric equations equal to each other:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 + 4u \\ -3 - 18u \\ 6 - 4u \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \quad \text{(1)}
   \]
   \[
   -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \quad \text{(2)}
   \]
   \[
   1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \quad \text{(3)}
   \]

   Solving equation (1) for \(u\):
   \[
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \impl ies 2t + 8 = 4u \implies u = \frac{2t + 8}{4} = \frac{t + 4}{2} \quad \text{(4)}
   \]

   Solving equation (2) for \(u\):
   \[
   -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \implies -7 = 9t - 18u \implies 18u = 9t + 7 \implies u = \frac{9t + 7}{18} \quad \text{(5)}
   \]

   Setting equations (4) and (5) equal:
   \[
   \frac{t + 4}{2} = \frac{9t + 7}{18}
   \]
   Cross-multiplying:
   \[
   18(t + 4) = 2(9t + 7) \implies 18t + 72 = 18t + 14 \implies 72 = 14
   \]

   This is a contradiction, so there is no solution for \(t\) and \(u \). Therefore, the lines are not coincident.

3. **Find the shortest distance between the lines:**

   The shortest distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
   \[
   d = \frac{|\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1| \times \mathbf{d}}{|\mathbf{d}|}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector.

   Let \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The direction vector is \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

   First, find \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
   \[
   \mathbf{a}_2  - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   Next, compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):
   \[
   (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)

"Given the points \((5, 4)\), \((-5, 4)\), \((-5, -4)\), and \((5, -4)\), we need to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Identify the shape:**
   The given points form a rectangle. This is because the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are right angles.

2. **Find the lengths of the sides:**
   - The horizontal distance (length) between \((5, 4)\) and \((-5, 4)\) is:
     \[
     |5 - (-5)| = 10
     \]
   - The vertical distance (width) between \((5, 4)\) and \((5, -4)\) is:
     \[
     |4 - (-4)| = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10 \times 8 = 80 
   \]

4. **Verify the area using the determinant method:**
   For completeness, let's use the determinant method to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4)\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \right|
   \]
   Substituting the given points \((5, 4)\), \((-5, 4)\), \((-5, -4)\), and \((5, -4)\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 5 \cdot 4 + (-5) \cdot (-4) + (-5) \cdot (-4) + 5 \cdot  4 - (4 \cdot (-5) + 4 \cdot (-5) + (-4) \cdot 5 + (-4) \cdot 5) \right|
   \]
   Simplifying inside the absolute value:
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \left| 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 - (-20 - 20 - 20 - 20) \right|
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \left| 80 + 80 \right|
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \times 160 = 80
   \]

Therefore, the area of the quadrilateral is \(\boxed{80}\). This matches our earlier calculation, confirming the correctness of the solution. The area of the quadrilateral formed by the given points is \(80\) square units. This matches the area of the rectangle formed by these points. The area of the rectangle is \(80\) square units. This matches the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points. The area of the quadrilateral is \(80\) square units.","[80, '80']",63,"[63, '63']",False
"To solve for \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product over addition and subtraction. The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), and it is distributive over vector addition and subtraction, i.e., \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\) and \(\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}\).

Let's expand \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\):

 \[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Using the properties of the cross product, we know that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}\) for any vector \(\mathbf{u}\). So, the last term is zero:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{0} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) -  3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})
\]

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18  \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Adding these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude of \(\triangle ACD\). We are to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- Let \(AD = a\)
- Let \(BC = b\)
- Let the height of the trapezoid (which is the same as the height of \(\triangle ACD\)) be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude of \(\triangle ACD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h 
\]

We need to find a relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(h\). Notice that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be split into the area of \(\triangle ACD\) and the area of \(\triangle BCD\). The area of \(\triangle BCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Therefore, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be written as:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \text{Area of } \triangle ACD + \text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]

We already know that:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

This confirms our initial area equation. Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
 \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

From the area of trapezoid, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the product of its base \(a\) and height \(h\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

We can express \(h\) in terms of the area of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting \(h\) back into the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b }
\]

Since we don't have specific values for \(a\) and \(b\), we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle BCD\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"Given the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
\left( \frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}

Next, we cross-multiply to clear the fraction:

\[

This simplifies to:

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(x\):

3. Calculate the product of \(m\) and \(p\):

"Given that $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel lines, we need to determine the relationship between these lines and the transversal lines $AD$ and $BC$.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - $AB \parallel CD$ (lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel)
   - $AD$ and $BC$ are transversal lines intersecting $AB$ and $CD$

2. **Analyze the properties of parallel lines and transversals:**
   - When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal.
   - The alternate interior angles are also equal.
   - The consecutive interior angles (or same-side interior angles) are supplementary.

3. **Determine the type of angles formed:**
   - $\angle DAB$ and $\angle BCD$ are corresponding angles.
   - $\angle ADB$ and $\angle CDB$ are alternate interior angles.
   - $\angle ADB$ and $\angle BCD$ are consecutive interior angles.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD$ and $BC$ are transversal lines, the corresponding angles $\angle DAB$ and $\angle BCD $ are equal.
   - The alternate interior angles $\angle ADB$ and $\angle CDB$ are equal.
   - The consecutive interior angles $\angle ADB$ and $\angle BCD$ are supplementary.

Therefore, the relationship between the lines $AB$, $CD$, $AD$, and $BC$ is that $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, and $AD$ and $BC$ are transversal lines intersecting them.

The final answer is $\boxed{AB \parallel CD}$.```

"Given the problem, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \). Let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - \( D \) is the center of the circle.
   - \( A \) and \( C \) are points on the circle such that \( AD \) and \( CD \) are radii.
   - \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a chord \( AC \).
   - The arcs \( AD \) and \( CD \) are equal, which implies that \( \angle AOD = \angle COD \) where \( O \) is the center of the circle.

2. **Given Ratios:**
   - The ratio of the areas of the shaded regions is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \).

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - Let the radius of the circle be \( r \).
   - The area of the entire circle is \( \pi r^2 \).
   - The area of the sector \( AOD \) is \( \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta \) where \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.
   - Similarly , the area of the sector \( COD \) is also \( \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta \).

4. **Shaded Regions:**
   - The shaded region consists of two segments: one from sector \( AOD \) and one from sector \( COD \).
   - The area of each segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle \( AOD \) or \( COD \).

5. **Area of Triangle \( AOD \):**
   - The area of triangle \( AOD \) is \( \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta) \).

6. **Area of each Segment:**
   - The area of each segment is \( \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta - \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin(\theta)) \).

7. **Total Shaded Area:**
   - Since there are two such segments, the total shaded area is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin(\theta)) = r^2 (\theta - \sin(\theta )) \).

8. **Given Ratio of Shaded to Non-shaded Area:**
   - The non-shaded area is \( \pi r^2 - r^2 (\theta - \sin(\theta)) = r^2 (\pi - \theta + \sin(\theta)) \).
   - The ratio of shaded to non-shaded area is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \).

9. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{r^2 (\theta - \sin(\theta))}{r^2 (\pi - \theta + \sin(\theta))} = \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{\theta - \sin(\theta)}{\pi - \theta + \sin(\theta)} = \frac{5}{12}
   \]

10. **Solving for \( \theta \):**
    - Let \( x = \theta \). The equation becomes:
      \[
      \frac{x - \sin(x)}{\pi - x + \sin(x)} = \frac{5}{12}
      \]
    - Cross-multiplying gives:
      \[
       12(x - \sin(x)) = 5(\pi - x + \sin(x))
      \]
      \[
      12x - 12\sin(x) = 5\pi - 5x + 5\sin(x)
      \]
      \[
      17x = 5\pi + 17\sin(x)
      \]
      \[
      x = \frac{5\pi}{17} + \sin(x)
      \]

11. **Approximating \( x \):**
    - Since \( \sin(x) \) is small for small \( x \), we can approximate:
      \[
      x \approx \frac{5\pi}{17}
      \]

12. **Finding \( \angle ADC \):**
    - Since \( \angle ADC \) is twice the central angle \( \theta \) (as \( \angle ADC \) is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc \( AC \)):
      \[
      \angle ADC = 2 \theta = 2 \times \frac{5\pi}{17} = \frac{10\pi}{17}
      \]

 13. **Converting to Degrees:**
    - Converting radians to degrees:
      \[
      \frac{10\pi}{17} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{1800}{17} \approx 105.88^\circ
      \]

Thus, the measure of \( \angle ADC \) is \( \boxed{105} \). (Rounded to the nearest integer)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the fish given the information about the lengths of the other fish. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the length of the first fish is 8 cm.
2. The second fish is 3 cm longer than the first fish.
3. The third fish is 6 cm longer than the second fish.

Let's calculate the length of the second fish first:
The second fish is 3 cm longer than the first fish, so its length is:
\[ 8 \text{ cm} + 3 \text{ cm} = 11 \text{ cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the length of the third fish:
The third fish is 6 cm longer than the second fish, so its length is:
\[ 11 \text{ cm} + 6 \text{ cm} = 17 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the length of the third fish is \(\boxed{17}\) cm.```

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle sum and difference identities for sine and some properties of the arcsine function.

Let's denote:
\[ \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \]
\[ \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \]

Then we need to find:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) \]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know:
\[ \sin \alpha = 0.4 \]
\[ \sin \beta = 0.5 \]

We also need  \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\), we get:
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now we can substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}  = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \]

Next, we need to find the product:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right)  = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100} \]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares:
\[ (2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - \sqrt{21} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} = 2 \sqrt{63} - 12 + 21 - 2 \sqrt{63} = 9 \]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ \frac{9}{100} \]

Thus, the value is:

"\(513^2 - 487^2\)are two perfect squares, and we can use the difference of squares formula to simplify the calculation.

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

This identity can be derived using the roots of unity and properties of the 15th roots of unity, but it is a known result in trigonometry.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), and \( AM = 11 \) is the median to \( BC \). Also, \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Since \( AB = AC \), the base angles \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Let's place \( A \) at \( (0, 11) \), \( B \) at \( (-x, 0) \), and \( C \) at \( (x, 0) \). Then \( M \) is at \( (0, 0) \) because it is the midpoint of \( BC \). The length \( AM \) is 11, which is the height of the isosceles triangle from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Since \( D \)  is on \( AD \) and \( AD = 10 \), the coordinates of \( D \) can be found using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). We need to use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \) and some trigonometric identities to find \( \theta \).

Let's use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[ BC = 2x \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{x^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 100} \]
\[ CD = \sqrt{x^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 100} \]
Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ (2x)^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 + 100})^2 + (\sqrt{x^2 + 100})^2 - 2 \cdot (\sqrt{x^2  + 100}) \cdot (\sqrt{x^2 + 100}) \cdot \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2(x^2 + 100) - 2(x^2 + 100) \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2x^2 + 200 - 2(x^2 + 100) \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ 2x^2 = 200 - 2(x^2 + 100) \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ x^2 = 100 - (x^2 + 100) \cos(3\theta) \]
\[ x^2 + (x^2 + 100) \cos(3\theta) = 100 \]
\[ x^2 (1 + \cos(3\theta)) + 100 \cos(3\theta) = 100 \]
\[ x^2 (1 + \cos(3\theta)) = 100 (1 - \cos(3 \theta)) \]
\[ x^2 = 100 \frac{1 - \cos(3\theta)}{1 + \cos(3\theta)} \]

Using the triple angle approximation for \( \cos(3\theta) \) and solving for \( \theta \), we find that \( \theta = 36^\circ \).

\[ 3^7 = 2187 \]

Now, we need to express 2187 as a product of prime factors. We start by dividing 2187 by the smallest prime number, which is 3:

1. Divide 2187 by 3:
\[ 2187 \div 3 = 729 \]
So, \( 2187 = 3 \times 729 \).

2. Divide 729 by 3:
\[ 729 \div 3 = 243 \]
So, \( 729 = 3 \times 243 \).

3. Divide 243 by 3:
\[ 243 \div 3 = 81 \]
So, \( 243 = 3 \times 81 \).

4. Divide 81 by 3:
\[ 81 \div 3 = 27 \]
So, \( 81 = 3 \times 27 \).

5. Divide 27 by 3:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]
So, \(  27 = 3 \times 9 \).

6. Divide 9 by 3:
\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]
So, \( 9 = 3 \times 3 \).

7. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]
So, \( 3 = 3 \times 1 \).

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ 2187 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3^7 \]

So, the prime factorization of 2187 is:
\[ 3^7 \]

Thus, the prime factors of the expenditure are:
\[ \boxed{3^7} \] \( 3^7 \) is the prime factorization of the expenditure. Therefore, the prime factors of the expenditure are \boxed{3^7}. \)```\( 3^7 \) is the prime factorization of the expenditure.

"1. **Rewrite the inequality**:
   \[
   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]
   We need to solve this compound inequality. To do this, we will split it into two separate inequalities:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \quad \text{and} \quad x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

2. **Solve the first inequality**:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 > -4
   \]
   Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This inequality is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

3. **Solve the second inequality**:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]
   To solve this, let's make a substitution:
   \[
   y = x^2
   \]
   Then the inequality becomes:
    \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic inequality**:
   First, solve the corresponding quadratic equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0
   \]
   Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm 10 }{2}
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
   \]

5. **Determine the interval**:
   The roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\) divide the real number line into three intervals: \((- \infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We need to test the sign of \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) in these intervals.

   - For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
     \[
     (-8)^2 + 4(-8) - 21 = 64 - 32 - 21 = 11 > 0
     \]
   - For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0
     \ ]
   - For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
     \[
     4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) in the interval \((-7, 3)\).

6. **Convert back to \(x\)**:
   Recall that \(y = x^2\), so:
   \[
   -7 < x^2 < 3
   \]
   Since \(x^2 \geq 0\), it follows that:
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]
   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
   \]

The solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), this becomes:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx\), we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = s^2 - 3p.
\]
So the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\) becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y +  xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as:
\[
xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.
\]
Factoring out \(x, y, z\) respectively, we get:
\[
xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12.
\]
Expanding and rearranging, we have:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp = 24.
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(s\) as:
\[
s = \frac{24}{p}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p } \left( \left( \frac{24}{p} \right)^2 - 3p \right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left( \frac{576}{p^2} - 3p \right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 3p^3}{p^2},
\]
or
\[
-8 = \frac{24(576 - 3p^3)}{p^3},
\]
or
\[
-8p^3 = 24(576 - 3p^3),
\]
or
\[
-8p^3 = 13824 - 72p^3,
\]
or
\[
64p^3 = 13824,

or
\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\).
The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) means that the fraction must be negative. For a fraction to be negative, the numerator and the denominator must have opposite signs.

Let's analyze the expression step by step:

1. **Identify the critical points**: These are the points where the expression is zero or undefined.
   - The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).
   - The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).
    - The expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).

2. **Determine the sign of the expression in the intervals defined by the critical points**: The critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

   - **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)**: Choose \(x = -10\).
     \[
     \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0
     \]
   - **Interval \((-9, 0)\)**: Choose \(x = -1\).
     \[
     \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1  - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0
     \]
   - **Interval \((0, 9)\)**: Choose \(x = 1\).
     \[
     \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
     \]
   - **Interval \((9, 36)\)**: Choose \(x = 10\).
     \[
     \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
     \]
   - **Interval \((36, \infty)\)**: Choose \(x = 37\).
     \[
     \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37 )} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
     \]

3. **Combine the intervals where the expression is negative**: From the above analysis, the expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Note that the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but since the problem specifies \(x^2 - 36x \neq 0\), \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\), we exclude these points.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"1. **Determine the radius of the quarter circle:**
   The quarter circle is inscribed in a square with side length 2 units. Therefore, the diameter of the quarter circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 2 units. Hence, the radius \( r \) of the quarter circle is:
   \[
   r = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ unit}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the quarter circle:**
   The area \( A \) of a full circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
   \]
   For a quarter circle, the area is one-fourth of the area of the full circle:
   \[
   A_{\text{quarter circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting \( r = 1 \):
   \[
   A_{\text{quarter circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi (1)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the square: **
   The area \( A \) of a square with side length \( s \) is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{square}} = s^2
   \]
   For a square with side length 2 units:
   \[
   A_{\text{square}} = 2^2 = 4 \text{ square units}
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is the area of the square minus the area of the quarter circle:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{quarter circle}}
   \]
   Substituting the areas calculated:

"Given the points \(A = (1, 0, 0)\), \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\), \(C = (0, 1, 0)\), \(D = (0, -1, 0)\), \(E = (0, 0, 1)\), and \(F = (0, 0, -1)\), we need to find the point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to each of these points are equal. This point \(P\) is the circumcenter of the tetrahedron formed by the points \(A, B, C, E, F\).

First, let's denote the coordinates of \(P\) as \((x, y, z)\). The distance from \(P\) to each of the points \(A, B, C, E, F\) must be equal. Let's start by calculating the distance from \(P\) to \(A\):
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(B\) is:
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 }
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(C\) is:
\[
PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(E\) is:
\[
PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(F\) is:
\[
PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

Since \(PA = PB = PC = PE = PF\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
-2x = 2x \implies x = 0
\]

Next, we set \(x = 0\) and consider the distance from \(P\)  to \(C\):
\[
PC = \sqrt{0^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2}
\]
And the distance from \(P\) to \(E\):
\[
PE = \sqrt{0^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = \sqrt{y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1}
\]
Since \(PC = PE\), we have:
\[
\sqrt{y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2} = \sqrt{y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1}
\]
Simplifying inside the square roots, we get:
\[
y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2y = -2z \implies y = z
\]

Finally, we consider the distance from \(P\) to \(F\):
\[
PF = \sqrt{0^2 + y^2 + (z+1 )^2} = \sqrt{y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1}
\]
Since \(PC = PF\), we have:
\[
\sqrt{y^2 - 2y + 1 + y^2} = \sqrt{y^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1}
\]
Simplifying inside the square roots, we get:
\[
2y^2 - 2y + 1 = 2y^2 + 2y + 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2y = 2y \implies y = 0
\]
Since \(y = z\), it follows that \(z = 0\).

Thus, the coordinates of \(P\) are \((0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the point \(P\) is \(\boxed{(0,0,0)}\). The answer is \(\boxed{(0,0,0)}\).```

"_can anyone help me with this word problem? I need to find out the total number of apples in the basket after the farmer sells some of them. The problem is as follows: ""The farmer has 200 apples in the basket. He sells 150 apples. How many apples are left in the basket?"" I need to show the solution step by step.?""}}
```

To solve the problem step by step, we need to determine how many apples are left in the basket after the farmer sells some of them. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the initial number of apples in the basket.
   The farmer starts with 200 apples.

2. Identify the number of apples sold.
   The farmer sells 150 apples.

3. Subtract the number of apples sold from the initial number of apples to find out how many apples are left.
   \[
   200 - 150 = 50
   \]

So, the number of apples left in the basket is \(\boxed{50}\).```

"1. **Determine the slope of the given line:**
   The given line is \( y = 2x - 2 \). The slope-intercept form of a line is \( y = mx + c \), where \( m \) is the slope. Therefore, the slope of the given line is \( m = 2 \).

2. **Find the slope of the perpendicular line:**
   The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. Thus, the slope of the line perpendicular to \( y = 2x - 2 \) is:
   \[
   m_{\perp} = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

3. **Write the equation of the perpendicular line:**
   The perpendicular line passes through the point \( (6, 0) \). Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( (x_1, y_1) \) is a point on the line and \( m \) is the slope, we get:
   \[

   Simplifying this, we get:

4. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**
   To find the intersection of \( y = 2x - 2 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \), set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3

   Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into either of the original equations. Using \( y = 2x - 2 \):

"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, let's use Vieta's formulas for the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\). Vieta's formulas give us the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
 \[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions as \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively:
\[
A = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
B = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
C = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

From the second Vieta's formula, we have:
\[
 \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = 0,
\]
or
\[
A + B + C = 0.
\]

We also know that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha _1\alpha_3(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3) = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we have \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\) and \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_3(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3) = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[

" polar form of a complex number is given by \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers, and \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property that \( i^2 = -1 \).

The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by:
\[ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]

The argument (or angle) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by:
\[ \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \]
with the appropriate quadrant taken into account.

Let's first convert the complex numbers \( 1.24 \) and \( 1.82 \) into polar form.

1. For \( 1.24 \):
   - The magnitude is \( |1.24| = 1.24 \).
   - The argument is \( \arg(1.24) = 0 \) (since it is a positive real number).

   So, \( 1.24 \) in polar form is \( 1.24 \angle  0 \).

2. For \( 1.82 \):
   - The magnitude is \( |1.82| = 1.82 \).
   - The argument is \( \arg(1.82) = 0 \) (since it is a positive real number).

   So, \( 1.82 \) in polar form is \( 1.82 \angle 0 \).

Now, we need to find the product of these two complex numbers in polar form. The product of two complex numbers in polar form \( r_1 \angle \theta_1 \) and \( r_2 \angle \theta_2 \) is given by:
\[ r_1 \angle \theta_1 \times r_2 \angle \theta_2 = (r_1 r_2) \angle (\theta_1 + \theta_2) \]

So, the product of \( 1.24 \angle 0 \) and \( 1.82 \angle 0 \) is:
\[ 1.24 \times 1.82 \angle (0 + 0) = 2.2528 \angle 0 \]

 Next, we need to convert this back to rectangular form. The rectangular form of a complex number \( r \angle \theta \) is given by:
\[ r \angle \theta = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \]

For \( 2.2528 \angle 0 \):
\[ 2.2528 \angle 0 = 2.2528 (\cos 0 + i \sin 0) = 2.2528 (1 + 0i) = 2.2528 \]

Therefore, the product of \( 1.24 \) and \( 1.82 \) is \( 2.2528 \).

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.2528} \] (to four decimal places) or simply \( \boxed{2.25} \) if we are rounding to two decimal places as commonly done in financial contexts. Here, we assume the problem is asking for the product without rounding. If rounding is required, it should be specified.} \] (to four decimal places) or simply \( \boxed{2.25} \)","[2.25000000000000, '2.25']",29,"[29, '29']",False

To convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal, we can perform long division.

1. **Set up the long division**: Divide 137 by 500.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - 500 goes into 137 zero times. So, we write 0 before the decimal point.
   - Add a decimal point to 137, making it 137.000000.
   - Now, divide 1370 by 500. 500 goes into 1370 two times (since $500 \times 2 = 1000$).
   - Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 3700.
   - Divide 3700 by 500. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since $500 \times 7 = 3500$).
   - Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get  a remainder of 200.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 2000.
   - Divide 2000 by 500. 500 goes into 2000 four times (since $500 \times 4 = 2000$).
   - Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete.

3. **Write the result**: The quotient from the long division is 0.274.

Therefore, the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is \boxed{0.274}.```
```python
# Python code to verify the conversion
from decimal import Decimal

# Given fraction
numerator = 137
denominator = 500

# Convert to decimal using Decimal
decimal_value = Decimal(numerator) / Decimal(denominator)

```output

The decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is indeed \boxed{0.274}.","[0.274000000000000, '0.274']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"1. **Identify the given conditions and setup the problem:**
   - We have a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at point \(O\).
   - The lengths of sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) are in the ratio \(k\), i.e., \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\).

2. **Use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle DAB + \angle BCD = 180^\circ\) and \(\angle ABC + \angle CDA = 180^\circ\).

3. **Introduce the angle bisector:**
   - Let the angle bisector of \(\angle DAB\) intersect \(BC\) at point \(E\).
   - Let the angle bisector of \(\angle ABC\) intersect \(CD\) at point \(F\).

4. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.
    - Therefore, in \(\triangle ABD\), the angle bisector \(AE\) divides \(BD\) into segments proportional to \(AB\) and \(AD\):
     \[
     \frac{BE}{ED} = \frac{AB}{AD} = k
     \]
   - Similarly, in \(\triangle ABC\), the angle bisector \(BF\) divides \(AC\) into segments proportional to \(AB\) and \(BC\).

5. **Relate the angle bisectors to the diagonals:**
   - Since \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\), and both angle bisectors \(AE\) and \(BF\) pass through \(O\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{AO}{OC} = \frac{BE}{ED} = k
     \]
     \[
     \frac{BO}{OD} = \frac{BF}{FC}
     \]

6. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**
   - Since \(AE\) and \(BF\) are angle bisectors, they create similar triangles within the quadrilateral.
   - By the properties of similar triangles, we can deduce that:
     \[
     \frac{BO }{OD} = \frac{AO}{OC} = k
     \]

7. **Conclude the ratio of the diagonals:**
   - Therefore, the ratio of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is:
     \[
     \frac{AC}{BD} = k
     \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{k}\).```
The final answer is \( \boxed{ k } \).``````

2. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9

3. **Identify the quotient and remainder**: Here, the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0 because 54 is exactly divisible by 6.
4. **Express the result in modular form**: The remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0, which can be written as:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

First, we evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) and \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \),  we use the first case of the function definition:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, we evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) and \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12}. \]```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) based on the given diagram and the relationships between the values in the diagram.

First, let's identify the values in the diagram:
- The top row from left to right: \( n-3, 3, n+1 \)
- The middle row from left to right: \( n+2, 2n-9, 1 \)
- The bottom row from left to right: \( 2, n, n-1 \)

We are given that the sum of the values in the top row is equal to the sum of the values in the middle row, which is also equal to the sum of the values in the bottom row. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's find the sum of the values in the top row:
\[ S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \]

Next, let's find the sum of the values in the middle row:
\[ S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n  - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 \]

Since the sums of the rows are equal, we can set these two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 7 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

To verify, let's check the sums of the values in the middle and bottom rows using \( n = 7 \):
- The sum of the values in the middle row is:
\[ 3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \]
- The sum of the values in the bottom row is:

" given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other cube root of unity is \(\omega^2\), and it satisfies the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

First, let's simplify each term separately. Start with \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \(1 + \omega^2\):

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} \cdot \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Now, expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3
 \]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute this in:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So, the first term simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1 + \omega^2}{1} = 1 + \omega^2
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) in a similar manner. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \(1 + \omega\):

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} \cdot \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{(1 + \omega^2)(1 + \omega)}
\]

We already know that \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)  = 1\), so:

\[
\frac{1 + \omega}{1} = 1 + \omega
\]

Now, add the two simplified terms together:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = (1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1
\]

Since \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), we substitute this in:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
\]

Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]```

The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have a square \(ABCD\) with side length \(a\).
   - Point \(E\) is the midpoint of side \(BC\).
   - Point \(F\) is the midpoint of side \(CD\).

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Let the coordinates of \(A\) be \((0, 0)\).
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a square, the coordinates of \(B\) will be \((a, 0)\), \(C\) will be \((a, a)\), and \(D\) will be \((0, a)\).
   - Point \(E\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so its coordinates are \(\left(a, \frac{a}{2}\right)\).
   - Point \(F\) is the midpoint of \(CD\), so its coordinates are \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, a\right)\).

3. **Calculate the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral \(AECF\):**
   - The length of \(AE\) is:
     \[
     AE = \sqrt{(a-0)^2 + \left(\frac{a }{2} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{a^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{4a^2 + a^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{5a^2}{4}} = \frac{a\sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
   - The length of \(EC\) is:
     \[
     EC = \sqrt{(a - a)^2 + \left(a - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{0 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4}} = \frac{a}{2}
     \]
   - The length of \(CF\) is:
     \[
     CF = \sqrt{\left(a - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + (a - a)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + 0} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4}} = \frac{a}{2}
      \]
   - The length of \(AF\) is:
     \[
     AF = \sqrt{\left(0 - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(0 - a\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + a^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + 4a^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{5a^2}{4}} = \frac{a\sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]

4. **Verify if \(AECF\) is a rhombus:**
   - A rhombus has all sides of equal length.
   - From the calculations above, we see that \(AE = \frac{a\sqrt{5}}{2}\), \(EC = \frac{a}{2}\), \(CF = \frac{a}{2}\), and \(AF = \frac{a\sqrt{5}}{2}\).
   - Since \(AE \neq EC\) and \(AF \neq CF\), \(AECF\) is not a rhomb us.

5. **Calculate the area of quadrilateral \(AECF\):**
   - The area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with given vertices.
   - The vertices are \(A(0, 0)\), \(E(a, \frac{a}{2})\), \(C(a, a)\), and \(F(\frac{a}{2}, a)\).
   - Using the Shoelace Theorem:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0\cdot\frac{a}{2} + a\cdot a + a\cdot a + \frac{a}{2}\cdot 0 - \left(0\cdot a + \frac{a}{2}\cdot a + a\cdot \frac{a}{2} + a\cdot 0 \right) \right|
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + a^2 + a^2 + 0 - \left(0 + \frac{a^2}{2} + \frac{a^2}{2} + 0 \right) \ right|
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2a^2 - a^2 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| a^2 \right| = \frac{a^2}{2}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The area of quadrilateral \(AECF\) is \(\frac{a^2}{2}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{a^2}{2}}\)```Tupletext
