"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DE\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
We know that \(EF = 7\) (from the diagram). Let \(DE = x\). Then we can write:
\[
\frac{7}{x} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(x\), we rearrange the equation:
\[
7 = 0.7x
\]
Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get:
\[
x = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\). This is obtained by using the definition of the sine","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise :**
   Rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise corresponds to multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
    \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the result is:

The final answer is \( \boxed{ 6 - 5i } \). This is the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise. The steps involve translating \( z \) to the origin, rotating it, and then translating it back. The calculations involve basic operations with complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a complex exponential for rotation.

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize the number 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square:
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11^2\]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

 Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:
\[\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\]```

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3 people as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""people"" around the round table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the 3 people within their block:**
   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4.  **Combine the arrangements:**
   To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the total number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that is a constant, which means the exponent of \(x\) in that term must be zero.

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify each part of the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)}  = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^2)^{-k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Now, combine these results:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5-k} \cdot x^{15-3k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} \cdot x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5-k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} \cdot x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

Simplify the exponent of \(x\):

\[
x^{15-3k-2k} = x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

 Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^{5-3} \cdot (-1)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{2^3}
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
(-1)^3 = -1
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125 The final answer is  \boxed{-125}","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, calculate the product:

 \[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the product is:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).\\

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center and still look the same.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5, which means it can be rotated to 5 different positions that look identical. The angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position is given by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of positions of symmetry, which is 5.

So, we calculate the rotation angle as follows:
\[
\text{Rotation angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise until it coincides with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).\\

"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). We will use the midpoints of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

First, calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

 Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be the same:
\[
\left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
1. \(6 = \frac{6+x}{2}\)
2. \(\frac{7}{2} = \frac{8+y}{2}\)

Solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 = \frac{6+x}{2}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
12 = 6 + x
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
x = 6
\]

Solve the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{7}{2} = \frac{8+y}{2}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
7 = 8 + y
\]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\).

Finally, calculate \(x + y\):
\[
 x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{5}\).```

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We start by solving the equation for the denominator:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it as follows:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

###  Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches infinity. We do this by examining the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have determined that:
- The vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).
- The horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

Now, we sum these values:

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm (or operator norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of \( \frac{\|A\bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|} \) for all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\).

First, let's compute the operator norm of \( A \). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^*A \), where \( A^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( A \). Since \( A \) is a real matrix, \( A^* = A^T \), the transpose of \( A \).  Thus,
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, we compute \( A^*A \):
\[
A^*A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^*A \). The eigenvalues of \( A^*A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \( \det(A^*A - \lambda I) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. So we have:
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 16 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue:
\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

Finally, convert \(36_{10}\) back to base \(9 \). To do this, we divide \(36\) by \(9\) to find the digits of the base \(9\) number:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
Thus, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second term with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
 \]

We recognize that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) from the Pythagorean identity. Substituting this identity into the numerator, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( T \) represents the weight of one treek.
- \( S \) represents the weight of one squig.
- \( G \) represents the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the number of treeks that equal the weight of one squig. Let \( x \) be the number of treeks that equal the weight of one squig. Therefore, we need to solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[
xT = S
\]

First, we solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute \( G = S - 2T \) into the first equation:
 \[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
10T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to combine like terms:
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( S \):
\[
3T = S
\]

Now we have \( S = 3T \). Substitute \( S = 3T \) back into the equation \( xT = S \):
\[
xT = 3T
\]

Divide both sides by \( T \) (assuming \( T \neq 0 \)):
\[

Therefore, the number of treeks that equal the weight of one squig is \(\boxed{3}\).```

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term separately:

\[

\]
\[

\]
\[

\[

\[

\[

\[

\]

Group the like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations :

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)

3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the fourth equation:

\[

"To determine the radius of the tank, we start by understanding the relationship between the volume of water added, the rate at which it is added, and the dimensions of the tank.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

In this problem, the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that every hour, the height of the water in the tank increases by 4 meters.

The volume of water added in one hour is equal to the rate at which the tank is being filled:
\[ \text{Volume added per hour} = \pi r^2 \cdot \text{height added per hour} \]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and ensure that it is continuous and covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's ensure that the function is continuous at \(x = a\). For continuity, the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\).

Calculate the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

Calculate the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\ ):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearrange this equation to find \(a\):
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factor out \(a\):
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

Solve the quadratic equation \(a^2 - a - 2 = 0\):
\[
a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:
\[
a = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad a = -1.
\]

Since \(a\) must be a non-negative number (as \(x \geq a\) in the quadratic piece), we discard \(a = -1\). Thus, \(a = 2\).

 Next, we need to verify that \(a = 2\) ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once. With \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.

\]

The function \(2x^2\) for \(x \geq 2\) covers all values starting from \(2 \cdot 2^2 = 8\) and increases without bound as \(x\) increases. The function \(2x + 4\) for \(x < 2\) covers all values from \(-\infty\) up to but not including \(2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8\).

Since both pieces of the function cover the entire range of \(y\)-values, from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\), the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once.

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\ The final answer is  \(\boxed{2}.\)","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \( (h, k) \) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

### Completing the square for \( x \):
1. Start with the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 25 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
    \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25
   \]

### Completing the square for \( y \):
1. Start with the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \( 6 \), divide by 2 to get \( 3 \), and then square it to get \( 9 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 9 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (y+3)^2 - 9
   \]

### Combining the completed squares and constant terms:
Now, substitute the completed squares back into the original equation:
\[
x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
\]
\[
(x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]
Combine the constants:
\[
(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c  = 0
\]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[
(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

### Setting the equation to the standard form:
For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \):
\[
34 - c = 1
\]

### Solving for \( c \):
\[
34 - c = 1
\]
\[
34 - 1 = c
\]
\[
c = 33
\]

Thus, the value of \( c \) that makes the radius of the circle 1 is \(\boxed{33}\). \\

"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the given function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the points where \(f(x) = x\). This means solving the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\ ]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0.
\]
The second inequality is always true. Therefore, the condition \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so we have:
\[
f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation:
\ [
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) and \(f(f(x)) = 0\), which does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we can divide both sides by \(x\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to find \(\lambda\) such that this equation has a solution for \(x \in (0,1)\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). From the earlier analysis, we know that \(f(x) = x\) has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify this expression. Recall that \(\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos  (A+B) + \cos (A-B)]\) and \(\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A-B) - \cos (A+B)]\). Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],
\]
\[
-\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = -\frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ],
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ].
\]

Adding these together, we have:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ -  \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ].

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [2 \cos 25^\circ + 2 \cos 85^\circ] = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ellsips,"" we need to account for the repeated letters. The word ""ellsips"" is composed of 7 letters, including two E's, two L's, and two S's.

First, we will calculate the total number of permutations of the letters without considering any repetitions:

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we need to adjust for the repeated letters. Since there are two E's, two L's, and two S's, we divide by the factorial of the number of times each letter is repeated. This accounts for the fact that swapping identical letters does not produce a new arrangement.

The calculation is as follows:

First, note that if \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(y = \cos \phi\), then \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sin \theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sin \phi\). Therefore, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x, y) = x \sin \phi + y \sin \theta. \]

We can interpret \(x\) and \(y\) as the cosine and sine of some angles \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) respectively. This means that we can consider the expression as a dot product of two vectors \((\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\) and \((\cos \phi, \sin \phi)\), which are unit vectors. The maximum value of the dot product of two unit vectors is 1, which occurs when the vectors are parallel.

 To achieve this, we can set \(\theta = \phi\). Then, \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(y = \cos \theta\), and the function becomes:

The maximum value of \(\sin 2\theta\) is 1, which occurs when \(2\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\). Therefore, \(x = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) and \(y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1  & b_2 & b_3 \end{vmatrix}
\]

For our vectors:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We expand this determinant:
\[
= \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
 \[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{180}
\]
\[
= 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[

\[

\[

Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number that satisfies a quadratic equation. Let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is the golden ratio. The quadratic equation for \( z \) is:

\[ z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this quadratic equation are:

\[ z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2}. \]

Since \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \alpha^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore, \( \alpha^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}  - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Thus, the roots are:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

However, we don't need the explicit form of \( z \) to solve the problem. Instead, we use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \), so \( z \) satisfies \( z^2 = \alpha z - 1 \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). First, let's find the powers of \( z \) modulo the characteristic polynomial. Notice that \( z^2 = \alpha z - 1 \), so \( z^3 = z \cdot  z^2 = z(\alpha z - 1) = \alpha z^2 - z = \alpha(\alpha z - 1) - z = \alpha^2 z - \alpha - z = (\alpha^2 - 1)z - \alpha = (\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1)z - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}z - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \alpha(z - 1) \).

We can use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are conjugates and the powers of \( z \) will also be conjugates. The sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with period 2. Specifically, \( z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \alpha \) and \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \alpha^2 - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + The final answer is  \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To solve for the area of triangle \(三人 \), we start by analyzing the given problem and using properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Centroid Properties**:
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \). This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Parallel Line and Similar Triangles**:
   The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

3. **Ratio of Similar Triangles**:
   Because \( MN \parallel BC \), the corresponding sides of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are proportional. The ratio of similarity between \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is the same as the ratio of the segments cut by the parallel line on the sides \( AB \) and \( AC \).  Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \). Therefore, the ratio of similarity is \( \frac{AG}{AB} = \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Area Ratio**:
   The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}
   \]

5. **Area of \( \triangle AMN \)**:
   Given that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
   \]

6. **Area of \( \triangle GMN \)**:
   Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides \( \triangle AMN \) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle GMN \ ) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle GMN = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}
   \]

7. **Area of \( \triangle GMN \)**:
   The area of \( \triangle GMN \) is the same as the area of \( \triangle GMN \) because \( G \) is the centroid and the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) creates two congruent triangles on either side of \( G \).

8. **Area of \( \triangle W G N \)**:
   Since \( W \) is not defined in the problem, we assume \( W \) is a typo and should be \( M \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle W G N \) is the same as the area of \( \triangle GMN \).

Thus, the area of \( \triangle W G N \) is:

The number of math books remaining on the middle shelf is 8. To find the fraction of the remaining books that are math books, we divide the number of math books by the total number of remaining books:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to determine the first term and the common difference of the sequence. Let's denote the first term by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

Given that the fourth term is 200, we can write:
\[a + 3d = 200\]

Given that the eighth term is 500, we can write:
\[a + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
 \[a + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = 200 - 225\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have \(a = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term of the sequence. The sixth term is given by:
\[a_6 = a + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

Therefore, the sixth term is \(\boxed{350}\).```

This equation tells us that \( 24 = an \). To find the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) that satisfy this equation, we need to determine the number of divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is:

The total number of divisors of 24 is given by multiplying the incremented exponents in the prime factorization:

Let \( d \) represent the number of dimes and \( n \) represent the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 0.10d + 0.05n = 0.75 \)

First, we'll clear the decimals in the second equation by multiplying every term by 100:

Next, we'll simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

Now we have a system of linear equations:

2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2d + n) - (d + n)  = 15 - 11 \]

So, Hillary has 4 dimes. Now we substitute \( d = 4 \) back into the first equation to find \( n \):

Next, we determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the numbers chosen is even. This can happen in two scenarios:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00 or 25. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Since the only digits are 0 and 1, the number must have a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9.

Given these conditions, the number must end in 00 and contain a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9 . The smallest such number is 11111111100, because it ends in 00 and has nine 1's, which sum to 9 (a multiple of 9).

Let's verify:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits is \(9\), which is a multiple of 9, so it is divisible by 9.

We need to find the pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) is the remainder from the first spin and \(b\) is the remainder from the second spin, such that the pair corresponds to a shaded square. From the checkerboard, the shaded squares are:
- (1, 1): \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\)
- (1, 3): \(a = 1\), \(b = 3\)
- (3, 1): \(a = 3\), \(b = 1\)
- (3, 3): \(a = 3\), \(b = 3\)

Thus, there are 4 favorable outcomes.

### Step 6: Calculate the probability
The probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is:
\[

"To find the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the denominator**:
   The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2
   \]

2. **Rewrite the fraction**:
   Using the simplified denominator, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2}
   \]

3. **Separate the fraction**:
   We can separate the fraction into two parts:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{10^7} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
   \]

 4. **Simplify each part**:
   - \(\frac{4321}{10^7}\) is a decimal number where 4321 is placed in the first 7 decimal places:
     \[
     \frac{4321}{10^7} = 0.0004321
     \]
   - \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)

5. **Multiply the two decimals**:
   Now, multiply \(0.0004321\) by \(0.5\):
   \[
   0.0004321 \times 0.5 = 0.00021605
   \]

6. **Sum the digits of the resulting decimal**:
   The decimal \(0.00021605\) has the digits 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Sum these digits:
   \[
   0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14
   \]

 Therefore, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).```python
# Python code to verify the steps and sum the digits

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can simplify the expression as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the original expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\ circ.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
Next, we use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates:

- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) tells us that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This means that for any point \((r, \theta, z)\) on this shape, the \(z\)-coordinate will always be \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(z = c\).

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information and properties of the cross product.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2  + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Substituting the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product, we get:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Simplifying this equation, we find:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we have:

"To solve for the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the properties of the function \( f(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

We need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). To do this, we first need to determine the roots of \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial, and the sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by:
\[ \text{Sum of the roots} = -\frac{b}{a} \]

For \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are:
\[ a = 1, \quad b = -49, \quad c = 623, \quad d = -2015 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
 \[ \text{Sum of the roots of } f(x) = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Next, we consider the transformation \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). This transformation shifts the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), i.e., \( f(x + 5) = 0 \).

If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[ r_1 - 5, \quad r_2 - 5, \quad r_3 - 5 \]

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) \]

This can be simplified as:
\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \ ) is 49, we have:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ \boxed{34} \] 

This solution is derived from the transformation properties of polynomial functions and the sum of the roots. The problem is solved correctly by considering the effect of shifting the roots by a constant. The final answer is \(\boxed{34}\).  \] \] \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\):

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ =  3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot \theta = \tan (90^\circ - \theta)\) to simplify \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\):

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ, \quad \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ, \quad \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

We know from the tangent triple angle identity that \(\tan (3\theta) = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\ ). When \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ = \sqrt{3}\) (a known trigonometric identity). Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ)^2 = 3,
\]
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ \tan^2 50^\circ \tan^2 70^\circ = 3.
\]

Let \(x = \tan^2 10^\circ\), \(y = \tan^2 50^\circ\), and \(z = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Then we have:

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between the sum of interior angles and the number of sides:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for the sum of the interior angles:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all but one interior angle is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, if we let \(x\) be the measure of the missing interior angle, we have:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Relate the sum of the interior angles to the number of sides:**
   Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
    \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

6. **Substitute the range for \(x\):**
   Since \(0 < x < 180^\circ\), we substitute the expression for \(x\):
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
    Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n > 7.9444 \implies n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ

First, expand and simplify the congruence:

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[

\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). To solve this, we use the quadratic formula:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23}
\]

Substitute \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \ ) into the formula:
\[

\[

Recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because if \(\theta = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\), then \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(\tan \theta = x\), so \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Therefore, we can rewrite the original equation as:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

 Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), then \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2
\]

 Rearranging terms gives us a standard quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the solutions to the equation are:

\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}, \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the solutions are:

\[

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by identifying the direction vectors and points on each line. The first line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
and the second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We observe that the direction vector of the second line, \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Specifically, \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This confirms that the lines are parallel .

The distance between two parallel lines can be found by determining the length of the projection of the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line onto the normal vector of the lines. The normal vector of the lines is perpendicular to both direction vectors and can be found by taking the cross product of the direction vectors.

The cross product of \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)) = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) +  \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
In this case, we can use the fact that the lines are parallel and the distance between them is the length of the projection of the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line onto the normal vector. We can use the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) to find the distance.

The distance \(d\) between the two parallel lines is given by the magnitude of the projection of \(\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the normal vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\), which is not possible in this case. Instead, we can use the fact that the distance is the length of the vector component perpendicular to the direction vectors.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly in the interior of the rectangular region with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the boundaries and the interior of the rectangle.

First, let's identify the range of integer \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates that are strictly inside the rectangle. The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\), so the integer \(x\)-coordinates that are strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible \(x\)-coordinates.

Similarly, the \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-4\) and \(4\), so the integer \(y\)-coordinates that are strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us 7 possible \(y\)-coordinates.

The number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly in the interior  of the rectangle is the product of the number of possible \(x\)-coordinates and the number of possible \(y\)-coordinates. Therefore, we calculate:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product:

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b } \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We know from the problem statement that:

\[

\]

Also, the cross product is anti-commutative, so \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these into the expression , we get:

   - Peru: 6 stamps
   - Spain: 13 stamps

2. **Calculate the total number of stamps from the 70's:**

3. **Determine the cost of stamps from each country:**
   - Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
   - France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\) and the height of the trapezoid from \(BC\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of \(\triangle ACD\), which is \(h\).

The area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This implies:
\[
 (a + b)h = 84
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we need to express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). From the equation \((a + b)h = 84\), we can solve for \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b }
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle, and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle BCD\). However, we can directly use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Given the symmetry and the right angle at \(C\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is exactly half of the total area of the trapezoid because the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles and the base \(a\) is part of the total base \(a + b\).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{42}{2} = 21
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\boxed{21}\).\\

   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9

4.  **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

For \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern on the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in a clockwise direction, the points must be in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), or any cyclic permutation of these orders.

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\), because one point can be fixed and the remaining 3 points can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result  in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\), and their cyclic permutations (which are essentially the same arrangements).

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:

\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi

The problem states that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. Each segment is part of a sector of the circle minus the area of a triangle. Since the circles have the same center \(D\) and the radii are 1 and 2, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is the same for both segments. Let's denote this angle by \(\theta\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
 \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta

The area of the isosceles triangle \(ADC\) with angle \(\theta\) at \(D\) and sides of length 2 is:

\[

Thus, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:

\[

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta
\]

The area of the isosceles triangle \(ADC\) with angle \(\theta\) at \(D\) and sides of length 1 is:

\[

\]

Thus, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:

\[
\frac{1}{2 } \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:

\[
2\theta - 2\sin \theta + \frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, we calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \cdot \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)].
\]
Setting \(x = \alpha + \beta\) and \(y = \beta - \alpha\), we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta ) + (\beta - \alpha))].
\]
Simplifying the arguments of the cosines, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)].
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for cosine, \(\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), to find \(\cos 2\alpha\) and \(\cos 2\beta\):
\[
\cos 2\alpha = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68,
\]
\[
\cos 2\beta = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
\]
Substituting these values back into the expression,  we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is \(\boxed{0.09}\).Alternatively, we could have directly evaluated \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5)\) and \(\sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\) using angle sum and difference identities, but the above approach using the product-to-sum identities is more straightforward.

"To convert the bicycle's speed from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from feet per minute to inches per minute.
2. Convert the speed from inches per minute to inches per second.

**Step 1: Convert feet per minute to inches per minute.**

We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, a speed of 20 feet per minute is equivalent to:
\[ 20 \text{ feet/minute} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches/minute} \]

**Step 2: Convert inches per minute to inches per second.**

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so to convert from inches per minute to inches per second, we divide by 60:
\[ 240 \text{ inches/minute} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 4 \text{ inches/second} \]

Thus, the bicycle's speed expressed in inches per second is \(\boxed{4}\).```

First, we are given that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[

\]

Next, we need to find the mean of these three integers. The mean is calculated by:
\[

\]

We are also given that the product of the three integers divided by their mean is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Since \((n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{120}{n} = 24
\]

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by \( n \):
\[
120 = 24n
 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 24:
\[
n = \frac{120}{24} = 5

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression simplifies to:

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties. Let \(AB = AC = x\), \(BC = a\), and \(AM = 11\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude and median, \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so \(BM = MC = \frac{a}{2}\).

First, we use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABM\):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies x^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 \implies x^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4} \implies 4x^2 = 484 + a^2 \implies a^2 = 4x^2 - 484.
\]

Next, we consider the point \(D\) on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\). We need to find the relationship between \(\angle BDC\) and \(\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\),  then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle \(BDC\), we have:
\[
BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BC \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 100}\) and \(CD = \sqrt{AC^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 1}\), we substitute these into the Law of Cosines:
\[
\left(\sqrt{x^2 - 100}\right)^2 = a^2 + \left(\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\right)^2 - 2 \cdot a \cdot \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \cdot \cos(3\theta).

Simplifying, we get:
\[
x^2 - 100 = a^2 + x^2 - 1 - 2a\sqrt{x^2 - 1 } \cos(3\theta) \implies -99 = a^2 - 2a\sqrt{x^2 - 1} \cos(3\theta).

Using the triple angle formula for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), and knowing that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{x}\), we substitute:
\[
\cos(3\theta) = 4\left(\frac{11}{x}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{11}{x}\right) = \frac{4 \cdot 11^3}{x^3} - \frac{33}{x} = \frac{5324 - 33x^2}{x^3}.

Substituting \(\cos(3\theta)\) back into the equation, we get:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer be \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Therefore, the sum is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]

We are given that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7

Since \(27 = 3^3 \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze it in two parts: \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) and \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

### Step 1: Analyze \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)
Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all \(x\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Analyze \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)
We need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\).  Rearranging gives us a quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) for \(0 \leq y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which means \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

### Conclusion
The solution  to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\). In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}
\] 

This interval represents all real values of \(x\) that satisfy the original inequality. The endpoints \(-\sqrt{3}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\) are not included since the inequality is strict (i.e., less than, not less than or equal to). 

We can verify this solution by checking the boundary values:

\[

\]
we aim to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we need to find a way to express \(s\) and \(p\) using the given equations. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(x, y, z\):

t^3 - st^2 + pt - 4 =  0.
\]
The sum of the roots taken one at a time is \(s\), the sum of the roots taken two at a time is \(p\), and the product of the roots is \(4\).

To find \(s\) and \(p\), we can use the second equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12.
\]
Expanding and rearranging gives:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12,
\]
\[
s p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, let's rewrite the numerator and the denominator:
\[ |x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|, \]
\[ x^2 - 36x = x(x-36). \]
So the inequality becomes:
\[ \frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0. \]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Since the absolute value of any real number is non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\), the only way the fraction can be negative is if the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative. Therefore, we need to consider the cases where \(|(x-9)(x+9)| > 0\) and \(x(x-36) < 0\).

The expression \(|(x-9)(x +9)| > 0\) is true for all \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). So we need to solve \(x(x-36) < 0\).

The quadratic inequality \(x(x-36) < 0\) is satisfied when \(x\) is between the roots 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude \(x = 9\) from this interval because it makes the numerator zero, which would not satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[ 0 < x < 36 \text{ and } x \neq 9. \]

In interval notation, the solution is:
\[ (0, 9) \cup (9, 36). \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the given track configuration and use the provided length of the track to find the dimensions of the field.

The track consists of:
1. Two edges of the rectangular field.
2. Two semicircles at the ends of the rectangle.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the rectangle.
- \( W \) as the width of the rectangle.

The two semicircles together form one complete circle with diameter \( W \). Therefore, the circumference of the circle is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two edges of the rectangle and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]

From the track length equation, solve for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( L  \) into the area formula:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W
\]
\[
A = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2}
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, substitute \( W \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{400 - 200}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{200}{2}
\]
\[
L = 100

Finally, calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[
A = L \times W

\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle S\) is a right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

We need to find \(\sin{T}\). Using the property of complementary angles in trigonometry, we know:
\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R}
\]

Next, we need to determine \(\cos{R}\). Recall that:
\[
\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

Simplify the square:
 \[
\frac{4}{25} + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

Subtract \(\frac{4}{25}\) from both sides:
\[
\cos^2{R} = 1 - \frac{4}{25}
\]

Convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
1 = \frac{25}{25}
\]

Subtract the fractions:
\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{25}{25} - \frac{4}{25} = \frac{21}{25}

Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(\cos{R}\):
\[

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

First, substitute \( y \) from the given equation into the distance function:
\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):
\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9

Substitute this back into the distance function:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

D istribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( d \), we minimize \( d^2 \):
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the expression becomes:
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}
\]

This is a quadratic function in \( u \). To find its minimum, we complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola \( au^2 + bu + c \) occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

Here, \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = -2 \):
\[
u  = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
\]

Substitute \( u = 2 \) back into the quadratic function to find the minimum value:
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
d^2 = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}

\[
d^2 = -2 + \frac{9}{2}

\[
d^2 = \frac{-4 + 9}{2}

\[

Thus, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for \( f(x) \) separately.

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**

For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = 3 - x \).

1. Solve \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution. Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. Solve \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution. Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3  \).

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**

For \( x > 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).

1. Solve \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no valid solutions in this case.

2. Solve \( f(x ) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 2 \) is not a valid solution. Therefore, there are no valid solutions in this case.

From the above analysis, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \) and \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \). Therefore, the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) is:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve for the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we need to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. This is a consequence of the symmetry and geometric properties of the octahedron.

Let the vertices of the regular octahedron be \( A, B, C, D, E, F \), and let the distances from \( P \) to these vertices be \( PA = 3, PB = 7, PC = 8, PD = 9, PE = 11, \) and \( PF = x \). According to the property mentioned, the sum of the squares of these distances is constant for any point inside the octahedron. Therefore, we have:

\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 =  9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 324 + x^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, we can denote this constant by \( C \). Therefore, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = C
\]

To find \( C \), we can use the fact that the octahedron is regular and symmetric. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to any of its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any other point inside the octahedron to its vertices. The center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, and this distance is the same as the distance from the center to any vertex, which we can calculate using the properties of the octahedron.

For a regular octahedron with side length \( a \), the distance from the center to any vertex is \( \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2} \). However, we do not need the exact side length to solve this problem. Instead , we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant. Therefore, the constant \( C \) is the same as the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices, which is:

\[
6 \left( \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = 6 \left( \frac{a^2}{2} \right) = 3a^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is the same as the sum of the squares of the distances from any other point inside the octahedron to its vertices, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = 3a^2
\]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( a \) to solve for \( x \). We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, and we have already calculated the sum of the squares of the given distances plus \( x^2 \). Therefore, we can directly solve for \( x \) by setting up the equation:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for force, which is given by:

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball, we can set the force \( F \) equal for both cases. Let's denote the force by \( F \), the mass of the softball by \( m_s \), the mass of the baseball by \( m_b \), the acceleration of the softball by \( a_s \), and the acceleration of the baseball by \( a_b \).

Given:
- Mass of the softball, \( m_s = 200 \) g
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_b = 150 \) g

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball (the softball) to Jack's ball (the baseball), which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \).

First, express the force for both the softball and the baseball using the force formula:

\[ F = m_s \cdot a_s \]
\[ F = m_b \cdot a_b \]

 Since the force \( F \) is the same for both, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]

Now, solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):

\[ a_s = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \cdot a_b \]
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \]

Substitute the given masses into the equation:

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

"Let's denote the cost of one pencil by \( p \) dollars and the cost of one jumbo eraser by \( e \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. Three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost \$1.24:
\[ 3p + e = 1.24 \]

2. Five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost \$1.82:
\[ 5p + e = 1.82 \]

We can eliminate \( e \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2p = 0.58 \]
\[ p = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of one pencil is \$0.29. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To find the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into its decimal form. 

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137}{5 \times 100} = \frac{137}{5} \times \frac{1}{100}
\]

Next, we calculate \(\frac{137}{5}\):
\[
\frac{137}{5} = 27.4
\]

Now, we need to divide 27.4 by 100:
\[
27.4 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.274

Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices. Let's start by analyzing the geometry of the problem.

1. **Identify the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:**
   The locus of points that are equidistant from a point \(O\) and a vertex, say \(A\), is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment \(OA\). Similarly, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). These bisectors will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to one of the vertices than to \(O\).

2. **Determine the shape of the region closer to \(O\):**
   The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is a smaller rectangle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). This smaller rectangle is centered at \(O\) and has half the side lengths of the original rectangle \(ABCD\).

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle:**
    Since the side lengths of the smaller rectangle are half of the side lengths of the original rectangle, its area is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}AB\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}AD\right) = \frac{1}{4} \times AB \times AD = \frac{1}{4} \times AB \times AD\).

4. **Calculate the area of the original rectangle:**
   The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is \(AB \times AD\).

5. **Determine the probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. This is \(\frac{\frac{1}{4} \times AB \times AD}{AB \times AD} = \frac{1}{4}\).

Therefore, the probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).```

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the quotient \(q\) is 9 and the remainder \(r\) is 0. We can verify this by writing the equation:
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]
Here, 0 is the remainder because it satisfies the condition \(0 \leq r < 6\).

"To find \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
- Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 \approx 6.708 \).
 - Since \( 6.708 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

\]

2. **Add the amounts step by step:**

\[

4. **Determine the largest bill that can be used to convert part of the total amount:**

The largest bill that can be used is 100 cents (1 dollar). We will use as many 100-cent bills  as possible until the remaining amount is less than 100 cents.

5. **Calculate the number of 100-cent bills that can be used:**

"To find the class average (mean) on the test, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores:
- There are 20 students who scored 80. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- There are 8 students who scored 90. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- There are 2 students who scored 100. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total sum of the scores:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the magic square with the given values:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We will start by finding the sum of the first row:

\[
S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, we will find the sum of the second row:

\[
S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Since both expressions represent the same sum \( S  \), we set them equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \\
7 = n
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the distance each person walks and then find the difference between these distances. Let's start with Martha's path.

Martha walks along the length and the width of the rectangular field. The total distance Martha walks is the sum of the length and the width of the field:
\[
400 \text{ feet} + 300 \text{ feet} = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Jim walks. Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular field, which forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the length and width of the field as the legs. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(a = 400\) feet and \(b = 300\) feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
c = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2 } = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha walks and the distance Jim walks:
\[
700 \text{ feet} - 500 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\). This can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we use the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\),  which implies \(\omega^2 + \omega = -1\). We can rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), the denominator simplifies to \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = 1.

Thus, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\). This value is the same regardless of which of the non-real cube roots of unity we choose for \(\omega\), because the properties","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
