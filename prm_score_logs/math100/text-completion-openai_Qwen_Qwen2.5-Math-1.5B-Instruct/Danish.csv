"To solve for \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(D\):
   - \(EF\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\).
   - \(DF\) is the hypotenuse.
   - \(DE\) is the adjacent side to angle \(D\).

2. Use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF}
   \]
   Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the equation:
   \[
   0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
   \]

3. Solve for the hypotenuse \(DF\):
   \[
   DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\):
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^ 2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
   \]
   \[
   100 = DE^2 + 49
   \]
   \[
   DE^2 = 100 - 49
   \]
   \[
   DE^2 = 51
   \]
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).```

"To find the result \( w \) when \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) is rotated by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c = 2 - 3i \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the real and imaginary parts separately:
   \[
   z' = (2 - 2 + \sqrt{2}) + (- (3 + 3 \sqrt{2}) + 3)i
   \]
    \[
   z' = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):
   \[
   e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   Use the distributive property :
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - i \frac{6}{2} - 3 \cdot \frac{2}{2} i^2
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   z'' = 4 - 2i
   \]

5. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the real and imaginary parts separately:
    \[
   w = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i
   \]
   \[
   w = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}

```python
def find_w(z, c, angle):
    # Translate z so that c is at the origin
    z_prime = z - c

    rotation = cmath.exp(1j * angle)
    z_double_prime = z_prime * rotation
    
    # Translate back to the original coordinate system
    w = z_double_prime + c
    return w

# Given values
z = 2 + math.sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 * math.sqrt(2)) * 1j
c = 2 - 3j
angle = math.pi / 4

The output of the code will be:

"To find the value of \(\sqrt{242}\), we will simplify the expression step by step.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   First, we need to find the prime factorization of 242.
   - 242 is even, so it is divisible by 2:
     \[
     242 \div 2 = 121
     \]
     So, \(242 = 2 \times 121\).
   - Next, we factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square:
     \[
     121 = 11 \times 11
     \]
     So, \(121 = 11^2\).

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11^2
   \]

2. **Simplify the Square Root:**
   Using the prime factorization, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}
   \]
    We can separate the square root into the product of the square roots:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{11^2} = 11\), we have:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}
   \]

Therefore, the value of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).```

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single block**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a table is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" around a table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) ways.

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around  the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k 
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

To find the constant term, we need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5 \cdot 3}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
 \]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = -\frac{1000}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -125
\]

Thus, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).```

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\).

First, we calculate each term in the expression modulo 7:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 7k + 2 + 2 \equiv 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 7k + 2 + 4 \equiv 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 7k + 2 + 6 \equiv 7k + 8 \equiv 7k + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}. \]

Now we substitute these values back into the expression:
\[ (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}. \]
 We can simplify this step by step:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24, \]
\[ 24 \equiv 24 - 3 \cdot 7 = 24 - 21 = 3 \pmod{7}, \]
\[ 3 \cdot 1 = 3. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry and the smallest number of degrees a figure must be rotated to return to its original position. A figure with rotational symmetry has a certain angle of rotation that will bring it back to its original position. For a figure to have rotational symmetry of order 5 (which means it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \)), the smallest angle of rotation that will return the figure to its original position is \( 72^\circ \).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the order of rotational symmetry: The problem states that the figure roteres mod 5 (which means it has rotational symmetry of order 5).
2. Calculate the smallest angle of rotation: For a figure with rotational symmetry of order 5, the smallest angle of rotation is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\) with the condition \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\). The midpoint of \(AC\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]
The midpoint of \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)

Since the midpoints are the same,  we can set up the following equations:

\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[

However, we have \(x = 6\), which does not satisfy the condition \(x > 7\). This indicates that we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the condition. Given that \(x > 7\), we need to consider the possibility that the coordinates we calculated might need a different approach or re-evaluation of the problem setup.

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points.

First, factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 \]

We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \). We can factor this quadratic as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

So, the denominator is zero when:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the roots:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2  \]

### Step 2: Find the Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.

Consider the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the denominator:
- The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
- The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the Asymptotes
We have:
- Vertical asymptotes at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \)
- Horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \)

The values are:
\[ a = 7, \quad b = -2, \quad c = 0 \]

Now, calculate \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \ begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[ \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0. \]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}. \]
So the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest  eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \( C = 4 \).

We need to find the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we note that since \(z^5 = 1\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{z} = z^4\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\), we can isolate \(z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3\) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\) is:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and find the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9  = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]

So, \(36_{10}\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

 Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\). Sub stituting this identity into the numerator, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many treeks are equivalent to one goolee in terms of weight.

Let's break down the information given:
1. One treek and one goolee together weigh the same as two treeks.
2. One treek and one goolee together weigh the same as one squig.

Let's define the weights of the treek, goolee, and squig as follows:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ T + G = 2T \]
By simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ G = T \]
This tells us that one goolee weighs the same as one treek.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ T + G = S \]
Since we already know that \( G = T \), we can substitute \( T \) for \( G \) in the equation:
\[ T + T = S \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2T = S \ ]
This tells us that one squig weighs the same as two treeks.

The problem asks how many treeks are equivalent to one squig. From the equation \( S = 2T \), we can see that one squig weighs the same as two treeks.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\). This means that one squig weighs the same as two treeks. The step-by-step reasoning is as follows:

1. We start by defining the weights of the treek, goolee, and squig.
2. From the first piece of information, we know that one treek and one goolee together weigh the same as two treeks. This gives us the equation \( T + G = 2T \).
3. Simplifying this equation, we find that \( G = T \), which means one goolee weighs the same as one treek.
4. From the second piece of information, we know that one treek and one goolee together weigh the same as one squig. This gives us the equation \( T + G = S \).

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and match coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2 
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by matching coefficients:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12t^4 = 12t^4\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

First, solve for \(a\) using the constant term equation:

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^2\) term equation:

\[
-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8
\]
\[
-6 + 5b - 12 = -8
\]
\[
5b - 18 = -8
\]
\[
5b = 10
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

 Finally, verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) with the \(t^3\) and \(t\) term equations:

For the \(t^3\) term:

\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3(2) + 20 = 26
\]
\[
6 + 20 = 26
\]
\[
26 = 26 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

For the \(t\) term:

\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16
\]
\[
-10 - 6 = -16
\]
\[
-16 = -16 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

Both equations are satisfied. Therefore, the values are correct. The sum \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know the volume of the tank after it has been filled is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, and the height of the tank is 4 meters. Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

To find the radius \( r \), we take the square root of both sides:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the piecewise function \(f(x)\) intersects every non vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function at the boundary \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we need to ensure that the function is continuous at \(x = a\). For continuity, the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\).

The left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a^2 + 2a.
\]

The right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim _{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a^3.
\]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three solutions:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.
\]

Since \(a\) is a positive constant, we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\). Therefore, the only positive solution is \(a = 2\).

Next, we need to verify that with \(a = 2\), the function \(f(x)\) intersects every non vertical line at least once. The function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if  } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to check if the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every line \(y = c\) for any real number \(c\). For \(x \geq 2\), \(f(x) = 2x^2\) is a parabola opening upwards, and for \(x < 2\), \(f(x) = 2x + 4\) is a linear function with a positive slope. 

- For \(x < 2\), \(f(x) = 2x + 4\) can take any value in the range \((-\infty, 8)\).
- For \(x \geq 2\), \(f(x) = 2x^2\) can take any value in the range \([8, \infty)\).

Since the function \(f(x)\) covers all values from \((-\infty, 8)\) and \([8, \infty)\), it covers all real numbers. Therefore, the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every non vertical line at least once.

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the given equation.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get 25. So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
 To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, and then square it to get 9. So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1.  Therefore, we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\):
\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \]
To eliminate the square root, we square both sides:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \). This simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda\), which is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x  + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has solutions in \((0,1)\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), we need to ensure that the equation has roots in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) and the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\), we can determine that for \(\lambda \in (1, 4]\), there exist values of \(x\) in \((0,1)\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) is the mind smallest positive value for the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression inside the tangent function. The given expression is:

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator and the denominator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b\) and the sine addition formula \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b \).

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = (\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, let's simplify the  denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = (\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to :
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) is the smallest positive value. Notice that \(\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ\) are both positive for the given angles.

\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). We calculate each term until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5 } \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Adding these together, the total number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]
Therefore, the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, if \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \cos \phi \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sin \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sin \phi \), and the function becomes:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \cos \phi) = \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi). \]
The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for some integer \(  k \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

To verify, we can check specific values. For example, if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), then:
\[ f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1. \]
Similarly, if \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \), then:
\[ f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1. \]
These values confirm that the maximum value of the function is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), and then take half of that magnitude. The area of triangle \(OAB\) is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\|
\]

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The vectors are \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\  1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component, we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
 \]

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that this is the form of the golden ratio \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and its conjugate \(\overline{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\). The equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \) implies that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4 }}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}. \]
However, we can simplify this by recognizing that the roots are \( z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( z = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which are \(\phi\) and \(\overline{\phi}\) respectively.

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = \phi \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \overline{\phi} \), and vice versa. We know that \(\phi\) and \(\overline{\phi}\) satisfy the equation \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\) and \(\overline{\phi}^2 = \overline{\phi} + 1\). This implies that \(\phi^n + \overline{\phi}^n\) is an integer for any integer \( n  \). Specifically, we need to find the integer value of \( \phi^{85} + \overline{\phi}^{85} \).

The sequence \( a_n = \phi^n + \overline{\phi}^n \) satisfies the recurrence relation \( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \) with initial conditions \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = 1 \). This is the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted by one index. Therefore, \( a_n = F_{n+1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. Thus, \( \phi^{85} + \overline{\phi}^{85} = F_{86} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of medians and the concept of similar triangles. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the properties of the centroid and the medians:**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Use the fact that \(G\) is the centroid:**
   Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that the segments \(AG\), \(BG\), and \(CG\) are \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) respectively.

3. **Identify the similar triangles:**
   Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AGM\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their heights. Since \(MN\)  is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AGM\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGM\):**
   The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its sides. Since the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AGM\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\), the ratio of their areas is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) is \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

5. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGN\):**
   Similarly, since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore,  the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AGN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\). So, the area of triangle \(AGN\) is also \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

6. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGM\) and \(AGN\) combined:**
   Since \(G\) is the centroid, the area of triangle \(AGM\) and triangle \(AGN\) together is the area of triangle \(AGM\) plus the area of triangle \(AGN\), which is \(\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

7. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGM\) and \(AGN\) combined:**
   The area of triangle \(AGM\) and triangle \(AGN\) combined is \(\frac{2}{9} \times 144 = 32\).

Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) and triangle \(AGN\) combined is \(\boxed{32}\).```

3. Since we don't know \(n\) or \(d\) directly, we need to find the middle term.

Each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. The numbers 1, 3, and 5 are odd, and the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are even. When rolling two dice, there are a total of \(6 \times 6 = 36\) possible outcomes.

We can categorize these outcomes based on whether the sum of the numbers is odd or even. The sum of two numbers is odd if one number is odd and the other is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are odd or both numbers are even.

Let's count the number of outcomes where the sum is odd. There are 3 odd numbers and 3 even numbers on each die. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the first die shows an odd number and the second die shows an even number is \(3 \times 3 = 9\). Similarly, the number of outcomes where the first die shows an even number and the second die shows an odd number is also \(3 \times 3 = 9\). So, the total number of outcomes where the  sum is odd is \(9 + 9 = 18\).

Now, let's count the number of outcomes where the sum is even. The number of outcomes where both dice show odd numbers is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

"To determine the smallest positive multiple of 450 that has no trailing zeros, we need to understand the prime factorization of 450 and the conditions for a number to have no trailing zeros.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number has trailing zeros if it has factors of 10, and each 10 is composed of a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Therefore, to have no trailing zeros, a multiple of 450 must not have enough factors of 2 or 5 to form a 10.

Since 450 already has one factor of 2 and two factors of 5, we need to find the smallest number that, when multiplied by 450, will not provide an additional factor of 2 or 5. The smallest such number is 2, because multiplying by 2 will provide an additional factor of 2, but not an additional factor of 5.

Let's calculate this:

Now, let's check if 90 0 has any trailing zeros. The prime factorization of 900 is:
\[ 900 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

Since 900 has two factors of 2 and two factors of 5, it has at least one factor of 10, which means it has trailing zeros.

To ensure we have no trailing zeros, we need to find the next smallest number that, when multiplied by 450, will not provide an additional factor of 2 or 5. The next smallest number is 5, because multiplying by 5 will provide an additional factor of 5, but not an additional factor of 2.

Let's calculate this:
\[ 450 \times 5 = 2250 \]

Now, let's check if 2250 has any trailing zeros. The prime factorization of 2250 is:
\[ 2250 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^3 \]

Since 2250 has one factor of 2 and three factors of 5, it has one factor of 10, which means it has one trailing zero.

 To ensure we have no trailing zeros, we need to find the next smallest number that, when multiplied by 450, will not provide an additional factor of 2 or 5. The next smallest number is 9, because multiplying by 9 will provide an additional factor of 3, but not an additional factor of 2 or 5.

Let's calculate this:
\[ 450 \times 9 = 4050 \]

Now, let's check if 4050 has any trailing zeros. The prime factorization of 4050 is:
\[ 4050 = 2 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \]

Since 4050 has one factor of 2 and two factors of 5, it does not have any factors of 10, which means it has no trailing zeros.

Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 that has no trailing zeros is:
\[ \boxed{4050} \]```

"To solve the problem, we need to find a number that satisfies two conditions:
1. When divided by 4, the remainder is 1, 2, or 3.
2. When divided by 5, the remainder is 1, 2, or 3.

Let's denote the number we are looking for by \( x \).

### Step 1: Analyze the first condition
The first condition can be written as:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \]

This means that \( x \) can be expressed in the form:
\[ x = 4k + r \]
where \( r \) is one of the remainders: 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, \( x \) can be:
\[ x = 4k + 1 \]
\[ x = 4k + 2 \]
\[ x = 4k + 3 \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second condition
The second condition can be written as:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x  \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]

This means that \( x \) can be expressed in the form:
\[ x = 5m + s \]
where \( s \) is one of the remainders: 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, \( x \) can be:
\[ x = 5m + 1 \]
\[ x = 5m + 2 \]
\[ x = 5m + 3 \]

### Step 3: Find a common solution
We need to find a number \( x \) that satisfies both sets of conditions. Let's consider each case for \( x \) modulo 4 and check which of these values also satisfies the second condition modulo 5.

#### Case 1: \( x = 4k + 1 \)
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \]
Since 4 and 5 are coprime, \( k \) must be a multiple of 5 :
\[ k = 5n \]
\[ x = 4(5n) + 1 = 20n + 1 \]

#### Case 2: \( x = 4k + 2 \)
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \]
Since 4 and 5 are coprime, \( k \) must be a multiple of 5:
\[ k = 5n \]
\[ x = 4(5n) + 2 = 20n + 2 \]

#### Case 3: \( x = 4k + 3 \)
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k + 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 4k \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \]
Since 4 and 5 are coprime, \( k \) must be a multiple of 5:
\[ k = 5n \]
\[ x = 4(5n) +  3 = 20n + 3 \]

### Step 4: Combine the solutions
From the above cases, we see that \( x \) can be:
\[ x = 20n + 1, \quad x = 20n + 2, \quad x = 20n + 3 \]

The smallest positive integer that satisfies all these conditions is when \( n = 0 \):
\[ x = 1, \quad x = 2, \quad x = 3 \]

However, we need to find the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies both conditions. The next smallest positive integer is:
\[ x = 23 \]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
Let's verify that \( x = 23 \) satisfies both conditions:
1. \( 23 \div 4 = 5 \) remainder \( 3 \)
2. \( 23 \div 5 = 4 \) remainder \( 3 \)

Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies both conditions is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]```

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we start by simplifying the fraction. The denominator can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we perform the division to convert the fraction into a decimal. We divide 4321 by 20000000:

\[
4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605
\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is  0.00021605. Now, we sum the digits of this decimal number. The digits are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14
\]

Thus, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).```

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[

\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
 (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the angles \(20^\circ, 40^\circ, 60^\circ, 80^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

This identity can be derived using complex numbers or symmetry properties of the sine function. Therefore, we have:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{256}.

"To determine the form of the surface described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates, we need to understand the structure of cylindrical coordinates and the meaning of the equation given.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:

- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

To visualize this, imagine a flat sheet of paper that extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions but is fixed at a constant height \( z = c \) above the \( xy \)-plane. This flat sheet is a plane, and it is the surface described by the equation \( z = c \).

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

We know that:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Substituting the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we get:

"To determine the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). By Vieta's formulas, we know that for a cubic polynomial \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \), the sum of the roots taken one at a time is equal to \(-a\). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is 49.

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \)  are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( y = x + 5 \), then \( x = y - 5 \), and so \( f(y) = 0 \) implies \( y = r_1, r_2, r_3 \), and thus \( x = r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is therefore:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\). This allows us to express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of cosines:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta\) again to see that  \(\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), but these are already in the form we need.

Now, let's use the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\). Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70 ^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result from trigonometric sum identities, which states that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 3.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 3 = 6.

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180 to isolate \( n-2 \):

\[

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[

Performing the division:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula for \( ax^2 + bx + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is given by:

\[ x \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{p} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}  \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( k \) such that:

\[ k^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( k \) from 1 to 22 to find a solution:

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
 \[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( k \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( k \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two potential solutions for \( t \):

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

We need to check which of these values satisfy the original congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):

For \( t = 4 \):

\[ 4(4 + 2) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23 } \]

For \( t = 17 \):

\[ 17(17 + 2) = 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Both values satisfy the original congruence. However, we are asked to find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \). Both 4 and 17 are valid solutions within this range, but we need to determine if there is a unique solution.

"To solve for \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find \( f(5) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:

\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
\]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at 6. The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

\[
g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

 Therefore, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is \(\boxed{7}\).```

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by understanding the properties of the inverse trigonometric functions involved.

First, recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because \(\cot^{-1} y = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)\), and substituting \(y = \frac{1}{x}\) gives \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right).
\]
Now, let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\sin (2\theta ) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We know that \(\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), we have \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{ b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:
\[
\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}.
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}\).```
```After solving the problem, we can conclude that the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}\).","[{3 - 2*sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2) + 3}, '3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}']",3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by identifying the direction vectors and points on each line. The first line is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The second line is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We observe that the direction vector of the second line, \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Specifically, \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This confirms that the lines are parallel.

 To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines given by:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left\| \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \mathbf{d} \right\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|}
\]

where \(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\) is the vector from a point on the first line to a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can choose \(P_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(P_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) as points on the first and second lines, respectively. Then, \(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8  \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). We need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot (-2) - 5 \cdot (-9)) - \mathbf{j}((-8) \cdot (-2) - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}((-8) \cdot (-9) - 7 \cdot 2)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf {i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of this vector is:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \mathbf{d} \right\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is:

\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the two lines is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7 
\]

So, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).```

\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
 \]

We are given \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\).

\[

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

1. **Identify the given information and properties:**
   - \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\)
   - \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\)
   - \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\)
   - Area of trapezoid \(ABCD = 42\)

2. **Label the trapezoid and its properties:**
   - Let \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), and \(DA = d\).
   - Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
   - \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), so \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\).

3. **Use the area of the trapezoid:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}

   Let the height from \(C\) to \(AB\) be \(h\). Then:

   \]
   \[
   84 = (AD + BC) \times h

4. **Use the right triangle properties:**
   Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Let \(AC = x\). Then:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD =  \frac{1}{2} \times x \times c
   \]

5. **Relate \(x\) and \(h\) using the properties of the trapezoid:**
   Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the angle bisector theorem in \(\triangle ABD\). However, we need to find a more direct relationship. Notice that the height \(h\) can be expressed in terms of \(x\) and the segments of \(AD\) and \(BC\).

6. **Use the area of \(\triangle ACD\) directly:**
   We need to find \(x\) and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times c
   \]
   Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a fraction of the area of the trapezoid. However, without loss of generality, we can use the fact that the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles formed by the diagonal \(AC\ ).

7. **Final calculation:**
   Since the total area of the trapezoid is 42 and the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles, we can directly use the area relationship:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of trapezoid} = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[

   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:

"To determine the condition under which the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect within a circle, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

1. **Identify the Circle and Points**: The points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of a circle. We need to find a condition that guarantees that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect within the circle.

2. **Use the concept of chords and their intersections**: Two chords of a circle intersect inside the circle if and only if the endpoints of one chord are separated by the endpoints of the other chord when traverse the circle. In other words, if we can traverse the circle in such a way that we encounter the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in an alternating manner (i.e., \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\)), then the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect inside the circle.

3. **Formulate the Condition **: The condition that ensures the intersection of \(AB\) and \(CD\) within the circle is that the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that they form a cyclic quadrilateral where the diagonals intersect inside the circle. This is equivalent to saying that the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are in such a position that one pair of opposite sides of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) are chords of the circle that intersect inside the circle.

Therefore, the condition for the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect within the circle is that the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are in such a position that one pair of opposite sides of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) are chords of the circle that intersect inside the circle. This can be stated as:

\[

"Given two circles with centers at \( D \) and radii \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) respectively, we are to find the measure of \( \angle ADC \) such that the combined area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the smaller circle:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The problem states that the area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of this region is:
\[
\text{Area of the region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

This area can also be expressed as  the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle:
\[
\text{Area of the region} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]

However, the problem states that the area of the region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), which means there is a discrepancy. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the angle \( \angle ADC \).

Let \( \theta \) be the measure of \( \angle ADC \) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \( \theta \) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \( \theta \) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
\]

The area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle that corresponds to the angle \( \theta \) is:
\ [
\text{Area of the region} = 2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta
\]

We know this area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Solving for \( \theta \):
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]

Since \( \theta \) is in radians, we need to convert it to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{9} = 200^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of \( \angle ADC \) is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\] degrees. However, this is the larger angle. The smaller angle is:
\[
360^\circ - 200^\circ = 160^\circ

"To determine how many bledde (8 cm high) bottles of water are needed to fill a spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volume of both the tank and one bottle of water and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one bottle.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in the value, we get:
\[ V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one bledde bottle. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the bledde bottle,  the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{bledde}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bledde bottles are required to fill the tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one bledde bottle:
\[ \text{Number of bledde bottles} = \frac{V_{\text{tank}}}{V_{\text{bledde}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of bledde bottles needed to fill the spherical tank is:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

Let \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta \), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}  + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha +  \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}
\]
Using the difference of squares formula, we get:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 21 - 12 = 9
\]
So the product is:
\[
\frac{9}{100} = 0.09

"Let's denote the three numbers as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, the product of these three numbers is 120, so we have:
\[abc = 120.\]

The problem also states that the average of these three numbers is 24. The average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3, so we have:
\[\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24.\]
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
\[a + b + c = 72.\]

We need to find the largest of the three numbers, assuming they are ordered such that \(a \leq b \leq c\). To do this, we will consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations.

First, let's express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) using the product equation:
\[c = \frac{120}{ab}.\]
Substituting this into the sum equation gives:
\[a + b + \frac{120}{ab} = 72.\]
Multiplying through by \(ab\)  to clear the fraction gives:
\[a^2b + ab^2 + 120 = 72ab.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[a^2b + ab^2 - 72ab + 120 = 0.\]
Factoring out \(ab\) from the first three terms gives:
\[ab(a + b - 72) + 120 = 0.\]

To find suitable values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can test possible integer values for \(a\) and \(b\) that are factors of 120. Let's start with the largest possible value for \(a\) and check if we can find corresponding values for \(b\) and \(c\).

If \(a = 5\), then:
\[5bc = 120 \implies bc = 24.\]
We also have:
\[5 + b + c = 72 \implies b + c = 67.\]
We need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their product is 24 and their sum is 67. However, there are no such pairs of integers.

 Next, let's try \(a = 4\):
\[4bc = 120 \implies bc = 30.\]
We also have:
\[4 + b + c = 72 \implies b + c = 68.\]
We need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their product is 30 and their sum is 68. Again, there are no such pairs of integers.

Next, let's try \(a = 3\):
\[3bc = 120 \implies bc = 40.\]
We also have:
\[3 + b + c = 72 \implies b + c = 69.\]
We need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their product is 40 and their sum is 69. Again, there are no such pairs of integers.

Next, let's try \(a = 2\):
\[2bc = 120 \implies bc = 60.\]
We also have:
\[2 + b + c = 72 \implies b + c = 70.\]
We need to find two numbers \(b\) and  \(c\) such that their product is 60 and their sum is 70. Again, there are no such pairs of integers.

Finally, let's try \(a = 1\):
\[1bc = 120 \implies bc = 120.\]
We also have:
\[1 + b + c = 72 \implies b + c = 71.\]
We need to find two numbers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their product is 120 and their sum is 71. The pair \(b = 30\) and \(c = 41\) satisfies both conditions:

\[

Next, we eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

Calculating \(16^3\), we get:

So the equation now is:

\[

\]

To solve for \(x-2\), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root gives us both the positive and the negative roots:

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( AM \) is the median, \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then, \( BC = 2x \).

Using the Apollonius's theorem (or the median length formula) for \( \triangle ABC \):
\[

Since \( AB = AC \), let \( AB = AC = y \). Substituting the known values:

\[

\[
121 = y^2 - x^2

where \( R_{ABD} \) is the circumradius of \( \triangle ABD \). Since \( \angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2} \) (as \( D \) is on the median and \( \angle BAC = \theta \)), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = 2R_{ABD}
\]
Since \( BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{y^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{y^2 - 100} \), we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{y^2 - 100}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = 2R_{ABD}
\]

We need to find the relationship between \( R_{ABD} \) and \( R_{BDC} \). Since \( D \) is on the median, we use the fact that the circumradius of a triangle is related to its sides and angles. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the circumradius of \( \triangle ABC \) is the same as the circumradius of \( \triangle  BDC \) because \( M \) is the midpoint and the median is also the altitude in this isosceles triangle.

Thus, we have:
\[
R = \frac{x}{\sin 3\theta}
\]

Using the identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \), and knowing that \( y^2 = x^2 + 121 \), we can find \( x \) and \( \theta \) such that the circumradius \( R \) is consistent with the given conditions. After solving, we find:
\[
R = 11
\]

Therefore, the circumradius of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]```

The final answer is $\boxed{11}$. This solution involves using the properties of isosceles triangles, the Law of Sines, and the median length formula. It requires careful application of geometric principles and trigonometric identities to find the circumradius of the triangle.

"To determine the median of the numbers from 1 to 27, we first need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the element in the middle. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

In this problem, we are given the numbers from 1 to 27. Since 27 is an odd number, the list of numbers from 1 to 27 has 27 elements. The median will be the 14th number in this sorted list.

To find the 14th number in the list from 1 to 27, we simply note that the list is simply the sequence of positive integers from 1 to 27. Therefore, the 14th number in this list is 14.

Thus, the median of the numbers from 1 to 27 is \(\boxed{14}\).```

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) for real values of \(x\), we will break it into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \]

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative (as they are even powers of \(x\)), the smallest value \(x^4 + 4x^2\) can take is 0 (when \(x = 0\)). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\) because \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) and \(-4\) is less than 0.

So, the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[ (-\infty, \infty) \]

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

 Next, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

To solve this, we can make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}  \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

The roots are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(x^2\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be factored as:
\[ (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the interval where \(y\) is between the roots, but since \(y = x^2\) is always non-negative, we only consider \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Thus, \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\).

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality:
 \[ 0 \leq x < \sqrt{3} \quad \text{or} \quad -\sqrt{3} < x \leq 0 \]

Combining these intervals, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

Since the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is all real numbers, and the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\), the intersection of these two solutions is:
\[ (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \]

Thus, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[ \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})} \]```r

"Given the equations:

\[

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum identity:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z)  = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Thus:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine the total percentage of bus passengers for each class, we need to consider the percentage of each class of passengers in each bus stop and the number of buses passing through each bus stop. The total percentage of bus passengers is the weighted average of the percentages of each class of passengers, where the weights are the number of buses passing through each bus stop.

Let's denote the number of buses passing through the \(9^{\text{th}}\) bus stop as \(B_9\), the \(10^{\text{th}}\) bus stop as \(B_{10}\), the \(11^{\text{th}}\) bus stop as \(B_{11}\), and the \(12^{\text{th}}\) bus stop as \(B_{12}\). The total number of passengers is 300 for each class.

The total percentage of bus passengers for each class is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Total percentage} = \frac{(B_9 \times 41.1\%) + (B_{10} \times 34.4\%) + (B_{11} \times 20.6\%) + (B_{12} \ times 11.6\%)}{B_9 + B_{10} + B_{11} + B_{12}}
\]

Since the total number of passengers is 300 in each class, the total number of passengers for the entire bus stop is \(300 + 300 = 600\). The total percentage of bus passengers is the total number of passengers divided by the total number of passengers, multiplied by 100:
\[
\text{Total percentage} = \left( \frac{300 + 300}{600} \right) \times 100 = 100\%
\]

However, we need to find the percentage of bus passengers that are from the students, which is the sum of the percentages of students in each bus stop:
\[
\text{Percentage of students} = \frac{(B_9 \times 41.1\%) + (B_{10} \times 34.4\%) + (B_{11} \times 20.6\%) + (B_{12} \times 11.6\%)}{B_ 9 + B_{10} + B_{11} + B_{12}}
\]

We know that the total number of passengers is 600, so the total percentage of bus passengers is 100%. The percentage of students is the sum of the percentages of students in each bus stop, which is:
\[
\text{Percentage of students} = \frac{41.1\% + 34.4\% + 20.6\% + 11.6\%}{4} = \frac{107.7\%}{4} = 26.925\%

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. The absolute value in the numerator can be handled by considering the expression inside the absolute value. The expression \(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as \(x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The denominator can also be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). So the inequality is:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine where the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative. The expression will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs.  The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, so the expression will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. This happens when \(x\) and \(x-36\) have opposite signs. We can analyze this by considering the critical points where the expression changes sign, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the expression is negative:

1. For \(x < 0\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product is positive.
2. For \(0 < x < 36\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product is negative.
3. For \(x > 36\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product is positive.

Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative for \(0 < x < 36\). We also need to check the points where the expression is undefined, which are \(x = 0 \) and \(x = 36\). Since the expression is undefined at these points, they are not included in the solution set.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 36)}

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangle within the given constraints, we need to analyze the shape and dimensions provided in the problem. The shape consists of a rectangle with two half-circles on its sides, and the total perimeter of the shape is 400 meters.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). The width \( W \) is also the diameter of each half-circle. Therefore, the radius of each half-circle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total perimeter of the shape includes the two lengths of the rectangle, the two widths of the rectangle, and the circumferences of the two half-circles. The circumference of one full circle is \( 2\pi r \), so the circumference of one half-circle is \( \pi r \). Since there are two half-circles, their combined circumference is \( 2 \times \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \pi W \).

Thus, the total perimeter of the shape is:
\[ 2L + 2W + \pi W = 400 \]
\[ 2L + (2 + \pi)W = 400 \]
 \[ 2L = 400 - (2 + \pi)W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi)W}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) from the perimeter equation:
\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{(2 + \pi)W}{2}\right)W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{(2 + \pi)W^2}{2} \]

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of \( W \) that maximizes this quadratic function. The area \( A \) is a quadratic function in terms of \( W \), and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( W^2 \) is negative), so the maximum value occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\frac{2 + \pi}{2} \) and \( b = 200  \), so:
\[ W = -\frac{200}{2 \times -\frac{2 + \pi}{2}} = \frac{200}{2 + \pi} \]

Substituting this value of \( W \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi) \times \frac{200}{2 + \pi}}{2} = 200 - \frac{200}{2} = 100 \]

Now, we can calculate the maximum area:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{2 + \pi} = \frac{20000}{2 + \pi} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[ 2 + \pi \approx 5.14 \]
\[ A \approx \frac{20000}{5.14} \approx 3885.54 \]

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\), \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are the acute angles in the triangle. We need to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
\[
\angle R + \angle S + \angle T = 180^\circ
\]
Given that \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]
Thus, \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\).

Next, we use the trigonometric identity for the sine of a complementary angle:
\[
\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos{\theta}
 \]
Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \sin(90^\circ - \angle R) = \cos{\angle R}
\]

We need to find \(\cos{\angle R}\). We know:
\[
\sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} = 1
\]
Substituting \(\theta = \angle R\):
\[
\sin^2{\angle R} + \cos^2{\angle R} = 1
\]
Given \(\sin{\angle R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we have:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cos^2{\angle R} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{4}{25} + \cos^2{\angle R} = 1
\]
\[
\cos^2{\angle R} = 1 - \frac{4}{25}
\]
\[
\cos^2{\angle R} = \frac{25}{25} - \frac{4}{25}
\]
\[
\cos^2{\angle R} = \frac{21}{25}
 \]
Taking the positive square root (since \(\cos{\angle R}\) is positive in the first quadrant):
\[
\cos{\angle R} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus:

"To find the distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and the point on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we need to minimize the distance function. The distance \(d\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph is given by:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \ ]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9} \]

To minimize \(d\), we need to minimize the expression \(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9\). Let \(u = x^2\), then the expression becomes \(u^2 - 4u + 9\). We can find the minimum value of this quadratic expression by completing the square or using the vertex formula. The expression \(u^2 - 4u + 9\) can be rewritten as:

\[ u^2 - 4u + 9 = (u-2)^2 + 5 \]

The minimum value of \((u-2)^2 + 5\) is 5, which occurs when \(u = 2\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9\) is 5 , and the minimum value of \(d\) is:

\[ d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), and we can identify \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), we have:
   \[
   f^{-1}(0) = 3
   \]

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x \):
    \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Multiply by \(-1\):
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factorize:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = -1 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we have no valid solutions in this range.

Thus, the only valid solution for \( f^{-1}(0) \) is:
\[
f^{-1}(0) = 3
\]

 ### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), we have:
   \[
   f^{-1}(6) = -3
   \]

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x

   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the center of the pyramid, we first need to identify the coordinates of point \( P \) and the center of the base of the pyramid.

The base of the pyramid is a square with vertices at \((1,0,0)\), \((-1,0,0)\), \((0,1,0)\), and \((0,-1,0)\). The center of this square base is the average of the coordinates of these vertices:
\[
\left( \frac{1 + (-1) + 0 + 0}{4}, \frac{0 + 0 + 1 + (-1)}{4}, \frac{0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{4} \right) = (0, 0, 0).
\]
However, the center of the pyramid is actually the same as the center of the base because the base is centered at the origin and the apex is directly above the center. So, the center of the pyramid is \((0,0,0)\).

Now, we need to find the distance from point \( P = (1.2, 1.5, 1) \) to the origin  \((0,0,0)\). This distance is given by the Euclidean distance formula in three dimensions:
\[
\sqrt{(1.2 - 0)^2 + (1.5 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1.2^2 + 1.5^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1.44 + 2.25 + 1} = \sqrt{4.69} = \sqrt{\frac{469}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{469}}{10}.

"To solve this problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or \( F = m \cdot a \).

Given:
- The force (F) required to k acid the softball is the same as the force required to k acid the baseball.
- The mass of the softball is 200 grams.
- The mass of the baseball is 150 grams.
- We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball.

Let's denote:
- The acceleration of the softball as \( a_s \)
- The acceleration of the baseball as \( a_b \)

According to Newton's second law, the force required to k acid the softball is:
\[ F = 200 \text{ g} \cdot a_s \]

And the force required to k acid the baseball is:
\[ F = 150 \text{ g} \cdot a_b \]

Since the forces are the same, we can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 200 \text{ g} \cdot a_s = 150 \text{ g} \cdot a_b  \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we can solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To convert the decimal number \(629_{10}\) to base 7 and base 8, we will use the method of successive division by the base and recording the remainders.

### Converting \(629_{10}\) to base 7

1. Divide 629 by 7:
   \[
   629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 6.

2. Divide 89 by 7:
   \[
   89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
   \]
   So, the next digit is 5.

3. Divide 12 by 7:
   \[
   12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
   \]
   So, the next digit is 5.

4. Divide 1 by 7:
   \[
   1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]
   So, the most significant  digit (leftmost) is 1.

   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 5.

2. Divide 78 by 8:
   \[
   78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
   \]
   So, the next digit is 6.

3. Divide 9 by 8:
   \[
   9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]
   So, the next digit is 1.

4. Divide 1 by 8:

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial and the polynomial evaluated at \( x = 1 \).

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is given by \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \), which is equal to \( f(0) \) because \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) implies \( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \).

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the given polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \).

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The formula is:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). We do this by subtracting \(2x\) from both sides:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1 )^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).```

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions as \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively:
\[
A = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
B = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
C = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

From Vieta's formulas,  we know that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
A + B + C = 0.
\]

Additionally, we have:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.

From Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
so:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\ alpha_4 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = -A.
\]
Thus:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -A.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = x\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = y\), so \(x + y = -2\). Therefore:
\[
xy = -A.
\]

We also know from Vieta's formulas that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
which can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0,
\ ]
or:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 y + \alpha_3\alpha_4 x = 0.

Since \(x + y = -2\), we can substitute \(y = -2 - x\) into the equation:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(-2 - x) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 x = 0,
\]
or:
\[
-2\alpha_1\alpha_2 - x\alpha_1\alpha_2 + x\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
or:
\[
x(\alpha_3\alpha_4 - \alpha_1\alpha_2) = 2\alpha_1\alpha_2.
\]
Since \(xy = -A\), we have \(x(-2 - x) = -A\), or \(x^2 + 2x - A = 0\). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4A}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + A}.

"To determine the cost of one blyant, we need to add the costs of one blyant from each of the two individuals and then find the total cost of one blyant from each.

First, let's denote the cost of one blyant as \( B \) and the cost of one jumbo from the first person as \( J_1 \). Similarly, let the cost of one jumbo from the second person be \( J_2 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ J_1 + B = 1.24 \]
\[ J_2 + B = 1.82 \]

We need to find the value of \( B \). To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (J_2 + B) - (J_1 + B) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ J_2 - J_1 = 0.58 \]

This tells us that the difference in the cost of the j稅 between the two individuals is \$0.58. However, to find the cost of one blyant, we need to isolate \( B \). We can do this by adding the two equations  together:
\[ (J_1 + B) + (J_2 + B) = 1.24 + 1.82 \]
\[ J_1 + J_2 + 2B = 3.06 \]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for \( B \):
\[ 2B = 3.06 - (J_1 + J_2) \]

Since we know that \( J_1 + B = 1.24 \) and \( J_2 + B = 1.82 \), we can express \( J_1 \) and \( J_2 \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ J_1 = 1.24 - B \]
\[ J_2 = 1.82 - B \]

Substituting these into the equation for \( 2B \):
\[ 2B = 3.06 - ((1.24 - B) + (1.82 - B)) \]
\[ 2B = 3.06 - (1.24 + 1.82 - B - B) \]
\[ 2B = 3.06 -  3.06 + 2B \]
\[ 2B = 3.06 - 3.06 \]
\[ 2B = 0.58 \]
\[ B = 0.29 \]

Therefore, the cost of one blyant is \$0.29. Since the problem asks for the cost of one blyant in cents, we convert \$0.29 to cents:
\[ 0.29 \times 100 = 29 \]

So, the cost of one blyant is:

"To determine the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the fraction if possible**: In this case, the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) is already in its simplest form because 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1.

2. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**: To convert \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Alternatively, we can find an equivalent fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10.

3. **Find an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 1000**: Since 500 is \(5 \times 100\), we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get a denominator of 1000:
   \[
   \frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000 }
   \]
   Now, \(\frac{274}{1000}\) can be written as the decimal 0.274.

4. **Verify the conversion**: To ensure the conversion is correct, we can perform the division \(137 \div 500\) directly:
   \[
   137 \div 500 = 0.274
   \]
   This confirms that the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is 0.274.

Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{0.274}\).```

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which the point \(P\) is equidistant from the center \(O\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) and the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Let's start by setting up the coordinate system for the rectangle.

Assume the rectangle \(ABCD\) is positioned in the coordinate plane with the center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the coordinates of the vertices be:
- \(A = (a, b)\)
- \(B = (-a, b)\)
- \(C = (-a, -b)\)
- \(D = (a, -b)\)

The point \(P\) is inside the rectangle and is equidistant from all four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). This means that \(P\) must be the center of the rectangle, which is the origin \(O\).

To verify this, we calculate the distance from \(P\) to each vertex. Let \(P = (x, y)\). The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is:
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 +  (y - b)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(B\) is:
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(C\) is:
\[
PC = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(D\) is:
\[
PD = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

For \(P\) to be equidistant from all four vertices, we must have:
\[
PA = PB = PC = PD
\]

This implies that:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

 Squaring both sides of each equation, we get:
\[
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Simplifying these equations, we get:
\[
(x - a)^2 = (x + a)^2 \implies x^2 - 2ax + a^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 \implies -4ax = 0 \implies x = 0
\]
\[
(y - b)^2 = (y + b)^2 \implies y^2 - 2by + b^2 = y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -4by = 0 \implies y = 0
\]

Thus, the only solution is \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\), which means \(P \) must be at the origin \(O\).

Now, we need to find the condition on \(AB/AD = k\) for \(P\) to be the center of the rectangle. The lengths of the sides are:
\[
AB = 2a \quad \text{and} \quad AD = 2b
\]
Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k
\]

For \(P\) to be the center, the rectangle must be a square, meaning \(a = b\). Therefore, \(k = 1\).

Thus, the condition for \(P\) to be tautly at \(O\) is:
\[
\boxed{k = 1}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{k = 1}\). This means that for the point \(P\) to be equidistant from all four vertices of the rectangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides \(AB/AD\) must be 1, indicating that the rectangle must be a square.```

This division is exact, meaning the quotient \(q\) is 9 and the remainder \(r\) is 0. Therefore, we can write:

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]

From this equation, we see that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In other words, \(54 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}\).

Thus, the value of bestem resten af 54 modulo 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).将是

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047197 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047197 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function:  \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).```

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and决 internatgetDoctrineer gik til deres nollag er deres penge Summer i cent mindre end deres totalvize for at vizeim med money, we will follow these steps:

1. **Sum the total amount of money given by each person:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   -决 internat lekker: \$26.52

   First, we add the dollars together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

"To find the average score of the class, we need to determine the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores for each group of students:
- 20 students each scored 80, so the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students each scored 90, so the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students each scored 100, so the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Next, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the entire class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals of a 3x3 magic square is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
\]
Since this is a magic square, the sum of the second column must also be \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
 \[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We can verify that the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal is indeed \( 15 \):
- Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15  \)
- Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

"To determine how much closer Jim is to Martha than she is to the opposite corner of the rectangle, we need to calculate the distances Jim and Martha each travel and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's label the corners of the rectangle as follows:
- Let \( A \) be the starting point of Jim.
- Let \( B \) be the opposite corner where Martha is initially.
- Let \( C \) be the point where Jim stops after traveling diagonally.

The rectangle has dimensions 300 metres by 400 metres. Therefore, the lengths of the sides are:
- Length \( AB = 400 \) metres
- Width \( AD = 300 \) metres

Jim travels diagonally from \( A \) to \( C \). To find the length of the diagonal \( AC \), we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ metres}
\ ]

Martha, on the other hand, travels along the perimeter of the rectangle to reach the point where Jim stops. To find the distance Martha travels, we need to consider the path she takes. Since Martha is at the same point as Jim after Jim has traveled diagonally, we can consider the path she takes as follows:
- First, she travels along the length of the rectangle to reach point \( D \), which is 300 metres.
- Then, she travels along the width of the rectangle to reach point \( C \), which is 400 metres.

Thus, the total distance Martha travels is:
\[
AD + DC = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ metres}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances Jim and Martha travel:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ metres}
\]

Therefore, Jim is \(\boxed{200}\) metres closer to Martha than she is to the opposite corner of the rectangle.```

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 = 1\). These solutions are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the fact that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2  = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To determine the shortest distance that a person can travel to visit all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once and return to the starting point, we need to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

The given points and distances are:
- \(D\) to \(B\): 3 units
- \(A\) to \(B\): 5 units
- \(A\) to \(C\): 6 units
- \(D\) to \(C\): 4 units
- \(A\) to \(D\): 5 units
- \(B\) to \(C\): 6 units

We will consider all possible Hamiltonian cycles and calculate their total distances.

1. **Cycle \(D \to B \to C \to A \to D\):**
   - \(D \to B = 3\)
   - \(B \to C = 6\)
   - \(C \to A = 6\)
   - \(A \to D = 5\)
   - Total distance: \(3 + 6 + 6 +  5 = 20\)

2. **Cycle \(D \to B \to A \to C \to D\):**
   - \(D \to B = 3\)
   - \(B \to A = 5\)
   - \(A \to C = 6\)
   - \(C \to D = 4\)
   - Total distance: \(3 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 18\)

3. **Cycle \(D \to C \to A \to B \to D\):**
   - \(D \to C = 4\)
   - \(C \to A = 6\)
   - \(A \to B = 5\)
   - \(B \to D = 3\)
   - Total distance: \(4 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 18\)

4. **Cycle \(D \to C \to B \to A \to D\):**
   - \(D \to C = 4\)
   - \(C \to B = 6\)
   - \(B \to A = 5\)
   - \(A \to D =  5\)
   - Total distance: \(4 + 6 + 5 + 5 = 20\)

5. ** Cycle \(A \to D \to B \to C \to A\):**
   - \(A \to D = 5\)
   - \(D \to B = 3\)
   - \(B \to C = 6\)
   - \(C \to A = 6\)
   - Total distance: \(5 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 20\)

6. **Cycle \(A \to D \to C \to B \to A\):**
   - \(A \to D = 5\)
   - \(D \to C = 4\)
   - \(C \to B = 6\)
   - \(B \to A = 5\)
   - Total distance: \(5 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 20\)

From the calculations, the shortest cycle is \(D \to B \to A \to C \to D\) and \(D \to C \to A \to B \to D\), both with a total distance of 18  units.

Therefore, the shortest distance that a person can travel to visit all four points exactly once and return to the starting point is \(\boxed{18}\).``````
