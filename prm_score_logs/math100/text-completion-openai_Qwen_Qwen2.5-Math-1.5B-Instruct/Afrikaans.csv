"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

The triangle \(DEF\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(F\). We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve the equation for \(DE\):
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = \frac{7}{\frac{7}{10}} = 7 \times \frac{10}{7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"To find \( w \), we need to determine the result of subtracting \( c \) from \( z \) and then rotating the result by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \).

First, let's express \( z \) and \( c \) in a more convenient form:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \]
\[ z - c = 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i \]
\[ z - c = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i \]
\[ z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Now, we need to rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4}  \) radians counterclockwise. To do this, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \), where \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, let's express \( z - c \) in polar form. The magnitude \( r \) of \( z - c \) is:
\[ r = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

The argument \( \theta \) of \( z - c \) is:
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \tan^{-1}(-3) \]

So, in polar form, \( z - c \) is:
\[ z - c = 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(\tan^{-1}(-3)) + i\sin(\tan^{-1}(-3 )) \right) \]

Now, we multiply this by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
\[ w = 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}) \right) \]

Using the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
\[ \cos(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}) = \cos(\tan^{-1}(-3))\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) - \sin(\tan^{-1}(-3))\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \]
\[ \sin(\tan^{-1}(-3) + \frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(\tan^{-1}(-3))\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \cos(\tan^{-1}(-3))\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \]

Since \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we have:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of the number 242. We do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we are left with 1.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number):
\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. So, we check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 (1 + 2 + 1 = 4) is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check divisibility by 5, but 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. The next prime number is 7, and 121 divided by 7 is not an integer. We then check divisibility by 11:
 \[121 \div 11 = 11\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}\]

Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this as:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplify each part of the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

 \[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k} x^{-2k}
\]

Simplify the exponent of \(x\):

\[
x^{15-3k} x^{-2k} = x^{15-3k-2k} = x^{15-5k}
\]

So the general term becomes:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
 15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
x^{15-5(3)} = x^0 = 1
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125 The final answer is  \boxed{-125} \]","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To solve the problem of determining the value of \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) modulo 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\) into the expression \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\).
2. Simplify each term in the expression modulo 7.
3. Calculate the product of the simplified terms modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:

Since \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we have:
\[ n+2 \equiv 2+2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n+4 \equiv 2+4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n+6 \equiv 2+6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now, substitute these values back into the expression \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\):
\[ (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7 } \]

Next, we calculate the product:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]
\[ 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \] (since \(24 - 3 \cdot 7 = 24 - 21 = 3\))
\[ 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \]

Given the context, we need to interpret the statement in a way that makes logical sense.

The statement ""n mâle on sy met posisie saamval"" implies that we need to find the minimum number of grades (which could be points, levels, or any other unit of measurement) that need to be added or distributed to satisfy a condition related to ""sy"" and ""posisie saamval"" (sy and together to make the statement true).

Without additional context, the most straightforward interpretation is that we need to find the minimum number of grades that need to be added to make the statement true.

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints are the same:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6  \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be a mistake. Let's recheck the coordinates of the fourth vertex by considering the vector approach. The vector \(\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)\) should be equal to the vector \(\overrightarrow{DC} = (7-x, 4-y)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
7 - x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 4 - y = 5
\]

Solving these equations:
\[
x = 6 \quad \text{(which is not possible since \(x > 7\))}
\]
\[
y = -1 \quad \text{(which is not possible since we need to find a valid \(x > 7\))}
\]

 Rechecking the coordinates, we realize that the correct approach should be:
\[
x = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y = -1
\]

Thus, the correct coordinates for the fourth vertex are \((8, -1)\), and the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
8 + (-1) = 7
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{7}\).```

"为了找到函数 \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) 的垂直和水平渐近线，我们需要遵循以下步骤：

1. **确定垂直渐近线：**
   垂直渐近线出现在分母为零的地方，而分子不为零。因此，我们首先找到分母的根：
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0

   我们可以将这个二次方程因式分解：
   \[
   (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0

   因此，解为 \( x = 7 \) 和 \( x = -2 \)。这些是垂直渐近线，所以我们有 \( a = 7 \) 和 \( b = -2 \)。

2. **确定水平渐近线：**
   水平渐近线由函数在 \( x \) 趋向于无穷大时的极限决定。对于有理函数 \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \)，其中 \( P(x) \) 和 \( Q(x) \)  是多项式，我们查看 \( P(x) \) 和 \( Q(x) \) 的次数：
   - 如果 \( P(x) \) 的次数小于 \( Q(x) \) 的次数，水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。
   - 如果 \( P(x) \) 的次数等于 \( Q(x) \) 的次数，水平渐近线是 \( y \) 的最高次系数的比值。
   - 如果 \( P(x) \) 的次数大于 \( Q(x) \) 的次数，没有水平渐近线（相反，存在斜渐近线）。

   在这个例子中，分子的次数是 1，分母的次数是 2。由于分子的次数小于分母的次数，水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。因此，\( c = 0 \)。

3. **计算 \( a + b + c \)：**

This means we need to find the operator norm of the matrix \( A \), which is the largest singular value of \( A \).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\]

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10}  = 36_{10}\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9
To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
 \]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many squigs are equivalent to one treek. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know from the problem that three squigs are equal to one goolee:

   \]

2. We also know that two treeks are equal to one goolee:
   \[

3. Since one goolee is equal to three squigs, we can substitute this into the second equation:
   \[

4. To find out how many squigs are equivalent to one treek, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

 \[

\[

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12

2. The coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[

Solving for \(b\):
\[
3b = 6 \implies b = 2

3. The coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8

Substituting \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

"We need to determine the radius of a cylindrical tank given that it is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per minute and that the height of the water increases at a rate of 4 meters per minute.

First, let's recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is given by the derivative of the volume with respect to time \(t\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]
We know that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) cubic meters per minute and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) meters per minute. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]
Next, we solve for \(r^2\)  by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ 5 = r^2 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]
Therefore, the radius of the tank is \(\sqrt{5}\) meters. The answer is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is horizontally one-dimensional at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior at the point where the definition of the function changes, i.e., at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For the graph to be horizontally one-dimensional at least once, the function must have a break or a jump discontinuity at \(x = a\). This means that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) must not be equal.

First, let's find the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a .
\]

Next, let's find the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

For the function to have a jump discontinuity at \(x = a\), these two limits must be different:
\[
a^3 \neq a^2 + 2a.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \neq 0.
\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \neq 0.
\]
This can be further factored as:
\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) \neq 0.
\]

The solutions to the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Therefore, for the function to have a jump  discontinuity, \(a\) cannot be 0, 2, or -1. The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this condition is \(a = 2\).

However, since we are asked for the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph is horizontally one-dimensional at least once, we need to consider the behavior of the function for positive values of \(a\). The value \(a = 2\) is the largest positive value that satisfies the condition.

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) is:
\[
\boxed{2}.

The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).```EDT

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the given circle has a radius of 1, we start by rewriting the equation of the circle in standard form. The given equation is:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

We need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms. For the \( x \)-terms, we have:

\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

For the \( y \)-terms, we have:

\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Simplifying, we obtain:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c  \]

The standard form of the equation of a circle is:

\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

Here, the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by:

\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the radius of the circle is 1, so:

\[ r = 1 \]

Therefore:

\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]

Setting the two expressions for \( r^2 \) equal to each other, we get:

\[ c = 34 - 1 = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}  \le 1.\]
This inequality is always true for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)  = 1.\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find a specific \(\lambda\) that works, let's test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\):

Setting \(f(f(x)) = x\), we get:
\[4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x.\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we know that \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos(A +  B)\) and \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin(A + B)\). We can rewrite the expression using these identities:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can also use the angle addition formulas. Notice that:

\[
\sin  5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\ The final answer is  \(\theta = 45^\circ\). \(\theta = 45^\circ\).

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \(42!\). Typically, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of times 10 is a factor is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

To find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\), we use the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by examining the function and its properties.

First, we note that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric with respect to the variables \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that we might consider the case when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]

Next, we need to find the maximum value of the function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2 } + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

We evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, let's write down the vectors:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1  & b_2 & b_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \begin{vmatrix} a_2 & a_3 \\ b_2 & b_3 \end{vmatrix} - \mathbf{j} \begin{vmatrix} a_1 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_3 \end{vmatrix} + \mathbf{k} \begin{vmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\ b_1 & b_2 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the values of \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \mathbf{j} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 &  1 \end{vmatrix} + \mathbf{k} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, we compute the 2x2 determinants:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8

\[

So, the cross product is:

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we start with the given equation:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

This can be rewritten using Euler's formula as:

\[
2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Solving for \(\cos \theta\), we get:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}
\]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[
z^{85} = (e^{i\theta})^{85} = e^{i85\ theta}
\]

Thus,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2 \cos(85\theta)
\]

We need to determine \(\cos(85\theta)\). Recall that \(\cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\). We will use the angle addition formulas for cosine to find \(\cos(85\theta)\). However, a more efficient approach is to recognize that \( z \) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) are roots of a specific polynomial.

Given \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can form a quadratic equation:

\[
z^2 - \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)z + 1 = 0
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Then the quadratic equation becomes:

\[
z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0
\]

The roots  of this equation are:

\[
z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2}
\]

Since \(\alpha^2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\), we have:

\[
\alpha^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}
\]

However, these roots are not simple to handle directly. Instead, we use the fact that \( z \) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) are powers of a complex number. We know that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation The final answer is :

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of medians and the centroid of a triangle, as well as the fact that the area of a triangle formed by joining the centroid and two sides of the original triangle is one-sixth of the area of the original triangle.

Given:
- The area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144.
- \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) are medians of triangle \(ABC\) and they intersect at the centroid \(G\).
- \(MN\) is a line segment parallel to \(BC\) and passing through \(G\), intersecting \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\).

We need to find the area of triangle \( GMN \).

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through \(G\), triangle \(GMN\) is similar to triangle \(GBC\) (by AA similarity, as \(MN \ parallel BC\) implies corresponding angles are equal, and both triangles share angle \(G\)).

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians. Since \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(GMN\) to triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(GMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(GBC\).

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(GBC\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides triangle \(ABC\) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, so the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48 
\]

Now, the area of triangle \(GMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(GBC\):
\[
\frac{4}{9} \times 48 = \frac{192}{9} = \frac{64}{3}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(GMN\) is \(\boxed{\frac{64}{3}}\).```

"To find the sixtieth term of the arithmetic sequence where the tenth term is 200 and the eightieth term is 500, we can follow these steps:

1. Recall the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

2. Use the information given to set up two equations. For the tenth term:
   \[
   a_{10} = a_1 + 9d = 200
   \]
   For the eightieth term:
   \[
   a_{80} = a_1 + 79d = 500
   \]

3. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(a_1\):
   \[
   (a_1 + 79d) - (a_1 + 9d) = 500 - 200
   \]
   Simplifying this,  we get:
   \[
   70d = 300
   \]
   Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   d = \frac{300}{70} = \frac{30}{7}
   \]

4. Substitute \(d = \frac{30}{7}\) back into the equation for the tenth term to find \(a_1\):
   \[
   a_1 + 9 \left(\frac{30}{7}\right) = 200
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   a_1 + \frac{270}{7} = 200
   \]
   Convert 200 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:
   \[
   a_1 + \frac{270}{7} = \frac{1400}{7}
   \]
   Subtract \(\frac{270}{7}\) from both sides:
   \[
   a_1 = \frac{1400}{7} - \frac{270}{7} = \frac{1130}{7}
   \]

 5. Now, find the sixtieth term using the formula for the \(n\)-th term:
   \[
   a_{60} = a_1 + 59d = \frac{1130}{7} + 59 \left(\frac{30}{7}\right)

   Simplify the expression:

"To solve the problem of finding how many perfect squares are between 100 and 150, we need to identify the smallest and largest integers whose squares fall within this range.

First, we find the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to 100. We do this by taking the square root of 100:
\[
\sqrt{100} = 10
\]
So, the smallest integer is 10, and \(10^2 = 100\).

Next, we find the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 150. We do this by taking the square root of 150:
\[
\sqrt{150} \approx 12.247
\]
So, the largest integer is 12, and \(12^2 = 144\).

Now, we need to count all the perfect squares from \(10^2\) to \(12^2\). These perfect squares are:
\[
10^2 = 100, \quad 11^2 = 121, \quad 12^2 = 144

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{450}\).","[450, '450']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to find a number that satisfies the conditions given. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - The first number \( N \) when divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1, 2, or 3. This means \( N \equiv 1, 2, \text{or } 3 \pmod{4} \).
   - The second number \( N \) when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means \( N \equiv 1, 2, 3, \text{or } 4 \pmod{5} \).

2. **Finding a Number that Satisfies Both Conditions:**
   - We need to find a number \( N \) that satisfies both conditions. Let's list the numbers that satisfy each condition:
     - For \( N \equiv 1, 2, \text{or } 3 \pmod{4} \), the numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, ...
     - For  \( N \equiv 1, 2, 3, \text{or } 4 \pmod{5} \), the numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, ...

   - The common numbers in both lists are: 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, ...

3. **Finding the Smallest Positive Solution:**
   - The smallest positive number that satisfies both conditions is 1. However, we need to find the smallest positive number that is greater than 1 and satisfies both conditions. The next number in the list is 6.

4. **Verifying the Solution:**
   - Let's verify that 6 satisfies both conditions:
     - \( 6 \div 4 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2 \) (satisfies \( N \equiv 1, 2, \text{or } 3 \pmod{4} \))
     - \( 6 \div 5 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \) (satisfies \( N \ equiv 1, 2, 3, \text{or } 4 \pmod{5} \))

   - Both conditions are satisfied by \( N = 6 \).

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The total number of possible remainders when dividing by 4 and 5 are 4 and 5 respectively.
   - The total number of possible remainders when dividing by both 4 and 5 simultaneously is the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20.
   - The number of favorable outcomes is 6 (as verified by the step-by-step list).

   - Therefore, the probability that the number satisfies both conditions is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}
     \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \frac{3}{10} } \).```

"To determine the last non-zero digit of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the Fraction
First, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\).

Since \(4321\) is not divisible by either \(5\) or \(2\) (as it is an odd number and does not end in \(0\)), the fraction is already in its simplest form.

### Step 2: Convert to a Decimal
To find the last non-zero digit, we can convert the fraction to a decimal. However, this is not necessary for our purpose. Instead, we will directly work with the fraction.

### Step 3: Determine the Power of 10
We need to find the highest power of \(10\) that divides the denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\).

The number of trailing zeros in a number is determined by the number of times \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\) divides the number. Here, we have:
- \(5^7\)  contributes \(7\) factors of \(5\).
- \(2^8\) contributes \(8\) factors of \(2\).

The limiting factor is the number of \(5\)s, which is \(7\). Therefore, the highest power of \(10\) that divides the denominator is \(10^7\).

### Step 4: Simplify the Fraction by the Highest Power of 10
We divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(10^7\):
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{(5^7 \cdot 2^7) \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

### Step 5: Convert to a Decimal
Now, we convert \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) to a decimal:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000 } = 0.00021605
\]

### Step 6: Identify the Last Non-Zero Digit
The last non-zero digit of the decimal \(0.00021605\) is \(5\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{5}\).```

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rearrange and group the terms as follows :

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]

This can be written as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\ circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\), and \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\). So, we rewrite the expression as:

\[
(\cos^2 70^\circ) (\cos^2 50^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos^2 10^\circ).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) again, we have \(\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\), \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\cos 10^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ).

"To determine which geometric shape the equation \( z = c \) describes in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what each coordinate represents:

- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) specifies that the \( z \)-coordinate is a constant \( c \). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the height \( z \) is always the same. Therefore, the points \((r, \theta, c)\) form a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane at height \( z = c \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a flat, infinite plane that extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, but is fixed at a constant \( z \)-coordinate. This is essentially a horizontal plane that cuts through the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the geometric shape described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by the formula:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7\). Also, we are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\ ). Substituting these values into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we get:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Simplifying this equation, we find:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). The smallest angle between two vectors is the one that is less than or equal to \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the smallest angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

The polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \) is a cubic polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient.

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles.

First, let's rewrite the expression in terms of trigonometric identities:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). So the expression becomes:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x \), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ  + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\), so \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ\). Using the identity \(\tan x \cdot \cot x = 1\), we can use the fact that \(\tan^2 x + \cot^2 x = \tan^2 x + \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific combination of angles, which is a known trigonometric identity:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ = 3.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 3 = 9.

2. Set up the equation based on the given information.
3. Solve for the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.
4. Determine the number of Sye sou-dot compound units based on the number of sides.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:
\[ (n-2) \times 180^\circ \]

We are given that this sum is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To solve for \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[ n-2 = 5.9444 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6 . Therefore:
\[ n = 6 + 2 \]
\[ n = 8 \]

First, let's expand and rearrange the congruence:

\[

\]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can rewrite it in standard form:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}

We will use the quadratic formula to solve this congruence. The quadratic formula for \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is given by:

\[

Simplify inside the square root:

\[

\]

\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23}

Next, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}

We can test values to find \( x \):

\[

\[

\[
10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}

Thus, \( x \equiv 10 \) or \( x \equiv -10 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \).

1. **Find the side length of the cube**: The volume of a cube is given by the formula \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \implies s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot}

2. **Calculate the surface area**: The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula \( A = 6s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Since we have determined that \( s = 1 \) foot, we can substitute this value into the formula:

3. **Convert the surface area to square meters**: Since 1 foot is approximately 0.3048 meters, we can convert the side length to meters:
   \[
   s = 1  \text{ foot} = 0.3048 \text{ meters}

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we first recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 1\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

Substituting the values \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 2002 \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 4004 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 4005 \]

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

First, let's evaluate \( f(5) \). The function \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \), so we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
\]

Next, we subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) = x + 1 \), so we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to understand the relationship between the inverse trigonometric functions involved.

First, let's denote:
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}(x) \]
This means that:
\[ \tan(\theta) = x \]
and \(\theta\) is the angle whose tangent is \(x\).

Next, let's consider:
\[ \phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \]
This means that:
\[ \cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x} \]
and \(\phi\) is the angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\).

We know that \(\cot(\phi) = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \phi\right)\), so:
\[ \frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \phi\right) \]
This implies:
\[ \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right ) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \phi \]
Thus, we have:
\[ \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \]

Now, we substitute \(\phi\) back into the original equation:
\[ \sin \left( \theta + \phi \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) \right) \]
Simplifying the argument of the sine function:
\[ \sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) \]
Using the identity \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha\right) = \cos(\alpha)\), we get:
\[ \sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) +  \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \cos \left( \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) \]

We know that:
\[ \cos \left( \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{1}{3} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ \frac{x^2}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{9} \]
Multiplying both sides by \(9(1+x^2)\), we obtain:
\[ 9x^2 = 1 + x^2 \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 8x^2 = 1 \]
So:
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{8} \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we have:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel and then use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space.

The parametric equations of the lines are:
\[ \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \]

We observe that the direction vector of the second line is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line:
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
This confirms that the lines are parallel.

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we need a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors.  This vector can be found using the cross product of the direction vectors. The direction vectors are:
\[ \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \]

The cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2\) is:
\[ \mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)) \]
\[ = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8)  + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{i}(0) - \mathbf{j}(0) + \mathbf{k}(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \]

This indicates that the direction vectors are not linearly independent, which is expected because they are parallel. Instead, we need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) to form this vector:
\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \]

"We start with the given vertices of a rectangle: \( (5, 4) \), \( (-5, 4) \), \( (-5, -4) \), and \( (5, -4) \).

First, we need to determine the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The horizontal sides are given by the coordinates with the same \( y \)-values. The length of these sides is:
\[
5 - (-5) = 10
\]

The vertical sides are given by the coordinates with the same \( x \)-values. The length of these sides is:
\[
4 - (-4) = 8
\]

Next, we need to find the number of points with integer coordinates that lie on the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of the rectangle consists of four line segments. We will consider each segment separately.

1. **Horizontal segment on the line \( y = 4 \)**:
    - The x-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\).
    - Integer x-coordinates in this range are \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\).
     - Number of integer points: \(11\).

2. **Horizontal segment on the line \( y = -4 \)**:
    - The x-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\).
    - Integer x-coordinates in this range are \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\).
    - Number of integer points: \(11\).

3. **Vertical segment on the line \( x = 5 \)**:
    - The y-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).
    - Integer y-coordinates in this range are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
    - Number of integer points: \(9\).

4. **Vertical segment on the line \( x = -5 \)**:
    - The y-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).
    - Integer y-coordinates in this range are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
     - Number of integer points: \(9\).

Now, we sum the number of integer points on all four segments:
\[
11 + 11 + 9 + 9 = 40
\]

However, we must exclude the four corners of the rectangle, as they are counted twice (once for each segment they belong to). Each corner is counted once in the horizontal and one in the vertical, so we subtract 4 from the total:
\[
40 - 4 = 36
\]

Thus, the number of points with integer coordinates that lie on the perimeter of the rectangle is:

"To solve for \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression expands as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

 Using the properties of the cross product, \(\mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 3 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}  = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

1. **Understand the given conditions and draw the trapezium:**
   - \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \) means \(ABCD\) is a trapezium.
   - \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \) means \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
   - \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \) means \( \angle BAC = \angle CAD \).

2. **Use the angle bisector property:**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), we can use the angle bisector theorem. Let \( \angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta \ ). Therefore, \( \angle BAD = 2\theta \).

3. **Calculate the area of trapezium \(ABCD\):**
   The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is given by:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h

6. **Calculate the area of \( \triangle ABC \):**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \overline{CD} \) is the base, we need to find the length of \(AC\) and use it to find the area of \( \triangle ABC \). However, we can use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) can also be expressed in terms of the height and the base, but we need to find a relationship between the areas.

First, calculate the product of the numerators and the fraction:
\[

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we can simplify it to:

   - The area of the sector in the smaller circle is \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \pi r^2\).

6. **Equate the areas:**
   - The area of the slices in the cake is \(\frac{5}{12} \pi R^2\).
   - The area of the sector in the smaller circle is \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \pi r^2\).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \pi r^2 = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2\).

7. **Solve for \( \angle ADC \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} r^2  = \frac{5}{12} R^2\).
   - Multiply both sides by 360: \(\angle ADC \cdot r^2 = 150 R^2\).
   - Divide both sides by \( r^2 \): \(\angle ADC = \frac{150 R^2}{r^2}\).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the problem does not provide the exact ratio of the radii \( R \) and \( r \), we assume that the slices are directly proportional to the area of the smaller circle.
   - Given that the total area of the slices is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the larger circle, the angle \( \angle ADC \) must be \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total angle in the smaller circle.
   - Therefore, \(\angle ADC = \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ\).

Thus, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is \(\boxed{150}\).```

"To find out how much water to fill a sphere with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Here, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in the value of the radius, we get:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( 6^3 \):

\[ 6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216 \]

So the volume becomes:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 \]

Next, we simplify the expression:

\[ V = \frac{4 \times 216}{3} \pi = \frac{864}{3} \pi = 288 \pi \]

Therefore, the volume of the sphere is:

\[ V = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We already know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity  \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the formulas for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
 \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt The final answer is  \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",True
"We need to determine the speed of the train in the number of steps per meter. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - The train travels 20 steps per minute.
   - We need to find out how many steps the train takes per meter.

2. **Determine the time it takes for one step**:
   - Since the train travels 20 steps per minute, the time taken for one step is:
     \[
     \text{Time per step} = \frac{1 \text{ minute}}{20 \text{ steps}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ minutes per step}
     \]

3. **Convert the time per step into seconds**:
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
     \[
     \text{Time per step in seconds} = \frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ steps}} = 3 \text{ seconds per step}
     \]

4. **Convert the time per step into meters**:
   - We need to know the speed of the train in meters per second. Let's assume the train travels at a constant speed  of \(v\) meters per second. The distance the train travels in one step is the speed multiplied by the time per step:
     \[
     \text{Distance per step} = v \times 3 \text{ seconds per step}
     \]
   - Since the train travels 20 steps per minute, the total distance traveled in one minute is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance in one minute} = 20 \times \text{distance per step} = 20 \times (v \times 3) = 60v \text{ meters per minute}
     \]
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the speed of the train in meters per second is:
     \[
     v = \frac{60v \text{ meters}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = v \text{ meters per second}
     \]
   - This confirms our speed calculation. Now, we need to find the speed in steps per meter. Since the train travels 20 steps per minute and the distance traveled in one minute is \(60v\) meters, the speed in steps per meter is:
     \[
     \text{Speed in steps per meter } = \frac{20 \text{ steps}}{60v \text{ meters}} = \frac{20}{60v} = \frac{1}{3v}
     \]
   - Since \(v = 1 \text{ meter per second}\), the speed in steps per meter is:
     \[
     \text{Speed in steps per meter} = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ steps per meter}
     \]

Therefore, the speed of the train in steps per meter is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

First, we know the product of these three numbers is 120:

\]

Next, we know the quotient when their product is divided by their mean is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{\text{mean}} = 24
\]

The mean of the three numbers is:
\[
\text{mean} = \frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can rewrite the quotient equation as:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24

This simplifies further to:
\[

Solving for \(  n^2 \):

"We start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]
First, we recognize that the expression inside the cube root can be simplified. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]
To eliminate the cube root, we cube both sides of the equation:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 16^3
\]
Next, we calculate \(16^3\):
\[
16^3 = 4096
\]
So the equation now is:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]
To solve for \(x - 2\), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that the square root of a number can be positive or negative:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
 \]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]
Solving these two equations for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62

So the final answer is:

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

To do this, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in a geometric progression. Specifically, for \(n = 4\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

This  identity can be derived using properties of roots of unity and the polynomial whose roots are the cosines of these angles. For completeness, we can also verify this by considering the polynomial whose roots are \(\cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\), which is a factor of the 15th cyclotomic polynomial, and then using the fact that the product of the roots of a polynomial is given by the constant term (with appropriate sign).

Given this identity, we have:

\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

We need to solve this inequality step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the inequality for \( x^4 + 4x^2 \):**

   Consider the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \). Since \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are both non-negative for all real values of \( x \), their sum \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is also non-negative. Thus, we have:

   \[ x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \]

2. **Simplify the left part of the inequality:**

   For the left part of the inequality:

   \[ -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \]

   Since \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \), this inequality is always true for all real numbers \( x \). Therefore, the left part of the inequality does not provide any restrictions on \( x \).

3. **Simplify the right part of the inequality:**

   For the right part of the inequality:

    \[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

   To find the values of \( x \) that satisfy this inequality, we need to solve:

   \[ x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0 \]

   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:

   \[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

4. **Solve the quadratic inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \):**

   First, solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \):

   \[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]

   \[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]

   \[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]

   \[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

   This gives us the roots:

    \[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
   \[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

   Since \( y = x^2 \), and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard \( y = -7 \) as it is not valid.

   Thus, we have:

   \[ y = 3 \]

   The quadratic \( y^2 + 4y - 21 \) can be factored as:

   \[ (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 \]

   This inequality holds for:

   \[ -7 < y < 3 \]

   Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we consider only:

   \[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

5. **Convert back to \( x \):**

   Since \( y = x^2 \), we have:

Next, we need to express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\). We use the identity:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p),
\]
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also have the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
x(y^2 + z^2) + y(x^2 + z^2) + z(x^2 + y^2) = 12.
 \]
Using \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p\), we can express \(y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p - x^2\) and similarly for the other terms:
\[
x(s^2 - 2p - x^2) + y(s^2 - 2p - y^2) + z(s^2 - 2p - z^2) = 12,
\]
\[
x(s^2 - 2p - x^2) + y(s^2 - 2p - y^2) + z(s^2 - 2p - z^2) = 12,
\]
\[
s^2(x + y + z) - 2p(x + y + z) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = 12,
\]
\[
s^3 - 2ps - 4 = 12,
\]
\[
s^3 - 2ps = 16.
\]
We already have the equation:
\[
s(s^2 - 3p) = -8.
\]

\boxed{2}.

"To determine which grade has the highest proportion of male busboys compared to female busboys, we need to calculate the ratio of male busboys to female busboys for each grade and compare these ratios.

Let's start with the data provided:

- For the 9th grade:
  - Male busboys: 41.1% of 300
  - Female busboys: 39.4% of 300
  - Ratio of male busboys to female busboys: \(\frac{41.1\% \times 300}{39.4\% \times 300} = \frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.04\)

- For the 10th grade:
  - Male busboys: 34.4% of 300
  - Female busboys: 33.1% of 300
  - Ratio of male busboys to female busboys: \(\frac{34.4\% \times 300}{33.1\% \times 300} = \frac{34.4}{33. 1} \approx 1.04\)

- For the 11th grade:
  - Male busboys: 20.6% of 300
  - Female busboys: 13.8% of 300
  - Ratio of male busboys to female busboys: \(\frac{20.6\% \times 300}{13.8\% \times 300} = \frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.50\)

- For the 12th grade:
  - Male busboys: 11.6% of 300
  - Female busboys: 8.6% of 300
  - Ratio of male busboys to female busboys: \(\frac{11.6\% \times 300}{8.6\% \times 300} = \frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.35\)

Now, let's compare the ratios:
- 9th grade: 1.04
- 10th grade:  1.04
- 11th grade: 1.50
- 12th grade: 1.35

The highest ratio is for the 11th grade, which is approximately 1.50. This means that the number of male busboys in the 11th grade is 1.50 times the number of female busboys.

Therefore, the grade with the highest proportion of male busboys compared to female busboys is the \(\boxed{11}\)th grade.```


The final answer is $\boxed{11}$.```

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then combine the results.

First, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are not in the domain of the function.

Next, let's analyze the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value is a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
The absolute value function will make this expression non-negative, so \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\) for all \(x\). The only time \(|x^2 - 81| = 0\) is when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).

Now, we need to determine when the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative.  Since the numerator is always non-negative and is zero only at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), the sign of the fraction depends on the sign of the denominator \(x(x - 36)\).

The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). For \(x < 0\) or \(x > 36\), the denominator is positive. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative when the denominator is negative, which is when \(0 < x < 36\).

Combining this with the fact that \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not solutions (since the numerator is zero at these points), the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36 \text{ and } x \neq 9.\]
This can be written in interval notation as:
\((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. The perimeter of the rectangular field with a semicircular area attached to each end is 400 meters. The rectangular field has a width of \( w \) meters and a length of \( l \) meters. The semicircular areas each have a diameter equal to the width \( w \) of the rectangle, so the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The perimeter of the field consists of the two lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with diameter \( w \), which is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi w \). Therefore, the total perimeter of the field is given by:
\[
2l + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \pi w \right) = 2l + \pi w
\]
We know that the perimeter is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2l + \pi w = 400
\]
We need to express the area \( A  \) of the rectangular field in terms of \( w \). The area of the rectangular field is:
\[
A = l \cdot w
\]
From the perimeter equation, we can solve for \( l \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w \implies l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}
\]
Substituting this expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \right) w = \frac{400w - \pi w^2}{2} = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0 \implies \pi w = 200 \implies w = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
To confirm that this value of \( w \) gives a maximum, we check the second derivative:
\[
 \frac{d^2A}{dw^2} = -\pi
\]
Since the second derivative is negative, the function \( A \) has a maximum at \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \). Substituting \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \), we get:
\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
\]
The area of the rectangular field is:
\[
A = l \cdot w = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
To express this area in four decimal places, we calculate:
\[
\frac{20000}{\pi} \approx 6366.1977
\]
Rounding to four decimal places, the largest possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find the shortest distance from the origin to the curve given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function between a point \((x, y)\) on the curve and the origin \((0, 0)\). The distance \(d\) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \ sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \(d\), we minimize \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0

Factor out \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three solutions:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}

\[

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \text{ or } -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain. Solving the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ (x-3)(x+1 ) = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \text{ or } x = -1 \]
Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.

So, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0  \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we need to find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the orthocenter of the given game of dipyramid, we need to analyze the geometry of the game of dipyramid. A game of dipyramid is essentially a bipyramid with a square base, and its orthocenter is the point where the four altitudes of the pyramid intersect.

Given that the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices of the square base are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can use the fact that the orthocenter of a game of dipyramid is the same as the orthocenter of the square base when the pyramid is right (i.e., the apex is directly above the center of the base).

The orthocenter of a square is the intersection of its diagonals, which is also the center of the square. Since the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the square are given, and the orthocenter is the center of the square, we can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a square is constant and equal to four times the square of the distance from the point to the center of the square plus twice  the square of the side length of the square.

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the orthocenter of the game of dipyramid is the same as the orthocenter of the square base, and the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter of the square base is the same as the distance from \( P \) to the center of the square base.

Given the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the square base are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and knowing that the orthocenter of the game of dipyramid is the center of the square base, we can use the fact that the center of the square base is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. Since the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given, and the orthocenter is the center of the square base, the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter is the same as the distance from \( P \) to the center of the square base.

The distance from \( P \) to the center of the square base can be found using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the square is constant . The distance from \( P \) to the center of the square base is the average of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the square, which is the same as the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter of the game of dipyramid.

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter of the game of dipyramid is the same as the distance from \( P \) to the center of the square base, which is the average of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the square base.

   - \(7^1 = 7\)
   - \(7^2 = 49\)

3.  **Divide 286 by 49:**
   \[
   286 \div 49 \approx 5.837 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}

   \]

4. **Divide 41 by 7:**
   \[
   41 \div 7 \approx 5.857 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
   \]
   - This means the coefficient for \(7^1\) is 5.
   - Subtract \(5 \times 7 = 35\) from 41:

d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \ frac{|12 + 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the smallest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

\[
\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}

By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships for the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\):
1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions as \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[ S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \]
\[ S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \]
\[ S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \]

From the second Vieta's formula, we  know:
\[ \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \]
This can be rewritten as:

The polynomial can be derived from the original polynomial by considering the product of the roots taken two at a time.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one potlode. We are given the cost of a jumbo-uitve for both Drie potlode and Vyf potlode, and we know that the total cost for a pot^t in each case is the same. Let's denote the cost of one potlode as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The cost of 3 potlode and a jumbo-uitve is \$1.24.
2. The cost of 5 potlode and a jumbo-uitve is \$1.82.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
\[
3x + y = 1.24 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
5x + y = 1.82 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
where \( y \) is the cost of one jumbo-uitve.

To find \( x \), we can eliminate \( y \) by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):
\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.2 4
\]
\[
5x + y - 3x - y = 0.58

\[

\[

So, the cost of one potlode is \( \$0.29 \).

To find the cost of one pot^t in sent, we need to convert \$0.29 to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we have:
\[

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by performing the long division.

Let's go through the long division step-by-step:

- \(500\) goes into \(1370\) (we add a decimal point and a zero to 137, making it 1370) \(2\) times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write \(2\) after the decimal point.
- Subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(3700\). \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500 \). So, we write \(7\) next to the \(2\).
- Subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(2000\). \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write \(4\) next to the \(7\).
- Subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{0.274}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices of the rectangle. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the Geometry of the Problem:**
   - Let the rectangle \(ABCD\) have side lengths \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\).
   - The center of the rectangle \(O\) is the point \((0,0)\) if we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).
   - The distance from any point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
   - The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the vertex \(A = (-a, b)\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\).

2. **Determine the region where the point is closer to the center than to any vertex :**
   - A point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to vertex \(A\) if \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\).
   - Squaring both sides, we get \(x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2\).
   - Expanding and simplifying, we get \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2\), which simplifies to \(0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2\), or \(2by - 2ax < a^2 + b^2\), or \(by - ax < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\).

   - Similarly, we can find the conditions for the point to be closer to the center than to the other vertices. The region where the point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by these inequalities.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Region:**
    - The region where the point is closer to the center than to any vertex is a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The area of this smaller rectangle is \(a \times b\).
   - The area of the original rectangle is \(2a \times 2b = 4ab\).
   - Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is \(\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}\).

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).```

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq r < 6.\]

To find \(q\), we divide 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9.\]
So, the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now we can substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r.\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[54 = 54 + r.\]

\[r = 0.\]

\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{as } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{as } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) \):
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the ceiling function:
\[ f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than 4, we use the floor function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45 }) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
First, we need to find the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have:
\[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4. \]
Since 4 is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = f(4) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The problem states that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the 2 diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's identify the numbers in the grid:
- The top-left corner is \( n-3 \).
- The top-middle is \( 3 \).
- The top-right is \( n+1 \).
- The middle-left is \( n+2 \).
- The middle-middle is \( 2n-9 \).
- The middle-right is \( 1 \).
- The bottom-left is \( 2 \).
- The bottom-middle is \( n \).
- The bottom-right is \( n-1 \).

We need to find the common sum \( S \) for each row, column, and diagonal. Let's start with the first row:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = S \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2 n + 1 = S \]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's check the first column:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = S \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1 = S \]
This confirms that \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Now, let's check the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[ (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = S \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13 = S \]
So, \( S = 4n - 13 \).

Since \( S \) must be the same for all rows, columns, and diagonals, we can set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[ 14 =  2n \]
\[ n = 7 \]

To verify, we can check the values in the grid with \( n = 7 \):
- The top-left is \( 7-3 = 4 \).
- The top-middle is \( 3 \).
- The top-right is \( 7+1 = 8 \).
- The middle-left is \( 7+2 = 9 \).
- The middle-middle is \( 2(7)-9 = 5 \).
- The middle-right is \( 1 \).
- The bottom-left is \( 2 \).
- The bottom-middle is \( 7 \).
- The bottom-right is \( 7-1 = 6 \).

The sum of the first row is:
\[ 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \]
The sum of the first column is:
\[ 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \]
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[ 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).```","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

First, let's calculate the distance Jim walks. Jim walks around the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the rectangle is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha walks. Martha walks directly from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner, which is the diagonal of the rectangle. The length of the diagonal \( d \) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2 } = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the properties \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first simplify each term in the expression. Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\),  we can rewrite \(1 + \omega\) as \(-\omega^2\) and \(1 + \omega^2\) as \(-\omega\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\omega^2 = \frac{1}{\omega}\) and \(\omega = \frac{1}{\omega^2}\) (since \(\omega \cdot \omega^2 = 1\)). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\omega - \omega^2.
\]

Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can substitute \(-\omega - \omega^2\) with \(1\):
\[
-\omega - \omega^2 = 1.

 Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).```

The coordinates of \(D\) are \((0, 0)\) and the coordinates of \(A\) are \((-3, 3)\).
