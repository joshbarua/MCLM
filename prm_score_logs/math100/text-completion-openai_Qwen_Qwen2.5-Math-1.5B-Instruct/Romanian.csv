"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle. We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and that \(EF = 7\). Since \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]

Substituting the known value of \(EF\):

\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation for \(DE\):

\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = \frac{7}{\frac{7}{10}} = 7 \times \frac{10}{7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating \( z \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.
2. Rotate the translated \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise.
3. Translate the rotated \( z \) back to the original position relative to \( c \).

Let's go through each step in detail.

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**

   The translation of \( z \) by \(-c\) is given by:
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
    \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise:**

   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

   Therefore, we need to multiply \( z' \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
    \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated \( z'' \) back to the original position relative to \( c \):**

   The translation back is given by adding \( c \) to \( z'' \):
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).```只需要 answer```\boxed{6 - 5i}``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 can be written as \(2 \times 121\).

2. Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 can be written as \(11 \times 11\).

3. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
    \]

4. We can now rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}
   \]

5. Since \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we can simplify the expression:
   \[
   \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
   \]

So, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).```


The final answer is $\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}$.```\( \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \). The final answer is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False

"1. **Identify the general term**: To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by:
   \[

\[

So, the expression \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) simplifies to:

Next, we reduce 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \implies 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7 }

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the internal angles of a regular pentagon and the angles formed by rotating a regular pentagon to coincide with itself.

A regular pentagon has internal angles of \(108^\circ\). When we rotate a regular pentagon, we are essentially looking at the symmetry of the pentagon. The symmetry of a regular pentagon is described by its rotational symmetry, which means we can rotate the pentagon by certain angles and it will look the same.

The angles of rotation that bring the pentagon back to itself are the angles that are multiples of \(72^\circ\) (since \(360^\circ / 5 = 72^\circ\)). These angles are \(72^\circ, 144^\circ, 216^\circ, 288^\circ\), and \(360^\circ\).

"To determine the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right).
\]
This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\).  Therefore, we set up the following equations for the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right).
\]
This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3 + y}{2} = 6.
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8.
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9.

\[

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to identify both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We need to solve the equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-14) = 25 + 56 = 81 \]

Now, find the roots:

\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2} \]

 This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \]
\[ x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2 \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

So, \( c = 0 \).

### Sum of the Asymptotes

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is defined as the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) for all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\). This is equivalent to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \( A^T A \).

\[

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to find the coefficients for the powers of 9. We start by dividing 36 by the highest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36, which is \(9^1 = 9\):
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
This means that \(36_{10} = 4 \cdot 9^1 + 0 \cdot 9^0 = 40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```\\

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting  this into the expression gives:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the gre und度 of a squig as \( S \) and the gre und度 of a goolee as \( G \).

The problem states that ifDayle trees two squigs and one goolee, the total gre und度 is the same as the gre unddegree of one squig. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2S + G = S \]

To find the relationship between \( S \) and \( G \), we need to isolate \( G \). Subtract \( S \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S + G - S = S - S \]
\[ S + G = 0 \]
\[ G = -S \]

This equation tells us that the gre unddegree of the goolee is the negative of the gre unddegree of the squig. However, the problem also states that the gre unddegree of two squigs and one goolee is equal to the gre unddegree of one squig. This means that the gre unddegree of the goolee must be subtracted from the gre unddegree of two squigs, and the result must be equal to the gre unddegree of one squig.  This is consistent with the equation we derived.

Now, we need to find the gre unddegree of the gre unddegree combinations that Dayle trees with Dayle trees two squigs and one goolee. The gre unddegree of Dayle trees with Dayle trees two squigs and one goolee is \( 2S + G \). We already know from the equation that \( 2S + G = S \).

Therefore, the gre unddegree of Dayle trees with Dayle trees two squigs and one goolee is the same as the gre unddegree of one squig, which is \( S \).

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we need to equate the given polynomials and compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

The given polynomials are:
\[ P(t) = 3t^2 + 5t + a \]
\[ Q(t) = 4t^2 + bt - 2 \]
and their product is:
\[ P(t) \cdot Q(t) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

First, let's expand the product \( P(t) \cdot Q(t) \):
\[ (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \]

We will use the distributive property (FOIL method for polynomials) to expand this product:
\[ = 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (- 2) \]

Now, let's calculate each term:
\[ = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a \]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[ = 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a \]

We know this must equal the given polynomial:
\[ 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \( 12 = 12 \) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
3. \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
4. \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
5. \( -2a = 6 \)

 Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 5:
\[ -2a = 6 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

From equation 2:
\[ 3b + 20 = 26 \]
\[ 3b = 6 \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Now, we have \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \).

Finally, we find \( a + b \):
\[ a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b \) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by noting the given information: the volume of the tank is increasing at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the tank is increasing at a rate of 2 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. To find the rate of change of the radius, we need to differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi \left( 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \right) \]

Given that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 2\), we substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 20\pi = \pi \left( 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + r^2 \cdot 2 \right) \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 20 =  2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + 2r^2 \]

\[ 10 = r \frac{dr}{dt} h + r^2 \]

To find the radius \(r\) when the height \(h\) is 10 meters, we substitute \(h = 10\) into the equation:

\[ 10 = r \frac{dr}{dt} \cdot 10 + r^2 \]

\[ 10 = 10r \frac{dr}{dt} + r^2 \]

Since the problem asks for the radius of the tank, we need to find \(r\) when the height is 10 meters. However, we do not have \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) directly, but we can solve for \(r\) by considering the geometry of the problem. We know that the volume is increasing at a rate that is independent of the rate of change of the height, so we can use the simplified form when \(h = 10\):

\[ 10 = r^2 \]

Solving for \(r\), we get:

\[ r = \sqrt{10} \]

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:

\[  \boxed{\sqrt{10}} \] meters.```

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every line of the form \( y = bx + c \) at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) and the conditions under which it can intersect any line.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's examine the behavior of \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \):
\[
f(a) = a^2.
\]

The function \( f(x) \) is a parabola for \( x \geq a \) and a line for \( x < a \). The line has a slope of \( a \) and a y-intercept of \( 2a \).

To ensure that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every line \( y = bx + c \), we need to check the conditions under which the parabola and the line can intersect.

###  Case 1: \( x \geq a \)
For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \). We need to find if there exists a value of \( x \) such that:
\[
ax^2 = bx + c.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \( x \):
\[
ax^2 - bx - c = 0.
\]
For this quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:
\[
b^2 + 4ac \geq 0.
\]

### Case 2: \( x < a \)
For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). We need to find if there exists a value of \( x \) such that:
\[
ax + 2a = bx + c.
\]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[
(a - b)x = c - 2a.
\]
For this linear equation to have a solution, \( a \neq b \) (otherwise, the equation would be \( 0 = c - 2a \), which may not hold for all \( c \)). The solution for \( x \ ) is:
\[
x = \frac{c - 2a}{a - b}.
\]
We need \( x < a \):
\[
\frac{c - 2a}{a - b} < a.
\]
Solving this inequality:
\[
c - 2a < a(a - b),
\]
\[
c < a^2 - ab + 2a.
\]

### Combining the Conditions
To ensure that \( f(x) \) intersects every line \( y = bx + c \), the discriminant condition and the inequality must be satisfied for all possible values of \( b \) and \( c \). The critical condition is the discriminant condition \( b^2 + 4ac \geq 0 \).

For large values of \( a \), the parabola \( ax^2 \) will grow much faster than the line \( ax + 2a \) as \( x \) increases. Therefore, for \( a \) to be the largest value such that \( f(x) \) intersects every line, we need to ensure that the parabola is sufficiently "" flat"" so that it can cover all possible slopes \( b \) and intercepts \( c \).

 By analyzing the behavior of the function and the conditions, we find that the largest value of \( a \) that ensures \( f(x) \) intersects every line \( y = bx + c \) is when \( a = 2 \). This is because for \( a = 2 \), the parabola and the line can cover all possible slopes and intercepts.

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]```
The final answer is \( \boxed{2} \). This value of \( a \) ensures that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every line of the form \( y = bx + c \) at least once. The reasoning involves analyzing the behavior of the function at the point of transition and ensuring that the discriminant condition for the quadratic equation is satisfied for all possible values of \( b \) and \( c \). The largest value of \( a \) that meets this condition is \( 2 \). This value of \( a \) ensures that the parabola and the line can cover all possible slopes and intercepts, thus intersecting every line \( y = bx + c \).

"Perpendicularize, a round心 are the center and the radius of the circle. The general form of the equation of a circle is \(x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\), and it can be transformed into the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\) by completing the square.

Given the equation \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\), we need to complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\).

1. Completing the square for \(x\):
   \[
   x^2 - 10x \quad \text{can be written as} \quad (x-5)^2 - 25.
   \]

2. Completing the square for \(y\):
   \[
   y^2 + 6y \quad \text{can be written as} \quad (y+3)^2 - 9.
   \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[
(x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0.
\ ]
Combine the constant terms:
\[
(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0.
\]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[
(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c.
\]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) represents a circle with center \((5, -3)\) and radius \(\sqrt{34 - c}\). We are given that the radius of the circle is 1. Therefore, we set the radius equal to 1:

\sqrt{34 - c} = 1.

\[

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we need to analyze the conditions under which \(f(f(x)) = x\).

First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) = \lambda x - \lambda x^2.\]
Then,
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)(1 - (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)).\]
Simplifying the argument of the second \(f\):
\[1 - (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2.\]
So,
\[f(f(x)) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 x (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\ ]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[\lambda^2 x (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
If \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), then \(f(x) = 0\) or \(f(x) = 0\), respectively, and \(f(f(x)) = 0\), so \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\) are solutions for any \(\lambda\). However, we are interested in the case where \(x \in (0,1)\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

Assuming \(x \in (0,1)\), we can divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
This equation must hold for some \(x \in (0,1)\). Let's analyze the quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2 (1 - x)}.\]
 Multiplying both sides by \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)\) gives:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
This is a complicated equation, so let's check specific values of \(\lambda\).

For \(\lambda = 2\):
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.\]
We need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
Simplifying:
\[f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
Setting \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[4x(1 - x)(1 -  2x + 2x^2) = x.\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide by \(x\):
\[4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 1.\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[4(1 - 3x + 4x^2 - 2x^3) = 1 \Rightarrow 4 - 12x + 16x^2 - 8x^3 = 1 \Rightarrow -8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0.\]
This is a cubic equation, and we need to check if it has solutions in \((0,1)\). By the intermediate value theorem and numerical methods, we can find that this equation does have solutions in \((0,1)\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B) \quad \text{ and} \quad \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B = \cos (A - B).
\]
Applying these formulas, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]
So the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine :
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B) \quad \text{ and} \quad \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying these formulas, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]
So the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ -  \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\) to further simplify:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B =  2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.

Thus,
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ} = -1.

Therefore, \(\theta = 135^\circ\) (since \(\tan 135^\circ = -1\)).

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, we observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum value might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:

\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the maximum value of the function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:

\[
g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2 }} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
\frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

We now evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = \pm 1 \):

\[
g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 } = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1,
\]

\[
g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1,
\]

\[
g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0,
\]

 \[
g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot -1 \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

From these evaluations, we see that the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) \) is also 1, and it is achieved when \( x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Thus, the maximum value is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) and given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) in three-dimensional space. The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v } = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]
Substituting \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot  1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The magnitude of the cross product vector is:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times  \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

Let's denote \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus, we have:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The value of \(\theta\) is such that \(\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} =  e^{i85\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( 2\cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine the value of \( \theta \). Recall that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, and the possible values of \( \theta \) are those that satisfy \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). These values are not standard angles, but we can use the periodicity of the cosine function. Specifically, \( \cos(85\theta) \) will repeat every \( 360^\circ \) or \( 2\pi \) radians. We need to find the equivalent angle within one period.

The golden ratio \(\phi\) has a special property in relation to the roots of the equation \( z^2 - \phi  z + 1 = 0 \), which are:

\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}. \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation, and the powers  of \( z \) will cycle every 12 (since the roots of unity for the golden ratio are related to the 12th roots of unity). Therefore, \( 85 \mod 12 = 1 \), so:

\[ 2\cos(85\theta) = 2\cos(\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use some properties of triangles and the concept of the median and centroid. Let's go through the solution step by step.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that if \(AD\) is a median, then \(AG:GD = 2:1\).

2. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**
   Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AGM\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their heights from the same vertex. Since \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AGM\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGM\):**
    The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its sides. Since the ratio of the sides is \(\frac{1}{3}\), the ratio of the areas is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) is \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

4. **Substitute the given area of triangle \(ABC\):**
   The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) is:

Let's define:

From the problem, we know two things:

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ x + y = 15 \]
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 15 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 0 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first six prime numbers.
2. Determine the total number of ways to choose two prime numbers from these six.
3. Determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers such that their sum is even.
4. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

**Step 1: Identify the first six prime numbers.**
The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose two prime numbers from these six.**
The number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\ ]
So, there are 15 possible ways to choose 2 prime numbers from the first six prime numbers.

**Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers such that their sum is even.**
The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2), the only way to get an even sum is to choose two odd prime numbers. The odd prime numbers from the first six are: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. The number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of these 5 is:
\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]
So, there are 10 ways to choose two prime numbers such that their sum is even.

**Step 4: Calculate the probability.**
The probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
\[

"To determine the value of \( b \) for the punctul \((a, b)\) which lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\) and where \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\).
2. Solve for \( y \).

Let's start by substituting \( x = 4 \) into the equation:
\[ 3(4) + 2y = 12. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 12 + 2y = 12. \]
Next, we isolate \( 2y \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2y = 12 - 12, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 2y = 0. \]
Now, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2:

"To determine the total area of the concave pentagon (umnum) formed by the two right triangles, we need to calculate the area of each triangle and then sum them up.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the first triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.
The area \(A_1\) of the first triangle is given by:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\ ]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the second triangle
The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 4)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 4 units.
The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((3, 4)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 3 units.
The area \(A_2\) of the second triangle is given by:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total area of the concave pentagon
The total area \(A_{\text{total}}\) of the concave pentagon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 6 = 10

Therefore, the total area of the concave pentagon is \(\boxed{10}\).```python

- The digit 0 is in the units place.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probabilities of the pionul being placed on a black square in the last step of the game. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Game Setup:**
   - There is a 4x4 grid of squares, half of which are black and half are white.
   - The first number (let's call it \(a\)) is obtained by dividing a randomly chosen number from the top row by 4 and taking the remainder (which will be 1, 2, or 3). This result determines which row the number \(a\) comes from in the table.
   - The second number (let's call it \(b\)) is obtained by dividing a randomly chosen number from the leftmost column by 5 and taking the remainder (which will be 1, 2, 3, or 4). This result determines which column the number \(b\) comes from in the table.
   - The pionul is placed on the square where the row determined by \(a\) and the column determined by \(b\) intersect.

2. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Since the grid is 4x4, half of the squares are black and half  are white. This means there are 8 black squares and 8 white squares.
   - The probability that \(a\) and \(b\) intersect on a black square is the same as the probability that they intersect on a white square because the grid is symmetric and each square has an equal chance of being chosen.
   - Therefore, the probability that the pionul is placed on a black square is simply the fraction of black squares in the grid, which is \(\frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}\).

So, the probability that the pionul will be placed on a black square is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```
The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.```

"To determine the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we start by simplifying the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). So the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we perform the division of 4321 by 20000000. This can be done by expressing 4321 in terms of its decimal form when divided by 20000000:

\[
4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605
\]

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321 }{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is:

The final answer is \(\boxed{0.00021605}\).```

Let's start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\), which tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), and \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can  group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]

This can be written as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\ sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\). However, a more efficient approach is to use the product-to-sum identities and symmetry properties of sine and cosine functions. It is known that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can be simplified using known results from trigonometry. Specifically, for the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), the product is given by \(\frac{1}{16}\).

Thus, the value of the original expression is:

- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, measured from the positive \( x \)-axis.
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the \( z \)-coordinate is always equal to a constant \( c \). This implies that the height of any point in the \( z \)-direction is fixed at \( c \), while the radial distance \( r \) and the angular coordinate \( \theta \) can vary. Therefore, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

\]

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we first calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. This means that if \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots  of \( f(x) \) is:

"To solve the given expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This implies \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) to express the reciprocals of the squares of the cosines. However, it's more straightforward to use the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x \), which gives us:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\). Thus , \(\tan^2 70^\circ = \cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\) and \(\tan^2 50^\circ = \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 3\). This is a known trigonometric identity for specific angles. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We are given that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, excluding one angle, is \(1070^\circ\). We need to find the number of sides of the polygon.

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = 180^\circ (n - 2)
   \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Let the excluded angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   180^\circ (n - 2) - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   180^\circ (n - 2) - 1070^\circ = x
   \]
   \[
   x = 180^\circ (n - 2) - 10 70^\circ
   \]

5. **Using the Property of Interior Angles:**
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of the polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0^\circ < 180^\circ (n - 2) - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Finding the Range for \(n\):**
   Solve the inequality for \(n\):
   \[
   0 < 180^\circ (n - 2) - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < 180^\circ (n - 2) < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n - 2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
    Simplify the fractions:
   \[

   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.944 < n < 8.944
   \]

7. **Determining the Integer Value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value is:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by understanding the condition that \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We need to solve the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \). The quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) can be used here, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2  \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

So, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values to find such an \( x \):

\[
\begin{align*}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \\
5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \\
\end{align*}
\]

So, \( x = 5 \) or \( x = -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{ 23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

This gives us two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 + 18 = 17
\]

We need to check both solutions to ensure they satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

1. For \( t = 4 \):
\[
t + 2 = 6
\]
We need to check if the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23 is 6:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This is true, so \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

2. For \( t = 17 \):
\[
t + 2 = 19
\]
We need to check if the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23 is 19:
\[
 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This is true, so \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Since both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) satisfy the conditions, the problem asks for an odd \( t \). Therefore, the solution is:

To determine how much Care exists between care and FA?!, we need to find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter. Let's follow the steps below:

1. **Find the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic meter, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ meter}
   \]

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This product can be found using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Calculating the squares, we have:

\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

"To determine the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1, we first recognize that the sequence of odd numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the arguments of the sine function.

First, we note that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because \(\cot^{-1} y = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\sin (2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\).  Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), we have \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2 } = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). These values must be checked to ensure they satisfy the original equation. Since both values are real and finite, they are both valid solutions.

"To determine if the two lines are parallel and to find the distance between them, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check if the lines are parallel:**
   Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.
   The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).
   The direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).
   We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).
   Therefore, the lines are parallel.

2. **Find the distance between the two parallel lines:**
   The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{b}\) is given by the formula:
   \[
    d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{b}|}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

   First, we find \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
   \[
   \mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b } \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
   \[
   \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8))
   = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72)
   = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58)
   = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   The magnitude of this vector is:
    \[
   |\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}

   The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
   \[
   |\mathbf{b}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}

   Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:
   \[
   d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{b}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Let's analyze each point:

1. \((3, 2)\):
   - \( -5 < 3 < 5 \) is true.
   - \( -4 < 2 < 4 \) is true.
   - Therefore, \((3, 2)\) is inside the rectangle.

2. \((-3, -2)\):
   - \( -5 < -3 < 5 \) is true.
   - \( -4 < -2 < 4 \) is true.
   - Therefore, \((-3, -2)\) is inside the rectangle.

3. \((0, 0)\):
   - \( -5 < 0 < 5 \) is true.
   - \( -4 < 0 < 4 \) is true.
   - Therefore, \ ((0, 0)\) is inside the rectangle.

4. \((5, 4)\):
   - \( -5 < 5 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((5, 4)\) is not inside the rectangle.

5. \((-5, -4)\):
   - \( -5 < -5 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((-5, -4)\) is not inside the rectangle.

6. \((6, 3)\):
   - \( -5 < 6 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((6, 3)\) is not inside the rectangle.

7. \((-6, -3)\):
   - \( -5 < -6 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((-6, -3)\) is not inside the rectangle.

8. \((7, 2)\):
   - \( -5 < 7 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((7, 2)\) is not inside the rectangle.

9. \((-7, -2)\):
   - \( -5 < -7 \) is false.
   - Therefore, \((-7, -2)\) is not inside the  rectangle.

The points that lie strictly inside the rectangle are \((3, 2)\), \((-3, -2)\), and \((0, 0)\).

This can be verified by checking that each of these points satisfies the conditions \( -5 < x < 5 \) and \( -4 < y < 4 \), while the points \((5,4)\), \((-5, -4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((-6, -3)\), \((7, 2)\), and \((-7, -2)\) do not satisfy these conditions and therefore lie on or outside the rectangle.","[{Interval.open(-3, -2), (0, 0), (3, 2)}, '(3,2), (-3,-2), (0,0)']",63,"[63, '63']",False
"To solve for \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c}
 \]

Using the property of the cross product that \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = - \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u} \), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})

We know from the problem statement that:

Since \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b }\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Similarly, since \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting these into our expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we add these vectors together:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\  108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

   - Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).

   \[
   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h

   The area of \( \triangle ABD \) is:

   [\triangle ABD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h

   Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD  \), the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

   The area of \( \triangle BCD \) is:

   \]
   This simplifies to:

   Simplify both sides:

   Simplify:

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3 , so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can use geometric properties and combinatorial reasoning.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) chosen randomly on its circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Insight:**
   - For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.
   - This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate between the two segments. For example, the order could be \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), etc.

3. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements :**
   - There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence, which is \(4! = 24\).
   - However, not all of these arrangements will result in intersecting segments. We need to count only the arrangements where the points alternate.
   - There are exactly 2 such alternating arrangements for any given set of 4 points: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\).

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Since there are 2 favorable arrangements out of 24 possible arrangements, the probability is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]
   - This is because each pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) has 2 out of the 6 possible ways to pair the remaining points \(C\) and \(D\) that result in intersecting segments.

Therefore, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

"1. **Identify the given information and translate it into a geometric problem:**
   - We have a large circle with radius \(2\).
   - There is a smaller circle inside the larger circle with radius \(1\).
   - The area of the ring (the region between the two circles) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the areas of the circles:**
   - The area of the larger circle is:
     \[
     \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
     \]
   - The area of the smaller circle is:
     \[

3. **Determine the area of the ring:**
   - The area of the ring is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle:
     \[
     4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
     \]

4. **Verify the given area of the ring:**
   - According to the problem, the area of the ring is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
     \[

   - There seems to be a discrepancy here, but let's proceed with the given information that the area of the ring is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

5. **Determine the area of the region outside the smaller circle but inside the larger circle:**
   - The area of the region outside the smaller circle but inside the larger circle is:
     \[
     4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
     \]

6. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the smaller circle is:
     \[
     \pi

7. **Determine the area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is:
     \[
     3\pi
     \]

8. **Identify the shape of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle:**
   - The region inside the larger circle but outside the  smaller circle is a ring, which can be divided into two sectors of the larger circle.

9. **Determine the angle of each sector:**
   - Since the area of the ring is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, the angle of each sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the full circle's angle, which is \(360^\circ\):
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ

"To determine the number of spherical marbles needed to fill a cylindrical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical container and the spherical marbles, and then find the ratio of the two volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Here, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one spherical marble. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Here, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value,  we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, to find the number of spherical marbles needed to fill the cylindrical container, we divide the volume of the cylindrical container by the volume of one spherical marble:
\[ \text{Number of marbles} = \frac{V_{\text{cylinder}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{72\pi}{288\pi} = \frac{72}{288} = \frac{1}{4} \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's define:
\[
\alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \arcsin 0.5.
\]
This means that:
\[
\sin \alpha = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = 0.5.
\]
We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\ cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Now, substituting \(\sin \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), \(\cos \alpha\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta ) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21 } - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]
Now we need to find the product:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right).
\]
This is a difference of squares:
\[
\left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 - 21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -0.09.
\]
Thus, the value is:

"To determine the speed of the biociclete in inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed in dekameters per minute.
2. Convert the speed from dekameters per minute to meters per second.
3. Convert the speed from meters per second to inches per second.

Step 1: Identify the speed in dekameters per minute.
The speed of the biociclet are given as 20 dekameters per minute.

Step 2: Convert the speed from dekameters per minute to meters per second.
Since 1 dekameter = 10 meters and 1 minute = 60 seconds, we can convert the speed as follows:
\[ 20 \text{ dekameters/minute} = 20 \times 10 \text{ meters/minute} = 200 \text{ meters/minute} \]
\[ 200 \text{ meters/minute} = \frac{200 \text{ meters}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{200}{60} \text{ meters/second} = \frac{10}{3} \text { meters/second} \]

Step 3: Convert the speed from meters per second to inches per second.
Since 1 meter = 39.37 inches, we can convert the speed as follows:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ meters/second} = \frac{10}{3} \times 39.37 \text{ inches/second} = \frac{393.7}{3} \text{ inches/second} = 131.2333\ldots \text{ inches/second} \approx 131.23 \text{ inches/second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the biociclete is \boxed{131.23} inches per second.```

The final answer is \boxed{131.23} inches per second. This is obtained by converting the speed from dekameters per minute to meters per second, and then from meters per second to inches per second. The conversion factors used are 1 dekameter = 10 meters, 1 minute = 60 seconds, and 1 meter = 39.37 inches.","[131.230000000000, '131.23']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To determine the number of ways to form a subcom committee of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The total number of people available to be selected is:
\[ 8 \text{ (Republicans)} + 6 \text{ (democ apparents)} = 14 \text{ (people)} \]

We need to choose 5 out of these 14 people. The number of ways to choose 5 people from 14 is given by the combination formula:
\[ \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

Here, \( n = 14 \) and \( r = 5 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} =  \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} \]

Next, we simplify the factorials. The factorial \( 14! \) (14 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 14, and \( 9! \) (9 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 9. Notice that \( 14! \) can be written as:
\[ 14! = 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9! \]

Substituting this into the combination formula, we get:
\[ \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} \]

The \( 9! \) terms cancel out in the numerator and the denominator:
\[ \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5!} \]

Now, we need  to calculate \( 5! \) (5 factorial), which is:
\[ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{120} \]

We can now perform the multiplication and division step-by-step:
\[ 14 \times 13 = 182 \]
\[ 182 \times 12 = 2184 \]
\[ 2184 \times 11 = 24024 \]
\[ 24024 \times 10 = 240240 \]

Finally, we divide by 120:
\[ \frac{240240}{120} = 2002 \]

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcom committee of 5 members from 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the three consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose arithmetic mean is 24. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the arithmetic mean of these three integers is 24. The arithmetic mean of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = 24
\]

Simplifying the numerator, we get:

\[
\frac{3n}{3} = 24 \implies n = 24

So, the three consecutive integers are \( n-1 = 23 \), \( n = 24 \), and \( n+1 = 25 \).

First, note that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we need to find the perimeter of the triangle given that there exists a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(BM = CM\) and \(AM\) divides \(\angle BAC\) into two equal angles, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

To find the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\), we need to determine the lengths of \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(BC\). Since \(AB = AC\) and \(M\) is the midpoint of  \(BC\), we can use the properties of isosceles triangles and trigonometry to find these lengths.

Consider \(\triangle ABM\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = 90^\circ\). Using the definition of cosine in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{AB}
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\), we can express \(BM\) as:

\]
Thus,
\[
\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BC}{2AB}
\]
\[
BC = 2AB \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). To find the relationship between \(AB\) and \(BC\), we can use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\sin(\angle BCD)}

Since \ (\angle BCD = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\), we have:

\sin(\angle BCD) = \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)

\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin(3\theta)\). Using the triple angle formula for sine:
\[
\sin(3\theta) = 3\sin(\theta) - 4\sin^3(\theta)
\]
We also know that:
\[
\sin(\theta) = 2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin(3\theta) = 3(2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)) - 4(2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))^3
\]
 \[
\sin(3\theta) = 6 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 32 \sin^3 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos^3 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Given the constraints and the relationships derived, we can solve for \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(BC\) and find the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\). After solving these equations, we find that the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

"To determine the median of a sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the sequence be \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers can be expressed as:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\) and the last term \(a+26\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a+26\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
 \]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]

The sequence of 27 consecutive integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we calculate:

\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of the sequence is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) for which this inequality holds.

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4). \]
Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), and \(x^2 + 4 > 0\) for all real \(x\) (because \(x^2 \geq 0\) and adding 4 makes it positive), we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\).

Next, we need to find the maximum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\). To do this, we can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \(x^2\):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
 The term \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always non-negative and achieves its minimum value of 4 when \(x^2 = 0\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[ (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0. \]
This minimum value is achieved when \(x = 0\).

To find the maximum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) within the given inequality, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let's set \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
We solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots:
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100 }}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}. \]
This gives us the roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) holds for:
\[ -7 < y < 3. \]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
This implies:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Combining this with the fact that \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

"给定方程组：

xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
我们的目标是找到 \(xy + yz + zx\) 的值。

首先，回忆立方和的恒等式：
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
使用给定的 \(xyz = 4\) 和 \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) 的值，我们可以将这些代入恒等式：
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
这简化为：
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
或
 \[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
接下来，我们使用平方和的恒等式：
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
设 \(s = x + y + z\) 和 \(p = xy + yz + zx\)。那么：
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
将此代入方程，我们得到：
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
现在，我们使用给定的第三个方程：
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
这可以重写为：
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
使用 \(x+y+z = s\) 的事实，我们可以将它重写为：
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y ) + yz(s-x) = 12,
\]
这简化为：
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12,
\]
或
\[
s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
这简化为：
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
或
\[
sp = 24.
\]
现在我们有两个方程：
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
从第二个方程，我们可以表示 \(p\) 为：
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
将此代入第一个方程，我们得到：
\[
-8 = s \left( s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s} \right),
\]
这简化为：
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
或
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
所以
\[
s = 4.
\]
将 \(s = 4\) 代回 \(p\) 的表达式 中，我们得到：
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of the number of b type students who received the highest score compared to the number of f type students who received the same score. The problem states that the number of b type students who received the highest score is 135% of the number of f type students who received the same score.

Let's denote the number of f type students who received the highest score as \( f_h \). According to the problem, the number of b type students who received the highest score is \( 1.35 f_h \).

We need to find the class in which the percentage of b type students who received the highest score is closest to 135%. We can compare the given percentages in the table to 135%.

The table provides the percentage of b type students who received the highest score in each class:
- Clas a 9a: 41.1%
- Clas a 10a: 34.4%
- Clas a 11a: 20.6%
- Clas a 12a: 11.6%

None of these percentages are exactly 135%, but we need to find the closest one . The closest percentage to 135% is 135% itself, which is not present in the table. However, we can see that the percentage of f type students who received the highest score in each class is also provided, but we don't need those values to answer the question.

Since the problem asks for the class where the percentage of b type students who received the highest score is closest to 135%, and the closest value in the table is 41.1% for Clas a 9a, we can conclude that the closest class is Clas a 9a.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's simplify the denominator and the numerator separately.

The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which can be factored as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.\]

Next, let's consider the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator is:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
This expression is always non-negative (either positive or zero), and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).

Now, let's analyze the inequality \(\frac{|x^2  - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0\). For the fraction to be negative, the numerator and the denominator must have opposite signs. Since the numerator is always non-negative (except when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), the denominator must be negative. Therefore, we need:
\[x(x - 36) < 0.\]
This inequality holds when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\).

However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36.\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:
\[\boxed{(0, 36)}.\]```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the largest possible shape that can fit within the given constraints of the Teren tridollar and the information about the path it takes. The Teren tridollar has a path that is 400 meters long, and the path consists of two sides of a rectangle and two semicircles.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The path consists of two sides of the rectangle (each of length \( L \)) and two semicircles, each with a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle \( W \). The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \), so the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the path is therefore:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

To maximize the area of the Teren tridollar, we need to maximize the area of the rectangle \( A = L \times W \). From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W  \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = L \times W = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) \times W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100 \]

 The area \( A \) is then:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[ A \approx \frac{20000}{3.14159} \approx 6366.1977 \]

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
   - \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles in a right triangle:**
   - In \(\triangle RST\), the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), the sum of \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) must be \(90^\circ\).

3. **Use the property of complementary angles:**
   - If \(\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ\), then \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\).

4. **Relate \(\sin{T}\) to \(\sin{R}\):**
   - For any angle \(\theta\), \(\sin{(90^\circ - \theta)} = \cos{\theta}\).
    - Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \sin{(90^\circ - R)} = \cos{R}\).

5. **Find \(\cos{R}\):**
   - We know \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\).
   - Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1\), we can find \(\cos{R}\).

6. **Calculate \(\cos{R}\):**
   \[
   \sin^2{R} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{25}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the origin to the point on the parabola \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) that is closest to the origin. The distance from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) is given by the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \ sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2)
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three critical points: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points to find the minimum value:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2 })^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum distance is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), and \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will handle these cases separately based on the definition of the function \( f \).

### Case 1: \( f(x) = 0 \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 0 \):
   \[
   x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3)  = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Multiply through by \(-1\):
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we have \( x = -1 \), but this does not satisfy \( x > 3 \) either. Therefore, there are no solutions in this range.

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \).  Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Case 2: \( f(x) = 6 \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. **For \( x \leq 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 6 \):
   \[
   -x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. **For \( x > 3 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
   \]
   This is a cubic equation. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
    \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Since we have found \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \), we now find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):

\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometry of the octahedron and the distances given from the point \(P\) to the vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be represented in 3D space as \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\). Let's denote these vertices as \(A = (1, 0, 0)\), \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\), \(C = (0, 1, 0)\), \(D = (0, -1, 0)\), \(E = (0, 0, 1)\), and \(F = (0, 0, -1)\).

We are given the distances from point \(P\) to these vertices: \(PA = 3\), \(PB = 7\), \(PC = 8\), \(PD = 9\), and \(PE = 11\). We need to find the distance from \(P\) to \(PF\).

First, let's denote the coordinates of \(P\) as \((x , y, z)\). The distance from \(P\) to each vertex can be expressed as follows:
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3,
\]
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7,
\]
\[
PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8,
\]
\[
PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9,
\]
\[
PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11.
\]

We can square these equations to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49,
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64,
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81,
\ ]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121.
\]

Expanding and simplifying these equations, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x = 8,
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 48,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y = 63,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2y = 80,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121 \ implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z = 120.
\]

Now, let's denote \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = k\). Then we have:
\[
k - 2x = 8,
\]
\[
k + 2x = 48,
\]
\[
k - 2y = 63,
\]
\[
k + 2y = 80,
\]
\[
k - 2z = 120.
\]

From the first two equations, we can solve for \(k\) and \(x\):
\[
k - 2x = 8 \implies k = 8 + 2x,
\]
\[
k + 2x = 48 \implies k = 48 - 2x.
\]
Setting these equal gives:
\[
8 + 2x = 48 - 2x \implies 4x = 40 \implies x = 10.
\]
So, \(k = 8 + 2(10) = 28\).

Now, we can solve for \( y\) and \(z\):
\[
k - 2y = 63 \implies 28 - 2y = 63 \implies -2y = 35 \implies y = -\frac{35}{2},
\]
\[
k + 2y = 80 \implies 28 + 2y = 80 \implies 2y = 52 \implies y = 26.
\]
There seems to be a contradiction, so let's recheck the calculations. Instead, we can directly use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of an octahedron from a point is constant. The sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to the vertices is:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 2(k + x^2 + y^2 + z^2).
\]
We know:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 The final answer is  $\boxed{13}$.

"To determine the ratio of the center of mass (CM) of Jen's softball to the center of mass of Jack's baseball, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the center of mass of Jen's softball.
2. Calculate the center of mass of Jack's baseball.
3. Determine the ratio of these two centers of mass.

### Step 1: Calculate the center of mass of Jen's softball
Jen's softball has a mass of 200 grams. Since the softball is a point object, its center of mass is located at its geometric center. For simplicity, we can assume the center of mass is at the midpoint of the ball. However, since the problem does not specify the shape or size of the ball, we will assume it is a point mass for the purpose of this calculation.

### Step 2: Calculate the center of mass of Jack's baseball
Jack's baseball has a mass of 150 grams. Similarly, since the baseball is a point object, its center of mass is located at its geometric center. Again, for simplicity, we can assume the center of mass is at the midpoint of the ball. However, since the problem does not specify the shape or size of the ball, we will assume it is  a point mass for the purpose of this calculation.

### Step 3: Determine the ratio of the centers of mass
The ratio of the center of mass of Jen's softball to the center of mass of Jack's baseball is simply the ratio of their masses, since both centers of mass are located at their respective geometric centers and are considered point masses.

The ratio is:
\[
\frac{\text{Mass of Jen's softball}}{\text{Mass of Jack's baseball}} = \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{150 \text{ grams}} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the center of mass of Jen's softball to the center of mass of Jack's baseball is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}\). This represents the ratio of the masses of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball, which is also the ratio of their centers of mass, since they are both point masses. The problem asks for the ratio of the centers of mass, and since the centers of mass are at the geometric centers of the objects, the ratio of the centers of mass is the same as the ratio","[4/3, '\\frac{4}{3}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and record the remainders.

1. \(629 \div 7 = 89\) with a remainder of \(6\)
2. \(89 \div 7 = 12\) with a remainder of \(5\)
3. \(12 \div 7 = 1\) with a remainder of \(5\)
4. \(1 \div 7 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\)

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.

1. \(629 \div 8 = 78\) with a remainder of \(5\)
2. \(78 \div  8 = 9\) with a remainder of \(6\)
3. \(9 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of \(1\)
4. \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\)

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Verify the sum of the base 7 and base 8 digits
The base 7 digits are 1, 5, 5, and 6. The sum of these digits is:
\[1 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 17\]

The base 8 digits are 1, 1, 6, and 5. The sum of these digits is:
\[1 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 13\]

The total sum of the base 7 and base 8 digits is:
\[17 + 13 = 30\]

Thus, the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the number \(629_{10}\) are \(1556_7 \) and \(1165_8\), respectively, and their sum is \(\boxed{30}\).\\

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to understand the relationship between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Given that \( g(x) \) is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we can express \( g(x) \) as follows:

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \), which is the same as evaluating \( f(0) \) because \( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \).

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Next, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator :

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the distance is:

\[
d = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\).

First, let's consider the geometry of the situation. The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the intersection of the diagonals, and it is equidistant from all four vertices. The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions that are closer to \(O\) than to each vertex. This intersection is a smaller rectangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle \(ABCD\).

The smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle \(ABCD\) and has half the side lengths of the original rectangle. Therefore, the area of the smaller rectangle is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the original rectangle.

To see why, consider that the original rectangle has dimensions \(AB\) and \(AD\). The smaller rectangle has dimensions \(\frac{AB}{2}\) and \(\frac{AD}{2}\), so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} =  \frac{AB}{2} \times \frac{AD}{2} = \frac{AB \times AD}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Area of original rectangle}
\]

Since the point is chosen randomly within the original rectangle, the probability that it lies within the smaller rectangle is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Area of original rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).```

Simplifying the right side, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left\lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 1.047 \right\rceil = 2 \ ).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi }{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]```

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total, we need to add their individual amounts together. Let's list their amounts and add them step by step:

1. Linda's amount: \$27.47
2. Sherry's amount: \$35.23
3. June's amount: \$37.37
4. Connie's amount: \$26.52

First, let's add Linda's and Sherry's amounts:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70 \]

Next, let's add June's amount to the previous sum:
\[ 62.70 + 37.37 = 90.07 \]

Finally, let's add Connie's amount to the previous sum:
\[ 90.07 + 26.52 = 116.59 \]

So, the total amount of money they have together is \$116.59. Since the problem asks for the total amount in dollars and cents, and the answer is already in that format, we can conclude that the total amount of money they have is:

1. Determine the total number of students who received each grade:
   - 20 students received a grade of 80.
   - 8 students received a grade of 90.
   - 2 students received a grade of 100.

2. Calculate the total sum of the grades:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 4 \times 4 \) magic square such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 & \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 & \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 & \\
\hline
& & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum \( S \) by considering the first row:
\[
S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + x_1
\]
where \( x_1 \) is the missing number in the fourth column of the first row.

Next, let's consider the first column:
\[
S = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + x_2
\]
where \( x_2  \) is the missing number in the fourth row of the first column.

Since the sum \( S \) is the same for all rows, columns, and diagonals, we can set up equations based on these sums.

### Step 1: Sum of the first row
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + x_1 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
2n + 1 + x_1 = S
\]

### Step 2: Sum of the first column
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + x_2 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
2n + 1 + x_2 = S
\]

From the above two equations, we see that:
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]

### Step 3: Sum of the second row
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + x_3 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
3n - 6 + x_3 = S
\]

### Step 4: Sum of the second column
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n + x_ 4 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
3n - 6 + x_4 = S
\]

From the above two equations, we see that:
\[
x_3 = x_4
\]

### Step 5: Sum of the third row
\[
2 + n + (n-1) + x_5 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
2n + 1 + x_5 = S
\]

### Step 6: Sum of the third column
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) + x_6 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
2n + 1 + x_6 = S
\]

From the above two equations, we see that:
\[
x_5 = x_6
\]

### Step 7: Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) + x_7 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
4n - 13 + x_7 = S
\]

### Step 8: Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
\ [
(n+1) + (2n-9) + (n-1) + x_8 = S
\]
Simplify:
\[
4n - 7 + x_8 = S
\]

Since all sums are equal, we can set up equations to find \( S \).

### Step 9: Solve for \( S \)
From the first row:
\[
S = 2n + 1 + x_1
\]

From the second row:
\[
S = 3n - 6 + x_3
\]

Equate the two expressions for \( S \):
\[
2n + 1 + x_1 = 3n - 6 + x_3
\]
\[
x_1 - x_3 = n - 7
\]

Since \( x_1 = x_3 \), we have:
\[
0 = n - 7 \implies n = 7
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]```

1. **Jim's Travel Distance:**
   - Jim merge pe diagonala pizei readme pe care are 300 de deciare langle家i apotice i 400 de deciare lungime.
   - The diagonal distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \(d = \sqrt{(300)^2 + (400)^2}\).
   - \(d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500\).

"To solve the given problem, we start by using the fact that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other cube root of unity is \(\omega^2\), and we also have the property that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we will find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\ [
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Now, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). We expand this product:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

"To solve the problem of finding the shortest path that visits three given points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) or \(D\) and returns to the starting point, we need to consider the concept of a minimum spanning tree and the traveling Salesman problem (TSP). However, since we are asked for the shortest path that visits three points and returns to the starting point, we are essentially looking for the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph with four vertices (the starting point and the three given points).

The shortest path that visits three points and returns to the starting point is known as the traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for three points, which is a special case. The solution involves finding the minimum distance for a cycle that visits all three points and returns to the starting point.

Let's denote the starting point as \(P_0\) and the three other points as \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). The shortest path will be the one that minimizes the total distance traveled. This can be done by calculating the distance for all possible permutations of the three points and then choosing the one with the minimum total distance.

The possible permutations of the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are:
 1. \(P_0 \to A \to B \to C \to P_0\)
2. \(P_0 \to A \to C \to B \to P_0\)
3. \(P_0 \to B \to A \to C \to P_0\)
4. \(P_0 \to B \to C \to A \to P_0\)
5. \(P_0 \to C \to A \to B \to P_0\)
6. \(P_0 \to C \to B \to A \to P_0\)

We need to calculate the total distance for each of these paths and then choose the one with the minimum distance. If we denote the distances between the points as follows:
- \(d(P_0, A)\)
- \(d(P_0, B)\)
- \(d(P_0, C)\)
- \(d(A, B)\)
- \(d(A, C)\)
- \(d(B, C)\)

The total distance for each path would be:
1. \(d(P_0, A) + d(A, B) + d(B, C) + d(C, P_ 0)\)
2. \(d(P_0, A) + d(A, C) + d(C, B) + d(B, P_0)\)
3. \(d(P_0, B) + d(B, A) + d(A, C) + d(C, P_0)\)
4. \(d(P_0, B) + d(B, C) + d(C, A) + d(A, P_0)\)
5. \(d(P_0, C) + d(C, A) + d(A, B) + d(B, P_0)\)
6. \(d(P_0, C) + d(C, B) + d(B, A) + d(A, P_0)\)

The shortest path will be the one with the minimum of these six distances. Therefore, the shortest path that visits three points and returns to the starting point is the one with the minimum total distance among these six paths.

The answer is: \(\boxed{\text{The shortest path that visits three points and returns to the starting point}}\). The exact shortest path depend on the specific distances between the points, but the method to find it remains the same.","[Theshortestpaththatvisitsthreepoints;returnstothestartingpoint, '\\text{The shortest path that visits three points ; returns to the starting point}']",13,"[13, '13']",False
