"To determine the value of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

1. We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DE}\). Since \(EF = 7\) and the hypotenuse is \(DE\), we can write:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
   \]
2. To find \(DE\), we solve the equation for \(DE\):
   \[
   DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

Thus, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).\\

The value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\). This is obtained by using the definition of the sine function in a right triangle and solving for the unknown side length.","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To solve for \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians (or 45 degrees) in the counterclockwise direction. Here are the steps to find \( w \):

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in terms of their real and imaginary parts:**
   \[
   z = x_1 + y_1 i = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = x_2 + y_2 i = 2 - 3i
   \]
   So, \( x_1 = 2 + \sqrt{2} \), \( y_1 = -(3 + 3 \sqrt{2}) \), \( x_2 = 2 \), and \( y_2 = -3 \).

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \ [
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (-(3 + 3 \sqrt{2}) + 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians:**
   The rotation by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians is represented by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
    \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate back:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).```\\

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root by taking out any perfect squares.

First, we factorize 242:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
So, 242 can be written as:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121:
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11 \]
So, 121 can be written as:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]

Now, we can simplify the square root:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a table with the condition that three specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of three specific people as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the group of three and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them in a circle is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange the three people within their block:**
   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate  the total number of distinct seating arrangements:**
   Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange the three people within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).```

"To find the term independent of \( x \) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we will use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \( a = 10x^3 \), \( b = -\frac{1}{2x^2} \), and \( n = 5 \). We need to find the term where the power of \( x \) is zero.

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k 
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k) - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

To find the term independent of \( x \), we set the exponent of \( x \) to zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \( k \):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \( k = 3 \) back into the general term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3  x^{15 - 5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Substitute the binomial coefficient and simplify:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

Thus, the term independent of \( x \) in the expansion is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given congruence \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that \( n \) can be written in the form \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find the remainder when the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \) is divided by 7. We can simplify this by first reducing each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

 So, the expression \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \) modulo 7 becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7. We do this by performing the division:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

Thus, the remainder is 3. Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is:

To determine the minimum number of degrees the pentagon can be turned to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center by certain angles and still look the same.

The angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself is given by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \). This is because a full rotation is 360 degrees, and since there are 5 equal sides and angles in a regular pentagon, we divide 360 by 5 to find the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position.

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon can be turned to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). We can choose any pair of diagonals to find the midpoint. Let's consider the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
 \]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the other diagonal pair \(AD\) and \(BC\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(BC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \ frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3 + y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

The final answer is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \]

First, we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

So, the function becomes:

\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)} \]

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which happens at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so  the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to find the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2  & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \), we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.

The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16}  = 4 \). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4, and the smallest \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity, which means \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, we note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Thus, the expression becomes :

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

1. Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) and \(18_9\) to base 10

#### Converting \(58_9\) to base 10:

Calculating each term:

Adding these together:
\[

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

#### Converting \(18_9\) to base 10:
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:

\]
Calculating  each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 2: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 3: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]
So, \(36_{10}\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall the definition of the secant function:
\[
\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}
\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) in the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\).

Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
 \]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity:
\[
1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x
\]

Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall the definition of the cotangent function:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x

Thus, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"To determine how many treeks are equal in length to one squig, we need to break down the information given and set up an equation.

1. We know that three squigs are equal in length to one goolee.
2. We also know that two treeks are equal in length to one goolee.

Let's denote the length of one squig as \( S \) and the length of one treek as \( T \). From the information given, we can write the following equations:
\[ 3S = 1G \]
\[ 2T = 1G \]

Since \( 3S = 1G \) and \( 1G = 2T \), we can substitute \( 2T \) for \( 1G \) in the first equation:
\[ 3S = 2T \]

To find the relationship between \( S \) and \( T \), we can solve for \( S \) in terms of \( T \):
\[ S = \frac{2T}{3} \]

Now, we need to find out how many treeks are equal in length to one squig. Since \( S = \frac{2T}{3} \), we can express  one squig in terms of treeks:
\[ 1S = \frac{2T}{3} \]

To find out how many treeks are equal to one squig, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[ 1S = \frac{2T}{3} \implies 1S = \frac{3}{2}T \]

Therefore, one squig is equal in length to \(\frac{3}{2}\) treeks. To find out how many treeks are equal to one squig, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[ 1S = \frac{3}{2}T \implies 1S = \frac{3}{2}T \]

So, the number of treeks equal in length to one squig is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{2}} \]```


The final answer is \( \boxed{\frac{3}{2}} \). This means that one squig is equal in length to \(\frac{3}{2}\) treeks. To verify, we can check the consistency with the given information:

"To determine the value of \(a + b\), we start by examining the given polynomials and their product. The product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is given as \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, let's expand the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will expand this step by step, focusing on the coefficients of each power of \(t\).

1. **\(t^4\) term:**
   \[
   3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
   \]

2. **\(t^3\) term:**
   \[
   3t^2 \cdot bt + 5t \cdot 4t^2 = 3bt^3 + 20t^3 = (3b + 20)t^3
   \]

3. **\(t^2\) term:**
    \[
   3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot bt + a \cdot 4t^2 = -6t^2 + 5bt^2 + 4at^2 = (5b + 4a - 6)t^2

4. **\(t\) term:**
   \[
   5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot bt = -10t + abt = (-10 + ab)t
   \]

5. **constant term:**
   \[
   a \cdot (-2) = -2a
   \]

Now, we equate the coefficients from the expanded form to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

From the \(t^4\) term:
\[
12 = 12 \quad \text{(This is already satisfied)}
\]

From the \(t^3\) term:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Solving for \(b\):
\[
3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\ ]

From the \(t^2\) term:
\[
5b + 4a - 6 = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
5(2) + 4a - 6 = -8
\]
\[
10 + 4a - 6 = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4a = -12 \implies a = -3

From the \(t\) term:
\[
-10 + ab = -16

Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

\[
-10 - 6 = -16 \quad \text{(This is satisfied)}

From the constant term:
\[

Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tanque, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Identify the rate of water flow and the rate of water level rise:**
   - The tanque is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\)升 per minute.
   - The water level rises at a rate of 2 cm per minute.

2. **Convert the rate of water flow to cm\(^3\)/min:**
   - Since 1 liter = 1000 cm\(^3\), the rate of water flow in cm\(^3\)/min is:
     \[
     20\pi \text{ liters/min} = 20\pi \times 1000 \text{ cm}^3/\text{min} = 20000\pi \text{ cm}^3/\text{min}
     \]

3. **Relate the rate of water flow to the dimensions of the tanque:**
   - The volume of water added per minute is the product of the cross-sectional area of the tanque and the rate of water level rise.
   - Let the radius of the tanque be \(r\) cm . The cross-sectional area of the tanque is \(\pi r^2\) cm\(^2\).
   - The rate of water level rise is 2 cm/min, so the volume of water added per minute is:
     \[
     \pi r^2 \times 2 = 2\pi r^2 \text{ cm}^3/\text{min}
     \]
   - We know this volume is equal to \(20000\pi\) cm\(^3/\min\), so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2\pi r^2 = 20000\pi
     \]

4. **Solve for the radius \(r\):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by \(2\pi\):
     \[
     r^2 = 10000
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{10000} = 100

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \( f(x) \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{se } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{se } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \( x \geq a \)
For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). The vertex of the parabola is at \( x = 0 \), but since we are only considering \( x \geq a \), the function is increasing for \( x \geq a \).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \( x < a \)
For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This  is a linear function with a slope of \( a \). If \( a > 0 \), the function is increasing. If \( a < 0 \), the function is decreasing. If \( a = 0 \), the function is constant.

### Step 3: Determine the continuity and intersection of horizontal lines
For the graph of \( y = f(x) \) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the function must be continuous at \( x = a \). This means that the value of the function from the left side of \( x = a \) must equal the value of the function from the right side of \( x = a \).

The value of the function at \( x = a \) from the left side is:
\[
f(a^-) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]
The value of the function at \( x = a \) from the right side is:
\[
f(a^+) = a(a)^2 = a^3.
\]
For the function to be continuous at \( x = a \), we need:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
 \[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]
Factoring out \( a \), we get:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]
This gives us the solutions:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.
\]
Since \( a \) must be positive for the parabola to open upwards and for the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once, we discard \( a = 0 \) and \( a = -1 \). Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) is:
\[
a = 2.
\]

### Conclusion
The largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).```

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the given equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

1. **Complete the square for the \(x\) terms:**
   \[
   x^2 - 10x
   \]
   To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25
   \]

2. **Complete the square for the \(y\) terms:**
    \[
   y^2 + 6y
   \]
   To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
   \[
   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9
   \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[
x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
\]
\[
(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
\]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right side of  the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\):
\[
34 - c = 1
\]
Solve for \(c\):
\[
c = 34 - 1
\]
\[
c = 33

Thus, the value of \(c\) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1-x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1-x) = x.
\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions: \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1\),  which simplifies to \(1 \leq \lambda \leq \infty\). Since \(\lambda\) is restricted to the interval \([0,4]\), we have \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\).

Next, we need to check if there are any values of \(\lambda\) in the intervals \([0,1)\) and \((4,4]\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

We start by computing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1-x)) = \lambda \lambda x(1-x)(1 - \lambda x(1-x)) = \lambda^2 x(1-x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1-x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), then \(f(f(x)) = x\)  is trivially satisfied. So, we need to find non-trivial solutions in the interval \((0,1)\). For \(x \in (0,1)\), we can divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To have non-trivial solutions, we need to check the behavior of the function. For \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), we get:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4},
\]
and
\[
f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \frac{\lambda}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right ) = \frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16}.
\]
We need this to equal \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16} = \frac{1}{2} \implies \lambda^2 (4 - \lambda) = 8 \implies \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0.
\]
We solve this cubic equation. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\). Testing \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0.
\]
So, \(\lambda = 2\) is a root. For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1-x),
\]
and
\[
f(f(x)) = 2 \cdot 2x(1-x)(1 - 2x(1-x)) = 4x(1-x )(1 - 2x + 2x^2).
\]
If \(x = \frac{1}{2}\),
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2},
\]
and
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
So \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function \(f(x) = 2x(1-x)\) has a fixed point at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(f(f(x)) = x\) is satisfied. Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False
"To find the measure of the smaller positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression inside the tangent function. The given expression is:

\]

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin  B = \sin (A - B)
\]

Using these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator of the given expression. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
\[
= (\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
\[
= \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ)
\]
\[
= \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
\[
= \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ \quad \text{(since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\))}
\]

 Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
\[
= (\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
\[
= \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ)
\]
\[
= \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
\[
= \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ \quad \text{(since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\))}
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin  5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). This simplifies further to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin  85^\circ}
\]

Recognizing that \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \tan 15^\circ

"To determine the number of distinct license plates consisting of the letters in the word "" Ellipse"", we need to consider the following:

1. The word "" Ellipse "" consists of 8 distinct letters.
2. A license plate is a sequence of these letters.
3. Since the problem does not specify the length of the license plate, we will assume the license plate can be any length from 1 to 8 letters.

The number of distinct license plates of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 8 \)) is given by the number of permutations of 8 distinct letters taken \( n \) at a time, which is \( P(8, n) = \frac{8!}{(8-n)!} \).

To find the total number of distinct license plates, we sum the number of permutations for each possible length from 1 to 8:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{8} P(8, n) = P(8, 1) + P(8, 2) + P(8, 3) + P(8, 4) + P(8, 5) + P(8, 6) + P( 8, 7) + P(8, 8)

Calculating each term:

\[
P(8, 1) = \frac{8!}{7!} = 8
\]
\[
P(8, 2) = \frac{8!}{6!} = 8 \times 7 = 56
\]
\[
P(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{5!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336

\[
P(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{4!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 1680

\[
P(8, 5) = \frac{8!}{3!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 6720

\[
P(8, 6) = \frac{8!}{2!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 = 20160

\[
P(8, 7) = \frac{8!}{1!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 40320

"To find the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to determine how many times the number 10 is a factor in \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the following formula to count the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime number 5, we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cd ots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., 625, 3125, etc.) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]
Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will first analyze the function and then use calculus to find critical points.

1. **域分析**:
   Both \( x \) and \( y \) are within the interval \([-1, 1]\). Therefore, the expressions \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are real and non-negative.

2. **Symmetry**:
   Notice that \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric with respect to the line \( x = y \). This suggests that we might find the maximum value on the line \( x = y \).

3. **Substitute \( x = y \)**:
   Let \( x = y \). Then the function simplifies to:
   \[
   f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]

 4. **Maximize \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)**:
   Define \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To find the maximum value of \( g(x) \), we take its derivative and set it to zero.

   \[
   g'(x) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right)
   \]

   Set \( g'(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   2 \left( \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt {1 - x^2}} \right) = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

 5. **Evaluate \( g(x) \) at critical points and endpoints**:
   \[
   g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 1
    \]
   \[
   g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -1

   \[
   g(1) = 2(1) \sqrt{1 - 1} = 0
   \]
   \[
   g(-1) = 2(-1) \sqrt{1 - 1} = 0
   \]

Thus, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 1 \).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\). The maximum value of \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is \(\boxed{1}\).} .} } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } }","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by those vectors, and the area of the triangle is half of that.

First, let's find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we get :
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}
 \]
\[
= \sqrt{180}
\]
\[
= 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Since the area of the triangle is half the area of the parallelogram, we have:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle OAB = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
= 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).```

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), so the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Recognizing that \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), it follows that \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[  z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( 2\cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine the value of \( \theta \). The value of \( \cos\theta \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), which is a specific value that can be related to the golden ratio. The golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and we can express \( \cos\theta \) in terms of \( \phi \):

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Noting the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function, we can use the fact that \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will give us a specific angle  whose cosine we can easily determine. Given the symmetry and periodicity of the cosine function, we can deduce that \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will be equivalent to \( \theta \) itself or its reflection, leading to:

\[ 2\cos(85\theta) = 2\cos\theta = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \( G \) of a triangle and the areas of the triangles formed by the centroid and the sides of the triangle.

1. **Centroid and Medians**: The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( G \) is located at \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \text{ of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side} \right) \).

2. **Area Division by Medians**: The medians of a triangle divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Since the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, each of these smaller triangles has an area of \( \frac{144}{6} = 24 \).

3. **Triangle \( GMN \)**: The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). This line forms similar triangles with \( ABC \). Specifically, triangle \( GMN \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \)  with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{3} \) (since \( G \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the way from \( A \) to \( D \), and \( M \) and \( N \) are on \( AB \) and \( AC \) respectively, each \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the way from \( A \) to the midpoints of \( BC \)).

4. **Area Calculation**: The area of a similar triangle is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio. Therefore, the area of triangle \( GMN \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 \) times the area of triangle \( ABC \). This gives us:
   \[

\[ p + 5n + 10d = 75 \]

Since we are only asked to find the number of nickels, we need to find a combination of \( p \), \( n \), and \( d \) that satisfies this equation. One approach is to consider different values for \( d \) and see if we can find corresponding values for \( p \) and \( n \) that are non-negative integers.

Let's start with \( d = 7 \) (the maximum number of dimes possible since \( 10 \times 7 = 70 \), leaving 5 cents for the remaining coins):

\[ p + 5n + 10 \times 7 =  75 \]
\[ p + 5n + 70 = 75 \]
\[ p + 5n = 5 \]

Now, we need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( p \) and \( n \). If \( n = 1 \):

\[ p + 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
\[ p + 5 = 5 \]
\[ p = 0 \]

So, one solution is \( p = 0 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( d = 7 \). This means there is 1 nickel. To confirm, let's check the total value:

\[ 0 \text{ pennies} + 1 \text{ nickel} + 7 \text{ dimes} = 0 + 5 + 70 = 75 \text{ cents} \]

This solution works. Therefore, the number of nickels is \(\boxed{1}\).\\

The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\).\\

1. **Understand the problem**: We need a number that is a multiple of 450 and is composed only of the digits 0 and 1. A number is a multiple of 450 if and only if it is a multiple of both 9 and 50.

2. **Check for divisibility by 50**: A number is divisible by 50 if its last two digits are 00. Therefore, our number must end in 00.

3. **Check for divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Since our number is composed only of the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits is simply the number of 1's in the number.

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we will use several trigonometric identities and properties.

First, we can use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression. This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), and \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\ ]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 60^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2}, \quad \sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 -  \cos 160^\circ}{2}
\]

Since \(\cos 120^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos 160^\circ = -\cos 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin^2 60^\circ = \frac{1 - (-\frac{1}{2})}{2} = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2}\right)
\]

Using \(\cos 160^\circ = -\cos 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 - (-\cos 20^\circ)}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ }{2}
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \left(\frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\right)
\]

We know that \(\cos 40^\circ = 2 \cos^2 20^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos 80^\circ = 2 \cos^2 40^\circ - 1\), but we can use a known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 4\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}
\]

Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

\[
 \boxed{\frac{3}{64}}

First, recall that the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is given by:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Now, let's consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), i.e., \( f(x+5) =  0 \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( y \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( x = y - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is therefore:

(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles. Let's denote the expression by \(E\).

First, recall the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\). This will help us rewrite some of the terms in a more convenient form.

We start with the first term \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\). This term is already in a simple form.

Next, consider the term \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}\). Using the identity \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), we can rewrite this term as \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ}\).

Finally, for the term \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we leave it as is for now.

Now, we have:
\[E = \frac{1 }{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.\]

We will use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to express \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 140^\circ\), but it is already in a simple form for our purposes.

To proceed, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity to the first and second terms, we get:
\[\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,\]
\[\frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ.\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[E = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + \frac{1}{\sin^2  40^\circ}.\]

Next, we use the identity \(\tan(90^\circ - x) = \cot x\). This tells us that \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), and since \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we have \(\tan 70^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\).

However, we can also use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). Applying this identity to the third term, we get:
\[\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[E = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).\]

We know that \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\).  Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[E = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + 1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.\]

Combining the constant terms, we get:
\[E = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.\]

To find the value of this expression, we use a known trigonometric identity which states that for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + B + C = 90^\circ\), the sum \(\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C + 2 \tan A \tan B \tan C = 1\). Here, we have \(10^\circ + 20^\circ + 60^\circ = 90^\circ\), but we can use the identity in a different form.

However, a simpler approach is to use  the known result that for the specific angles involved, the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the trigonometric functions of these angles is 9. Therefore, we have:
\[E = 9.\]

Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{9}\).]}}

Since \( x \) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \( 180^\circ \). We need to find an integer \( n \) such that the above equation holds true and \( x \) is a valid interior angle.

First, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 180(n-2) - 1070
\ ]

To ensure \( x \) is a valid interior angle, it must satisfy \( 0 < x < 180 \). Therefore, we need:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

Let's solve the inequalities separately. First, solve \( 0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 \):

\[
180(n-2) > 1070
\]

\[
n-2 > \frac{1070}{180}
\]

\[
n-2 > 5.9444
\]

\[
n > 7.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \geq 8
\]

Next, solve \( 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180 \):

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

\[
n-2 < 6.944 4
\]

\[
n < 8.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \leq 8
\]

Combining both inequalities, we find:

\[
n = 8
\]

Now, we verify if \( n = 8 \) satisfies the original condition. If \( n = 8 \), the sum of all interior angles is:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^\circ
\]

The sum of all but one of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \), so the missing angle \( x \) is:

\[
x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
\]

Since \( 10^\circ \) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]```python

"To solve for the number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find \( t \) such that \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means:
   \[
   t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. **Set up the congruence**: We need to solve the congruence:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Rearrange the equation**: Subtract 1 from both sides to set the equation to 0:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic congruence**: We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \ ). The general form of a quadratic equation is \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \).

5. **Use the quadratic formula**: The quadratic formula for solving \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{p}
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \):
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square root:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{ 8}}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]

6. **Simplify the square root**: We need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We test values to find \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \):
   \[
   1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

   \[
   2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}

   \[
   3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}

   \[
   10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
   \]
   We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \).

7. **Substitute back into the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \pmod{23}
   \]

8. **Calculate the two possible values for \( t \)**:
   \[
   t_1 \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
   \]
   \[
   t_2 \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
    \]

9. **Verify the solutions**: Check if both \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

   For \( t_1 = 4 \):
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]
   Check if 6 is the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23:
   \[
   4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]
   So, \( t_1 = 4 \) is a solution.

   For \( t_2 = 17 \):
   \[
   17 + 2 = 19
   \]
   Check if 19 is the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23:
   \[
   17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]
   So, \( t_2 = 17 \) is also a solution.

Therefore, the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \ The final answer is :

"To determine the surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic unit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:

   V = s^3
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic unit, we can set up the equation:

   Solving for \(s\), we take the cube root of both sides:

   So, the side length of the cube is \(1\) unit.

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2
   \]
   Since we have determined that \(s = 1\), we substitute \(1\) for \(s\) in the formula:
   \[

   Therefore, the surface area of the cube is \(6\) square units.

Next, we calculate the product of the number and its conjugate:

This expression is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we first need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(\theta\) is an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Since \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\), we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Let \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), so \(\tan(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle whose tangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} -  \phi\).

Now, we can rewrite the original equation as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

and the second line is defined by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, we check if the direction vectors are parallel. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We see that:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end {pmatrix}.
\]

This shows that the direction vectors are parallel, so the two lines are either parallel or they intersect. To check if they intersect, we set the parametric equations equal to each other and solve for \(t\) and \(u\):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.

This gives us the system of equations:

\[

\]
\[
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u,
\]
\[
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u.
\]

We solve the first equation for \(t\):

\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t = -8 + 4u \implies t = -4 + 2u.
\ ]

We substitute \(t = -4 + 2u\) into the second equation:

\[
-10 - 9(-4 + 2u) = -3 - 18u \implies -10 + 36 - 18u = -3 - 18u \implies 26 = -3,
\]

which is a contradiction. Therefore, the lines do not intersect and are parallel.

To find the distance between two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between a point on one line and the other line. We can take the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line. The vector from the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) to the point \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \ end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The distance is the absolute value of the projection of this vector onto the normal vector of the second line's direction. The normal vector can be taken as \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). The distance formula is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left| \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right|}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{\left| -8 \cdot 2 + 7 \cdot (-9) + 5 \cdot (-2) \right|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2}} = \frac{\left| -16 - 63 - 10 \right|}{\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4}} =  \frac{89}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{89}.

Therefore, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{\sqrt{89}}\).``````

\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c } = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

We are given the following cross products:

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).  Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

Now, we compute each term:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

\[

"To solve for the area of \(\triangle ACD\) in the given trapezoid \(ABCD\) with the conditions that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Geometry and Relationships:**
   Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Also, \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), which implies that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\).

2. **Use the Area Formula for Trapezoids:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
   \]
   where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is the same as the  length of \(\overline{AC}\) since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\).

3. **Express the Area in Terms of the Segments:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
   \[
   [ABCD] = [ACD] + [ABC]
   \]
   Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles, we can write:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC
   \]
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (AD + BC)
   \]
   Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (AD + BC)
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 2,  we get:
   \[
   84 = AC \times (AD + BC)
   \]

4. **Area of \(\triangle ACD\):**
   The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC
   \]
   Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height and bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC
   \]
   and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC
   \]
   The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is 42, and since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) is the height and bisects \(\angle BAD\).

 Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\boxed{21}\).```

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fractions:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation definition to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p) \left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, we have \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). So, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation definition:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10) \left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators and the fraction:

\[
(7)(10) \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

 Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \cdot \frac{7}{10}
\]

We can simplify this by dividing 70 by 10 and then multiplying by 7:

\[
70 \cdot \frac{7}{10} = 7 \cdot 7 = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen independently and randomly on a circle, we can use geometric and combinatorial reasoning.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to choose the four points on the circle. Since the points are chosen independently and randomly, the total number of possible configurations of the points is simply the number of ways to arrange 4 points in a circle, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial) divided by 4 (since rotating the circle does not create a new configuration). Thus, there are \(3! = 6\) distinct ways to arrange 4 points on a circle.

Next, we need to determine how many of these configurations result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. For two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points is separated by the other pair when moving around the circle. This means that if we label the points in the order they appear on the circle as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), the segments will intersect.  There are exactly 2 such configurations out of the 6 possible configurations.

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable configurations divided by the total number of configurations:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with radii 1 and 2, where the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2.
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

4. **Determine the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   Let the angle \(\angle ADC\) be \(\theta\) (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta

5. **Determine the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:

6. **Set up the equation for the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is the difference between the area of the sector of the larger circle and the area of the sector of the smaller circle.

7. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   Combine  the terms on the left-hand side:

   2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}

"To determine how many bottles of water are needed to fill a spherical fish tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the bottle and the fish tank and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the bottle's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical fish tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the fish tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in the value, we get:
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3
\]
Calculating \( 6^3 \):
\[
6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
\]
So, the volume of the fish tank is:
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = \frac{864}{3} \pi = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cent imeters}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one bottle of water. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the bottle, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:
\[
V_{\text{bottle}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \times 9 \times 8 = 72 \pi \text{ cubic centimeters}

To find out how many bottles are needed to fill the fish tank, we divide the volume of the fish tank by the volume of one bottle:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the arcsine function.

Let's denote:
\[
\alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \arcsin 0.5
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\sin \alpha = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = 0.5
\]

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Next, we need to determine \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\ ). Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles whose sines are known, we can find their cosines using the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - (0.4)^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Similarly,
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and  \(\cos \beta\) into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\ sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now, we multiply \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right)
\]

Using the difference of squares:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = 2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - \sqrt{21} \cdot 2\sqrt{3}
\]
\[
= 2\sqrt{63} - 12 + 21 - 2\sqrt{63} = 21 - 12 = 9

 Thus,

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomit_do Sen horizontal with 5 members, including at least one member of each of the two groups (8 members of the first group and 6 members of the second group), we can use the principle of complementary counting.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one of the groups is not represented. There are two cases to consider:
1. All 5 members are from the first group of 8 members.
2. All 5 members are from the second group of 6 members.

 For the first case, the number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6

The total number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one group is not represented is the sum of the two cases:

\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
 \]

Now, solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solve these two equations for \(x\):
\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 66
\]
\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we select \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"To find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2  \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

We now need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). To do this, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in a geometric progression. Specifically, we use the fact that for \(n = 2^k\), the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2 times \(\frac{\pi}{2^n}\) up to \(\frac{\pi}{2^n}\) is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2^k \pi}{2^n} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.
\]

 In our case, \(n = 4\) and the product is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Thus, the original expression evaluates to:

\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8}.
\]

Therefore, the value is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{8}}.

10. **Determine the value  of $y$:**
    - Since $b^2 = \frac{1 - 4y^3 + 3y}{1 + 4y^3 - 3y}$, we need to find $y$ such that the equation holds true.

"To determine the median of a sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sum of the sequence:**
   The sum of the sequence is given as \(3^7\). We know that \(3^7 = 2187\).

2. **Determine the number of terms:**
   The sequence consists of 27 consecutive integers.

3. **Find the median of the sequence:**
   Since the sequence has an odd number of terms (27), the median will be the middle term. The middle term of a sequence of 27 terms is the 14th term.

4. **Express the sequence in terms of its first term:**
   Let the first term of the sequence be \(a\). The sequence can be written as:
   \[
   a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26
   \]

5. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms }
   \]
   The average of the terms in this sequence is the average of the first and last terms:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{a + (a+26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13

   Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:

6. **Solve for the first term \(a\):**
   \[
   27(a + 13) = 2187

   Divide both sides by 27:
   \[
   a + 13 = 81
   \]
   Subtract 13 from both sides:
   \[
   a = 68
   \]

7. **Find the median:**
   The median is the 14th term of the sequence, which is:
   \[
   a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

"To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) and find the range of \( x \) such that the inequality holds.

First, observe that \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares. Therefore, \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \). This means the left part of the inequality, \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\), is always true because \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) is greater than \(-4\).

Next, we need to solve the right part of the inequality, \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \). Let's set \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \). We can rewrite this as a standard quadratic inequality:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.  \]

To solve this inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \), we get:

\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7. \]

Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard the negative root.  Therefore, the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is satisfied for \( 0 \leq y < 3 \). Substituting back \( y = x^2 \), we get:

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]

This implies:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[ \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}. \]```

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by analyzing the given equations. We have:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy -  yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Let's denote \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Next, we consider the third equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[
xy(y+x) + xz(z+x) + yz(z+y) = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z).
\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz ) - 3xyz = sp - 12.
\]
Since we know \(xyz = 4\), we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]
Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:

"To determine which series has a number of passageways for men that is closer to 135% of the number of passageways for women, we need to calculate the actual number of passageways for each series and compare them to 135% of the number of passageways for women.

Let's start with the $9^{\text{th}}$ series:
- For men: \(41.1\%\) of 300 = \(0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
- For women: \(39.4\%\) of 300 = \(0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
- 135% of the number of passageways for women = \(1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.37\)
- The difference between the number of passageways for men and 135% of the number of passageways for women = \(159.37 - 123.3 = 36.07\)

Next, let's calculate for the $10^{\text{ th}}$ series:
- For men: \(34.4\%\) of 300 = \(0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
- For women: \(33.1\%\) of 300 = \(0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
- 135% of the number of passagways for women = \(1.35 \times 99.3 = 133.755\)
- The difference between the number of passagways for men and 135% of the number of passagways for women = \(133.755 - 103.2 = 30.555\)

Next, let's calculate for the $11^{\text{th}}$ series:
- For men: \(20.6\%\) of 300 = \(0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
- For women: \(13.8\%\) of 300 = \(0.138 \ times 300 = 41.4\)
- 135% of the number of passagways for women = \(1.35 \times 41.4 = 55.71\)
- The difference between the number of passagways for men and 135% of the number of passagways for women = \(61.8 - 55.71 = 6.09\)

Finally, let's calculate for the $12^{\text{th}}$ series:
- For men: \(11.6\%\) of 300 = \(0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
- For women: \(8.6\%\) of 300 = \(0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
- 135% of the number of passagways for women = \(1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83\)
- The difference between the number of passagways for men and 135% of the number of passagways for women  = \(34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03\)

The smallest difference is for the $12^{\text{th}}$ series, which is 0.03. Therefore, the series with the number of passagways for men that is closest to 135% of the number of passagways for women is the $12^{\text{th}}$ series.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|,\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]

Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined. These points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval .

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|-19 \cdot -1|}{-10 \cdot -46} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So the expression is positive in \((- \infty, -9)\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|-10 \cdot 8|}{-1 \cdot -37} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So the expression is positive in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)}  = \frac{|-8 \cdot 10|}{1 \cdot -35} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So the expression is negative in \((0, 9)\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's choose \(x = 20\):
\[
\frac{|(20-9)(20+9)|}{20(20-36)} = \frac{|11 \cdot 29|}{20 \cdot -16} = \frac{319}{-320} < 0.
\]
So the expression is negative in \((9, 36)\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's choose \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|31 \cdot 49|}{40 \cdot 4} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]
So the expression is positive in  \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider where the expression is undefined. The expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

Combining all this information, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative, excluding the points where it is undefined:

" 给定直角三角形 \(\triangle RST\)，其中 \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)，我们知道 \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\)。我们需要找到 \(\sin T\)。

首先，回想在直角三角形中，一个角的正弦值是其对边长度与斜边长度的比值。这里，\(\sin R = \frac{\text{对边}}{\text{斜边}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}\)。这意味着如果 \(ST = 2k\)，那么 \(RT = 5k\)，对于某个正数常量 \(k\)。

接下来，我们使用勾股定理来找到边 \(RS\) 的长度：
\[
RS = \sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}.
\]

现在，我们需要找到 \(\sin T\)。在 \(\triangle RST\) 中，\(\angle T\) 的对 边是 \(RS\)，而斜边仍然是 \(RT\)。因此，
\[
\sin T = \frac{\text{对边}}{\text{斜边}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}.

因此，\(\sin T\) 的值是 \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\)。\\

"To determine the minimum distance from the point \((0, 0)\) to the curve given by the equation \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we need to minimize the distance function \(d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Substituting the expression for \(y\) from the equation of the curve, we get:

\[d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}.\]

Let \(f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\). To find the minimum value of \(f(x)\), we take the derivative and set it to zero:

\[f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2 }x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}.\]

Taking the derivative of \(f(x)\):

\[f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2).\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us the critical points:

\[2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = \pm\sqrt{2}.\]

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

\[f(0) = \frac{9}{2},\]
\[f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2},\]
\[f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2 -  3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.\]

This distance can be expressed as \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a = 10\) is not divisible by the square of any prime number larger than 1, we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \).

1. **Solve \( f(x) = 0 \):**

   We need to consider both cases of the piecewise function.

   - For \( x \leq 3 \):
     \[
     f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
     \]
     Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

   - For \( x > 3 \):
     \[
     f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
     \]
     We solve the cubic equation:
     \[
     -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
     \]
     Factor out \( x \):
     \[
     x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
     \ ]
     This gives us:
     \[
     x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
     \]
     Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
     \[
     -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
     \]
     Multiply by \(-1\):
     \[
     x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
     \]
     Factor the quadratic:
     \[
     (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
     \]
     This gives us:
     \[
     x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
     \]
     Since \( x > 3 \), neither \( x = 3 \) nor \( x = -1 \) are valid solutions.

   Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Hence, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6)  \).

2. **Solve \( f(x) = 6 \):**

   Again, we consider both cases of the piecewise function.

   - For \( x \leq 3 \):
     \[
     f(x) = 3 - x = 6
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
     \]
     Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

   - For \( x > 3 \):
     \[
     f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
     \]
     We solve the cubic equation:
     \[
     -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
     \]
     This is a more complex equation to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

   Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3  \). Hence, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we add the two inverse values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]``` 

This is the final answer. The function \( f \) is defined piecewise, and we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). By solving these equations, we determine \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \) and \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \). Adding these values gives us the final answer of \( \boxed{0} \).

It requires careful consideration of each piece of the function and the correct application of algebraic techniques.

"Given that the distances from a point \(P\) to five of the vertices of a regular octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form one set of vertices and \(E, F, G, H\) form the other set, with each vertex in one set connected to each vertex in the other set.

Since the octahedron is regular, the distances between the vertices in the same set are all equal, and the distances between vertices in different sets are also equal. Let's denote the side length of the octahedron as \(s\). The distance between any two vertices in the same set is \(s\), and the distance between any two vertices in different sets is \(\sqrt{2}s\).

Assume without loss of generality that the distances from \(P\) to \(A, B, C, D, E\) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively.  We need to determine the distance from \(P\) to \(F\). Let's denote this distance as \(x\).

Since the octahedron is symmetric, the distances from \(P\) to the vertices in the other set must be the same as the distances to the vertices in the first set, just in a different order. Therefore, the distances from \(P\) to the vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) must be a permutation of the set \(\{3, 7, 8, 9, 11, x\}\).

The sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all vertices of the octahedron is a constant, because the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is the same. This constant is given by \(4s^2 + 4(\sqrt{2}s)^2 = 4s^2 + 8s^2 = 12s^2\).

Thus, we have:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 12s^2\]
 \[9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 12s^2\]
\[324 + x^2 = 12s^2\]
\[x^2 = 12s^2 - 324\]

We know that the distance between any two vertices in different sets is \(\sqrt{2}s\), so the only possible value for \(x\) that fits the pattern of the other distances is 10. This is because the distances must be the same set of numbers but in a different order, and the only number that fits the pattern is 10.

Therefore, the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{10}\).角落 are not necessary for the final answer.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the ac الفل of Jen's bezeira to Jack's bezeira. Let's start by identifying the given information and the relationship between the mass and the force ( force = mass × acelintersection).

1. The mass of a ball of softball is 200 grams.
2. The mass of a bezeira is 150 grams.
3. Jen's ball of bezeira has the same force as Jack's ball of bezeira.

First, let's calculate the force exerted by Jack's ball of bezeira:
\[ \text{Force}_{\text{Jack}} = \text{mass}_{\text{Jack}} \times \text{Hell intersection}_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \, \text{g} \times \text{-force per gram} \]

Since the force is the same for both Jen's and Jack's balls of bezeira, we can write:
\[ \text{Force}_{\text{Jen}} = \text{force}_{\text{Jack}} \]
\[ \text{force}_{\text{Jen}} = \text{mass}_{\text{Jen}}  \times \text{-force per gram} = 200 \, \text{g} \times \text{-force per gram} \]

Since the force is the same for both, we can equate the two expressions for force:
\[ 150 \, \text{g} \times \text{-force per gram} = 200 \, \text{g} \times \text{-force per gram} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 150 = 200 \times \frac{\text{force per gram}_{\text{Jen}}}{\text{-force per gram}_{\text{Jack}}} \]

Solving for the ratio of the acelintersection of Jen's bezeira to Jack's bezeira:
\[ \frac{\text{force per gram}_{\text{Jen}}}{\text{-force per gram}_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acelintersection of Jen's bezeira to Jack's bezeira is:

"To determine the common digit between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to first convert \(629_{10}\) into both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and record the remainders.

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.

 \[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). The digits in both representations are:

2. Each brusas draws pages for each of the 5feiticeintas.
3. Additionally, each of the 5feiticeintas draws pages for each of the other 4feiticeintas.

First, we calculate the pages drawn by the brusas. Since each brusas draws pages for each of the 5feiticeintas, the total number of pages drawn by the brusas is:

\[
6 \text{ brusas} \times 5 \text{feiticeintas} = 30 \text{ pages}

Next, we calculate the pages drawn by thefeiticeintas. Each of the 5feiticeintas draws pages for each of the other 4feiticeintas. So, eachfeiticeintas draws:

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). We do this by subtracting \(y\) from both sides:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at the given values and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:

\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ se } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ se } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate each term one by one.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( 1.05 \) is \( 2 \ ). Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.70 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 6.70 \) is \( 6 \). Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \(  f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 4 \) is \( 4 \). Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:

\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).``````

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a magic square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the given magic square and identify the unknowns:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same.

### Step 1: Sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\ [
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
So, \( S = 3n - 6 \).

### Step 3: Sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Since the sum of each row must be the same, we equate the sums of the first and second rows:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Verification
To ensure our solution is correct, we should verify that the sums of the columns and the diagonals are also equal to \( S = 2n + 1 \) when \( n = 7 \).

#### Sum of the first column:
 \[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1 ) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all sums are equal to 15, our solution is verified.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).$$

"To determine how many more picients Jim camمزيدou compared to Martha, we need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular beam that Jim cam⋄ and the length of the rectangular beam that Martha camказан along its width.

First, let's calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular beam that Jim cam-through. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with width \(w\) and height \(h\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{w^2 + h^2} \]
Here, the width \(w\) is 400 pents and the height \(h\) is 300 pents. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \]
So, Jim cam前往 500 pents.

Next, let's calculate the length of the rectangular beam that Martha camHOLDER along its width. Since Martha cam hitting the beam  along its width, the length of the beam is simply its width, which is 400 pents.

Now, we need to find out how many more pents Jim camulus than Martha. We do this by subtracting the length of the beam that Martha camulus from the length of the beam that Jim camulus:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity, and the possible values for \(\omega\) are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\). These solutions are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. They satisfy the relations \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we simplify the individual terms in the expression. Using the relation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can express \(\omega^2\) as \(-1 - \omega\) and \(\omega\) as \(-1 - \omega^2\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the sum of fractions.

Consider the expression:
\ [
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Now, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2  + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Since \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the only non-real cube roots of unity, the value of the expression is always 1 regardless of which value \(\omega\) takes. Thus, the only value possible is:
\[
\boxed{1}.
