"In the given right triangle \(DEF\), we know that \(DE\) is the hypotenuse, \(DF\) is the side adjacent to angle \(D\), and \(EF\) is the side opposite to angle \(D\). We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and that \(EF = 7\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we can solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DE\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).\\

"To find the complex number \( w \), we need to perform a rotation of the complex number \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c \). Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate the translated complex number by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \(\theta\) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \(\theta  = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so we use \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
    \]

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:
\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}
\]```python
# Python code to verify the result
import cmath

# Define the complex numbers
z = 2 + cmath.sqrt(2) - (3 + 3*cmath.sqrt(2))*1j
c = 2 - 3j

# Translate z so that c is at the origin
translated_z = z - c

# Rotate by pi/4
rotated_z = translated_z * cmath.exp(1j * cmath.pi / 4)

# Translate back to the original position
w = rotated_z + c

# Print the result

```

The output of the Python code should be:
\[

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To find the value of \(\sqrt{242}\), we can simplify the expression by factoring 242 into its prime factors and then simplifying the square root.

First, we factorize 242:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 = 2 \times 11^2 \]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} \]

Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we can separate the square root:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} \]

Since \(\sqrt{11^2} = 11\), we have:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of different ways to form a team of 3 people from 8 people (where the order of selection does not matter), we need to use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose \( k \) people from \( n \) people is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 3 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3!5!}
\]

Next, we simplify the factorials. Recall that \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5! \). The \( 5! \) terms cancel out in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{3! \times 5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3!}
\]

 Now, we need to calculate \( 3! \):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{6} = 8 \times 7 = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of different ways to form a team of 3 people from 8 people is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2 }\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero (the constant term). Therefore, we set the exponent of \(x\) to zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Thus, the constant term in the expansion is:

"To prove that if \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), then \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).**

   Since \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we can replace \( n \) with \( 2 \) in the expression:
   \[
   n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
   \]

2. **Calculate the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}\).**

   Substitute the congruences we found:
    \[
   (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
   \]

3. **Simplify the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \) modulo 7.**

   First, calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
   \[
   4 \cdot 6 = 24
   \]
   Now, find \( 24 \pmod{7} \):
   \[
   24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
   \]

   Next, multiply this result by 1:
   \[
   3 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]

4. **Conclusion.**

   We have shown that:
   \[
   (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
   \]

    However, we need to verify the given statement that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\). 

   Since we have calculated that the product is congruent to 3 modulo 7, not 0, there seems to be an inconsistency or error in the original problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure no mistakes have been made.

   Revisiting the steps confirms that the product indeed simplifies to:
   \[
   4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
   \]

   Therefore, based on the calculations, the result is indeed:
   \[
   \boxed{3}

   If the problem's statement is correct, there might be a misunderstanding or a need for a different approach. However, based on the given steps, the product \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is not congruent to 0 modulo 7 when \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices: \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). We know that \(x > 7\).

First, let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

The midpoint of \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations:
 \[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means we need to consider the other diagonal, \(AD\) and \(BC\), and find the midpoint of \(AD\) and set it equal to the midpoint of \(BC\).

The midpoint of \(AD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of \(BC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
 \]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, \(x + y = 8 + 9 = 17\).

The value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{17}\).```

   - **Vertical Asymptotes:**
     vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero. Therefore, we solve:

     This is a quadratic equation. We solve it using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -14\):

     To find the horizontal asymptote, we examine the behavior of the function as \(x \to \infty\). For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:

     The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\).

The expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be seen as part of the expansion of \((100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1\). Let's expand and simplify this step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression:

Now, expand \((100 - 1)^2\):

First, let's denote the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The inequality can be written as \(\|A \bold{v}\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\). To find the smallest possible \( C \), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A \), which is the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A \bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|}\) for all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is equal to the maximum singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[  A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 \]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm  \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \]
So the eigenvalues are:
\[ \lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

The maximum eigenvalue is 16, so the maximum singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( C \) is 4.

Thus, the answer is:

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we note that since \(z^5 = 1\), it follows that \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\), \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\), and so on. Thus, we can rewrite the expression  as:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) and \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\]

**Step 2: Perform the subtraction in base 10. **

Now we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

**Step 3: Convert the result back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients for the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36, which is \(9^1 = 9\).

\[36 \div 9 = 4\]
So, the coefficient for \(9^1\) is 4. Now we have:
\[36 - 4 \cdot 9 = 36 - 36 = 0\]
Since the remainder is 0, the coefficient for \(9^0\) is 0.

Therefore, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40_9}
\]```


The final answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these terms into a single fraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, we can combine the fractions:

 \[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), which implies \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

This is the same as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squigve.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. On one treek, there are three squigves and one goolee (1 kg). This can be written as:
   \[
   T = 3S + 1
   \]
2. On two treeks, there are three squigves and two goolees (2 kg). This can be written as:
   \[
   2T = 3S + 2
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( T = 3S + 1 \)
2. \( 2T = 3S + 2 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2(3S + 1) = 3S + 2
\]
Expanding and simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
6S + 2 = 3S + 2
 \]
Subtracting \( 3S + 2 \) from both sides, we get:
\[
3S = 0
\]
So, \( S = 0 \). This means that the weight of one squigve is 0 kg. Substituting \( S = 0 \) back into the first equation, we get:
\[
T = 3(0) + 1 = 1
\]
So, the weight of one treek is 1 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many treeks there are if their total weight is equal to the weight of one squigve plus one squigve, which is 2 kg. Since the weight of one treek is 1 kg, the number of treeks \( n \) is:
\[
nT = 2
\]
Substituting \( T = 1 \), we get:
\[
n \cdot 1 = 2

So, \( n = 2 \).

Therefore, the number of treeks is \(\boxed{2}\).```

First, we expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms,  we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for the \(t\) term:

 \[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify these values with the other equations. For the \(t^3\) term:

\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]

For the \(t^2\) term:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

Both of these are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rise.

The volume of water added to the tank per unit time is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder, \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the water level rise. Here, the volume of water added per unit time is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water level rise is \( h \) meters.

The volume of water added per unit time can also be expressed as the product of the cross-sectional area of the tank and the rate at which the water level rises. The cross-sectional area of the tank is \( \pi r^2 \), and the rate at which the water level rises is the height \( h \) per unit time. Therefore, we have:

\[ \pi r^2 h = 20\pi \]

We can cancel the \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ r^2 h = 20 \]

To find the radius \( r \),  we need to know the height \( h \). However, the problem does not specify the height, but it tells us that the tank dotes when the water level rises by a certain height. Since the problem asks for the radius in terms of the height, we can express the radius as:

\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{h} \]

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a). \]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\ ):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

We can rearrange this equation to:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since \(a\) must be a positive number (as the problem context implies a positive \(a\)), we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\). Therefore, the only positive solution is:

"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) such that the circle has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation. The standard form is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Now for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square,  we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

We know that the equation of a circle in standard form is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), and we are given that the radius \( r \) is 1. Therefore, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]

1. **Find the fixed points of \(f(x)\):**
   A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\). Therefore, we solve:
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) = x
   \]
   This equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0
   \]
   So, the solutions are:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0
   \]
   Solving the second equation for \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}
   \]
   Thus, the fixed points are:
    \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}
   \]

2. **Determine when \(f(f(x)) = x\):**
   We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). First, compute \(f(f(x))\):
   \[
   f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x))

   Simplify the expression inside the function:
   \[
   \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)

   We need this to equal \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x

   For \(x \neq 0\),  we can divide both sides by \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1
   \]

3. **Analyze the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\):**
   We know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are fixed points, so they must satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). We need to check if there are other solutions in the interval \([0, 1]\).

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the terms. However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the expression can be rewritten using angle addition formulas. Notice that:

 \[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ

So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin  50^\circ
\]

Again, we can use angle addition formulas. Notice that:

\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ

So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) given the conditions \(-1 \le x\) and \(y \le 1\), we will analyze the function step by step.

First, let's consider the domain of the function. The expressions \(\sqrt{1 - y^2}\) and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) are defined when \(|x| \le 1\) and \(|y| \le 1\). Therefore, the domain of \(f(x, y)\) is \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\).

Next, we will check the function at some specific points to get an idea of its behavior.

1. **Evaluate \(f(x, y)\) at \((0, 0)\):**
   \[
   f(0, 0) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0.
   \]
   So, \(f(0, 0) = 0\).

2.  **Evaluate \(f(x, y)\) at \((1, 1)\):**
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]
   So, \(f(1, 1) = 0\).

3. **Evaluate \(f(x, y)\) at \((1, -1)\):**
   \[
   f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]
   So, \(f(1, -1) = 0\).

4. **Evaluate \(f(x, y)\) at \((-1, 1)\):**
   \[
   f(-1, 1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 0 +  1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]
   So, \(f(-1, 1) = 0\).

From these evaluations, we see that the function \(f(x, y)\) takes the value 0 at several points in the domain. Now, we need to determine if this is the minimum value of the function.

To do this, we will consider the general form of the function and its properties. Notice that \(f(x, y)\) is symmetric with respect to the variables \(x\) and \(y\). Also, the function is continuous on the closed and bounded domain \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\), so it must attain its minimum value at some point in this domain. We have already found that \(f(x, y) = 0\) at several points, so the minimum value of the function is at least 0.

To confirm that 0 is indeed the minimum value, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Consider the vectors \(\mathbf{u} = (x, y)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (\sqrt{1 - y^2}, \sqrt{1 - x^2})\ The final answer is  \boxed{0} \).","[0, '0']",1,"[1, '1']",False
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the fact that the area of a triangle formed by vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is half the magnitude of their cross product. The vectors are given by \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k}  \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt {5}

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).\\

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We recognize that \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

The golden ratio \(\phi\) satisfies the quadratic equation:

\[ \phi^2 = \phi + 1. \]

We can use this property to find higher powers of \(z\). First, we square both sides of the equation \(z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi\):

\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = \phi^2. \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi^2. \]

Substituting \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\) into the equation, we have:

\[ z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2}  = \phi + 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi - 1. \]

Next, we find \(z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}\). We multiply \(z + \frac{1}{z}\) by \(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\):

\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = z^3 + z + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^3}. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \phi \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} + \phi. \]

Substituting \(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi - 1\) into the equation, we get:

\[ \phi (\phi - 1) = z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} + \phi. \ ]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[ \phi^2 - \phi = z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} + \phi. \]

Substituting \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\) into the equation, we get:

\[ \phi + 1 - \phi = z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} + \phi. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 1 = z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} + \phi. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = 1 - \phi. \]

We can see a pattern forming. Let's denote \(a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}\). We have the following recurrence relation:

\[ a_{n+1} = \phi a_n - a_{n-1}. \]

We already know:

"To find the area of triangle \( fle \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). This means that \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being towards the vertex. The centroid also divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area.

Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of each of the smaller triangles \( AGB \), \( BGC \), and \( CGA \) is:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AGB = \text{Area of } \triangle BGC = \text{Area of } \triangle CGA = \frac{144}{3} = 48
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \( W� \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it lies on the medians of the triangle, and the medians intersect at \( G \). When we draw a line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \), it will create a smaller triangle \( WL \) that is similar to triangle \( ABC \) with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{3}  \) (since \( G \) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths. Therefore, the area of triangle \( W G L \) is:

2. Identify the total number of books on the third stand.
3. Identify the total number of books on the fourth stand.
4. Calculate the number of books left for the second stand by subtracting the books on the first, third, and fourth stands from the total number of books.

Let's start with the given information:
- The total number of books on the first stand is 3.
- The total number of books on the third stand is 8.
- The total number of books on the fourth stand is 10.
- The total number of books on all stands combined is 24.

Now, let's calculate the number of books on the second stand:
\[

\]
\[
\text{Number of books on the second stand} = 24 - 21

\[
\text{Number of books on the second stand} = 3

"To determine the fifth term of the sequence, we first need to identify the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The fourth term is 200.
2. The eighth term is 500.

Using the general formula, we can write the equations for the fourth and eighth terms:
\[a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}\]
\[a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}\]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d = 75\) back into equation (1) to find the first term  \(a\):
\[a + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = 200 - 225\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have the first term \(a = -25\) and the common difference \(d = 75\), we can find the fifth term of the sequence using the general formula:
\[a_5 = a + 4d\]
\[a_5 = -25 + 4(75)\]

2. Identify the largest even number in the range.
3. Determine the total number of even numbers between these two numbers, inclusive.

The smallest even number in the range is 100, and the largest even number in the range is 150.

Even numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 2. The general form of an even number is \(2n\), where \(n\) is an integer. To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

Here, \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term (which is 150), \(a_1\) is the first term (which is 100), and \(d\) is the common difference (which is 2). We need to find \(n\).

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[150 = 100 + (n-1) \cdot  2\]

Simplify the equation:

\[150 = 100 + 2(n-1)\]
\[150 = 100 + 2n - 2\]
\[150 = 98 + 2n\]
\[150 - 98 = 2n\]

First, we find the prime factorization of 24:
\[ 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \]

The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying the results. For 24, this is:

So, the divisors of 24 are:

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen numbers from the set of prime numbers is even, we need to analyze the properties of prime numbers and their sums.

First, recall that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The only even prime number is 2, and all other prime numbers are odd.

The sum of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2), the only way for the sum of two prime numbers to be even is if both numbers are odd.

Now, let's consider the set of prime numbers. The set of prime numbers includes 2 and all other odd numbers. If we exclude 2, we are left with an infinite set of odd prime numbers.

When we select two numbers from the set of prime numbers, there are three possible scenarios:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.
3. One number is even and the other is odd.

Since there is only one even prime number (2), the probability of selecting two even prime numbers is zero (we can only select one even number, and we need two numbers).

The probability  of selecting two odd prime numbers is the product of the probabilities of selecting an odd prime number each time. Since there are infinitely many odd prime numbers and infinitely many prime numbers in total, the probability of selecting an odd prime number on each draw is \(\frac{\text{number of odd primes}}{\text{total number of primes}} = \frac{\infty}{\infty}\), which simplifies to 1 when considering the relative frequency of odd primes compared to all primes.

However, to be more precise, we can use the concept of limits or combinatorial arguments to show that the probability of selecting two odd prime numbers is \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since the probability of selecting an odd prime on each draw is \(\frac{\text{number of odd primes} - 1}{\text{total number of primes} - 1}\), which approaches \(\frac{1}{2}\) as the number of primes approaches infinity).

Therefore, the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers is even is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

   - The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.
   - The even numbers in the first set are {2}.
   - The odd numbers in the first set are {1, 3}.
   - The even numbers in the second set are {2, 4}.
   - The odd numbers in the second set are {1, 3}.

3. **Count the favorable outcomes:**
   - Both numbers are even: The possible pairs are (2, 2) and (2, 4). This gives us  2 outcomes.
   - Both numbers are odd: The possible pairs are (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). This gives us 4 outcomes.
   - Therefore, there are \(2 + 4 = 6\) favorable outcomes.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the two numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```

"To find the sum of the digits of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) after it has been expressed in decimal form, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}
   \]
   First, express \(5^7\) and \(2^8\) in terms of their decimal values:
   \[
   5^7 = 78125 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^8 = 256
   \]
   So the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
   \]

2. **Calculate the denominator:**
   \[
   78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
   \]
   Therefore, the fraction is:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{20000000}

3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**
   To convert \ (\frac{4321}{20000000}\) to a decimal, perform the division:
   \[
   4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605

4. **Sum the digits of the decimal:**
   The decimal form is \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\).
   Sum these digits:
   \[
   0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Let's start by noting that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\), so \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\).

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"To determine the geometric shape defined by the equation \( z = c \) in the cylindrical coordinate system, we need to understand the meaning of the coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis.
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the xy-plane, measured from the positive x-axis.
- \( z \) is the height above or below the xy-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) specifies that the height \( z \) is fixed at a constant value \( c \). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the z-coordinate does not change; it is always \( c \).

To visualize this, consider the following:
- If \( z = c \), then every point on the surface lies on a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \).
- The radial distance \( r \) and the angular coordinate \( \theta \) can vary, meaning that the points can be at different distances from the z-axis and at different angles in the xy-plane, but they will all lie on the same horizontal plane.

This description matches the definition of a horizontal plane or a plane  parallel to the xy-plane, which is a type of flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions within that plane. In cylindrical coordinates, a plane parallel to the xy-plane is often referred to as a ""do(secur"".

"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors:
\[

\]
We know that \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7\). Also, \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[

\]
Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
 \]
The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) or \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\). The smallest angle between two vectors is the one that is less than or equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), so \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) is the smallest angle.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. This means that if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x ) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This means \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to see that \(\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\). However, we need to express everything in terms of \(\ cos\), so we will use another identity involving \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Specifically, we use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\), which can be rewritten as:
\[
\sec^2 x = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x}.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \sec^2 70^\circ + \sec^2 50^\circ.
\]

Now, we use the fact that \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\sec^2 70^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\sec^2 50^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2  70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\). Using the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\), we have \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\).

"To determine the number of pieces in a balance scale, we need to consider the information given: the sum of the angles in the pieces is \(1070^\circ\).

First, let's clarify what we're dealing with. A balance scale typically has two sides, and each side is balanced by the other. This means the sum of the angles on one side must equal the sum of the angles on the other side.

Given that the total sum of the angles in all the pieces is \(1070^\circ\), we can set up the following equation where \(x\) is the number of pieces:

\[
2 \times \text{(sum of angles on one side)} = 1070^\circ
\]

Since the sum of angles on one side must equal the sum of angles on the other side, we can divide the total sum by 2:

\[
\text{Sum of angles on one side} = \frac{1070^\circ}{2} = 535^\circ
\]

This tells us that each side of the balance scale has a sum of \(535^\circ\). However, we need to determine the number of pieces, not the sum of angles per side . Since each piece has the same angle measure, we can denote the angle measure of each piece as \( \theta \).

Given that the total sum of the angles in all the pieces is \(1070^\circ\), we can write:

\[
n \times \theta = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we need to know the angle measure of each piece, \(\theta\). Since the problem does not specify the angle measure of each piece, we can assume that each piece has an equal angle measure. Let’s assume each piece has an angle measure of \( \theta = 107^\circ \) (a common angle measure in geometric problems).

Then we have:

\[
n \times 107^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[
n = \frac{1070^\circ}{107^\circ} = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces in the balance scale is:

The direction vector of this line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

To check if these direction vectors are parallel, we need to see if one is a scalar multiple of the other. We can check this by comparing the ratios of the corresponding components:
\ [

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, we will expand the expression as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\ ]

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), so \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these values into our expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3  \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 The final answer is  \boxed{ \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.}

"To determine the average number of stamps pulled by Juan per decade, we need to calculate the total number of stamps pulled each decade and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of stamps pulled each decade:

- **50s**: \(4 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 21\) stamps
- **60s**: \(7 + 4 + 4 + 9 = 24\) stamps
- **70s**: \(12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43\) stamps
- **80s**: \(8 + 15 + 10 + 9 = 42\) stamps

Next, we sum the total number of stamps pulled over all the decades:
\[21 + 24 + 43 + 42 = 130\]

Now, we calculate the average number of stamps pulled per decade by dividing the total number of stamps by the number of decades (which is 4):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{130}{4} = 32.5

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the average number of stamps pulled  per decade is:

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, and the conditions \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \) and \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the shape and given conditions:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \).
   - \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), meaning \( \triangle ACD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).

2. **Express the area of the trapezoid:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
   \]
   where \(h\) is the height from \(A\) to \(BC\).

3. **Express the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \):**
    The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \(CD\) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and \(AC\) is the base.

4. **Relate the areas:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ACB \):
   \[
   [ABCD] = [ACD] + [ACB]
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ACB \) share the same height from \(A\) and \(C\) to \(BC\), respectively, and their bases are \(CD\) and \(AB\) respectively. The area of \( \triangle ACB \) can be written as:
   \[
   [ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h
   \]
    Therefore, the total area of the trapezoid is:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = [ACD] + [ACB]
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \) and the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles, we can substitute the area of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ACB \) in terms of the given total area:
   \[
   42 = [ACD] + [ACB]
   \]
   But we know that \( [ACB] = [ACD] \) because the height is the same and the bases are parts of the same parallel line, thus:
   \[
   42 = 2 \times [ACD]
   \]
   Solving for \( [ACD] \):
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Eliminate the denominator by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\) by moving all \(x\)-terms to one side:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
    \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Let's identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the fractions:
- For \(\frac{7}{30}\), \(m = 7\) and \(n = 30\).
- For \(\frac{10}{21}\), \(p = 10\) and \(q = 21\).

Now, substitute these values into the operation formula:

First, calculate the product of \(m\) and \(p\):
\[

Next, calculate the fraction \(\frac{q}{n}\):
\[

Now, multiply the result of the product of \(m\) and \(p\) by \(\frac{q}{n}\):

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties and the possible positions of the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\).

1. **Define the Points and Segments:**
   - Points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are chosen randomly from a plane.
   - We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - For two line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses over the other. This can be visualized by considering the order of the points on the plane.

3. **Counting the Arrangements:**
   - There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a plane, which is \(4! = 24\).
   - We need to count the number of these arrangements where the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

4. **Intersecting Arrangements:**
   - For \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following forms  (considering the cyclic order of the points):
     - \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\)
     - \(A, D, C, B\) or \(A, B, C, D\) (but these do not form an intersection)
   - There are exactly 2 out of the 24 arrangements where the line segments intersect.

5. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability that \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\frac{2}{24} = \frac{1}{12}\).

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\). However, upon re-evaluation, the correct probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\), as the correct number of intersecting arrangements is actually 8 out of 24, leading to \(\frac{8}{24} = \frac{1}{3}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the radii of the cylinders:**
   - The radius of the smaller cylinder is \(r_1 = 1\).
   - The radius of the larger cylinder is \(r_2 = 2\).

2. **Determine the volumes of the cylinders:**
   - The volume \(V_1\) of the smaller cylinder is given by:
     \[
     V_1 = \pi r_1^2 h = \pi (1)^2 h = \pi h

5. **Determine the dimensions of the rolling cone:**
   - The rolling cone is formed by unrolling a sector of a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone.
   - The slant height \(l\) of the cone is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the height \(h\) and the radius of the base \(r\).
   - Since the rolling cone is formed by unrolling a sector of a circle with radius \(l\), the circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the arc length of the sector:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

Let \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \), we have:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = 0.9165

Now, we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot 0.8660 + 0.9165 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3464 + 0.45825 = 0.80465

Finally, we multiply these two results together:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.80465 \cdot 0.11185 = 0.08999999999999999 \approx 0.09

"To determine the number of different ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 cumulative and 6 demokated individuals, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, we have a total of 14 individuals (8 cumulative + 6 demokated), and we need to choose 5 of them to form a committee. So, we need to calculate \( \binom{14}{5} \).

The calculation is as follows:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}
\]

We can simplify this by canceling out the common factorial terms in the numerator and the denominator:
 \[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5!}
\]

Next, we calculate \( 5! \):
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into our combination formula:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{120}
\]

We can simplify the numerator step by step:
\[
14 \times 13 = 182
\]
\[
182 \times 12 = 2184
\]
\[
2184 \times 11 = 24024

\[
24024 \times  10 = 240240

Now, we divide by 120:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three numbers as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). We are given two pieces of information:

1. The product of the three numbers is 120:
   \[
   a \times b \times c = 120
   \]

2. The product of the numbers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three numbers is \(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\), so the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{a \times b \times c}{\frac{a + b + c}{3}} = 24
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{120 \times 3}{a + b + c} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \frac{360}{a + b + c} = 24
   \]
   Solving for \(a + b + c\), we multiply both sides by \(a + b + c\) and then divide by 24:
   \[
   360 = 24(a + b + c)
    \]
   \[
   a + b + c = \frac{360}{24} = 15
   \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(a \times b \times c = 120\)
2. \(a + b + c = 15\)

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. One possible solution is to check if there are integers that fit both conditions. Let's try \(a = 5\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 4\):

1. Check the product:
   \[
   5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120
   \]
   This is correct.

2. Check the sum:
   \[
   5 + 6 + 4 = 15

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   (\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
   \]

3. **Simplify both sides:**
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

4. **Rewrite the left-hand side as a perfect square:**
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

5. **Take the square root of both sides:**
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4096}

6. **Simplify the square root:**
   \[

7. **Solve the absolute value equation:**
   \[
   x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64

8. **Find the two possible solutions for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

9. **Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation:**

   For \(x = 66\):
   \[

   This is correct.

   For \(x = -62\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{38 44 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 252} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 252} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 252} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 252} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). We also know that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). We need to find the circumradius of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( AM \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \), and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Let's place \( B \) and \( C \) on the x-axis such that \( B = (-x, 0) \) and \( C = (x, 0) \). Then \( M = (0, 0) \) and \( A = (0, 11) \). The length of \( AM \) is 11, and the length of \( AD \) is 10. Since \( D \)  lies on \( AM \), let \( D = (0, y) \). Therefore, \( AD = 11 - y = 10 \), so \( y = 1 \). Thus, \( D = (0, 1) \).

Now, we need to find the coordinates of \( B \) and \( C \). Since \( B \) and \( C \) are symmetric about the y-axis, we can use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). The coordinates of \( B \) and \( C \) are \( (-x, 0) \) and \( (x, 0) \), respectively. The distance \( BD \) is \( \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \) and the distance \( CD \) is also \( \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \).

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the range of \(x\) that satisfies the inequality.

First, let's consider the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\). Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all \(x\).

Now, let's find the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\). We can rewrite the expression as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4.\]
The minimum value of \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is 4 (when \(x = 0\)), so the minimum value of \((x^2 + 2)^2 - 4\) is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^ 2\) is 0.

Next, we need to find the maximum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) such that it is less than 21. We need to solve the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We can factorize the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the interval where \(y\) is between 0 and 3. Therefore, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
 Taking the square root of all parts, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) are:

xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We aim to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or 
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p,
\]
and the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
We substitute \(x+y+z = s\) and rewrite it as:
 \[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
or
\[
sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
so
\[
s^3 = 64,

\[
s = 4.

"To determine the number of students who purchased tickets for the youts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students.
2. Determine the number of students who purchased youtubes in each grade.
3. Calculate the number of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined.
4. Determine the percentage of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined compared to the total number of students.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
\[ 300 \text{ boys} + 300 \text{ girls} = 600 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of students who purchased youtubes in each grade.**

For the 11th grade:
\[ \text{Number of students who purchased youtubes} = 20.6\% \text{ of } 300 = \frac{20.6}{100} \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62 \text { students} \]

For the 12th grade:
\[ \text{Number of students who purchased youtubes} = 8.6\% \text{ of } 300 = \frac{8.6}{100} \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26 \text{ students} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined.**

\[ 62 \text{ (11th grade)} + 26 \text{ (12th grade)} = 88 \text{ students} \]

**Step 4: Determine the percentage of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined compared to the total number of students.**

The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{88}{600} \right) \times 100 = \frac{8800}{600} = \frac{880}{60} = \frac{440}{30} = \frac {44}{3} \approx 14.67\% \]

However, we need to find the percentage that the number of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined represents compared to the number of students in the 11th and 12th grades combined. So, we need to calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{88}{300 + 300} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{88}{600} \right) \times 100 = \frac{8800}{600} = \frac{880}{60} = \frac{440}{30} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67\% \]

Therefore, the number of students who purchased youtubes in the 11th and 12th grades combined is \(\boxed{88}\). The percentage of students in the 11th and 12th grades combined who purchased youtubes is approximately \(14.67\%\).","[88, '88']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The denominator can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to consider the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).
\]
Therefore, the numerator is:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.
\]
This expression is always non-negative, and it equals zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).  It is positive for all other values of \(x\).

Now, let's analyze the inequality \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0\). The entire fraction will be negative if the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Since the numerator is always non-negative, the denominator must be negative for the fraction to be negative. The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

We need to exclude the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the track, we need to consider the shape of the track and the given constraints. The track is a rectangle with two semi-circles at the ends, and the total perimeter is 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semi-circles, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle plus the circumference of one full circle. The circumference of one full circle is \( \pi W \), so the total perimeter is given by:

\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to express the area \( A \) of the track in terms of \( L \) and \( W \). The area \( A \) is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semi-circles, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle plus the area of one full circle. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \) and the area of one full circle is \( \pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right)^2 = \frac {\pi W^2}{4} \), so the total area is:

\[ A = LW + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

From the perimeter equation, we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right)W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W}{2} - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:

\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0  \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ 200 = \frac{\pi W}{2} \]
\[ W = \frac{400}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{400}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 400}{2} = 0 \]

This result indicates that the maximum area is achieved when the length of the rectangle approaches zero, which is not practically feasible. However, the maximum area is achieved when the width \( W \) is \( \frac{400}{\pi} \) meters, and the length \( L \) is determined by the perimeter constraint. The maximum area is then:

\[ A = 200 \left(\frac{400}{\pi}\right) - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{400}{\pi}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{80000}{\pi} - \frac{40000 The final answer is  \boxed{40000} \]","[40000, '40000']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],False

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This implies that the length of \(ST\) is 2 units and the length of \(RT\) is 5 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2 \implies 5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2 \implies 25 = RS^2 + 4 \implies RS^2 = 21 \implies RS = \sqrt{21}
\ ]
Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In \(\triangle RST\), \(\angle T\) is opposite to \(RS\) and adjacent to \(ST\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
So, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the smallest distance from the point \((0, 0)\) to the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( d \) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
 d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2} x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root. Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We take the derivative \( f'(x) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\ ]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2} (0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2} (4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2} (-\sqrt{2})^4 - The final answer is  \boxed{5}\) is the smallest value. Therefore, the smallest distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), and the sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve for \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. If \( x \leq 3 \), then \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. If \( x > 3 \), then \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
    \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions are valid in this case.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x ) = 6 \).

1. If \( x \leq 3 \), then \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), this is a valid solution, so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. If \( x > 3 \), then \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it directly can be complex. However, we can check if there are any simple integer solutions. Testing \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of the weight of the ivy on Jack's top to the weight of the ivy on Jen's top. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the weight of the ivy on Jack's top:
   - The weight of the ivy on Jack's top is 150 grams.

2. Identify the weight of the ivy on Jen's top:
   - The weight of the ivy on Jen's top is 200 grams.

3. Determine the ratio of the weight of the ivy on Jack's top to the weight of the ivy on Jen's top:

4. Simplify the fraction:
   - The greatest common divisor of 150 and 200 is 50. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 50:

"To determine how many times the same digit appears in the number \(629_{10}\) when converted to base 7 and base 8, we need to first convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the digits.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and record the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10 }\) to base 8
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in base 7 and base 8
The number \(629_{10} = 1556_7\) has digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
The number \(629_{10} = 1165_8\) has digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits between the two representations  are 1, 5, and 6. Each common digit appears exactly once in both base 7 and base 8 representations.

"To determine the number of leap years in a 400-year period, we need to consider the rules for identifying leap years. A year is a leap year if it meets the following criteria:

1. It is divisible by 4.
2. If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of years in the period:**
   We are considering a 400-year period.

2. **Count the number of years divisible by 4:**
   To find the number of years divisible by 4, we divide 400 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   So, there are 100 years divisible by 4.

3. **Count the number of years divisible by 100:**
   To find the number of years divisible by 100, we divide 400 by 100:
   \[
   \frac{400}{100} = 4
   \]
   So, there are  4 years divisible by 100.

4. **Count the number of years divisible by 400:**
   To find the number of years divisible by 400, we divide 400 by 400:
   \[
   \frac{400}{400} = 1
   \]
   So, there is 1 year divisible by 400.

5. **Apply the leap year rule:**
   According to the leap year rule, we need to subtract the number of years divisible by 100 from the number of years divisible by 4, and then add back the number of years divisible by 400 (since they were subtracted twice).

   First, subtract the number of years divisible by 100 from the number of years divisible by 4:
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96
   \]

   Then, add back the number of years divisible by 400:

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is obtained by evaluating \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to find \( g(1) \):

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the point on the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) that is closest to the point \( (6, 0) \), we need to find the point on the line where the perpendicular from \( (6, 0) \) intersects the line. The slope of the given line is 2, so the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal, which is \(-\frac{1}{2}\). The equation of the perpendicular line passing through \( (6, 0) \) is:

\[ y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6) \]
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \]

Now, we need to find the intersection of this perpendicular line with the original line \( y = 2x - 2 \). We set the equations equal to each other:

\[ -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 2x - 2 \]
\[ 3 + 2 = 2x + \frac{1}{2}x \]
\[ 5 = \frac{5}{2}x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Substitute \( x =  2 \) back into the equation \( y = 2x - 2 \):

\[ y = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \]

So, the point on the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) that is closest to \( (6, 0) \) is \( (2, 2) \).

To express this in the form of a functional equation, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The distance \( d \) from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( Ax + By + C = 0 \) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]

For the line \( y = 2x - 2 \), we can rewrite it as \( 2x - y - 2 = 0 \). Here, \( A = 2 \), \( B = -1 \), and \( C = -2 \). The point is \( (6, 0) \), so \( x_1 = 6 \) and  \( y_1 = 0 \). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[ d = \frac{|2(6) - 1(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

So, the distance from the point \( (6, 0) \) to the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) is \( 2\sqrt{5} \).

\[ S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 . \]

We know that the sum of all possible products of the roots taken two at a time is zero. Therefore, we can write:

Let's denote the cost of one kilogram of oranges by \( O \) and the cost of one kilogram of apples by \( A \).

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. \( 2O + A = 1.24 \)
2. \( 3O + A = 1.82 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( A \):
\[ (3O + A) - (2O + A) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 3O + A - 2O - A = 0.58 \]
\[ O = 0.58 \]

Now that we have the value of \( O \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( A \):
\[ 2(0.58) + A = 1.24 \]
\[ 1.16 + A = 1.24 \]
\[ A = 1. 24 - 1.16 \]
\[ A = 0.08 \]

So, the cost of one kilogram of apples is \( 0.08 \) dollars, which is equivalent to 8 cents.

1. **Set up the division**: The fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) means 137 divided by 500.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - Since 137 is less than 500, we know the result will be less than 1. We can write 137 as 137.000 to make the division easier.

   - Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
   - Bring down the next 0 to make it 3700.
   - Divide 3700 by 500. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \( 500 \times 7 = 3500\)). Write 7 in the hundredths place of the quotient.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine which point among \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) is closest to the circumcenter \(O\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\). Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the circumcenter \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals, and it is equidistant from all four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Therefore, the distance from \(O\) to each of these points is the same, which is the radius of the circumcircle of the rectangle.

Given that the distance from \(O\) to each of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) is the same, the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of the rectangle is closest to \(O\) is the same for each vertex. Since there are four vertices, the probability is:

\[
\frac{1}{4}

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point in the interior of the rectangle is closest to \(O\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).```

"To determine the value of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Let's go through the steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6:
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   This means that 54 can be expressed as:
   \[
   54 = 6 \times 9 + 0
   \]
   Here, 9 is the quotient and 0 is the remainder.

2. The remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. Therefore, we can write:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at different values of \( n \) and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given values:

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left\lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \right\rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than 4, we use the floor function:  \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \left\lfloor \sqrt{45} \right\rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \). Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \left\lfloor 4 \right\rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total, we need to sum their individual amounts:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

First, let's add the amounts step by step:

1. Add Linda's and Sherry's amounts:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

2. Add June's amount to the result:
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

3. Add Connie's amount to the result:
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59.

Next, we need to find out how much money they have left after returning the money to their banknotes. Since they are returning banknotes, they will be giving the exact amount of money in banknotes. The smallest unit of money they can return is a banknote, which is \$1. Therefore, they will  return 126 banknotes of \$1 each, and the remaining amount will be in banknotes of \$0.59.

The remaining amount in dollars and cents is \$0.59. To convert this into cents, we note that \$0.59 is equal to 59 cents.

Thus, the amount of money they have left in banknotes, except for the \$1 banknotes, is \(\boxed{59}\) sent piece.```

"To determine the average (arithmetic mean) of the scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of all the scores. We have:
- 20 students with a score of 80
- 8 students with a score of 90
- 2 students with a score of 100

The total sum of the scores is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Let's perform the multiplications first:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, add these products together:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we need to divide the total sum by the number of students. The total number of students is:
\[ 20 + 8 + 2 = 30  \]

So, the average score is:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

"Given that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and the two diagonals of a 3x3 magic square is the same, we need to determine the value of \( n \).

A 3x3 magic square has the property that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. This sum is called the magic constant, and for a 3x3 magic square filled with the numbers 1 through 9, the magic constant is 15.

Let's denote the numbers in the 3x3 magic square as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i \\
\end{array}
\]
The magic constant condition gives us the following equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 15 \)
2. \( d + e + f = 15 \)
3. \( g + h + i = 15 \)
4. \( a + d + g = 15 \)
5. \( b + e + h = 15 \)
6. \( c + f + i = 15 \)
7.  \( a + e + i = 15 \)
8. \( c + e + g = 15 \)

We can use the fact that the sum of all the numbers in the square is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 \). Since the sum of each row is 15, the sum of all three rows is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \), which is consistent with the sum of all the numbers in the square.

To find the value of \( n \), we need to determine the value of the center number \( e \). In a 3x3 magic square, the center number is always the average of the first and last numbers in the sequence, which is \( \frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5 \).

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{5} \).```

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity satisfying \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\) and \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). We can use the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) to express \(\omega^2\) as \(-1 - \omega\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity  for the sum of fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) or \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{2 - 1}{1 - 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1

"To determine the shortest distance from point \( D \) to the triangle formed by points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), we need to find the perpendicular distance from point \( D \) to each of the sides of the triangle and identify the shortest one.

First, let's establish the coordinates of the points:
- \( D = (0, 0) \)
- \( A = (-3, 3) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)

We will use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The distance \( d \) from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( ax + by + c = 0 \) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Find the equation of line \( AB \)
The line passing through points \( A(-3, 3) \) and \( B(3, 0) \) can be found using the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b  \).

First, calculate the slope \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{0 - 3}{3 - (-3)} = \frac{-3}{6} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Using point \( B(3, 0) \) to find \( b \):
\[
0 = -\frac{1}{2}(3) + b \implies b = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, the equation of line \( AB \) is:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}
\]

Rewrite in standard form:
\[
x + 2y - 3 = 0
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance from \( D(0, 0) \) to line \( AB \)
Using the distance formula:
\[
d_{AB} = \frac{|1(0) + 2(0) - 3|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = \frac{|-3|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}
 \]

### Step 3: Find the equation of line \( BC \)
The line passing through points \( B(3, 0) \) and \( C(0, -4) \) can be found using the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b  \).

First, calculate the slope \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{-4 - 0}{0 - 3} = \frac{-4}{-3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Using point \( B(3, 0) \) to find \( b \):
\[
0 = \frac{4}{3}(3) + b \implies b = -4
\]

Thus, the equation of line \( BC \) is:
\[
y = \frac{4}{3}x - 4
\]

Rewrite in standard form:
\[
4x - 3y - 12 = 0
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the distance from \( D(0, 0) \) to line \( BC \)
