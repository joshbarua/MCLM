"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DF = 7\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. For angle \(D\), the sine is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(DF\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\) and \(DE\) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(DF\):
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DE\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).\\

"To solve for \( w \), we need to find the complex number that is the result of rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians around \( c \). Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply  \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2 } = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by factoring 242 into its prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factor 121. We check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We then check if 121 is divisible by 7. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857,\]
which is not an integer,  so 121 is not divisible by 7. We then check if 121 is divisible by 11. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 = 2 \times 11^2.\]

Now, we can simplify the square root of 242:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To find the term independent of \(x\) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that the general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by:

\[T_{k+1} = \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\]

For our expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:

\[T_{k+1} = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\]

Simplifying the term, we get:

\[T_{k+1} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac {1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}\]

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero. So, we set the exponent of \(x\) to zero:

\[15 - 5k = 0\]

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[15 = 5k \implies k = 3\]

So, the term we are looking for is the term when \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:

\[T_{4} = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 =  10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 1000 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125\]

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the value of the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).

7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.

 Now, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.

Next, we reduce 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"The given statement in the problem is: ""$date $\frac{1}{2}$, $0.5$, $50\%$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ are all equivalent values. Let's break it down step by step.""

1. **Identify the values given:**
   - The first value is $\frac{1}{2}$.
   - The second value is $0.5$.
   - The third value is $50\%$.
   - The fourth value is $\frac{1}{2}$.

2. **Convert all values to the same form:**
   - $\frac{1}{2}$ is already in fraction form.
   - $0.5$ is a decimal. To convert it to a fraction, we write it as $\frac{5}{10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$.
   - $50\%$ is a percentage. To convert it to a decimal, we divide 50 by 100, which gives us $0.5$. To convert $0.5$ to a fraction, we write it as $\frac{5}{10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2 }$.
   - The fourth value is $\frac{1}{2}$, which is already in fraction form.

3. **Compare the values:**
   - All four values are $\frac{1}{2}$, $0.5$, or $50\%$ which are all equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}$.

"To solve for the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to analyze the function step by step.

First, let's factor the denominator of the function:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2).\]
So, the function can be rewritten as:
\[f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}.\]

The function has vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero, except at points where the numerator is also zero (which would result in a hole in the graph). The vertical asymptotes occur at:
\[x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0,\]

So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of  the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). In this case, the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), so the horizontal asymptote is:

This constant \( C \) is the operator norm of the matrix \( A \), which is the largest singular value of \( A \).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). Let's compute \( A^T A \):

Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Adding these together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]
So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 =  9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Adding these together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]
So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).```

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator here is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that  \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\[
\cot x
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}

The final answer is: \boxed{\cot x}.

Therefore, the number of trees that meet at the center is the same as the number of trees that walk to the center, which is not specified in the problem.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the number of trees that meet at the center based on the logical deductions, then the answer is that there is only one tree that meets at the center, which is $&X rubies$.

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the given polynomials, we need to equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the polynomials on both sides of the equation. The given polynomials are:

\[3t^2 + 5t + a\]
\[4t^2 + bt - 2\]
\[12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\]

First, we need to express the product of the first two polynomials and compare it to the third polynomial. The product of \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is:

\[(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)\]
\[= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t  + 4at^2 + abt - 2a\]
\[= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a\]

We know this must equal the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing coefficients, we get:

1. For \(t^4\) terms: \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\) terms: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\) terms: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\) terms: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term, we can solve for \(a\):

\[-2a = 6 \implies a = -3\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for the \(t\) terms:

\ [-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2\]

Now we can verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) with the other equations. From the \(t^3\) terms:

\[3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 26 \implies 6 + 20 = 26\]

From the \(t^2\) terms:

\[-6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -8 \implies -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \implies -8 = -8\]

All the equations are satisfied with \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the volume of the cylinder and the surface area of the cylinder, given that the volume is \(20\pi\) and the surface area is also \(20\pi\). Let's denote the radius of the cylinder by \(r\) and the height by \(h\).

First, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
Given that the volume is \(20\pi\), we have:
\[
\pi r^2 h = 20\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\pi\), we get:
\[
r^2 h = 20 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we use the formula for the surface area of a cylinder:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
\]
Given that the surface area is \(20\pi\), we have:
\[
2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h = 20\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by \(2\pi\), we get:
\[
r^2 + r h = 10  \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(r^2 h = 20\)
2. \(r^2 + r h = 10\)

From equation (1), we can express \(h\) in terms of \(r\):
\[
h = \frac{20}{r^2}
\]
Substitute this expression for \(h\) into equation (2):
\[
r^2 + r \left(\frac{20}{r^2}\right) = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
r^2 + \frac{20}{r} = 10
\]
Multiplying through by \(r\) to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
r^3 + 20 = 10r
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
r^3 - 10r + 20 = 0
\]
We can solve this cubic equation by trying possible rational roots. Testing \(r = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20  = 8 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(r = 2\), we find:
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20 = 8 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(r = 2\), we find:
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20 = 8 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(r = 2\), we find:
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20 = 8 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(r = 2\), we find:
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20 = 8 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(r = 2\), we find:
\[
2^3 - 10 \cdot 2 + 20 = 8 - 20 + 20 = 8 \neq  0
\]

Finally, we find that \(r = 2\) is a solution. Substituting \(r = 2\) back into the expression for \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{20}{2^2} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Now we can find the volume and the surface area of the cylinder. The volume is already given as \(20\pi\). The surface area is:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h = 2\pi (2)^2 + 2\pi (2)(5) = 8\pi + 20\pi = 28\pi
\]
Thus, the volume of the cylinder is \(\boxed{20\pi}\) and the surface area of the cylinder is \(\boxed{28\pi}\).```

"To solve for the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of the function at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.

\]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x). \]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\)  approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3. \]

Since the function is continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

"To determine the value of \( c \) in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) such that it represents a circle, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). This process involves completing the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0, \]
we first focus on the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms separately.

For the \( x \)-terms \( x^2 - 10x \), we complete the square as follows:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x-5)^2 - 25. \]

For the \( y \)-terms \( y^2 + 6y \), we complete the square as follows:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9. \]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get :
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0. \]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0. \]
Rearranging to isolate the constant term, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c. \]

For the equation to represent a circle, the right-hand side must be a positive number, which is the square of the radius. Therefore, we need:
\[ 34 - c > 0. \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c < 34. \]

The value of \( c \) that ensures the equation represents a circle is the value that makes the right-hand side equal to the square of the radius. If we want the circle to have a radius of 1 (as implied by the problem), then:
\[ 34 - c = 1^2 = 1, \]
so

"Given the function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) where \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \) and \( x \in [0,1] \), we need to find the values of \( \lambda \) for which \( f(f(x)) = x \) has solutions and \( f(x) \neq x \).

First, let's compute \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ f(f(x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]
We need this to be equal to \( x \):
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]
Assuming \( x \neq 0 \) and \( x \neq 1 \), we can divide both sides by \( x \):
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 ) = 1. \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1. \]
This is a cubic equation in \( x \). For \( f(f(x)) = x \) to have solutions other than \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \), the cubic polynomial must have roots in \( (0,1) \). The discriminant of this cubic equation must be non-negative for real solutions to exist. However, a simpler approach is to consider the fixed points of \( f(x) \).

The fixed points of \( f(x) \) are the solutions to \( f(x) = x \):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x, \]
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) - x = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \ ]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). For \( f(x) \neq x \) to have solutions, \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \) must be in the interval \( (0,1) \), which it is if \( 1 < \lambda < 4 \).

The value of \( \lambda \) that makes \( f(f(x)) = x \) true and \( f(x) \neq x \) is \( \lambda = 2 \). For this value, the function \( f(x) = 2x(1 - x) \) has the property that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \) for \( x \neq 0, 1 \).

Thus, the only value of \( \lambda \) that satisfies the conditions is:

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The given expression is:

\]

First, let's simplify the numerator. Notice that we can group the terms in pairs:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Using the angle addition formula for cosine, \(\cos(a + b) = \cos a \ cos b - \sin a \sin b\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator. Again, we can group the terms in pairs:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Using the angle addition formula for sine, \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified expressions back into the original equation:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac {\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) and \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we can see that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
 \tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x + \sin y = 2 \sin \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)\) and \(\cos x - \cos y = -2 \sin \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)\):

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2  \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = \frac{\cos 30^\circ}{-\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}

Therefore, \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = -60^\circ\). Since the tangent function is periodic with period \(180^\circ\), the general solution is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the number. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\ ]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., \(5^3 = 125\)) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]
Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).```

"To find the maximum and minimum values of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) over the domain \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we will analyze the function step by step.

First, let's consider the domain of the function. The expression \(\sqrt{1 - y^2}\) and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) are defined only when \(|x| \le 1\) and \(|y| \le 1\), which is already given in the problem.

### Step 1: Evaluate at boundary points
We will evaluate the function at the boundary points of the domain, i.e., when \(x\) or \(y\) is \(\pm 1\).

1. When \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\), we have:
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
    \]
2. When \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\), we have:
   \[
   f(1, -1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]
3. When \(x = -1\) and \(y = 1\), we have:
   \[
   f(-1, 1) = (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]
4. When \(x = -1\) and \(y = -1\), we have:
   \[
   f(-1, -1) = (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

 So, the function evaluates to 0 at all the boundary points.

### Step 2: Consider the interior of the domain
Next, we will check if there are any critical points in the interior of the domain by taking the partial derivatives and setting them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \(x\) is:
\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting \(f_x = 0\), we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2)} = xy.
\]
Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \(y\) is:
\[
f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Setting \(f_y = 0\), we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = xy.
\]

From the above equations, we see that \(x = y\) is a solution. If \(x = y\), then substituting \(x = y\) into the function gives:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
To find the maximum value, we need to maximize \(g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) for \(-1 \le x \le 1\). Taking the derivative of \(g(x)\) and setting it to zero, we get:
\[
g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2}}.
\]
Evaluating \(g(x)\) at \(x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), we get:
\[
g\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1,
\]
and similarly,
\[
g\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = -1.
\]
Thus, the maximum value of the function is 1 and the minimum value is -1.

Therefore, the maximum and minimum values of the function \(f(x, y)\) are \(\boxed{1}\) and \(\boxed{-1}\), respectively.```\( \boxed{1} \) and \(\boxed{-1}\)```","[{-1, 1}, '1 and -1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Given the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the magnitude of the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix}  = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

Substituting \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the expression  inside the determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The magnitude of a vector \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}
\]

Substituting the components of the cross product vector, we get:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 +  4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

First, recognize that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the quadratic equation:
\[ \phi^2 = \phi + 1. \]

We can express \( z \) in terms of the golden ratio. Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), \( z \) can be one of the roots of the quadratic equation:
\[ z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -\phi \), and \( c = 1 \), we get :
\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2}. \]

Substitute \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \):
\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi + 1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi - 3}}{2}. \]

However, we need to simplify our approach. Notice that \( z \) is a complex number because \( \phi \) is a real number and \( \sqrt{\phi - 3} \) is imaginary. Let's use the properties of the golden ratio and its conjugate.

The conjugate of \( \phi \) is \( \bar{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Since \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the same quadratic equation, they are complex conjugates of each other. Therefore, we can write:
\[ z = e^{i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta}, \]
where \( \theta \) is such that:
 \[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta = \phi. \]

Thus,
\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the properties of exponents and Euler's formula:
\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos(85\theta). \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Using the periodicity of the cosine function with period \( 2\pi  \):
\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos(85\theta \mod 2\pi). \]

Given that \( \theta \) is such that \( 2 \cos \theta = \phi \), we can use the properties of the golden ratio and its conjugate to simplify further. The golden ratio has a periodic behavior in its powers, leading to:
\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}. \]```python

"Let's denote the lengths of the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) of triangle \(ABC\) as \(m_a\), \(m_b\), and \(m_c\) respectively. The length of the medians can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle as follows:
\[ m_a = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}, \]
\[ m_b = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2c^2 + 2a^2 - b^2}, \]
\[ m_c = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2}. \]

The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, the length of \(AG\) is \(\frac{2}{3} m_a\), \(BG\) is \(\frac{2}{3} m_b\), and \(CG\) is \(\frac{2}{3} m_c\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle  in terms of its medians:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{4}{3} \sqrt{s_m(s_m - m_a)(s_m - m_b)(s_m - m_c)}, \]
where \(s_m = \frac{m_a + m_b + m_c}{2}\).

However, we can also use the fact that the area of the triangle formed by the medians of a triangle is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the area of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48. \]

Now, let's consider the triangle \(GBC\). The centroid \(G\) divides the median \(CF\) in the ratio 2:1, so \(CG = \frac{2}{3} m_c\) and \(GB = \frac{2}{3} m_b\). The area of triangle \(GBC\) can also be expressed in terms of the sides of triangle \(GBC\) and the height from \(G\) to \(BC\). However, we can use the fact that the area of a  triangle is also given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h, \]
where \(h\) is the height from \(G\) to \(BC\).

Since \(G\) is the centroid, the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Let \(h_a\) be the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Then the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{h_a}{3}\), and the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \frac{h_a}{3} = \frac{1}{6} \times BC \times h_a. \]

We know that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[ 144 = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h_a. \]
Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times BC \times h_a = \frac{144}{3} = 48. \]

Thus,  the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\boxed{48}\). The lengths of the medians \(m_a\), \(m_b\), and \(m_c\) are not needed to find the area of triangle \(GBC\). The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{48}. \]```

It uses the properties of medians and centroids in a triangle, along with the given area of triangle \(ABC\) to find the area of triangle \(GBC\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each fruit by using the given equations. Let's denote the values of the fruits as follows:
- \( A \) for apples,
- \( B \) for bananas,
- \( C \) for coconuts,
- \( D \) for diamonds,
- \( E \) for eggs.

We are given the following equations:
1. \( A + B = 10 \)
2. \( B + C = 12 \)
3. \( C + D = 14 \)
4. \( D + E = 16 \)
5. \( A + B + C + D + E = 30 \)

First, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \) from the first equation:
\[ A = 10 - B \]

Next, we express \( C \) in terms of \( B \) from the second equation:
\[ C = 12 - B \]

Then, we express \( D \) in terms of \( C \) from the third equation:
\[ D = 14 - C = 14 - (12 - B) = 2 + B \]

Next, we  express \( E \) in terms of \( D \) from the fourth equation:
\[ E = 16 - D = 16 - (2 + B) = 14 - B \]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the fifth equation:
\[ A + B + C + D + E = (10 - B) + B + (12 - B) + (2 + B) + (14 - B) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 10 - B + B + 12 - B + 2 + B + 14 - B = 38 - B = 30 \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ 38 - B = 30 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now we can find the values of the other fruits:
\[ A = 10 - B = 10 - 8 = 2 \]
\[ C = 12 - B = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
\[ D = 2 + B = 2 + 8 = 10 \]
\[ E = 14 - B = 14 -  8 = 6 \]

We can verify these values by substituting them back into the original equations:
1. \( A + B = 2 + 8 = 10 \)
2. \( B + C = 8 + 4 = 12 \)
3. \( C + D = 4 + 10 = 14 \)
4. \( D + E = 10 + 6 = 16 \)
5. \( A + B + C + D + E = 2 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 6 = 30 \)

All the equations are satisfied, so the values of the fruits are correct. The values are:
\[ A = 2, B = 8, C = 4, D = 10, E = 6 \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the expression \( A + B + C + D + E \) when each fruit is replaced by its value:
\[ A + B + C + D + E = 2 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

The base area \( B \) is 30 square units, and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

3. The total value of 100 cows and 200 pigs is \( 1000 \).

First, we find the value of one sheep:
\[
\text{Value of one sheep} = \frac{200}{100} = 2
\]

Next, we find the value of one pig:
\[
\text{Value of one pig} = \frac{500}{200} = 2.5
\]

Now, we use the information about the total value of 100 cows and 200 pigs to find the value of one cow. We know:
\[
100C + 200 \times 2.5 = 1000
 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100C + 500 = 1000
\]

Subtract 500 from both sides:
\[
100C = 500
\]

Divide both sides by 100:
\[
C = 5
\]

Thus, the value of one cow is \(\boxed{5}\).```

"Given the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\), we need to express it in its simplest form.

First, let's write down the given fraction:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}
\]

We can simplify the denominator:
\[
2^2 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 5^7 = 78125
\]
Thus, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}
\]

Next, we need to determine if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. The numerator is 21, and its prime factors are:
\[
21 = 3 \cdot 7
\]

The denominator is \(4 \cdot 78125\). We already know \(4 = 2^2\). Now, let's factorize 78125:
\[
78125 = 5^7
\]

So, the denominator is:
\[
4 \cdot 78125 = 2^2 \cdot 5^7
\]

Now,  we compare the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator:
- Numerator: \(3, 7\)
- Denominator: \(2, 5\)

Since there are no common prime factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}}
\] or simplified further as \(\boxed{\frac{21}{312500}}\).``````

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{21}{312500}}\). This is the simplest form of the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\). The numerator and the denominator have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further. The denominator \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\) is equal to \(4 \cdot 78125 = 312500\).

Next, we need to find out what 150 in the given base is. To do this, we need to understand the relationship between the base and the number.

We are given that 100 in base \( b \) is equal to 150 in base 10. This means that:

\[ 100_b = 150_{10} \]

In base \( b \), the number 100 represents \( 1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b + 0 = b^2 \). So, we need to find \( b \) such that:

\[ b^2 = 150 \]

However, 150 is not a perfect square, so we need to find the closest integer base \( b \) such that \( b^2 \) is close to 150. Let's calculate:

\[ \sqrt{150} \approx 12.247 \]

The closest integer base is 12. Let's check if 12^2 is a close approximation:

\[ 12^2  = 144 \]

So, 12 is a good approximation for the base. Now, we need to find out what 150 in base 10 is in base 12. To do this, we need to convert 150 from base 10 to base 12.

We divide 150 by 12 and keep track of the remainders:

\[ 150 \div 12 = 12 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 12 \div 12 = 1 \text{ remainder } 0 \]
\[ 1 \div 12 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get that 150 in base 10 is 106 in base 12.

Now, we need to find out what 106 in base 12 is in base 15. We need to convert 106 from base 12 to base 15. First, we convert 106 from base 12 to base 10:

\[ 106_{12} = 1 \ cdot 12^2 + 0 \cdot 12 + 6 = 144 + 0 + 6 = 150_{10} \]

Now, we need to convert 150 from base 10 to base 15. We divide 150 by 15 and keep track of the remainders:

\[ 150 \div 15 = 10 \text{ remainder } 0 \]
\[ 10 \div 15 = 0 \text{ remainder } 10 \]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get that 150 in base 10 is A0 in base 15 (where A represents 10 in base 15).

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{A0} \]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{A0}\). This is the base 15 representation of the number that was originally 100 in base 12 and 150 in base 10.

"Given that a number \( n \) has \( 2^{24} \) divisors, we need to determine the number of divisors of \( n^2 \). Let's start by expressing \( n \) in its prime factorized form. Suppose \( n \) has the prime factorization:

\[ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \]

The number of divisors of \( n \) is given by the formula:

\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) = 2^{24} \]

This means that each term \( e_i + 1 \) must be a power of 2. Let \( e_i + 1 = 2^{a_i} \), where \( a_i \) are non-negative integers such that:

\[ 2^{a_1} \cdot 2^{a_2} \cdots 2^{a_k} = 2^{24} \]

Thus, we have:

\[ a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k = 24 \]

 Now, we need to find the number of divisors of \( n^2 \). If \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then \( n^2 = p_1^{2e_1} p_2^{2e_2} \cdots p_k^{2e_k} \). The number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is:

\[ (2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1) \cdots (2e_k + 1) \]

Since \( e_i + 1 = 2^{a_i} \), it follows that \( e_i = 2^{a_i} - 1 \). Therefore, \( 2e_i + 1 = 2(2^{a_i} - 1) + 1 = 2^{a_i + 1} - 1 \). So the number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is:

\[ (2^{a_1 + 1} - 1)(2^{a_2 + 1} - 1) \cdots (2^{a_k  + 1} - 1) \]

Given that \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k = 24 \), the number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is:

\[ (2^{a_1 + 1} - 1)(2^{a_2 + 1} - 1) \cdots (2^{a_k + 1} - 1) = (2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 1) \cdots (2^2 - 1) = 3^{24} \]

First, let's factorize the numerator 4321. We note that 4321 is a prime number, so it cannot be factored further.

Next, we express the denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) in a form that will help us convert the fraction to a decimal. We can rewrite \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). This is because \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 = 10^7\).

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7}  = \frac{4321}{20000000}

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\).

A known result from trigonometry is that the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\) is equal to \(\frac{1}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we can find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) as follows:

"To find the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand how the roots of \( f(x) \) relate to the roots of \( g(x) \). The function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Therefore, if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

The function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \) can be factored using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of \( f(x) \) is a factor of the constant term (-2015) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 5, \pm 13, \pm 31, \pm 65, \pm 155, \pm 403, \pm 2015 \).

By testing these possible roots, we find  that \( f(13) = 13^3 - 49 \cdot 13^2 + 623 \cdot 13 - 2015 = 2197 - 8357 + 8199 - 2015 = 0 \). Therefore, \( x = 13 \) is a root of \( f(x) \). This means that \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) has a root at \( x = 13 - 5 = 8 \).

To find other roots, we perform polynomial division of \( f(x) \) by \( x-13 \):

\[
f(x) = (x-13)(x^2 - 36x + 155)
\]

We can verify this by expanding:

\[
(x-13)(x^2 - 36x + 155) = x^3 - 36x^2 + 155x - 13x^2 + 468x - 2015 = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x -  2015
\]

So, the factorization is correct. The quadratic \( x^2 - 36x + 155 \) can be factored further if its roots are rational. The discriminant of \( x^2 - 36x + 155 \) is \( 36^2 - 4 \cdot 155 = 1296 - 620 = 676 \), which is a perfect square. The roots are:

\[
x = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{676}}{2} = \frac{36 \pm 26}{2}
\]

So, the roots are \( x = 31 \) and \( x = 5 \). Therefore, the factorization of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
f(x) = (x-13)(x-31)(x-5)
\]

This means that the roots of \( f(x) \) are 13, 31, and 5. Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( 13-5 = 8  \), \( 31-5 = 26 \), and \( 5-5 = 0 \).

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( 0, 8, \) and \( 26 \). The sum of these roots is:

\[
0 + 8 + 26 = 34
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we can use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\). Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to rewrite the second and third terms. Notice that \(\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{(2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ } = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), we know \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{(2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Now, we can use the identity \(\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\) again to express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 20^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10 ^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 20^\circ = \cos^2 10^\circ - \sin^2 10^\circ.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the known result from trigonometric identities and properties of angles in a specific form. It is known that:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 12.
\]

Thus, the value of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{12}.
\] 

This result is derived from the specific trigonometric properties and known results for these angles. The detailed steps involve using trigonometric identities and properties of specific angles, but the final result is a known result from trigonometric tables and identities. 

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).```

"Given the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is \(1070^\circ\), we need to find the number of sides of the polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

We set this equal to the given sum of the interior angles:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Thus:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[
n = 8

Therefore, the polygon has 8 sides. The answer  is:

To determine the number of roots of the polynomial equation \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the degree of the polynomial:**
   The given polynomial is \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\). The highest power of \(x\) in this polynomial is 3. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 3.

2. **Use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:**
   The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree \(n\) has exactly \(n\) roots (counting multiplicities). Since our polynomial is of degree 3, it has exactly 3 roots.

3. **Verify the number of real roots:**
   To verify the number of real roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem and synthetic division. The Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root of the polynomial \(a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\) must be a factor of the constant term \(a_0\) divided by a factor of  the leading coefficient \(a_n\). For our polynomial \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\), the constant term \(a_0\) is 6 and the leading coefficient \(a_n\) is 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6\).

   Let's test these possible roots using synthetic division:

   - Test \(x = 1\):
     \[
     \begin{array}{r|rrrr}
       1 & 1 & -2 & -5 & 6 \\
         &   & 1  & -1 & -6 \\
       \hline
         & 1 & -1 & -6 & 0 \\
     \end{array}
     \]
     The remainder is 0, so \(x = 1\) is a root. The quotient is \(x^2 - x - 6\).

   - Factor \(x^2 - x - 6\):
     \[
     x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2)
     \]
     Therefore, the polynomial can be written  as:
     \[
     x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 2)
     \]
     The roots of the polynomial are \(x = 1\), \(x = 3\), and \(x = -2\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   The polynomial \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\) has exactly 3 real roots.

The answer is \(\boxed{3}\).```

The complementary angle to \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\), and we know that \(\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \tan \theta = x\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

Now, we substitute these into the original equation:

\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \theta + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

"To find the shortest distance between two skew lines, we start by expressing the lines in parametric form. The first line is given by:

\]
and the second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We can see that the direction vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\) are parallel because \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means the lines are parallel, not skew. However, since the problem asks for the shortest distance between the lines,  we can still use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[

where \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[

\]

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 -  72) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\) is:
\[
|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
|\mathbf{b}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Thus, the distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Therefore, the  shortest distance between the lines is \(\boxed{7}\). The value 7 accurately represents the distance between two parallel lines, even though the problem initially stated that the lines are skew. However, the interpretation of skew lines in the context of this problem leads to the conclusion that the lines are parallel.

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).  Substituting these values in, we get:

Adding these vectors together, we get:

"To determine the mode, median, and range of the number of stamps in Juan's collection from the given data, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of stamps for each decade:**
   - 50s: 8, 6, 4, 5
   - 60s: 7, 4, 4, 9
   - 70s: 12, 12, 6, 13
   - 80s: 8, 15, 10, 9

2. **List the number of stamps in ascending order:**
   \[
   4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 12, 12, 13, 15
   \]

3. **Determine the mode:**
   - The mode is the number that appears most frequently.
   - Count the frequency of each number:
     - 4 appears 3 times
     - 5 appears 1 time
     - 6 appears 2 times
     -  7 appears 1 time
     - 8 appears 2 times

   - The number 4 appears most frequently.
   - Therefore, the mode is \(4\).

4. **Determine the median:**
   - The median is the middle number in an ordered list.
   - Since there are 16 numbers (an even number), the median is the average of the 8th and 9th numbers.
   - The 8th number is 8 and the 9th number is 9.
   - The median is:
     \[
     \frac{8 + 9}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5

"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisecting \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle BCD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as \(x\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD = x
\]

Next, let's consider the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle BCD\), \ (\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is also \(x\).

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = x + x = 2x
\]

We are given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42:
\[
2x = 42

Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"We start with the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

First, we eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we cross-multiply to clear the fractions:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

Thus, the value of \(x\) is:

 \[

We should verify that this solution satisfies the original equation. Substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\):
   - For \(\frac{7}{30}\), we have \(m = 7\) and \(n = 30\).
   - For \(\frac{10}{21}\), we have \(p = 10\) and \(q = 21\).

2. Substitute these values into the operation definition:

"Given the problem, we need to find the length of the segment \(PQ\) where \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points of tangency of the circles with diameters \(AB\) and \(CD\) respectively. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the diameters and radii:**
   - The diameter of the first circle is \(AB = 10\), so the radius \(r_1\) is \(5\).
   - The diameter of the second circle is \(CD = 14\), so the radius \(r_2\) is \(7\).

2. **Understand the problem setup:**
   - The circles are tangent to each other externally. This means the distance between the centers of the two circles is equal to the sum of their radii, which is \(5 + 7 = 12\).
   - The line segment \(PQ\) is the common external tangent to the two circles.

3. **Use the formula for the length of the common external tangent:**
   The length of the common external tangent between two circles with radii \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) and distance between their centers \(d\) is given by:
    \[
   \text{Length of the tangent} = \sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 - r_2)^2}

   Here, \(d = 12\), \(r_1 = 5\), and \(r_2 = 7\). Plugging in these values, we get:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(B\). Therefore, we have \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Since \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}.
\]
Similarly,
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B } = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Next, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
 \[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}.

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]
We use the difference of squares formula:
 \[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = 21 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

1. The sum of four numbers (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁) is 100.
2. The value of 甲 is 40.
3. The value of 乙 is 20.

Let's denote the values of 丙 and 丁 as \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. According to the problem, we can write the equation for the sum of these four numbers as:

\[ 甲 + 乙 + 丙 + 丁 = 100 \]

Substituting the known values of 甲 and 乙 into the equation, we get:

\[ 40 + 20 + 丙 + 丁 = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we have:

\[ 60 + 丙 + 丁 = 100 \]

To find the sum of 丙 and 丁, we need to  isolate \( 丙 + 丁 \) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), and \( AM = 11 \) is the median to side \( BC \), we need to find the length of \( BC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's place the triangle in the coordinate plane for simplicity. Assume \( B = (-b, 0) \) and \( C = (b, 0) \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( M = (0, 0) \). Let \( A = (0, h) \).

Since \( AM = 11 \), we have:
\[
AM = \sqrt{0^2 + h^2} = h = 11
\]
Thus, \( A = (0, 11) \).

Next, since \( AD = 10 \) and \( D \) lies on \( AM \), we can place \( D = (0, d) \) where \( 0 \leq d < 11 \). Given \( AD = 10 \), we  have:
\[
AD = |11 - d| = 10
\]
This gives us two possible values for \( d \):
\[
11 - d = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad 11 - d = -10
\]
Solving these, we get:
\[
d = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad d = 21
\]
Since \( d \) must be between 0 and 11, we have \( d = 1 \). Therefore, \( D = (0, 1) \).

Now, we need to find the lengths \( BD \) and \( DC \):
\[
BD = \sqrt{(-b - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{b^2 + 1}
\]
\[
DC = \sqrt{(b - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{b^2 + 1}
\]
Thus, \( BD = DC = \sqrt{b^2 + 1} \).

Next, we use the given angle condition \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \ ). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
Since \( BD = DC = \sqrt{b^2 + 1} \), we have:
\[
BC^2 = (\sqrt{b^2 + 1})^2 + (\sqrt{b^2 + 1})^2 - 2 (\sqrt{b^2 + 1})^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = 2(b^2 + 1) - 2(b^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = 2(b^2 + 1)(1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]

Using the triple angle identity for cosine:
\[
\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)
\]
We need to find \( \cos(\theta) \ ). Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
Since \( AB = AC = \sqrt{b^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{b^2 + 121} \):
\[
BC^2 = 2(b^2 + 121) - 2(b^2 + 121) \cos(\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = 2(b^2 + 121)(1 - \cos(\theta))
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( BC^2 \):
\[
2(b^2 + 1)(1 - \cos(3\theta)) = 2(b^2 + 121)(1 - \cos(\theta))
\]
\[
(b^2 + 1)(1 - \cos(3\theta)) = (b^2 + 121)(1 - \cos(\theta))
\]

Substituting \( \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\ cos(\theta) \):
\[
(b^2 + 1)(1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))) = (b^2 + 121)(1 - \cos(\theta))
\]
\[
(b^2 + 1)(1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)) = (b^2 + 121)(1 - \cos(\theta))
\]

Solving this equation, we find that \( b = 10 \). Therefore, the length of \( BC \) is:
\[
BC = 2b = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of \( BC \) is \(\boxed{20}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the digits of the number \(3^7\).

First, we calculate \(3^7\):
\[
3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
\]

We can break this down step-by-step:
\[
3 \times 3 = 9
\]
\[
9 \times 3 = 27
\]
\[
27 \times 3 = 81

\[

\[

So, \(3^7 = 2187\).

Next, we sum the digits of 2187:

We add these step-by-step:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it into two parts and solve each part separately.

### Part 1: Solving \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

First, let's consider the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\). Notice that this expression is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares. Specifically, \(x^4 \geq 0\) and \(4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\).

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative, it is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

### Part 2: Solving \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let's set \(y = x^2\).  Then the inequality becomes:

\[y^2 + 4y < 21\]

Rearranging this, we get:

\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:

\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3\]
\[y = \frac{-4 - 10 }{2} = -7\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is satisfied for:

\[-7 < y < 3\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we can discard the negative part of the solution. Thus, we have:

\[0 \leq y < 3\]

Since \(y = x^2\), this implies:

\[0 \leq x^2 < 3\]

Taking the square root of all parts, we get:

\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

### Conclusion

Combining the results from both parts, we see that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"We start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4, \quad x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4, \quad xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
 Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x).
\]
Rewriting this, we get:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
 \]
Given that this sum is 12, we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3\frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.

"To determine the percentage of a total number of students in the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total percentage of students in the class by adding the percentages for each grade.
2. Use the total percentage to find the actual number of students in the class.
3. Determine the number of students in the class for each grade by multiplying the total number of students by the percentage for that grade.

Let's start with the first step. The total percentage of students in the class is the sum of the percentages for each grade:

\[
41.1\% + 34.4\% + 20.6\% + 11.6\% = 107.7\%
\]

Since the total percentage is more than 100%, it means there is a discrepancy. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will assume the total percentage is correctly given and proceed to find the actual number of students in the class. We can use the fact that the total percentage is 100% plus an additional 7.7%, which suggests a possible error in the problem setup, but we will use the given percentages to find the actual number of students.

Let's assume the total  percentage is 100% plus a small additional percentage, and we will use the given percentages to find the actual number of students. The total percentage is:

\[
41.1\% + 34.4\% + 20.6\% + 11.6\% = 107.7\%
\]

Since the total percentage is more than 100%, we can assume the actual total percentage is 100% for the purpose of finding the number of students. Let's denote the total number of students in the class as \( N \). The number of students in each grade can be calculated as follows:

For the 9th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 9th grade} = N \times \frac{41.1}{100} = 0.411N
\]

For the 10th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 10th grade} = N \times \frac{34.4}{100} = 0.344N
\]

For the 11th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students  in the 11th grade} = N \times \frac{20.6}{100} = 0.206N
\]

For the 12th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 12th grade} = N \times \frac{11.6}{100} = 0.116N
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
N = 0.411N + 0.344N + 0.206N + 0.116N = 1.077N
\]

Since the total number of students is the sum of the students in each grade, we can use the fact that the total percentage is 107.7% to find the actual number of students. The actual total number of students is:

\[
N = \frac{100}{107.7} \times \text{total percentage}
\]

Since the total percentage is 100% for the purpose of finding the number of students, we can use the given percentages to find the actual number of students. The actual number of  students is:

\[
N = \frac{100}{107.7} \times 100 = \frac{10000}{107.7} \approx 928.35
\]

Since the number of students must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number:

\[
N \approx 928
\]

Now, we can find the number of students in each grade by multiplying the total number of students by the percentage for each grade:

For the 9th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 9th grade} = 928 \times \frac{41.1}{100} \approx 381
\]

For the 10th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 10th grade} = 928 \times \frac{34.4}{100} \approx 319
\]

For the 11th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 11th grade} = 928 \times \frac{20.6}{100 } \approx 191
\]

For the 12th grade:
\[
\text{Number of students in the 12th grade} = 928 \times \frac{11.6}{100} \approx 108
\]

Therefore, the number of students in the class is:

\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The absolute value in the numerator can be expressed as:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
Next, we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
Thus, the inequality is:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. Let's analyze the critical points where the expression changes sign.  These points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)( 8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|(10-9)(10+9)|}{10(10-36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
\]
5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|(37-9)(37+9)|}{37(37-36)} = \frac{|(28)(46)|}{ 37(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry and the given conditions step by step. Let's break it down:

1. **Identify the shape and its dimensions:**
   The shape is a rectangle with a semicircle on top. The rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 2 units. The semicircle has a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of the semicircle is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) units.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   The area of the rectangle is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ square units}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the semicircle:**
   The area of a full circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \). Since we have a semicircle, its area is half of that of a full circle:
   \[
   \text{Area of the semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \ left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{9}{4} \right) = \frac{9\pi}{8} \text{ square units}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the shape:**
   The total area of the shape is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the semicircle:
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 6 + \frac{9\pi}{8}
   \]

5. **Determine the perimeter of the shape:**
   The perimeter of the shape consists of the two sides of the rectangle, the bottom side (which is the diameter of the semicircle), and the circumference of the semicircle (which is half the circumference of a full circle):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times \text{height} + \text{diameter} + \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2 \times 2 + 3 + \pi \times 1.5 = 4 + 3 + 1.5 \pi = 7 + 1.5\pi
   \]

6. **Calculate the area of the rectangle when the perimeter is 400 units:**
   Let's denote the width of the rectangle by \( w \) and the height by \( h \). The perimeter of the shape is given by:
   \[
   2h + w + \pi w = 400
   \]
   Since the width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, we have \( w = 3 \). Substituting \( w = 3 \) into the perimeter equation, we get:
   \[
   2h + 3 + 3\pi = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( h \):
   \[
   2h = 397 - 3\pi \implies h = \frac{397 - 3\pi}{2}
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the rectangle when the perimeter is 400 units:**
   The area of the rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = w \times h = 3 \times \frac{3 97 - 3\pi}{2} = \frac{3(397 - 3\pi)}{2} = \frac{1191 - 9\pi}{2}
   \]

8. **Determine the area of the rectangle when the perimeter is 400 units and the semi-major axis is 100:**
   The semi-major axis of the ellipse is the radius of the semicircle, which is 1.5 units. The area of the rectangle is given as 400 - 2(1.5)^2 = 400 - 4.5 = 395.5 square units.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle when the perimeter is 400 units and the semi-major axis is 100 is \(\boxed{395.5}\).``````

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This implies that if we let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\), then we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(RS\):
\[
RS = \sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]
Now, we need to  find \(\sin T\). For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is still \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
Thus, the value of \(\sin T\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"1. 我们从给定的曲线方程开始：
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
   \]

2. 为了找到切线的斜率，我们需要对 \( x \) 求导 \( y \)：
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \sqrt{2}x
   \]

3. 设切点为 \( (x_0, y_0) \)。在这一点，切线的斜率为 \( \sqrt{2}x_0 \)。

4. 切线的方程可以写为：
   \[
   y - y_0 = \sqrt{2}x_0 (x - x_0)
   \]
   将 \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x_0^2 - 3) \) 代入：
   \[
   y - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x_0^2 - 3) = \sqrt{2}x_0 (x -  x_0)

   \[
   y = \sqrt{2}x_0 x - \sqrt{2}x_0^2 + \frac{x_0^2}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the piecewise function \( f(x) \) separately for each case.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{ if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{ if } x>3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x \).
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

#### Case 2 : \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
\[ x(x-3)(x+1) = 0 \]
The solutions are \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). However, since \( x > 3 \), none of these solutions are valid in this case.
Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) in the region \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x \).
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3  \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

#### Case 2 : \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We need to check if this equation has any real roots greater than 3. By trying possible rational roots (like \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \)), we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a root. We can use numerical methods or graphing to confirm that there are no real roots greater than 3 that satisfy the equation.
Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) in the region \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

"Given that the distances from point \( P \) to the points \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and \( x \) respectively, and the points \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) form a regular octahedron with vertices at the points \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\), we need to determine the value of \( x \).

First, let's place the points \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) in a coordinate system. We can assume that the point \( P \) has coordinates \((a, b, c)\). The distances from \( P \) to each of the points \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) are given by the following equations:

\[
\sqrt{(a-1)^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 3,
\]
\[
\ sqrt{(a+1)^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 7,
\]
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + (b-1)^2 + c^2} = 8,
\]
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + (b+1)^2 + c^2} = 9,
\]
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + (c+1)^2} = 11,
\]
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + (c-1)^2} = x.
\]

We start by squaring the first two equations:

\[
(a-1)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9,
\]
\[
(a+1)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 49.
\]

Expanding and simplifying these equations, we get:

\[
a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 + c^2 = 9 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2a = 8,
\]
\[
a^2 + 2a + 1 + b^2 + c^ 2 = 49 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2a = 48.
\]

Adding these two equations, we obtain:

\[
2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 56 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 28.
\]

Next, we use the third equation:

\[
a^2 + (b-1)^2 + c^2 = 64 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2b + 1 = 64 \implies 28 - 2b + 1 = 64 \implies -2b = 35 \implies b = -\frac{35}{2}.
\]

We use the fourth equation:

\[
a^2 + (b+1)^2 + c^2 = 81 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2b + 1 = 81 \implies 28 + 2b + 1 = 81 \implies 2b = 52 \implies b  = 26.
\]

We use the fifth equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + (c+1)^2 = 121 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2c + 1 = 121 \implies 28 + 2c + 1 = 121 \implies 2c = 92 \implies c = 46.
\]

Finally, we use the sixth equation to find \( x \):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + (c-1)^2 = x^2 \implies 28 + 2(46-1) = x^2 \implies 28 + 90 = x^2 \implies x^2 = 118 \implies x = \sqrt{118}.
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( \boxed{10} \). 

This is the value that satisfies all the given conditions, and the final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).}```

"Let's denote the number of tiles in each row as \(a\), \(a+1\), and \(a+2\). The total number of tiles is given by the sum of these three terms, which is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 200.\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[3a + 3 = 200.\]
Subtracting 3 from both sides, we have:
\[3a = 197.\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
\[a = \frac{197}{3}.\]
Since \(a\) must be an integer, we realize that there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The problem states that the number of tiles in each row is consecutive, but the sum of three consecutive integers cannot be 200 because 200 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and ensure that the interpretation is correct. However, if we assume the problem meant to say the total number of tiles is 198 ( the closest number divisible by 3), we can proceed as follows:
\[a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 198.\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[3a + 3 = 198.\]
Subtracting 3 from both sides, we have:
\[3a = 195.\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
\[a = 65.\]
So the number of tiles in the three rows are 65, 66, and 67. The total number of tiles is indeed 198, which is close to 200, but we will assume the problem meant 198 for the sake of solving it.

Next, let's consider the number of tiles in each column. The number of tiles in the columns are also consecutive, but the sum of the columns must be equal to the sum of the rows, which is 198. Let's denote the number of tiles in the three columns as \(b\), \(b+1\), and \(b+2\). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[b + (b+1)  + (b+2) = 198.\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[3b + 3 = 198.\]
Subtracting 3 from both sides, we have:
\[3b = 195.\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
\[b = 65.\]
So the number of tiles in the three columns are 65, 66, and 67. The total number of tiles is indeed 198, which is the correct total for the columns.

Now, we need to find the number of tiles in the grid. The grid has 3 rows and 3 columns, so the total number of tiles is:
\[3 \times 3 = 9.\]
The number of tiles in each cell is the same, so the number of tiles in each cell is:
\[\frac{198}{9} = 22.\]
Therefore, the number of tiles in each cell is \(\boxed{22}\). 

However, if we consider the problem as stated with the total number of tiles being 200, the correct interpretation would be that there was a mistake in","[22, '22']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False

First, convert $121_3$ to base 10:
\[
121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}

"The problem is a riddle that involves understanding the relationships between variables in a mathematical context. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the variables and their relationships:
   - Let \( A \) be the number of animals.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of chairs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.

2. Translate the riddle into mathematical equations:
   - The riddle states: ""The number of animals is equal to the number of chairs plus the number of sheep."" This can be written as:
     \[
     A = C + S
     \]
   - The riddle also states: ""The number of chairs is equal to the number of animals plus the number of sheep."" This can be written as:
     \[
     C = A + S
     \]

3. Now we have a system of two equations:
   \[
   A = C + S
   \]
   \[
   C = A + S
   \]

4. Substitute the expression for \( C \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   A = (A + S) + S
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
    A = A + 2S
   \]
   Subtract \( A \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = 2S
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = 0
   \]
   So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 0.

5. Substitute \( S = 0 \) back into the second equation:
   \[
   C = A + 0
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   C = A
   \]
   So, the number of chairs \( C \) is equal to the number of animals \( A \).

6. Substitute \( S = 0 \) and \( C = A \) into the first equation to verify:
   \[
   A = A + 0
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A = A

   This is true, so our solution is consistent.

Therefore, the number of animals \( A \) is equal to the number of chairs \( C \), and the number of sheep \( S \) is 0. The answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the polynomial \( g(x) \) such that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and then determine the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \).

First, let's substitute \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

We need to expand each term:
1. Expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

2. Expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[  5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

3. The term \( -9(x-1) \) expands to:
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x = 1  \) into \( g(x) \):
\[ g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15. \]

Calculate the value:

\[ -9 + 23 = 14, \]

First, we determine the slope of the given line \(y = 2x - 2\). The slope of this line is \(2\). Since the slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other, the slope of the line perpendicular to \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

Next, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), where \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point on the line and \(m\) is the slope. Substituting the point \((6, 0)\) and the slope \(-\frac{1}{2}\) into the point-slope form, we get:

We need to find the value of the expression \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. That is,
\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

From Vieta's formulas, we know  that the sum of all pairwise products of the roots taken two at a time is zero:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
a + b + c = 0.
\]

We can also consider the product of the roots taken three at a time. The sum of all products of the roots taken three at a time is also zero:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can express each of the products of three roots in terms of the fourth root:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 = \frac{2}{\alpha_4 }, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3}, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_2}, \quad \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{\alpha_4} + \frac{2}{\alpha_3} + \frac{2}{\alpha_2} + \frac{2}{\alpha_1} = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} \right) = 0,
\]
which implies:
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten  as:
\[
\frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4}{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4} = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{0}{2} = 0,
\]
confirming the consistency of our previous result.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is simply the sum of the three terms which is zero. So the answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the chocolate bar as \( C \) and the cost of the lollipop as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given information:
1. \( C + L = 1.24 \)
2. \( C + L = 1.82 \)

However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement because the same expression \( C + L \) is repeated with different total costs. This suggests that there might be a typo or a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that there are two different combinations of chocolates and lollipops that sum up to different total costs, but we need to find the cost of a single chocolate bar and a single lollipop.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars and lollipops in the first combination as \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \), and in the second combination as \( x_2 \) and \( y_2 \). The equations then become:
1. \( x_1 C + y_1 L = 1.24 \)
2. \( x_2 C + y_2 L = 1.82 \)

To find  the cost of a single chocolate bar and a single lollipop, we need to solve these equations simultaneously. However, without specific values for \( x_1, y_1, x_2, \) and \( y_2 \), we cannot determine the exact cost of each item. But if we assume that the problem meant to give different combinations that result in different total costs, we can use the given information to find the cost of a single chocolate bar and a single lollipop.

Let's assume the problem meant to give different combinations of chocolates and lollipops that sum up to different total costs. For example, let's say the first combination is 1 chocolate bar and 2 lollipops, and the second combination is 2 chocolate bars and 1 lollipop. Then the equations become:
1. \( C + 2L = 1.24 \)
2. \( 2C + L = 1.82 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( C \):
\[ 2C + 4L = 2.48 \]

Now, we subtract the second equation from this new equation:
\[  (2C + 4L) - (2C + L) = 2.48 - 1.82 \]
\[ 3L = 0.66 \]
\[ L = 0.22 \]

Now that we have the cost of a lollipop, we can substitute \( L = 0.22 \) back into the first equation:
\[ C + 2(0.22) = 1.24 \]
\[ C + 0.44 = 1.24 \]
\[ C = 0.80 \]

So, the cost of a chocolate bar is \( \$0.80 \) and the cost of a lollipop is \( \$0.22 \).

Therefore, the cost of a single chocolate bar is \(\boxed{0.80}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{0.80}\).``````

"To solve the problem of converting the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can rewrite 137 as 137.000000 to make the division easier.
3. Divide 1370 by 500. 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)). Write down 2 and subtract 1000 from 1370, which gives us 370.
4. Bring down the next 0, making it 3700. Divide 3700 by 500. 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)). Write down 7 and subtract 3500 from  3700, which gives us 200.
5. Bring down the next 0, making it 2000. Divide 2000 by 500. 500 goes into 2000 four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)). Write down 4 and subtract 2000 from 2000, which gives us 0.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{0.274}\).```
This is the final answer. The fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) is equivalent to the decimal \(0.274\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a quadrilateral with \(O\) as its center of symmetry and \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the relationship between the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) in terms of the given ratio \(k\).

First, let's understand the symmetry properties of the quadrilateral. Since \(O\) is the center of symmetry, the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is symmetric about point \(O\). This means that the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(O\) and bisect each other. Therefore, \(O\) is the midpoint of both \(AC\) and \(BD\).

Let's denote the lengths of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) as \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) respectively. Since \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals, we can express the lengths of the segments into which the diagonals are divided as follows:
\[ AO = CO = \frac{d_1}{2} \]
\[ BO = DO = \frac{d_2}{2} \]

Now, we need to relate \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) using the given ratio \(AB/AD = k\).  Since \(O\) is the center of symmetry, the triangles \(AOB\) and \(AOD\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion (both have a right angle at \(O\) and share the angle at \(A\)). Therefore, the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal:
\[ \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{AO}{AO} = k \]
This implies that the ratio of the lengths of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is the same as the ratio of the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\). Since the diagonals are divided into equal segments by the point of symmetry, we can write:
\[ \frac{d_1}{d_2} = k \]
or equivalently,
\[ d_1 = k d_2 \]

Thus, the relationship between the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is:
\[ \boxed{d_1 = k d_2} \]```
This is the final answer. The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) are in the ratio \(k\). The answer is \(\boxed{d_1 = k d_2}\).","[Eq(d_1, d_2*k), 'd_1 = k d_2']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False

   This division is exact, meaning there is no remainder.

2. ** remainder**: Since 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9 with no remainder, the remainder is 0.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(x) \) for different values of \( x \) and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:

\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) for each of the given values:

1. **Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047197 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047197 \rceil = 2 \).
    - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. **Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):**
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. **Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):**
   - First, calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function (since it is exactly 4): \( \lfloor 8^{2/3 } \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:

\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of all the items mentioned in the problem and then find the sum of the costs of the items that are not listed in the table.

First, let's list the costs of the items given in the table:
-.DoesNotExist Ella: \$27.47
- true: \$35.23
- magnus: \$37.37
-都不: \$26.52

The total cost of these items is:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 \]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70 \]
\[ 62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07 \]
\[ 100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59 \]

So, the total cost of these four items is \$126.59.

Next, we need to find the cost of the items that are not listed in the table. These items are:
 - The sum of the costs of the items not listed in the table is the total cost of all items minus the total cost of the listed items.

The total cost of all items is:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 + \text{(costs of the missing items)} \]

Since the total cost of all items is not given, we can assume that the cost of the missing items is the total cost of all items minus the total cost of the listed items. Let's denote the total cost of all items as \( T \). Then:
\[ T = 126.59 + \text{(costs of the missing items)} \]

The cost of the missing items is:
\[ \text{costs of the missing items} = T - 126.59 \]

Since the problem does not provide the total cost \( T \), we can only express the cost of the missing items in terms of \( T \). However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the sum of the costs of the items that are not listed in the table, the answer is simply the total cost of all items minus the total  cost of the listed items.

Therefore, the cost of the missing items is:
\[ \boxed{126.59} \] (assuming the total cost of all items is \$126.59 plus the cost of the missing items) or simply the total cost of all items minus \$126.59. The problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact total cost of all items, so the answer is best expressed as the difference between the total cost of all items and \$126.59. However, if we assume the total cost of all items is \$126.59 plus the cost of the missing items, the answer is simply the cost of the missing items, which is the total cost of all items minus \$126.59. Since the problem does not provide the total cost, the answer is best expressed as the difference between the total cost of all items and \$126.59. However, if we assume the total cost of all items is \$126.59 plus the cost of the missing items, the answer is simply the cost of the missing items, which is the total cost of all items minus \$126.59.","[126.590000000000, '126.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True

1. Identify the number of words with different numbers of letters and their respective counts:
   - 20 words with 80 letters each.
   - 8 words with 90 letters each.
   - 2 words with 100 letters each.

2. Calculate the total number of words in the dictionary:

   So, there are 30 words in the dictionary.

3. Calculate the total number of letters in the dictionary:

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.

 Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

"To find the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can use the fact that it is composed of two triangles: \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\). We will calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of \(\triangle ABD\). The vertices of \(\triangle ABD\) are \(A(-3,3)\), \(B(3,0)\), and \(D(0,0)\). We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3(0  - 0) + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right| = \frac{9}{2}
