"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall that the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \( \sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} \). Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \), we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
From the diagram, we know that \( DF = 7 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
To find \( DE \), we solve for \( DE \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \( \boxed{10} \).```

"To solve for \( w \), we need to find the complex number that results from rotating \( z \) counterclockwise by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians (45 degrees) around the point \( c \).

First, let's express \( z \) and \( c \) in the complex plane:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

We start by translating \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin. This involves subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \]
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (- (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i) \]
\[ z - c = \sqrt{2} - (3\sqrt{2} + 3 - 3)i \]
\[ z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i  \]

Next, we rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). The rotation of a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
\[ (a + bi) \cdot (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \]

For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
\[ \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the rotation is:
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \]
\[  = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Now, we need to translate \( w \) back by adding \( c \):
\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) \]
\[ w = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i \]
\[ w = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \] 

This is the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating \( z \) counterclockwise by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians around the point \( c \). The solution is verified through the rotation and translation steps. The final answer is \( w = 6 - 5i \). 

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \] 

This solution is verified through the rotation and translation steps. The final answer is \( w = 6 - 5i \). The answer is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify $\sqrt{242}$, we first factorize 242 into its prime factors:

1. $242 = 2 \times 121$
2. $121 = 11 \times 11$

So, we can rewrite $\sqrt{242}$ as $\sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}$.

Next, we can simplify the square root by taking out pairs of identical factors:

1. $\sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2}$
2. Since $\sqrt{11^2} = 11$, we can simplify further: $11\sqrt{2}$

Therefore, the simplified form of $\sqrt{242}$ is $\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}$.```

"The reference solution to the given problem is: "" otherwise, the answer is 0. Otherwise, the answer is 1. "" This can be translated to: "" otherwise, the answer is 0. Otherwise, the answer is 1. "" This statement seems to be a simple conditional statement that checks if a certain condition is met. If the condition is not met, the answer is 0. If the condition is met, the answer is 1. 

To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the reference solution step by step:

1. The reference solution checks if a certain condition is met.
2. If the condition is not met, the answer is 0.
3. If the condition is met, the answer is 1.

This can be implemented in a programming language like Python as follows:

```python

"To find the term independent of \(x\) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that does not contain \(x\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k = \binom{5 }{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero for the term to be independent of \(x\). Therefore, we set the exponent equal to zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the coefficient of the term independent of \(x\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 (100) \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right ) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \cdot -\frac{25}{2} = -125

\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}

\[

Now, calculate the product step by step:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) that lies in the region defined by the inequalities corresponding to the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and where \(x > 7\).

First, let's determine the inequalities that define the region. The points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\) are on the boundary of the region. We can use these points to find the equations of the lines that form the boundaries of the region.

1. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):**
   The slope \(m\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
   \]
   Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with the point \((5, 3)\), we get:
   \[
   y - 3  = 5(x - 5) \implies y - 3 = 5x - 25 \implies y = 5x - 22
   \]

2. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):**
   The slope \(m\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = -4
   \]
   Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with the point \((6, 8)\), we get:
   \[
   y - 8 = -4(x - 6) \implies y - 8 = -4x + 24 \implies y = -4x + 32
   \]

3. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((7, 4)\) and \((5, 3)\):**
   The slope \(m\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{3 - 4}{5 - 7} = \frac{-1 }{-2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with the point \((7, 4)\), we get:
   \[
   y - 4 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 7) \implies y - 4 = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{7}{2} \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
   \]

The region is bounded by these three lines. Since we are looking for a point \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), we need to determine which side of the lines this region lies on. By examining the inequalities, we find that the region where \(x > 7\) is bounded by the lines \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = -4x + 32\).

To find the intersection of the lines \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = -4x + 32\), we set the equations equal to each  other:
\[
5x - 22 = -4x + 32 \implies 9x = 54 \implies x = 6
\]
Substituting \(x = 6\) into either equation to find \(y\):
\[
y = 5(6) - 22 = 30 - 22 = 8
\]
So, the intersection point is \((6, 8)\). Since we need \(x > 7\), we look at the region where \(x > 7\) and \(y < 5x - 22\) and \(y > -4x + 32\). The point \((8, 5)\) is a valid point in this region. Therefore, we substitute \(x = 8\) and \(y = 5\) into \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 5 = 13
\]
Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{13}\). \)```

So, the function can be rewritten as:

The function has vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero, which occurs at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). These are the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote of the function. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of  the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). This means \( c = 0 \).

\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\).

First, let's compute the norm of \( A \). The norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A^T A \).

Calculate \( A^T A \):

Next, find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation:

Solve the quadratic equation:

\[
\lambda = 16 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = 1

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that

Thus, the answer is:

\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the result back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

### Final Answer

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator here is \(\cos x \sin x\). So we rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the terms into a single fraction:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So we substitute this  into the expression:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

This is the same as the cotangent function, \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"Given the polynomials:
\[ 3t^2 + 5t + a \]
\[ 4t^2 + bt - 2 \]
and their sum:
\[ 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

We need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and then find \(a + b\).

First, let's write the sum of the given polynomials:
\[ (3t^2 + 5t + a) + (4t^2 + bt - 2) \]

Combine the like terms:
\[ 3t^2 + 4t^2 + 5t + bt + a - 2 \]
\[ = 7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2) \]

We know this must equal the given polynomial:
\[ 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

Since the degrees of the polynomials do not match, there seems to be an error in the problem statement. Let's instead assume the problem meant to provide the product of the pol ynomials instead of their sum.

Let's find the product of the given polynomials:
\[ (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \]

Using the distributive property (FOIL method for polynomials):
\[ = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2) \]

Expand each term:
\[ = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a \]

Combine the like terms:
\[ = 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a \]

We know this must equal the given polynomial:
\[ 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

By comparing coefficients, we get  the following system of equations:
1. \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
2. \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
3. \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
4. \( -2a = 6 \)

Solve the fourth equation for \(a\):
\[ -2a = 6 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation:
\[ 3b + 20 = 26 \]
\[ 3b = 6 \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Verify with the second and third equations:
\[ -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \] (True)
\[ -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16 \] (True)

Thus, \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
\[ a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:
\[ \ boxed{-1} \]```

"Given that the area of the circle is \(20\pi\), we can start by recalling the formula for the area of a circle:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

where \(A\) is the area and \(r\) is the radius of the circle. We are given that the area \(A = 20\pi\). So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\pi r^2 = 20\pi
\]

To find the radius, we can divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi\):

\[
r^2 = 20
\]

Next, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \(r\):

\[
r = \sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \times 5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the radius of the circle is:

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the value of the function at \(x = a\) are all equal. The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:

\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

First, we calculate the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):

\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

Next, we calculate the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\ ):

\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

Since \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\), we need the left-hand limit to equal the right-hand limit:

\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:

\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three potential solutions:

\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.
\]

However, \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution because it would make the function a simple linear function, and the problem specifies that \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function for \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we discard \(a = 0\).

We are left with \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\).  To determine which value of \(a\) is correct, we need to check the context of the problem. Since the problem does not specify any additional conditions, we consider both values. However, typically in such problems, the positive value is preferred unless otherwise specified.

2. 对于 \(x\) 的项：
   \[
   x^2 - 10x
   \]
   为了完成平方，我们取 \(x\) 的系数的一半，即 \(-10\)，除以 2 得到 \(-5\)，然后平方得到 \(25\)。因此，我们有：

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \). We need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(f(x) \neq x\) to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\), \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must be outside the interval \([0,1]\).  This means:
\[ \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 1. \]
The first inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 0\) is true for \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\). The second inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 1\) simplifies to:
\[ \lambda - 1 \geq \lambda \implies -1 \geq 0, \]
which is never true. Therefore, the only valid range for \(\lambda\) is \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\).

Next, we need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\) holds for \(\lambda\) in this range. We compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 -  x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
For \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), it is clear that \(f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0\) and \(f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0\), so the equation holds. For \(x \in (0,1)\), we need:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1. \]
For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[ f(x) = 2x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad f(f(x)) = 2(2x(1 - x))(1 - 2x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This can be verified by substitution, showing that \(f(f(x)) = x\) holds for \(\lambda = 2\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the conditions is:

"To solve the given expression for \(\tan \theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The given expression is:

\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\ ), to combine the terms. Notice that:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ
\]

So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), to combine the terms.  Notice that:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ
\]

So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\)  and \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\). Also, \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we know that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\ right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ

\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:

\[ 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 \]

First, we need to rewrite this equation in the standard form of an ellipse. The standard form of an ellipse is:

\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

To convert the given equation into this standard form, we divide every term by 36:

\[ \frac{4x^2}{36} + \frac{9y^2}{36} = \frac{36}{36} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{x^2}{9} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we can see that this is indeed the standard form of an ellipse, where \( a^2 = 9 \) and \( b^2 = 4 \). Therefore, \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \).

The properties of the ellipse are:
- The center of the ellipse is at \((0 , 0)\).
- The lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes are \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \), respectively.
- The distance from the center to each focus is given by \( c \), where \( c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{9 - 4} = \sqrt{5} \).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

For \(42!\) and the prime number 5, we calculate:

\[

All higher terms are zero because \(125 > 42\).

"Given the function:
\[ f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
we need to find the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) within the domain \( -1 \leq x, y \leq 1 \).

1. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   Let \( x = \sin \alpha \) and \( y = \sin \beta \). Then:
   \[
   f(x, y) = \sin \alpha \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} + \sin \beta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha}
   \]
   Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \), we get:

   f(x, y) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha

   Recognizing the trigonometric addition formula, we rewrite this as:
   \[
   f(x, y) = \sin(\alpha + \beta)
   \]

2. **Range of the Sine Function**:
    The sine function, \( \sin(\theta) \), ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\):
   \[
   -1 \leq \sin(\alpha + \beta) \leq 1
   \]
   Therefore, the range of \( f(x, y) \) is:
   \[
   -1 \leq f(x, y) \leq 1
   \]

3. **Maximum Value**:
   The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is achieved when \( \sin(\alpha + \beta) = 1 \):
   \[

Conclusion: The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) in the given domain is:

"Given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the area of triangle \(OAB\).

The area of triangle \(OAB\) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\|
\]

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
 \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i} \left(2 + 6\right) = 8\mathbf{i}
\]
\[
-\mathbf{j} \left(1 + 9\right) = -10\mathbf{j}
\]
\[
\mathbf{k} \left(-2 + 6\right) = 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of  this vector:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}
\]``````

The final answer is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\). This is the area of the triangle \(OAB\). The steps involve finding the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), calculating its magnitude, and then using the formula for the area of a triangle formed","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a root of a specific quadratic equation. The expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \). Let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Then, \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are the roots of the equation \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \).

The roots of this quadratic equation are:
\[ z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{ 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5 - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

However, we don't need the explicit form of \( z \) to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Instead , we use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) satisfy the recurrence relation derived from the quadratic equation \( z^2 = \alpha z - 1 \). This implies that \( z^{n+1} + \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} = \alpha \left( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \right) - \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) \).

Let's define \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). Then, we have the recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = \alpha a_n - a_{n-1}. \]
We know that \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \alpha \). We can use the recurrence relation to find \( a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{85} \).

First, we calculate \( a_2 \):
\[ a_2 = \alpha a_1 - a_0 = \alpha^2 - 2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5 }}{2} \right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Next, we calculate \( a_3 \):
\[ a_3 = \alpha a_2 - a_1 = \alpha \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) - \alpha = \alpha \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5} - 2}{2} \right) = \alpha \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-3 + \sqrt{5}) }{4} = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5} - 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We observe that \( a_3 = -a_1 \) and \( a_4 = -a_2 \). This pattern continues, and we can see that \( a_{2k} = (-1)^k a_2 \) and \( a_{2k+1} = (-1)^k a_1 \). Therefore, \( a_{85} = (-1)^{42} a_1 = a_1 = \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} \). \end{document} \]

"Given that \( n > 1 \) and \( n^{\text{th}} \) root of \( 2^{24} \) is an integer, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that \( n^{\text{th}} \) root of \( 2^{24} \) is an integer. This means that \( 2^{24} \) must be a perfect \( n \)-th power, and hence \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. Let's express this mathematically:

\[ n^{\text{th}} \sqrt{2^{24}} = 2^{24/n} \]

For \( 2^{24/n} \) to be an integer, \( 24/n \) must be an integer. This means \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Since \( n > 1 \), the possible values for \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,  12, and 24.

We need to find the \( n \)-th root of \( 2^{24} \) for each of these values of \( n \):

1. If \( n = 2 \), then the 2nd root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/2} = 2^{12} \).
2. If \( n = 3 \), then the 3rd root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/3} = 2^8 \).
3. If \( n = 4 \), then the 4th root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/4} = 2^6 \).
4. If \( n = 6 \), then the 6th root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/6} = 2^4 \).
5. If \( n = 8 \), then the 8th root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/8} = 2^3 \).
 6. If \( n = 12 \), then the 12th root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/12} = 2^2 \).
7. If \( n = 24 \), then the 24th root of \( 2^{24} \) is \( 2^{24/24} = 2^1 = 2 \).

In each case, the \( n \)-th root of \( 2^{24} \) is an integer. However, the problem asks for the value of the \( n \)-th root when it is an integer, and the smallest such \( n \) greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, the value of the \( n \)-th root is:

To solve for \( b \) in the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) given that \( a = 4 \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. Solve for \( y \), which we will call \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( 2b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 12 + 2b - 12 = 12 - 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2b = 0 \]

Now, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ b = 0 \]

First, let's identify the dimensions of the large rectangle. The large rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. Therefore, the area of the large rectangle is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the two shaded triangles. The first triangle is a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The area of this triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

The second triangle is also a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area of this triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

The total area of the two shaded triangles is:
\[
6 + 4 = 10 \text{ square units}
\]

 The shaded portion in the diagram is the area of the large rectangle minus the area of the two shaded triangles. Therefore, the area of the shaded portion is:
\[
12 - 10 = 2 \text{ square units}
\]

Thus, the area of the shaded portion is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Venn diagram and understand the relationships between the sets. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the sets and their intersections:**
   - The Venn diagram has three circles representing sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
   - The intersections of these sets are labeled with the numbers of elements in those intersections.

2. **Extract the information from the Venn diagram:**
   - The number of elements in \(A \cap B\) is 3.
   - The number of elements in \(A \cap C\) is 2.
   - The number of elements in \(B \cap C\) is 4.
   - The number of elements in \(A \cap B \cap C\) is 1.

3. **Calculate the total number of elements in the union of the three sets:**
   - We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets:
     \[
     |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C |
     \]

4. **Determine the number of elements in each set:**
   - From the Venn diagram, we can see:
     - Set \(A\) contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5.
     - Set \(B\) contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6.
     - Set \(C\) contains the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6.

   - Therefore, the number of elements in each set is:
     \[
     |A| = 4, \quad |B| = 4, \quad |C| = 4
     \]

5. **Substitute the values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:**
   \[
   |A \cup B \cup C| = 4 + 4 + 4 - 3 - 2 - 4 + 1
   \]

6. **Perform the calculations:**
   \[
   |A \cup B \cup C| = 12 - 9 + 1 = 4
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of elements in the union of the three sets is 4.

 Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve the problem, we need to simplify the expression \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\). Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the denominator, which is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite \(2^8\) as \(2^7 \cdot 2\), so the expression becomes:

\[
5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2
\]

So the expression \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2}
\]

Since \(10^7 = 10000000\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{4321}{10000000 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

 Now, we need to determine if the fraction \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) can be simplified further. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4321 and 20000000 is 1, which means the fraction is already in its simplest form.

"To solve the expression \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the sine function.

First, observe that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite some of the terms in the product:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin  20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore,  the expression becomes:
\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]
Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Using the identity for the product of sines, we have:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{64}.

"Given the equation \(z = c\), we need to identify the geometric shape it represents. Let's analyze the equation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Equation**:
   - The equation \(z = c\) is a simple equation where \(z\) is a constant.
   - This means that for any point \((x, y, z)\) on this shape, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

2. **Visualizing the Shape**:
   - In three-dimensional space, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.
   - This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a height \(z = c\).

3. **Identifying the Shape**:
   - A plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and at a constant height \(z = c\) is known as a horizontal plane.
   - In the given options, the shape that matches this description is a horizontal plane.

4. **Selecting the Correct Option**:

Given the options, the correct term that describes the shape is a horizontal plane.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{C}\). However, since the options provided do not include ""horizontal plane,"" it seems there might be a mistake in the options.

"To determine the cosine of the angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). Given that \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7\), we can substitute the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\),  we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). We need to find \(\cos \theta\). For \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\cos \theta = \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and for \(\theta = 150^\circ\), \(\cos \theta = \cos 150^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

To determine which value of \(\cos \theta\) is correct, we need to consider the dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\). The dot product can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

 However, the dot product is not given directly in the problem, so we can only use the information about the magnitudes and the cross product to determine the cosine. Since the problem does not provide additional information to distinguish between the two possible values of \(\theta\), we can only state the possible values for \(\cos \theta\).

Thus, the cosine of the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

\[

The final answer is:

"Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we need to determine the value of \( g(0) \) where \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \).

First, let's write down the function \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5)
\]

To find \( g(0) \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
g(0) = f(0 + 5) = f(5)
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(5) \) using the given function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \).

Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) \):

\[
f(5) = 5^3 - 49 \cdot 5^2 + 623 \cdot 5 - 2015
\]

Now, calculate each term step by step:

 1. Calculate \( 5^3 \):

\[
5^3 = 125
\]

2. Calculate \( 49 \cdot 5^2 \):

\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad 49 \cdot 25 = 1225
\]

3. Calculate \( 623 \cdot 5 \):

\[
623 \cdot 5 = 3115
\]

4. Combine all the terms:

\[
f(5) = 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015
\]

Now, perform the arithmetic operations:

\[
125 - 1225 = -1100
\]

\[
-1100 + 3115 = 2015
\]

\[
2015 - 2015 = 0
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
f(5) = 0
\]

Therefore, the value of \( g(0) \) is:

\[
g(0) = f(5) = 0

"To solve the given expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of complementary angles.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\). However, a more useful identity here is the Pythagorean identity in a different form, which states that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this  identity, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ).
\]

We can simplify this to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\). This gives us \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan^2 70^\circ = \cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\tan^2 50^\circ = \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

So the expression now is:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 2x = \frac{2\tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2\tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 10^\circ}\). Let \(t = \tan 10^\circ\). Then \(\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\) and \(\tan 40 ^\circ = \frac{2\tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2} = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2} = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}\).

Then \(\tan^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}\right)^2 = \frac{16t^2(1 - t^2)^2}{(1 - 6t^2 + t^4)^2}\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the identity directly. We know from trigonometric product-to-sum identities that the sum of the squares of the tangents of complementary angles in this specific form (where the angles are in arithmetic progression) is a constant. The specific value for this sum  is 9. Therefore, the original expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 6 = 9.
\]

Thus, the value of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{9}.

"命题 walks us through a problem involving angles in a polygon, specifically focusing on the sum of interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is \(1070^\circ\). We need to find the number of sides \(n\) of the polygon. We set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

Next, we solve for \(n\). Start by dividing both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
n-2 = 5.9444\ldots \approx 5.9444 
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest integer, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

Add 2 to both sides to solve for \(n\):

\[
n = 6 + 2 = 8
\]

Thus, the polygon has 8 sides. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

This indicates the polygon is an octagon. If the problem involves finding the number of sides of a polygon given the sum of its exterior angles, the answer would be different. However, based on the given information, the polygon is an octagon.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the integer value of \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the congruence condition**:
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23}
   \]
   This congruence implies that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) leave the same remainder when divided by 23.

2. **Simplify the congruence**:
   Subtract \( t \) from both sides of the congruence:
   \[
   t + 2 - t \equiv t - t \pmod{23}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Interpret the simplified congruence**:
   The congruence \( 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) is not possible because 2 is not divisible by 23. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of  the problem.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem statement**:
   The problem states that \( t + 2 \) is congruent to \( t \) modulo 23. This implies that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) are the same number when considered modulo 23. However, this is not possible for any integer \( t \) in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   Given the constraints \( 0 < t < 23 \) and the requirement that \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \), there is no integer \( t \) that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, the problem as stated has no solution. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\] (This indicates that there is no valid \( t \) in the given range that satisfies the given conditions.)```python

"To determine if the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, we need to find a quadratic equation for which \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is a root. If \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is a root, then its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\) must also be a root because the coefficients of the quadratic equation are integers.

Let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation by \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The quadratic equation with these roots can be written as:

\[
(x - (5 + \sqrt{3}))(x - (5 - \sqrt{3})) = 0
\]

Expanding this expression, we get:

\[
(x - 5 - \sqrt{3})(x - 5 + \sqrt{3}) = (x - 5)^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = (x - 5)^2 - 3
\]

Simplifying further, we have:

\[
(x - 5)^2 - 3 = x^2 - 10x + 25 - 3 = x^ 2 - 10x + 22
\]

Thus, the quadratic equation with integer coefficients for which \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is a root is:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 22 = 0
\]

This equation is of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) with integer coefficients \(a = 1\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 22\).

Therefore, the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is indeed a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5 + \sqrt{3} \text{ is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.}}

This solution is correct and provides a detailed step-by-step reasoning process to show that \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Let's start by analyzing the arguments of the inverse trigonometric functions.

Consider \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\). The angle \(\theta\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Now, let's consider \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). This means that \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\), or equivalently, \(\tan(\phi) = x\). The angle \(\phi\) is in the range \(0 < \phi < \pi\).

Notice that \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are such that \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\)  are complementary angles. Specifically, \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\). This is because \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute this into the original equation:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right).
\]

We know that \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\). However, the original equation states that this value is \(\frac{1}{3}\), which means there is no real value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation as stated.

and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

We observe that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, specifically, the second direction vector  is twice the first direction vector. Therefore, the lines are parallel.

To confirm, we can check if there is a point of intersection by setting the parametric equations equal to each other and solving for \(t\) and \(u\):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This gives us the system of equations:
\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u,
\]
\[
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u,
\]
\[
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u.
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \implies t = 2u - 4 .
\]

Substituting \(t = 2u - 4\) into the second equation:
\[
-10 - 9(2u - 4) = -3 - 18u \implies -10 - 18u + 36 = -3 - 18u \implies 26 = -3,
\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution for \(t\) and \(u\) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously, indicating that the lines do not intersect.

Since the lines are parallel and do not intersect, they are skew lines. However, the problem asks if the lines are parallel, and we have confirmed that they are parallel.

The answer is \(\boxed{\text{parallel}}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to identify the shape formed by the given points and determine its properties. The given points are \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\).

First, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane:
- The point \((5,4)\) is in the first quadrant.
- The point \((-5,4)\) is in the second quadrant.
- The point \((-5,-4)\) is in the third quadrant.
- The point \((5,-4)\) is in the fourth quadrant.

When we connect these points in order, we can see that they form a rectangle. Let's verify this:
- The distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
- The distance between \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).
- The distance between \((-5,-4)\) and \((5,-4)\) is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
- The distance between \((5,-4 )\) and \((5,4)\) is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

Since opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles, the shape is indeed a rectangle.

Next, we need to determine the area of this rectangle. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Here, the length is \(10\) (the distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\)) and the width is \(8\) (the distance between \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\)). Therefore, the area is:

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Also, the cross product is anti-commutative, meaning \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u})\). Using these properties, the expression simplifies to :

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{0} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\). Using the anti-commutative property, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\ ]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting these into the simplified expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplication and addition:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12  \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Adding these together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

Therefore, the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose 2 line segments out of 4:**
   The number of ways to choose 2 line segments out of 4 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

   Among these pairs, only the pairs (AB, CD) and (BC, DA) can form a quadrilateral. This is because the diagonals of a quadrilateral intersect inside the quadrilateral, and these are the only pairs that satisfy this condition.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The number of favorable outcomes is 2 (the pairs (AB, CD) and (BC, DA)). The total number of possible outcomes is 6. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that two randomly chosen line segments form a quadrilateral is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \). Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The radius of the larger circle (with diameter \( AC \)) is 2.
   - The radius of the smaller circle (with diameter \( AD \)) is 1.
   - The area of the region between the two circles is given by \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The area of a circle is given by the formula \( \pi r^2 \). For the larger circle with radius 2, the area is:
   \[
   \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   For the smaller circle with radius 1, the area is:
   \[
   \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the region between the two circles:**
   The area of the region between the two circles is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the  smaller circle:
   \[
   4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
   \]
   According to the problem, this area is also given by \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle:
   \[
   3\pi = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   This confirms the given information is consistent.

5. **Determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   Since \( AC \) is the diameter of the larger circle, \( \angle ADC \) is a right angle (90 degrees) because any angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.

Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is:

"To determine the number of apples in the basket after the process described, we need to follow the steps carefully.

1. **Initial number of apples**: The basket initially contains 8 apples.
2. **Apples added**: The process involves adding 3 more apples to the basket. So, we add these 3 apples to the initial 8 apples.
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Now, the basket contains 11 apples.
3. **Apples removed**: Next, we need to remove the apples that were taken out. The problem states that the apples taken out were from the basket and the number of apples taken out is equal to the number of apples added. Since 3 apples were added, 3 apples are removed.
   \[
   11 - 3 = 8
   \]
   After removing the 3 apples, the basket again contains 8 apples.

Therefore, the final number of apples in the basket is \(\boxed{8}\).```

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

Let \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]

We know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\ ), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5  = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product of these two expressions:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)  = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We use the difference of squares formula \((a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2\):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]

Therefore, the product is:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.09}.

" understand the problem. The problem provides some information about the age of a person and their relationship to their age when there was a certain number of years ago. We need to find the current age of the person.

Let's denote the current age of the person as \( x \).

According to the problem, 8 years ago, the person was 5 years older than 1/5 of their current age. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ x - 8 = 5 + \frac{1}{5}x \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 5:
\[ 5(x - 8) = 5 \cdot 5 + x \]
\[ 5x - 40 = 25 + x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 5x - x - 40 = 25 \]
\[ 4x - 40 = 25 \]

Then, we add 40 to both sides:
\[ 4x = 65 \]

Finally, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{65 }{4} \]
\[ x = 16.25 \]

So, the current age of the person is \(\boxed{16.25}\). 

This means the person is currently 16.25 years old, which is equivalent to 16 years and 3 months. 

To verify, we check the condition given in the problem. Eight years ago, the person was 8.25 years old. According to the problem, 8.25 should be equal to 5 plus 1/5 of the current age:
\[ 5 + \frac{1}{5} \times 16.25 = 5 + 3.25 = 8.25 \]

The condition is satisfied, confirming that the current age of the person is indeed \(\boxed{16.25}\).```
The final answer is $\boxed{16.25}$. This means the person is currently 16.25 years old, which is equivalent to 16 years and 3 months.

"To solve the expression \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

\[a = 513\]
\[b = 487\]

Next, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:

Now, we calculate the values inside the parentheses:

- Let \( y \) be the number of words in the second segment.
- Let \( z \) be the number of words in the third segment.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of words in the phrase is 120.
2. The number of words in the first and second segments combined is 24 more than the number of words in the third segment.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 120 \)
2. \( x + y = z + 24 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( x + y \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (z + 24) + z = 120 \]
\[ 2z + 24 = 120 \]
\[ 2z = 96 \]
\[ z = 48 \]

Now that we have \( z = 48 \), we can substitute this value back into the second equation to find \( x  + y \):
\[ x + y = 48 + 24 \]
\[ x + y = 72 \]

We also know from the first equation that:
\[ x + y + z = 120 \]
Since \( z = 48 \), we can substitute this value in:
\[ x + y + 48 = 120 \]
\[ x + y = 72 \]

This confirms our value for \( z \). Now, we need to find the number of words in the first and second segments combined. Since \( x + y = 72 \), the number of words in the first and second segments combined is 72. Therefore, the number of words in the third segment is 48.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \(x\).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation  \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64

Solving these two equations gives us:

Notice that \(\frac{16\pi}{15} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

首先，我们确定点的坐标。设 \(A = (0, h)\)，\(B = (-a, 0)\)，\(C = (a, 0)\)，且 \(M\) 是 \(BC\) 的中点，因此 \(M = (0, 0)\)。由于 \(AM = 11\)，我们有 \(h = 11\)。

现在，我们找到 \(D\) 的坐标。由于 \(D\) 是 \(AM\) 上的一点，且 \(AD = 10\)，我们有 \(D = (0, \frac{10}{11} \cdot 11) = (0, 10)\)。

接下来，我们需要找到 \(\angle BAC\)。设 \(\angle BAC = \theta\)。那么 \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\)。由于 \(D\) 在 \(AM\) 上，且 \(AM\)  垂直于 \(BC\)，我们可以使用三角形 \(ABD\) 和 \(ACD\) 中的正切函数。

在 \(\triangle ABD\) 中，\(\tan(\theta) = \frac{h}{a} = \frac{11}{a}\)。在 \(\triangle ACD\) 中，\(\tan(3\theta) = \frac{11 - 10}{a} = \frac{1}{a}\)。

使用三倍角的正切恒等式，\(\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}\)，我们代入 \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{11}{a}\)：

\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{11}{a} - \left(\frac{11}{a}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{11}{a}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{33}{a} - \frac{1331}{a^3}}{1  - \frac{363}{a^2}} = \frac{\frac{33a^2 - 1331}{a^3}}{\frac{a^2 - 363}{a^2}} = \frac{33a^2 - 1331}{a^3} \cdot \frac{a^2}{a^2 - 363} = \frac{33a^2 - 1331}{a^3 - 363a}
\]

我们知道 \(\tan(3\theta) = \frac{1}{a}\)，因此我们有：

\[
\frac{33a^2 - 1331}{a^3 - 363a} = \frac{1}{a}
\]

交叉相乘得到：

\[
33a^3 - 1331a = a^3 - 363a
\]

简化后，我们得到：

\[
32a^3 = 968a
\]

由于 \(a \neq 0\)，我们可以两边除以 \(a\)：

\[
32a^2 =  968
\]

解 \(a^2\)，我们得到：

\[
a^2 = \frac{968}{32} = 30.25

因此，\(a = \sqrt{30.25} = 5.5\)。

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx \):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know the second given equation:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) + 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
4 = s((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)) + 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 = s(s^2 - 3p) + 12,
\]
or:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This confirms our earlier equation.  Now, we need to find \(p\) using the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(x+y+z = s\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we can express the equation as:
\[
xy(s-x) + yz(s-y) + zx(s-z) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - (x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x) = 12.
\]
We know \(xy + yz + zx = p\), so:
\[
sp - (x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x) = 12.
\]
We also know that:
\[
x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp -  12.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
sp - (sp - 12) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = 12.
\]
This confirms our values. Now, we solve the equation:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Assume \(s = 2\), then:
\[
-8 = 2(4 - 3p),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = 8 - 6p,
\]
or:
\[
6p = 16,
\]
so:
\[
p = \frac{8}{3}.
\]
However, this does not satisfy the original equation. Instead, assume \(s = -2\), then:
\[
-8 = -2(4 - 3p),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = -8 + 6p,
\]
or:
\[
0 = 6p,
\]
so:
\[
p = 2.

"To determine the percentage increase in the percentage of students who passed the exam from the 9th to the 12th standard, we need to use the formula for percentage increase, which is:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the ""Old Value"" is the percentage of students who passed the exam in the 9th standard, and the ""New Value"" is the percentage of students who passed the exam in the 12th standard. From the table, we can see that the percentage of students who passed the exam in the 9th standard is 41.1%, and in the 12th standard is 11.6%.

First, we calculate the difference between the new value and the old value:

\[
11.6\% - 41.1\% = -29.5\%
\]

Next, we divide this difference by the old value:

\[
\frac{-29.5\%}{41.1\%} = -0.7183
\ ]

Finally, we multiply by 100 to convert this to a percentage:

\[
-0.7183 \times 100 = -71.83\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage increase in the percentage of students who passed the exam from the 9th to the 12th standard is:

\[
\boxed{-71.83}
\] 

However, since the question asks for the percentage increase, and we have a negative value, it indicates a decrease rather than an increase. The correct interpretation in the context of the question is that the percentage of students who passed the exam has decreased by 71.83%. But if we strictly follow the question's request for the percentage increase, we would box the negative value as is. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[

This indicates a decrease of 71.83 percentage points. However, if the question strictly asks for the percentage increase, we should note that it is a decrease and not an increase.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the absolute value \(|x^2 - 81|\) is:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
This means that the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative (i.e., \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\)) and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).

The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x-36)}  < 0.
\]
The expression will be negative when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive (since the numerator cannot be negative).

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). Therefore, we need to consider the intervals where \(0 < x < 36\) and \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\) (but since \(x \neq -9\) is already covered by the domain of the function).

So, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36 \text{ and } x \neq 9.
\]
In interval notation, this is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the shape and its properties:**
   The given shape is a rectangle with a semicircle on top and a semicircle on the bottom. The rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 2 units. The semicircles have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{3}{2} \) units.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ square units}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of one semicircle:**
   The area of a full circle with radius \( \frac{3}{2} \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of a full circle} = \pi \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \left( \frac{9}{4} \right)  = \frac{9\pi}{4} \text{ square units}
   \]
   Since we have a semicircle, we take half of the area of the full circle:
   \[
   \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{9\pi}{4} = \frac{9\pi}{8} \text{ square units}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the two semicircles:**
   Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:
   \[
   \text{Total area of the semicircles} = 2 \times \frac{9\pi}{8} = \frac{18\pi}{8} = \frac{9\pi}{4} \text{ square units}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total area of the shape:**
   The total area of the shape is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the total area of the two semicircles:
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 6 + \frac{9\pi}{4}
   \]

6. **Simplify the expression :**
   The total area is already in its simplest form:
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 6 + \frac{9\pi}{4}
   \]

Therefore, the area of the shape is \(\boxed{6 + \frac{9\pi}{4}}\). However, since the problem specifies that the answer should be in the form of a numerical value, we need to recognize that the problem might be asking for the numerical value of the area. The numerical value of \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14, so:
\[
\frac{9\pi}{4} \approx \frac{9 \times 3.14}{4} = \frac{28.26}{4} = 7.065
\]
Thus, the total area is approximately:
\[
6 + 7.065 = 13.065
\]
However, the problem asks for the exact value, so the answer is:
\[

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle S\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

Using the property of complementary angles, we know that:
\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R}
\]

We need to find \(\cos{R}\). Recall the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine:
\[
\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

Simplify the square of the sine value:
 \[
\frac{4}{25} + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

To isolate \(\cos^2{R}\), subtract \(\frac{4}{25}\) from both sides:
\[
\cos^2{R} = 1 - \frac{4}{25}
\]

Convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
1 = \frac{25}{25}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{25}{25} - \frac{4}{25} = \frac{21}{25}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
\cos{R} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.

   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) (which is not in the domain \( x >  3 \)) or the solutions to \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0.
   \]
   This gives \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \) (which is not in the domain \( x > 3 \)). Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \) other than \( x = 3 \), which is already considered.

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \):
1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3  \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   We need to check if there are any solutions for \( x > 3 \). Testing values greater than 3, we see that the function \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \) is a cubic polynomial that decreases rapidly for \( x > 3 \). Since \( f(3) = 0 \) and the function is decreasing for \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions for \( f(x) = 6 \) in the domain \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these together, we get:

"To determine the number of days it takes for the two trains to meet, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let the speed of the first train be \( v_1 \) and the speed of the second train be \( v_2 \). The distance between the two cities is 3500 km. The first train starts from city A and the second train starts from city B, so they are moving towards each other. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their individual speeds, i.e., \( v_1 + v_2 \).

The time taken for the two trains to meet is the total distance divided by their relative speed. Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the two trains to meet. The distance traveled by the first train in time \( t \) is \( v_1 t \) and the distance traveled by the second train in time \( t \) is \( v_2 t \). Since the sum of the distances traveled by both trains is equal to the total distance between the two cities, we have:

\[ v_1 t + v_2 t = 3500 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ ( v_1 + v_2) t = 3500 \]

We know that the speed of the first train is 200 kg/x and the speed of the second train is 150 kg/x. However, since the problem is about the distance and time, we should consider the speeds in terms of km/h. Assuming the speeds are given in km/h, we can substitute \( v_1 = 200 \) km/h and \( v_2 = 150 \) km/h into the equation:

\[ (200 + 150) t = 3500 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 350 t = 3500 \]

"To solve for \( g(x) \) and then find \( g(2) \), we first need to understand the transformation applied to \( f(x) \) to get \( g(x) \). The function \( g(x) \) is defined as \( f(x-1) \), which means \( g(x) \) is the function \( f(x) \) shifted to the right by 1 unit.

The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Therefore, the function \( g(x) \) is:

"ity of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) is \( 2 \).

2. **Determine the slope of the perpendicular line:**
   The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to \( y = 2x - 2 \) is:
   \[
   m_{\perp} = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

3. **Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the perpendicular line:**
   The point-slope form of a line equation is given by:
   \[
   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
   \]
   where \( (x_1, y_1) \) is a point on the line and \( m \) is the slope. Substituting the point \( (6, 0) \) and the slope \( -\frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{2}x  + 3
   \]

4. **Find the x-intercept of the perpendicular line:**
   The x-intercept occurs where \( y = 0 \). Set \( y = 0 \) in the equation \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \):
   \[
   0 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the x-intercept is \( (6, 0) \).

5. **Find the y-intercept of the perpendicular line:**
   The y-intercept occurs where \( x = 0 \). Set \( x = 0 \) in the equation \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \):
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{2}(0) + 3
   \]
   \[
   y = 3
   \]
   Therefore, the y-intercept is \( (0, 3) \).

So, the equation of the line  perpendicular to \( y = 2x - 2 \) and passing through the point \( (6, 0) \) is:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3

The coordinates of the points where this line intersects the coordinate axes are \( (6, 0) \) and \( (0, 3) \).

"Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
 \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the value of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

 From Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of all possible products of the roots taken two at a time is zero:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

To find the individual values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\), we use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials. Let's assume:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.
\]
By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\), we  get:
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]

From \(a + c = 2\), we can express \(c\) as \(c = 2 - a\). Substituting \(c = 2 - a\) into \(ac + b + d = 0\), we get:
\[
a(2 - a) + b + d = 0 \implies 2a - a^2 + b + d = 0 \implies b + d = a^2 - 2a.
\]
We also have \(bd = 2\). Let's solve these equations. From \(b + d = a^2 - 2a\) and \(bd = 2\), we can consider \(b\) and \(d\) as the roots of the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - (a^2 - 2a)t + 2 = 0.
\]
The roots of this quadratic equation are:
\[
t = \frac{a^2 - 2a \pm \sqrt{(a^ 2 - 2a)^2 - 8}}{2}.
\]
To find specific values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), we can test possible values. Let's try \(a = 1\):
\[
c = 2 - 1 = 1,
\]
\[
b + d = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 = -1,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]
The roots of \(t^2 + t + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
t = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-7}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{7}}{2}.
\]
So, \(b\) and \(d\) are \(\frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2}\) and \(\frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2}\). This gives us the factorization:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the quarters and the number of dimes and nickels given the total values of the coins.

Let's denote:
- \( q \) as the number of quarters,
- \( d \) as the number of dimes,
- \( n \) as the number of nickels.

The value of the quarters is \( 0.25q \) dollars, the value of the dimes is \( 0.10d \) dollars, and the value of the nickels is \( 0.05n \) dollars. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total value of the quarters and dimes is \$1.24.
2. The total value of the quarters and nickels is \$1.82.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

\[ 0.25q + 0.10d = 1.24 \]
\[ 0.25q + 0.05n = 1.82 \]

First, let's eliminate \( q \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[ (0.25q +  0.05n) - (0.25q + 0.10d) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 0.05n - 0.10d = 0.58 \]
\[ 5n - 10d = 58 \]
\[ n - 2d = 11.6 \]

Since \( n \) and \( d \) must be integers, we realize there was an error in the previous step. Let's correct it by solving the equations correctly:

From the first equation:
\[ 0.25q + 0.10d = 1.24 \]
Multiplying through by 100:
\[ 25q + 10d = 124 \]
\[ 5q + 2d = 24.8 \] (This step was incorrect, let's use the correct integer approach)

From the second equation:
\[ 0.25q + 0.05n = 1.82 \]
Multiplying through by 100:
\[ 25q + 5n = 182 \]
 \[ 5q + n = 36.4 \] (This step was incorrect, let's use the correct integer approach)

We need to find integer solutions for \( q, d, n \). Let's test possible values for \( q \):

If \( q = 4 \):
\[ 5(4) + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 20 + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 2d = 4 \]
\[ d = 2 \]

Now substitute \( q = 4 \) and \( d = 2 \) into the second equation to find \( n \):
\[ 5(4) + n = 36.4 \]
\[ 20 + n = 36.4 \]
\[ n = 16.4 \] (This is not an integer, so let's try another value for \( q \))

If \( q = 5 \):
\[ 5(5) + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 25 + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 2d = -1 \] (This is not possible, so let's try another value for \( q \))

 If \( q = 3 \):
\[ 5(3) + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 15 + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 2d = 9 \] (This is not an integer, so let's try another value for \( q \))

If \( q = 2 \):
\[ 5(2) + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 10 + 2d = 24 \]
\[ 2d = 14 \]
\[ d = 7 \]

Now substitute \( q = 2 \) and \( d = 7 \) into the second equation to find \( n \):
\[ 5(2) + n = 36.4 \]
\[ 10 + n = 36.4 \]
\[ n = 26.4 \] (This is not an integer, so let's try another value for \( q \))

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by performing the division step-by-step.

Let's do the division:

- 500 goes into 1370 (we add a zero to 137 to make the division possible) 2 times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)). So, we write down 2 and subtract 1000 from 1370, which leaves us with 370.
- Now, we bring down another 0 to make it 3700. 500 goes into 3700 7 times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)). So, we write down 7 and subtract 3500 from 3 700, which leaves us with 200.
- Next, we bring down another 0 to make it 2000. 500 goes into 2000 4 times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)). So, we write down 4 and subtract 2000 from 2000, which leaves us with 0.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"Given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as its center and \(AB/AD = k\), we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \(P\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((-a, a)\), \(B\) at \((a, a)\), \(C\) at \((a, -a)\), and \(D\) at \((-a, -a)\). Here, \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2a/\sqrt{k}\).

The condition that a point \(P = (x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices can be written as the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) being less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. This gives us the following inequalities:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
\[
\ sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay \implies 0 < a(2x + 2a - 2y)
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2  \implies 0 < -2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay \implies 0 < a(-2x + 2a - 2y)
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + 2a^2 + 2ay \implies 0 < a(2x + 2a + 2y)
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2ay + a^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + 2a^2 + 2ay \implies 0 < a(-2x + 2a + 2y)
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
0 < 2x + 2a - 2y  \implies x + a > y
\]
\[
0 < -2x + 2a - 2y \implies -x + a > y

\[

"To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at specific values and then sum the results. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6  \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the cube root of 8 squared, which is \( 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money earned from selling the items and then calculate the average price per item.

First, let's list the prices of the items:
- L vulnerable Rs. 27.47
- S P P P P P P P P P P P P Rs. 35.23
- J P P P P P P P P P P P P Rs. 37.37
- E P P P P P P P P P P P P Rs. 26.52

Next, we calculate the total amount of money earned by summing these prices:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

The total amount of money earned  is Rs. 126.59.

Now, we need to find the average price per item. There are 6 items, so we divide the total amount by 6:
\[
\frac{126.59}{6} = 21.098333\ldots
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average price per item is Rs. 21.10.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{21.10}
\]```


The final answer is $\boxed{21.10}$. This is the average price per item. The total amount earned is Rs. 126.59, and dividing this by the number of items (6) gives us the average price.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals and the number of fish in each scenario. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the pattern:**
   - When there are 2 animals, there are 8 fish.
   - When there are 4 animals, there are 16 fish.
   - When there are 6 animals, there are 24 fish.
   - When there are 8 animals, there are 32 fish.

2. **Determine the relationship:**
   - We can see that the number of fish is always 4 times the number of animals. This is because:
     - \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
     - \(4 \times 4 = 16\)
     - \(6 \times 4 = 24\)
     - \(8 \times 4 = 32\)

3. **Apply the pattern to the unknown scenario:**
   - We need to find the number of fish when there are 10 animals.
   - Using the pattern, the number of fish is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   -  Therefore, when there are 10 animals, there are 40 fish.

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\).```.linspace

"To solve for \( n \) in the given problem, we need to analyze the provided diagram and use the relationships between the segments. The diagram consists of a grid with several segments labeled with expressions involving \( n \).

First, let's identify the segments and their relationships:
- The top row from left to right contains the segments \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \).
- The second row from left to right contains the segments \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \).
- The third row from left to right contains the segments \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \).

The problem states that the sum of the segments in each row is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

### Step 1: Sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1)
\]
Simplifying this expression:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
Thus, the sum \( S \ ) is:
\[
S = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1
\]
Simplifying this expression:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Thus, the sum \( S \) is:
\[
S = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Equate the sums of the rows
Since the sums of the segments in each row are equal, we set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)
To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
1 = n - 6
\]
Add 6  to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

To verify, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the expressions for the sums and check if they are equal:
- First row: \( 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
- Second row: \( 3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)

Both sums are indeed equal to 15, confirming our solution. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\). \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)  \)","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"给定方程 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，我们知道 \(\omega\) 是一个原初的三次单位根。这意味着 \(\omega\) 和 \(\omega^2\) 是方程 \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) 的根。因此，我们知道：
\[
\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0
\]
我们需要找到 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值。

首先，我们为两个分数找到一个共同的分母：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]
利用 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) 的事实，我们可以简化分子：
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1
\]
 接下来，我们简化分母：
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1
\]
因此，表达式简化为：
\[

因此，\(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值是 \(\boxed{1}\)。

"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) using the given lengths of the sides and the coordinates of the points. We will use Heron's formula, which requires the lengths of all three sides of the triangle.

First, let's identify the lengths of the sides of \( \triangle ABC \):
- \( AB = 6 \)
- \( BC = 5 \)
- \( CA = 6 \)

Next, we calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{6 + 5 + 6}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
\]

Now, we apply Heron's formula to find the area \( K \) of the triangle:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \( a = 6 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
K = \sqrt{8.5 \left(8.5 - 6\right) \left(8.5 - 5 \right) \left(8.5 - 6\right)}
\]
\[
K = \sqrt{8.5 \times 2.5 \times 3.5 \times 2.5}
\]

Calculate the product inside the square root:
\[
8.5 \times 2.5 = 21.25
\]
\[
3.5 \times 2.5 = 8.75
\]
\[
21.25 \times 8.75 = 185.9375
\]

Now, take the square root of the result:
\[
K = \sqrt{185.9375} \approx 13.63
\]

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is approximately:
\[
\boxed{13.63}
