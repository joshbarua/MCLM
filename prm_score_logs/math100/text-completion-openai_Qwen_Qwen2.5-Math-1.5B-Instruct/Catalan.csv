"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\sin D = 0.7\), we start by identifying the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(D\).

In the right triangle \(DEF\), angle \(D\) is opposite side \(EF\) and adjacent to side \(DF\). The hypotenuse is \(DE\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we know that:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Since \(EF = 7\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = \frac{7}{\frac{7}{10}} = 7 \times \frac{10}{7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the value of \( w \) after rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) (45 degrees) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   - \( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)
   - \( c = 2 - 3i \)

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   - Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
     \[
     z - c = \left( (2 + \sqrt{2}) - 2 \right) + \left( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) + 3 \right)i = \sqrt{2} - (3\sqrt{2})i
     \]
     So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \ ).

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   - A counterclockwise rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
     \[
     (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
     \]
     Distribute the terms:
     \[
     = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
     Simplify each term:
      \[
     = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
     \]
     So, after rotation, we have \( w - c = 4 - 2i \).

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   - Add \( c \) to \( w - c \):
     \[
     w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
     \]

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is \( \boxed{6 - 5i} \).```

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
     \[
     242 \div 2 = 121
     \]
     Therefore, \(242 = 2 \times 121\).

2. **Factor 121:**
   - Next, we factor 121. We check if it is divisible by any prime numbers.
   - 121 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd).
   - Sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3.
   - 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: \(121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857\) (not an integer).
   - Check divisibility by 11: \(121 \div 11 = 11\)
      Therefore, \(121 = 11 \times 11\).

3. **Combine the factors:**
   - Now we have the complete prime factorization of 242:
     \[
     242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
     \]

4. **Simplify the square root:**
   - We write the square root of 242 using its prime factors:
     \[
     \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}
     \]
   - We can take the square root of the perfect square \(11 \times 11\):
     \[
     \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11
     \]
   - Therefore:

"To determine in how many ways 8 people can be arranged around a table with the condition that three specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of three as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a table is given by \((n-1)!\). So, for 6 units, the number of arrangements is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the three people within their block**: Within the block, the three people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) can be arranged among themselves in \(3! = 6\) ways.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the table by the number of ways to arrange the three people within their block. This gives us \( 120 \times 6 = 720\).

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).```　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that does not contain \(x\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the sum, we get:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\ ]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k} x^{-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set the exponent of \(x\) equal to zero and solve for \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
 \]

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = -\frac{1000}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).```

"To determine the smallest angle of rotation that will return a regular pentagon to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When we rotate a regular pentagon, it will look the same after every rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (5 in this case).

The angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is given by:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that after rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees, it will look exactly the same as it did before. rotated by 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, or 360 degrees will also return the pentagon to its original position, but the smallest of these angles is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the smallest angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is:

"To solve for the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). We will consider the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

First, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2}  \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Since our initial solution for \(x\) is 6, we need to consider the other diagonal \(AD\) and \(BC\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AD\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint  of } AD = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(BC\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2 } = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the sum \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at those points. So, we need to solve the equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

Setting each factor to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7 \]
\[ x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2 \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote 
To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to determine the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

\[

Next, find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[

 \[
\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = 16, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = 1

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, recall that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

Now, we use the fact that the sum of all the fifth roots of unity is zero.  The fifth roots of unity are \( 1, z, z^2, z^3, z^4 \), and their sum is:
\[ 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. \]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting the secant function in terms of cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x }
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trees are equal in weight to six squigs. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's establish the relationship between the weight of a tree and a squig. According to the problem, two trees and one goolee are equal in weight to three squigs. We can write this relationship as:

\[ 2T + G = 3S \]

where \( T \) is the weight of a tree, \( G \) is the weight of a goolee, and \( S \) is the weight of a squig.

The problem also tells us that a tree and a goolee are equal in weight to a squig. We can write this relationship as:

\[ T + G = S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( 2T + G = 3S \)
2. \( T + G = S \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):

\[ G = S - T \]

Now substitute \( G = S - T \) into the first equation:

\[ 2T + (S - T) = 3S \]
\[  2T + S - T = 3S \]
\[ T + S = 3S \]
\[ T = 2S \]

Now we know that the weight of a tree is twice the weight of a squig. So, if we want to find out how many trees are equal in weight to six squigs, we can use the relationship \( T = 2S \):

\[ 6S = 3T \]

Since \( T = 2S \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( 2S \):

\[ 6S = 3(2S) \]
\[ 6S = 6S \]

This confirms our relationship. Therefore, six squigs are equal in weight to three trees. So the answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]```

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2)  = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (ab - 10)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).  Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and doesn't give us new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(ab - 10 = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 2:

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) with equations 3 and 4:

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For equation 4:

\[
(-3)(2) - 10 = -6 - 10 = -16 
\]

Both equations are satisfied. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

"To solve for the radius of the cylindrical dip circle, we need to use the information given about its volume and the rate at which it is being filled.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylindrical dip circle by \( r \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the height \( h \) is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, and the volume is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
Since the volume of the cylinder is \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we can differentiate both sides with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]
We know that \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour, so substituting this into the equation gives:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \ ]
We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]
Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]
Thus, the radius of the cylindrical dip circle is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \] meters.```

The final answer is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\).```

This solution uses the given information about the rate of volume increase and the rate of height increase to set up a relationship between the radius and the rates. Differentiation is used to find the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, and then the radius is solved for by isolating it in the equation. The final answer is expressed in the form of a square root, which is the simplest radical form. The problem is designed to test the student's understanding of related rates in calculus, specifically the application of the chain rule to find the rate of change of the volume of a cylinder.

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to ensure that the function \(f(x)\) is strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's check the derivatives of the two pieces of the function:
- For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\), so \(f'(x) = 2ax\).
- For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\), so \(f'(x) = a\).

For \(f(x)\) to be strictly monotonic, \(f'(x)\) must be either always positive or always negative. Since \(2ax\) can be positive or negative depending on the value of \(x\) and \(a\), and \(a\) is a constant,  we need to ensure that the function does not change direction. This means that \(a\) must be positive because if \(a\) were negative, the function would not be strictly monotonic (it would have a maximum or minimum).

Now, let's check the continuity of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a \]
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \]
For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3 \]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0 \]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the solutions:
\[ a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 - a - 2 = 0 \]
The quadratic equation \(a^2 - a - 2 = 0\) can be factored as :
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \]
So the solutions are:
\[ a = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad a = -1 \]
Since \(a\) must be positive, we discard \(a = -1\) and \(a = 0\). Therefore, the only positive solution is \(a = 2\).

To verify, if \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
The derivative is:
\[ f'(x) =
\begin{cases}
4x & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
Both derivatives are positive, so the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once.

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle described by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \) (which is -10), square it, and add and subtract this value inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Now for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \) (which is 6), square it, and add and subtract this  value inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the left side, we have:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to isolate the completed squares on one side, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).```

"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x,
\]
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0,
\]
\[
x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0\). Solving the second equation for \(x\), we get:
\[
\lambda - \lambda x = 1,
\]
\[
\lambda(1 - x) = 1,
\]
\[
x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\ ]
For \(x\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This implies:
\[
0 \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1,
\]
\[
\lambda \geq 1.
\]
So, for \(\lambda \geq 1\), there are two fixed points: \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). We start by computing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x .
\]
This equation can be simplified to:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x,
\]
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0,
\]
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). We already know that \(x = 0\) is a solution. For non-zero \(x\), we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We know that \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point for \(\lambda \geq 1\), so we need to check if there are other solutions. For \(\lambda = 1\), the function \(f (x) = x(1 - x)\) has fixed points at \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). For \(\lambda > 1\), we need to check if there are other solutions in the interval \([0,1]\) that are not fixed points.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the quadratic equation, we find that for \(\lambda > 1\), there are additional solutions to \(f(f(x)) = x\) that are not fixed points. Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) are:

First, let's rewrite the numerator and the denominator using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formula for cosine, \(\cos(a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \ sin b\), to combine the terms. Notice that:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator is:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formula for sine, \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\), to combine the terms. Notice  that:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to simplify further. Notice that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin  85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Since \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\), we can see that the expression simplifies to \(\tan 40^\circ\).

Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) is:

   f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
   \]

2. **Set the partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:**

   \[
   f_x = \sqrt{1  - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
   \]

   \[
   f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0
   \]

   From \( f_x = 0 \):

   \[
   \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
   \]

   Squaring both sides:

   \[
   (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
   \]

   \[
   1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
   \]

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 1
   \]

   From \( f_y = 0 \):

   \[
   \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
   \]

    Squaring both sides:

   \[
   (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
   \]

   \[
   1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
   \]

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 1
   \]

   Therefore, the critical points occur on the boundary of the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

3. **Evaluate \( f \) at the critical points on the boundary:**

   On the boundary \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as:

   \[
   x = \cos \theta, \quad y = \sin \theta
   \]

   Substituting into \( f \):

   \[
   f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt {1 - \cos^2 \theta}
   \]

   Simplifying using \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \):

   \[
   f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
   \]

4. **Evaluate \( f \) at the boundary points:**

   At the boundary points \( (1, 0) \), \( (-1, 0) \), \( (0, 1) \), and \( (0, -1) \):

   \[
   f(1, 0) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1
   \]

   \[
   f(-1, 0) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1
   \]

    \[
   f(0, 1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1
   \]

   \[
   f(0, -1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the domain \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) is \( 1 \).

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we need to use the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3
\end{vmatrix}
 = \mathbf{i} \left(a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1\right)
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k } (-2 + 6)
= \mathbf{i} (8) - \mathbf{j} (10) + \mathbf{k} (4)
= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
= \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}
= \sqrt{180}
= 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\|
= \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5}
= 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \).

First, we express \( z \) in terms of \( \phi \). The quadratic equation whose roots are \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) is:
\[ t^2 - \phi t + 1 = 0. \]
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[ t = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{ 2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5 - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}. \]
However, we don't need to find the exact values of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) to solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Instead, we use the properties of the golden ratio and the recurrence relations of the powers of \( z \).

We know that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) satisfy the recurrence relation:
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \phi (z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}}) - (z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}}). \]
Let \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{ z^n} \). Then the recurrence relation becomes:
\[ a_n = \phi a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}. \]
We know the initial conditions:
\[ a_0 = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2, \]
\[ a_1 = z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]
Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the first few terms:
\[ a_2 = \phi a_1 - a_0 = \phi^2 - 2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 8}{4} = \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ a_3 = \phi a_2 - a_1 = \phi \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \phi = \frac{\phi(-1  + \sqrt{5}) - 2\phi}{2} = \frac{\phi(-1 + \sqrt{5} - 2)}{2} = \frac{\phi(-3 + \sqrt{5})}{2} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-3 + \sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5} - 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ a_4 = \phi a_3 - a_2 = \phi \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{\phi(1 - \sqrt{5}) + 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5}) + 2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - 5 + 2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4}  = \frac{-2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ a_5 = \phi a_4 - a_3 = \phi \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{\phi(-1 - \sqrt{5}) - 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-1 - \sqrt{5}) + 2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-1 - 5 + 2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-4 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-2 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ a_6 = \phi a_5 - a_4 = \phi \left(\frac{-2 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{\phi(-2 - \sqrt{5}) + 1 The final answer is :

"To solve the problem, we need to use some properties of triangles and centroids. Let's start by understanding the geometric configuration and then use area relationships.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that if \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) are the medians, then \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Line through the centroid parallel to a side:**
   The line through the centroid \( G \) that is parallel to side \( BC \) will intersect sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) at points \( M \) and \( N \) respectively. This line creates similar triangles with the original triangle \( ABC \).

3. **Area relationships:**
   Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangle \( AMN \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \). The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the vertex to the parallel line. Since  \( G \) divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \( AGN \):**
   The line \( MN \) splits triangle \( ABC \) into two regions: triangle \( AMN \) and trapezoid \( MNCB \). The area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \), so the area of the trapezoid \( MNCB \) is \( 1 - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

   Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangle \( AGN \) is similar to triangle \( AGB \) with the same ratio of similarity as the height ratio, which  is \( \frac{1}{3} \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGN \) is \( \frac{1}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

5. **Find the area of triangle \( AGN \):**
   Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AGN \) is \( \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16 \).

Thus, the area of triangle \( AGN \) is \(\boxed{16}\).```

"To find the eighth term of an arithmetic sequence given the fourth and eighth terms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given terms:**
   - The fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200.
   - The eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500.

2. **Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:**
   The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

   where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.

3. **Set up equations for the fourth and eighth terms:**
   - For the fourth term (\(a_4\)):
     \[
     a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200

   - For the eighth term (\(a_8\)):

   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[

   Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   d = \frac{300}{4} = 75

5. **Substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find \(a_1\):**
   \[

   \[
   a_1 + 3(75) = 200

First, let's simplify the denominator:
\[2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 4 \cdot 78125 = 312500.\]
So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{21}{312500}.\]

Next, we perform the division \(21 \div 312500\). This can be done by long division or by using a calculator. When we divide 21 by 312500, we get:

First, let's express \( 2^{24} \) in a general form that shows it as a perfect \( n \)-th power. If \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, then there exists an integer \( k \) such that:

\[ 2^{24} = k^n \]

This implies that \( k \) must be a power of 2. Let's write \( k \) as \( 2^a \) for some integer \( a \). Then we have:

\[ 2^{24} = (2^a)^n = 2^{an} \]

By comparing the exponents of 2 on both sides of the equation, we get:

- If \( n = 2 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \), so \( k = 2^{12} = 4096 \).
- If \( n = 3 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \), so \( k = 2^8 = 256 \).
- If \( n = 4 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \), so \( k = 2^6 = 64  \).
- If \( n = 6 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \), so \( k = 2^4 = 16 \).
- If \( n = 8 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \), so \( k = 2^3 = 8 \).
- If \( n = 12 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{12} = 2 \), so \( k = 2^2 = 4 \).
- If \( n = 24 \), then \( a = \frac{24}{24} = 1 \), so \( k = 2^1 = 2 \).

In all cases, \( k \) is an integer, so \( 2^{24} \) is indeed a perfect \( n \)-th power for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of n floats and dimes that make up a total value of 75 c coins. Let's denote the number of n floats as \( n \) and the number of dimes as \( d \).

We know the following:
1. The value of one n float is 25 c.
2. The value of one dime is 10 c.
3. The total value of all the coins is 75 c.

This gives us the equation:
\[ 25n + 10d = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 5n + 2d = 15 \]

Now, we need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( n \) and \( d \). Let's test possible values for \( n \):

If \( n = 0 \):
\[ 5(0) + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 2d = 15 \]
\[ d = 7.5 \] (not an integer)

If \( n = 1 \):
\[ 5(1) + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 5 +  2d = 15 \]
\[ 2d = 10 \]
\[ d = 5 \] (an integer)

If \( n = 2 \):
\[ 5(2) + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 10 + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 2d = 5 \]
\[ d = 2.5 \] (not an integer)

If \( n = 3 \):
\[ 5(3) + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 2d = 0 \]
\[ d = 0 \] (an integer)

If \( n = 4 \):
\[ 5(4) + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 20 + 2d = 15 \]
\[ 2d = -5 \] (not possible since \( d \) must be a non-negative integer)

For \( n \geq 4 \), the value of \( 5n \) will be greater than 15, so there are no more solutions.

Therefore, the possible solutions are \( (n, d ) = (1, 5) \) and \( (n, d) = (3, 0) \). Since the problem asks for the number of n floats, we can state the answer as:

\[
\boxed{3}
\] (since the problem does not specify which solution to choose, we can choose either, but typically in such problems, the non-zero solution is preferred unless specified otherwise). However, if we strictly follow the problem's requirement to find the number of n floats, we can say the number of n floats is 3. 

So, the number of n floats is \boxed{3}. \\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}\\\end{system}\\\end{user}\\\end{assistant}","[3, '3']",7,"[7, '7']",False

"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \( (a, b) \) that lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. Solve for \( y \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we isolate \( 2b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Now, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram step by step.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the dotze quadrats. The diagram shows that the rectangle is 3 units wide and 4 units tall. Therefore, the total area of the rectangle is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the unshaded regions. There are two unshaded regions: a smaller rectangle at the top and a triangle at the bottom.

1. **Area of the smaller rectangle at the top:**
   The smaller rectangle has a width of 2 units and a height of 4 units. Therefore, its area is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ square units}
   \]

2. **Area of the triangle at the bottom:**
   The triangle is a right triangle with a base of 1 unit and a height of 2 units. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height }
   \]
   Substituting the given values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 = 1 \text{ square unit}
   \]

Now, we can find the total area of the unshaded regions by adding the areas of the smaller rectangle and the triangle:
\[
8 + 1 = 9 \text{ square units}
\]

Finally, to find the area of the shaded region, we subtract the area of the unshaded regions from the total area of the rectangle:
\[
12 - 9 = 3 \text{ square units}
\]

Thus, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number that is a multiple of 450 and consists of the digits 0 and 1 only. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the structure of the number:**
   The number must be a multiple of 450. Since 450 = 2 × 3^2 × 5^2, the number must end in 00, 50, or 0 (but since it can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00). Additionally, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9 (because 5^2 = 25, and 25 times any integer is a multiple of 25, but we only need to check the sum of the digits for divisibility by 9).

2. **Construct the number:**
   The number must be of the form 111...11100, where the number of 1's is a multiple of 9 (to ensure the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9). The smallest such number is 11111111100.

3 . **Verify the number:**
   - The number 11111111100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 100.
   - The sum of the digits of 11111111100 is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9, which is a multiple of 9.

   - The second number is obtained by dividing by 5 and must be one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the possible second numbers are:

3.  **Identify the specific combination that is correct:**
   - The problem states that there is only one specific combination that is correct. Therefore, there is only 1 successful outcome.

4. **Calculate the probability:**

"To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator:

\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]

So, the fraction can be rewritten as:

\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This can be done by moving the decimal point in 4321 to the left 7 places and then dividing by 2:

\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.021605000.\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is 0.021605000. Now , we sum the digits of this decimal number:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20 ^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
 \[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
To find the value of \((\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ)\), we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Thus, \((\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)( \sin^2 80^\circ) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

The equation \( z = c \) tells us that the height \( z \) is constant and equal to \( c \). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

Since \( g(x) \) is a cubic polynomial, we need to find the coefficients of \( g(x) \) and then use the formula for the sum of the roots. However,  we can also use a property of polynomial transformations. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

First, recall that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). So the expression becomes:

We know from trigonometric identities that \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\). However, these identities might not directly simplify our expression, so let's consider another approach using the fact that the angles are related by a factor of 2.

We can use the identity \(\sin 2x = 2 \sin  x \cos x\) and \(\cos 2x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x\). But instead, we will use a known result for this specific combination of angles. It is known that:

Given that the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \), we can express the sum of all the interior angles as:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + \text{one interior angle}
\]

The interior angle of a polygon can range from just above \( 0^\circ \) to just below \( 180^\circ \). However, for a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \( 180^\circ \). Let's denote the missing interior angle by \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be between \( 0^\circ \) and \( 180^\circ \). This means:

\[
180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

 Solving for \( n \):

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.9444
\]
\[
n < 8.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \( n \) is 8. Now, we check if \( n = 8 \) works by calculating the sum of the interior angles of an 8-sided polygon:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080
\]

If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing angle is:

\[
1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ
\]

Since \( 10^\circ \) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, \( n = 8 \) is indeed the correct number of sides. Therefore, the polygon has:

\[
\boxed{8}
\] sides.","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve for \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to understand the concept of modular inverses. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Given that \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we can write:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \),  \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( k \) such that:

\[ k^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( k \) to find such a solution. By testing, we find that:

\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

 \[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since both solutions \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) satisfy the original condition \( 0 < t < 23 \), we can choose either one. However, typically the smallest positive solution is preferred, so the answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]```

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\) is \(a - b\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

So, we have:

Calculating the squares, we get:

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we need to find \( f(5) \):

\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
\]

Next, we subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):

\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at 6. The function \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we need to find \( g(6) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, for any non-zero real number \(x\), we have:

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

This identity holds because \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) when \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We know that \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), so the equation becomes:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{3}

This is a contradiction, which means there are no real values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.  Therefore, the solution set is empty.

"To determine if the two lines are parallel and to find the distance between them, we need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the direction vectors of the lines are scalar multiples of each other.
2. If they are parallel, find the distance between the lines.

The parametric equations of the lines are:
\[ \text{Line 1: } \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ \text{Line 2: } \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \]

First, we check if the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vectors are:
\[ \mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \]

 We see that:
\[ \mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1} \]
So, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, meaning the lines are parallel.

Since the lines are parallel, the distance between them is the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) from Line 1 and find the distance to Line 2.

The formula for the distance \(D\) from a point \(\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}\) to a line \(\mathbf{Q} + u \mathbf{d}\) is:
\[ D = \frac{\| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} \]
where \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a point on the line, \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the line, and \(\mathbf{PQ}\) is the vector from  \(\mathbf{Q}\) to \(\mathbf{P}\).

Here, \(\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{Q} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find \(\mathbf{PQ}\):
\[ \mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-5) \\ -10 - (-3) \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}\):
\[ \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7  & -5 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-4) - (-5)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-4) - (-5)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-18) - (-7)(4)) \]
\[ = \mathbf{i}(28 - 90) - \mathbf{j}(-32 + 20) + \mathbf{k}(-144 + 28) \]
\[ = \mathbf{i}(-62) - \mathbf{j}(-12) + \mathbf{k}(-116) \]
\[ = \begin{pmatrix} -62 \\ 12 \\ -116 \end{pmatrix} \]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}\) is:
\[ \| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{(-62)^2 + 12^2 + (-116)^2} = \sqrt{3844  + 144 + 13456} = \sqrt{17444} = 2\sqrt{4361} \]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\) is:
\[ \| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 324 + 16} = \sqrt{356} = 2\sqrt{89} \]

The distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = \frac{\| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{2\sqrt{4361}}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \]

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangular region with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the range of \(x\)-coordinates and \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle:**
   - The \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\), but not including \(-5\) and \(5\) because the points must lie strictly inside the rectangle.
   - The \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\), but not including \(-4\) and \(4\) because the points must lie strictly inside the rectangle.

2. **Count the integer \(x\)-coordinates:**
   - The integer \(x\)-coordinates between \(-5\) and \(5\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
   - There are \(9\) integer \(x\)-coordinates.

   - There are \(7\) integer \(y\)-coordinates.

4. **Calculate the total number of points inside the rectangle:**

   - Therefore, the total number of points is \(9 \times 7 = 63\).

First, let's expand the expression \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \ (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
Next, we substitute the given cross products \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\ ):
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and the vector additions/subtractions:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ -14 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding these vectors together:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ -14 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 + 12 - 12 \\ -42 - 14 - 21 \\ 108 + 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -77 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), and \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of \( \overline{AD} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) as \( a \) and \( b \) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid as \( h \). Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{CD} \) is the height of the trapezoid, so \( CD = h \).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h =  42.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84. \tag{1}
\]

Next, consider the triangle \( \triangle ACD \). Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the angle bisector theorem in \(\triangle ABD\). However, we can also use the fact that the height of \(\triangle ACD\) is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is \( h \). The base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(AD = a\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

We need to find the value of \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \). From equation (1), we know that \( (a + b) \times h = 84 \). Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{CD} \) is the height  of the trapezoid, and we can express \( h \) in terms of the area of the trapezoid. However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the area of the trapezoid.

Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height \( h \) is the same for both \(\triangle ACD\) and the part of the trapezoid that includes \( \overline{CD} \). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle BCD\).

Given that the total area of the trapezoid is 42, and since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\boxed{21}.

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fractions:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
    \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to use the operation defined by L'operació, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

We need to find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators and the fractions:

\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \quad \text{(simplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3)}
\]

Now, we multiply these results together:

 \[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{7}{10} = 7 \cdot 7 = 49
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside a circle, we can proceed with the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) chosen randomly on the circumference of the circle. We need to find the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside the circle.

2. **Geometric Insight**: Two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside the circle if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged in such a way that one pair of points is separated by the other pair when moving around the circle. In other words, if we label the points in the order they appear on the circle as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), the chords will intersect.

3. **Counting the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\). This is because we can fix one point and arrange the remaining 3 points in 3! ways,  but since the circle can be rotated, we consider the arrangements up to rotation, which reduces the count to 6.

4. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 possible arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting. These are the arrangements \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Any other arrangement will result in the chords being separate or not intersecting at all.

5. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside the circle is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).```

"To solve for the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties.

1. **Identify the radii and areas:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle (circular segment) is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The total area of the annular ring (the area between the two circles) is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**

3. **Calculate the area of the annular ring:**
   \[

   \[
   \text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times (1)^2 = \pi

5. **Calculate the area of the annular ring using the areas of the circles:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the annular ring} = \text{Area of the larger circle} - \text{Area of the smaller circle} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi

6. **Set up the equation for the annular ring area:**

   \]

7. **Solve for the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The area of the annular ring can also be expressed in terms of the angle \(\angle ADC\). The area of the annular ring can be found by subtracting the area of the sector of the smaller circle from the area of the sector of the larger circle.

   Let \(\theta\) be the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times (1)^2 = \frac{\theta}{2}

   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times (2)^2 = 2\theta

   The area of the annular ring is:

"To solve the given expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's denote:
\[ \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \]
\[ \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \]

This means:
\[ \sin \alpha = 0.4 \]
\[ \sin \beta = 0.5 \]

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

We also need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have :
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now we can substitute these values into the sine formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = 0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21} \]
\[ \sin (\beta -  \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = 0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3} \]

Now we need to find the product:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21}\right) \left(0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) \]

This is a difference of squares:
\[ \left(0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21}\right) \left(0.1\sqrt{21} - 0.2\sqrt{3}\right) = (0.1\sqrt{21})^2 - (0.2\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.01 \cdot 21 - 0.04 \ cdot 3 = 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09 \]

Thus, the value of the given expression is:
\[ \boxed{0.09} \]```

- No s'pueden formar un subcomit del 5 From the problem, we need to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party. Let's break this problem down into manageable steps.

Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 8公共ans and 6 demics.
The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8公共ans + 6 demics) is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one member is from each party.
To find this, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 5 members that include only 公共ans or only demics from the total number of ways to choose 5 members.

The number of ways to choose 5 members from 8公共ans is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 demics is:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
\]

Step 3: Subtract the invalid combinations from the total combinations.
The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is:

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies this equation. We can start by testing some integer values for \( n \).

Let's try \( n = 5 \):
\[
(5-1) \cdot 5 \cdot (5+1) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This works, so the three consecutive integers are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).

Now, we need to check the second condition given in the problem. The product of the three integers divided by their average should equal 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
For \( n = 5 \ ), the average is 5. Now, let's check the division:
\[
\frac{4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24

This condition is also satisfied.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \), and the largest of these integers is:

To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the expression inside the cube root in a simpler form.**
   The expression \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be written as a perfect square:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we will use properties of the cosine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15 } \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, for \(n = 15\), we have the identity:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]
This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but it is a known result for this specific set of angles.

Therefore, we have:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by noting that \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\). Let \(AB = AC = x\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), it follows that \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

Given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the relationship between the angles and the sides of the triangle. Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\), so \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

First, we use the fact that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = y\). Then, by the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
x^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + y^2 = 121 + y^2
\]
Thus,
\[
y^2 = x^2 - 121 \implies y = \sqrt{x^2 - 121}
\ ]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
Since \(BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 100}\) and \(CD = \sqrt{AC^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 100}\), we have:
\[
(2y)^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 - 100})^2 + (\sqrt{x^2 - 100})^2 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 - 100} \cdot \sqrt{x^2 - 100} \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
4y^2 = 2(x^2 - 100) - 2(x^2 - 100) \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
4(x^2  - 121) = 2(x^2 - 100) - 2(x^2 - 100) \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
4x^2 - 484 = 2x^2 - 200 - 2x^2 \cos(3\theta) + 200 \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
2x^2 - 284 = -2x^2 \cos(3\theta) + 200 \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
2x^2 - 284 = \cos(3\theta)(-2x^2 + 200)
\]
\[
\cos(3\theta) = \frac{2x^2 - 284}{-2x^2 + 200} = \frac{142 - x^2}{x^2 - 100}
\]

Using the triple angle formula for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we need to find \(\ cos(\theta)\). From the right triangle \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 121}}{x}
\]
Substituting \(\cos(\theta)\) into the triple angle formula, we get:
\[
\cos(3\theta) = 4\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 121}}{x}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 121}}{x}\right) = \frac{4(x^2 - 121)^{3/2} - 3x(x^2 - 121)^{1/2}}{x^3}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\cos(3\theta)\), we have:
\[
\frac{142 - x^2}{x^2 - 100} = \frac{4(x^2 - 121)^{3/2} - 3x(x^2 - 121)^{1/2}}{x^3}
\]

 Solving this equation, we find that \(x = 13\). Therefore, \(AB = AC = 13\) and \(BC = 2y = 2\sqrt{13^2 - 121} = 2\sqrt{144} = 24\).

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 13 + 13 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\boxed{50}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of the product of 27 and \(3^7\).

First, let's express 27 as a power of 3:
\[ 27 = 3^3 \]

Now, we need to find the product of \(3^3\) and \(3^7\). Using the properties of exponents, specifically the rule that states \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can simplify the expression:
\[ 3^3 \cdot 3^7 = 3^{3+7} = 3^{10} \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of \(3^{10}\):
\[ 3^{10} = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \]

We can break this down step by step:
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 3^4 = 9 \times 9 = 81 \]
\[ 3^8 = 81 \times 81 = 6561 \]
 \[ 3^{10} = 3^8 \times 3^2 = 6561 \times 9 \]

Now, let's multiply 6561 by 9:
\[ 6561 \times 9 = 59049 \]

Therefore, the value of \(3^{10}\) is 59049. So, the value of the product of 27 and \(3^7\) is:

"A first step is to analyze the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \). We can break this into two separate inequalities:

1. \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)
2. \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

Since \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are both non-negative for all real \( x \), the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is always true because the left side is always greater than or equal to 0, which is greater than -4. Therefore, the first inequality does not impose any restrictions on \( x \).

Now, we focus on the second inequality:

\[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

To solve this, we can complete the square. Observe that:

\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 \]

So the inequality becomes:

\[ (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21 \]
\[ (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25  \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ -5 < x^2 + 2 < 5 \]

Subtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we obtain:

\[ -7 < x^2 < 3 \]

Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we can simplify this to:

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) is:

"Given the equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also have:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) = sp.
\]
Since \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \), we have:
\[
sp = 12.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 12.
\]
From \(sp = 12\), we can express \(s\) as:
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]
Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \left( \left( \frac{12}{p} \right)^2 - 3p \right).
\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \left( \frac{144}{p^2} - 3p \right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3}.
\]
Multiplying  both sides by \(p^3\):
\[
-8p^3 = 1728 - 36p^3.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
28p^3 = 1728,

\[
p^3 = 64,

\[
p = 4.

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

   - homes that earned the aires: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
   - dones that earned the aires: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
   - The ratio of homes to dones is \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.05\)
   - The percentage increase is \(\left(\frac{123 - 118}{118}\right) \times 100 \approx 4.23\%\ )
   - This does not match 135%.

2. **Class 10^夹**:

   - dones that earned the aires: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
   - The ratio of homes to dones is \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.04\)
   - The percentage increase is \(\left(\frac{103 - 99}{99}\right) \times 100 \approx 4.04\%\)
   - This does not match 135%.

3. **Class 11^夹**:
   - homes that earned the aires: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
   - dones that earned the aires: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
    - The ratio of homes to dones is \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.51\)
   - The percentage increase is \(\left(\frac{62 - 41}{41}\right) \times 100 \approx 52.44\%\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are the points where the expression is undefined.

Next, let's consider the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Thus, the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|\).

Now, we need to determine when the fraction \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative. The absolute value \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is always non-negative, so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x - 36 )\) is negative. This is because a non-negative number divided by a negative number is negative.

The expression \(x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36 (excluding 0 and 36). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the camp, we start by defining the dimensions and variables given in the problem. The camp is rectangular with a semicircular extension on each of its longer sides. The total length of the camp (including the semicircles) is 400 meters. Let's denote the width of the rectangular part of the camp by \( w \) and the length of the rectangular part by \( l \). The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The total length of the camp includes the two lengths of the rectangular part plus the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) \), so the total length of the camp is:
\[
l + l + \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) + \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = 2l + \pi w = 400
\]
From this equation, we can express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}
\]

The area \( A \ ) of the camp consists of the area of the rectangular part plus the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangular part is \( l \times w \), and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{8} \pi w^2 \). Therefore, the total area is:
\[
A = l w + 2 \left( \frac{1}{8} \pi w^2 \right) = l w + \frac{1}{4} \pi w^2
\]
Substituting \( l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \right) w + \frac{1}{4} \pi w^2 = \frac{400w - \pi w^2}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi w^2 = \frac{400w}{2} - \frac{\pi w^2}{2} + \frac {\pi w^2}{4} = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{4}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} = 0
\]
Solving for \( w \), we get:
\[
200 = \frac{\pi w}{2} \implies w = \frac{400}{\pi}
\]
Substituting \( w = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \), we get:
\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 400}{2} = 0
\]
This result indicates that the maximum area is when the width \( w \) is \( \frac{400}{\pi} \) and the length \( l \) is 0, which is not practical. Instead,  we should consider the critical point where the derivative is zero, and the maximum area is:
\[
A = 200 \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right) - \frac{\pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)^2}{4} = \frac{80000}{\pi} - \frac{40000}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi}

"Given the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\). We need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Since \(\angle R\) is one of the non-right angles, \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite to } R}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}\). This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\), then by the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the remaining side \(RS\) can be found as follows:

\[
RS = \sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]

Now, since \(\ angle T\) is the other non-right angle, \(\sin T\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to \(\angle T\) (which is \(RS\)) to the hypotenuse (which is \(RT\)). Therefore,

\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the parabola \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we need to minimize the distance function \(D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance function, we get:

\[D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}.\]

Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} .\]

To minimize \(D\), we can minimize \(D^2\), which is a simpler function:

\[D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}.\]

Let \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero:

\[f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0.\]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = \pm\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[f(0) = \frac{9}{2},\]
\[f(\sqrt{2}) = f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{ 9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), so the minimum value of \(D\) is \(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\). Therefore, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\), and \(a + b = 12\).

The answer is \(\boxed{12}\).```\\

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the piecewise function \( f(x) \).

### Case 1: \( f(x) = 0 \)

#### Subcase 1.1: \( x \leq 3 \)
Here, \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

#### Subcase 1.2: \( x > 3 \)
Here, \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0. \]
Factoring out \( x \), we get :
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) or equivalently \( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[ (x-3)(x+1) = 0. \]
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this subcase.

From the above, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Case 2: \( f(x) = 6 \)

#### Subcase 2.1: \( x \leq 3 \)
Here, \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.  \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

#### Subcase 2.2: \( x > 3 \)
Here, \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6. \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
Testing possible rational roots, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). By using numerical methods or graphing, we find that there is no real root in the domain \( x > 3 \).

From the above, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Final Calculation
Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the distances from point \( P \) to each of the vertices of the octahedron, we need to use the given distances and the properties of the octahedron. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be placed in three-dimensional space as follows:
\[ (1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, -1). \]

We are given that the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. Let's denote the coordinates of point \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

The distance from \( P \) to a vertex \( (a, b, c) \) is given by the formula:
\[ \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2}. \]

We can write the equations for the distances from \( P  \) to the vertices \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) as:
\[ \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3, \]
\[ \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7, \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8, \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9, \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11. \]

We can square each of these equations to eliminate the square roots:
\[ (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, \]
\[ (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49, \]
\[ x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64, \]
\[ x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81,  \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121. \]

Next, we expand and simplify these equations:
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, \]
\[ x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121. \]

Rewriting these equations, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x + 1 = 9, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 1 = 49, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y + 1 = 64, \]
\[ x^2 + y ^2 + z^2 + 2y + 1 = 81, \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121. \]

Let \( k = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). Then we can rewrite the equations as:
\[ k - 2x + 1 = 9, \]
\[ k + 2x + 1 = 49, \]
\[ k - 2y + 1 = 64, \]
\[ k + 2y + 1 = 81, \]
\[ k - 2z + 1 = 121. \]

Solving for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) in terms of \( k \), we get:
\[ k - 2x + 1 = 9 \implies k - 2x = 8 \implies x = \frac{k - 8}{2}, \]
\[ k + 2x + 1 = 49 \implies k + 2x = 48 \implies x = \frac{48 - k}{2 }, \]
\[ k - 2y + 1 = 64 \implies k - 2y = 63 \implies y = \frac{k - 63}{2}, \]
\[ k + 2y + 1 = 81 \implies k + 2y = 80 \implies y = \frac{80 - k}{2}, \]
\[ k - 2z + 1 = 121 \implies k - 2z = 120 \implies z = \frac{k - 120}{2}. \]

Since \( x \) and \( y \) must satisfy both equations for \( x \) and \( y \), we equate the expressions for \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ \frac{k - 8}{2} = \frac{48 - k}{2} \implies k - 8 = 48 - k \implies 2k = 56 \implies k = 28. \]

Now we can find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \):
\[ x = \frac{28 - 8}{2 The final answer is :
\[ k - 2y + 1 = 64 \implies k - 2y = 63 \implies y = \frac{k - 63}{2}, \]
\[ k + 2y + 1 = 81 \implies k + 2y = 80 \implies y = \frac{80 - k}{2}, \]

The distances from point \( P \) to the vertices are \(\boxed{3, 7, 8, 9, 11}\).","[{3, 7, 8, 9, 11}, '3, 7, 8, 9, 11']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To solve the problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force ( force ) applied to an object is equal to the mass ( mass ) of the object multiplied by its acceleration ( acceleration ). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Given:
- The mass of the soft ball is \( m_s = 200 \) g.
- The mass of the baseball is \( m_b = 150 \) g.
- The force applied to both balls is the same, which is the force that Jack applies to the baseball.

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can write:

\[ F = m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]

where \( a_s \) is the acceleration of the soft ball and \( a_b \) is the acceleration of the baseball. We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \).

From the equation \( m_s \cdot a_s =  m_b \cdot a_b \), we can solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \]

Substituting the given masses:

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the acceleration of the soft ball is \( \frac{3}{4} \) times the acceleration of the baseball. The ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]```

So the least significant digit (rightmost) is 6.

Next, we divide 89 by 7:
\[89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5\]
So the next digit is 5.

Next, we divide 12 by 7:

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the coefficients of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]
The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( f(x) \) is obtained by evaluating \( f(1) \). Therefore, we calculate:
\[ f(1) = 3(1)^4 + 5(1)^2 - 9(1) - 2 = 3 + 5 - 9 - 2 = -3. \]
This means the sum of the coefficients of \( f(x) \) is \(-3\).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is the same as the value of \( g(1) \). By the definition of \( g(x) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \ ]
Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"Per a finding the shortest distance from a point to a line, we use the point-to-line distance formula. The formula for the distance \( d \) from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( Ax + By + C = 0 \) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) in the standard form \( Ax + By + C = 0 \). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \( A = 2 \), \( B = -1 \), and \( C = -2 \).

The point given is \( (6, 0) \). So, \( x_1 = 6 \) and \( y_1 = 0 \).

Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\ ]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is:

\[
|10| = 10
\]

Next, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \( \sqrt{5} \):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

First, let's denote the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these sums by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively:
\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\ ]

We know that:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0,
\]
\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]
Now, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the roots:
\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 +  \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4),
\]
\[
4 = (-2)^2 - 2 \cdot 0,
\]
\[
4 = 4.
\]
This identity is consistent. Now, let's consider the polynomial whose roots are the sums \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). The sum of these roots is:
\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
We can rewrite this sum using the identity  for the product of the roots:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

"To determine the cost of one llogaritx, we start by defining the variables. Let \( l \) be the cost of one llogaritx in dollars and \( g \) be the cost of one gume in dollars. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. The cost of three llogaritats and one gume is $1.24:
\[ 3l + g = 1.24 \]

2. The cost of five llogaritats and one gume is $1.82:
\[ 5l + g = 1.82 \]

We can solve these equations using the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):

\[ (5l + g) - (3l + g) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 5l + g - 3l - g = 0.58 \]
\[ 2l = 0.58 \]
\[ l = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ l = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of one llogar itx is $0.29. To find the cost of one llogaritx in cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.29 \times 100 = 29 \]

Therefore, the cost of one llogaritx is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.```

"To determine the last digit of the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) that is different from zero, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into its decimal form.
2. Identify the last digit of the decimal expansion that is not zero.

First, let's convert \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal. We can do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). Now, we need to identify the last digit of this decimal expansion that is not zero. The decimal \(0.274\) has three digits after the decimal point: 2, 7, and 4. All of these digits are not zero. Therefore, the last digit in this decimal expansion is 4.

Thus, the last digit of the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) that is different from zero  is \(\boxed{4}\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices of the rectangle.

First, let's consider the geometry of the situation. The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of both the length and the width. If we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, a)\), \(B = (a, a)\), \(C = (a, -a)\), and \(D = (-a, -a)\), then the center \(O\) is at \((0, 0)\).

A point \(P\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is simply the Euclidean distance \(OP\). The distance from \(P\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, a)\), is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}\).

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \( A\), we need:
\[
OP < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2
\]
\[
0 < 2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay
\]
\[
0 < 2a(x - y + a)
\]
\[
0 < x - y + a
\]
This inequality must be true for all four vertices. Therefore, we need:
\[
x - y + a > 0, \quad x - y - a > 0, \quad x + y + a > 0, \quad x + y - a > 0
\]
These inequalities describe a region inside the rectangle. The intersection of these regions is a smaller square with side length \(a\sqrt{2}\) centered at the origin. The area of this smaller square  is \((a\sqrt{2})^2 = 2a^2\).

The area of the original rectangle is \(4a^2\). Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{2a^2}{4a^2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```

"To determine the congruence of 54 modulo 6, we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. This can be done through the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We perform the division:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

This division is exact, meaning the quotient \(q\) is 9 and the remainder \(r\) is 0. Therefore, we can write:

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]

The remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. By definition, this tells us that 54 is congruent to 0 modulo 6. In mathematical notation, we write:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate each term separately.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.04719 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.04719 \rceil = 2 \).

 2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n  \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many cents are in a dollar and how many dollars are in a cent, we start by understanding the basic conversion: 1 dollar = 100 cents. We need to convert the total amount of money that Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie earned into cents and then find out how many dollars and cents that total amount is.

First, we calculate the total amount of money earned by adding the individual earnings:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]
We can add these step-by-step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]
So, the total amount of money earned is $126.59. To convert this amount into cents, we multiply by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \ text{ cents}
\]
Now, we need to determine how many dollars and cents this is. Since 100 cents make up a dollar, we divide 12659 by 100:
\[
12659 \div 100 = 126 \text{ dollars and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money in dollars and cents is 126 dollars and 59 cents. The number of cents in the total amount is 59.

The final answer is \(\boxed{59}\). This means that when Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie convert their total earnings into bitllets, they need to quxab 59 cents.

Let's start by calculating the total scores for each grade.

1. ** Scores of 80:**
   - Number of students: 20
   - Total score: \( 20 \times 80 = 1600 \)

2. **scores of 90:**
   - Number of students: 8
   - Total score: \( 8 \times 90 = 720 \)

3. **scores of 100:**
   - Number of students: 2
   - Total score: \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)

Next, we sum these total scores to find the overall total score.

\[

Now, we determine the total number of students who participated in the exam.

\[

Finally, to find the average (arithmetic mean), we divide the total score by the number of students.

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
2 & n & n-1 \\
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum \( S \) of the first row:
\[
S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's find the sum \( S \) of the second row:
\[
S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Since both expressions represent the same sum \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
2n +  1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \\
7 = n

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[

To verify, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

"To determine how many feet longer Martha walked compared to Jim, we need to calculate the distance each person walked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim walked. Jim walked along the diagonal of the rectangular camp. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. For the camp, the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. So, we have:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = 500  \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim walked 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha walked. Martha walked the length of the camp, which is 400 feet, and then the width of the camp, which is 300 feet. So, the total distance Martha walked is:

\[ \text{ Martha's distance} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance Martha walked and the distance Jim walked:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 = 1\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term in the sum:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we  can express \(\omega^2\) as \(-1 - \omega\). Therefore, we have:
\[
1 + \omega^2 = 1 + (-1 - \omega) = -\omega.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can express \(1 + \omega\) as \(-\omega^2\). Therefore, we have:
\[
1 + \omega = -\omega^2.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2}.
\]

Now, we can substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\ ]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\left(\frac{1}{\omega^2} + \frac{1}{\omega}\right) = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{\omega^3}\right) = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{1}\right) = -(\omega + \omega^2).
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore:
\[
-(\omega + \omega^2) = -(-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\). Since this is the only possible value, we do not need to consider separate cases. The final answer is simply \(\boxed{1}\). \\\end{assistant}\\\]```\(1\)```\\end{assistant}\\\]```\(","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True

The points are arranged in a specific geometric shape, and the distances between them are given.

Let's list the distances again for clarity:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)
- \(AC = 6\)

We will use the fact that the points form a quadrilateral with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). The shortest path will be the one that uses the shortest diagonals and sides.

3. ** route \(A \to C \to B \to D \to A \)**:
   \[
   AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 6 + 3 + 5 = 20

4. ** route \(A \to C \to D \to B \to A \)**:

From the calculations above, the shortest distance is 18, which can be achieved by either the route \(A \ to B \to D \to C \to A\) or the route \(A \to C \to D \to B \to A\).
