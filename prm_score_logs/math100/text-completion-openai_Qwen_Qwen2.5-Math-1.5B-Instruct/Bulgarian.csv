"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(D\):
   - \(EF\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\).
   - \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

2. Recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF}
   \]
   Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the sine equation:
   \[
   0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
   \]

3. Solve for \(DF\):
   \[
   DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

4. Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\), which is the adjacent side to angle \(D\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose:
   \[
    DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   100 = DE^2 + 49
   \]
   Solve for \(DE^2\):
   \[
   DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
   \]
   Take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).```

"To find the complex number \( w \), we need to rotate the point \( z \) around the point \( c \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) (45 degrees) in the counterclockwise direction. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate the translated point \( z - c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi  \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so \( e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Expanding the product:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2 }
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate the result back by adding \( c \):**
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).```python
from sympy import I, exp, pi, sqrt

# Define the complex numbers z and c
z = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3*sqrt(2))*I
c = 2 - 3*I

# Translate z so that c is at the origin
translated_z = z - c

# Rotate the translated point by pi/4
rotated_z = translated_z * exp(I*pi/4)

# Translate the result back by adding c
w = rotated_z + c

# Simplify the expression for w
w_simplified = w.simplify()
print(w_simplified)

"1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - On a round table, there are 8 guests.
   - 3 of these guests are named П intuit, Рfact, mixed.
   - All the other guests sit together.

2. **Determine the number of groups**:
   - We have 3 guests (П Int, Рfact, mixed) who are sitting together.
   - The remaining guests sit together, so we treat them as one group.
   - Therefore, there are 2 groups in total: one group of 3 guests and one group of the remaining 5 guests.

3. **Arrange the groups around the table**:
   - The number of ways to arrange \( n \) groups around a circular table is \((n-1)!\).
   - Here, \( n = 2 \), so the number of ways to arrange 2 groups is \((2-1)! = 1!\).

4. **Calculate the arrangements:
   \[
   1! = 1
   \]

5. **Arrange the guests within each group**:
   - The group of 3 guests (П Int, Рfact, mixed) can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - The group  of 5 guests can be arranged in \(5!\) ways.
   
6. **Calculate the internal arrangements**:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]
   \[
   5! = 120

7. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**:
   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups by the number of ways to arrange the guests within each group.
   \[
   1 \times 3! \times 5! = 1 \times 6 \times 120 = 720

"1. **目录**
   - The task is to expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\).

2. **Use the Binomial Theorem**
   - The Binomial Theorem states that:
     \[
     (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
     \]
   - For our expression, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

3. **Calculate the General Term**
   - The general term in the expansion is given by:
     \[
     T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
     \]

4. **Simplify the General Term**
   - Simplify each part of the general term:
     \[
     T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k } \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
     \]
   - Combine the powers of \(x\):
     \[
     T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k) - 2k}
     \]
   - Simplify the exponents of \(x\):
     \[
     T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
     \]

5. **Determine the Valid Terms for \(k\)** 
   - Since we are expanding \((10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2})^5\), \(k\) can range from 0 to 5.
   - We need to find the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero:
     \[
     15 - 5k = 0
     \]
   - Solve for \(k\):
     \[
     15 = 5k \implies  k = 3
     \]

6. **Find the Coefficient for \(k = 3\)**
   - Substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:
     \[
     T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
     \]
   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
     \]
     \[
     10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
     \]
     \[
     \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Multiply these together:
     \[
     T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

   - The coefficient of \(x^0\) (the constant term) is \(-125\).

\[
\boxed{-125}
\] 

This concludes the solution to the problem of expanding the binomial expression and finding the constant term. The final answer is \(-125\). 

The solution uses the Binomial Theorem to expand the binomial \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) and determine the coefficient for the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

"给定 \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)，我们需要 show that the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7.

首先，将 \( n \) 用其模 7 的等价数表示：
\[ n = 7k + 2 \]
对于某个整数 \( k \).

接下来，将 \( n = 7k + 2 \) 代入表达式 \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\)：
\[ n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4 \]
\[ n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6 \]
\[ n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8 \]

现在，我们需要检查这些项模 7：
\[ n + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod {7} \]

因此，表达式 \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) 模 7 变为：
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]
\[ 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 24 \cdot 1 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

然而，我们需要检查整个乘积的可除性。我们已经知道：
\[ n + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

因此，乘积是：
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

这意味着 \( n + 2 \)，\( n + 4  \)，和 \( n + 6 \) 中的一个项不能被 7 整除，从而 \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) 不能被 7 整除。

因此，我们需要重新审视我们的初始条件。由于 \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)，我们有：
\[ n + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

因此，乘积是：
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

因此，\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) 不可被 7 整除。因此，正确的答案是：

"1. **Define the variables and the target expression:**
   Let \( a, b, c, d \) be the speeds of the four players in km/h.
   The expression we need to minimize is:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b+c+d} + \frac{b}{a+c+d} + \frac{c}{a+b+d} + \frac{d}{a+b+c}
   \]

2. **Introduce the constraint:**
   Since the players take turns to run, their combined speeds must be at least 4 km/h (as each player runs at least 1 km/h).
   \[
   a + b + c + d \geq 4
   \]

3. **Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:**
   By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:
   \[
   \left( \frac{a}{b+c+d} + \frac{b}{a+c+d} + \frac{c}{a+b+d} + \frac{d}{a+b+c} \right) \left( a(b+c+d) + b(a+c+d) + c(a+b+d) + d(a+b+c) \right ) \geq (a+b+c+d)^2
   \]

4. **Simplify the second term:**
   Notice that:
   \[
   a(b+c+d) + b(a+c+d) + c(a+b+d) + d(a+b+c) = 3(a+b+c+d)
   \]

5. **Substitute and simplify:**
   Substitute this back into the inequality:
   \[
   \left( \frac{a}{b+c+d} + \frac{b}{a+c+d} + \frac{c}{a+b+d} + \frac{d}{a+b+c} \right) \cdot 3(a+b+c+d) \geq (a+b+c+d)^2
   \]

6. **Divide both sides by \(3(a+b+c+d)\):**
   \[
   \frac{a}{b+c+d} + \frac{b}{a+c+d} + \frac{c}{a+b+d} + \frac{d}{a+b+c} \geq \frac{(a+b+c+d)^2}{3(a+b+c+d)}
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{(a+b+c +d)^2}{3(a+b+c+d)} = \frac{a+b+c+d}{3}
   \]

7. **Use the constraint \(a + b + c + d \geq 4\):**
   Since \(a + b + c + d \geq 4\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{a+b+c+d}{3} \geq \frac{4}{3}
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is:
   \[
   \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}

This completes the proof. The minimum value of \(\frac{a}{b+c+d} + \frac{b}{a+c+d} + \frac{c}{a+b+d} + \frac{d}{a+b+c}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}\). Each player must run at least 1 km/h for this minimum value to be achieved. This means each player's speed must be equal to ensure the minimum value is obtained.

    - We are given four points: \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\).
    - By the problem's condition, \( x > 7 \).

2. **Determine the equation of the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\)**:
    - The slope \( m \) of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is calculated as follows:
    \[
    m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
    \]
    - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \((5, 3)\):
    \[
    y - 3 = 5(x - 5)
    \]
    - Simplifying the equation:
    \[
    y - 3 = 5x - 25 \ implies y = 5x - 22
    \]

3. **Comparing with the given point \((7, 4)\)**:
    - Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the line equation \( y = 5x - 22 \):
    \[
    y = 5(7) - 22 = 35 - 22 = 13
    \]
    - Thus, the point \((7, 4)\) does not lie on the line \( y = 5x - 22 \).

4. **Determining the line passing through the points \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\)**:
    - The slope \( m \) of the line passing through \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is calculated as follows:
    \[
    m = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = \frac{-4}{1} = -4
    \]
    - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \((6, 8 )\):
    \[
    y - 8 = -4(x - 6)
    \]
    - Simplifying the equation:
    \[
    y - 8 = -4x + 24 \ implies y = -4x + 32
    \]

5. **Comparing with the given point \((5, 3)\)**:
    - Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the line equation \( y = -4x + 32 \):
    \[
    y = -4(5) + 32 = -20 + 32 = 12
    \]
    - Thus, the point \((5, 3)\) does not lie on the line \( y = -4x + 32 \).

6. **Determining the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\)**:
    - The slope \( m \) of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\) is calculated as follows:
    \[
    m = \frac{4 - 3}{7 - 5} = \frac{1}{2 }
    \]
    - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \((5, 3)\):
    \[
    y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 5)
    \]
    - Simplifying the equation:
    \[
    y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2} \ implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
    \]

7. **Comparing with the given point \((6, 8)\)**:
    - Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the line equation \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[
    y = \frac{1}{2}(6) + \frac{1}{2} = 3 + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5
    \]
    - Thus, the point \((6, 8)\) does not lie on the line \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}  \).

8. **Finding the minimum value of \( x + y \)**:
    - To find the minimum value of \( x + y \), we use the inequalities and conditions derived:
    \[
    x + y > 5 + 3 = 8
    \]

9. **Conclusion**:
    - Therefore, the minimum value of \( x + y \) is 11.
    \[
    \boxed{11}
    \] 

    Here, we have used the properties of inequalities and the line passing through given points to conclude that \( x + y \) has a minimum value of 11.

Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{11} \).

"1. **Determine the roots of the denominator:**

   The function given is:
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}
   \]
   To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to solve the equation where the denominator is zero:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]
   We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-14)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square root:
   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}
   \]
   \[
    x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

2. **Determine the horizontal asymptote:**

   To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \). We compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:
   - The degree of the numerator is 1.
   - The degree of the denominator is 2.

   Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**

   From the previous steps, we have:
   - \( a = 7 \)
   - \( b = -2 \)
   - \( c = 0 \)

    Therefore, the sum \( a + b + c \) is:

"To find the smallest possible value of \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^* A \), where \( A^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( A \).

First, we compute \( A^* A \):
\[ A^* = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \]
\[ A^* A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^* A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^* A \) is given by:
\[ \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16. \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}. \]
So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^* A \) is 16, and thus the largest singular value of \( A \) is  \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4, and the smallest value of \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is \( C = 4 \).

Hence, the answer is:

This is equivalent to finding the operator norm of \( A \), which is the maximum of the eigenvalues of \( A^* A \). The operator norm of \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), and the smallest value of \( C \) is the operator norm of \( A \). The operator norm of \( A \) is found to be 4.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \), \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \), and so on.  Thus, the expression can be rewritten as:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Therefore, the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10:**
   \[

3. **Convert the result back to base 9:**

   - To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to find the coefficients of the powers of 9 that sum up to 36.
   -  The largest power of 9 less than or equal to 36 is \(9^1 = 9\).

   - Determine the coefficient for \(9^1\):
     \[
     36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{(quotient is 4, remainder is 0)}

     So, the coefficient for \(9^1\) is 4.

   - Since the remainder is 0, the coefficient for \(9^0\) is 0.

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
 \]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\). Therefore, \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling out \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.
\]

The final answer is:
\[

This is the final answer. The expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) simplifies to \(\cot x\). The final answer is \(\boxed{\cot x}\).```

"Let's define the values of the geometric shapes as follows:
- Let the value of a cube be \( C \).
- Let the value of a sphere be \( S \).
- Let the value of a cylinder be \( H \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The value of three cylinders is equal to the value of three cubes and one sphere. This can be written as:
\[ 3H = 3C + S \]
2. The value of two cylinders and one sphere is equal to the value of one cube. This can be written as:
\[ 2H + S = C \]

We need to find the value of the volume of one cylinder compared to the volume of one cube. To do this, we will solve the system of equations for \( H \) and \( S \) in terms of \( C \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( S \):
\[ S = C - 2H \]

Now substitute this expression for \( S \) into the first equation:
\[ 3H = 3C + (C - 2H) \]
\[ 3H = 3C + C - 2H \]
\[ 3H +  2H = 4C \]
\[ 5H = 4C \]
\[ H = \frac{4C}{5} \]

So, the value of one cylinder is \(\frac{4C}{5}\). Therefore, the volume of one cylinder is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the volume of one cube.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2 ) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify our values of \(a\) and \(b\) in equations 2 and 3:

For equation 2:

\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

For equation 3:

 \[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

Both equations are satisfied, so our values are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

   - Substituting the volume formulas:
     \[

     \]
   - Substituting the surface area formulas:

"Д per linear function \(y = f(x)\) on the graph of the piecewise function

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{idel-to } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{ default-to } x < a,
\end{cases}
\]

can be found by ensuring that the function is continuous at \(x = a\). For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), the value of the function from the left side of \(a\) must be equal to the value of the function from the right side of \(a\). This means that we need to have:

\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x). \]

From the left side (\(x < a\)), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). So,

\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

From the right side (\(x \geq a\)), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\).  So,

\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:

\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\), we get:

\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

This gives us three solutions:

\[ a = 0, \quad a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2, \quad a = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = -1. \]

Since \(a\) is a number, we need to check the conditions of the function. The function \(f(x)\) is defined for all real numbers \(x\) if \(a > 0\). Therefore, the only valid solution is \(a = 2\).

The given equation is:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0. \]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25. \]

For the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
 we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9. \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0. \]
Combine the constants:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0. \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed square terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c. \]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right-hand side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1. \]
Solving for \( c \):

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for some \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda (1 - x) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda (1 - x) = 1 \implies x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The value \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f\) if it lies in the interval \([0,1]\). This means:
\[
 0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies 0 \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda \geq 1.
\]
So, for \(\lambda \geq 1\), \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point. For \(\lambda < 1\), there are no fixed points in \((0,1)\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there is a point \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). This means that \(f\) should not be an involution (a function that is its own inverse) except for the fixed points. Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
 \]
We want \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be simplified to:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\).

For the second case, we need to check when \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution in \((0,1)\). Let's analyze the behavior of the function \(g(x) = \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)\):
- When \(x = 0\), \(g(0) =  \lambda^2\).
- When \(x = 1\), \(g(1) = 0\).
- The maximum value of \(g(x)\) in \([0,1]\) occurs at the critical points, which can be found by taking the derivative and setting it to zero. However, we can see that \(g(x)\) is a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, so it will have a maximum value in \((0,1)\).

The maximum value of \(g(x)\) will be \(\lambda^2\) when \(x = 0\), and it will decrease as \(x\) increases. For \(g(x) = 1\) to have a solution in \((0,1)\), we need \(\lambda^2 > 1\), which means \(\lambda > 1\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there is a point \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) are \(\lambda > 1\).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
Using the angle addition formulas, we know that \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\ ) and \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\). However, here we can use the fact that \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\). So we rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ
\]
This can be grouped as:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ)
\]
Using the angle addition formulas again, we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (40^\circ - 35^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ +  \sin 5^\circ
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
Similarly, we can rewrite it as:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
Using the angle addition formulas again, we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

So the original expression simplifies to :
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We need to find \(\theta\) such that this equation holds. Notice that if \(\theta = 45^\circ\), then \(\tan 45^\circ = 1\). We need to check if the numerator and the denominator are equal when \(\theta = 45^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \sin (45^\circ - 40^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \cos (45^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - (\cos 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ + \sin  45^\circ \sin 40^\circ)
\]
After simplification, we can see that both the numerator and the denominator are equal when \(\theta = 45^\circ\).

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   - The centroid $W$ of triangle $ABC$ divides each median into a ratio of $2:1$. This means that $W$ is located at $\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Determine the similarity ratio:**
   - Since $WV \parallel BC$, $Wn \parallel CA$, and $ Wl \parallel AB$, triangles $WLN$ and $ABC$ are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem).
   - The similarity ratio between $\triangle WLN$ and $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ because $W$ is the centroid, and the centroid divides each median in the ratio $2:1$ .

3. **Calculate the area ratio:**
   - The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
   - Therefore, the area ratio of $\triangle WLN$ to $\triangle ABC$ is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$.

   Let \( x \) be the number of pieces weighing 500 grams each, and \( y \) be the number of pieces weighing 200 grams each.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   According to the problem, the total weight of the 20 pieces is 9000 grams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   500x + 200y = 9000

4. **Find the integer solution:**
   We know from the problem statement that the number of pieces weighing 500 grams is 8. So, let \( x = 8 \).

5. **Substitute \( x = 8 \) into the equation:**
   \[
   5(8) + 2y = 90

6. **Solve for \( y \):**
   Subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   2y = 50

   Divide by 2:
   \[
   y = 25

7. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   The total number of pieces is the sum of \( x \) and \( y \):
   \[
   x + y = 8 + 25 = 33

"To determine the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a divisor of \( n^2 \), we need to analyze the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) and the conditions under which \( n^2 \) will include \( 2^{24} \) as a factor.

1. **Prime Factorization of \( 2^{24} \)**:
   \[
   2^{24}
   \]
   This means that \( 2^{24} \) is composed entirely of the prime number 2, each raised to the power of 24.

2. **Condition for \( n^2 \) to be a multiple of \( 2^{24} \)**:
   For \( n^2 \) to be divisible by \( 2^{24} \), \( n^2 \) must include at least \( 2^{24} \) in its prime factorization. This implies that \( n \) itself must include at least \( 2^{12} \) in its prime factorization. This is because:
   \[
   (2^{12})^2 =  2^{24}
   \]

3. **Finding the smallest \( n \)**:
   The smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( 2^{12} \). Let's verify this:
   \[
   n = 2^{12}
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   n^2 = (2^{12})^2 = 2^{24}

   - Let's denote the 6 numbers by \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6\).
   - The sum of these 6 numbers is even, i.e., \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6\) is even.

   - Let's denote the sum of any 4 numbers by \(S_4 = a_i + a_j + a_k + a_l\).

4. **Use the property of even sums:**
   - If the sum of all 6 numbers is even, then the sum of any 4 numbers and the sum of the remaining 2 numbers must both be even or both be odd.
    - This is because the sum of an even number plus an even number is even, and the sum of an odd number plus an odd number is even.

1. **Identify the total area of the figure:**
   The figure is a 3x4 rectangle, so the total area is:
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 3 \times 4 = 12

2. **Identify the shaded regions:**
   There are two shaded triangles in the figure. The first triangle is a right triangle with vertices at (0, 4), (3, 4), and (3, 0). The second triangle is a right triangle with vertices at (0, 4), (2, 0), and (0, 0).

3. **Calculate the area of the first shaded triangle:**
   The first triangle has a base of 3 and a height of 4, so its area is:

" order to find a number that is a multiple of 450 and consists of the digits 0 and 1, we can start by examining the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 9 (since \(3^2 = 9\)). For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the sum of the digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, the number must have a number of 1's that is a multiple of 9.

Let's start by checking the smallest possible numbers that fit these criteria. The smallest number that ends in 0 and has a sum of digits that is a multiple  of 9 is 1111111110. Let's check if this number is a multiple of 450:

1. It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2 and 5.
2. The sum of the digits of 1111111110 is \(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0 = 9\), which is a multiple of 3 and 9.
3. Since it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 9, it is divisible by 450.

Therefore, the smallest number that is a multiple of 450 and consists of the digits 0 and 1 is:

\[
\boxed{1111111110}

This is the final answer. The smallest number that is a multiple of 450 and consists of the digits 0 and 1 is \(\boxed{1111111110}\).```

"1. **Combining Conditions into Equations:**

   Let's denote the number from the first condition by \( x \) and the number from the second condition by \( y \).

   According to the problem, we have:
   \[
   x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}
   \]
   \[
   y \equiv 1 \pmod{5}
   \]
   This means:
   \[
   x = 4a + 1 \quad \text{for some integer} \ a
   \]
   \[
   y = 5b + 1 \quad \text{for some integer} \ b
   \]

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**

   The least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20. Therefore, the smallest positive number that satisfies both congruences \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) and \( y \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) is:
   \[
   x = 20k + 1 \quad \text{for some integer} \ k
   \]
   \[
   y = 20m + 1 \quad  \text{for some integer} \ m
   \]
   This implies that both \( x \) and \( y \) can be written in the form \( 20n + 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

3. **Finding the Sum of the Numbers:**

   The sum of the numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is:
   \[
   x + y = (20k + 1) + (20m + 1) = 20k + 20m + 2 = 20(k + m) + 2
   \]

4. **Finding the Product of the Numbers:**

   The product of the numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is:
   \[
   xy = (20k + 1)(20m + 1) = 400km + 20k + 20m + 1
   \]

5. **Finding the Sum of the Squares:**

   The sum of the squares of the numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = (20k + 1)^2  + (20m + 1)^2 = 400k^2 + 40k + 1 + 400m^2 + 40m + 1 = 400(k^2 + m^2) + 40(k + m) + 2
   \]

6. **Finding the Product of the Sums of the Squares and the Numbers:**

   The product of the sum of the squares and the sum of the numbers is:
   \[
   (x^2 + y^2)(x + y) = \left( 400(k^2 + m^2) + 40(k + m) + 2 \right) \left( 20(k + m) + 2 \right)

"To find the value of the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we will use several trigonometric identities and properties.

First, we note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite some of the sine functions in the product:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) =  \sin 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to make it easier to handle:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so:
\[
(\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{ 3}{4}.
\]
Now, we need to find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\). We use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Thus,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]
Combining this with the factor from \(\sin 60^\circ\), we get :
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]
So, the value of the original product is:

2. **Analyze the equation**: In a three-dimensional coordinate system, \( z \) is the coordinate along the \( z \)-axis. When \( z = c \), it means that for any point on this curve, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) (the radial distance from the origin in the \( xy \)-plane) and \( \theta \) (the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane).

3. **Visualize the curve**: The equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions but is fixed at \( z = c \).

4. **Identify the geometric shape**: A plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at a fixed point  is known as a horizontal plane or a plane at a constant height.

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem states that a polygon has a sum of interior angles, excluding one angle, equal to $1070^\circ$.
   - We need to find the number of sides of the polygon and the measure of the excluded angle.

2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula:**
   - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by:
     \[
     S = 180(n-2)
     \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let the excluded angle be $x^\circ$. Then the sum of the remaining interior angles is $1070^\circ$.
   - Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     180(n-2) - x = 1070
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     180(n-2) = 1070 + x
     \]
     \[
     n-2 = \frac{1070 + x}{180}
     \]
   - Since \( n  \) must be an integer, \( \frac{1070 + x}{180} \) must also be an integer.

5. **Finding the Integer Solution:**
   - We need to find \( x \) such that \( \frac{1070 + x}{180} \) is an integer.
   - Let's test possible values of \( x \) to find an integer solution:
     - If \( x = 10^\circ \):
       \[
       \frac{1070 + 10}{180} = \frac{1080}{180} = 6 \quad \text{(integer)}
       \]
     - Therefore, \( x = 10^\circ \) works.

6. **Calculating \( n \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 10^\circ \) back into the equation for \( n \):
     \[
     n-2 = 6
     \]
     \[
     n = 8
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The polygon has 8 sides, and the measure of the excluded angle is \( 10^\circ \).

"1. ** interpretation of the problem:**
   We are given a positive integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \). The condition states that \( t+2 \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means:
   \[
   t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. **Expand and simplify the congruence:**
   Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
   \[
   t(t + 2) = t^2 + 2t
   \]
   Therefore, the congruence becomes:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Rearrange the congruence:**
   To make it easier to solve, we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic congruence:**
   We treat this as a quadratic equation in \( t \):
   \[
   t^2 + 2t -  1 = 0
   \]
   We can solve this using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
   \]

5. **Simplify the square root:**
   Since \( \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \), we have:
   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
   \]

6. **Consider the modulo 23:**
   We need to find the values of \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \). We will check both solutions:
    \[
   t = -1 + \sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - \sqrt{2}
   \]

7. **Evaluate the solutions modulo 23:**
   First, we approximate \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We find that:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \equiv 10 \pmod{23}
   \]
   This can be verified by checking:
   \[
   10^2 = 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
   \]

8. **Calculate the solutions:**
   \[
   t_1 = -1 + 10 = 9
   \]
   \[
   t_2 = -1 - 10 = -11 \equiv 12 \pmod{23} \quad (\text{since } -11 + 23 = 12)
   \]

9. **Verify the solutions:**
   We need to check if these values satisfy the original condition \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):
   - For \( t  = 9 \):
     \[

     \[
     12(12 + 2) = 12 \cdot 14 = 168 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

These values are obtained by solving the quadratic congruence and verifying the solutions modulo 23. The final answer is \(\boxed{9 \text{ or } 12}\).","[{9, 12}, '9 ; 12']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"П question typically asks how to find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic unit. Let's go through the steps to solve this problem.

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic unit, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1
   \]
   So, the side length of the cube is 1 unit.

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \) into the formula, we get:
   \[
   A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \times 1 = 6
    \]
   Therefore, the surface area of the cube is:
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{6}\). This is the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic unit. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!``````

    - CENSIONkatsia: $5 + \sqrt{3}$
    - N _n _atsia: $5 - \sqrt{3}$
    - Tatsia: The product of these two numbers is a rational number.

2. **Find the product**:
    \[
    (5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
    \]

3. **Use the difference of squares formula**:
    \[
    (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
    \]
    Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

4. **Substitute the values**:
    \[
    (5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
    \]

5. **Calculate the squares**:
    \[
    5^2 = 25
    \]
    \[
    (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
    \]

6. **Subtract the results**:
    \[
    25 - 3 = 22
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
    \[
    \boxed{22}
    \] 

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\) is 22, which is a rational number. This confirms the result that the product of a number and its conjugate is always rational. \\

"1. **Define the problem and initial conditions:**
   Let \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) be the sequence of odd natural numbers starting from 1, i.e., \( a_n = 2n-1 \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \).

2. **Formulate the sequence and its sum:**
   We are asked to find the sum of the first \( n \) terms of this sequence, denoted by \( S_n \).

3. **Sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers:**
   We know that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1)
   \]
   This sum can be derived using the properties of arithmetic series or by recognizing that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( n^2 \).

4. **Proof by induction:**
   We will prove that \( S_n = n^2 \) using mathematical induction.

   - **Base case:**
     For \( n = 1  \),
     \[
     S_1 = 1 = 1^2
     \]
     The base case holds.

   - **Inductive step:**
     Assume that the formula holds for some \( k \geq 1 \), i.e., \( S_k = k^2 \).

     We need to show that \( S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2 \).

     By definition,
     \[
     S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1}
     \]
     Using the inductive hypothesis \( S_k = k^2 \) and the fact that \( a_{k+1} = 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k + 1 \),
     \[
     S_{k+1} = k^2 + (2k + 1)
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side,
     \[
     S_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2
     \]
     Thus, the formula holds for \( k+1 \).

   By the principle of mathematical induction, \( S_n = n^2 \) for all \(  n \geq 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

\boxed{n^2}

"要解 $g(f(5)-1)$，我们需要遵循以下步骤：

1. 计算 $f(5)$。
2. 从步骤1的结果中减去1。
3. 将步骤2的结果作为输入到函数 $g$ 中。

从第一步开始，我们需要计算 $f(5)$。函数 $f(x)$ 定义为 $f(x) = 2x - 3$。因此，我们将 $x = 5$ 代入函数：
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
\]

接下来，我们从 $f(5)$ 的结果中减去1：
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.
\]

现在，我们需要将这个结果作为输入到函数 $g$ 中。函数 $g(x)$ 定义为 $g(x) = x + 1$。因此，我们将 $x = 6$ 代入函数：
\[
g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.

    \[
    \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
    \]

    改变 \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) 为 \(\tan^{-1}\)。
    
    \[
    \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)
    \]

    因此方程变为：

    \[
    \sin (2\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
    \]

2. **应用正弦的二倍角恒等式:**

    \[
    \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)
    \]

    这里，我们设 \(\theta = \arctan(x)\)。因此：

    \[
    \sin(2\arctan(x)) = 2\sin(\arctan(x))\cos(\arctan(x))
     \]

3. **计算 \(\sin(\arctan(x))\) 和 \(\cos(\arctan(x))\):**

    设 \(\theta = \arctan(x)\)，这意味着 \(\tan(\theta) = x\)。在直角三角形中，如果 \(\tan(\theta) = x\)，那么：

    \[
    \sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}, \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}
    \]

    因此：

    \[
    \sin(2\arctan(x)) = 2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}
    \]

4. **设置方程:**

    \[
    \frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
    \]

5. **解方程:**

    交叉相乘以消除分数：

    \[
    6x = 1 + x^2
    \]

     重新排列形成二次方程：

    \[
    x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
    \]

6. **使用二次公式解二次方程:**

    二次公式给出：

    \[
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
    \]

    这里，\(a = 1\)，\(b = -6\)，和 \(c = 1\)：

    \[
    x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}

"1. **identify the given lines:**
   The first line is given by:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The second line is given by:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **check if the lines are parallel:**
   To determine if the lines are parallel, we need to check if their direction vectors are proportional. The direction vectors are:
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   We observe that:
   \ [
   \mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1
   \]
   Therefore, the lines are parallel.

3. **check if the lines are coincident:**
   To determine if the lines are coincident, we need to check if a point on one line lies on the other line. Let's check if the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) from the first line lies on the second line. We set:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   3 = -5 + 4u
   \]
   \[
   -10 = -3 - 18u
   \]
   \[
   1 = 6 - 4u
   \]

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
    Solving the first equation for \(u\):
   \[
   3 = -5 + 4u \implies 4u = 8 \implies u = 2
   \]
   Solving the second equation for \(u\):
   \[
   -10 = -3 - 18u \implies -18u = -7 \implies u = \frac{7}{18}
   \]
   Solving the third equation for \(u\):
   \[
   1 = 6 - 4u \implies -4u = -5 \implies u = \frac{5}{4}
   \]

   Since the values of \(u\) are not consistent, the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) does not lie on the second line. Therefore, the lines are not coincident.

5. **Calculate the distance between the parallel lines:**
   The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \ mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
   \[
   d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{b}|}
   \]
   Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

   First, calculate \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
   \[
   \mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5  \end{pmatrix}

   Next, calculate the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
   \[
   \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix}

   - Point 2: \((-5, 4)\)
   - Point 3: \((5, -4)\)
   - Point 4: \((5, 4)\)

2. ** determine the center of the rectangle:**
   - The center (centroid) of a rectangle is the average of its vertices' coordinates.
   - Calculate the average of the x-coordinates:
     \[
     \frac{-5 + (-5) + 5 + 5}{4} = \frac{0}{4} = 0

     \frac{-4 + 4 + (-4) + 4}{4} = \frac{0}{4} = 0
     \]
   - Therefore, the center of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

3 . ** find the distance from the center to one of the points:**
   - Choose Point 1: \((-5, -4)\).
   - Use the distance formula:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

4. ** verify the distance to the other points:**
   - For Point 2: \((-5, 4)\):
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(-5 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}

    - For Point 3: \((5, -4)\):
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}

     d = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}

All points are equidistant from the center of the rectangle, which is the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from the center to any of the points is \(\sqrt{41}\).

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, we have:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Since the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
 We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Also, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding these vectors together, we get:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ - 42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Thus, the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}\).```\\

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), and the area of the trapezoid \([ABCD] = 42\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\) and \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: \(AD = a\), \(BC = b\), \(AB = c\), and \(CD = d\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h =  42
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is equal to \(AC\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(d = h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

From the area of the trapezoid, we know:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both the trapezoid and \(\triangle ACD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD ] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

By the properties of the trapezoid and the given conditions, we can deduce that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height \(h\) is the same for both the trapezoid and \(\triangle ACD\), and the base \(a\) is part of the total length \(a + b\) that makes up the trapezoid's area when combined with the other base \(b\).

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given operation definition \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\).

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}
\]
So, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).

Now, substitute these values into the operation definition:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Calculate the product \(7 \times 10\):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next,  simplify \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):
\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times 0.7 = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).```

"1. **Define the points and the problem:**
   Let \( A, B, C, D \) be four points taken at random and independently on a circle. We need to find the probability that the line segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect.

2. **Use symmetry and combinatorial arguments:**
   due to the symmetry of the circle, the probability that \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect is the same as the probability that they do not intersect. 

3. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   The total number of ways to choose 4 points on a circle is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]
   since there is only one way to choose 4 points out of 4.

4. **Determine the number of intersecting configurations:**
   For the line segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating manner around the circle. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must be \( A, C, B, D \) or \( A, D, B, C \).

 5. **Count the number of intersecting configurations:**
   There are exactly 2 ways to arrange the 4 points such that \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect:
   \[
   (A, C, B, D) \quad \text{and} \quad (A, D, B, C)
   \]

6. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect is the ratio of the number of intersecting configurations to the total number of configurations:
   \[
   P(\text{intersect}) = \frac{\text{Number of intersecting configurations}}{\text{Total number of configurations}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

7. **Conclusion:**
   The probability that the line segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - The radii of the circles are given as 1 and 2.
   - The combined speed of the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the speed of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the Speeds:**
   - Let the speed of the smaller circle with radius 1 be \( v_1 \).
   - Let the speed of the larger circle with radius 2 be \( v_2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( v_1 + v_2 = \frac{5}{12} v_2 \).

3. **Express \( v_1 \) in Terms of \( v_2 \):**
   \[
   v_1 + v_2 = \frac{5}{12} v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{5}{12} v_2 - v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = \left( \frac{5}{12} -  1 \right) v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = \left( \frac{5}{12} - \frac{12}{12} \right) v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = -\frac{7}{12} v_2
   \]
   Since speeds cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's assume the problem meant the combined speed of the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the speed of the larger circle in absolute terms.

4. **Re-evaluate the Speeds:**
   - Let the speed of the smaller circle be \( v_1 \).
   - Let the speed of the larger circle be \( v_2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( |v_1| + |v_2| = \frac{5}{12} v_2 \).

   Since \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are both positive (assuming circular motion in the same direction), we have:
   \[
   v_1 + v_2 = \frac{5}{12} v_2
    \]

5. **Solve for \( v_1 \):**
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{5}{12} v_2 - v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = \left( \frac{5}{12} - 1 \right) v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = \left( \frac{5}{12} - \frac{12}{12} \right) v_2
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = -\frac{7}{12} v_2
   \]

6. **Determine the Geometry:**
   - The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the angle between the tangents to the circles at point \( D \).
   - The tangents to the circles at point \( D \) form right angles with the radii at \( D \).

7. **Calculate the Angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   - The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the angle between the lines connecting the centers of the circles to point \( D \).
   - The angle between the radii of the circles at point \( D \ ) is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (90 degrees) because the circles are tangent at \( D \).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is \( \boxed{90} \) degrees. 

Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is \(\boxed{90}\).```

   - Let \( a = 8 \) cm (height of the first triangle)
   - Let \( b = 3 \) cm (base of the first triangle)
   - Let \( c = 6 \) cm (height of the second triangle)

2. **Determine the area of the first triangle:**
   The area \( A_1 \) of the first triangle with base \( b \) and height \( a \) is given by:
   \[
   A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 3 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 24 = 12 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the second triangle:**
   The area \( A_2 \) of the second triangle with base \( c \) and height \( c \) is given by:
   \[
   A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot c
    \]
   Substituting the given value:
   \[
   A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 36 = 18 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

4. **Determine the ratio of the areas of the two triangles:**
   The ratio of the areas of the two triangles is:
   \[

   \]

5. **Determine the ratio of the bases of the two triangles:**
   The ratio of the bases of the two triangles is:
   \[
   \frac{c}{b} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

6. **Determine the ratio of the heights of the two triangles:**
   Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides (including heights), we can use the ratio of the areas to find the ratio of the heights:
   \[
   \left( \frac{c}{b} \right)^2  = \frac{A_2}{A_1}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \left( \frac{6}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   2^2 = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   \[
   4 = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

   This indicates an error in our assumption of similarity. Instead, we use the correct ratio for heights directly:
   \[
   \frac{c}{a} = \sqrt{\frac{A_2}{A_1}}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

7. **Determine the base of the second triangle:**
   Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the bases is equal to the ratio of the heights:
   \[
   \frac{c}{a} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

   Solving for the unknown base \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{6}{ x} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]
   Cross-multiplying:
   \[
   6 \cdot 4 = 3 \cdot x
   \]
   \[
   24 = 3x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ cm}

The final answer is \(\boxed{8 \text{ cm}}\).```

"Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find the value of \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We already know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\).

For \(\alpha\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha } = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

For \(\beta\):
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the formulas for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta =  0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
 \]

We now need to compute the product:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right)
\]

Using the difference of squares formula \( (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100} = \frac{( \sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2}{100} = \frac{21 - 12}{100} = \frac{9}{100}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to form a bill that has exactly 5 pieces, with at least one piece coming from the set of 8 repreesentations and at least one piece coming from the set of 6 repeated pieces.

Let's denote the set of 8 repreesentations as \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_8\} \) and the set of 6 repeated pieces as \( B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_6\} \).

We need to count the number of ways to choose 5 pieces such that at least one piece is from \( A \) and at least one piece is from \( B \). This can be done by subtracting the number of ways to choose 5 pieces from either \( A \) or \( B \) (but not both) from the total number of ways to choose 5 pieces from the combined set \( A \cup B \).

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 pieces from the combined set \( A \cup B \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5}
   \]
    where \( \binom{14}{5} \) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose 5 items from 14 items.

2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 pieces from the set \( A \) (i.e., no pieces from \( B \)):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 pieces from the set \( B \) (i.e., no pieces from \( A \)):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of ways to choose 5 pieces from \( A \) or \( B \) from the total number of ways to choose 5 pieces from \( A \cup B \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5}

Now, let's compute these values:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002 
\]
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
\]
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
\]

So, the number of ways to form a bill with exactly 5 pieces, with at least one piece from \( A \) and at least one piece from \( B \), is:
\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Thus, the final answer is:

   \frac{abc}{40} = 24 \implies abc = 24 \times 40 = 960
   \]

Now, we need to find the value of \(a + b + c\), which we already know is 120.  However, the problem asks for the value of the arithmetic mean of the three bottom variables, which is:
\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
\]

Thus, the value of the arithmetic mean of the three bottom variables is \(\boxed{40}\).```

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).

Let's start with the given equation:

\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, notice that the expression inside the cube root can be simplified. The expression \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt[3]{(x-2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, to eliminate the cube root, we cube both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{(x-2)^2}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, we need to solve for \(x \). We do this by taking the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives us both the positive and the negative roots:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]
\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

So the solutions to the equation are:

\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{66 \text{ or } -62}

The final answer is $\boxed{66 \text{ or } -62}$.```

\[
\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

This identity can be derived from the polynomial whose roots are \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi k}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 7\), which is related to the 15th roots of unity. However, for the purpose of this problem,  we can use this known result.

Therefore, we have:

\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{16}.

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), and point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) with \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Consider \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\), \(AM = 11\) and \(AD = 10\), so \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We can use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD }
\]
Since \(\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{BD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
Similarly, in \(\triangle ABD\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB}
\]
Since \(\angle ADB = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{AB}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Thus, we can write:
\[
BD = AB \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
And:
\[
CD = AC \cdot \frac{\sin \ theta}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
BC = BD + CD = AB \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta} + AC \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta} = AB \cdot \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle formula for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta\), we get:
\[
BC = AB \cdot \frac{2 \sin \theta}{3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta} = AB \cdot \frac{2}{3 - 4 \sin^2 \theta}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), we can use the fact that \(AM\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) in the isosceles triangle. The height from \(A\) to \(BC\) splits \(BC\) into two equal segments, so:
\[
AM = \sqrt{AB^2 - \left(\frac{BC }{2}\right)^2}
\]
Substituting \(AM = 11\) and solving for \(BC\), we find that:
\[
BC = 22 \cos \theta
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 22 \cos \theta = 2 \cdot 11 + 22 \cos \theta = 22 + 22 = 44

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

"1. **Understand the problem context**: The problem is asking for the smallest number of digits in the number \(3^7\).

2. **Calculate \(3^7\)**: 
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
   \]
   We can break this down step-by-step:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
   \[
   9 \times 3 = 27
   \]
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]
   \[
   81 \times 3 = 243
   \]
   \[
   243 \times 3 = 729
   \]
   \[
   729 \times 3 = 2187
   \]
   Therefore, 
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]

3. **Count the digits in \(2187\)**: 
   The number \(2187\) has four digits .

4. **Verify using logarithms**:
   We can use logarithms to determine the number of digits in \(3^7\). The number of digits \(d\) in a number \(n\) is given by:
   \[
   d = \lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1
   \]
   For \(n = 3^7\):
   \[
   \log_{10} (3^7) = 7 \log_{10} 3
   \]
   Using the approximation \(\log_{10} 3 \approx 0.4771\):
   \[
   7 \log_{10} 3 \approx 7 \times 0.4771 = 3.3397
   \]
   \[
   \lfloor 3.3397 \rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

   Therefore, \(3^7\) has 4 digits.

"1. **Define the function and its domain:**

   Given the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \). The domain of this function is all real numbers \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

2. **Simplify the inequality:**

   Since \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) for all \( x \) (because both \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are non-negative), the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \) is always true. Therefore, we only need to focus on the upper bound:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

3. **Substitute \( y = x^2 \):**

   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic inequality:**

   Rearrange the inequality to standard quadratic form:
    \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]

   To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0
   \]

   Using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]

   This gives us two roots:
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad  \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
   \]

5. **Determine the intervals:**

   The roots \( y = 3 \) and \( y = -7 \) divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

6. **Test the intervals:**

   We test a value from each interval in the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \):
   - For \( y \in (-\infty, -7) \), choose \( y = -8 \):
     \[
     (-8)^2 + 4(-8) - 21 = 64 - 32 - 21 = 11 \quad (\text{not less than 0})
     \]
   - For \( y \in (-7, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
     \[
     0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 \quad (\text{less than 0})
      \]
   - For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
     \[
     4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 \quad (\text{not less than 0})
     \]

   Therefore, the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) holds for \( y \in (-7, 3) \).

7. **Convert back to \( x \):**

   Recall that \( y = x^2 \). Thus, the inequality \( x^2 < 3 \) gives us:
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**

   The solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
   \[
   \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}
   \] 

   Therefore, the values of \( x \) are in the interval \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\).","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
 \[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Also, recall another identity:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and the given value \(12\) for the left-hand side, we get:
\[
12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = sp - 12.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
 -8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s \left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s \left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
So we have:
\[
s^3 - 72 = -8,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
and thus:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(sp = 24\), we get:
\[
4p = 24,
\]
so:
\[
p = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then combine the results.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative because it is an absolute value. Therefore, the fraction will be negative if the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is negative. So, we need to find where \(x^2 - 36x < 0\).

Factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
The expression \(x(x - 36)\) is a parabola that opens upwards and crosses the x-axis at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The expression is negative between the roots, so:
\[
x(x - 36) < 0 \quad \text{for} \quad 0 < x < 36.
 \]
Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) holds for \(0 < x < 36\).

However, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero, which means \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\). Since \(0 < x < 36\) already excludes \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the garden in square meters. The garden is described as having a semicircle on each side of a rectangle. The rectangle has a length of 3 meters and a width of 2 meters. The semicircles have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 2 meters, so the radius of each semicircle is 1 meter.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ square meters}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of one semicircle. The area of a full circle is given by the formula \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. Since we have a semicircle, we need to take half of the area of a full circle:
\[
\text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (1)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \text{ square meters}
\]
 Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:
\[
\text{Total area of the semicircles} = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi = \pi \text{ square meters}
\]

Now, we add the area of the rectangle and the area of the semicircles to get the total area of the garden:
\[
\text{Total area of the garden} = \text{Area of the rectangle} + \text{Total area of the semicircles} = 6 + \pi \text{ square meters}

Since \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we can approximate the total area as:

6 + \pi \approx 6 + 3.14 = 9.14 \text{ square meters}

"1. **Determine the coordinates of points A and B:**

   The problem states that points A and B lie on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \).

   For point A:
   \[
   y = 0 \implies \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = 0 \implies x^2 - 3 = 0 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{3}
   \]
   Thus, point A can be either \( (\sqrt{3}, 0) \) or \( (-\sqrt{3}, 0) \).

   For point B:
   \[
   y = 1 \implies \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = 1 \implies x^2 - 3 = \sqrt{2} \implies x^2 = 3 + \sqrt{2}
   \]
   Thus, point B is \( \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}}, 1 \right) \).

2. **Calculate the distance AB:**

    Using the distance formula between points \( (\sqrt{3}, 0) \) and \( \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}}, 1 \right) \):
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{ \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - 0 \right)^2 }
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the square root:
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{ \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 + 1 }
   \]

3. **Simplify \( \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 \):**

   Using the binomial expansion:
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 = \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{3} + \left( \sqrt{3} \right)^2 
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 3 + \sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{3} \right)^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{3(3 + \sqrt{2})} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 = 3 + \sqrt{2} - 2 \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}} + 3 = 6 + \sqrt{2} - 2 \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the distance formula:**

   \[
   AB = \sqrt{ 6 + \sqrt{2} - 2 \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2 }} + 1 } = \sqrt{ 7 + \sqrt{2} - 2 \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}} }
   \]

5. **Express \( \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}} \) in the form \( \sqrt{a} + b \):**

   Assume \( \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{a} + b \). Square both sides:
   \[
   9 + 3\sqrt{2} = a + b^2 + 2b \sqrt{a}
   \]
   Equate the rational and irrational parts:
   \[
   a + b^2 = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad 2b \sqrt{a} = 3\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Solving the second equation:
   \[
   2b \sqrt{a} = 3\sqrt{2} \implies b \sqrt{a} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \implies b^2 a = \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4} = \frac{9}{2} \ implies 2(a + b^2) = \frac{9}{2}
   \]
   From \( a + b^2 = 9 \):
   \[
   2 \cdot 9 = \frac{9}{2} \quad \text{which is not possible}
   \]

6. **Re-examine the assumption and solve correctly:**

   Correct form should be:
   \[
   \sqrt{9 + 3\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}
   \]
   Square both sides:
   \[
   9 + 3\sqrt{2} = a + b + 2\sqrt{ab}
   \]
   Equate rational and irrational parts:
   \[
   a + b = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad 2\sqrt{ab} = 3\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Solving the second equation:
   \[
   2\sqrt{ab} = 3\sqrt{2} \implies \sqrt{ab} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \implies ab = \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4 The final answer is  \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 8 \).
   \[
   a + b = 11

     \[
     -x^2 + 2x + 3 =  0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0

     \[
     -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0

     通过试错或使用数值方法，我们发现 \( x = 2 \) 不是有效的，因为它不满足方程。因此，没有 \( x > 3 \) 的有效解。

"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we first need to identify the coordinates of the vertices of the octahedron and the point \( P \).

The octahedron can be visualized as having vertices at the points \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\). These vertices form two pyramids joined at their bases, with the base being a square in the \(xy\)-plane, \(xz\)-plane, and \(yz\)-plane respectively.

Given the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices \( A = (1,0,0) \), \( B = (-1,0,0) \), \( C = (0,1,0) \), \( D = (0,-1,0) \), and \( E = (0,0,1) \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively, we can use the distance formula to set up equations for the coordinates of \( P = (x, y, z) \ ).

The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( C \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( D \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
Squaring both sides,  we get:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]

We now have five equations:
1. \((x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9\)
2. \((x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49\)
3. \(x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64\)
4. \(x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81\)
5. \(x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121\)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 -  z^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 - y^2 - z^2 = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Subtract the third equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2) = 81 - 64
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 2y - 1 - z^2 = 17
\]
\[
4y = 17
\]
\[
y = \frac{17}{4}
\]

Subtract the fifth equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2) = 81 - 121
 \]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 + 2z - 1 = -40
\]
\[
2y + 2z = -40
\]
\[
y + z = -20
\]
\[
z = -20 - \frac{17}{4} = -\frac{80}{4} - \frac{17}{4} = -\frac{97}{4}
\]

Now we can find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex, which is \((0,0,-1)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + \left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{97}{4} + 1\right)^2}

"1. **Define the variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the speed of the car in grams per second.
   Let \( y \) be the time in seconds.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   According to the problem, the mass of the car and the speed are related by the equation:
   \[
   x \cdot y = 200
   \]
   The problem also states that the time taken to travel the same distance at a different speed is 2 seconds longer:
   \[
   y + 2 = \frac{200}{150}
   \]

3. **Simplify the second equation:**
   Simplify the fraction on the right-hand side:
   \[
   y + 2 = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3} - 2
   \]
   Convert 2 to a fraction with a common denominator:
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{6}{3 } = -\frac{2}{3}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( y \) back into the first equation:**
   \[
   x \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) = 200
   \]
   Solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by \(-\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   x = 200 \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -300
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The speed of the car is \(-300\) grams per second, which is not physically possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the interpretation of the problem or the given values. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the equations.

   Revisiting the problem, we realize that the time taken at the slower speed should be 2 seconds shorter, not longer. Therefore, the correct equation should be:
   \[
   y - 2 = \frac{200}{150}
   \]

   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   y - 2 = \frac{4}{3}
   \]

    Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3} + 2
   \]
   Convert 2 to a fraction with a common denominator:
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{6}{3} = \frac{10}{3}
   \]

   Substitute \( y \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   x \cdot \left(\frac{10}{3}\right) = 200
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 200 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{10}\right) = 60
   \]

   Therefore, the speed of the car is \(\boxed{60}\) grams per second. The time taken at the faster speed is:
   \[
   y = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3}
   \]

   The correct interpretation of the problem gives us the speed of the car as \(\boxed{60}\) grams per second. The time taken at the faster speed is \(\frac{10}{3}\) seconds.","[60, '60']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False

A group of people has to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. Let's denote the number of people as \( n \).

The problem is to find out how many people can cross the river if \( n = 5 \). Assume that the liar is not allowed to be in the same boat with another liar, and the boat can't cross the river alone. Also, the boat must return to the original side at least once to pick up another person.

"给定的多项式 \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \) 是一个4次的多项式。为了找到 \( g(x) = f(x-1) \)，我们需要将 \( x-1 \) 代入 \( f(x) \) 中的 \( x \)。

首先，让我们用 \( x-1 \) 表达 \( f(x-1) \)：
\[
f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
\]

我们需要展开每一项：
1. 展开 \( (x-1)^4 \)：
\[
(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]
因此，
\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
\]

2.  展开 \( (x-1)^2 \)：
\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]
因此，
\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5
\]

3. 展开 \( -9(x-1) \)：
\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9
\]

现在，将所有这些项组合起来：
\[
g(x) = f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2

合并同类项：
\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2)
\]
\[
g(x) =  3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15

" order to find the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2, we can use the point-to-line distance formula. The formula for the distance from a point (x1, y1) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line y = 2x - 2 in the standard form Ax + By + C = 0. Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0

Here, A = -2, B = 1, and C = 2. The point (x1, y1) is (6, 0). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[

\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]
我们被要求找到集合 \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \ alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) 的值。为了做到这一点，我们首先计算所有可能的两个根的乘积之和：
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
这可以重写为：
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = 0.
\]
设 \(S = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)，\(T = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\)，和 \(U = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) 。那么我们有：
\[
S + T + U = 0.
\]
为了找到 \(S, T, U\) 的可能值，我们考虑多项式的根。根是复数，我们可以使用二次方程的性质来帮助我们。多项式可以分解为：
\[
(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2,
\]
其中 \(a, b, c, d\) 是实数。展开这个乘积，我们得到：
\[
x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2.
\]
通过比较系数，我们得到：
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]
从 \(a + c = 2\)，我们可以表示 \(c\) 为 \(c = 2 - a\)。将 \(c = 2 - a\) 代入 \(ac + b + d =  0\)，我们得到：
\[
a(2 - a) + b + d = 0 \implies 2a - a^2 + b + d = 0 \implies b + d = a^2 - 2a.
\]
将 \(c = 2 - a\) 代入 \(ad + bc = 0\)，我们得到：
\[
ad + b(2 - a) = 0 \implies ad + 2b - ab = 0 \implies ad - ab + 2b = 0 \implies b(a - 2) = -ad.
\]
从 \(bd = 2\)，我们有 \(b = \frac{2}{d}\)。将 \(b = \frac{2}{d}\) 代入 \(b + d = a^2 - 2a\)，我们得到：
\[
\frac{2}{d} + d = a^2 - 2a.
\]
将 \(b = \frac{2}{d}\) 代入 \(b(a - 2) = -ad\)，我们得到：
\[
\frac{2}{d}(a - 2) = -ad  \implies 2(a - 2) = -ad^2 \implies 2a - 4 = -ad^2 \implies ad^2 + 2a = 4 \implies a(d^2 + 2) = 4 \implies a = \frac{4}{d^2 + 2}.
\]
将 \(a = \frac{4}{d^2 + 2}\) 代入 \(b + d = a^2 - 2a\)，我们得到：
\[
b + d = \left(\frac{4}{d^2 + 2}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{4}{d^2 + 2}\right) = \frac{16}{(d^2 + 2)^2} - \frac{8}{d^2 + 2} = \frac{16 - 8(d^2 + 2)}{(d^2 + 2)^2} = \frac{16 - 8d^2 - 16}{(d^2 + 2)^2} = \frac{-8d^2}{(d^2 + 2)^2}.

"Let's denote the price of one notebook by \( n \), the price of one pen by \( p \), and the price of one pen goyma by \( g \).

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 3n + p + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( n + p + 3g = 1.82 \)

We need to find the price of one notebook, \( n \).

First, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( p \):
\[ (3n + p + g) - (n + p + 3g) = 1.24 - 1.82 \]
\[ 3n + p + g - n - p - 3g = -0.58 \]
\[ 2n - 2g = -0.58 \]
\[ n - g = -0.29 \]
\[ n = g - 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( n = g - 0.29 \) into the first equation:
\[ 3(g - 0.29) + p + g = 1.24 \ ]
\[ 3g - 0.87 + p + g = 1.24 \]
\[ 4g + p - 0.87 = 1.24 \]
\[ 4g + p = 2.11 \]
\[ p = 2.11 - 4g \]

Now we have \( n = g - 0.29 \) and \( p = 2.11 - 4g \). We need to find \( n \). Since \( p \) must be a positive value, we need to check the possible values for \( g \).

Let's test some values for \( g \). If \( g = 0.30 \):
\[ n = 0.30 - 0.29 = 0.01 \]
\[ p = 2.11 - 4 \times 0.30 = 2.11 - 1.20 = 0.91 \]

Let's verify these values in the original equations:
1. \( 3n + p + g = 3 \times 0.01 + 0.91 + 0.30 =  0.03 + 0.91 + 0.30 = 1.24 \)
2. \( n + p + 3g = 0.01 + 0.91 + 3 \times 0.30 = 0.01 + 0.91 + 0.90 = 1.82 \)

Both equations are satisfied, so the price of one notebook is \( n = 0.01 \) dollars, or 1 cent.

Therefore, the price of one notebook is \(\boxed{0.01}\).```

"1. **Determine the fraction of the cake each person has:**
   The cake is divided into 500 equal pieces. Each person receives $\frac{137}{500}$ of the cake.

2. **Calculate the number of people:**
   To find the number of people, we need to divide the whole cake (which is represented as 1) by the fraction each person receives. This can be done by multiplying by the reciprocal of $\frac{137}{500}$.
   \[
   \text{Number of people} = \frac{1}{\frac{137}{500}} = 1 \times \frac{500}{137} = \frac{500}{137}
   \]

3. **Perform the division to find the exact number of people:**
   \[
   \frac{500}{137} \approx 3.6496
   \]
   Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{500}{137} \right\rfloor  = 3
   \]

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, we can multiply the number of people by the fraction each person receives and check if it equals the whole cake.
   \[
   3 \times \frac{137}{500} = \frac{411}{500}
   \]
   Since $\frac{411}{500}$ is less than 1, it confirms that the division is correct and that there are not enough pieces for 4 people.

"1. **Define the coordinates of the vertices:**
   Let the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\) be:
   \[
   A = (0, 0), \quad B = (a, 0), \quad C = (a, b), \quad D = (0, b)
   \]
   Given that \(AB = AD = k\), we have:
   \[
   AB = a = k \quad \text{and} \quad AD = b = k
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates simplify to:
   \[
   A = (0, 0), \quad B = (k, 0), \quad C = (k, k), \quad D = (0, k)
   \]

2. **Find the coordinates of point \(O\):**
   The point \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, so \(O\) is the midpoint of both \(AC\) and \(BD\). The coordinates of \(O\) are:
   \[
   O = \left( \frac{0+k}{2}, \frac{0+k}{2 } \right) = \left( \frac{k}{2}, \frac{k}{2} \right)
   \]

3. **Determine the equation of the line \(AO\):**
   The slope of the line \(AO\) is:
   \[
   \text{slope of } AO = \frac{\frac{k}{2} - 0}{\frac{k}{2} - 0} = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the equation of the line \(AO\) is:
   \[
   y = x
   \]

4. **Find the points where the line \(AO\) intersects the sides of the rectangle:**
   - **Intersection with \(AB\):**
     The line \(AB\) is vertical at \(x = k\). Substituting \(x = k\) into the equation of \(AO\):
     \[
     y = k
     \]
     So, the intersection point is \((k, k)\), which is point \(C\).

   - **Intersection with \(AD\):**
     The line \(AD\) is horizontal at \(y = k\). Substituting \(y = k\) into the equation of \(AO\):
     \[
     x  = k
     \]
     So, the intersection point is \((k, k)\), which is point \(C\).

5. **Determine the segment \(AO\):**
   The segment \(AO\) is the line segment from \(A\) to \(O\). The length of \(AO\) is:
   \[
   AO = \sqrt{\left( \frac{k}{2} - 0 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{2} - 0 \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{k}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2 \left( \frac{k}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

6. **Determine the segment \(OC\):**
   The segment \(OC\) is the line segment from \(O\) to \(C\). The length of \(OC\) is:
   \[
   OC = \sqrt{\left( k - \frac{k}{2} \right)^2 + \left( k - \frac{k}{2 } \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{k}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

7. **Calculate the probability:**
   Since \(AO\) and \(OC\) are equal, the probability that point \(E\) lies on \(AO\) is:
   \[
   \frac{AO}{AO + OC} = \frac{\frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{\frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2}}{k\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}

Therefore, the probability that point \(E\) lies on \(AO\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).```

"1. **Evaluating $f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$:**
   - Since $\frac{\pi}{3} < 4$, we use the second case of the function $f(n) = \lceil n \rceil$.
   - Therefore, $f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left\lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \right\rceil$.
   - We know that $\frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047$, so $\left\lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \right\rceil = 2$.
   - Hence, $f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2$.

2. **Evaluating $f(\sqrt{45})$:**
   - We need to determine whether $\sqrt{45} \geq 4$ or $\sqrt{45} < 4$.
   - Since $45 > 16$, it follows that $\sqrt{45} > 4$.
   - Therefore, we use the first case of the function $f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor$.
    - Hence, $f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor$.
   - We know that $\sqrt{45} \approx 6.708$, so $\lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = 6$.
   - Therefore, $f(\sqrt{45}) = 6$.

3. **Evaluating $f(8^{2/3})$:**
   - First, we simplify $8^{2/3}$.
   - Since $8 = 2^3$, we have $8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4$.
   - Therefore, $f(8^{2/3}) = f(4)$.
   - Since $4 \geq 4$, we use the first case of the function $f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor$.
   - Hence, $f(4) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4$.
   - Therefore, $f(8^{2/3}) = 4$.

4. **Summing the evaluated values: **
   - We add the results from the above steps:
   \[
   f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12.

   - Let \( n_3 \) be the number of students who obtained 100.
   - From the problem, we know:

   -  Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S = 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given information and set up equations based on the relationships between the numbers in the grid.

The grid is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
2 & n & n-1 \\
\end{array}
\]

We are given that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal is equal. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

### Step 1: Sum of the first row
The sum of the numbers in the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Sum of the second row
The sum of the numbers in the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Sum of the third row
The sum of the numbers in the third  row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows are equal, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 4: Solving for \( n \)
Solving the equation \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

### verification:
To ensure our solution is correct, we can check the sums of the columns and diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

#### Column sums:
1. First column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

2. Second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3  + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]

3. Third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

#### Diagonal sums:
1. First diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

2. Second diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

"给定 \(\omega\) 是一个复数, 使得 \(\omega^3 = 1\) 且 \(\omega \neq 1\)，我们知道 \(\omega\) 和 \(\omega^2\) 是二次方程 \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) 的根。这意味着 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)。

我们需要找到 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值。

首先，让我们为两个分数找到一个共同的分母：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
由于 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)，我们有 \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\)。将这个结果代入分子中，我们得到：
\ [
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
现在，让我们简化分母：
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
由于 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，我们有：
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
因此，表达式简化为：
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
因此，值是 \(\boxed{1}\)。```

"1. **相同符号**：问题要求我们找到一个点 \( P \)，使得 \( PA = PB = PC \)。这表明 \( P \) 是三角形 \( ABC \) 的外心，即通过三角形所有三个顶点的圆的中心。

2. **确定外心**：三角形的外心是三角形边的垂直平分线的交点。让我们找到三角形 \( ABC \) 的边的垂直平分线的方程。

3. **边 \( AB \) 的垂直平分线**：
    - \( A = (-3, 3) \) 和 \( B = (3, 0) \)
    - \( AB \) 的斜率：\( m_{AB} = \frac{0 - 3}{3 - (-3)} = \frac{-3}{6} = -\frac{1}{2} \)
    - 垂直平分线的斜率：\( m_{\text{垂直}} = 2 \)（因为垂直线的斜率是原斜率的负倒数）
    - 中点 \( M_{AB} = \left( \frac{-3 + 3}{2}, \ frac{3 + 0}{2} \right) = (0, 1.5) \)
    - 垂直平分线的方程：\( y - 1.5 = 2(x - 0) \) 或 \( y = 2x + 1.5 \)

4. **边 \( AC \) 的垂直平分线**：
    - \( A = (-3, 3) \) 和 \( C = (0, -4) \)
    - \( AC \) 的斜率：\( m_{AC} = \frac{-4 - 3}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-7}{3} \)
    - 垂直平分线的斜率：\( m_{\text{垂直}} = \frac{3}{7} \)
    - 中点 \( M_{AC} = \left( \frac{-3 + 0}{2}, \frac{3 - 4}{2} \right) = \left( -1.5, -0.5 \right) \)
    - 垂直平分线的方程：\( y + 0.5 = \frac{3 }{7}(x + 1.5) \)
      简化：\( y + 0.5 = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{3}{7} \cdot 1.5 \)
      \( y + 0.5 = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{4.5}{7} \)
      \( y = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{4.5}{7} - 0.5 \)
      \( y = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{4.5 - 3.5}{7} \)
      \( y = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{1}{7} \)

5. **边 \( BC \) 的垂直平分线**：
    - \( B = (3, 0) \) 和 \( C = (0, -4) \)
    - \( BC \) 的斜率：\( m_{BC} = \frac{-4 - 0}{0 - 3} = \frac{-4}{-3} = \frac{4}{3} \)
    - 垂直平分线 的斜率：\( m_{\text{垂直}} = -\frac{3}{4} \)
    - 中点 \( M_{BC} = \left( \frac{3 + 0}{2}, \frac{0 - 4}{2} \right) = \left( 1.5, -2 \right) \)
    - 垂直平分线的方程：\( y + 2 = -\frac{3}{4}(x - 1.5) \)
      简化：\( y + 2 = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{4.5}{4} \)
      \( y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{4.5}{4} - 2 \)
      \( y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{4.5 - 8}{4} \)
      \( y = -\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{3.5}{4} \)
      \( y = -\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{7}{8} \)

6. **找到交点**：
     - 解方程组：
      \[
      y = 2x + 1.5
      \]
      \[
      y = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{1}{7}
      \]
    - 将方程设置为相等：
      \[
      2x + 1.5 = \frac{3}{7}x + \frac{1}{7}
      \]
    - 乘以7以清除分数：
      \[
      14x + 10.5 = 3x + 1
      \]
    - 合并同类项：
      \[
      14x - 3x = 1 - 10.5
      \]
      \[
      11x = -9.5
      \]
      \[
      x = -\frac{9.5}{11} = -\frac{19}{22}
      \]
    - 将 \( x = -\frac{19}{22} \) 代入 \( y = 2x + 1.5 \)：
      \[
      y = 2 \left( The final answer is  \boxed{ \frac{-19}{22} } \) } \]","[-19/22, '\\frac{-19}{22}']",13,"[13, '13']",False
