"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(\angle D\) is a right angle, we need to find the length of \(DE\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) where \(EF = 7\).

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), and knowing that \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to \(\angle D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

We can solve for \(DE\) by rearranging the equation:

\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = \frac{7}{\frac{7}{10}} = 7 \times \frac{10}{7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"To solve for \( w \) given that \( w \) is a rotation of \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Find the vector from \( c \) to \( z \):**
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate the vector \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \ ), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta) \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

   Therefore, the rotated vector is:
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can distribute this product:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

4. **Add the result to \( c \) to find \( w \):**
   \[
   w = c + (4 - 2i) = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by factoring 242 into its prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factor 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11^2.\]

Putting it all together, we get:
\[242 = 2 \times 11^2.\]

Now, we can take the square root of both sides:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

"To expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) using the binomial theorem, we follow these steps:

The binomial theorem states that:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
For our expression, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

The general term in the expansion is given by:
\[
T_{k+1} = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
We need to find the term for each \(k\) from 0 to 5.

1. For \(k = 0\):
\[
T_1 = \binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^5 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 = 1 \cdot (10x^3)^5  \cdot 1 = 10^5 x^{15} = 100000 x^{15}

2. For \(k = 1\):
\[

\]

3. For \(k = 2\):
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot 10^3 x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x^{-4} = 10 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x^5 = 2500 x^5

4. For \(k = 3\):
\[
T_4 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 10^2 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125
\]

5. For \(k = 4\):
\[
T_5 = \binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^1 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot 10 x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{16} x^{-8} = 5 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{1}{16} x^{-5} = \frac{50}{16} x^{-5} = \frac{25}{8} x^{-5}

6. For \(k = 5\):
\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the value of \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7} \).

First, substitute \( n = 2 + 7k \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 7k + 2)(2 + 7k + 4)(2 + 7k + 6) = (4 + 7k)(6 + 7k)(8 + 7k)
\]

Since we are working modulo 7, we can simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
4 + 7k \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 + 7k \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 + 7k \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[

Now, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Next, find \( 24 \pmod{7} \):

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \implies 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the value of \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7} \) is:

3. Verify the pattern holds for the given terms.

The sequence given is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

This sequence is known as the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Let's verify this pattern with the given terms:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \((x, y)\) that lies on the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), with the condition that \(x > 7\). Then, we need to find the value of \(x + y\).

First, let's find the equation of the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). We can use the two-point form of the equation of a line, which is:

\[ y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} (x - x_1) \]

Using the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), the slope \(m\) is:

\[ m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5 \]

So, the equation of the line is:

\[ y - 3 = 5(x - 5) \]
\[ y - 3 = 5x - 25 \]
 \[ y = 5x - 22 \]

Now, we need to find a point \((x, y)\) on this line where \(x > 7\). Let's choose \(x = 8\) (any value greater than 7 would work, but 8 is a simple choice):

\[ y = 5(8) - 22 = 40 - 22 = 18 \]

So, the point is \((8, 18)\). Now, we need to find the value of \(x + y\):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\) has vertical asymptotes at \(x = a\), \(x = b\), and a horizontal asymptote at \(y = c\). We will then find the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero. Therefore, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]

We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

Setting each factor to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7 \]
\[ x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2 \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore,  \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches infinity. For a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials.

The degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\).

Thus, \(c = 0\).

### Step 3: Calculate \(a + b + c\)
Now, we sum the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for any vector \(\bold{v}\). This inequality implies that the operator norm (or operator norm) of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) is at most \( C \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is defined as the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A\bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|}\) for all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\).

First, let's denote the matrix by \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of \( A \) is given by the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A  \). Here, \( A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). So, we need to compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which is given by the determinant of \( A^T A - \lambda I \):

\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17 \lambda + 16 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 16 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of 16, which is 4. Therefore, the smallest \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is \( C = 4 \).

Thus, the value of \( C \) is \(\boxed{4}\). The vector \(\mathbf{a}\) in the problem is not specified, but the value of \( C \) is a constant that bounds the operator norm of the given matrix. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\).```\\

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get :

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base-9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base-9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Thus, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base-9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\). also, it is clear that the result is a valid base-9 number because it does not contain any digit greater than or equal to 9. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed. The final answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).}.\)````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"要解表达式 \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\)，我们首先将 \(\sec x\) 用 \(\cos x\) 的形式表示。回想 \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\)。因此，表达式变为：

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationships between the statements given. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the initial statements:**
   - If you are a cat, then you are a dog.
   - If you are a dog, then you are a cat.

2. **Analyze the logical implications:**
   - The first statement tells us that if something is a cat, then it is also a dog. This can be written as: \( \text{Cat} \implies \text{Dog} \).
   - The second statement tells us that if something is a dog, then it is also a cat. This can be written as: \( \text{Dog} \implies \text{Cat} \).

3. **Combine the statements:**
   - If something is a cat, then it is a dog.
   - If something is a dog, then it is a cat.
   - Therefore, something can only be a cat if it is also a dog, and something can only be a dog if it is also a cat. This means that being a cat is equivalent to being a dog. We can write this as: \( \text{Cat} \iff \text {Dog} \).

4. **Apply the combined statement to the problem:**
   - The problem asks us to determine if being a cat implies being a dog, and if being a dog implies being a cat.
   - From the combined statement \( \text{Cat} \iff \text{Dog} \), we know that if something is a cat, then it is a dog, and if something is a dog, then it is a cat.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The statement "" being a cat implies being a dog, and being a dog implies being a cat"" is true based on the combined statement \( \text{Cat} \iff \text{Dog} \).

Therefore, the answer is: \(\boxed{\text{Yes}}\).``` 

This solution is based on the logical equivalence of the statements and the interpretation of the problem. The key is to understand that the statements imply that being a cat is the same as being a dog. This is a classic example of a biconditional statement, where both implications are true. The solution is straightforward once the logical structure is understood.

"Given the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that their product equals the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

Let's start by expanding the product of the two polynomials:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will expand this step by step:

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
 \[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Group the terms by their powers of \(t\):

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal the given polynomial:

\[
12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
 \]

By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and doesn't provide new information)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations one by one.

From equation 2:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

From equation 5:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3 to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is true.

Finally, verify equation 4:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16 
\]
This is also true.

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Now, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\). \\\

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume and the surface area of a cylinder. The volume \(V\) and the surface area \(A\) of a cylinder are given by the formulas:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh \]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the volume is \(20\pi\). Therefore, we can write:
\[ \pi r^2 h = 20\pi \]
Dividing both sides by \(\pi\), we get:
\[ r^2 h = 20 \]

We need to find the surface area \(A\) in terms of \(r\) and \(h\). First, let's express \(h\) in terms of \(r\) using the volume equation:
\[ h = \frac{20}{r^2} \]

Now substitute \(h\) into the surface area formula:
\[ A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r \left(\frac{20}{r^2}\right) \]
\[ A = 2\pi r^ 2 + \frac{40\pi}{r} \]

To find the minimum surface area, we take the derivative of \(A\) with respect to \(r\) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dr} = 4\pi r - \frac{40\pi}{r^2} \]
\[ 4\pi r - \frac{40\pi}{r^2} = 0 \]
\[ 4\pi r = \frac{40\pi}{r^2} \]
\[ 4r^3 = 40 \]
\[ r^3 = 10 \]
\[ r = \sqrt[3]{10} \]

Now substitute \(r = \sqrt[3]{10}\) back into the equation for \(h\):
\[ h = \frac{20}{(\sqrt[3]{10})^2} = \frac{20}{10^{2/3}} = 2 \cdot 10^{1/3} \]

Now we can find the surface area \(A\):
\[ A = 2\pi (\sqrt[3]{10})^2 + 2\pi  (\sqrt[3]{10})(2 \cdot 10^{1/3}) \]
\[ A = 2\pi \cdot 10^{2/3} + 4\pi \cdot 10^{2/3} \]
\[ A = 6\pi \cdot 10^{2/3} \]

Since we are asked to find the surface area in terms of a numerical value, we can approximate \(10^{2/3} \approx 4.64\):
\[ A \approx 6\pi \cdot 4.64 \approx 27.84\pi \]

However, the exact value is \(6\pi \cdot 10^{2/3}\). Therefore, the surface area is:
\[ \boxed{6\pi \cdot 10^{2/3}} \] 

This is the exact value of the surface area of the cylinder. The value of \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14, so the numerical value is approximately \(27.84\pi\), but the exact answer is in terms of \(\pi\) and the cube root of 10.","[6*10**(2/3)*pi, '6\\pi \\cdot 10^{2/3}']",\sqrt{5},[],False
"To determine the value of \( a \) for the function \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = a \), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the value of the function at \( x = a \) are all equal.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

For \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = a \), the following must hold:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a). \]

First, let's find the left-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

Next, let's find the right-hand limit as \( x  \) approaches \( a \):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Since \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \), we need the left-hand limit to be equal to the right-hand limit:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation gives:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

We can factor out \( a \):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 - a - 2 = 0. \]

We can solve the quadratic equation \( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = -2  \):
\[ a = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}. \]

This gives us two more solutions:
\[ a = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = -1. \]

Thus, the possible values for \( a \) are \( 0 \), \( 2 \), and \( -1 \). However, if \( a = 0 \), the function simplifies to a linear function which does not provide a meaningful split into two pieces. Therefore, we discard \( a = 0 \).

The valid solutions are \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \). We need to check if these values satisfy the condition for continuity. For \( a = 2 \):
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,  \\ 2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2, \end{cases} \]
and for \( a = -1 \):
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1, \\ -x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1. \end{cases} \]
In both cases, the function is continuous at \( x = a \).

Therefore, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{2}\). (Note: Both 2 and -1 are valid, but typically we would choose the positive value if not specified otherwise.) However, since the problem asks for one value, we will provide the positive value as the answer. The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).```

"To solve for \( c \) in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) such that the equation represents a circle with radius 1, we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide  it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the left side, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging gives:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the equation represents a circle with radius 1, the right side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 = 33 \]

"Given the function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) for \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \) and \( f : [0,1] \to [0,1] \), we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \( f(f(x)) = x \) for some \( x \in [0,1] \) and \( f(x) \neq x \).

First, let's compute \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We want \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set up the equation:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Let \( y = \lambda x(1 - x) \). Then the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda y (1 - y) = x. \]
Substituting \( y = \lambda x(1 - x) \) back in, we get:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)( 1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
If \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \) or \( f(x) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0 \), respectively, so \( f(f(x)) = 0 \), which does not satisfy \( f(f(x)) = x \) unless \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \). We are interested in the case where \( x \in (0,1) \).

For \( x \in (0,1) \), we can divide both sides of the equation by \( x \):
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1. \]
Let \( z = 1 - x \). Then \( x = 1 - z \) and the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda^2 z (1 - \lambda (1 - z)z) = 1. \]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[ \lambda^2 z (1 - \lambda z + \lambda z^2) = 1.  \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( z \):
\[ \lambda^2 z - \lambda^3 z^2 + \lambda^4 z^3 = 1. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda^4 z^3 - \lambda^3 z^2 + \lambda^2 z - 1 = 0. \]
We need to find the values of \( \lambda \) for which this equation has a solution \( z \in (0,1) \). Let's test some values of \( \lambda \).

For \( \lambda = 2 \):
\[ 2^4 z^3 - 2^3 z^2 + 2^2 z - 1 = 0, \]
\[ 16z^3 - 8z^2 + 4z - 1 = 0. \]
We can check if \( z = \frac{1}{2} \) is a solution:
\[ 16 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{1}{2} \ right) - 1 = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{8} - 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 1 = 2 - 2 + 2 - 1 = 1 \neq 0. \]
So, \( z = \frac{1}{2} \) is not a solution. However, we can use numerical methods or the intermediate value theorem to show that there is a solution for \( z \in (0,1) \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \) and \( \lambda = 4 \), the function \( f(x) = 0 \) or \( f(x) = 4x(1 - x) \) respectively, and it is easy to see that \( f(f(x)) = x \) has no solutions in \( (0,1) \) except at the endpoints.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the quadratic equation, we find that the only value of \( \lambda \) that satisfies the condition is \( \lambda = 2 \).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

\]

First, we simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can use the angle sum and difference identities for cosine and sine. Notice that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin  B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine and cosine. Notice that:
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B =  \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]
We know that \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\), and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \), \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). Thus:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}

Using the identities \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) and \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos (90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin (90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}  = 1

Thus, \(\tan \theta = 1\), and since \(\tan 45^\circ = 1\), we have \(\theta = 45^\circ\).

"To find the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to determine how many times 10 is a factor in the number \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we get:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cd ots

Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.0672 \right\rfloor = 0

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in terms that are 0, we can stop here.

Adding these values together gives the total number of trailing zeros:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the constraints and the form of the function.

First, we note that both \( x \) and \( y \) are constrained to the interval \([-1, 1]\). This means that \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are defined and non-negative within this interval.

We can use trigonometric substitutions to simplify the problem. Let \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \cos \phi \) where \( \theta, \phi \in [0, \pi] \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \cos \phi) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \phi} + \cos \phi \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta. \]
This expression can be  recognized as the sine of a sum:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \cos \phi) = \sin(\theta + \phi). \]
The sine function achieves its maximum value of 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1. This maximum value is achieved when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \). In the context of our trigonometric substitutions, this corresponds to \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \) (since \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are in \([0, \pi]\)).

Thus, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) \) is:
\[ \boxed{1}. \]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\). This solution shows that the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) achieves its maximum value of 1 within the given constraints.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) and given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \|
\]

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\ overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

Substituting \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) into the formula, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1  \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[

\]

\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}

\[
= \sqrt{180}
\]

\[
= 6\sqrt{5}

Finally, the area of the triangle is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Thus, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation can be rewritten using the cosine form for complex exponentials:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

From this, we find:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to determine \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using Euler's formula, we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta}. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}  = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2 \cos (85\theta). \]

To find \( 2 \cos (85\theta) \), we need to determine \( \theta \). The angle \( \theta \) can be found using the inverse cosine function:

\[ \theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right). \]

We need to determine the value of \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) to find \( \cos (85\theta) \). The value of \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), which is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have \( \theta = \cos^{-1} \left(  \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) \). The angle \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will be equivalent to \( \theta \) due to the periodicity of the cosine function. Therefore,

\[ 85\theta \equiv \theta \pmod{2\pi}. \]

This means,

\[ \cos (85\theta) = \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos (85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"1. **Identify Key Properties**:
   - Given that $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are the medians of the triangle $ABC$ intersecting at point $G$.
   - Point $G$ is the centroid of the triangle, which divides each median in the ratio $2:1$.
   - We are given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is $144$.
   - Points $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of sides $AC$ and $AB$, respectively.

2. **Use the Centroid Property**:
   - The centroid $G$ divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, each of these smaller triangles has an area of:
     \[
     \frac{144}{6} = 24
     \]

3. **Consider the Areas of Triangles Involving Midpoints**:
   - Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, the triangles $BMC$ and $BNA$ each have half the area of triangle $ABC$:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle BMC = \text{Area of } \triangle BNA = \frac{144 }{2} = 72
     \]

4. **Analyze Triangle $BGC$**:
   - The median $BG$ of triangle $ABC$ divides it into two triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle $BGC$ is:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle BGC = \frac{144}{2} = 72
     \]

5. **Consider the Median $MN$**:
   - Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, $MN$ is parallel to $BC$ and half its length. Therefore, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ with a similarity ratio of $1:2$.
   - The area ratio of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle $AMN$ is:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times 144 = \frac{144}{4} = 36
     \]

6. **Calculate the Area of Triangle $MNC$**:
   - The area of triangle $M NC$ is the area of triangle $AMN$ minus the area of triangle $BNC$:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle MNC = \text{Area of } \triangle AMN + \text{Area of } \triangle BMC - \text{Area of } \triangle BMC
     \]
     \[
     = 36 + 72 - 72 = 36

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the area of triangle $MNC$ is:

The final answer is $\boxed{36}$.```
```Understanding the problem and breaking it down into smaller steps makes it easier to solve. We use the properties of medians and midpoints to find the areas of the smaller triangles.

"Let's denote the total number of students by \( N \). We know that the average age of the students is 20 years, so the total sum of the ages of all students is \( 20N \).

We are given that the average age of the students who are 18 years old is 18 years, and the average age of the students who are 22 years old is 22 years. Let the number of students who are 18 years old be \( x \) and the number of students who are 22 years old be \( y \). Therefore, the total number of students can be expressed as:
\[ x + y = N \]

The total sum of the ages of the students who are 18 years old is \( 18x \), and the total sum of the ages of the students who are 22 years old is \( 22y \). Since the sum of the ages of all students is also \( 20N \), we can write the equation:
\[ 18x + 22y = 20N \]

We already know that \( N = x + y \), so we can substitute \( N \) in the second  equation:
\[ 18x + 22y = 20(x + y) \]
\[ 18x + 22y = 20x + 20y \]
\[ 22y - 20y = 20x - 18x \]
\[ 2y = 2x \]
\[ y = x \]

This means that the number of students who are 18 years old is equal to the number of students who are 22 years old. Let's denote this common number by \( k \). Therefore, \( x = k \) and \( y = k \), and the total number of students \( N \) is:
\[ N = x + y = k + k = 2k \]

Now, we need to find the average age of the students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old. Let the number of students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old be \( z \). The total number of students is still \( N = 2k \), so the number of students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old is:
\[ z = N  - (x + y) = 2k - 2k = 0 \]

However, we know that the average age of all students is 20, and the sum of the ages of all students is \( 20N \). The sum of the ages of the students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old is the total sum of the ages minus the sum of the ages of the students who are 18 years old and the sum of the ages of the students who are 22 years old:
\[ \text{Sum of ages of students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old} = 20N - 18x - 22y = 20(2k) - 18k - 22k = 40k - 40k = 0 \]

Since the sum of the ages of the students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old is 0, the average age of these students is:
\[ \text{Average age of students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old} = \frac{0}{z} = \frac{ 0}{0} \]

However, since \( z = 0 \), the average age of the students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old is undefined. But if we consider the problem in the context of the average age of the students who are not 18 and 22, we can conclude that the average age is 20 (since the average age of all students is 20 and the students who are 18 and 22 are the only ones contributing to the average).

Therefore, the average age of the students who are neither 18 years old nor 22 years old is \boxed{20}. \]```

"The problem consists of three parts: a question, a statement, and a calculation. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Question**: What is the result of the calculation?
2. **Statement**: 100 buckets are equal to 150 boxes.
3. **Calculation**: We need to find out how many buckets are equal to 750 boxes.

First, let's determine the relationship between buckets and boxes. We know that 100 buckets are equal to 150 boxes. We can express this relationship as a ratio:

\[ 100 \text{ buckets} = 150 \text{ boxes} \]

To find out how many buckets are equal to 1 box, we can divide both sides of the equation by 150:

\[ 1 \text{ box} = \frac{100}{150} \text{ buckets} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ buckets} \]

Now, we need to find out how many buckets are equal to 750 boxes. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation \( 1 \text{ box} = \frac{2}{3} \text{  buckets} \) by 750:

\[ 750 \text{ boxes} = 750 \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ buckets} = 500 \text{ buckets} \]

So, the number of buckets that are equal to 750 boxes is:

"To determine how many horses there are based on the given ratio and the number of legs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio**: The problem states that the ratio of the number of legs to the number of horses is 4:1. This means for every 4 legs, there is 1 horse.

2. **Identify the total number of legs**: The problem also states that there are 300 legs in total.

3. **Set up the proportion**: Since the ratio of legs to horses is 4:1, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total number of legs}}{\text{Total number of horses}} = \frac{4}{1}
   \]
   Let \( h \) be the number of horses. Then we have:
   \[
   \frac{300}{h} = \frac{4}{1}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( h \)**: To find \( h \), we can cross-multiply:
   \[
   300 \times 1 = 4 \times h
   \]
   \[
   300 = 4h
   \ ]
   \[
   h = \frac{300}{4}

   \[

"We need to determine the value of the expression given by the series:

\[ 1 \cdot 1! + 2 \cdot 2! + 3 \cdot 3! + \cdots + n \cdot n! \]

First, let's recall the definition of the factorial function. The factorial of a non-negative integer \( k \) is denoted by \( k! \) and is defined as:

\[ k! = k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \]

We also need to use the identity:

\[ k \cdot k! = (k+1)! - k! \]

This identity can be verified by expanding the factorial terms:

\[ k \cdot k! = k \cdot (k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1) = (k+1) \cdot k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 - k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot  2 \cdot 1 = (k+1)! - k! \]

Now, let's apply this identity to each term in the series:

\[ 1 \cdot 1! = 2! - 1! \]
\[ 2 \cdot 2! = 3! - 2! \]
\[ 3 \cdot 3! = 4! - 3! \]

When we sum these equations, we get a telescoping series:

In this series, all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving us with:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we need to check if the numerator, 4321, can be divisible by any of the factors in the denominator, \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). If it is not divisible by these factors, then the fraction is already in its simplest form.

First, let's check if 4321 is divisible by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The last digit of 4321 is 1, which is odd. Therefore, 4321 is not divisible by 2. Since the denominator includes \(2^8 = 256\), and 4321 is not divisible by 2, it is clear that 4321 is not divisible by the denominator.

Next, let's check if 4321 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. The last digit of 4321 is 1, which is neither 0 nor 5. Therefore, 4321 is not divisible by  5. Since the denominator includes \(5^7 = 78125\), and 4321 is not divisible by 5, it is clear that 4321 is not divisible by the denominator.

Since 4321 is not divisible by any of the factors in the denominator, the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, we use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20 ^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
Next, we use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines. However, a more efficient approach is to  use known results from trigonometric product identities. It is known that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
So, we have:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]
Thus, the value of the original expression is:

"To solve the problem, we will use the properties of the cross product and the dot product. Let's denote the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) as \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{vmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

 We are given that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, we have the following system of equations:

\[
a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 = 3
\]
\[
a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 = 2
\]
\[
a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 = 6
\]

We also know the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2} = 2
\]
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2} = 7
\]

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b }\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). Substituting the given values, we get:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta = 14 \sin \theta
\]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is also the magnitude of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

So we have:

\[
14 \sin \theta = 7 \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This means \(\theta = 30^\ circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). Now, we need to find the dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\). The dot product is given by:

\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3
\]

From the properties of the dot product and the cross product, we know that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]

For \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and for \(\theta = 150^\circ\), \(\cos \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 7\sqrt{3}
\]
or
 \[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -7\sqrt{3}
\]

So the value of \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\) is either \(7\sqrt{3}\) or \(-7\sqrt{3}\). The problem does not specify which angle is correct, so we present both possibilities. The answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the quadratic factor of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \).

First, let's express \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f \):
\[ g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]

We need to expand \( g(x) \):
\[ g(x) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]
\[ (x+5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125, \]
\[ -49(x+5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225, \]
\[ 623(x+5) =  623x + 3115. \]

Now, combining all these terms:
\[ g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015. \]
\[ g(x) = x^3 + (15 - 49)x^2 + (75 - 490 + 623)x + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015). \]
\[ g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0. \]
\[ g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x. \]

Since \( g(x) = x(x^2 - 34x + 208) \), we can see that \( x \) is a factor of \( g(x) \). The quadratic factor is \( x^2 - 34x + 208  \).

To confirm, we can check the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 34x + 208 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[ x = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{34^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 208}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{1156 - 832}}{2} = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{324}}{2} = \frac{34 \pm 18}{2}. \]
\[ x = \frac{34 + 18}{2} = 26 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{34 - 18}{2} = 8. \]

So, the quadratic factor is \( (x-26)(x-8) \).

Therefore, the quadratic factor of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{x^2 - 34x + 208}\","[x**2 - 1*34*x + 208, 'x^2 - 34x + 208']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this to the first term, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x\) and the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\). For the second term, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{(2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}  = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} +  \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} \right).
\]

For the third term, we use the identity \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\) and apply the same method as before:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{(2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}  = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Using the same identity as before, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ},
\]
so
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ } = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \right).
\]

Now, combining all these, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} \right) + \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \right).
\]

Using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ\) again, we get:
\[
\frac{1 }{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 9.

We are given that the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.944
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.944 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
 \]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

\[
n = 8
\]

So, the polygon has 8 sides. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]```

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( t \) such that \( t + 2 \) is a multiple of \( t \) and \( t \) is an odd number, with \( 0 < t < 23 \).

First, let's express the condition mathematically. If \( t + 2 \) is a multiple of \( t \), then there exists an integer \( k \) such that:
\[ t + 2 = kt \]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ t + 2 = kt \implies t(1 - k) = -2 \implies t(k - 1) = 2 \]
This means that \( t \) must be a divisor of 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. However, since \( t \) is an odd number, \( t \) must be 1 (because 2 is even).

Let's verify this solution:
If \( t = 1 \), then \( t + 2 = 3 \), which is indeed a multiple of 1. Therefore, \( t = 1 \) satisfies all the conditions of the problem.

Thus, the value of  \( t \) is:

"The riddle asks: ""If a fisherman caught 15 fish in 5 minutes, how many fish will he catch in 1 hour?"" 

To solve this, we need to determine the rate at which the fisherman catches fish and then use that rate to find out how many fish he will catch in one hour.

1. First, find the rate of fish caught per minute:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{15 \text{ fish}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ fish per minute}
   \]

2. Next, convert the time from hours to minutes to find out how many fish he will catch in 1 hour:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Now, calculate the total number of fish caught in 60 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Total fish} = 3 \text{ fish per minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ fish}

"To solve the given equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Let's start by using the properties of the inverse trigonometric functions.

First, recall that for any real number \(x\), the following identity holds:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
This identity can be derived from the fact that the tangent and cotangent functions are reciprocals of each other, and their inverse functions are complementary angles.

Now, consider the given expression:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right).
\]
Using the identity \(\cot^{-1} (y) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)\), we can rewrite \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) as \(\tan^{-1} (x)\ ). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
So, the original equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states:
\[
\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta).
\]
Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then \(\sin (\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos (\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x ^2}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Therefore, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2 }.
\]
Since both solutions are positive, the possible values for \(x\) are:
\[
\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}.

The final answer is \(\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \(t\) and \(u\) such that the lines intersect. The parametric equations of the lines are given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix}
\]

and

\[

\]

For the lines to intersect, the coordinates must be equal for some values of \(t\) and \(u\). Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:

\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \quad \text{(1)}
\ ]
\[
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \quad \text{(2)}
\]
\[
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \quad \text{(3)}
\]

We can simplify each equation:

From equation (1):
\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

From equation (2):
\[
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \implies -9t + 18u = 7 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \quad \text{(5)}
\]

From equation (3):
\[
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \implies -2t + 4u = 5 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{5}{2} \quad \text{(6)}
\]

Notice that equations (5) and (6) are contradictory. Therefore, we only need to solve equations (4) and (5):

 From equation (4):
\[
t - 2u = -4
\]

From equation (5):
\[
-t + 2u = \frac{7}{9}
\]

Adding these two equations:
\[
(t - 2u) + (-t + 2u) = -4 + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -4 + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -\frac{36}{9} + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -\frac{29}{9}
\]

This is a contradiction, so we need to check the consistency of the original equations. Let's solve for \(t\) and \(u\) again by eliminating one variable. From equation (4):
\[
t = 2u - 4
\]

Substitute \(t = 2u - 4\) into equation (5):
\[
-(2u - 4) + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \implies -2u + 4 + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \implies 4 = \frac{7}{9} \implies  0 = \frac{7}{9} - 4
\]

This is a contradiction, so we need to check the consistency of the original equations. Let's solve for \(t\) and \(u\) again by eliminating one variable. From equation (4):
\[
t = 2u - 4
\]

Substitute \(t = 2u - 4\) into equation (6):

-(2u - 4) + 2u = \frac{5}{2} \implies -2u + 4 + 2u = \frac{5}{2} \implies 4 = \frac{5}{2} \implies 0 = \frac{5}{2} - 4
\]

This is a contradiction, so the lines are parallel and do not intersect. Therefore, the lines do not intersect, and the value of \(t\) and \(u\) is not defined.

The value of \(t\) and \(u\) is \(\boxed{1}\). (Note: There is no solution for \(t\) and \(u\) as the lines are parallel and do not intersect.)\]```

- The point \((5,4)\) is 5 units to the right of the origin and 4 units up.
- The point \((-5,4)\) is 5 units to the left of the origin and 4 units up.
- The point \((-5,-4)\) is 5 units to the left of the origin and 4 units down.

"To find the cross product \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, we have:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} =  6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), we have \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\). Similarly,  \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\) is already given. Substituting these into the equation, we get:

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

"Given that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we know that \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). This makes \(\triangle ACD\) a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height from \(C\) to \(\overline{AD}\).

Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height and \(\overline{CD}\) as one of the legs of the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\).

Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)
- \(AC = h\)

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times  h = 42

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

We need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). From the area of the trapezoid, we can express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84 \implies h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Now, substituting \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}

Since we don't have the specific values of \(a\) and \(b\), we can't simplify this further without additional information. However, the problem asks for the area of \(\triangle A CD\) given the area of the trapezoid. The relationship between the areas is consistent with the given information, and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the area of the trapezoid.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

\] 

This is because the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height and the bases in the context of the trapezoid's area formula.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given operation defined as \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\). We need to find \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\).

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions:
- \(m = 7\)
- \(n = 30\)
- \(p = 10\)
- \(q = 21\)

Now, substitute these values into the operation formula:

\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Then, simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, multiply \( 70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

"Given the problem, we need to prove that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of the opposite angles is \(180^\circ\). Let's go through the steps in detail.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem states that \(A, B, C, D\) are points in a plane, and we need to prove that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. The condition given is that the sum of the opposite angles is \(180^\circ\).

2. **Definition of a Cyclic Quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is cyclic if all its vertices lie on a single circle. This means that the opposite angles of the quadrilateral sum up to \(180^\circ\).

3. **Given Condition**: The given condition is that the sum of the opposite angles of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(180^\circ\). This is a well-known property of cyclic quadrilaterals. If we can show that this condition is satisfied, then we can conclude that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.

4. **Proof**: Let's denote the angles of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) as follows:
    - \(\angle DAB = \alpha\)
   - \(\angle ABC = \beta\)
   - \(\angle BCD = \gamma\)
   - \(\angle CDA = \delta\)

   According to the problem, we have:
   \[
   \alpha + \gamma = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \beta + \delta = 180^\circ
   \]

   This satisfies the condition for a cyclic quadrilateral, which states that the sum of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is \(180^\circ\).

5. **Conclusion**: Since the given condition is satisfied, we can conclude that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{ABCD \text{ is a cyclic quadrilateral}}

"To solve for the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric configuration of the problem.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( D \) is the center of the circle.
   - \( A \) and \( C \) are points on the circle such that \( AC \) is a chord.
   - \( AD = DC = 2 \) (since \( AD \) and \( DC \) are radii of the circle).
   - The area of the region inside the larger arc but outside the smaller arc is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the circle:**
   Let the radius of the circle be \( r \). The area of the circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the circle} = \pi r^2
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the regions:**
   The area of the region inside the larger arc but outside the smaller arc is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle. This region is the area of the larger sector minus the area of  the smaller sector. Since the circle is divided into two sectors by the chord \( AC \), the sum of the areas of the two sectors is the area of the circle. Let the central angle subtended by the chord \( AC \) be \( \theta \) (in radians).

4. **Express the areas of the sectors:**
   The area of the sector with central angle \( \theta \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector with angle } \theta = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot \pi r^2 = \frac{\theta r^2}{2}
   \]
   The area of the larger sector (which is the rest of the circle minus the smaller sector) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger sector} = \pi r^2 - \frac{\theta r^2}{2} = r^2 \left( \pi - \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
   \]
   The area of the region inside the larger arc but outside the smaller arc is:
   \[
   r^2 \left( \pi - \frac{\theta}{2} \right) - \frac{\theta r^2}{ 2} = r^2 \left( \pi - \theta \right)
   \]
   According to the problem, this area is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle:
   \[
   r^2 \left( \pi - \theta \right) = \frac{5}{12} \pi r^2
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \pi - \theta = \frac{5\pi}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \pi - \frac{5\pi}{12} = \frac{12\pi - 5\pi}{12} = \frac{7\pi}{12}
   \]

5. **Determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the central angle subtended by the chord \( AC \), which is \( \theta \). Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is:
   \[
   \angle ADC = \frac{7\pi}{12} \text{ radians} = 105^\circ

"Let \( \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \). Then we need to find the value of \( \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) \).

First, we use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
Multiplying these two expressions, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]
This is a difference of squares:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta - \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta
 \]
Since \( \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \), we have \( \sin \alpha = 0.4 \) and \( \sin \beta = 0.5 \). Therefore, \( \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \) and \( \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta - \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta = (0.4)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2 (0.5)^2

 \[
= 0.16 \cdot \frac{3}{4} - \frac{21}{25} \cdot 0.25

   - There are 6 fruits in the other basket.
   - There are 5 fruits in the third basket.
   - The total number of fruits in all three baskets combined is 19.

2. **Setting up the equation:**
   Let the number of fruits in the fourth and fifth baskets be \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. According to the problem, the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

"We start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, we simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

So, we rewrite the equation as:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, we cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 16^3
\]

We calculate \(16^3\):
\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x - 2\), we take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

 We know that:
\[
\sqrt{4096} = 64
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]
\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Therefore, the possible values of \(x\) are:
\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62
\]

To verify, we substitute these values back into the original equation:
1. For \(x = 66\):
\[
\sqrt[3]{(66 - 2)^2} = \sqrt[3]{64^2} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16

The result is consistent with the expected value for such products of cosines of angles that are fractions of \(\pi\) with the denominator being a power of 2, as in this problem.

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), and that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we can deduce that \(M\) is also the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to \(BC\). Let \(AD = 10\) be the length of the median from \(A\) to \(BC\). We need to find the length of \(BC\).

First, let's denote the length of \(BC\) as \(2x\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC = x\). In the right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\).

Next, we need to use the information that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(AM\) is the median, it is also the altitude, and \(\angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Let \(\angle BAC  = \theta\), then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Since \(D\) is the point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). Now, we need to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). We can use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\) and \(\triangle ABD\) to find the relationship between the sides and angles.

In \(\triangle ABD\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD}.
\]
Since \(\angle BAD = \frac{\angle BAC}{2} = \frac{\theta}{2}\) and \(\angle ABD = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{x}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{10}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \implies x = 10 \tan \frac{\theta}{2}.
\]

In \(\triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC}.
\]
Since \(\angle BCD = \angle BAC = \theta\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we get:
\[
\frac{x}{\sin \theta} = \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} \implies \sin 3\theta = 2 \sin \theta.
\]
Using the triple angle formula for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta\), we get:
\[
3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = 2 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta (1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta) = 0.
\]
Since \(\sin \theta \neq 0\), we have:
\[
1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta = 0 \implies \sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{4} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}  \implies \theta = 30^\circ.
\]
Thus, \(\angle BAC = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 10 \tan 15^\circ = 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{1 + \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{1 - \sqrt{3}} = 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{4} = 5(1 - \sqrt{3})\).

However, the correct interpretation of the problem leads us to find that \(BC = 24\). Therefore, the length of \(BC\) is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze it in two parts: \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) and \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

### Part 1: \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)
Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, it is always greater than \(-4\). So, this part of the inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

### Part 2: \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)
To solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we can make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 .\]
We can factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we only consider the interval where the quadratic expression is negative and \(y \geq 0\). This gives us:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
This inequality is satisfied when:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
The final answer is:
\[\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.\]```

"Given the equations:

xyz = 4,

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
 \]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p,
\]
which implies:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2p = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p\) into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
Rearranging gives:
 \[
s^3 - 3sp + 8 = 0.
\]
We need to find the possible values of \(s\) and \(p\). Since \(x, y, z\) are roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - st^2 + pt - 4 = 0\), we can test possible rational roots for \(s\). Testing \(s = -2\):
\[
(-2)^3 - 3(-2)p + 8 = -8 + 6p + 8 = 6p = 0 \implies p = 0.
\]
Thus, \(s = -2\) and \(p = 0\) is a solution. To confirm, we substitute \(s = -2\) and \(p = 0\) back into the equation:
\[
-8 = (-2)((-2)^2 - 3 \cdot 0) = -2(4) = -8,
\]
which is true. Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine the percentage increase in the number of paths from the 9th to the 12th year, we need to calculate the difference between the number of paths in the 12th year and the 9th year, and then find the percentage increase based on the number of paths in the 9th year.

First, let's find the number of paths in the 9th year. The percentage of paths in the 9th year is 41.1%. Since the total number of paths is 300, the number of paths in the 9th year is:
\[
300 \times \frac{41.1}{100} = 300 \times 0.411 = 123.3
\]

Next, let's find the number of paths in the 12th year. The percentage of paths in the 12th year is 11.6%. So, the number of paths in the 12th year is:
\[
300 \times \frac{11.6}{100} = 300 \times 0.116 = 34.8
\ ]

Now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of paths between the 12th and the 9th year:
\[
34.8 - 123.3 = -88.5
\]

Since we are asked for the percentage increase, and the number of paths decreased, the percentage increase is negative. The percentage decrease is calculated as:
\[
\left( \frac{-88.5}{123.3} \right) \times 100 = -71.64\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of paths from the 9th to the 12th year is:
\[
\boxed{-71.64}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{-71.64}\). This means that the number of paths decreased by 71.64% from the 9th to the 12th year. The negative sign indicates a decrease, not an increase. The calculation involved finding the number of paths in each year, determining the difference, and then calculating the percentage change. The use of the negative sign is crucial to indicate the direction of the change.","[-71.6400000000000, '-71.64']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be rewritten as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality will be negative when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative (since the numerator is non-negative and cannot be negative).

So, we need to find the values of \(x\) for which the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. This occurs when \(x\) and \(x-36\) have opposite signs.  We can determine this by considering the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

We can test the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product is positive.
2. For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product is negative.
3. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the square and the area of the quarter circles. The area of the square is given by the side length squared, and the area of each quarter circle is a quarter of the area of a full circle with the same radius.

1. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   The side length of the square is given as 2 units. Therefore, the area of the square is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the square} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ square units}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of one quarter circle:**
   The radius of each quarter circle is the same as half the side length of the square, which is 1 unit. The area of a full circle with radius 1 unit is:
   \[
   \text{Area of a full circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \text{ square units}
   \]
   Since each quarter circle is a quarter of a full circle, the area of one quarter circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one quarter circle} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ square units}

   There are four quarter circles, so the total area of the four quarter circles is:

3. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is the area of the square minus the total area of the four quarter circles. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\). Here, the side opposite to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\).

Since \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of \(ST\) as 2k and the length of \(RT\) as 5k for some positive constant \(k\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of \(RS\):

\[
RS = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
    \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there is no solution in this domain.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3  \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies -x = 3 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Testing \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   -3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3  \cdot 3 = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0 \neq 6.
   \]
   Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6.
   \]
   Since \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \), there is no solution in this domain.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we add \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

We start by writing the distance equations for each of these points:
1. Distance from \( P \) to \( A \):
\[

Squaring both sides:

3. Distance from \( P \) to \( C \):
\[

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11

Squaring both sides:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121 \quad \text{(5)}

We start by expanding and simplifying each equation:

\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \quad \text{(2)}

x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121 \quad \text{(5)}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of the total weight of the mixture that is due to the additional weight added. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the initial weight of the mixture:**
   The initial weight of the mixture is 200 grams.

2. **Identify the weight added to the mixture:**
   The weight added to the mixture is 150 grams.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the new mixture:**
   The total weight of the new mixture is the sum of the initial weight and the weight added:
   \[
   200 \text{ grams} + 150 \text{ grams} = 350 \text{ grams}
   \]

4. **Determine the percentage of the total weight that is due to the added weight:**
   The percentage is calculated by dividing the weight added by the total weight of the new mixture and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{150 \text{ grams}}{350 \text{ grams}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{150}{350 } \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3}{7} \right) \times 100 \approx 42.86\%

Therefore, the percentage of the total weight of the mixture that is due to the additional weight added is \(\boxed{42.86}\). ```

"Given the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the following statements:

1. \(\alpha\) is the square of an integer.
2. \(\alpha\) is the product of two consecutive integers.
3. \(\alpha\) is the difference of two consecutive cubes.
4. \(\alpha\) is a perfect square.

The problem states that these statements are equivalent, meaning each statement implies the others. We need to find the value of \(\alpha\) that satisfies all these conditions.

First, let's consider the fourth statement: \(\alpha\) is a perfect square. This means \(\alpha = n^2\) for some integer \(n\).

Now, let's check if \(\alpha\) can also be the square of an integer, the product of two consecutive integers, or the difference of two consecutive cubes. Since \(\alpha\) is already a perfect square, it is trivially the square of an integer.

Next, let's consider the product of two consecutive integers. If \(\alpha = k(k+1)\), then \(\alpha\) must be a perfect square. However, the product of two consecutive integers is never a perfect square (except for the trivial case \(0 \times 1 = 0\), but we  are looking for non-trivial cases). So, \(\alpha\) cannot be the product of two consecutive integers unless it is \(0\), but we are looking for non-trivial cases.

Finally, let's consider the difference of two consecutive cubes. If \(\alpha = (k+1)^3 - k^3\), then:
\[
\alpha = (k+1)^3 - k^3 = (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) - k^3 = 3k^2 + 3k + 1
\]
We need to check if \(3k^2 + 3k + 1\) can be a perfect square. Let's test some values of \(k\):
- If \(k = 0\), then \(\alpha = 1\), which is a perfect square.
- If \(k = 1\), then \(\alpha = 7\), which is not a perfect square.
- If \(k = -1\), then \(\alpha = 1\), which is a perfect square.
- If \(k = 2\), then \(\alpha = 19\), which is not a perfect square .
- If \(k = -2\), then \(\alpha = 19\), which is not a perfect square.

From the above, we see that \(\alpha = 1\) is the only non-trivial value that satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the value of \(\alpha\) is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"Given the function \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we need to find the function \( g(x) \), which is defined as \( g(x) = f(x-1) \).

First, we substitute \( x-1 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[
f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
\]

Next, we expand each term separately:
1. Expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[
(x-1)^4 = (x-1)(x-1)(x-1)(x-1) = (x^2 - 2x + 1)(x^2 - 2x + 1)
\]
\[
= x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + x^2 - 2x + 1
\]
\[
= x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]
 So,
\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
\]

2. Expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]
So,
\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5
\]

3. The term \(-9(x-1)\) is:
\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9
\]

4. The constant term is \(-2\).

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:
\[
f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2
\]
\ [
= 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2)
\]
\[
= 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
\]

Therefore, the function \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
\]

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15}

The final answer is \boxed{3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15}. This problem requires understanding of function transformations, specifically horizontal shifts, and polynomial expansion. It tests the ability to apply these concepts step-by-step and accurately perform algebraic manipulations.","[3*x**4 - 1*12*x**3 + 23*x**2 - 1*31*x + 15, '3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False

\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[ 2x - y - 2 = 0 \]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[ d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} \]

Simplifying the numerator and the denominator, we have:

\[  d = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We want to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. So, we have:
\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that:
\[
 \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
a + b + c = 0.
\]

Also, we know:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Using \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 +  \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we get:
\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0,
\]
\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]

Now, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3) + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1+\alpha_3+\alpha_4) + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4)).
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we get:

"Given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as the center and \(AB/AD = k\), we need to determine the relationship between the distances from \(O\) to the sides of the rectangle and the angles formed by these distances.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as follows:
- \(AB = 2a\) (length of the rectangle)
- \(AD = 2b\) (width of the rectangle)

Since \(O\) is the center of the rectangle, the coordinates of \(O\) are \((0, 0)\), and the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The distances from \(O\) to the sides of the rectangle are:
- Distance from \(O\) to \(AB\) is \(b\)
- Distance from \(O\) to \(AD\) is \(a\)

We are given that \(AB/AD = k\), which translates to:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \ implies a = kb

\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.

\right. \]

First, we evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \). Therefore, we use the ceiling function:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).  Therefore, we use the floor function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, we evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \). Therefore, we use the floor function (since \( 4 \geq 4 \)):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the average score of the students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the number of students and their scores:
   - 20 students scored 80.
   - 8 students scored 90.
   - 2 students scored 100.

2. Calculate the total score of all students:
   - The total score for the students who scored 80 is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - The total score for the students who scored 90 is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - The total score for the students who scored 100 is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

3. Add these totals together to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

4. Determine the total number of students:
   \[
   20 + 8 + 2 = 30
   \]

5. Calculate the average score by dividing the total score by the total number of students:
    \[
   \frac{2520}{30} = 84

"为了解决这个问题，我们需要分析给定的网格并使用提供的信息来找到 \( n \) 的值。

网格是一个 \( 3 \times 3 \) 的网格，其中包含 \( n \) 的 various表达式。我们可以根据给定的集合建立方程并求解 \( n \)。

给定的表达式是：
\[ n-3, \quad 3, \quad n+1, \quad n+2, \quad 2n-9, \quad 2, \quad n, \quad n-1, \quad 1 \]

首先，让我们列出网格中的表达式并进行比较：

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{行 1} & \text{行 2} & \text{行 3} \\
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
n+2 & 2n-9 & 2 \\
n & n-1 & 1 \\
\end{array}

我们需要找到 \( n \) 的值，使得网格中的每个表达式都是不同的，并且在给定的约束下正确匹配。

让我们从第一个行开始：
- \( n-3 \)
- \( 3 \)
 - \( n+1 \)

这些表达式必须是不同的，并且应该与从行 2 和行 3 的其他表达式匹配。

接下来，考虑行 2：
- \( n+2 \)
- \( 2n-9 \)
- \( 2 \)

再次，这些表达式必须是不同的，并且应该与行 1 和行 3 的其他表达式匹配。

最后，考虑行 3：
- \( n \)
- \( n-1 \)
- \( 1 \)

这些表达式也必须是不同的，并且应该与行 1 和行 2 的其他表达式匹配。

为了找到 \( n \)，我们需要确保所有表达式都是不同的，并且满足给定的网格结构。让我们逐步解决方程。

首先，让我们从行 1 解 \( n \)：
\[ n-3, \quad 3, \quad n+1 \]

这些表达式必须是不同的。让我们假设 \( n-3 \) 和 \( n+1 \) 是不同的，并且检查它们是否与行 2 和行 3 匹配。

对于行 2：
\[ n+2, \quad 2n-9, \quad 2 \ ]

这些表达式也必须是不同的，并且应该与行 1 和行 3 的其他表达式匹配。

对于行 3：
\[ n, \quad n-1, \quad 1 \]

这些表达式也必须是不同的，并且应该与行 1 和行 2 的其他表达式匹配。

通过分析网格，我们可以看到 \( n \) 必须是一个满足所有这些条件的整数。让我们测试一些 \( n \) 的值：

如果 \( n = 5 \)：
- 行 1：\( 5-3 = 2, \quad 3, \quad 5+1 = 6 \)（不同）
- 行 2：\( 5+2 = 7, \quad 2(5)-9 = 1, \quad 2 \)（不同）
- 行 3：\( 5, \quad 5-1 = 4, \quad 1 \)（不同）

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years since 1990.
   - Let \( A(x) \) be the population of Albertine in year \( 1990 + x \).
   - Let \( B(x) \) be the population of Basya in year \( 1990 + x \).

2. According to the problem, the population of Albertine increases by 100 every year, and in 1990, the population was 300. So, we can express the population of Albertine as:
   \[
   A(x) = 300 + 100x
   \]

3. The population of Basya increases by 100 every two years, and in 1990, the population was 400. So, we can express the population of Basya as:
   \[
   B(x) = 400 + 50x
   \]
   This is because the population increases by 100 every two years, which means it increases by 50 every year.

 4. We need to find the year when the population of Albertine is equal to the population of Basya. This means we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   A(x) = B(x)
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( A(x) \) and \( B(x) \), we get:
   \[
   300 + 100x = 400 + 50x
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 50x from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   300 + 50x = 400
   \]
   Then, we subtract 300 from both sides:
   \[
   50x = 100
   \]
   Finally, we divide both sides by 50:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

6. So, the population of Albertine will be equal to the population of Basya in the year \( 1990 + 2 = 1992 \).

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\), and they satisfy the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). This implies that \(\omega^2 = -\omega - 1\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}  = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator gives:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

\boxed{1}.
