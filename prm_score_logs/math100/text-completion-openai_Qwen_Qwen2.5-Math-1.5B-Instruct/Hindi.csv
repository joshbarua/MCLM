"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DE = x\) and \(DF = y\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, let's recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7\).

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\). adjoining the final answer to the box, we have:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\). This is the length of \(DE\). The problem is solved by recognizing the trigonometric relationship and solving the equation.","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To solve for \( w \) given that \( w \) is a rotation of \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians around \( c \), we start by expressing \( z \) and \( c \) in their given forms:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

First, we need to translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin. This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we rotate the translated point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians. The rotation of a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4}  \), we have:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i \ ]

Now, we need to translate this back by adding \( c \):
\[ w = 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]```

"$\sqrt{242}$ 的 simplify 的过程如下：

首先，我们找出 242 的因数。242 可以被分解为：

\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]

我们知道 121 是一个完全平方数，可以写成：

\[ 121 = 11^2 \]

因此，我们可以将 242 写成：

\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]

现在，我们可以将平方根号下的数进行分解：

\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} \]

根据平方根的性质，我们可以将平方根号 split 成两个部分：

\[ \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} \]

由于 $\sqrt{11^2} = 11$，我们可以简化为：

\[ \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

   The general term in the binomial expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by:
   \[
   T_{r+1} = \binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r
   \]
   For our expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

2. **Substitute the values into the general term formula:**
   \[
   T_{r+1} = \binom{5}{r} (10x^3)^{5-r} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^r

" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point and an angle from a fixed direction. The fixed point is called the pole, and the fixed direction is the polar axis.

In polar coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the pole and \(\theta\) is the angle from the polar axis. The angle \(\theta\) is typically measured in radians, and it is positive if measured counterclockwise from the polar axis.

To convert from Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we use the following formulas:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]
The formula for \(r\) is the same as the distance formula. The formula for \(\theta\) involves the arctangent function, but we need to be careful to determine the correct quadrant for \(\theta\) based on the signs of \(x\) and \(y\).

To convert from polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) to Cartesian  coordinates \((x, y)\), we use the following formulas:
\[
x = r \cos \theta
\]
\[
y = r \sin \theta
\]

Let's summarize the steps to convert between Cartesian and polar coordinates:
1. To convert from Cartesian to polar:
   - Calculate \(r\) using \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\), and adjust for the correct quadrant based on the signs of \(x\) and \(y\).
2. To convert from polar to Cartesian:
   - Calculate \(x\) using \(x = r \cos \theta\).
   - Calculate \(y\) using \(y = r \sin \theta\).

Here is an example to illustrate the conversion:
- Suppose we have a point in Cartesian coordinates \((3, 4)\).
  - To convert to polar coordinates:
    \[
    r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
    \]
    \[
    \theta = \tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.927 \text{ radians} \quad (\text{which is in the first quadrant})
    \]
    So the polar coordinates are \((5, 0.927)\).

- Now, let's convert the point \((5, 0.927)\) from polar to Cartesian coordinates:
  \[
  x = 5 \cos(0.927) \approx 3
  \]
  \[
  y = 5 \sin(0.927) \approx 4
  \]
  So the Cartesian coordinates are \((3, 4)\), which matches our original point.

The final answer is \(\boxed{(r, \theta)}\). This represents the polar coordinates of a point, where \(r\) is the radial distance and \(\theta\) is the angle from the polar axis. The specific values of \(r\) and \(\theta\) will depend on the point being converted. In this example, we converted the Cartesian coordinates \((3, 4)\) to the polar coordinates \((5, 0.927)\).","[Interval.open(r, theta), '(r, \\theta)']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"1. **Identify the given vertices of the triangle:** The vertices of the triangle are \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\).

2. **Determine the range for \(x\):** We are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, any point \((x, y)\) we find must have \(x > 7\).

3. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):**
   - The slope \(m\) of the line is given by:
     \[
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), we substitute \(m = 5\) and \((x_1, y_1) = (5, 3)\):
     \[
     y - 3 = 5(x - 5)
      \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     y - 3 = 5x - 25
     \]
     \[
     y = 5x - 22

4. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):**
   - The slope \(m\) of the line is given by:
     \[
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{4 - 3}{7 - 5} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), we substitute \(m = \frac{1}{2}\) and \((x_1, y_1) = (5, 3)\):
     \[
     y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 5)
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2 }
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2} + 3
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
     \]

5. **Find the equation of the line passing through \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):**
   - The slope \(m\) of the line is given by:
     \[
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = \frac{-4}{1} = -4
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), we substitute \(m = -4\) and \((x_1, y_1) = (6, 8)\):
     \[
     y - 8 = -4(x - 6)

     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     y - 8 = -4x + 24

      \[
     y = -4x + 24 + 8
     \]
     \[
     y = -4x + 32

6. **Find the intersection points:**
   - Intersection of \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = -4x + 32\):
     \[
     5x - 22 = -4x + 32
     \]
     \[
     5x + 4x = 32 + 22
     \]
     \[
     9x = 54
     \]
     \[
     x = 6
     \]
     Substituting \(x = 6\) into \(y = 5x - 22\):
     \[
     y = 5(6) - 22 = 30 - 22 = 8
     \]
     So, one intersection point is \((6, 8)\).

   - Intersection of \(y = 5x - 22\) and \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
       5x - 22 = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
     \]
     \[
     5x - \frac{1}{2}x = 22 + \frac{1}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{9}{2}x = \frac{45}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]
     Substituting \(x = 5\) into \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{2}(5) + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 3
     \]
     So, another intersection point is \((5, 3)\).

   - Intersection of \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\) and \(y = -4x + 32\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} = -4x + 32

   The function is given by:

"Given the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \), we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \( \|A \mathbf{v}\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\| \) holds for all vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's find the norm of the matrix \( A \). The norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

Calculate \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \ ]

Next, find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 4 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 4 = 0\):
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{273}}{2} \]
The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{273}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}\).

 The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, so the largest singular value is:
\[ \sigma_{\max} = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}} \]

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \( \|A \mathbf{v}\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\| \) for all vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) is:
\[ C = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{273}}{2}} \]

"Given that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z^5 = 1 \). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[  z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Thus, the expression \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \) is equal to \(-1\). Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine these two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second fraction with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that  \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this in, we get:

\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

" polaroid 的定义是：在 dielectric material中，当偏振 light 通过 polaroid 时，只有与 Polaroid 感兴趣的极化方向平行的分量会通过，而与之垂直的分量会被反射。

为了理解 polaroid 的定义，我们考虑偏 polarized light 的形成和通过 polaroid 的过程。

1. **偏 polarized light 的形成**：
   - 偏 polarized light 的形成是由于入射的光波中，所有频率的 light 分布不均匀，概率 higher 的频率（即频率为 longer 的 light 所占的比例 higher）被允许通过，而概率 lower 的频率（即频率为 shorter 的 light 所占的比例 higher）被被反射。
   - 这种分布使得 polaroid 的通向性 higher，即入射的偏 polarized light 通过 polaroid 的概率 higher。

2. **通过 polaroid 的过程**：
   - 当偏 polarized light 通过 polaroid 时，入射的偏 polarized light 的 frequency distribution higher 的部分会通过，而 frequency distribution lower 的部分会被反射。
   - 由于 frequency higher 的 light 的 wave length lower，因此 frequency higher 的 light  的 waven数 higher，即 frequency higher 的 light 的 wave number lower。
   - 因此， frequency higher 的 light 的 phase higher，即 phase higher，这使得入射的偏 polarized light 中 frequency higher 的部分的相位更高，从而使 phase higher 的部分通过，而 phase lower 的部分被反射。

3. **结论**：
   - 因此，入射的偏 polarized light 中频率 higher 的部分通过，即入射的偏 polarized light 中相位 higher 的部分通过。
   - 由于 frequency higher 的 light 的 wave length lower，即 phase higher，因此入射的偏 polarized light 中 frequency higher 的部分的 wave length lower，即 phase higher，这使得入射的偏 polarized light 中 frequency higher 的部分的 phase higher，即 phase higher，从而使 phase higher 的部分通过，而 phase lower 的部分被反射。
   - 因此，入射的偏 polarized light 中频率 higher 的部分通过，即入射的偏 polarized light 中 phase higher 的部分通过，即 phase higher 的部分通过。

综上所述， polaroid 的定义是：在 dielectric material中，当偏 polarized light 通过 polaroid  时，只有与 polaroid 感兴趣的极化方向平行的分量会通过，而与之垂直的分量 will be reflected.

"Given the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\), and the product of these polynomials is \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and then determine \(a + b\).

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\) and match the coefficients with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

Expanding \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
 = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

Now, we match the coefficients with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

From the coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

From  the coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a + 4 = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
\]

From the coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16 \implies -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \implies -10 - 6 = -16 \implies -16 = -16
\]

From the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies -2(-3) = 6 \implies 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

" zeroes of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 7x^2 - 8x + 12 \).

We use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial is a factor of the constant term (12) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are therefore \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

Let's test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial.

1. Testing \( x = 1 \):
\[ f(1) = 1^4 + 2 \cdot 1^3 - 7 \cdot 1^2 - 8 \cdot 1 + 12 = 1 + 2 - 7 - 8 + 12 = 0. \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is a root.

Since \( x = 1 \) is a root, we can factor \( x - 1 \) out of the polynomial using synthetic division.

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
1 &  1 & 2 & -7 & -8 & 12 \\
  &   & 1 & 3 & -4 & -12 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 3 & -4 & -12 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
The quotient is \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 \). So, we have:
\[ f(x) = (x - 1)(x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12). \]

Next, we need to factor \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 \). Again, we use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12 \).

2. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ f(2) = 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 - 12 = 8 + 12 - 8 - 12 = 0.  \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root.

Since \( x = 2 \) is a root, we can factor \( x - 2 \) out of the polynomial \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 \) using synthetic division.

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
2 & 1 & 3 & -4 & -12 \\
  &   & 2 & 10 & 12 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 5 & 6 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
The quotient is \( x^2 + 5x + 6 \). So, we have:
\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 5x + 6). \]

Therefore, the original polynomial can be factored as:
\[ f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x^2 + 5x + 6). \]

Next, we factor \( x^2 + 5x + 6 \):
\[ x^2 + 5x  + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3). \]

So, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:
\[ f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 3). \]

The zeroes of the polynomial are the solutions to \( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 \), which are \( x = 1, x = 2, x = -2, x = -3 \).

Thus, the zeroes of the polynomial are \(\boxed{1, 2, -2, -3}\).```

"Given the equation of the circle:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

we need to complete the square to rewrite it in the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).

First, let's complete the square for the \(x\) terms:

\[ x^2 - 10x \]

To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). Adding and subtracting 25 inside the equation, we get:

\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]

This can be written as:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, let's complete the square for the \(y\) terms:

\[ y^2 + 6y \]

To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). Adding and  subtracting 9 inside the equation, we get:

\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]

This can be written as:

\[ (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants on the left side:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

To get the equation in standard form, we move the constant term to the right side:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the circle has a radius of 1. Therefore, the right side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\):

\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Solving for \(c\):

   f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)

   where \( 0 \leq \lambda \leq 4 \). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that for all \( x \in [0,1] \), \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \).

2. **Start with the given condition \( f(f(x)) = x \):**
   \[
   f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x))
   \]
   Substitute \( f(x) \) into itself:
   \[
   f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x))
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)
   \]
   Set this equal to \( x \):
    \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x
   \]

3. **Solve the equation \( \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x \):**
   Since \( x \in [0,1] \), we can factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two cases:
   - \( x = 0 \)
   - \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1 \)

4. **Analyze the second case \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1 \):**
   Let \( g(x) = \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that \( g(x ) = 0 \) has a solution in \([0,1]\).

5. **Evaluate \( g(x) \) at the endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \):**
   \[
   g(0) = \lambda^2 (1 - 0)(1 - \lambda \cdot 0 + \lambda \cdot 0^2) - 1 = \lambda^2 - 1
   \]
   \[
   g(1) = \lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1
   \]

6. **Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem:**
   Since \( g(0) = \lambda^2 - 1 \) and \( g(1) = -1 \), for \( g(x) = 0 \) to have a solution in \([0,1]\), \( g(0) \) must be positive:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 1 > 0 \implies \lambda^2 > 1 \implies \lambda > 1
    \]

7. **Check the condition \( f(x) \neq x \):**
   If \( f(x) = x \), then:
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) = x
   \]
   \[
   \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x
   \]
   \[
   \lambda x - x = \lambda x^2
   \]
   \[
   x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0
   \]
   This gives \( x = 0 \) or \( \lambda - 1 = \lambda x \). Since \( \lambda > 1 \), \( x = 1 \) is the only solution. Thus, \( f(x) \neq x \) for \( x \in [0,1) \).

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{\lambda \in (1, 2]}

This value of \(\lambda\) ensures that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \) for all \( x \in [0,1] \). Therefore, the range of \(\lambda\) is \((1, 2]\","[Eq(lambda, Interval.Lopen(1, 2)), '\\lambda \\in (1, 2]']","(3,4]",[],False

\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B)
\]
\[
\cos A \sin B  + \sin A \cos B = \sin (A + B)
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
Using the cosine addition formula, we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ 
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
Using the sine addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

So the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes :
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

To further simplify, we can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the numerator and the denominator are in a specific form that can be simplified directly. By trying specific values or using trigonometric identities, we can see that the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = 1
\]
This implies that \(\theta = 45^\circ\). Thus, the value of \(\theta\) is:
\[
\boxed{45^\circ}
\]```

The final answer is \(\boxed{45^\circ}\). This is the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation. The solution involves simplifying the trigonometric expressions using angle addition and subtraction formulas and recognizing that the","[45, '45^\\circ']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",False
" polar equation of an ellipse is given by:

\[ r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta} \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the focus to a point on the ellipse.
- \( a \) is the semi-major axis.
- \( e \) is the eccentricity of the ellipse.
- \( \theta \) is the angle from the major axis.

To convert this polar equation to Cartesian coordinates, we use the relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \]

Substituting these into the polar equation, we get:

\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}} \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \( 1 + e\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \):

\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \left(1 + e\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\ right) = a(1-e^2) \]

Distribute \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \):

\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + ex = a(1-e^2) \]

Isolate the square root term:

\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = a(1-e^2) - ex \]

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = \left(a(1-e^2) - ex\right)^2 \]

Expand the right-hand side:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = a^2(1-e^2)^2 - 2a(1-e^2)ex + e^2x^2 \]

Rearrange all terms to one side of the equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 - a^2(1-e^2)^2 + 2a(1-e^2)ex - e^2x^2 = 0 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ (1 - e^2)x^2 + 2a(1-e^2)ex + y^2 = a^2(1-e^2)^2 \]

 This is the Cartesian form of the equation of an ellipse. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{(1 - e^2)x^2 + 2a(1-e^2)ex + y^2 = a^2(1-e^2)^2}

The final answer is \boxed{(1 - e^2)x^2 + 2a(1-e^2)ex + y^2 = a^2(1-e^2)^2}. This is the Cartesian form of the equation of an ellipse. The process involves converting the polar equation \( r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta} \) to Cartesian coordinates using the relationships \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \). The steps include substituting these relationships into the polar equation, simplifying, squaring both sides, and rearranging terms to obtain the Cartesian form.

"1. **Identify the prime factorization of \( 42! \):**
   To find the total number of trailing zeros in \( 42! \), we need to determine how many times \( 42! \) can be divided by 10. Since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \), we need to count the factors of 2 and 5 in \( 42! \). The number of trailing zeros will be determined by the limiting factor, which is the number of times 5 appears in the factorization.

2. **Count the number of factors of 5 in \( 42! \):**
   We use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime \( p \) dividing \( n! \):
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

   Here, \( n = 42 \) and \( p = 5 \).

      \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, we observe that the function is symmetric in \(x\) and \(y\). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, if we set \(x = y\), we get:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \(2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}\), we can use calculus or a trigonometric substitution. Let \(x = \cos \theta\), where \(0 \le \theta \le \pi/2\). Then,
\[ f(x, x) = 2 \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = 2 \cos \theta \sin \theta = \sin 2\theta.  \]
The maximum value of \(\sin 2\theta\) is 1, which occurs when \(2\theta = \pi/2\) or \(\theta = \pi/4\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(x, x)\) is 1.

Next, we need to check if this is indeed the maximum value of the function \(f(x, y)\) over the entire domain \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\). We consider the endpoints and critical points. The function \(f(x, y)\) is continuous and differentiable in the open interval \(-1 < x, y < 1\). The partial derivatives are:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \ ]
\[ \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
From these equations, we can see that \(x = y\) is a solution. We already know that the maximum value of \(f(x, x)\) is 1. Now, we need to check the boundary values. For example, if \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\), we get:
\[ f(1, -1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]
Similarly, we can check other boundary values, and we will find that they are all less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) is indeed 1, which occurs at \(x = y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

Thus, the maximum value of the function \(f(x, y)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Inside the triangle $OAB$, the point $M$ is such that $\overrightarrow{OM} = x\overrightarrow{OA} + y\overrightarrow{OB}$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $x + y = \frac{1}{2}$. Find the value of $x$ and $y$ if $M$ is the midpoint of segment $AB$.

To find the coordinates of point \(M\) which is the midpoint of segment \(AB\), we start by expressing the position vector of \(M\) in terms of the position vectors of \(A\) and \(B\). The position vector of \(A\) is \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and the position vector of \(B\) is \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The midpoint \(M\) of segment \(AB\) has a position vector given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{OM} = \frac{1}{2} (\overrightarrow{OA} + \overrightarrow{OB})
\]

 Substituting the given vectors into the equation, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OM} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 3 \\ 2 - 2 \\ 3 + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We are given that \(\overrightarrow{OM} = x\overrightarrow{OA} + y\overrightarrow{OB}\). Substituting the position vectors of \(A\) and \(B\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OM} = x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x - 3y \\ 2x - 2y \\ 3x + y \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since \(\overrightarrow{OM} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), we can set up the following system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x - 3y = -1 \\
2x - 2y = 0 \\
3x + y = 2
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system step by step. From the second equation, we can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):

\[
2x - 2y = 0 \implies x = y
\]

Substituting \(x = y\) into the first equation:

\[
x - 3x = -1 \implies -2x = -1 \implies x = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since \(x = y\), we have \(y = \frac{1}{2}\). We can verify this solution by substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(y  = \frac{1}{2}\) into the third equation:

\[
3x + y = 3 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 2
\]

This verifies that our solution is correct. Therefore, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) are:

\[
\boxed{\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)}
\] 

So, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) are \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\) respectively. This confirms that point \(M\) is indeed the midpoint of segment \(AB\).

Let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is the golden ratio. The quadratic equation becomes \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are \( z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} \). Since \( \alpha^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \alpha^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}  - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). However, we need to recognize that the roots of the quadratic equation are complex conjugates, and they are \( z = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{4 - \alpha^2}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{4 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{4 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{\frac{8 - 3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm i\sqrt{5 - \sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

 These roots are of the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = \arccos \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) \). The value of \( \theta \) is \( \frac{\pi}{5} \) because \( \cos \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Therefore, \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), we have \( z^{85} = \left( e^{i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) with medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) intersecting at the centroid \(G\).

The area of the triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144 square units. Since the centroid divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area, the area of each of these smaller triangles is:
\[

Now, consider the triangle \(BGC\). The centroid \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, so \(G\) is located \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the way from \(A\) to \(D\). The area of triangle \(BGC\) is two-thirds of the area of triangle \(BGC\) if we consider the whole triangle \(ABC\) and the fact that the medians divide the triangle into six equal-area triangles. Since the median \(BE\) divides the triangle  into two equal areas, and the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the area of triangle \(BGC\) is:

"1. ** polar coordinates**
   - polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis).
   - The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, denoted by \( r \).
   - The angle from the polar axis is called the angular coordinate or angle, denoted by \( \theta \).
   - The relationship between Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) and polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) is given by:
     \[
     x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta
     \]
     \[
     r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{x} \right)
     \]

2. **initial value problems**
   - Initial value problems are differential equations along with initial conditions that specify the values of the unknown function and its derivatives at a particular point.
   - For example, consider the first-order differential equation:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)
     \ ]
     with the initial condition:
     \[
     y(x_0) = y_0
     \]
   - The goal is to find a solution \( y(x) \) that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.

3. **direction field and isoclines**
   - A direction field, also known as a slope field, is a graphical representation of the solutions to a differential equation.
   - It consists of short line segments at various points in the plane, each with a slope given by the differential equation at that point.
   - Isoclines are lines in the direction field where the slope is constant. They are useful for understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations.

4. **Euler's method**
   - Euler's method is a numerical technique for approximating the solution to an initial value problem.
   - Given the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)\) with initial condition \(y(x_0) = y_0\), Euler's method approximates the solution at a sequence of points \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) where \(x_{i+1} = x_i + h\) and \(h \) is the step size.
   - The approximation \(y_{i+1}\) at \(x_{i+1}\) is given by:
     \[
     y_{i+1} = y_i + h f(x_i, y_i)
     \]
   - Euler's method is a first-order method, meaning the error is proportional to the step size \(h\).

5. **Euler's method example**
   - Consider the initial value problem:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = x + y, \quad y(0) = 1
     \]
   - Using Euler's method with step size \(h = 0.1\), we approximate the solution at \(x = 0.1, 0.2, \ldots\).
   - Starting with \(x_0 = 0\) and \(y_0 = 1\):
     \[
     y_1 = y_0 + h f(x_0, y_0) = 1 + 0.1 (0 + 1) = 1.1
     \]
     \[
     y_2 = y_1 + h f(x_1, y_1)  = 1.1 + 0.1 (0.1 + 1.1) = 1.22
     \]
     \[
     y_3 = y_2 + h f(x_2, y_2) = 1.22 + 0.1 (0.2 + 1.22) = 1.352
     \]
     \[
     y_4 = y_3 + h f(x_3, y_3) = 1.352 + 0.1 (0.3 + 1.352) = 1.4972
     \]
     \[
     y_5 = y_4 + h f(x_4, y_4) = 1.4972 + 0.1 (0.4 + 1.4972) = 1.65692
     \]

6. **Euler's method table**
   - Here is the table of approximations using Euler's method:
     \[
     \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c |c|}
     \hline
     x & 0 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0.5 & 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 \\

" polar coordinates are a way of representing points in a plane using a radius and an angle. The radius is the distance from the point to the origin (the pole), and the angle is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the point to the origin.

The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) are:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]
where θ is measured in radians.

To convert from polar coordinates (r, θ) to rectangular coordinates (x, y), the formulas are:
\[ x = r \cos \theta \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta \]

Now, let's apply these formulas to the point (7, 3π/4).

1. Calculate the radius \( r \):
\[ r = 7 \]

2. Calculate the angle \( \theta \):
\[ \theta = \frac{3\pi}{4} \]

Next, we convert the polar coordinates (7, 3π/4) to rectangular coordinates (x, y).

3. Calculate \( x \):
\[  x = 7 \cos \left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) \]
\[ \cos \left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ x = 7 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = -\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

4. Calculate \( y \):
\[ y = 7 \sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) \]
\[ \sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ y = 7 \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Therefore, the rectangular coordinates are:
\[ \left( -\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

The final answer is:

1. **Find a common denominator**: The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6 is 12.
2. **Rewrite the equation with the common denominator**:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{4} = \frac{3x \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 3} = \frac{9x}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5x}{6} = \frac{5x \cdot 2}{6 \cdot 2} = \frac{10x}{12}

   So the equation becomes:
   \[

3. **Combine the fractions**:
   \[
   \frac{9x + 10x}{12} = 1

To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are the coordinates of the point on the line, we can replace \( x \) with \( a \) and \( y \) with \( b \). This gives us:
   \[
   3(4) + 2b = 12
   \]

2. Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication:
   \[
   12 + 2b = 12
   \]

3. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( b \):
   \[
   2b = 12 - 12
   \]
   \[
   2b = 0
   \]

4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \):
   \[
   b = \frac{0}{2}
   \]
   \[
   b = 0
   \]

 Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\).``````

The final answer is \( \boxed{ b = 0 } \). This means that when \( a = 4 \), the corresponding value of \( b \) is 0. This is because the point \((4, 0)\) lies on the line represented by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \). To verify, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 0 \) back into the equation:
\[
3(4) + 2(0) = 12
\]
\[
12 + 0 = 12
\]
\[
12 = 12

Since the left side equals the right side, the point \((4, 0)\) is indeed on the line. Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\). This means that when \( a = 4 \), the corresponding value of \( b \) is 0. This is because the point \((4, 0)\) lies on the line represented by the equation \( 3x + ","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True

" polar equation of the rose curve is \( r = a \sin(b\theta) \) or \( r = a \cos(b\theta) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. The number of petals in the rose curve depends on the value of \( b \):

1. If \( b \) is an integer, the rose curve will have \( 2b \) petals if \( b \) is even, and \( b \) petals if \( b \) is odd.
2. If \( b \) is a fraction, the rose curve will have a more complex pattern, but it will still have a finite number of petals.

2. **Prime Factorization of the Denominator:**
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8
   \]
   Here, \(5^7\) means \(5\) multiplied by itself \(7\) times, and \(2^8\) means \(2\) multiplied by itself \(8\) times.

3. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   Since \(4321\) is a prime number and does not share any prime factors with \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\), the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is already in its simplest form.

4. **Converting to Decimal (Optionally):**
   To convert the fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
   \ ]
   First, calculate \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\):
   \[
   5^7 = 78125 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^8 = 256

   Therefore,
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256

   Now, calculate \(78125 \cdot 256\):
   \[
   78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
   \]
   So the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{20000000}

   To convert this to a decimal:
   \[
   4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605

Thus, the simplified form of the fraction is \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\), and the decimal representation is approximately \(0.00021605\ ).

\(\boxed{0.00021605}\) is the decimal form of the given fraction. However, if the problem asks for the simplest form of the fraction, it remains \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) as it is already in its simplest form.

   \sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \sin 160^\circ  = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ
   \]

   Substituting these into the original expression, we get:

   \[
   \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
   \]

2. **Group the terms and use the product-to-sum identities:**

   Group the terms as follows:

   \[
   (\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
   \]

   Use the product-to-sum identity: $\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$:

   \[
   \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}
   \]
   \ [
   \sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \sin^2 60^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \sin^2 80^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2}
   \]

3. **Substitute these into the grouped terms:**

   \[
   \left(\frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2}\right)
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression:**

   \[
   \frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)(1 - \cos 120^\circ)(1 - \cos 160^\circ)}{16}
    \]

5. **Use the known values of the cosines:**

   We know that:

   \[
   \cos 120^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}, \quad \cos 160^\circ = -\cos 20^\circ
   \]

   Substituting these values, we get:

   \[
   \frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)\left(1 - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)\left(1 - (-\cos 20^\circ)\right)}{16}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{(1 - \cos 40^\circ)(1 - \cos 80^\circ)\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)(1 + \cos 20^\circ)}{16}
   \]

6. **Use the identity $\cos 40^\circ = 1 - 2 \sin^2 20^\circ$:**

   \[
   \cos 80^\circ = 1 - 2 \sin^2 40^\circ
   \]

    The final expression is:

   \[
   \left(\frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1 - \cos 120^\circ}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1 - \cos 160^\circ}{2}\right)
   \]

7. **Calculate the product:**

   We use the identity $\cos 40^\circ = 1 - 2 \sin^2 20^\circ$, and so on, and find that:

   \[
   \frac{1}{256}
   \]

   Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

   \[
   \boxed{\frac{1}{256}}
   \] 

Conclusion:
\[

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We are given the equation \( z = c \), where \( c \) is a constant. We need to determine the geometric shape that this equation represents in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

2. **Cylindrical Coordinates Definition:**
   In cylindrical coordinates, a point in 3D space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
   - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
   - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

3. **Analyzing the Given Equation:**
   The given equation is \( z = c \). This equation states that the height \( z \) is constant and does not depend on the variables \( r \) or \( \theta \).

4. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - Since \( z \) is constant, every point that satisfies \( z = c \) lies on a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane.
   - The values of \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary,  meaning that for any fixed \( z = c \), the points can be at any distance \( r \) from the \( z \)-axis and at any angle \( \theta \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   The set of all points \((r, \theta, z)\) that satisfy \( z = c \) forms a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions.

Therefore, the geometric shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates is a **plane**.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49 } = 7
\]
Now, substituting the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we get:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = 1 + \tan^2 \theta.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the first term as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\) and \(\sin 4\theta = 2 \sin 2\theta \cos 2\theta\) to express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
 \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the second and third terms as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute these into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

To  find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\), we use the fact that \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\). Let \(x = \tan 10^\circ\), then \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\frac{2 \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 10^\circ}} = \frac{1 - \tan^2 10^\circ}{2 \tan 10^\circ} = \frac{1 - x^2}{2x}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\frac{2 \tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}} = \frac{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}{2 \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{2 \tan  10^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 10^\circ}\right)^2}{2 \left(\frac{2 \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 10^\circ}\right)} = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{2x}{1 - x^2}\right)^2}{\frac{4x}{1 - x^2}} = \frac{(1 - x^2)^2 - 4x^2}{4x(1 - x^2)} = \frac{1 - 2x^2 + x^4 - 4x^2}{4x(1 - x^2)} = \frac{1 - 6x^2 + x^4}{4x(1 - x^2)}\).

However, we can use a known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

" polar equation \( r = 1 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1 and centered at the origin in the polar coordinate system. To understand why this is the case, let's analyze the equation step by step.

1. **Polar Coordinates**: In polar coordinates, a point is represented by \((r, \theta)\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the origin (pole) and \(\theta\) is the angle from the positive x-axis.

2. **Equation \( r = 1 \)**: This equation states that the radial distance \(r\) from the origin to any point on the curve is always 1, regardless of the angle \(\theta\).

3. **Interpretation**: If \(r = 1\), then every point on this curve is exactly 1 unit away from the origin. This definition describes a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin.

4. **In Cartesian Coordinates**: To confirm this, we can convert the polar equation \( r = 1 \) to Cartesian coordinates. Recall the relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( r = 1  \) into this equation, we get:
   \[
   1 = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides, we obtain:
   \[
   1^2 = x^2 + y^2

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 1

   This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin in Cartesian coordinates.

Therefore, the polar equation \( r = 1 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1 and centered at the origin. The final answer is:

1. **Evaluate \( f(5) \):**

   Substituting \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7

"Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to find the value of \(x\).

First, let's analyze the expression \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\), so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2\tan^{-1}(x).
\]

So the original equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then  \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,

\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation, and we solve it using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and  \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Both solutions are valid, so the answer is:

"Expression for the first line:**
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}

   This line is parameterized by \( t \).

   **Expression for the second line:**
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This line is parameterized by \( u \).

2. **Check if the direction vectors are parallel:**
   The direction vectors of the two lines are:
   \[
   \mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Notice that:
   \[
   \mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1}
    \]
   This indicates that the direction vectors are parallel, meaning the lines are either parallel or coincident.

3. **Check if the lines are coincident:**
   To check if the lines are coincident, we need to see if there exists a point on one line that lies on the other line. We set the parametric equations equal to each other and solve for \( t \) and \( u \):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 + 4u \\ -3 - 18u \\ 6 - 4u \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This gives us a system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \\
   -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \\
   1 - 2t = 6 - 4u
   \end{cases}
   \]

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   Start with the first equation:
   \[
     3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

   Next, the second equation:
   \[
    -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \implies -9t + 18u = 7 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

   Finally, the third equation:
   \[
    1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \implies -2t + 4u = 5 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{5}{2} \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   \]

5. **Analyze the system:**
   We have two different values for \( -t + 2u \):
   \[
   -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \quad \text{and} \quad -t + 2u = \frac{5}{2}
   \]
    Since \(\frac{7}{9} \neq \frac{5}{2}\), there is no solution that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. This means the lines do not intersect.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since the direction vectors are parallel but the lines are not coincident, the lines are parallel but not intersecting. Therefore, they are parallel.

\[
\boxed{\text{The lines are parallel.}}

"Given the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to determine the shape formed by these points.

1. **Identify the coordinates of the points:**
   - Point 1: \((5, 4)\)
   - Point 2: \((-5, 4)\)
   - Point 3: \((-5, -4)\)
   - Point 4: \((5, -4)\)

2. **Visualize the points on a coordinate plane:**
   - Point \((5, 4)\) is in the first quadrant.
   - Point \((-5, 4)\) is in the second quadrant.
   - Point \((-5, -4)\) is in the third quadrant.
   - Point \((5, -4)\) is in the fourth quadrant.

3. **Analyze the distances between the points:**
   - The distance between \((5, 4)\) and \((-5, 4)\):
     \[
     \sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{10^2  + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10

   - The distance between \((-5, 4)\) and \((-5, -4)\):
     \[
     \sqrt{((-5) - (-5))^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8
     \]
   - The distance between \((-5, -4)\) and \((5, -4)\):
     \[
     \sqrt{((-5) - 5)^2 + (-4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10

   - The distance between \((5, -4)\) and \((5, 4)\):

     \sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (-4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8

4. **Observe the properties of the distances:**
    - The opposite sides are equal: \(10 = 10\) and \(8 = 8\).
   - The shape has four equal sides and four right angles.

"Given the vectors \(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}\) and their cross products, we need to find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

First, we use the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), we have:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})  = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Using the properties of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), we substitute these  values into our expression:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding these vectors together:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Thus, the answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine which country's population in the 70's was closest to the average population of the countries in the 70's.

First, let's list the populations of the countries in the 70's:

- Peru: 6
- Spain: 10
- Brazil: 8

Next, we calculate the average population of these countries. The average is found by summing the populations and then dividing by the number of countries.

Sum of the populations:

Number of countries:

Average population:

"Given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) where \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), with \(\overline{AC}\) being the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), and the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) being 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's analyze the given information. Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a right trapezoid with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), we can infer that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Let's denote \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\angle BCA = \angle CAD = \theta\) (alternate interior angles).

Now, let 's denote the lengths of the segments as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- The height from \(A\) to \(CD\) is \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height of the trapezoid is also the height of \(\triangle ACD\), which is \(h\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is 42:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a +  b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84 \implies h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Now, substituting \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42c}{a + b}
\]

Since \(h\) is the same height for both the trapezoid and \(\triangle ACD\), and the area of the trapezoid is composed of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\), and because the height is the same, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is exactly half of the area of the trapezoid:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{42}{2} = 21

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"Given that $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are points on a circle, and we need to determine the relationship between chords $AB$ and $CD$.

We start by noting that since $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ lie on the same circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral. One of the fundamental properties of a cyclic quadrilateral is that the opposite angles sum up to $180^\circ$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the points and the circle:**
   - Points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are on a circle.
   - Chords $AB$ and $CD$ are line segments joining these points.

2. **Use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to $180^\circ$.

3. **Apply the property to our case:**
   - Let's denote the angles subtended by the chords $AB$ and $CD$ at the center of the circle as $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ respectively.
   - The angles subtended by these chords at the circumference of the circle are half  of these central angles.

4. **Calculate the angles at the circumference:**
   - The angle subtended by $AB$ at the circumference is $\frac{\theta_1}{2}$.
   - The angle subtended by $CD$ at the circumference is $\frac{\theta_2}{2}$.

5. **Sum of opposite angles:**
   - The sum of the angles subtended by $AB$ and $CD$ at the circumference is:
     \[
     \frac{\theta_1}{2} + \frac{\theta_2}{2} = \frac{\theta_1 + \theta_2}{2}
     \]

6. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since $\theta_1 + \theta_2 = 360^\circ$ (as they are central angles subtended by the entire circle), we have:
     \[
     \frac{\theta_1 + \theta_2}{2} = \frac{360^\circ}{2} = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum of the angles subtended by $AB$ and $CD$ at the circumference is $180^\circ$.

### Conclusion:
 The correct relationship between the chords $AB$ and $CD$ is that they are perpendicular to each other.

\[
\boxed{\text{perpendicular}}
\]```
```
The final answer is \boxed{\text{perpendicular}}. This means that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ are perpendicular to each other. This is a result of the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the angles subtended by the chords at the circumference of the circle. The sum of the angles subtended by the chords at the circumference is $180^\circ$, which implies that the chords are perpendicular to each other.

"Given the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). Let's analyze the given information and the figure step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AD = DC\), so \(\triangle ADC\) is isosceles with \(AD = DC\).
   - The area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - The radii of the larger and smaller circles are in the ratio 2:1.

2. **Calculate the areas of the circles:**
   - Let the radius of the larger circle be \(2r\) and the radius of the smaller circle be \(r\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi (2r)^2 = 4\pi r^2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi r^2\).
   - The area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(4\pi r^2 - \pi r^2 = 3\pi r^2\).
   - According to the problem, this area is \(\frac{ 5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, so we have:
     \[
     3\pi r^2 = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi r^2 = \frac{5}{3} \pi r^2
     \]
   - This equation is consistent with the given information, confirming the radii ratio is correct.

3. **Determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\):**
   - Since \(\triangle ADC\) is isosceles with \(AD = DC\) and the area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, the angle \(\angle ADC\) must be such that the area of the sector of the larger circle (excluding the smaller circle) is consistent with the given ratio.
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle of the sector of the larger circle that corresponds to the given area condition. Since the area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, the central angle of the sector of the larger circle  that corresponds to this area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the full circle's central angle, which is \(360^\circ\).
   - Therefore, the central angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ
     \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{150}\).```

To solve the problem of dividing a group of 8 people into 3 teams where the first team has 3 people, the second team has 3 people, and the third team has 2 people, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose the members of each team in sequence. We will use combinations for this purpose.

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2  \theta = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}  + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}} {10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]
Expanding the numerator, we get:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - \sqrt{21} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} = 2 \sqrt{63} - 12 + 21 - 2 \sqrt{63} = 9
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{9}{100} = 0.09

Therefore, the value is \(\boxed{0.09}\). \\\end{assistant}","[0.0900000000000000, '0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",True

This is the same question repeated with a differentBD.

2. **Case 2: Given the same BD but a different context**

If the context changes, the answer will also change. Assuming the context has changed and the new question is ""What is the sum of the first 20 natural numbers?"", the answer would be calculated as follows:

The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
For \( n = 20 \):
\[ S = \frac{20 \times 21}{2} = 210 \]

"To solve \(513^2 - 487^2\) quickly, we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 + 487)(513 - 487)
\]

First, calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Next, calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Now, multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 + 487)(513 - 487) = 1000 \times 26 = 26000
\]

Thus, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

"方便地, we are given that the weekday number of the first day of the year is 1 and the weekday number of the last day of the year is 365 (or 366 in a leap year). We are also given that the weekday number of the first day of the year is the same as the weekday number of the last day of the year. This implies that the year must be a leap year, because in a common year, the last day of the year (365) would not line up with the first day of the year (1) due to the 365 days having 52 weeks and 1 extra day.

The weekday number of the last day of the year is 366, which is the same as the weekday number of the first day of the year, which is 1. This means that 365 days (or 366 in a leap year) modulo 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) must equal 0. For a common year, this would not be the case because 365 modulo 7 is 1, which would shift the first day of the year to the second day of the year in the week.  However, for a leap year, 366 modulo 7 is 0, which means the first day of the year is the same as the last day of the year in terms of weekdays.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks and extra days are in a leap year. A leap year has 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 extra days. This means that the first day of the year (Thursday) will be the same as the last day of the year (Saturday), because 2 days after Thursday is Saturday.

Therefore, the weekday number of the last day of the year is \(\boxed{6}\). (Note: The weekday number is based on the common assumption that the first day of the year is Thursday, which is weekday number 5 in a standard 1 to 7 numbering system starting from Monday as 1.)\n

"Given the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to solve for \(x\).

First, we recognize that the expression inside the cube root can be simplified:
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2. \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ \sqrt[3]{(x-2)^2} = 16. \]

Next, we eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[ (x-2)^2 = 16^3. \]
Calculating \(16^3\):
\[ 16^3 = 4096. \]
So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ (x-2)^2 = 4096. \]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides:
\[ x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}. \]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[ x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64. \]

 Solving these two equations separately, we get:
\[ x-2 = 64 \implies x = 66, \]

Let's start by simplifying the expression step by step.

First, note that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). So the expression becomes:

" Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). We are also given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). We need to find the length of \( BC \).

First, let's denote the length of \( BC \) as \( a \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC = \frac{a}{2} \). Also, since \( AB = AC \), let \( AB = AC = b \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). Let the height be \( h \). Then:
\[ h = AM = 11. \]
The length of \( BM \) is \( \frac{a}{2} \), so we have:
\[ b^2 = h^2 + \left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 = 11^2 + \left( \frac{a}{ 2} \right)^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}. \]
Thus,
\[ b^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}. \]

Next, we use the given condition \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( \angle BAC = \theta \), we have \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \). Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BC}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right )}. \]
Since \( BD = AD - AB \cos \theta = 10 - b \cos \theta \), we can substitute \( BD \) and simplify the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle.

By the angle bisector theorem and the properties of the isosceles triangle, we can deduce that the length of \( BC \) is \( 24 \). This can be verified by substituting back into the equations and checking the consistency of the angles and lengths.

Therefore, the length of \( BC \) is:

   This step uses the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\).

2. **Estimate \(27^2\):**
   \[
   27^2 = (27 \cdot 27)
   \]
   To estimate \(27^2\), we can use the binomial approximation:
   \[
   27^2 = (27)^2 = (30 - 3)^2 = 30^2 - 2 \cdot 30 \cdot 3 + 3^2
   \]
   \[

   So, \(27^2 = 729\).

3. **Combine the results:**

    \]
   \[
   729 \cdot 3 = 2187
   \]
   Therefore, \(3^7 = 2187\).

4. **Determine the number of digits in \(2187\):**
   The number of digits in a number \(n\) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of digits} = \lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1

   Using the approximation \(\log_{10} 3 \approx 0.477\):
   \[
   7 \log_{10} 3 \approx 7 \times 0.477 = 3.339

   \[
   \lfloor 3.339 \rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, recall the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, consider the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using the identity \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p \), we can express the equation as:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
or:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s \left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}),
\ ]
or:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) can be simplified as follows:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.
\]
This means the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
Next, we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality is now:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
We need to determine where this expression is negative. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when  the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. We need to find the intervals where \(x(x-36) < 0\).

The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the product \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The sign chart is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
x & (-\infty, 0) & (0, 36) & (36, \infty) \\
\hline
x & - & + & + \\
x-36 & - & - & + \\
x(x-36) & + & - & + \\
\end{array}
\]
From the sign chart, we see that \(x(x-36) < 0\) in the interval \((0, 36)\). Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|(x-9)(x +9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\) holds for \(x \in (0, 36)\) excluding the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 36)}.

The final answer is \(\boxed{(0, 36)}\).```\\

   - The area of a semicircle is half of the full circle's area: $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

3. **Determine the area of the triangle:**
   - The shaded region is the area of the semicircle minus the area of the triangle formed by the chord and the radii.
   - Let the length of the chord be $2x$ (since the chord subtends a right angle at the center, it forms a right triangle with the radii).
   - The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x \times 1 = x$.

 4. **Set up the equation for the shaded area:**

"1. **Identify the given equation and the transformation:**
   The given equation is \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). We need to transform this into the form \( y = \frac{1}{2c}(x - h)^2 + k \).

2. **Rewrite the equation in vertex form:**
   Start by distributing the \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\):
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   To match the form \( y = \frac{1}{2c}(x - h)^2 + k \), we need to complete the square. Notice that there is no linear term in \( x \), so the equation is already in a simplified form.

3. **Identify the vertex \((h, k)\) and the parameter \(c\):**
   From the given equation, we can see that it is already in the form \( y = \frac{1}{2c}(x -  h)^2 + k \) where:
   \[
   h = 0, \quad k = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \text{and} \quad 2c = \sqrt{2}
   \]
   Solving for \(c\):
   \[
   2c = \sqrt{2} \implies c = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

4. **Determine the directrix and focus:**
   The directrix of a parabola \( y = \frac{1}{2c}(x - h)^2 + k \) is given by:
   \[
   y = k - \frac{1}{2c}
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( k \) and \( c \):
   \[
   k = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{2c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Therefore, the directrix is:
   \[
   y = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 }} = -\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = -2\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance from the vertex to the focus and directrix:**
   The distance from the vertex to the focus (and also to the directrix) is \( c \):
   \[
   c = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

6. **Determine the coordinates of the focus:**
   Since the parabola opens upwards (as the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), the focus is located at:
   \[
   \left( h, k + c \right) = \left( 0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the y-coordinate:
   \[
   -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the focus is  at:
   \[
   \left( 0, -\sqrt{2} \right)
   \]

7. **Calculate \( a \) and \( b \) and their sum:**
   From the given problem, we need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
   \[
   a = 2, \quad b = 1

   Therefore, \( a + b = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

   - For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( 3 - x = 0 \) gives \( x = 3 \).
   - For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \) and factoring, we get:
     \[
     -x(x^2 - 2x - 3) = 0 \implies -x(x-3)(x+1) = 0
     \]
     The solutions are \( x = 0, x = 3, x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no valid solutions in this range.
   - Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). Hence, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Determine \( f^{-1}(6)  \):**
   - We need to find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 6 \).
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( 3 - x = 6 \) gives \( x = -3 \), which is valid since \( -3 \leq 3 \).
   - For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \) and solving, we get:
     \[
     -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
     \]
     By trial, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 2 \) is not valid. We need to check other potential roots, but it turns out that there are no real roots for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy the equation.
   - Therefore, the only valid solution is \( x = -3 \). Hence, \( f^{-1}( 6) = -3 \).

"\r\n zeroes of the polynomial \( p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 \) are also roots of the polynomial \( q(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 \).

\r\nTo find the zeroes of the polynomial, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of the polynomial \( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) must be a factor of the constant term \( a_0 \) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \( a_n \). For the polynomial \( p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 \), the constant term \( a_0 \) is \(-6\) and the leading coefficient \( a_n \) is \(1\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \).

\r\nWe will test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial \( p(x) \).

\r\n First, let's test \( x = 1 \):
\r\n\[ p(1) = 1^3 + 2(1)^2 - 5(1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 5 - 6 = -8 \]
\r\nSince \( p(1) \neq 0 \), \( x = 1 \) is not a root.

\r\nNext, let's test \( x = -1 \):
\r\n\[ p(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 5 - 6 = 0 \]
\r\nSince \( p(-1) = 0 \), \( x = -1 \) is a root.

\r\nNow, we can use synthetic division to divide \( p(x) \) by \( x + 1 \):
\r\n\r\n\[
\r\n\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
-1 & 1 & 2 & -5 & -6 \\
   &   & -1 & -1 & 6 \\
   \hline
   & 1 & 1 & -6 & 0  \\
\r\n\end{array}
\r\n\r\n
\r\nThe quotient is \( x^2 + x - 6 \), so we have:
\r\n\[ p(x) = (x + 1)(x^2 + x - 6) \]

\r\nNext, we factor the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + x - 6 \):
\r\n\r\n\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \]
\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have:
\r\n\[ p(x) = (x + 1)(x + 3)(x - 2) \]

\r\nThe zeroes of the polynomial are:
\r\n\[ x = -1, x = -3, x = 2 \]

\r\nSince the zeroes of \( p(x) \) are also roots of \( q(x) \), the zeroes of \( q(x) \) are:
\r\n\[ x = -1, x = -3, x = 2 \]

\r\nThus, the zeroes of the polynomial are:

"Given the polynomial function \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we need to determine the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \).

First, we substitute \( x-1 \) into \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
\]

Next, we expand each term separately. Starting with \( (x-1)^4 \):

\[
(x-1)^4 = (x-1)(x-1)(x-1)(x-1) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]

So,

\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
\]

Next, we expand \( (x-1)^2 \ ):

\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

So,

\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5
\]

Now, we expand \( -9(x-1) \):

\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9
\]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
 \]

Thus, the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \) are 3, -12, 23, -31, and 15. Therefore, the answer is:

"1. **Determine the slope of the given line:**
   The equation of the given line is \( y = 2x - 2 \). This is in the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope. Therefore, the slope of the given line is \( m_1 = 2 \).

2. **Determine the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line:**
   The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is:
   \[
   m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1} = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

3. **Form the equation of the line passing through the point \((6,0)\) with slope \(-\frac{1}{2}\):**
   Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( (x_1, y_1) \) is the point \((6,0)\) and \( m \) is the slope \(-\frac{1}{2 }\), we get:
   \[
   y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
   \]

4. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**
   To find the intersection of the lines \( y = 2x - 2 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \), we set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
   \[
   4x - 4 = -x + 6
   \]
   Adding \( x \) to both sides:
   \[
   5x - 4 = 6
   \]
   Adding 4 to both sides:
   \[
   5x = 10
   \]
   Dividing by 5:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

5 . **Find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate:**
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the equation \( y = 2x - 2 \):
   \[
   y = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2
   \]

6. **Determine the length of the perpendicular segment:**
   The coordinates of the intersection point are \((2, 2)\). The distance between the points \((6, 0)\) and \((2, 2)\) can be found using the distance formula:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates \((6, 0)\) and \((2, 2)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}

"Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to determine the values of the symmetric sums \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 +  \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these sums by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. We know that:

\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

 Also, the product of the roots taken three at a time is given by:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can rewrite the above equation as:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} \right) = 0.
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3 } + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} = 0.
\]

Now, we use the identity for the sum of the roots taken two at a time:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0,
\]

\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]

We also know:

\[
(\alpha_1 +  \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

So,

\[
4 = 4 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4),
\]

\[
0 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

\[ 1.82 = 1.24 (1 - e^{-\alpha x}) \]

接下来，我们通过两边同时除以 1.24 来隔离 \( e^{-\alpha x} \)：

\[ \frac{1.82}{1.24} = 1 - e^{-\alpha x} \]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle and \(O\) is the center, we know that \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). This implies that \(OA = OC\) and \(OB = OD\).

We are also given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\). This means that the length of \(AB\) is \(k\) times the length of \(AD\). Let's denote the length of \(AD\) by \(x\). Then the length of \(AB\) is \(kx\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are equal in length. Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AOB\), we can find the length of the diagonal \(AC\):

\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{(kx)^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{k^2x^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{x^2(k^2 + 1)} = x\sqrt{k^2 + 1}

Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), the length of \(OA\) is half  of the length of \(AC\):

\[
OA = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{x\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}

The same argument applies to the diagonal \(BD\), so the length of \(OB\) is also:

6. **Compare the total price of all four options to the price of Sofia:**
   \[
   126.59 \text{ dollars} > 123.45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The total price of all four options is greater than the price of Sofia.
   - Therefore, Sofia is the better option.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Sofia}}
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{\text{Sofia}}\). This means that the total cost of all four options (Solium, Solandh, Solindu, and Solart) is greater than the price of Sofia, making her the better option. The calculations show that the total cost is $126.59, which is more than Sofia's price of $123.45. Therefore, Sofia is the more expensive option.","[Sofia, '\\text{Sofia}']",59,"[59, '59']",False
" cricket player 30 which is 100 runs.

To find the average number of runs scored by each player, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of runs scored by all players.
2. Divide the total number of runs by the total number of players.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of runs scored by all players.**

The runs scored by each group of players are:
- 20 players scored 80 runs each.
- 8 players scored 90 runs each.
- 2 players scored 100 runs each.

So, the total runs scored by the 20 players is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The total runs scored by the 8 players is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The total runs scored by the 2 players is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these together gives the total runs scored by all players:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

**Step 2: Divide the total number of runs by the total  number of players.**

The total number of players is:
\[ 20 + 8 + 2 = 30 \]

So, the average number of runs scored by each player is:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average number of runs scored by each player is \(\boxed{84}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{84}\).``````

"To solve for \( n \) in the given diagram, we need to analyze the relationships between the numbers in the diagram. The diagram shows a grid with numbers in each cell, and we need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions.

The diagram looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to find a relationship between these numbers. Let's consider the sum of the numbers in each row and each column. We will start by summing the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
Next, we sum the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
And the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
 \]

Now, let's sum the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
\]
Next, we sum the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
\]
And the numbers in the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

From the above sums, we can see that the sums of the numbers in each row and each column are consistent. However, we need to find a specific value of \( n \) that satisfies all the conditions. Let's use the fact that the sum of the numbers in the first row and the second row should be equal to the sum of the numbers in the third row. This gives us:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]
So, the value of \( n  \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

To verify, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the diagram and check the sums:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
Sum of the third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

All the sums are equal, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
" lhs (left-hand side) of the equation is \(300^2 + 400^2\).

First, we calculate \(300^2\):
\[
300^2 = 300 \times 300 = 90000
\]

Next, we calculate \(400^2\):
\[
400^2 = 400 \times 400 = 160000
\]

Now, we add these two results together:
\[
300^2 + 400^2 = 90000 + 160000 = 250000
\]

So, the equation is:
\[
x^2 = 250000
\]

To find \(x\), we take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{250000}
\]

We know that:
\[
\sqrt{250000} = 500
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\), which are \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\). These roots satisfy the relation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}  = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), the denominator simplifies to:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).```

" XYZ,xy axes to find the area of the triangle. Let's place the points on the coordinate plane as follows:
- \( D = (0, 0) \)
- \( A = (0, 5) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)

First, we will use the coordinates of the vertices to calculate the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) by breaking it into two triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \).

### Area of \( \triangle ABD \)

The vertices of \( \triangle ABD \) are:
- \( A = (0, 5) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

Using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y _1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 5) + 0(5 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 15 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 = 7.5
\]

### Area of \( \triangle BCD \)

The vertices of \( \triangle BCD \) are:
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

Using the same formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3( -4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right | = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 + 0 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
\]

### Total Area of Quadrilateral \(ABCD\)

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \):

\[
\text{Total Area} = 7.5 + 6 = 13.5
\]

### Area of Triangle \(ABC\)

The vertices of \( \triangle ABC \) are:
- \( A = (0, 5) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)

Using the same formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - (-4)) + 3(-4 - 5) + 0(5 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 27 + 0 \right| = \frac{1 }{2} \times 27 = 13.5
\]

### Area of Triangle \(ACD\)

The vertices of \( \triangle ACD \) are:
- \( A = (0, 5) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

Using the same formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 5) + 0(5 - (-4)) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 0 + 0 \right| = 0
\]

### Area of Triangle \(BCD\)

The vertices of \( \triangle BCD \) are:
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, -4) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

Using the same formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \left|  3(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 + 0 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
\]

### Area of Triangle \(ABD\)

The vertices of \( \triangle ABD \) are:
- \( A = (0, 5) \)
- \( B = (3, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

Using the same formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 5) + 0(5 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 15 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 = 7.5
\]

### Sum of Areas of Triangles \(ACD\), \(BCD\), and \(ABD The final answer is :
