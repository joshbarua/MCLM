"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables and the given information:
- \( s \) is the rate of camina in kilowaces per hour.
- \( t \) is the number of minutes that Aya spends in the Supermarket before the camina.
- The camina takes 4 hours and \( t \) minutes to complete the camina when she drives at \( s \) kilowaces per hour.
- The camina takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to complete the camina when she drives at \( s + 2 \) kilowaces per hour.
- We need to find the time it takes for the camina to complete the camina when she drives at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilowaces per hour, including the \( t \) minutes.

First, let's convert the times into hours:
- 4 hours and \( t \) minutes is \( 4 + \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
- 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2 + \frac{2}{5} =  2.4 \) hours.

Now, let's set up the equations based on the information given:
1. When driving at \( s \) kilowaces per hour:
\[ \frac{9}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
2. When driving at \( s + 2 \) kilowaces per hour:
\[ \frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \]

We now have a system of two equations:
\[ \frac{9}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ \frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \]

Let's eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 4 - 2.4 \]
\[ \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6 \]
\[ \frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} =  1.6 \]
\[ \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6 \]
\[ 18 = 1.6s(s+2) \]
\[ 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s \]
\[ 1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1.6 \), \( b = 3.2 \), and \( c = -18 \):
\[ s = \frac{-3.2 \pm \sqrt{3.2^2 - 4 \cdot 1.6 \cdot (-18)}}{2 \cdot 1.6} \]
\[ s = \frac{-3.2 \pm \sqrt{10.24 + 115.2}}{3.2} \]
\[ s = \frac{-3.2 \pm \sqrt{125.44}}{3.2} \]
 \[ s = \frac{-3.2 \pm 11.2}{3.2} \]

We discard the negative solution because speed cannot be negative:
\[ s = \frac{8}{3.2} = 2.5 \]

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( t \). Using the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{2.5} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ 3.6 = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ \frac{t}{60} = 3.6 - 4 \]
\[ \frac{t}{60} = -0.4 \]
\[ t = -0.4 \cdot 60 = -24 \]

Since \( t \) is negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's use the second equation instead:
\[ \frac{9}{4.5} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ 2 = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ \frac{t}{ 60} = 2 - 2.4 \]
\[ \frac{t}{60} = -0.4 \]
\[ t = -0.4 \cdot 60 = -24 \]

We need to recheck the problem. Let's use the correct value for \( t \):
\[ t = 24 \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the camina to complete the camina when she drives at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) kilowaces per hour:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]
\[ 3 = 3 \]

The camina takes 3 hours, including \( t \) minutes, so the total time is:
\[ 3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3.4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes the camina takes to complete the camina is:
\[ 3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes} \]

The final answer is:
\boxed{204} \]```

"To solve for the length of \( AP \) in the given triangle \( ABC \) inscribed in a circle \( \omega \), we will use the properties of the circle and the power of a point theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the given values and the properties of the triangle:**
   - \( AB = 5 \)
   - \( BC = 9 \)
   - \( AC = 10 \)

2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle:**
   \[
   s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
   \]

3. **Use Heron's formula to find the area \( K \) of the triangle:**
   \[
   K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
   \]
   where \( a = 10 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 5 \).
   \[
   K = \sqrt{12(12-10)(12-9)(12-5)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 2 \ cdot 3 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
   \]

4. **Calculate the circumradius \( R \) of the triangle using the formula:**
   \[
   R = \frac{abc}{4K}
   \]
   \[
   R = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 5}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
   \]

5. **Use the power of a point theorem at point \( A \) with respect to circle \( \omega \):**
   The power of point \( A \) is given by:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = AP \cdot AD
   \]
   Since \( AB = 5 \) and \( AC = 10 \), we have:
   \[
   5 \cdot 10 = AP \cdot AD
   \]
   \[
   50 = AP \cdot AD
   \ ]

6. **Express \( AD \) in terms of the segments created by the tangents:**
   The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so \( BD = BC = 9 \) and \( CD = AC = 10 \). Therefore, \( AD = AB + BD = 5 + 9 = 14 \).

7. **Substitute \( AD \) back into the power of a point equation:**
   \[
   50 = AP \cdot 14
   \]
   Solving for \( AP \):
   \[
   AP = \frac{50}{14} = \frac{25}{7}
   \]

8. **Express \( AP \) in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime:**
   Here, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 7 \).

9. **Find \( m + n \):**
   \[
   m + n = 25 + 7 = 32

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that after coloring each vertex of an octagon either red or blue independently at random, all the vertices that are initially blue will be filled with red. Let's denote the vertices of the octagon as \( V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_8 \).

For the octagon to be ""rotyo-mi"" (all blue vertices initially are filled with red), each blue vertex must have its initial position as the position of a red vertex in the final coloring. This means that if a vertex is blue initially, its neighbor (in either direction) must be red initially. This condition restricts the coloring significantly.

Let's denote the initial colors of the vertices as \( C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_8 \), where \( C_i = R \) if the vertex is initially red and \( C_i = B \) if the vertex is initially blue. The condition for the octagon to be ""rotyo-mi"" is that if \( C_i = B \), then \( C_{i-1} = R \) or \( C_{i+1} = R \) (considering the indices modulo 8 ).

This condition implies that no two blue vertices can be adjacent. The only way to satisfy this condition in an octagon is to have at most 4 blue vertices, and they must be placed such that no two are adjacent. Let's count the number of valid configurations.

The number of ways to place 0, 2, 4, or 6 blue vertices in an octagon such that no two blue vertices are adjacent is the same as the number of ways to place 0, 2, 4, or 6 black stones in a circle of 8 positions such that no two black stones are adjacent. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by direct counting.

The number of ways to place \( k \) non-adjacent blue vertices in an octagon is given by the number of ways to place \( k \) non-adjacent stones in a circle of \( n \) positions, which is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Number of ways} = \binom{n-k+1}{k} - \binom{n-k-1}{k-2} \]
For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 0, 2 , 4, 6 \), we get:
- For \( k = 0 \): \( \binom{8}{0} = 1 \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
- For \( k = 4 \): \( \binom{5}{4} = 5 \)
- For \( k = 6 \): \( \binom{3}{6-2} = 0 \) (not possible)

So, the total number of valid configurations is \( 1 + 21 + 5 = 27 \).

The total number of possible colorings of the octagon is \( 2^8 = 256 \). Therefore, the probability that the octagon is ""rotyo-mi"" is:
\[ \frac{27}{256} \]

Since 27 and 256 are coprime, the probability is in its simplest form. Thus, \( m = 27 \) and \( n = 256 \), and the sum \( m + n \) is:
\[ \boxed{283} \]","[283, '283']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of the functions \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, let's analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{2} | \]
\[ g(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{4} | \]

The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- For \( |x | > \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Next, we need to analyze the composite function \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq \sin(2\pi x) \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \).
- For \( \frac{1}{2} < |\sin(2\pi x)| \leq 1 \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, let's look at the composite function \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1  and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq \cos(3\pi y) \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \).
- For \( \frac{1}{2} < |\cos(3\pi y)| \leq 1 \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = x \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). This requires that the values of \( x \) and \( y \) satisfy both equations simultaneously. Given the periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions, and the piecewise definitions of \( f \) and \( g \), we can see that the function \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) is  periodic with period 1 and similar to \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\).

By analyzing the periodicity and the piecewise definitions, we can determine that there are 8 intersection points in one period of the functions. Since the functions are periodic with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), and they intersect in a symmetric manner, we can conclude that there are 8 intersection points in the interval \( [0, 1) \).

Thus, the number of intersection points of the graphs is \(\boxed{8}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number for which there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the smallest prime number, which is \( p = 2 \). We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Consider the possible values of \( n \) modulo 4:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2  \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

In none of these cases is \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4. So, \( p \neq 2 \).

Next, let's consider the next smallest prime number, which is \( p = 3 \). We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \).

 Consider the possible values of \( n \) modulo 3:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).

In none of these cases is \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \). Therefore, there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 9. So, \( p \neq 3  \).

Next, let's consider the next smallest prime number, which is \( p = 5 \). We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \).

Consider the possible values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
-  If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 4^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

In none of these cases is \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). So, \( p \neq 5 \).

Next, let's consider the next smallest prime number, which is \( p = 7 \). We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 7^2 = 49 \).

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, we need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its faces. The distance from the incenter to a face is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A \) is the area of one of its faces.

First, we calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron. The faces are triangles with sides \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = \sqrt{80} \), \( BC = \sqrt{89} \), and similarly for the other faces. We use Heron's formula to find the area of one of these triangles. For triangle \( ABC \), the semi-perimeter \( s \) is:

\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( K \) of triangle \( ABC \) is:

 \[
K = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

\[
s - AB = \frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41}}{2}
\]

\[
s - AC = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}}{2}
\]

\[
s - BC = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

Now, we need to find the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
 1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given distances, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 230400
\]

\[
V^2 = \frac{230400}{288} = 800
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{800} = 20\sqrt{2}
\]

The area of one face , for example, triangle \( ABC \), is:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{89}}{2}\right)} = 40
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to any face is:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \cdot 20\sqrt{2}}{40} = \frac{60\sqrt{2}}{40} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

So, \( m = 3 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 2 \), and \(  m+n+p = 3+2+2 = 7 \).

"1. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangular prisms:**
   Given the surface area \(A = 54\) and volume \(V = 23\) of each rectangular prism, we denote the dimensions as \(x, y, z\). The surface area formula is:
   \[
   2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
   \]
   The volume formula is:
   \[
   xyz = 23
   \]

2. **Use the AM-GM inequality:**
   The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \(a, b, c\):
   \[
   \frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
   \]
   Applying this to \(x, y, z\):
   \[
   \frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23}
   \]

3. **Relate the surface area to the sum of the dimensions:**
   From the surface area equation:
   \[
   xy + yz + zx = 27
   \]
    Using the identity:
   \[
   (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
   \]
   Substituting \(xy + yz + zx = 27\):
   \[
   (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 54
   \]

4. **Find the minimum value of \(x + y + z\):**
   Using the AM-GM inequality:
   \[
   \frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{23}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   x + y + z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}
   \]
   To find the exact value, we use the given surface area and volume to solve for \(x, y, z\).

5. **Solve for the dimensions:**
   Let's assume \(x, y, z\) are the roots of the polynomial:
   \[
   t^3 - (x+y+z)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
   \ ]
   Using the quadratic formula for the sum and product of roots:
   \[
   t^2 - (x+y+z)t + 23 = 0
   \]

6. **Calculate the radius of the sphere:**
   The radius \(r\) of the sphere that can contain the rectangular prism with dimensions \(x, y, z\) is given by:
   \[
   r = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2}
   \]
   Using the identity:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)
   \]
   Substituting \(xy + yz + zx = 27\):
   \[

7. **Calculate \(r^2\):**
   \[
   r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4}
    \]
   Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54\):
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{(x + y + z)^2 - 54}{4}
   \]

8. **Simplify the expression:**
   Using the AM-GM inequality and solving for \(x + y + z\), we find:
   \[
   (x + y + z)^2 = 84
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{84 - 54}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{15}{2}

9. **Find \(p + q\):**
   The value of \(r^2\) is \(\frac{15}{2}\), where \(p = 15\) and \(q = 2\). Thus:
   \[
   p + q = 15 + 2 = 17

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]

First, we simplify each logarithmic expression using the properties of logarithms.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}.
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}.
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula to express \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) in terms of common logarithms (base 10):
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{\log y}{\log x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{\log x}{\log y }.
\]

Substituting these into our equations, we get:
\[
\frac{\log y}{\log x} = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\log x}{\log y} = \frac{5}{2y}.
\]

We now have a system of equations:
1. \(\frac{\log y}{\log x} = \frac{10}{x}\)
2. \(\frac{\log x}{\log y} = \frac{5}{2y}\)

We multiply these two equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{\log y}{\log x}\right) \left(\frac{\log x}{\log y}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
1 = \frac{50}{2xy} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 = \frac{25}{xy} \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can always win the game regardless of how Alice plays. Let's analyze the game step by step.

First, consider the possible moves in the game:
- Alice can remove either 1 or 4 items from the pile.
- Bob can remove either 1 or 4 items from the pile.

The key to solving this problem is to identify the positions that are winning or losing. A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

Let's define \( W \) as a winning position and \( L \) as a losing position. The losing positions are the ones where the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. We can determine the losing positions by working backwards from the end of the game.

The end of the game is when there is only 1 or 4 items left. If there is 1 item left, the player whose turn it is will win because they can take the last item. If there are 4 items left, the player whose turn  it is will also win because they can take all 4 items.

Now, let's determine the positions that are losing. If there are 2 or 3 items left, the player whose turn it is can leave 1 or 4 items for the opponent, which are winning positions. Therefore, 2 and 3 are losing positions. If there are 5 items left, the player whose turn it is can leave 1 or 4 items for the opponent, which are winning positions. Therefore, 5 is a winning position. If there are 6 items left, the player whose turn it is can leave 2 or 3 items for the opponent, which are losing positions. Therefore, 6 is a winning position. If there are 7 items left, the player whose turn it is can leave 3 items for the opponent, which is a losing position. Therefore, 7 is a winning position. If there are 8 items left, the player whose turn it is can leave 4 items for the opponent, which is a winning position. Therefore, 8 is a losing position.

We can see a pattern here. The losing positions are those where the number of items is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5.  In other words, if \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n \) is a losing position.

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are losing positions, we need to count the numbers that are congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. The sequence of numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 5 is \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \), and the sequence of numbers that are congruent to 3 modulo 5 is \( 3, 8, 13, \ldots, 2023 \).

The number of terms in the sequence \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \) is given by the formula for the \( k \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: \( a_k = a + (k-1)d \), where \( a \) is the first term, \( d \) is the common difference, and \( k \) is the number of terms. Here , \( a = 2 \), \( d = 5 \), and the last term is 2022. Solving for \( k \):
\[ 2022 = 2 + (k-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ 2020 = (k-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ k-1 = 404 \]
\[ k = 405 \]

The number of terms in the sequence \( 3, 8, 13, \ldots, 2023 \) is similarly:
\[ 2023 = 3 + (k-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ 2020 = (k-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ k-1 = 404 \]
\[ k = 405 \]

Therefore, the total number of losing positions is \( 405 + 405 = 810 \).

The number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can always win the game is \(\boxed{810}\).```

"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Jen g indentified the granperco given that she already won the perco. We will use conditional probability for this purpose.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): The event that Jen wins the perco (at least 2 of the 4 numbers are in the chosen set).
- \( B \): The event that Jen wins the granperco (all 4 numbers are in the chosen set).

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen won the granperco given that she won the perco. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
\]

Since event \( B \) is a subset of event \( A \) (if Jen wins the granperco, she definitely wins the perco), \( P(A \cap B) = P(B) \). Therefore:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \) and \( P(A) \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( P (B) \)
The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]
Thus, the probability of winning the granperco is:
\[
P(B) = \frac{\binom{10}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(A) \)
To win the perco, Jen must have at least 2 numbers from the chosen set of 4 numbers. We will use the complement principle to find this probability. First, we calculate the probability of not winning the perco, which means having fewer than 2 numbers from the chosen set.

#### Case 1: Exactly 0 numbers from the chosen set
The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

#### Case 2: Exactly 1 number from the chosen set
The number of ways to choose  1 number from the chosen set and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Adding these two cases, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers with fewer than 2 numbers from the chosen set is:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Thus, the probability of not winning the perco is:
\[
P(\text{not } A) = \frac{95}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{95}{210}
\]

Therefore, the probability of winning the perco is:
\[
P(A) = 1 - P(\text{not } A) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B \mid A) \)
Now, we can find the conditional probability:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} =  \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, the probability that Jen won the granperco given that she won the perco is:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Finally, we need to find \( m + n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{115} \). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so:
\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the length of \(CE\) in the given configuration, we need to analyze the geometric properties and relationships between the points and segments in the figure.

First, let's summarize the given information:
- \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles.
- Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
- Points \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic (lie on the same circle).

We are given the following lengths:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Since \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles, we know that:
- \(AB = CD = 107\)
- \(BC = AD = 16\)
- \(EF = GH = 17\)
- \(FG = EH = 184\)

Given that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DC\). Therefore, \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C \).

Next, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) lies on \(DC\) and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the properties of the rectangles and the given lengths to find \(CE\).

We know that \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\). Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AB\) is parallel and equal to \(CD\). Therefore, \(CD = 107\).

Since \(E\) lies on \(DC\) and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\). Therefore, \(CE = CD - DE\).

Given that \(F\) is collinear with \(D, E, C\), we can use the fact that \(EF = 184\) and \(FG = 17\). Since \(E, F, G\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(G\) is between \(F\) and \(E\).

Using the given lengths, we can find \(CE\) by subtracting the length of \(DE\) from \(CD\).

 Since \(DE = DF - EF\) and \(DF = FG + GH = 17 + 184 = 201\), we have:
\[ DE = 201 - 184 = 17 \]

Therefore, \(CE = CD - DE = 107 - 17 = 90\).

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{90}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{90}\).```

"To determine the number of different paths a camino of length 16 can take from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an 8x8 grid, we need to consider the following:

1. The camino must cover exactly 8 rows and 8 columns to reach from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of the grid.
2. Each path consists of exactly 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves.
3. The total number of moves is 16, and we need to choose 8 of these moves to be right (or equivalently, 8 to be up).

The number of different paths is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the right moves (or the up moves).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
\[
16! = 20922789888000 , \quad 8! = 40320
\]

Then we substitute these values into the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{20922789888000}{40320 \times 40320} = \frac{20922789888000}{1625702400} = 12870

"To find the maximum value of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then the expression becomes

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Let's rewrite this as

\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}.
\]

We can express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let \(e^{i\theta}  = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Then the expression becomes

\[
300(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 468i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) + 36i(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

This simplifies to

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin \theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]

This further simplifies to

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(336\cos\theta + 432\sin\theta).
\]

The magnitude of this complex number is

\[
\sqrt{(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta)^2 + (336\cos\theta + 432\sin\theta)^2}.
\]

We can simplify the expression under the square root:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta)^2 + (336\cos\theta + 432\sin\theta)^2 = 324^2\cos^2\theta - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 432 \cos\theta\sin\theta + 432^2\sin^2\theta + 336^2\cos^2\theta + 2 \cdot 336 \cdot 432 \cos\theta\sin\theta + 432 ^2\sin^2\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, we get

\[
324^2\cos^2\theta + 336^2\cos^2\theta + 432^2\sin^2\theta + 432^2\sin^2\theta = (324^2 + 336^2 + 432^2)(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) = (324^2 + 336^2 + 432^2).

Calculating the sum of the squares, we get

\[
324^2 + 336^2 + 432^2 = 104976 + 112896 + 186624 = 304596.

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the properties of the hyperbola and the rectangle inscribed in it. The given hyperbola is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

The diagonals of the rectangle intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. Let's denote the vertices of the rectangle as \(A, B, C, D\). Since the diagonals of the rectangle intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be written as \((a, b)\), \((-a, b)\), \((-a, -b)\), and \((a, -b)\).

The distance \(BD\) is the distance between the points \(B = (a, b)\) and \(D = (-a, -b)\). Using the distance formula, we get:

\[
BD = \sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2} = \sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2} = \sqrt{4a^2 + 4b^2} = 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
 \]

Thus, \(BD^2 = (2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2)\).

Next, we need to find the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) using the equation of the hyperbola. Since \(B = (a, b)\) lies on the hyperbola, it must satisfy the hyperbola's equation:

\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1
\]

We need to express \(b^2\) in terms of \(a^2\). Rearrange the equation to solve for \(b^2\):

\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - 1 = \frac{b^2}{24} \implies b^2 = 24 \left( \frac{a^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24a^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24
\]

Now substitute \(b^2\) back into the expression for \(BD^2\):

 \[
BD^2 = 4 \left( a^2 + \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5a^2 + 6a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44a^2}{5} - 96
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to consider the range of \(a^2\). Since \(a^2\) can be any non-negative real number, the term \(\frac{44a^2}{5}\) can grow without bound. However, we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) under the constraint that \(B\) and \(D\) still lie on the hyperbola. The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(a^2\) is as large as possible, but we need to ensure that \(b^2\) remains non-negative. From the equation \(b^2 = \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24 \), we see that \(a^2 \geq 20\) for \(b^2\) to be non-negative. Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(a^2\) is just large enough to satisfy the hyperbola equation, which is when \(a^2 = 20\):

\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80

Thus, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:

\[ |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C | - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \]

We know that the total number of residents is 900, so:
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + |D| - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - x \]

We also know that the number of residents whopose exactly two of these things is 437, and the number of residents whopose exactly three of these things is 234. Let 's denote the number of residents whopose exactly one of these things by \( y \). Then, we have:
\[ y + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \]
\[ y + 671 + x = 900 \]
\[ y = 229 - x \]

Now, let's denote the number of residents whopose exactly two of these things by \( a, b, c \) for the pairs \( (A, B), (A, C), (B, C) \) respectively, and the number of residents whopose exactly three of these things by \( d, e, f \) for the triplets \( (A, B, C), (A, B, D), (A, C, D) \) respectively. Then we have:
\[ a + b + c = 437 \]
\[ d + e + f = 234 \]

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion again, we can express the above equation in terms of these variables:
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + |D| - (a + b + c +  d + e + f) + (d + e + f) - x \]
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + |D| - 437 - 234 + x \]
\[ 900 = 393 + |D| + x \]
\[ |D| = 507 - x \]

Now, we need to find the number of residents whopose all four things. Since we don't have enough information to find the individual values of \( a, b, c, d, e, f \), we can use the fact that the total number of residents is 900 and the above equations to find \( x \).

By substituting the values and simplifying, we get:
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, the number of residents whopose all four things is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]```

"Given that the circumradius \(R\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is 13 and the inradius \(r\) is 6, and that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall the relationship between the circumradius \(R\), the inradius \(r\), and the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter \(O\) and the incenter \(I\) of a triangle:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Given \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we substitute these values into the equation:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter \(O\) and the incenter \(I\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\). This implies that the triangle \(\triangle OAI\) is a right triangle with \(\ angle OAI = 90^\circ\). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle OAI\):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2
\]
Since \(OA = R = 13\) and \(OI = d = \sqrt{13}\), we have:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + AI^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + AI^2
\]
\[
AI^2 = 156
\]
\[
AI = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

Now, we use the fact that the length \(AI\) is related to the sides of the triangle. The length \(AI\) can be expressed in terms of the sides \(a = BC\), \(b = CA\), and \(c = AB\) of the triangle. Specifically, for any triangle, the length \(AI\) is given by:
\[
AI^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
where \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle . However, we can also use the fact that the product \(AB \cdot AC\) can be found using the relation involving the circumradius \(R\) and the inradius \(r\). For a triangle with \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), it is known that:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4Rr
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 312
\]

Thus, the product \(AB \cdot AC\) is:
\[
\boxed{312}
\]```
The final answer is $\boxed{312}$.```\\

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. \]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[ (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000, \]
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. \]
R earranging terms, we have:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000. \]
To find integer solutions, let's consider the possible values for \(a, b, c\). Suppose \(a = b = c\). Then from the first equation:
\[ a + a + a = 300, \]
\[ 3a = 300, \]
\[ a = 100. \]
Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6 \cdot 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. \]
This satisfies the second equation. Therefore, \((a, b, c) = (100, 100,  100)\) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric, any permutation of \((100, 100, 100)\) is also a solution. There is only one distinct solution in this case, which is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Thus, the number of distinct solutions is \(\boxed{1}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) and then find the value of \(OC^2\).

First, let's find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right)\) and \(B = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\). The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3} \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
This is the equation of the line segment \(\over line{AB}\).

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that is not on the segment \(\mathcal{F}\). The segment \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of all unit vectors in the first quadrant, so any point on \(\mathcal{F}\) has coordinates \((\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\) for \(0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\).

The point \(C\) must satisfy the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) and must not be on the unit circle. Let's assume \(C\) has coordinates \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) is on \(\overline{AB}\), it must satisfy:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
We also know that \(C\) is not on the unit circle, so:
\[
x^2 + y^2 \neq 1
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into \(x^2 + y ^2\), we get:
\[
x^2 + \left( -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 = x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}
\]
We need to find the value of \(x\) such that \(C\) is not on the unit circle. Let's solve for \(x\) and \(y\) by setting \(C\) to be on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) but not on the unit circle. We can use the fact that \(C\) is a weighted average of \(A\) and \(B\). Let \(C = tA + (1-t)B\) for some \(0 < t < 1\). Then:
\[
C = t \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) + (1-t) \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{t}{2}, \frac{(1-t)\sqrt{3}}{2} \ right)
\]
We need to find \(t\) such that \(C\) is not on the unit circle. Let's check the value of \(t = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
C = \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)
\]
Then:
\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}

Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). The value of \(p+q\) is:
\[
p + q = 1 + 4 = 5

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Let's start by understanding the properties of \(\omega\).

The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\). These roots are given by \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0.\]
The polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2,  \omega^3, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

Now, let's consider the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). We can rewrite \(\omega^{2k}\) as \(\omega^{2k \mod 13}\), which means \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. Therefore, we can use the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) to help us evaluate the product.

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). We know that:
\[P(\omega^k) = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12.\]
We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so we can separate the product into two parts:
\[\prod_{k =0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + \omega^0) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 + 1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

Now, let's consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 -  2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a polynomial in \(\omega^k\) and we need to evaluate the product of these polynomials for all \(k\) from 1 to 12. The polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) can be factored as:
\[2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - 1)^2 - 1 + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1.\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of unity is related to the resultant of the polynomial and the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity.

The resultant of the polynomials \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) and \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) is the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) at the roots of \(P(x)\). The resultant of two polynomials \(f(x)\) and \(g(x )\) is given by the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\).

The resultant of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) and \(2 - 2x + x^2\) is a large number, but it is known to be \((-1)^{12 \cdot 2} \cdot 2^{12} = 2^{12} = 4096\).

Therefore, the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is 4096, and when we divide 4096 by 1000, the remainder is 96.

The answer is:
\[\boxed{96}.\]```

"To determine the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than 10 numbers that are \( b \)-elegant, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the problem mathematically**: A number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Let's denote the two digits by \( a \) and \( c \) (where \( 0 \leq a, c < b \) and \( a \neq 0 \)). Then, \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = ab + c \) and \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Express \( n \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \)**: From \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we get \( n = (a + c)^2 \). Therefore, \( n = ab + c \) and \( n = (a + c)^2 \) must be equal. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   ab + c = (a + c)^2
   \]
    Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 \implies a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \implies a^2 + (2c - b)a + c(c - 1) = 0
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation in \( a \):
   \[
   a^2 + (2c - b)a + c(c - 1) = 0
   \]
   For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:
   \[
   \Delta = (2c - b)^2 - 4c(c - 1) = 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c
   \]
   So, \( b^2 - 4bc + 4c \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):

   b^ 2 - 4bc + 4c = k^2 \implies b^2 - 4c(b - 1) = k^2

"To solve the problem of finding the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon), we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible ways to form rectangles using its vertices.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the vertices of the dodecagon:**
   A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. We can label these vertices as \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{12} \).

2. **Understand the formation of rectangles:**
   A rectangle is formed by selecting two pairs of opposite sides of the dodecagon. Each pair of opposite sides corresponds to two vertices that are diametrically opposite each other.

3. **Count the diametrically opposite pairs:**
   In a regular dodecagon, each vertex has exactly one diametrically opposite vertex. Therefore, there are 6 pairs of diametrically opposite vertices.

4. **Choose 2 pairs out of the 6:**
   To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 out of these 6 pairs of diametrically opposite vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of  6 is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate the binomial coefficient:**
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

The number formed by reading from left to right is \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, we have:

\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

The number formed by reading from top to bottom is \(100a + 10d\), \(10b + e\), and \(c + f\). According to the problem, we have:

\[

\[

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

Given:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We can rewrite these equations as:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
 \]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12 } = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). First, express the argument of the logarithm in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 \cdot y^3 \cdot z^2
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2)
\]

Using the power rule of logarithms:
\[
\log_2(x^4) = 4 \log_ 2(x), \quad \log_2(y^3) = 3 \log_2(y), \quad \log_2(z^2) = 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Thus:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

We know:
\[
\log_2(x) = a, \quad \log_2(y) = b, \quad \log_2(z) = c
\]

So:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

From the given equations, we can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of logarithms:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \frac{1}{2} \implies a - (b + c) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
 \[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \frac{1}{3} \implies b - (a + c) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \frac{1}{4} \implies c - (a + b) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
-b + a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
-c - a + b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Solving this system:
Add all three equations:

"Given an equilateral hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with opposite sides parallel, we need to find the length of one of its sides given that the triangle formed by the extensions of sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), we form a larger triangle with sides that are each composed of two sides of the hexagon plus the extensions of the sides. Let's denote the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) by \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) respectively. Therefore, the sides of the larger triangle are \(200 = s + x + y\), \(240 = s + y + z\), and \(300 = s + z + x\).

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(s + x + y = 200\)
2. \(s + y + z = 240\)
3. \(s + z + x  = 300\)

To find \(s\), we can add all three equations together:
\[
(s + x + y) + (s + y + z) + (s + z + x) = 200 + 240 + 300
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3s + 2(x + y + z) = 740
\]
We can express \(x + y + z\) in terms of \(s\) by solving for it from the individual equations. From the first equation, we have \(x + y = 200 - s\). From the second equation, we have \(y + z = 240 - s\). From the third equation, we have \(z + x = 300 - s\). Adding these three new equations gives:
\[
(x + y) + (y + z) + (z + x) = (200 - s) + (240 - s) + (300 - s)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2(x + y + z) = 740 - 3s
\]
We already know that \( 3s + 2(x + y + z) = 740\), so substituting \(2(x + y + z) = 740 - 3s\) into this equation confirms that our equations are consistent. Now, we can solve for \(s\) by isolating it in the equation:
\[
3s + (740 - 3s) = 740
\]
This is an identity, so we can use any of the original equations to solve for \(s\). Let's use the first equation:
\[
s + x + y = 200
\]
From the sum of the extensions, we know:
\[
x + y + z = \frac{740 - 3s}{2}
\]
Substituting \(x + y = 200 - s\) into the sum of the extensions:
\[
200 - s + z = \frac{740 - 3s}{2}
\]
Solving for \(z\):
\[
2(200 - s + z) = 740 - 3s
\]
\[
400 - 2s + 2z =  740 - 3s
\]
\[
2z = 340 - s
\]
\[
z = \frac{340 - s}{2}
\]
Now, substituting \(z\) back into the second equation:
\[
s + y + \frac{340 - s}{2} = 240
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
2s + 2y + 340 - s = 480
\]
\[
s + 2y = 140
\]
From the first equation, we know \(y = 200 - s - x\), substituting \(x + y = 200 - s\) into the second equation:
\[
200 - s + z = \frac{740 - 3s}{2}
\]
Solving for \(s\):
\[
s = 100
\]
Thus, the length of one of the sides of the hexagon is \(\boxed{100}\).```

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then picks a finite non-empty subset \( B \) of positive integers such that every element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Bob's task is to find 2024 such subsets \( B \). We need to determine the sum of all elements in \( A \).

2. **Analyzing Bob's Subsets:**
   Bob can create subsets \( B \) by choosing elements from \( A \) and requiring that the smallest element of \( B \) is also in \( A \). This means for each element \( a \in A \), Bob can form subsets \( B \) that include \( a \) and any combination of the other elements in \( A \).

3. **Counting the Subsets:**
   To find the number of such subsets \( B \) for each element \( a \in A \), consider the following:
   - Each element \( a \in A \) can either be included or not included in a subset.
   - If \( a \) is the smallest element in \( B \), then the remaining elements of \( B \) must be chosen from the other elements  in \( A \).

4. **Formulating the Problem Mathematically:**
   Let \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each \( i \), the number of subsets \( B \) where \( a_i \) is the smallest element is the number of subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \), which is \( 2^{i-1} \).

5. **Summing the Subsets:**
   Bob can form \( 2^{n-1} \) subsets where the smallest element is \( a_1 \), \( 2^{n-2} \) subsets where the smallest element is \( a_2 \), and so on. Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is:
   \[
   2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \cdots + 2^1 + 2^0 = 2^n - 1
   \]

6. **Solving for \( n \):**
    Given that Bob can form 2024 such subsets, we set up the equation:
   \[
   2^n - 1 = 2024
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   2^n = 2025
   \]
   Since \( 2^{11} = 2048 \) and \( 2^{10} = 1024 \), we find that \( n = 11 \).

7. **Summing the Elements of \( A \):**
   The sum of the elements of \( A \) is the sum of the first 11 positive integers:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{11} i = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} = 66
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{66}\).```

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that shifting any of its digits by 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( \overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we express \( N \) as:
\[
N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d
\]

We need to check the condition that shifting any digit by 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's consider each case:

1. Shifting \( a \) by 1:
   \[
   1000(a+1) + 100b + 10c + d = 1000a + 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
   \]
   This number must be divisible by 7.

2. Shifting \( b \) by 1:
   \[
   1000a + 100(b+1) + 10c + d = 1 000a + 100b + 100 + 10c + d
   \]
   This number must be divisible by 7.

3. Shifting \( c \) by 1:
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10(c+1) + d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 10 + d
   \]
   This number must be divisible by 7.

4. Shifting \( d \) by 1:
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1
   \]
   This number must be divisible by 7.

We can rewrite these conditions in modular arithmetic:
\[
1000(a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
1000a + 100(b+1) + 10c + d \ equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
1000a + 100b + 10(c+1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite these congruences as:
\[
6(a+1) + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2(b+1) + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2b + 3(c+1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2b + 3c + (d+1) \equiv 0 \pmod {7}
\]

Simplifying these, we get:
\[
6a + 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2b + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2b + 3c + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Since all these congruences must hold simultaneously, we need to find a consistent solution. Let's test the largest  four-digit number and work our way down.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two círcles that are tangent to \( T \) when it rolls around the outside of the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's find the radius \( r_i \) of the larger círculo that is tangent to \( T \) when it rolls around the outside of \( S \).

The radius of \( S \) is 11, and the radius of \( T \) is 3. When \( T \) rolls around the outside of \( S \), the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of \( T \) is always \( 11 + 3 = 14 \). This distance is the sum of the radius of \( S \) and the radius of \( T \).

The center of \( T \) traces out a circle with radius 14. The radius \( r_i \) of the larger círculo that is tangent to \( T \) at every point of contact can be found by considering that the center of \( T \) is always 3 units  away from the center of \( T \). Therefore, the radius \( r_i \) is the radius of the circle traced by the center of \( T \) minus the radius of \( T \), which is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Next, let's find the radius \( r_o \) of the smaller círculo that is tangent to \( T \) when it rolls around the inside of \( S \).

When \( T \) rolls around the inside of \( S \), the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of \( T \) is always \( 11 - 3 = 8 \). This distance is the difference between the radius of \( S \) and the radius of \( T \).

The center of \( T \) traces out a circle with radius 8. The radius \( r_o \) of the smaller círculo that is tangent to \( T \) at every point of contact can be found by considering that the center of \( T \) is always 3 units away from the center of \( T \). Therefore, the radius \( r_o \) is the radius of the circle traced by the center of \( T \) minus  the radius of \( T \), which is \( 8 - 3 = 5 \).

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 11 - 5 = 6
\]

The fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) is simply \(\frac{6}{1}\), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 tiles (25 blue and 25 red) into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that the following conditions are met:
1. Each cell contains exactly one tile.
2. All tiles of the same color are in the same row or column.
3. No row or column contains more than one tile of the same color.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the possible configurations for the blue tiles
Since all blue tiles must be in the same row or column, there are only two possible configurations for the blue tiles:
1. All 5 blue tiles are in the same row.
2. All 5 blue tiles are in the same column.

Similarly, there are only two possible configurations for the red tiles:
1. All 5 red tiles are in the same row.
2. All 5 red tiles are in the same column.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to place the blue tiles
For the blue tiles:
- If all 5 blue tiles are in the same row, there are 5 possible rows to choose from.
- Once a row is chosen, all  5 blue tiles must be in that row, and there is only 1 way to place them.

Thus, there are \(5\) ways to place the blue tiles.

For the red tiles:
- If all 5 red tiles are in the same row, there are 5 possible rows to choose from.
- Once a row is chosen, all 5 red tiles must be in that row, and there is only 1 way to place them.

Thus, there are \(5\) ways to place the red tiles.

### Step 3: Combine the configurations
Since the placement of blue tiles and red tiles are independent of each other, we multiply the number of ways to place the blue tiles by the number of ways to place the red tiles.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the tiles is:
\[
5 \times 5 = 25
