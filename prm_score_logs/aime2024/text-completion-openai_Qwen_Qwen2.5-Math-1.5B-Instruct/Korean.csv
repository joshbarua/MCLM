"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- \( s \) is the number of minutes per minute for the second task.
- \( t \) is the time in minutes for the first task.

The first piece of information tells us that if the second task is done for \( s \) minutes per minute, then the first task takes \( t \) minutes, and together they take 4 hours (240 minutes). This can be written as:
\[ s \cdot t = 240. \]

The second piece of information tells us that if the second task is done for \( s + 2 \) minutes per minute, then the first task takes \( t \) minutes, and together they take 4 hours and 24 minutes (264 minutes). This can be written as:
\[ (s + 2) \cdot t = 264. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( s \cdot t = 240 \)
2. \( (s + 2) \cdot t = 264 \)

We can solve the first equation for \( t \):
 \[ t = \frac{240}{s}. \]

Substitute this expression for \( t \) into the second equation:
\[ (s + 2) \cdot \frac{240}{s} = 264. \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 240 + \frac{480}{s} = 264. \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ \frac{480}{s} = 24. \]

Multiply both sides by \( s \):
\[ 480 = 24s. \]

Divide both sides by 24:
\[ s = 20. \]

Now substitute \( s = 20 \) back into the expression for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{240}{20} = 12. \]

So, the second task is done for 20 minutes per minute and the first task takes 12 minutes. Now we need to find out how long the first task takes if the second task is done for \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 20.5 \) minutes per minute.  Using the same first equation \( s \cdot t = 240 \), we substitute \( s = 20.5 \):
\[ 20.5 \cdot t = 240. \]

Solve for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{240}{20.5} = \frac{2400}{205} = \frac{480}{41} \approx 11.71 \text{ minutes}. \]

Therefore, the first task takes \(\frac{480}{41}\) minutes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{480}{41}}. \]```

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we will use the properties of the circumcircle and the power of a point theorem.

First, we need to find the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\). We use the formula for the circumradius \(R\) of a triangle:

\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K}
\]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle, and \(K\) is the area of the triangle. We can find the area \(K\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is given by:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

The area \(K\) is then:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3  \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

Now, we can find the circumradius \(R\):

\[
R = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Next, we use the power of a point theorem. The power of point \(A\) with respect to the circumcircle is given by:

\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(A\) to the circumcircle at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) lies on the line \(BC\) and \(AD\) is the symmedian of triangle \(ABC\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the symmedian:

\[
AD = \frac{2AB \cdot AC \cdot BC}{AB^ 2 + AC^2 - BC^2} = \frac{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 \cdot 9}{5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2} = \frac{900}{25 + 100 - 81} = \frac{900}{44} = \frac{450}{22} = \frac{225}{11}
\]

Now, we can find \(AP\) using the power of a point theorem:

\[
AP \cdot AD = 50 \implies AP \cdot \frac{225}{11} = 50 \implies AP = \frac{50 \cdot 11}{225} = \frac{550}{225} = \frac{22}{9}
\]

Thus, the value of \(AP\) is \(\frac{22}{9}\), and \(m + n = 22 + 9 = 31\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number of the form \( n^4 + 1 \).

First, let's analyze the given condition \( p = n^4 + 1 \). We need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

We start by considering the properties of \( p \). Since \( p = n^4 + 1 \), \( p \) is an odd prime because \( n^4 \) is always even for even \( n \) and odd for odd \( n \), and adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number.

Next, we need to find \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies:
\[
m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}
\]

We will test small values of \( m \) to find the smallest \( m \) that satisfies this congruence.

 1. **Testing \( m = 1 \):**
   \[
   1^4 + 1 = 2
   \]
   Since \( p \) is an odd prime, \( p^2 \) is also odd, and 2 is not divisible by \( p^2 \). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) does not work.

2. **Testing \( m = 2 \):**
   \[
   2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17
   \]
   Again, 17 is not divisible by \( p^2 \) (since \( p \) is odd). Therefore, \( m = 2 \) does not work.

3. **Testing \( m = 3 \):**
   \[
   3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82
   \]
   82 is not divisible by \( p^2 \). Therefore, \( m = 3 \) does not work.

4. **Testing \( m = 4 \):**
   \[
   4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257
    \]
   257 is an odd prime, and \( 257^2 = 66049 \). Since \( 257 \) is a prime of the form \( n^4 + 1 \) (with \( n = 2 \)), we need to check if \( 257 \) divides \( 4^4 + 1 \). Clearly, \( 4^4 + 1 = 257 \), which is divisible by \( 257 \). Therefore, \( m = 4 \) works.

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]```python
```
The final answer is \( \boxed{4} \). This is the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p = n^4 + 1 \). This result is obtained by testing small values of \( m \) and finding that \( m = 4 \) satisfies the condition.","[4, '4']",110,"[110, '110']",False

   \tan \angle BAD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\cos^2 \angle BAD} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{(\sqrt{41} \cdot \sqrt{89})^2}{25^2} - 1}

"1. Let the base of the regular pyramid be a regular polygon with $n$ sides and each side of length $r$. The height of the pyramid is $h$.

The slant height of the pyramid (the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, the apothem of the base, and the slant height. The apothem of a regular polygon with $n$ sides and side length $r$ is given by:

"Given that \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct values such that \( x > 1 \) and \( y > 1 \), and the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) are satisfied, we need to find the value of \( xy \).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

1. Consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\):
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]
Thus:
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

 2. Now consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\):
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]
Using the same property of logarithms, we get:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]
Using the result from the first equation, \(\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\), we substitute it into the second equation:
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \left( \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \right)
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]
Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \( x > 1  \)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now, we need to find \( xy \):
\[
xy = x \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = 25

Thus, the value of \( xy \) is:

The final answer is \( \boxed{25} \). This is obtained by substituting \( y = \frac{25}{x} \) into \( xy \) and simplifying.

The game involves removing either 1 or 4 tiles on each turn. The player who takes the last tile wins. We need to determine the values of \( n \) for which the second player can always win, given that the initial number of tiles is 2024.

First, let's identify the losing positions. A losing position is one where the player whose turn it is cannot force a win. If the player is left with a certain number of tiles, they can only leave the opponent with a different number of tiles. The losing positions are the ones where the opponent can always force a win.

If the first player takes 1 tile, the second player is left with \( n-1 \) tiles. If the first player takes 4 tiles, the second player is left with \( n-4 \) tiles. The second player can force a win if they can leave the first player with a losing position. Therefore, we need to find the losing positions.

Let's  denote the losing positions by \( L \). A position \( L \) is a losing position if the only moves from \( L \) lead to a winning position. So, if the first player is left with a losing position, they cannot win. The first player can win if they can leave the second player with a losing position. Therefore, the losing positions are those where the second player can always force a win.

We can start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is cannot make a move and loses. So, \( n = 0 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 1 \), the first player takes the last tile and wins. So, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 2 \), the first player takes 1 tile and leaves 1 tile for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 3 \), the first player takes 1 tile and leaves 2 tiles for the second player, who then loses. So, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n  = 4 \), the first player can take all 4 tiles and win. So, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 5 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 4 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 5 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 6 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 5 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 7 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 6 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 8 \), the first player can take 4 tiles and leave 4 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 9 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 8 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
 - If \( n = 10 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 9 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 10 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 11 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 10 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 11 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 12 \), the first player can take 4 tiles and leave 8 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 12 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 13 \), the first player can take 1 tile and leave 12 tiles for the second player, who then wins. So, \( n = 13 \) is a winning position.

From the above analysis, we can see that the losing positions are those where \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). This is because if \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), the first player can only leave a number of tiles that is not equivalent to 2 modulo  5, and the second player can always force a win.

Given that the initial number of tiles is 2024, we check the congruence:
\[ 2024 \div 5 = 404 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
So, \( 2024 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

Since 2024 is not a losing position, the first player can always force a win if the number of tiles is not of the form \( 5k + 2 \). Therefore, the number of tiles must be such that the first player can always win, and the number of tiles is 2024.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{2024}

"1. **Picking 4 numbers from the set \( S \):**
   - The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) is given by the binomial coefficient:
     \[
     \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
     \]

2. **Case 1: Two of the selected numbers are larger than 6 and two are less than 6:**
   - The numbers less than 6 are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) and the numbers greater than 6 are \( \{7, 8, 9, 10\} \).
   - The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 numbers less than 6 is:
     \[
     \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{ 2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
     \]
   - The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the 4 numbers greater than 6 is:
     \[
     \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers such that two are greater than 6 and two are less than 6 is:
     \[
     10 \times 6 = 60
     \]

3. **Case 2: All selected numbers are either less than 6 or all greater than 6:**
   - If all 4 numbers are less than 6, the numbers are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 5 is:
     \[
     \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5 
     \]
   - If all 4 numbers are greater than 6, the numbers are \( \{7, 8, 9, 10\} \). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 4 is:
     \[
     \binom{4}{4} = \frac{4!}{4!(4-4)!} = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers such that all are either less than 6 or all greater than 6 is:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6
     \]

4. **Total number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the outcomes from both cases:
     \[
     60 + 6 = 66
     \]

5. **Probability calculation:**
   - The probability that the two largest numbers are larger than 6 and the two smallest numbers are less than 6 is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{210} = \frac{2}{7}
     \]
   - The probability that all numbers are either less than 6 or all numbers are greater than  6 is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{210} = \frac{1}{35}
     \]

6. **Combining the probabilities:**
   - The total probability is the sum of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{2}{7} + \frac{1}{35} = \frac{10}{35} + \frac{1}{35} = \frac{11}{35}
     \]

7. **Finding \( m \) and \( n \):**
   - Here, \( m = 11 \) and \( n = 35 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
     \[
     m + n = 11 + 35 = 46

"1. **Identify the total number of moves required:**
   - The problem states that the minimum number of moves required to go from the bottom-left corner (A1) to the top-right corner (H8) of an 8x8 chessboard is 16 moves.

2. **Determine the nature of the moves:**
   - Each move must be either to the right or up.
   - To move from A1 to H8, we need to move 7 steps right and 7 steps up.

3. **Calculate the number of distinct paths:**
   - The problem is a classic combinatorial problem where we need to find the number of ways to arrange 7 right moves (R) and 7 up moves (U) in a sequence of 14 moves.
   - This can be represented as the number of ways to choose 7 positions out of 14 for the right moves (the remaining positions will automatically be for the up moves).

4. **Use the binomial coefficient:**
   - The number of ways to choose 7 positions out of 14 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{14}{7}\).
   - The binomial coefficient \(\bin om{n}{k}\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
   - Substituting \(n = 14\) and \(k = 7\):
     \[
     \binom{14}{7} = \frac{14!}{7!7!}
     \]

5. **Calculate the factorials:**
   - \(14! = 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\)
   - \(7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\)
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \binom{14}{7} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{7 \times 6  \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}

6. **Perform the division:**
   - Calculate the numerator and the denominator separately:
     \[
     14 \times 13 = 182
     \]
     \[
     182 \times 12 = 2184
     \]
     \[
     2184 \times 11 = 24024
     \]
     \[
     24024 \times 10 = 240240

     \[
     240240 \times 9 = 2162160

     \[
     2162160 \times 8 = 17297280

     \[
     42 \times 5 = 210

     \[
     210 \times 4 = 840

     2520 \times 2 = 5040
     \]
     \[
     5040 \times 1 = 5040
     \]
   - Now divide the numerator by the denominator:

"Given that \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the real part of the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

First, let's express \( z \) in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \(\theta\). The complex conjugate of \( z \) is \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

The magnitude of \( z \) is given by \( |z| = 4 \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) into the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z } = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta}
\]
\[
(96 + 144i) \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, combine the terms:

\[
300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}
\]

Recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Substitute these into the expression:

\[
300(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)  + 468i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) + 36i(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Distribute the constants:

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

Combine the real and imaginary parts:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Simplify the real and imaginary parts:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(360\sin\theta + 492\cos \theta)
\]

The real part of the expression is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To find the maximum value of the real part, we note that the expression \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) can be written in the form \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \).

Calculate \( R \):

\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the real part of the expression is bounded by \( -540 \leq 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \leq 540 \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is:

"The given hyperbola is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The standard form of a hyperbola is \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), where \( a^2 = 20 \) and \( b^2 = 24 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \) and \( b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6} \).

For a hyperbola, the distance between the vertices is \( 2a \) and the distance between the foci is \( 2c \), where \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{20 + 24} = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11} \).

The vertices of the hyperbola are at \( (\pm 2\sqrt{5}, 0) \) and the foci are at \( (\pm 2\sqrt{11}, 0) \).

The problem  asks for the maximum value of \( BD^2 \) where \( B \) and \( D \) are points on the hyperbola such that the product of the distances from the origin to these points is maximized. The maximum value of \( BD^2 \) occurs when \( B \) and \( D \) are at the same distance from the origin and on opposite sides of the hyperbola.

我们假设没有重叠的部分（即，没有一个人同时属于多组），来计算总人口。然后我们减去重叠的部分（即，将 repeatedly 前面的总和减去，直到所有重叠都被减去）。

1. 计算所有 population 的总和：
\[ 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 + 234 = 1795. \ ]

2. 由于“F”组中有900个 population 的人是“A”，“B”，“C”，“D”和“E”组的一部分，我们需要从“F”的总和中减去这些重叠的部分。但是，由于没有给出确切的重叠信息，我们需要假设重叠部分的总和已经包含在“F”的总和中。

因此，Aimeville的总人口是：
\[ 1795 - 900 = 895. \]

所以，Aimeville的总人口是 \(\boxed{895}\). \] 
```
The final answer is \(\boxed{895}\). \] 
``` After adding the solutions, we notice that the provided solutions are incorrect. Let's solve the problem step by step correctly.

1. We are given the number of people in each subset of the population. We need to find the total population of Aimeville.

2. Let's denote the total population of Aimeville as \( P \).

3. We know the following:
   - The population of subset \( A \) is 195.
   - The population of subset \( B \) is 36","[895, '895']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and the incenter of a triangle, as well as the given perpendicularity condition. Let's proceed step-by-step.

1. **Identify the given information and relationships:**
   - \(O\) is the centroid of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\).
   - The length of the median from \(A\) to the midpoint of \(BC\) is 13.
   - The length of the angle bisector from \(A\) to \(BC\) is 6.

2. **Use the properties of the centroid and the incenter:**
   - The centroid \(O\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1.
   - The incenter \(I\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
   - Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the triangle is a right triangle at \(A\) in the context of the centroid and incenter properties.

3. **Apply the median length formula:**
   - The length of the median from  vertex \(A\) to the midpoint of \(BC\) is given by:
     \[
     m_a = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}
     \]
   - Given \(m_a = 13\), we have:
     \[
     13 = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}
     \]
     \[
     26 = \sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}
     \]
     \[
     676 = 2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2
     \]
     \[
     338 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{a^2}{2} \quad \text{(1)}
     \]

4. **Apply the angle bisector length formula:**
   - The length of the angle bisector from vertex \(A\) to \(BC\) is given by:
     \[
     l_a = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2}  \right)
     \]
   - Given \(l_a = 6\), we have:
     \[
     6 = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
     \]

5. **Use the perpendicularity condition:**
   - Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we can use the fact that in a right triangle formed by the centroid and incenter, the product of the segments of the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the legs.
   - This gives us a relationship between the sides of the triangle.

6. **Calculate \(AB \cdot AC\):**
   - From the given information and the properties of the triangle, we can use the fact that the product of the segments of the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the legs.
   - Therefore, \(AB \cdot AC = 168\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}

"To solve the problem, we start by examining the given equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

First, we recognize that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity for the sum of symmetric products of three variables. Specifically, we have:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc
\]

Substituting the value of \(a + b + c\) from the first equation, we get:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc
\]

We know from the problem statement that this expression equals 6,000,000, so we can write:

\[
300(ab + bc  + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000
\]

To find a solution, we can try some simple values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Suppose \(a = b = c\). Then from the first equation, we have:

\[
a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100
\]

So, \(a = b = c = 100\). Now, we substitute these values into the second equation:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot  100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6 \cdot 1,000,000 = 6,000,000
\]

This satisfies the second equation. Therefore, the values \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) are a solution. The product \(abc\) is:

\[
abc = 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 1,000,000
\]

Thus, the product of the integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the given conditions is:

"1. **Identify the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):**
   - \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\)
   - \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\)

2. **Determine the coordinates of point \(C\):**
   - Given that \(C\) is different from \(A\) and \(B\) and lies on line segment \(\overline{AB}\), we need to find the equation of line \(\overline{AB}\).
   - The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
     \[
     m = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(A\):
     \[
     y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}(x - \frac{1}{2}) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2 }
     \]
   - Since \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), its coordinates can be expressed as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\) for some \(x\) in the interval \(\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)\).

3. **Find the midpoint \(M\) of \(\overline{PQ}\):**
   - Let \(P = (x_1, -\sqrt{3}x_1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\) and \(Q = (x_2, -\sqrt{3}x_2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\).
   - The midpoint \(M\) is:
     \[
     M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{-\sqrt{3}x_1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \sqrt{3}x_2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, -\sqrt{3}\left (\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance \(OC\):**
   - The coordinates of \(C\) are \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\).
   - The distance \(OC\) is:
     \[
     OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the square root:
     \[
     OC = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4 }}
     \]

5. **Minimize \(OC^2\):**
   - We need to minimize \(OC^2\):
     \[
     OC^2 = x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4} = 4x^2 - 3x\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4}
     \]
   - Let \(f(x) = 4x^2 - 3x\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4}\).
   - To find the minimum, take the derivative and set it to zero:
     \[
     f'(x) = 8x - 3\sqrt{3} = 0 \implies x = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}
     \]

6. **Evaluate \(OC^2\) at \(x = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\):**
   - Substitute \(x = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\) into \(f(x)\):
     \[
     f\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) = 4\left (\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 - 3\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4}
     \]
     \[
     = 4 \cdot \frac{27}{64} - \frac{27}{8} + \frac{3}{4}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{108}{64} - \frac{216}{64} + \frac{48}{64}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{108 - 216 + 48}{64} = \frac{-60}{64} = \frac{3}{16}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{3}{16}\).
   - The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 3 and 16 respectively.
   - Thus, \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"Given that \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\).

First, recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\). These roots are given by:
\[
\omega^k = e^{2\pi i k / 13} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12
\]
and satisfy the polynomial equation:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = 0
\]
This can be factored as:
\[
(x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0
\]
Since \(\omega \neq 1\), \(\omega\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product :
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2\). Therefore, the expression inside the product becomes:
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2
\]

Let \(y = \omega^k\). Then the expression simplifies to:
\[
2 - 2y + y^2
\]

We need to evaluate:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2y_k + y_k^2)
\]
where \(y_k = \omega^k\).

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of \(P(x)\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can write:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{ 12})
\]

We are interested in the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k)
\]

Notice that \(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\). We need to evaluate:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2)
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Since \(\omega^{13} = 1\), we have \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, the product becomes:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Consider the polynomial \(R(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and its derivative \(R'(x) = 13x^{12}\).  By the properties of roots of unity and symmetric functions, we know that the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) at the roots of unity is related to the resultant of the polynomials \(Q(x)\) and \(R(x)\).

The resultant of two polynomials \(Q(x)\) and \(R(x)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Res}(Q, R) = \prod_{i=1}^n Q(\alpha_i)
\]
where \(\alpha_i\) are the roots of \(R(x)\).

Given that \(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\) and \(R(x) = x^{13} - 1\), the resultant is:
\[
\text{Res}(x^2 - 2x + 2, x^{13} - 1)
\]

The resultant of \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) and \(x^{13} - 1\) is the product of the values of \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) at the roots of \(x^{13} - 1\), which are the 13th roots of unity.

Thus, the product  is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\] 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]

"1. 我们需要找到一个整数 \( b \geq 2 \) 使得 \( b \)-eualient number \( n \) can be represented by a number with exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).
2. Let's denote the two digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( a \) and \( d \) where \( 0 \leq a, d < b \). The number \( n \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   n = ab + d
   \]
3. According to the problem, the sum of the digits \( a \) and \( d \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \):
   \[
   a + d = \sqrt{n}
   \]
4. Substituting \( n = ab + d \) into the equation \( a + d = \sqrt{n} \), we get:
   \[
   a + d = \sqrt{ab + d}
   \]
5. Squaring both sides, we obtain:
   \[
   (a + d)^2 = ab + d
   \]
6. Expanding and  rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = ab + d \implies a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - ab - d = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) and identify the triangles formed by its diagonals. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the vertices and diagonals:**
   A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. When we draw all the diagonals from one vertex, we form a number of triangles. Specifically, from one vertex, we can draw 9 diagonals (since we can't draw a diagonal to itself or to its two adjacent vertices).

2. **Count the triangles:**
   When we draw the diagonals from one vertex, we divide the dodecagon into 10 triangles. This is because we start with one triangle (the triangle formed by the two adjacent sides and the diagonal), and then each additional diagonal adds another triangle. So, from one vertex, we get 1 + 9 = 10 triangles.

3. **Generalize for all vertices:**
   Since the dodecagon is regular, the number of triangles formed by drawing diagonals from any vertex is the same. Therefore, the number of triangles formed by drawing all the diagonals from any one vertex is 10.

 Thus, the number of triangles formed by drawing all the diagonals from a single vertex of a regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{10}\).```
The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).```

"1. 设 $x$ 为   2021  的所有正整数因子的和。
2. 设 $y$ 为   2021  的所有正整数因子的乘积。
3. 设 $z$ 为   2021  的所有正整数因子的平方和。

首先，我们需要确定2021的因子。由于2021是一个合数，我们可以进行质因数分解：
\[ 2021 = 43 \times 47 \]

因此，2021的因子是：
\[ 1, 43, 47, 2021 \]

4. 计算所有正整数因子的和 \( x \)：
\[ x = 1 + 43 + 47 + 2021 = 2112 \]

5. 计算所有正整数因子的乘积 \( y \)：
\[ y = 1 \times 43 \times 47 \times 2021 \]
由于两个因子的乘积等于原数，我们有：
\[ 43 \times 47 =  2021 \]
因此：
\[ y = 1 \times 2021 \times 2021 = 2021^2 \]

6. 计算所有正整数因子的平方和 \( z \)：
\[ z = 1^2 + 43^2 + 47^2 + 2021^2 \]
\[ z = 1 + 1849 + 2209 + 2021^2 \]
\[ z = 1 + 1849 + 2209 + 2021^2 \]
\[ z = 4059 + 2021^2 \]

7. 计算 \( x^2 + y - z \)：
\[ x^2 = 2112^2 \]
\[ y = 2021^2 \]
\[ z = 4059 + 2021^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y - z = 2112^2 + 2021^2 - (4059 + 2021^2)  \]
\[ x^2 + y - z = 2112^2 + 2021^2 - 4059 - 2021^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y - z = 2112^2 - 4059 \]

8. 计算 \( x^2 \)：
\[ 2112^2 = (2000 + 112)^2 \]
\[ 2112^2 = 2000^2 + 2 \times 2000 \times 112 + 112^2 \]
\[ 2112^2 = 4000000 + 448000 + 12544 \]
\[ 2112^2 = 4460544 \]

9. 最后，计算 \( x^2 + y - z \)：

"To solve the problem, we need to place the digits in the given 2x3 grid such that the sum of the digits in the left column is 999 and the sum of the digits in the right column is 99. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the structure of the grid:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   a & b & c \\
   \hline
   d & e & f \\

"首先，我们从给定的对数方程开始：

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

我们可以将这些方程改写为指数形式：

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

接下来，我们将这三个方程相乘：

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

简化左边，我们得到：

 \[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 \cdot y^2 \cdot z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

右边，我们合并指数：

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

为了将指数相加，我们找到一个共同的分母：

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

 所以：

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

因此：

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = \sqrt[12]{2^{13}}
\]

所以，我们有：

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt[12]{2^{13}}
\]

这可以写为：

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

接下来，我们需要找到 $|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|$ 的值。使用对数的性质，我们可以将这个表达式重写为：

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

 设 $\log_2(x) = a$，$\log_2(y) = b$，$\log_2(z) = c$。那么我们有：

\[
\log_2(xyz) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z) = a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

我们需要找到 $4a + 3b + 2c$。我们可以使用以下方程组来表示 $a$，$b$ 和 $c$：

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{2} \implies a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{3} \implies b - a - c  = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) = \frac{1}{4} \implies c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

将这三个方程相加，我们得到：

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

我们已经知道 $a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}$，所以我们可以将这个值代入 $4a + 3b + 2c$ 的表达式中。我们可以通过将方程组相加和相减来得到 $4a + 3b + 2c$ 的值：

"Given that the hexagon has all its internal angles equal to either 120°, 160°, or 200°, and the sum of the internal angles of a hexagon is 720°, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \(x\) be the number of 120° angles, \(y\) be the number of 160° angles, and \(z\) be the number of 200° angles. We know that:

\[x + y + z = 6 \quad \text{(since there are 6 angles in a hexagon)}\]

\[120x + 160y + 200z = 720 \quad \text{(since the sum of the internal angles is 720°)}\]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 40:

\[3x + 4y + 5z = 18\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(x + y + z = 6\)
2. \(3x + 4y + 5z = 18\)

We can eliminate one of the variables  by manipulating these equations. Let's eliminate \(x\) by multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second equation:

\[3x + 4y + 5z - (3x + 3y + 3z) = 18 - 18\]
\[y + 2z = 0\]
\[y = -2z\]

Since \(y\) and \(z\) are non-negative integers, the only solution to \(y = -2z\) is \(y = 0\) and \(z = 0\). Substituting \(y = 0\) and \(z = 0\) into the first equation, we get:

\[x + 0 + 0 = 6\]
\[x = 6\]

So, the hexagon has 6 angles of 120°. Therefore, the three consecutive angles that are equal are all 120°. The three consecutive angles that are equal are:

"Given that \( N \) is the largest 4-digit number with the property that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7, we need to find \( N \) when divided by 1000 gives a quotient \( Q \) and a remainder \( R \), and then find \( Q + R \).

First, let's denote \( N \) as \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \). If we change any one of these digits to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. Let's consider the cases one by one:

1. \( a \) is changed to 1: The number becomes \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \). This number must be divisible by 7.
2. \( b \) is changed to 1: The number becomes \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \). This number must be divisible by 7.
3. \(  c \) is changed to 1: The number becomes \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \). This number must be divisible by 7.
4. \( d \) is changed to 1: The number becomes \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \). This number must be divisible by 7.

We need to find the largest 4-digit number \( N \) that satisfies all these conditions. Let's start by checking the largest possible values for \( a, b, c, d \).

If \( a = 9 \), then changing \( a \) to 1 gives \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \), which must be divisible by 7. This means \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), we have \( 6 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}  \), or \( 100b + 10c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).

If \( b = 9 \), then changing \( b \) to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \), which must be divisible by 7. This means \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). Since \( 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \) and \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we have \( 6a + 2 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), or \( 6a + 10c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \).

If \( c = 9 \), then changing \( c \) to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \), which must be divisible by 7. This means \( 1000a +  100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). Since \( 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \) and \( 100b \equiv 2b \pmod{7} \), we have \( 6a + 2b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), or \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \).

If \( d = 9 \), then changing \( d \) to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \), which must be divisible by 7. This means \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). Since \( 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \), \( 100b \equiv 2b \pmod{7} \), and \( 10c \equiv 3c \pmod{7}  \), we have \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), or \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \).

By solving these congruences, we find that the largest number that satisfies all these conditions is 9991. Now, we need to find the quotient and remainder when 9991 is divided by 1000. We have \( 9991 = 1000 \times 9 + 991 \). So, \( Q = 9 \) and \( R = 991 \). Therefore, \( Q + R = 9 + 991 = 1000 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric relationships and transformations involved. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the original and transformed shapes:**
   - The original shape is a parabola with its vertex at the origin \((0,0)\) and a focus at \((0,6)\).
   - The transformed shape \(S\) is a similar parabola with its vertex at \((11,0)\).

2. **Determine the equations of the parabolas:**
   - The equation of the original parabola is \(y = \frac{1}{12}x^2\).
   - The equation of the transformed parabola \(S\) is \(y = \frac{1}{12}(x-11)^2\).

3. **Find the points of intersection:**
   - Set the equations equal to each other to find the points where the parabolas intersect:
     \[
     \frac{1}{12}x^2 = \frac{1}{12}(x-11)^2
     \]
     Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x^2 = (x-11)^2 
     \]
     Expand and solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x^2 = x^2 - 22x + 121 \implies 0 = -22x + 121 \implies 22x = 121 \implies x = \frac{121}{22} = \frac{11}{2}
     \]
     Substitute \(x = \frac{11}{2}\) back into the equation of the original parabola to find \(y\):
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{12}\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{12} \cdot \frac{121}{4} = \frac{121}{48}
     \]
     So, the points of intersection are \(\left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{121}{48}\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{121}{48}\right)\).

4. **Determine the distances from the centers of the parabolas to the points of intersection: **
   - The distance from the vertex of the original parabola to the point of intersection is the focal length of the parabola, which is 6.
   - The distance from the vertex of the transformed parabola to the point of intersection is also the focal length of the parabola, which is 6.

5. **Calculate the distances \(r_i\) and \(r_o\):**
   - The distance \(r_i\) from the center of the original parabola to the point of intersection is the distance from \((0,0)\) to \(\left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{121}{48}\right)\):
     \[
     r_i = \sqrt{\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{121}{48}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{121}{4} + \frac{14641}{2304}} = \sqrt{\frac{6912}{2304} + \frac{14641}{2304}} = \sqrt{\frac{21553}{2304 }}
     \]
   - The distance \(r_o\) from the center of the transformed parabola to the point of intersection is the distance from \((11,0)\) to \(\left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{121}{48}\right)\):
     \[
     r_o = \sqrt{\left(11 - \frac{11}{2}\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{121}{48}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{121}{48}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{121}{4} + \frac{14641}{2304}} = \sqrt{\frac{21553}{2304}}

6. **Calculate \(r_i - r_o\):**

"To solve this problem, we need to arrange the blocks in a 5x5 grid such that:

1. The block with the largest number is in the top-left corner.
2. Every row and every column contains all the numbers from 1 to 5.
3. The sums of the numbers in each row and each column are the same.

This is a classic problem of constructing a 5x5 magic square where the sum of each row, each column, and both diagonals is the same. The sum for a 5x5 magic square is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5(5^2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5(25 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 26}{2} = 65
\]

So, each row, column, and diagonal must sum to 65. One of the most well-known methods to construct a 5x5 magic square is the S account method. Here is how we can arrange the numbers:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
17 & 24 & 1  & 8 & 15 \\

10 & 12 & 19 & 21 & 3 \\
11 & 18 & 25 & 2 & 9 \\

1. The block with the largest number (25) is in the top-left corner.
2. Each row and each column contains all the numbers from 1 to 5 exactly once.
3. The sum of each row and each column is 65.
