Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total sum of the numbers on the balls in each bag\nEach bag contains the numbers 1 through 9. The sum of the first 9 natural numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n = 9 \\). Therefore,\n\\[\nS = \\frac{9 \\times 10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible sums after one ball is removed\nWhen Billy or Crystal removes one ball, the sum of the remaining balls in their bag is:\n\\[\nb = 45 - k \\quad \\text{or} \\quad c = 45 - k\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number on the ball removed.

From the list above, the pairs are:\n\\[\n(0, 0), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)\n\\]\n\nEach value of \\( b \\) modulo 4 appears 3 times (since there are 9 possible values of \\( k \\) and each value of \\( b \\) modulo 4 is equally likely).

What is the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 ?","response":"To determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the top faces of two fair six-sided dice is divisible by 5, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**\n   Each die has 6 faces, so when two dice are thrown, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the condition for the product to be divisible by 5:**\n   The product of the numbers on the two dice will be divisible by 5 if at least one of the dice shows a 5. This is because 5 is a prime number, and the only way for the product to include 5 as a factor is if one of the numbers is 5.\n\n3. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   We can use the complement rule to find the number of favorable outcomes. First, we count the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5. If neither die shows a 5, each die can show one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes where neither die shows a 5 is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 = 25\n   \\]\n   This means there are 25 outcomes where the product is not divisible by 5. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the product is divisible by 5 is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 25 = 11\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the probability:**\n   The probability that the product of the two numbers is divisible by 5 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11}{36}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}\n\\]","answer":"$\\frac{11}{36}$"}
