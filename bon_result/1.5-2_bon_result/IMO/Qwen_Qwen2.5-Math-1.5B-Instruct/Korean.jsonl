In a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by:\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\nFor a 2006-sided polygon, the sum of the interior angles is:\n\\[\n(2006-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2004 \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\nThis means the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is \\( 2004 \\times 180^\\circ \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine how many isosceles triangles can be formed from these angles. An isosceles triangle can be formed if two of its angles are equal. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\), if two angles are equal, the third angle must be \\( 180^\\circ - 2 \\times \\text{(equal angle)} \\).\n\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we need to consider the distribution of the angles. The key is to note that each angle in the polygon can be part of multiple isosceles triangles. However, the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed from the angles of a polygon is limited by the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nFor a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed is \\( n-2 \\). This is because each vertex of the polygon can be the apex of an isosceles triangle, and there are \\( n \\) vertices, but we need to subtract 2 because the two triangles that share the same base are counted twice.\n\nTherefore, for a 2006-sided polygon, the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed is:\n\\[\n2006 - 2 = 2004\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed from the angles of a 2006-sided polygon is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2004}\n\\]","answer":"1003"}

Each vector from 1 to \\( n \\) must be a consecutive run of integers.\n2. Each vector from \\( n+1 \\) to \\( 2n \\) must also be a consecutive run of integers.\n3. The vectors from 1 to \\( n \\) and from \\( n+1 \\) to \\( 2n \\) must be disjoint.\n4. The total number of integers \\( k \\) is \\( k \\geq n \\geq 1 \\).\n5. The difference \\( k - n \\) is an integer.\n\nGiven these conditions, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these vectors. Let's denote the vectors as follows:\n- Vector A: \\( (1, 2, \\ldots, n) \\)\n- Vector B: \\( (n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2n) \\)\n\nWe need to arrange these vectors such that they form consecutive runs and are disjoint.

However, the problem does not specify the exact values of \\( N \\) and \\( M \\), but rather asks for the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\).\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can infer that the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is independent of the specific values of \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) and depends only on the number of vectors and the positions they can occupy.\n\nThe ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) can be determined by considering the combinatorial nature of the problem. Since the vectors are disjoint and must be consecutive runs, the ratio is essentially the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) vectors in \\( k \\) positions divided by the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) vectors in \\( k \\) positions, which is simply 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]","answer":"2^{k-n}"}

Then the expression becomes:\n\\[\n(1 + 2)(1 + b) = 3(1 + b)\n\\]\nFor \\( 3(1 + b) \\) to be a perfect square, \\( 1 + b \\) must be of the form \\( 3k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). The smallest such \\( b \\) is 2 (since \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)). So, let's try \\( g(2) = 2 \\). Then we have:\n\\[\n3(1 + 2) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 = 3^2\n\\]\nwhich is a perfect square. So, \\( g(2) = 2 \\) works.\n\nNow, let's try to generalize this. Suppose \\( g(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\). Then the expression becomes:\n\\[\n(g(m) + n)(m + g(n)) = (m + n)(m + n) = (m + n)^2\n\\]\nwhich is clearly a perfect square. So, \\( g(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) is a solution.\n\nTo confirm that this is the only solution, we need to show that \\( g(n) = n \\) is the only function that satisfies the given condition. Suppose there is another function \\( g \\) that satisfies the condition. Then for \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[\n(g(1) + 1)(1 + g(1)) = (g(1) + 1)^2\n\\]\nwhich is a perfect square. This is true for any \\( g(1) \\), but we need to check if there are any other possible values for \\( g(1) \\). If \\( g(1) \\neq 1 \\), then \\( g(1) \\) must be such that \\( (g(1) + 1)(1 + g(1)) \\) is a perfect square. However, the only way this can happen is if \\( g(1) = 1 \\) (since any other value would not yield a perfect square). Therefore, \\( g(1) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\). The expression becomes:\n\\[\n(g(2) + 1)(2 + g(1)) = (g(2) + 1)(2 + 1) = 3(g(2) + 1)\n\\]\nThis must be a perfect square. As we saw before, the only way this can happen is if \\( g(2) = 2 \\). Therefore, \\( g(2) = 2 \\).\n\nBy induction, we can show that \\( g(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\). Assume \\( g(k) = k \\) for all \\( k \\leq n \\). Then for \\( m = n \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), the expression becomes:\n\\[\n(g(n) + 1)(n + g(1)) = (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2\n\\]\nwhich is a perfect square. Therefore, \\( g(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nThus, the only function \\( g : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{g(n) = n}\n\\]","answer":"c \\geq 0, g(n) = n + c"}

Let's denote this gcd by \\( d \\), so we have \\( d = \\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) \\).\n\nFirst, we observe that \\( d \\) must divide any linear combination of \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\). Specifically, we can consider the expression \\( a^n + b - a(b^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\cdots + a) \\). Simplifying this, we get:\n\\[\na^n + b - a(b^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\cdots + a) = b.\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( b \\). Similarly, we can consider the expression \\( b^n + a - b(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\cdots + b) \\), which simplifies to:\n\\[\nb^n + a - b(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\cdots + b) = a.\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must also divide \\( a \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) must be a common divisor of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let \\( g = \\gcd(a, b) \\). We need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\ge N \\), \\( g \\) is the gcd of \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\).\n\nTo do this, we need to check the behavior of \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\) modulo \\( g \\). Since \\( g \\) divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we have \\( a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g} \\) and \\( b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g} \\). Therefore, for any \\( n \\), we have:\n\\[\na^n + b \\equiv 0 + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g},\n\\]\n\\[\nb^n + a \\equiv 0 + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g}.\n\\]\nThis means that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\) for all \\( n \\). However, we need to ensure that \\( g \\) is the greatest common divisor for all \\( n \\ge N \\). To do this, we need to check if there is any smaller \\( N \\) that works. If we choose \\( N = 1 \\), then for \\( n = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[\na^1 + b = a + b,\n\\]\n\\[\nb^1 + a = b + a.\n\\]\nThe gcd of \\( a + b \\) and \\( b + a \\) is \\( a + b \\), which is not necessarily \\( g \\). Therefore, \\( N = 1 \\) does not work. We need to check \\( N = 2 \\):\n\\[\na^2 + b,\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 + a.\n\\]\nWe need to check if \\( g \\) is the gcd of these two expressions for \\( n = 2 \\). Since \\( a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g} \\) and \\( b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g} \\), we have:\n\\[\na^2 + b \\equiv 0 + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g},\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 + a \\equiv 0 + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{g}.\n\\]\nThis means that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a^2 + b \\) and \\( b^2 + a \\). Therefore, \\( N = 2 \\) works. For \\( n \\ge 2 \\), the gcd of \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\) will still be \\( g \\).\n\nThus, the smallest \\( N \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}.\n\\]","answer":"(1, 1)"}
