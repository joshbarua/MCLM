Specifically, on move \\( n \\), the goat travels \\( n \\) units in the direction determined by the position of \\( n \\) in the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's break down the movements step by step:\n\n1.

What is the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 ?","response":"To determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the top faces of two fair six-sided dice is divisible by 5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**\n   Each die has 6 faces, so when two dice are thrown, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the condition for the product to be divisible by 5:**\n   The product of the numbers on the two dice will be divisible by 5 if at least one of the numbers is a 5. This is because 5 is a prime number, and the only way for the product to include 5 as a factor is if one of the numbers is 5.\n\n3. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   - If the first die shows a 5, the second die can show any of the numbers 1 through 6. This gives us 6 outcomes: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n   - If the second die shows a 5, the first die can show any of the numbers 1 through 6. This also gives us 6 outcomes: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n   - However, the outcome (5,5) is counted twice in the above lists. To avoid double-counting, we subtract 1 from the total count.\n   Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 6 - 1 = 11\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the probability:**\n   The probability that the product of the two numbers is divisible by 5 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11}{36}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}\\).","answer":"$\\frac{11}{36}$"}

The initial order of contestants is some permutation of \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n\\).\n2. Every minute, the jury chooses an integer \\(i\\) with \\(1 \\leq i \\leq n\\).\n3.

If contestant \\(C_i\\) has fewer than \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, the restaurant opens and the process ends.\n\nThe key insight is to maximize the number of times contestants move forward. This happens when \\(C_i\\) has at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, which means \\(C_i\\) is in one of the first \\(n-i+1\\) positions in the queue.\n\nTo maximize the number of euros collected, we should arrange the contestants in such a way that as many contestants as possible have at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of them for as long as possible. The optimal arrangement is to place the contestants in reverse order, i.e., \\(C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1\\).\n\nLet's analyze this arrangement:\n- Initially, \\(C_n\\) is in the last position and has \\(n-1\\) contestants in front of her. She can move forward every minute until \\(i = n-1\\), which takes \\(1\\) minute, and she moves to the first position.\n- Now, \\(C_{n-1}\\) is in the first position and has \\(0\\) contestants in front of her. She cannot move forward and the process ends.\n\nHowever, this is not the optimal strategy because we can continue moving forward in subsequent rounds. Let's consider a different approach.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to place the contestants in a way that maximizes the number of times contestants can move forward. One such strategy is to place the contestants in a cyclic pattern, where each contestant moves forward one position every minute until the last contestant in the cycle moves to the first position, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nFor example, if \\(n = 4\\), the initial order could be \\(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\). Here's the process:\n- \\(C_1\\) moves forward 1 position.\n- \\(C_2\\) moves forward 2 positions.\n- \\(C_3\\) moves forward 3 positions.\n- \\(C_4\\) moves forward 4 positions and ends up in the first position, so the process ends.\n\nThe total number of euros collected is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\) for \\(n = 4\\).\n\nFor general \\(n\\), the total number of euros collected is the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers, which is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of euros that the jury can collect is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\\).","answer":"$2^{n}-n-1$"}

Here, \\(\\underline{\\mathrm{W}} \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\underline{\\mathrm{E}}\\) and \\(\\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{S}} \\underline{\\mathrm{H}}\\) are four-digit and three-digit numbers respectively, and all digits are distinct.\n\nFirst, let's denote the four-digit number \\(\\underline{\\mathrm{W}} \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\underline{\\mathrm{E}}\\) as \\(1000W + 100A + 10D + E\\) and the three-digit number \\(\\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{S}} \\underline{\\mathrm{H}}\\) as \\(100A + 10S + H\\). The equation then becomes:\n\\[1000W + 100A + 10D + E + 100A + 10S + H = 2030.\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[1000W + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030.\\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[1000W + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030.\\]\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we need to minimize the other terms. Let's start by considering the largest possible value for \\(W\\). Since \\(W\\) is a digit, the largest possible value for \\(W\\) is 2 (because if \\(W = 3\\), then \\(1000W = 3000\\) which is greater than 2030).\n\nIf \\(W = 2\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[2000 + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030.\\]\nSubtracting 2000 from both sides, we get:\n\\[200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30.\\]\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we need to minimize \\(A\\), \\(S\\), and \\(H\\). The smallest possible value for \\(A\\) is 1 (since \\(A\\) is a non-zero digit and all digits must be distinct). If \\(A = 1\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[200 + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30.\\]\nSubtracting 200 from both sides, we get:\n\\[10D + E + 10S + H = -170,\\]\nwhich is not possible since the left side is positive. Therefore, we need to try a smaller value for \\(A\\).\n\nIf \\(A = 0\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[0 + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[10D + E + 10S + H = 30.\\]\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we need to minimize \\(S\\) and \\(H\\). The smallest possible values for \\(S\\) and \\(H\\) are 0 and 3 respectively (since they must be distinct and non-zero). However, \\(S\\) cannot be 0 because \\(A\\) is already 0. Therefore, the smallest possible values for \\(S\\) and \\(H\\) are 1 and 2 respectively. If \\(S = 1\\) and \\(H = 2\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[10D + E + 10 + 2 = 30.\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[10D + E + 12 = 30.\\]\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get:\n\\[10D + E = 18.\\]\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we need to maximize \\(D\\) and \\(E\\). The largest possible value for \\(D\\) is 1 (since \\(D\\) must be a digit and distinct from \\(A\\), \\(S\\), and \\(H\\)). If \\(D = 1\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[10 + E = 18.\\]\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n\\[E = 8.\\]\nTherefore, the values are \\(D = 1\\) and \\(E = 8\\), and the largest possible value of \\(D + E\\) is:\n\\[D + E = 1 + 8 = 9.\\]\nThus, the largest possible value of \\(D + E\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).","answer":"9"}
