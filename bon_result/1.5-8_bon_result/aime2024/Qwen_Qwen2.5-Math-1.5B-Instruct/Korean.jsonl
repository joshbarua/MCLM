We start with \\( n \\) pieces of cake. Each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 pieces of cake. The game continues until the last piece of cake is removed, and the player who removes the last piece wins. We need to determine the smallest possible value of \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024.\n\nFirst, let's identify the losing positions. A losing position is a number of pieces of cake from which the second player can always force a win. If a player is faced with a losing position, any move they make will leave the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, if a player is faced with a winning position, they can always make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.\n\nWe can use the concept of the \"winning\" and \"losing\" positions to solve this problem. A position is losing if and only if the next player to move from that position will always lose if the opponent plays optimally. Let's denote the losing positions by \\( L \\) and the winning positions by \\( W \\).\n\nWe start by identifying the smallest losing position:\n- \\( n = 0 \\) is a losing position because the game is over and the player who is about to move loses.\n\nNext, we determine the positions that lead to \\( n = 0 \\):\n- \\( n = 1 \\) is a winning position because the player can take the last piece and win.\n- \\( n = 2 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 or 2 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (either 1 or 0 pieces respectively).\n- \\( n = 3 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 or 3 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (either 2 or 0 pieces respectively).\n- \\( n = 4 \\) is a winning position because the player can take all 4 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (0 pieces).\n\nWe continue this process to identify more losing positions. A position is losing if and only if every move from that position leads to a winning position. Let's denote the positions and determine the losing positions:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) is a losing position because any move leaves the opponent in a winning position (1, 2, or 4 pieces respectively).\n\nWe can generalize this pattern:\n- \\( n = 6 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (5 pieces).\n- \\( n = 7 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 3 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (4 pieces).\n- \\( n = 8 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 4 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (4 pieces).\n\nWe observe that the losing positions are of the form \\( n = 5k \\) where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer. This is because any move from a position of the form \\( 5k \\) will leave the opponent in a winning position. To confirm, let's check the next few positions:\n- \\( n = 9 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (8 pieces).\n- \\( n = 10 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 2 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (8 pieces).\n- \\( n = 11 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (10 pieces).\n\nGiven that the smallest positive losing position is \\( n = 5 \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024. Since 2024 is not a multiple of 5, it is a winning position for the first player. The smallest losing position greater than or equal to 2024 is \\( 2025 \\), which is \\( 5 \\times 405 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024, is \\(\\boxed{2024}\\).","answer":809}

However, these roots are not 13th roots of unity. Therefore, we need to evaluate the product directly.\n\nThe product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) can be evaluated using properties of roots of unity and symmetric functions. It turns out that the product of all such terms for a primitive 13th root of unity \\(\\omega\\) is given by the constant term of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) evaluated at a specific point.\n\nAfter evaluating the product, we find that the value of the product is \\(13^3 = 2197\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2197}\\).","answer":321}

We also need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right is the same as the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n\nThis is a classic problem of constructing a magic square. A 5x5 magic square is a 5x5 grid filled with the numbers 1 to 25 such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The constant sum for a 5x5 magic square is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n^2+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{5(5^2+1)}{2} = \\frac{5(25+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 26}{2} = 65\n\\]\n\nSo, each row, column, and diagonal must sum to 65. One of the most well-known methods to construct a 5x5 magic square is the \"slope method\" or the \"\u5f22 method.\" However, for simplicity, we can use a known solution for a 5x5 magic square:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n17 & 24 & 1 & 8 & 15 \\\\\n23 & 5 & 7 & 14 & 16 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 13 & 20 & 22 \\\\\n10 & 12 & 19 & 21 & 3 \\\\\n11 & 18 & 25 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nLet's verify that this arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n1. Each row sums to 65:\n   - \\(17 + 24 + 1 + 8 + 15 = 65\\)\n   - \\(23 + 5 + 7 + 14 + 16 = 65\\)\n   - \\(4 + 6 + 13 + 20 + 22 = 65\\)\n   - \\(10 + 12 + 19 + 21 + 3 = 65\\)\n   - \\(11 + 18 + 25 + 2 + 9 = 65\\)\n\n2. Each column sums to 65:\n   - \\(17 + 23 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 65\\)\n   - \\(24 + 5 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 65\\)\n   - \\(1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + 25 = 65\\)\n   - \\(8 + 14 + 20 + 21 + 2 = 65\\)\n   - \\(15 + 16 + 22 + 3 + 9 = 65\\)\n\n3. Both diagonals sum to 65:\n   - \\(17 + 5 + 13 + 21 + 9 = 65\\)\n   - \\(15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11 = 65\\)\n\nSince all the conditions are satisfied, the arrangement of the games in the grid is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n17 & 24 & 1 & 8 & 15 \\\\\n23 & 5 & 7 & 14 & 16 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 13 & 20 & 22 \\\\\n10 & 12 & 19 & 21 & 3 \\\\\n11 & 18 & 25 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]","answer":902}
