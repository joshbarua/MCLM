It shows a right triangle, right? The points are D, E, and F. From the Asymptote code, I can see that F is at (0,0), E is at (0,7), and D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, let me visualize this. Point F is the origin, E is straight up along the y-axis 7 units, and D is somewhere to the right of E, at (sqrt(51),7). So, connecting these points, we have triangle DEF, which is a right triangle because there's a right angle at E.\n\nThe problem says that sin D is 0.7, and we need to find the length of DE. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some trigonometry basics. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse.\n\nLooking at triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. So, the sides relative to angle D are: the opposite side would be EF, and the hypotenuse would be DF. Wait, let me make sure. In triangle DEF, angle D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, the sides adjacent to angle D are DE and DF, but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in triangle DEF, the right angle is at E, so the sides are DE, EF, and DF. So, angle D is one of the non-right angles. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is opposite side EF, and adjacent to side DE. So, the hypotenuse is DF.\n\nSo, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF. They told us that sin D is 0.7, so EF / DF = 0.7.\n\nFrom the coordinates, EF is the vertical side from E to F, which is 7 units long because E is at (0,7) and F is at (0,0). So, EF = 7.\n\nSo, plugging into the equation: 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me calculate that. 7 divided by 0.7 is 10. So, DF is 10 units.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for DE, not DF. So, DE is the other leg of the right triangle. Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. So, DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2.\n\nWe know EF is 7, DF is 10, so DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. That is, DE^2 + 49 = 100. So, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. Therefore, DE = sqrt(51).\n\nWait, but hold on. From the coordinates, D is at (sqrt(51),7), and E is at (0,7). So, the distance between D and E is just the horizontal distance, which is sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). So, that matches with what I just calculated. So, DE is sqrt(51).\n\nBut let me double-check. If sin D is 0.7, which is 7/10, so that makes sense because EF is 7 and DF is 10. So, that ratio is 0.7, which is sin D. Then, using Pythagoras, DE is sqrt(10^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(51). So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used cosine. Since cos D would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is DE / DF. So, cos D = DE / 10. But I don't know cos D, but since sin^2 D + cos^2 D = 1, so cos D = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51). So, DE = 10 * sqrt(0.51). Wait, sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.714, but 10 * 0.714 is about 7.14, which is not sqrt(51). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.714, but 10 * 0.714 is about 7.14, but DE is sqrt(51), which is approximately 7.1414. So, actually, that does make sense. Because sqrt(51) is approximately 7.1414, which is roughly 7.14. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, both methods give me DE = sqrt(51). So, that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The coordinates given are D at (sqrt(51),7), E at (0,7), and F at (0,0). So, DE is the horizontal line from (0,7) to (sqrt(51),7), so the distance is just sqrt(51). So, that's straightforward.\n\nBut the problem gave us sin D = 0.7, so maybe they expect us to use trigonometry instead of just reading off the coordinates. So, let's go through that again.\n\nIn triangle DEF, right-angled at E. So, angle D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, the sides: opposite to D is EF = 7, adjacent is DE, and hypotenuse is DF.\n\nSo, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 7 / 0.7 = 10.\n\nThen, using Pythagoras, DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. So, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. So, DE = sqrt(51). So, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, whether I use the coordinates directly or use trigonometry, I get DE = sqrt(51). So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nI think I've got it. So, DE is sqrt(51).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of DE is \\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of DE.

The rotation is by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians, which is 45 degrees, counterclockwise.\n\nI remember that to rotate a complex number around another complex number, I need to translate the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotating around a point other than the origin requires shifting the coordinate system.\n\nSo, the steps should be:\n\n1. Translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\) to move the center \\( c \\) to the origin.\n2. Multiply the translated complex number by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) to perform the rotation.\n3. Translate back by adding \\( c \\) to the result.\n\nLet me write this out mathematically:\n\n\\( w = c + e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}(z - c) \\)\n\nYes, that seems right. So, let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( z - c \\):\n\n\\( z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \\)\n\nLet me subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal part: \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nImaginary part: \\( -(3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) = -(3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\\sqrt{2})i \\)\n\nSo, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\nHmm, that simplifies nicely.

That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by \\( e^{i\\pi/4} \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). So, when I factor out \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), I get \\( \\sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \\). Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, \\( e^{i\\pi/4} \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), which is \\( \\sqrt{2}/2 (1 + i) \\). So, when I multiply \\( \\sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \\times \\sqrt{2}/2 (1 + i) \\), that's \\( (\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}/2) \\times (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \\).\n\nCompute \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}/2 = (2)/2 = 1 \\). So, that part is correct.\n\nThen, \\( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \\) as before, which is 4 - 2i. So, that seems correct.\n\nThen, adding back \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), so 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCompute \\( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \\):\n\nFirst term: 1*1 = 1\n\nOuter term: 1*i = i\n\nInner term: -3i*1 = -3i\n\nLast term: -3i*i = -3i² = 3\n\nSo, adding up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the multiplication is correct.\n\nTherefore, \\( w = 6 - 5i \\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The Asymptote code in the problem shows that the point Z is at (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)), which is the coordinates of z. The center c is at (2, -3). So, when we subtract c from z, we get (sqrt(2), -3*sqrt(2)), which is the vector from c to z.\n\nThen, rotating this vector by 45 degrees counterclockwise. So, the rotation matrix is [cos45 -sin45; sin45 cos45]. So, multiplying this matrix by the vector (sqrt(2), -3sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx' = sqrt(2)*cos45 - (-3sqrt(2))*sin45\n\ny' = sqrt(2)*sin45 + (-3sqrt(2))*cos45\n\nCompute cos45 and sin45, which are both sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) - (-3sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/2) - (-3*2/2) = 1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\ny' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-3sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/2) + (-3*2/2) = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nSo, the rotated vector is (4, -2). Then, adding back the center c which is (2, -3), we get:\n\nx = 4 + 2 = 6\n\ny = -2 + (-3) = -5\n\nSo, the point w is (6, -5), which corresponds to the complex number 6 - 5i. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe using complex number multiplication directly.\n\nGiven that \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\), which can be written as \\( \\sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \\).\n\nMultiplying by \\( e^{i\\pi/4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, let's compute \\( (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i)(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \\).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\n\nSecond, \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \\times \\frac{2}{2} = i \\)\n\nThird, \\( -3\\sqrt{2}i \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \\times \\frac{2}{2}i = -3i \\)\n\nFourth, \\( -3\\sqrt{2}i \\times i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \\times \\frac{2}{2}i^2 = -3 \\times (-1) = 3 \\)\n\nAdding all these together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i\n\nSo, same result as before. Then, adding c: 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i.\n\nYes, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent \\( z - c \\) in polar form and then add the angle.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\). Let's find its magnitude and angle.\n\nMagnitude: \\( |z - c| = \\sqrt{ (\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\\sqrt{2})^2 } = \\sqrt{2 + 18} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5} \\)\n\nAngle: \\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left( \\frac{-3\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\arctan(-3) \\). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, it's in the fourth quadrant. So, the angle is \\( -\\arctan(3) \\) or \\( 2\\pi - \\arctan(3) \\).\n\nBut when we rotate by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), the new angle will be \\( \\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n\nSo, the new complex number after rotation is \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\left( \\cos(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) + i\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\right) \\)\n\nBut this might be more complicated because I have to compute \\( \\cos(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\) and \\( \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\). Maybe using the angle addition formulas.\n\nAlternatively, since I already have the rectangular form, maybe it's easier to stick with the previous method.\n\nBut just to see, let's compute \\( \\theta = \\arctan(-3) \\). So, \\( \\theta \\) is in the fourth quadrant, approximately -71.565 degrees or 288.435 degrees.\n\nAdding 45 degrees, we get approximately 333.435 degrees, which is equivalent to -26.565 degrees.\n\nSo, the new complex number would have magnitude \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\) and angle approximately -26.565 degrees.\n\nCompute the real part: \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\cos(-26.565^\\circ) \\)\n\nCompute the imaginary part: \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\sin(-26.565^\\circ) \\)\n\nBut \\( \\cos(-26.565^\\circ) = \\cos(26.565^\\circ) \\approx 0.8944 \\)\n\n\\( \\sin(-26.565^\\circ) = -\\sin(26.565^\\circ) \\approx -0.4472 \\)\n\nSo, real part: \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\times 0.8944 \\approx 2 \\times 2.236 \\times 0.8944 \\approx 4.472 \\times 0.8944 \\approx 4 \\)\n\nImaginary part: \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\times (-0.4472) \\approx 4.472 \\times (-0.4472) \\approx -2 \\)\n\nSo, approximately, the rotated vector is \\( 4 - 2i \\), which matches our earlier result. Then, adding back \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), we get \\( 6", "answer": "6 - 5i"}

I remember that simplifying a square root involves breaking it down into factors where at least one is a perfect square. That way, I can take the square root of the perfect square and bring it outside the radical.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the factors of 242. Let me start by checking if 242 is divisible by small prime numbers. I know that 242 is an even number because it ends with a 2, so it's definitely divisible by 2. Let me divide 242 by 2. \n\n242 divided by 2 is 121. Okay, so 242 can be written as 2 multiplied by 121. Now, I need to check if 121 is a perfect square. I recall that 11 times 11 is 121, so yes, 121 is a perfect square. That means I can take the square root of 121 and bring it outside the radical.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the square root of 242 is the square root of (2 times 121). Using the property of square roots that says the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, I can write this as the square root of 2 multiplied by the square root of 121. \n\nSince the square root of 121 is 11, this simplifies to 11 times the square root of 2. Therefore, the simplified form of the square root of 242 is 11√2.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by factoring 242 into 2 and 121, which are correct because 2 times 121 is indeed 242. Then, I recognized that 121 is a perfect square, which it is because 11 squared is 121. So, taking the square root of 121 gives me 11, and the square root of 2 remains under the radical. \n\nI think that's all correct. There are no other perfect square factors of 242 besides 121, so this should be the simplest form. I don't think I missed any steps or made any calculation errors. Yeah, I'm confident that √242 simplifies to 11√2.\n</think>\n\nThe square root of 242 can be simplified by factoring it into 2 and 121.

Yeah, the binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, I can apply this here.\n\nFirst, let me identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in my expression. It looks like \\(a = 10x^3\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\). The exponent \\(n\\) is 5.

First, the binomial coefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{k}\\). Then, \\((10x^3)^{5 - k}\\) is \\(10^{5 - k} x^{3(5 - k)}\\).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if n ≡ 2 mod 7, that means when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So, n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. Maybe substituting this into the expression will help.\n\nLet me write that down: n = 7k + 2. Then, substituting into each term:\n\nn + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4\n\nn + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6\n\nn + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8\n\nWait, 7k + 8 can be simplified modulo 7. Since 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 7k + 8 ≡ 7k + 1 mod 7, which simplifies to 1 mod 7 because 7k is a multiple of 7.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n(n + 2) ≡ 4 mod 7\n\n(n + 4) ≡ 6 mod 7\n\n(n + 6) ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSo, the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7 is equivalent to 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, 4 * 6 is 24. Then, 24 * 1 is still 24. Now, 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, because 7*3=21 and 24-21=3. So, 24 mod 7 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7 is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with n ≡ 2 mod 7, so n = 7k + 2. Then, n + 2 is 7k + 4, which is 4 mod 7. n + 4 is 7k + 6, which is 6 mod 7. n + 6 is 7k + 8, which is 1 mod 7 because 8 - 7 = 1. So, multiplying 4 * 6 * 1 gives 24, and 24 mod 7 is indeed 3. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this without substituting n. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7, n + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7, and n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7. So, the product is 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. 4*6 is 24, which is 3 mod 7, and 3*1 is still 3. So, same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to compute each term modulo 7 first and then multiply. Since multiplication is compatible with modular arithmetic, I can compute each term mod 7 and then multiply the results.\n\nSo, n ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7.\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7.\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 mod 7, which is 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, again, 4 * 6 * 1 = 24, and 24 mod 7 is 3.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods. So, I'm pretty confident the remainder is 3.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can test with a specific number that is 2 mod 7. Let's pick n = 2. Then, (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 192. Now, 192 divided by 7: 7*27=189, so 192 - 189 = 3. So, the remainder is 3. That matches.\n\nLet me try another number, say n = 9, which is also 2 mod 7 (since 9 - 7 = 2). Then, (9 + 2)(9 + 4)(9 + 6) = 11 * 13 * 15. Let's compute that: 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Now, divide 2145 by 7: 7*306=2142, so 2145 - 2142 = 3. Again, the remainder is 3.\n\nOne more test: n = 16, which is 2 mod 7 (16 - 14=2). Then, (16 + 2)(16 + 4)(16 + 6) = 18 * 20 * 22. 18*20=360, 360*22=7920. Now, 7920 divided by 7: 7*1131=7917, so 7920 - 7917=3. Again, remainder 3.\n\nSo, all these examples confirm that the remainder is 3. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, we express \\( n \\) as \\( 7k + 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).

They tell me that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related to the sides. Specifically, for angle A, sin A is the opposite side over the hypotenuse, and cos A is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. So, if I let the sides be labeled as follows: opposite side to angle A is 'a', adjacent side is 'b', and hypotenuse is 'c', then sin A = a/c and cos A = b/c.\n\nThe problem says sin A = 2 cos A. So, substituting the expressions I have, that would be a/c = 2*(b/c). Hmm, okay, so if I write that out, it's a/c = 2b/c. Wait, both sides have a denominator of c, so I can multiply both sides by c to eliminate the denominators. That gives me a = 2b. So, the side opposite angle A is twice the length of the adjacent side.\n\nNow, I need to find tan A. I remember that tan A is sin A over cos A, which is (a/c) / (b/c). The c's cancel out, so tan A is a/b. From earlier, I found that a = 2b, so substituting that in, tan A = (2b)/b. The b's cancel out, so tan A = 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If a = 2b, then tan A = a/b = 2b/b = 2. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I could use the identity that relates tan to sin and cos. Since tan A = sin A / cos A, and we know sin A = 2 cos A, so substituting that in, tan A = (2 cos A) / cos A = 2. Yep, same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me think about the triangle. If angle A has sides a, b, c with a = 2b, then using Pythagoras' theorem, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (2b)^2 + b^2 = 4b^2 + b^2 = 5b^2. So, c = b√5. Then, sin A = a/c = 2b/(b√5) = 2/√5, and cos A = b/c = b/(b√5) = 1/√5. So, sin A is indeed 2 times cos A because 2/√5 is 2*(1/√5). That checks out.\n\nTherefore, tan A is 2.

Let's see, factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Hmm, 2 and 7. If I take -7 and +2, that would give me -7 + 2 = -5, and (-7)*(2) = -14. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x - 7)(x + 2). \n\nSo, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x - 7)(x + 2)]. Therefore, the denominator is zero when x = 7 or x = -2. Now, I should check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is 2x, so when x = 7, numerator is 14, which isn't zero, and when x = -2, numerator is -4, also not zero. So, both x = 7 and x = -2 are vertical asymptotes. So, a and b are 7 and -2. I think the order doesn't matter since we're just adding them later.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.\n\nWait, let me make sure. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote, but maybe an oblique one. But in this case, numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2, so yes, horizontal asymptote is y = 0.\n\nSo, now I have a = 7, b = -2, c = 0. Adding them together: 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. So, the sum is 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my factoring. x² -5x -14. Let me expand (x -7)(x +2) to make sure. x*x = x², x*2 = 2x, -7*x = -7x, -7*2 = -14. So, combining like terms: x² +2x -7x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the horizontal asymptote, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's definitely y=0. So, I think I'm confident with that.\n\nSo, a + b + c is 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. So, the answer should be 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\boxed{5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we factor the denominator:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \\]\n\nThe vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which are \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Thus, \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\n\\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \\]\n\nThe value of \\( a + b + c \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).", "answer": "5"}

Hmm, okay. I remember that this kind of problem relates to the concept of the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, specifically the induced 2-norm, is the smallest such \\( C \\) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \\( \\bold{v} \\). So, I think I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the operator norm? I recall that for a matrix \\( A \\), the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm is equal to the largest singular value of \\( A \\). So, maybe I should compute the singular values of the matrix and take the largest one as \\( C \\).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \\( A^T A \\). That might be a more straightforward method since I can compute \\( A^T A \\) and then find its eigenvalues.\n\nLet me write down the matrix \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, I need to compute \\( A^T \\), the transpose of \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply \\( A^T \\) by \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nLet me perform the matrix multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst row of \\( A^T \\) times first column of \\( A \\):\n\n\\( 2 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 0 = 4 + 0 = 4 \\)\n\nFirst row of \\( A^T \\) times second column of \\( A \\):\n\n\\( 2 \\times 3 + 0 \\times (-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \\)\n\nSecond row of \\( A^T \\) times first column of \\( A \\):\n\n\\( 3 \\times 2 + (-2) \\times 0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \\)\n\nSecond row of \\( A^T \\) times second column of \\( A \\):\n\n\\( 3 \\times 3 + (-2) \\times (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( A^T A \\) is:\n\n\\[\nA^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 13 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues \\( \\lambda \\) satisfy the characteristic equation:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A^T A - \\lambda I) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, let's compute the determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \\lambda & 6 \\\\ 6 & 13 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = (4 - \\lambda)(13 - \\lambda) - (6)(6)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, expand \\( (4 - \\lambda)(13 - \\lambda) \\):\n\n\\( 4 \\times 13 = 52 \\)\n\n\\( 4 \\times (-\\lambda) = -4\\lambda \\)\n\n\\( -\\lambda \\times 13 = -13\\lambda \\)\n\n\\( -\\lambda \\times (-\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (4 - \\lambda)(13 - \\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - 17\\lambda + 52 \\)\n\nThen subtract \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\):\n\nSo, the determinant is \\( \\lambda^2 - 17\\lambda + 52 - 36 = \\lambda^2 - 17\\lambda + 16 \\)\n\nTherefore, the characteristic equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 - 17\\lambda + 16 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{17^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 16}}{2} = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2} = \\frac{17 \\pm 15}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the two eigenvalues are:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{17 + 15}{2} = \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{17 - 15}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of \\( A^T A \\) are 16 and 1. The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm \\( C \\) is the square root of 16, which is 4.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 16 seems a bit high. Let me verify the multiplication of \\( A^T A \\) again.\n\nOriginal matrix \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTranspose \\( A^T \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying \\( A^T A \\):\n\nFirst element: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4\n\nFirst row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nSecond row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nSecond row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nSo, yes, \\( A^T A \\) is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 13 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThen, the determinant calculation:\n\n\\( (4 - \\lambda)(13 - \\lambda) - 36 = \\lambda^2 -17\\lambda + 52 - 36 = \\lambda^2 -17\\lambda +16 \\). That seems correct.\n\nSolving \\( \\lambda^2 -17\\lambda +16 = 0 \\), discriminant is \\( 289 - 64 = 225 \\), so roots are \\( (17 \\pm 15)/2 \\), which gives 16 and 1. So, yes, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest singular value is \\( \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\). So, the operator norm is 4. Therefore, the smallest such \\( C \\) is 4.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is to consider the maximum stretching factor of the matrix. Since the matrix is upper triangular, its eigenvalues are 2 and -2. But operator norm isn't just the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues, right? Because the matrix isn't necessarily symmetric or diagonalizable in a way that the operator norm is just the spectral radius.\n\nWait, actually, for non-normal matrices, the operator norm can be larger than the spectral radius. So, in this case, the matrix isn't symmetric, so its operator norm isn't just the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. So, in this case, the eigenvalues are 2 and -2, but the operator norm is 4, which is larger than 2. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parametrize the vector \\( \\bold{v} \\) as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\), compute \\( A \\bold{v} \\), find its norm, and then find the maximum value of \\( \\frac{\\|A \\bold{v}\\|}{\\|\\bold{v}\\|} \\).\n\nLet me try that approach as a verification.\n\nLet \\( \\bold{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then,\n\n\\[\nA \\bold{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\\\ 0x - 2y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\\\ -2y \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe norm of \\( A \\bold{v} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\n\\]\n\nThe norm of \\( \\bold{v} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, we need to maximize the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\n\\]\n\nLet me square the ratio to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\( t = \\frac{x}{y} \\), assuming \\( y \\neq 0 \\). Then, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nWe can now consider this as a function of \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nf(t) = \\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nTo find its maximum, take the derivative with respect to \\( t \\) and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, compute \\( f'(t) \\):\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\n\\[\nf'(t) = \\frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nFirst term: \\( (8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) = 8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t) = 8t^3 + 24t^2 + 26t \\)\n\nSubtracting the second term from the first:\n\n\\( (8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12) - (8t^3 + 24t^2 + 26t) \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- \\( 8t^3 - 8t^3 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 12t^2 - 24t^2 = -12t^2 \\)\n- \\( 8t - 26t = -18t \\)\n- \\( 12 \\) remains\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\n\\( -12t^2 - 18t + 12 \\)\n\nSet numerator equal to zero:\n\n\\( -12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( 12t^2 + 18t - 12 = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\( 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nSolve for \\( t \\):\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{4} \\)\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\n1. \\( t = \\frac{-3 + 5}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n2. \\( t = \\frac{-3 - 5}{4} = \\frac{-8}{4} = -2 \\)\n\nSo, critical points at \\( t = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( t = -2 \\).\n\nNow, evaluate \\( f(t) \\) at these points.\n\nFirst, \\( t = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + 12 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + 13}{\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + 1} = \\frac{4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 6 + 13}{\\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \\frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 20 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 16\n\\]\n\nWait, that's 16?

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equation \\( z^5 = 1 \\) means that \\( z \\) is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\). These roots can be expressed in the form \\( e^{2\\pi i k/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). Since \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we're looking at the primitive 5th roots of unity, which correspond to \\( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\).\n\nNow, I need to compute \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Let me denote this expression as \\( S \\). So,\n\n\\[\nS = z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2}\n\\]\n\nI notice that \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) is the same as \\( z^4 \\) because \\( z^5 = 1 \\) implies \\( z^{-1} = z^{4} \\). Similarly, \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^{3} \\). So, substituting these into \\( S \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nS = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( S = z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\). Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is,\n\n\\[\n1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, if I subtract 1 from both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\nz + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1\n\\]\n\nWait, that's exactly the sum \\( S \\) that I have! So, does that mean \\( S = -1 \\)?\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify this step by step.\n\nGiven \\( z^5 = 1 \\), so \\( z \\neq 0 \\), and \\( z \\) is a root of the equation \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\). The sum of all roots of this equation is given by the coefficient of \\( z^4 \\), which is 0. So, the sum \\( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about using Euler's formula. Since \\( z = e^{2\\pi i k/5} \\), then \\( z^n = e^{2\\pi i k n /5} \\). So, \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\) would be the sum of four terms on the unit circle in the complex plane. But since they are symmetrically placed, their sum should cancel out except for the real parts. Wait, but I already know from the equation that the sum is -1, so maybe I don't need to go into that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute \\( S \\) by expressing it in terms of cosine since \\( z = e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta = 2\\pi k/5 \\). Then, \\( z + 1/z = 2\\cos\\theta \\) and \\( z^2 + 1/z^2 = 2\\cos(2\\theta) \\). So, \\( S = 2\\cos\\theta + 2\\cos(2\\theta) \\).\n\nLet me compute this. Let \\( \\theta = 2\\pi/5 \\). Then,\n\n\\[\nS = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\nI know that \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right) = -\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right) \\). Similarly, \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) \\) is just \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) \\).\n\nSo, substituting these in,\n\n\\[\nS = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) + 2\\left(-\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right)\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHmm, I wonder if this simplifies to -1. Let me compute the numerical values.\n\nI know that \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right) \\) is approximately 0.8090, and \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) \\) is approximately 0.3090.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.3090 = 0.6180\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.8090 = 1.6180\n\\]\n\\[\n0.6180 - 1.6180 = -1.0\n\\]\n\nSo, that checks out numerically. Therefore, \\( S = -1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that \\( z \\) satisfies \\( z^5 = 1 \\), so \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\). We can factor this as \\( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \\). Since \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we have \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \\), which is exactly \\( S \\).\n\nSo, both methods confirm that \\( S = -1 \\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another value of \\( k \\). Let's take \\( k = 2 \\), so \\( z = e^{4\\pi i /5} \\). Then, \\( z^2 = e^{8\\pi i /5} = e^{(8\\pi i /5 - 2\\pi i)} = e^{-2\\pi i /5} \\), which is the conjugate of \\( z \\). Similarly, \\( z^3 = e^{12\\pi i /5} = e^{(12\\pi i /5 - 2\\pi i)} = e^{2\\pi i /5} \\), and \\( z^4 = e^{16\\pi i /5} = e^{(16\\pi i /5 - 2\\pi i)} = e^{6\\pi i /5} = e^{(6\\pi i /5 - 2\\pi i)} = e^{-4\\pi i /5} \\).\n\nSo, \\( z + z^4 = e^{4\\pi i /5} + e^{-4\\pi i /5} = 2\\cos(4\\pi/5) \\), and \\( z^2 + z^3 = e^{-2\\pi i /5} + e^{2\\pi i /5} = 2\\cos(2\\pi/5) \\). So, adding them together, \\( 2\\cos(4\\pi/5) + 2\\cos(2\\pi/5) \\). But \\( \\cos(4\\pi/5) = -\\cos(\\pi/5) \\), so this becomes \\( -2\\cos(\\pi/5) + 2\\cos(2\\pi/5) \\). As before, this is approximately -1.618 + 0.618 = -1. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which primitive 5th root of unity we take, the sum \\( S \\) is always -1.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-1}\n</think>\n\nGiven the complex number \\( z \\) such that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we need to compute the value of \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that \\( z \\) is a 5th root of unity, excluding 1.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are quadratics, it's a bit more involved. So, I need to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.\n\nLet me write down the multiplication step by step.\n\nThe first polynomial is \\( 3t^2 + 5t + a \\) and the second is \\( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \\). So, I'll distribute each term in the first polynomial across the second polynomial.\n\nStarting with \\( 3t^2 \\):\n- \\( 3t^2 \\times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \\)\n- \\( 3t^2 \\times bt = 3b t^3 \\)\n- \\( 3t^2 \\times (-2) = -6t^2 \\)\n\nNext, the \\( 5t \\) term:\n- \\( 5t \\times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \\)\n- \\( 5t \\times bt = 5b t^2 \\)\n- \\( 5t \\times (-2) = -10t \\)\n\nLastly, the \\( a \\) term:\n- \\( a \\times 4t^2 = 4a t^2 \\)\n- \\( a \\times bt = ab t \\)\n- \\( a \\times (-2) = -2a \\)\n\nNow, let me write all these terms out:\n\n- \\( 12t^4 \\)\n- \\( 3b t^3 + 20t^3 \\)\n- \\( -6t^2 + 5b t^2 + 4a t^2 \\)\n- \\( -10t + ab t \\)\n- \\( -2a \\)\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms.

Got that.\n\n3. For \\( t^2 \\):\n   - Coefficient from our product: \\( -6 + 5b + 4a \\)\n   - Coefficient from given polynomial: -8\n   - So, \\( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \\)\n   - I already know \\( b = 2 \\), so substitute that in:\n     - \\( -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \\)\n     - Calculate \\( 5(2) = 10 \\)\n     - So, \\( -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \\)\n     - Simplify: \\( 4 + 4a = -8 \\)\n     - Subtract 4 from both sides: \\( 4a = -12 \\)\n     - Divide by 4: \\( a = -3 \\)\n   - So, \\( a = -3 \\).

For \\( t \\):\n   - Coefficient from our product: \\( -10 + ab \\)\n   - Coefficient from given polynomial: -16\n   - So, \\( -10 + ab = -16 \\)\n   - Substitute \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):\n     - \\( -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \\)\n     - Calculate \\( (-3)(2) = -6 \\)\n     - So, \\( -10 -6 = -16 \\)\n     - Which is \\( -16 = -16 \\). That checks out.\n\n5. For the constant term:\n   - Coefficient from our product: \\( -2a \\)\n   - Coefficient from given polynomial: 6\n   - So, \\( -2a = 6 \\)\n   - Substitute \\( a = -3 \\):\n     - \\( -2(-3) = 6 \\)\n     - Which is \\( 6 = 6 \\).

It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the maximum value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function needs to be surjective, right?\n\nLet me think about what this function looks like. For x >= a, it's a quadratic function opening upwards if a is positive, or downwards if a is negative. For x < a, it's a linear function with slope a. The function is continuous at x = a because both pieces should meet there. Let me check that.\n\nWhen x = a, the quadratic part gives f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. The linear part gives f(a) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For the function to be continuous at x = a, these two should be equal. So, a³ = a² + 2a. Let me write that equation:\n\na³ - a² - 2a = 0\n\nFactor out an a:\n\na(a² - a - 2) = 0\n\nSo, a = 0 or a² - a - 2 = 0. Solving the quadratic equation:\n\na = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2\n\nSo, a = 2 or a = -1. So, the possible a values for continuity are 0, 2, -1. But since a is a parameter, maybe it's not necessarily required to be continuous? Wait, the problem doesn't specify continuity, just that the graph intersects every horizontal line. Hmm, but if it's not continuous, maybe there's a jump, which could affect the surjectivity.\n\nWait, but if the function isn't continuous, there might be a gap in the graph, meaning some horizontal lines won't intersect. So, maybe for the function to be surjective, it needs to be continuous? Or at least cover all y-values without gaps. So, perhaps a must be such that the function is continuous. So, a can be 0, 2, or -1.\n\nBut let's think about each case.\n\nCase 1: a = 0.\n\nThen f(x) becomes:\n\nf(x) = 0 when x >= 0,\n\nf(x) = 0 + 0 = 0 when x < 0.\n\nSo, f(x) is always 0. That's a constant function. So, the graph is just the x-axis. It only intersects the horizontal line y=0, but not any other horizontal lines. So, a=0 is not good because it doesn't cover all y-values.\n\nCase 2: a = 2.\n\nThen f(x) is:\n\nFor x >= 2: f(x) = 2x²,\n\nFor x < 2: f(x) = 2x + 4.\n\nLet me analyze this function.\n\nFirst, for x >= 2, it's a parabola opening upwards. As x increases, f(x) goes to infinity. As x approaches 2 from the right, f(x) approaches 2*(2)^2 = 8.\n\nFor x < 2, it's a linear function with slope 2. So, as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8. So, it's continuous at x=2.\n\nNow, let's see the behavior of the function.\n\nFor x < 2, f(x) = 2x + 4. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. So, the linear part goes to negative infinity as x decreases.\n\nFor x >= 2, f(x) = 2x², which goes to positive infinity as x increases.\n\nSo, the function spans from negative infinity to positive infinity. But wait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nWait, for x < 2, f(x) = 2x + 4. So, when x is less than 2, the function is linear with a positive slope. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 8.\n\nFor x >= 2, f(x) = 2x², which is a parabola starting at (2,8) and going upwards. So, the function f(x) is continuous at x=2, and it's increasing on both sides.\n\nWait, but is the function surjective? Let's see. For y-values less than 8, the linear part can take any y less than 8 because as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. For y-values greater than or equal to 8, the quadratic part can take any y >=8 because as x increases, f(x) goes to infinity. So, does this function cover all real numbers?\n\nWait, but what about y between negative infinity and 8? The linear part can take any y <8, and the quadratic part can take y >=8. So, yes, every y is covered. So, for a=2, the function is surjective.\n\nCase 3: a = -1.\n\nThen f(x) is:\n\nFor x >= -1: f(x) = (-1)x² = -x²,\n\nFor x < -1: f(x) = (-1)x + 2*(-1) = -x -2.\n\nLet me analyze this function.\n\nFor x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which is a downward opening parabola. The vertex is at x=-1, f(-1) = -(-1)^2 = -1. As x increases beyond -1, f(x) decreases towards negative infinity.\n\nFor x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. This is a linear function with slope -1. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -(-1) -2 = 1 -2 = -1. So, it's continuous at x=-1.\n\nNow, let's see the behavior.\n\nFor x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity because -x becomes large positive. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -1.\n\nFor x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which starts at (-1, -1) and goes downward to negative infinity as x increases.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=-1 has two parts: the linear part goes from positive infinity down to -1 as x goes from negative infinity to -1, and the quadratic part goes from -1 down to negative infinity as x goes from -1 to positive infinity.\n\nSo, the function f(x) covers y from negative infinity up to positive infinity? Wait, no. Because for x < -1, f(x) goes from positive infinity down to -1, and for x >= -1, f(x) goes from -1 down to negative infinity. So, the function f(x) can take any y-value except between -1 and positive infinity? Wait, no.\n\nWait, when x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -1. So, the linear part covers y from -1 to positive infinity.\n\nThe quadratic part, for x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which starts at y=-1 and goes down to negative infinity. So, the quadratic part covers y from -1 to negative infinity.\n\nSo, combining both, the function f(x) for a=-1 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity. So, it is surjective.\n\nWait, but hold on. The linear part covers y >= -1, and the quadratic part covers y <= -1. So, together, they cover all real numbers. So, for a=-1, the function is also surjective.\n\nSo, both a=2 and a=-1 make the function continuous and surjective. But the question is asking for the maximum value of a. So, between 2 and -1, 2 is larger. So, is 2 the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe there are other values of a where the function is surjective without being continuous? Because the problem doesn't specify continuity. So, maybe a can be larger than 2?\n\nWait, let me think. If a is larger than 2, say a=3, what happens?\n\nFor a=3, f(x) is:\n\nFor x >=3: f(x)=3x²,\n\nFor x <3: f(x)=3x +6.\n\nLet me check continuity at x=3.\n\nf(3) from the quadratic side is 3*(3)^2=27.\n\nFrom the linear side, f(3)=3*3 +6=15. So, 27 ≠15, so the function is not continuous at x=3.\n\nSo, there's a jump discontinuity at x=3. The left limit is 15, the right limit is 27.\n\nSo, the function jumps from 15 to 27 at x=3. So, the function f(x) for a=3 is:\n\nFor x <3: linear function 3x +6, which as x approaches 3 from the left, approaches 15.\n\nFor x >=3: quadratic function 3x², which starts at 27 and goes to infinity.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=3 has a jump from 15 to 27. So, the range of f(x) is (-infty,15) union [27, infty). So, there's a gap between 15 and 27. So, any horizontal line between 15 and 27 won't intersect the graph. So, the function is not surjective.\n\nTherefore, a=3 is not acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, if a is greater than 2, the function will have a jump at x=a, and the linear part will approach a*a +2a = a² +2a, while the quadratic part starts at a³. So, for a >2, a³ > a² +2a, because a³ -a² -2a = a(a² -a -2). For a>2, a² -a -2 is positive because a² grows faster. So, a³ > a² +2a, so the jump is upwards, creating a gap between a² +2a and a³. So, the function won't cover y-values in that interval, hence not surjective.\n\nSimilarly, for a < -1, let's say a=-2.\n\nThen f(x) is:\n\nFor x >=-2: f(x)= -2x²,\n\nFor x < -2: f(x)= -2x + (-4) = -2x -4.\n\nCheck continuity at x=-2:\n\nFrom quadratic side: f(-2)= -2*(-2)^2= -8.\n\nFrom linear side: f(-2)= -2*(-2) -4=4 -4=0.\n\nSo, not continuous. The left limit is 0, the right limit is -8. So, there's a jump from 0 to -8 at x=-2.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=-2 is:\n\nFor x < -2: linear function -2x -4. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity.\n\nFor x >= -2: quadratic function -2x², which starts at (-2, -8) and goes downward to negative infinity.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=-2 has a jump from 0 to -8 at x=-2. So, the range is (-infty,0) union (-infty, -8). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the linear part covers y from 0 to positive infinity, and the quadratic part covers y from -8 to negative infinity. So, the function f(x) for a=-2 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity, except between -8 and 0. So, there's a gap between -8 and 0. So, the function is not surjective.\n\nWait, but hold on. The linear part for x < -2 is f(x) = -2x -4. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity. So, the linear part covers y from 0 to positive infinity.\n\nThe quadratic part for x >= -2 is f(x) = -2x², which starts at (-2, -8) and goes down to negative infinity. So, the quadratic part covers y from -8 to negative infinity.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=-2 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity, except between -8 and 0. So, any horizontal line between -8 and 0 won't intersect the graph. Hence, the function is not surjective.\n\nTherefore, for a < -1, the function is not surjective because of the gap between the linear and quadratic parts.\n\nSo, only when a=2 and a=-1, the function is continuous and surjective. But the question is asking for the maximum value of a. So, between 2 and -1, 2 is larger. So, the maximum value of a is 2.\n\nWait, but let me check if a can be greater than 2 but still have the function surjective without being continuous. For example, maybe if the jump is filled in some way? But no, because if a >2, the function jumps from a lower value to a higher value, creating a gap. So, the function can't cover all y-values.\n\nSimilarly, for a between -1 and 2, what happens? Let's say a=1.\n\nThen f(x) is:\n\nFor x >=1: f(x)=1x²,\n\nFor x <1: f(x)=1x +2*1= x +2.\n\nCheck continuity at x=1:\n\nf(1) from quadratic side: 1*(1)^2=1.\n\nFrom linear side: 1 +2=3. So, not continuous. The left limit is 3, the right limit is 1. So, there's a jump downward from 3 to 1 at x=1.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=1 is:\n\nFor x <1: linear function x +2, which as x approaches 1 from the left, approaches 3. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity.\n\nFor x >=1: quadratic function x², which starts at (1,1) and goes to infinity.\n\nSo, the function f(x) for a=1 has a jump from 3 to 1 at x=1. So, the range is (-infty,3) union [1, infty). So, there's a gap between 1 and 3. So, the function is not surjective.\n\nSimilarly, for a between -1 and 2", "answer": "2"}

I need to find the value of \\( c \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the general equation of a circle is usually written in the form \\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the center and \\( r \\) is the radius. So, I think I need to rewrite the given equation into this standard form by completing the square for both the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms.\n\nStarting with the given equation:\n\\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \\]\n\nLet me group the \\( x \\) terms and the \\( y \\) terms together:\n\\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I need to complete the square for the \\( x \\) terms. The coefficient of \\( x \\) is -10. To complete the square, I take half of -10, which is -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I can write:\n\\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \\]\nBecause expanding \\( (x - 5)^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 - 10x + 25 \\), so I have to subtract 25 to keep the equation balanced.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the \\( y \\) terms. The coefficient of \\( y \\) is 6. Half of 6 is 3, and squaring that gives 9. So:\n\\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \\]\nAgain, expanding \\( (y + 3)^2 \\) gives \\( y^2 + 6y + 9 \\), so subtracting 9 keeps the equation balanced.\n\nNow, substituting these back into the original equation:\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \\]\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n-25 - 9 + c = -34 + c\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (-34 + c) = 0 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my steps again. Oh, I see, I should have moved the constant term to the other side. Let me correct that.\n\nStarting from:\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \\]\n\nCombine the constants:\n-25 - 9 = -34, so:\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \\]\n\nTo get the standard form, I need to move the constant term to the other side:\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \\]\n\nNow, this is the standard form of the circle's equation, where the right side is \\( r^2 \\). The problem states that the radius is 1, so \\( r = 1 \\), which means \\( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, I can set up the equation:\n\\[ 34 - c = 1 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\\[ 34 - c = 1 \\]\nSubtract 34 from both sides:\n\\[ -c = 1 - 34 \\]\n\\[ -c = -33 \\]\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\\[ c = 33 \\]\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. When I completed the square for \\( x \\), I had \\( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \\), and for \\( y \\), \\( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \\). Adding those gives \\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \\). Moving \\( c - 34 \\) to the other side gives \\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \\). Since the radius squared is 1, \\( 34 - c = 1 \\), so \\( c = 33 \\). That seems correct.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought I had a negative sign, but no, it looks like the steps are correct. So, the value of \\( c \\) should be 33.\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \\). To find \\( c \\), we rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square.\n\n1. Group and complete the square:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\n   \\]\n2. Combine constants:\n   \\[\n   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0\n   \\]\n3. Move constants to the other side:\n   \\[\n   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\n   \\]\n4. Since the radius is 1, \\( r^2 = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   34 - c = 1 \\implies c = 33\n   \\]\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) is \\boxed{33}.", "answer": "33"}

The function given is f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The function f(x) = λx(1 - x) maps the interval [0,1] to itself when λ is between 0 and 4. So, that's good because the problem states that f maps [0,1] to [0,1], which aligns with λ being in [0,4].\n\nNow, the problem is asking for λ values where there exists an x such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, essentially, x is a periodic point of period 2 for the function f. That means x is not a fixed point, but applying f twice brings us back to x. So, x is part of a 2-cycle.\n\nTo find such λ, I need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x, but exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. So, first, let's write down the equation f(f(x)) = x.\n\nGiven f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's compute that:\n\nf(f(x)) = f(λx(1 - x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nSo, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nWe need this to equal x. So, set up the equation:\n\nλ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nλ² x (1 - x) (1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.\n\nNow, let's try to simplify this equation. First, notice that x is on both sides, so we can factor that out. Let's subtract x from both sides to bring everything to one side:\n\nλ² x (1 - x) (1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.\n\nSo, this gives us two possibilities: either x = 0 or the term in the brackets is zero.\n\nBut x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1 unless λ is such that 0 = 1, which isn't possible. So, x=1 is not a fixed point unless λ is undefined, which it isn't. So, x=1 is not a fixed point.\n\nBut in any case, the problem is looking for x where f(x) ≠ x, so x=0 is a fixed point, so we can ignore that solution. Similarly, x=1 is not a fixed point, but let's check f(1) = 0, so f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0, which is not equal to 1, so x=1 is not a solution to f(f(x))=x either. So, the solutions we are interested in are the ones where the term in the brackets is zero.\n\nSo, let's set the term in the brackets equal to zero:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.\n\nLet me expand this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nLet me denote y = x(1 - x). Then, (1 - x)(1 - λy) = (1 - x) - λy(1 - x).\n\nBut maybe expanding directly is better.\n\nCompute (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1*(1) = 1\n\n1*(-λx) = -λx\n\n1*(λx²) = λx²\n\n(-x)*(1) = -x\n\n(-x)*(-λx) = λx²\n\n(-x)*(λx²) = -λx³\n\nSo, adding all these terms together:\n\n1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant term: 1\n\nLinear terms: -λx - x = -(λ + 1)x\n\nQuadratic terms: λx² + λx² = 2λx²\n\nCubic term: -λx³\n\nSo, altogether:\n\n1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.\n\nTherefore, (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.\n\nNow, multiply this by λ²:\n\nλ² [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] = λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³.\n\nSubtract 1 from this:\n\nλ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nLet me write it in standard polynomial form:\n\n-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x. We are looking for real solutions x in [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x, so x is not a fixed point. The fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, which is λx(1 - x) = x. Let's solve that equation to find the fixed points.\n\nSo, λx(1 - x) = x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nλx(1 - x) - x = 0.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [λ(1 - x) - 1] = 0.\n\nSo, x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0.\n\nSolving λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0:\n\nλ(1 - x) = 1\n\n1 - x = 1/λ\n\nx = 1 - 1/λ.\n\nSo, the fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ, provided that 1 - 1/λ is in [0,1]. Since λ is between 0 and 4, 1/λ is between 0.25 and infinity when λ is between 0 and 4. Wait, actually, when λ is between 0 and 4, 1/λ is between 0.25 (when λ=4) and infinity (as λ approaches 0). But since x must be in [0,1], 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. So, 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 implies that 1/λ ≤ 1, so λ ≥ 1. Similarly, 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 is always true because 1/λ ≥ 0. So, the fixed point x=1 - 1/λ exists only when λ ≥ 1.\n\nSo, for λ < 1, the only fixed point is x=0. For λ ≥ 1, we have two fixed points: x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ.\n\nBut in our problem, we are looking for x such that f(x) ≠ x, so x is not a fixed point. Therefore, for λ < 1, x=0 is the only fixed point, so any solution x ≠ 0 would satisfy f(x) ≠ x. For λ ≥ 1, x=1 - 1/λ is another fixed point, so we need to exclude x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ.\n\nBut let's get back to the cubic equation:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nWe can factor this equation. Let me see if x=1 is a root. Plugging x=1:\n\nλ³(1) - 2λ³(1) + λ²(λ + 1)(1) - (λ² - 1) =\n\nλ³ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² + 1 =\n\n(λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³) + (λ² - λ²) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0.\n\nSo, x=1 is not a root. How about x=0? Plugging x=0:\n\n0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1). So, this is zero only if λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1 or λ=-1. But λ is between 0 and 4, so only λ=1. So, when λ=1, x=0 is a root. But for other λ, x=0 is not a root.\n\nWait, but earlier, we saw that x=0 is a fixed point, so in the equation f(f(x))=x, x=0 is a solution because f(f(0))=f(0)=0. So, x=0 is always a solution, but it's a fixed point, so we need to exclude it. So, in the cubic equation, x=0 is a root only when λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1. So, for λ=1, x=0 is a root, but for other λ, x=0 is not a root of the cubic equation. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The cubic equation is:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nWhen x=0, the equation becomes 0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1). So, this equals zero only when λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1 or λ=-1. Since λ is between 0 and 4, only λ=1. So, for λ=1, x=0 is a root of the cubic equation, but for other λ, x=0 is not a root. However, x=0 is always a fixed point, so f(f(0))=0, which is equal to x=0, so x=0 is always a solution to f(f(x))=x, but it's a fixed point, so we need to exclude it.\n\nTherefore, for λ ≠1, the cubic equation does not have x=0 as a root, so all roots of the cubic equation are non-zero, and thus, for λ ≠1, the solutions to f(f(x))=x are either fixed points or period-2 points. But since we are looking for x where f(x) ≠x, we need to find solutions to the cubic equation that are not fixed points.\n\nBut for λ=1, x=0 is a root of the cubic equation, but it's a fixed point, so we need to see if there are other roots.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to factor the cubic equation. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLooking at the cubic equation:\n\nλ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nLet me factor out λ² from the first three terms:\n\nλ² [λx³ - 2λx² + (λ + 1)x] - (λ² - 1) = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping.\n\nLet me group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(λ³x³ - 2λ³x²) + (λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)) = 0.\n\nFactor out λ³x² from the first group:\n\nλ³x²(x - 2) + [λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)] = 0.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe try to factor the cubic as (ax + b)(cx² + dx + e).

The fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both of which are combinations of sine and cosine terms with different angles. Hmm, okay, let me write this down to visualize it better.\n\nThe expression is:\n\ntan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]\n\nWow, that's a mouthful. I need to simplify both the numerator and the denominator. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to make this easier. Let me recall some identities that might help here.\n\nFirst, I remember that cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. Wait, but in the numerator, I have cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50. Hmm, that seems like two separate terms: (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) and (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50). \n\nWait, actually, if I group them like that, each pair is of the form cosA cosB - sinA sinB, which is exactly the formula for cos(A + B). Because cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So, that means:\n\ncos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20 = cos(5 + 20) = cos25°\nSimilarly, cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50 = cos(35 + 50) = cos85°\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°. Okay, that's a good start.\n\nNow, let's look at the denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50. Hmm, this seems a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can group terms here as well.\n\nLooking at the first two terms: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20. That looks like the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So, sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 = sin(5 + 20) = sin25°.\n\nSimilarly, the next two terms: -sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50. Let me factor out the negative sign: -(sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50). Again, that's the sine addition formula: sin(35 + 50) = sin85°. So, this becomes -sin85°.\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.\n\nSo now, our expression for tan θ is:\n\ntan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]\n\nAlright, so now I have tan θ expressed in terms of cos25, cos85, sin25, and sin85. Maybe I can simplify this further using sum-to-product identities.\n\nI remember that cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2] and sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. Let me apply these identities.\n\nFirst, for the numerator: cos25 + cos85.\n\nUsing the identity, cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). But cosine is even, so cos(-30°) = cos30°. So, numerator becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.\n\nSimilarly, for the denominator: sin25 - sin85.\n\nUsing the identity, sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Sine is odd, so sin(-30°) = -sin30°. Therefore, denominator becomes 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.\n\nSo now, our expression is:\n\ntan θ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]\n\nI can cancel out the 2 and cos55° from numerator and denominator, assuming cos55° ≠ 0, which it isn't because 55° is not 90° or 270°, so that's fine.\n\nSo, tan θ = [cos30°] / [-sin30°] = - [cos30° / sin30°]\n\nI know that cos30° is √3/2 and sin30° is 1/2, so cos30° / sin30° = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3. Therefore, tan θ = -√3.\n\nHmm, so tan θ = -√3. Now, I need to find the smallest positive angle θ where the tangent is -√3. Tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it should be in the fourth quadrant, but wait, actually, the smallest positive angle with tan θ = -√3 is 120°, because tan(120°) = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. Alternatively, in the fourth quadrant, it would be 300°, but 120° is smaller.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The tangent function has a period of 180°, so the general solution is θ = 120° + k*180°, where k is an integer. The smallest positive angle would be 120°, right? Because 120° is less than 180°, and adding 180° would give 300°, which is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. If tan θ = -√3, then θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, the smallest positive angle is 120°, since 120° is less than 300°.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because when I simplified the denominator, I had sin25 - sin85, which became -2 cos55 sin30. So, the denominator was negative, and the numerator was positive, so the overall fraction was negative, leading to tan θ = -√3. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nBut since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, 120° is the answer. But wait, let me think again. Is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is in the second quadrant, but if I consider the principal value of arctangent, which is between -90° and 90°, but since tangent is periodic every 180°, the smallest positive angle would be 120°, as 120° is the first positive angle where tangent is -√3.\n\nWait, but hold on, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is 60° more than 90°, but in terms of the unit circle, 120° is indeed the first angle after 0° where tangent is -√3. Alternatively, if we think of it as a negative angle, it would be -60°, but since we need a positive angle, 120° is the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe I can compute the numerator and denominator numerically to see if tan θ is indeed -√3.\n\nLet me compute the numerator: cos25 + cos85.\n\ncos25 ≈ 0.9063, cos85 ≈ 0.0872. So, 0.9063 + 0.0872 ≈ 0.9935.\n\nDenominator: sin25 - sin85.\n\nsin25 ≈ 0.4226, sin85 ≈ 0.9962. So, 0.4226 - 0.9962 ≈ -0.5736.\n\nSo, tan θ ≈ 0.9935 / (-0.5736) ≈ -1.732, which is approximately -√3 (since √3 ≈ 1.732). So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, as that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because sometimes, depending on the quadrant, the angle might be different. But in this case, since the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, the overall fraction is negative, so tan θ is negative. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. The smallest positive angle is 120°, as 120° is less than 300°, which is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the reference angle, which is 60°, then in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the numerator and denominator. Let me go back through the steps.\n\nNumerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.\n\nI grouped them as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos(5+20) + cos(35+50) = cos25 + cos85. That seems correct.\n\nDenominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50.\n\nI grouped them as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin(5+20) - sin(35+50) = sin25 - sin85. That also seems correct.\n\nThen, using sum-to-product identities:\n\nNumerator: cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55 cos30.\n\nDenominator: sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos55 (-sin30).\n\nSo, tan θ = [2 cos55 cos30] / [-2 cos55 sin30] = - [cos30 / sin30] = -√3. That seems correct.\n\nSo, tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, as that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a smaller positive angle? For example, if I consider θ = 120°, but is there a θ between 0° and 180° that is smaller than 120° where tan θ = -√3? No, because tan θ is negative in the second and fourth quadrants, and the smallest positive angle in the second quadrant where tan θ = -√3 is 120°, as 60° is the reference angle.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of θ as 180° - 60° = 120°, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think 120° is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using the original expression, compute the numerator and denominator numerically and then compute tan θ.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\ncos5 ≈ 0.9962, cos20 ≈ 0.9397, so cos5 cos20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.9365.\n\ncos35 ≈ 0.8192, cos50 ≈ 0.6428, so cos35 cos50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.5265.\n\nsin5 ≈ 0.0872, sin20 ≈ 0.3420, so sin5 sin20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0298.\n\nsin35 ≈ 0.5736, sin50 ≈ 0.7660, so sin35 sin50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.4395.\n\nSo, numerator = 0.9365 + 0.5265 - 0.0298 - 0.4395 ≈ (0.9365 + 0.5265) - (0.0298 + 0.4395) ≈ 1.463 - 0.4693 ≈ 0.9937.\n\nDenominator:\n\nsin5 cos20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0819.\n\nsin35 cos50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.3695.\n\ncos5 sin20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.3405.\n\ncos35 sin50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.6284.\n\n", "answer": "120^\\circ"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with functions of two variables, one way to find maxima or minima is by using calculus, specifically finding the partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. That should give me the critical points, which could be potential maxima or minima. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify or analyze the function a bit.\n\nLooking at the function, it's symmetric in x and y. That is, if I swap x and y, the function remains the same. So, maybe the maximum occurs when x equals y? That might be a good starting point. Let me test that idea.\n\nIf x = y, then the function becomes f(x, x) = x√(1 - x²) + x√(1 - x²) = 2x√(1 - x²). So, now I have a single-variable function: g(x) = 2x√(1 - x²). I can find the maximum of this function by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of g(x). Using the product rule, g'(x) = 2√(1 - x²) + 2x*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x). Wait, let me double-check that. The derivative of √(1 - x²) is (1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = -x/√(1 - x²). So, applying the product rule:\n\ng'(x) = 2√(1 - x²) + 2x*(-x/√(1 - x²)) = 2√(1 - x²) - (2x²)/√(1 - x²).\n\nTo combine these terms, I can write them with a common denominator:\n\ng'(x) = [2(1 - x²) - 2x²]/√(1 - x²) = [2 - 2x² - 2x²]/√(1 - x²) = [2 - 4x²]/√(1 - x²).\n\nSetting this equal to zero for critical points:\n\n2 - 4x² = 0 => 4x² = 2 => x² = 1/2 => x = ±√(1/2) = ±(√2)/2.\n\nSince we're looking for the maximum, and considering the domain of x is between -1 and 1, let's plug x = √2/2 into g(x):\n\ng(√2/2) = 2*(√2/2)*√(1 - (1/2)) = √2 * √(1/2) = √2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for x = -√2/2, g(-√2/2) = 2*(-√2/2)*√(1 - 1/2) = -√2*(√2/2) = -1. So, the maximum when x = y is 1.\n\nBut wait, is this the global maximum for the original function f(x, y)? Maybe I should check other possibilities where x ≠ y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric substitution could help. Since the terms √(1 - y²) and √(1 - x²) remind me of sine and cosine functions. Let me try substituting x = sinθ and y = sinφ, where θ and φ are angles between -π/2 and π/2. Then, √(1 - x²) = cosθ and √(1 - y²) = cosφ.\n\nSo, substituting, f(x, y) becomes sinθ * cosφ + sinφ * cosθ = sin(θ + φ). Because sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So, f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ).\n\nNow, the maximum value of sin(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. But since θ and φ are between -π/2 and π/2, the maximum occurs when θ + φ = π/2.\n\nSo, if θ + φ = π/2, then φ = π/2 - θ. Therefore, y = sinφ = sin(π/2 - θ) = cosθ. But x = sinθ, so y = cosθ = √(1 - x²). So, in this case, y = √(1 - x²). Similarly, x = √(1 - y²). So, this is consistent with the earlier substitution.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1, achieved when x = sinθ and y = cosθ for some θ, which implies that x² + y² = 1. So, the maximum occurs on the unit circle within the domain -1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1.\n\nWait, but earlier when I set x = y, I also got a maximum of 1. So, does that mean that the maximum is indeed 1, and it's achieved both when x = y = √2/2 and when x and y are such that x² + y² = 1?\n\nWait, let me check. If x = √2/2, then y = √2/2, and x² + y² = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. So, actually, the point (x, y) = (√2/2, √2/2) lies on the unit circle. So, both approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should also check the boundaries of the domain. Since x and y are between -1 and 1, the boundaries occur when x or y is -1 or 1.\n\nLet me check the corners: (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1).\n\nAt (1,1): f(1,1) = 1*0 + 1*0 = 0.\n\nAt (1,-1): f(1,-1) = 1*0 + (-1)*0 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, at (-1,1) and (-1,-1), f is also 0. So, the function is 0 at all four corners.\n\nWhat about the edges? For example, when x = 1, f(1, y) = 1*√(1 - y²) + y*0 = √(1 - y²). The maximum of this is 1, achieved when y = 0. Similarly, when y = 1, f(x,1) = x*0 + 1*√(1 - x²) = √(1 - x²), which also has a maximum of 1 at x = 0.\n\nSimilarly, when x = -1, f(-1, y) = (-1)*√(1 - y²) + y*0 = -√(1 - y²), which has a maximum of 0 at y = ±1. Similarly, when y = -1, f(x, -1) = x*0 + (-1)*√(1 - x²) = -√(1 - x²), which also has a maximum of 0 at x = ±1.\n\nSo, on the edges, the maximum value is 1, achieved at (1,0) and (0,1). But wait, earlier we found that the function can reach 1 at (√2/2, √2/2) as well. So, actually, the maximum is 1, and it's achieved at multiple points: (1,0), (0,1), and (√2/2, √2/2), as well as their symmetric counterparts in other quadrants, but since the function is symmetric, the maximum is still 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I substituted x = sinθ and y = sinφ, I assumed that x and y are between -1 and 1, which they are. But does that substitution cover all possible cases? Or are there other critical points where x ≠ y and x² + y² ≠ 1?\n\nTo make sure, let's go back to the original function and compute the partial derivatives.\n\nCompute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.\n\nFirst, ∂f/∂x:\n\nf(x,y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²)\n\nSo, ∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) + y*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²).\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y = √(1 - x²) + x*(1/(2√(1 - y²)))*(-2y) = √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²).\n\nTo find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²) = 0\n\n2. √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²) = 0\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)  ...(1)\n\nAnd equation 2 as:\n\n√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)  ...(2)\n\nNow, let's square both sides of equation (1):\n\n(1 - y²) = (x² y²)/(1 - x²)\n\nSimilarly, square equation (2):\n\n(1 - x²) = (x² y²)/(1 - y²)\n\nSo, from equation (1):\n\n(1 - y²)(1 - x²) = x² y²\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\n(1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x² y²\n\nSo, both equations lead to the same equation: (1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x² y².\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n1 - x² - y² + x² y² = x² y²\n\nSubtract x² y² from both sides:\n\n1 - x² - y² = 0 => x² + y² = 1.\n\nSo, the critical points lie on the unit circle. Therefore, the maximum must occur on the unit circle, which aligns with our earlier substitution.\n\nSo, substituting x² + y² = 1 into equation (1):\n\n√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)\n\nBut since x² + y² = 1, √(1 - y²) = |x| and √(1 - x²) = |y|. Assuming x and y are positive (since we're looking for maximum, which likely occurs in the first quadrant), we can drop the absolute values:\n\nx = (xy)/y => x = x. Hmm, that's trivial. Wait, let me substitute √(1 - y²) = x and √(1 - x²) = y.\n\nSo, equation (1):\n\nx = (xy)/y => x = x, which is always true.\n\nSimilarly, equation (2):\n\ny = (xy)/x => y = y, which is also always true.\n\nSo, the only condition is x² + y² = 1.\n\nTherefore, all points on the unit circle are critical points. But we need to find which of these gives the maximum value.\n\nEarlier, we saw that f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ) when x = sinθ and y = sinφ, but actually, with substitution x = sinθ and y = sinφ, we had f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). But wait, that might not be accurate because if x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then √(1 - x²) = cosθ and √(1 - y²) = cosφ, so f(x, y) = sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ = sin(θ + φ). So, the maximum of sin(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = π/2.\n\nBut since x² + y² = 1, and x = sinθ, y = sinφ, we have sin²θ + sin²φ = 1. Hmm, that's a bit more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parameterize x and y on the unit circle. Let me set x = cosα and y = sinα, where α is an angle. Then, x² + y² = cos²α + sin²α = 1, which satisfies the condition.\n\nThen, f(x, y) = cosα * √(1 - sin²α) + sinα * √(1 - cos²α) = cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα = cos²α + sin²α = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, if I parameterize x and y on the unit circle as x = cosα, y = sinα, then f(x, y) = 1 for all α. That suggests that the function f(x, y) is constant and equal to 1 on the unit circle. But that contradicts our earlier result where f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ), which can vary between -1 and 1.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.\n\nIf I set x = cosα, y = sinα, then √(1 - y²) = √(1 - sin²α) = cosα, and √(1 - x²) = √(1 - cos²α) = sinα. So, f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²) = cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα = cos²α + sin²α = 1. So, yes, f(x, y) = 1 for all points on the unit circle.\n\nBut earlier, when I set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, I got f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the substitution was different.\n\nWait, in the first substitution, I set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, which led to f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). But in the second substitution, I set x = cosα and y = sinα, leading to f(x, y) = 1. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the first substitution was incorrect because if x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then", "answer": "1"}

The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Specifically, vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that to find the area of a triangle in 3D space, one common method is to use the cross product of two sides. Let me think about how that works.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found by half the magnitude of their cross product. So, if I can find vectors OA and OB, then compute their cross product, and then find the magnitude of that cross product, I can get the area by taking half of that.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, the triangle is OAB, so the two sides from point O are OA and OB. So, yes, the vectors OA and OB are the two sides meeting at point O. Therefore, the area should be half the magnitude of the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nLet me write down the vectors:\n\nOA = (1, 2, 3)\nOB = (-3, -2, 1)\n\nSo, I need to compute OA × OB. The cross product formula for two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nLet me compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst component: a2b3 - a3b2\na2 is 2, b3 is 1, so 2*1 = 2\na3 is 3, b2 is -2, so 3*(-2) = -6\nSo, first component is 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSecond component: a3b1 - a1b3\na3 is 3, b1 is -3, so 3*(-3) = -9\na1 is 1, b3 is 1, so 1*1 = 1\nSo, second component is -9 - 1 = -10\n\nThird component: a1b2 - a2b1\na1 is 1, b2 is -2, so 1*(-2) = -2\na2 is 2, b1 is -3, so 2*(-3) = -6\nSo, third component is -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4\n\nSo, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Now, I need to find the magnitude of this vector.\n\nThe magnitude of a vector (x, y, z) is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, let's compute each component squared:\n\n8² = 64\n(-10)² = 100\n4² = 16\n\nAdding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180\n\nSo, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let me see, 180 = 36 * 5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude is 6√5.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle OAB is half of this, which is (6√5)/2 = 3√5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my cross product calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That seems right.\n\nSecond component: a3b1 - a1b3 = 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 -1 = -10. Correct.\n\nThird component: a1b2 - a2b1 = 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 +6 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo, cross product is indeed (8, -10, 4). The magnitude squared is 64 + 100 + 16 = 180, so magnitude is sqrt(180) = 6√5. Then, half of that is 3√5. So, the area is 3√5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about using the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates. But since these are vectors from the origin, the cross product method is straightforward.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute the lengths of OA and OB, and the angle between them, then use the formula (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta). But that would require computing the angle, which is more steps. The cross product method is more direct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute |OA| and |OB|.\n\n|OA| = sqrt(1² + 2² + 3²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 9) = sqrt(14)\n|OB| = sqrt((-3)² + (-2)² + 1²) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(14)\n\nSo, both vectors have the same magnitude, sqrt(14). Then, the cross product magnitude is |OA||OB|sin(theta) = sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)*sin(theta) = 14 sin(theta). But we found that the cross product magnitude is 6√5, so 14 sin(theta) = 6√5, so sin(theta) = (6√5)/14 = (3√5)/7.\n\nThen, the area is (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta) = (1/2)*14*(3√5)/7 = (1/2)*2*3√5 = 3√5. So, same result. That confirms it.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the area is 3√5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of triangle \\( OAB \\) is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of triangle \\( OAB \\) with points \\( O \\), \\( A \\), and \\( B \\) given by the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{OA} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we use the cross product method.\n\nFirst, compute the cross product \\( \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n-3 & -2 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{i}(2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-2)) - \\mathbf{j}(1 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-3)) + \\mathbf{k}(1 \\cdot (-2) - 2 \\cdot (-3))\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component:\n- First component: \\( 2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n- Second component: \\( -(1 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \\)\n- Third component: \\( 1 \\cdot (-2) - 2 \\cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \\)\n\nThus, the cross product is:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, find the magnitude of this cross product:\n\\[\n\\left| \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} \\right| = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \\sqrt{180} = 6\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nThe area of triangle \\( OAB \\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle \\( OAB \\) is \\(\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}\\).", "answer": "3 \\sqrt{5}"}

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expressions like \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} \\) often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since \\( z \\) is a complex number, it might be helpful to express it in polar form. \n\nFirst, let me denote \\( w = z + \\frac{1}{z} \\). So, in this case, \\( w = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\). I recall that \\( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) is actually the golden ratio, often denoted by \\( \\phi \\). Interesting, so \\( w = \\phi \\).\n\nNow, if I can express \\( z \\) in terms of \\( w \\), maybe I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation for \\( z^n + \\frac{1}{z^n} \\). Let me try to find a relationship between \\( z^n \\) and \\( z^{n-1} \\) or something like that.\n\nI remember that for such expressions, there's a recursive formula. Specifically, if I let \\( a_n = z^n + \\frac{1}{z^n} \\), then \\( a_n \\) satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[\na_n = w \\cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nIs that right? Let me verify. If I multiply both sides of \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} = w \\) by \\( z^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \\), I get:\n\n\\[\n(z + \\frac{1}{z})(z^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{z^{n-1}}) = w \\cdot a_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nz^n + \\frac{1}{z^{n-2}} + \\frac{1}{z^n} + z^{n-2} = w \\cdot a_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach. Let me consider \\( a_n = z^n + \\frac{1}{z^n} \\). Then, multiplying \\( a_1 = w \\) by \\( a_{n-1} \\):\n\n\\[\na_1 \\cdot a_{n-1} = \\left(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\left(z^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{z^{n-1}}\\right) = z^n + \\frac{1}{z^n} + z^{n-2} + \\frac{1}{z^{n-2}} = a_n + a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[\na_n = w \\cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( a_0 = z^0 + \\frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \\), and \\( a_1 = w = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, I can use this recurrence relation to compute \\( a_n \\) for any \\( n \\). But computing up to \\( n = 85 \\) manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or periodicity in the sequence \\( a_n \\)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for \\( a_n \\). Since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous, I can solve it using characteristic equations.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the recurrence \\( a_n - w a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nr^2 - w r + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet me compute the roots of this quadratic equation. The discriminant is:\n\n\\[\nD = w^2 - 4\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( w = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\), let's compute \\( w^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nw^2 = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\nD = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's negative, so the roots will be complex.

Maybe instead of going this route, I can express \\( z \\) in exponential form. Let me assume \\( z = e^{i\\theta} \\), so that \\( \\frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\\theta} \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nz + \\frac{1}{z} = 2\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me compute \\( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4} \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236 \\), so \\( 1 + \\sqrt{5} \\approx 3.236 \\), divided by 4 is approximately 0.809. So, \\( \\cos\\theta \\approx 0.809 \\). That corresponds to an angle \\( \\theta \\) where cosine is about 0.809. Let me see, \\( \\cos(36^\\circ) \\) is approximately 0.8090, which is \\( \\pi/5 \\) radians. So, \\( \\theta = \\pi/5 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( z = e^{i\\pi/5} \\) or \\( z = e^{-i\\pi/5} \\). So, \\( z \\) is a primitive 10th root of unity? Wait, because \\( e^{i\\pi/5} \\) has order 10, since \\( (e^{i\\pi/5})^{10} = e^{i2\\pi} = 1 \\). So, \\( z \\) is a 10th root of unity.\n\nTherefore, \\( z^{10} = 1 \\). So, \\( z^{10} = 1 \\), which implies that \\( z^{n} = z^{n \\mod 10} \\). So, the powers of \\( z \\) cycle every 10. Therefore, \\( z^{85} = z^{85 \\mod 10} = z^5 \\). Similarly, \\( \\frac{1}{z^{85}} = \\frac{1}{z^5} = z^{-5} \\).\n\nSo, \\( z^{85} + \\frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^5 + z^{-5} \\). So, I need to compute \\( z^5 + \\frac{1}{z^5} \\).\n\nBut since \\( z = e^{i\\pi/5} \\), \\( z^5 = e^{i\\pi} = -1 \\). Therefore, \\( z^5 + \\frac{1}{z^5} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If \\( z = e^{i\\pi/5} \\), then \\( z^5 = e^{i\\pi} = -1 \\). Similarly, \\( \\frac{1}{z^5} = e^{-i\\pi} = -1 \\). So, yes, \\( z^5 + \\frac{1}{z^5} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if \\( z = e^{-i\\pi/5} \\), then \\( z^5 = e^{-i\\pi} = -1 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{z^5} = e^{i\\pi} = -1 \\). So, same result.\n\nTherefore, \\( z^{85} + \\frac{1}{z^{85}} = -2 \\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, since \\( z^{10} = 1 \\), then \\( z^{85} = z^{85 \\mod 10} = z^5 \\). So, yes, that's correct because 85 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 5. So, \\( z^{85} = z^5 \\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute \\( z^5 \\) using the original equation. Maybe I can find a pattern or use the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven that \\( a_n = z^n + \\frac{1}{z^n} \\), and we have the recurrence \\( a_n = w a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \\), with \\( a_0 = 2 \\) and \\( a_1 = w \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( a_2 \\):\n\n\\[\na_2 = w a_1 - a_0 = w^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nWe already computed \\( w^2 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[\na_2 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nOkay, \\( a_2 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nNow, \\( a_3 = w a_2 - a_1 \\):\n\n\\[\na_3 = w \\cdot \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} - w\n\\]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute \\( w \\cdot \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{(1)(-1) + (1)(\\sqrt{5}) + (\\sqrt{5})(-1) + (\\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{5})}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \\frac{-1 + 0 + 5}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( a_3 = 1 - w \\).

A line through G parallel to BC cuts AB at M and AC at N. So, MN is parallel to BC and passes through G.\n\nSince MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. That theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.\n\nSo, the ratio of similarity between triangle AMN and triangle ABC is something I need to find. Since MN passes through the centroid G, which divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, maybe this ratio is related to that.\n\nWait, let me think. If MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, then the distance from A to MN is less than the distance from A to BC. Since G is the centroid, it's located 2/3 of the way along each median from the vertex. So, the height from A to MN would be 2/3 of the height from A to BC.\n\nBut wait, if MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, then the ratio of similarity should be the ratio of the distances from A. Since G is 2/3 along the median, the height from A to MN is 2/3 of the height from A to BC. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 2/3.\n\nBut hold on, if the ratio is 2/3, then the area ratio would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9. So, the area of triangle AMN would be 4/9 of the area of ABC, which is 144. So, 144 * 4/9 = 64. So, area of AMN is 64.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the area of triangle ENG, not AMN. Hmm, so I need to figure out where points E and N are. Wait, E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. So, E is the midpoint of AC, and N is the intersection point of the line MN with AC.\n\nSo, triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G. Let me try to find the coordinates or use coordinate geometry to find the area.\n\nMaybe assigning coordinates to the triangle would help. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me set point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates so that the midpoints will have integer coordinates, making calculations easier.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n- A: (0, 0)\n- B: (2b, 0)\n- C: (2c, 2d)\n\nThen, the midpoints:\n- D is the midpoint of BC: ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)\n- E is the midpoint of AC: ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)\n- F is the midpoint of AB: ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)\n\nThe centroid G is the intersection of the medians. The centroid's coordinates are the average of the vertices' coordinates:\nG_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3\nG_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3\n\nSo, G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).\n\nNow, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. Let me find the equation of BC first. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b).\n\nSince MN is parallel to BC, it has the same slope, d/(c - b). The line MN passes through G, so its equation is:\n\n(y - (2d)/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nNow, I need to find where this line intersects AB and AC. Let's find point M on AB and point N on AC.\n\nFirst, let's find point M on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0). So, AB lies along the x-axis, y = 0.\n\nSet y = 0 in the equation of MN:\n\n0 - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nMultiply both sides by (c - b)/d:\n\n-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3\n\nBring the term on the right to the left:\n\nx = (2b + 2c)/3 - 2(c - b)/3\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2b + 2c - 2c + 2b = 4b\n\nSo, x = 4b/3\n\nTherefore, point M is at (4b/3, 0)\n\nSimilarly, find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). Let me parametrize AC. The parametric equations can be written as x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, substitute x and y into the equation of MN:\n\ny - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nSubstitute x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t:\n\n2d*t - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2d*t - 2d/3 = 2d(t - 1/3)\n\nRight side:\n\n(d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2b/3 - 2c/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2c/3 - 2b/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)\n\nWait, maybe factor differently:\n\n= (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3) = (d/(c - b))( (6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3 ) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3\n\nSo, left side: 2d(t - 1/3) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3\n\nDivide both sides by d:\n\n2(t - 1/3) = (1/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3(c - b):\n\n6(c - b)(t - 1/3) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c\n\nExpand left side:\n\n6(c - b)t - 2(c - b) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c\n\nSimplify:\n\n6c*t - 6b*t - 2c + 2b = 6c*t - 2b - 2c\n\nSubtract 6c*t from both sides:\n\n-6b*t - 2c + 2b = -2b - 2c\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-6b*t - 2c + 2b + 2b + 2c = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-6b*t + 4b = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n-6b*t + 4b = 0 => b(-6t + 4) = 0\n\nAssuming b ≠ 0 (since AB has length 2b, which can't be zero), then:\n\n-6t + 4 = 0 => t = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nSo, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nSo, coordinates of N: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nNow, we have points E, N, and G.\n\nPoint E is the midpoint of AC, which is (c, d)\n\nPoint N is (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nPoint G is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)\n\nSo, triangle ENG has vertices at E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and G((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)\n\nTo find the area of triangle ENG, I can use the shoelace formula.\n\nFirst, let's list the coordinates:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)\n\nLet me write them in order:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)\n\nBack to E: (c, d)\n\nCompute the shoelace sum:\n\nSum1 = c*(4d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*d\n\nSum2 = d*(4c/3) + (4d/3)*((2b + 2c)/3) + (2d/3)*c\n\nArea = |Sum1 - Sum2| / 2\n\nCompute Sum1:\n\nFirst term: c*(4d/3) = (4cd)/3\n\nSecond term: (4c/3)*(2d/3) = (8cd)/9\n\nThird term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*d = (2b + 2c)d / 3 = (2bd + 2cd)/3\n\nSo, Sum1 = (4cd)/3 + (8cd)/9 + (2bd + 2cd)/3\n\nConvert all to ninths:\n\n(12cd)/9 + (8cd)/9 + (6bd + 6cd)/9 = (12cd + 8cd + 6bd + 6cd)/9 = (26cd + 6bd)/9\n\nSum1 = (6bd + 26cd)/9\n\nCompute Sum2:\n\nFirst term: d*(4c/3) = (4cd)/3\n\nSecond term: (4d/3)*((2b + 2c)/3) = (4d/3)*(2b + 2c)/3 = (8bd + 8cd)/9\n\nThird term: (2d/3)*c = (2cd)/3\n\nSo, Sum2 = (4cd)/3 + (8bd + 8cd)/9 + (2cd)/3\n\nConvert all to ninths:\n\n(12cd)/9 + (8bd + 8cd)/9 + (6cd)/9 = (12cd + 8bd + 8cd + 6cd)/9 = (26cd + 8bd)/9\n\nSum2 = (8bd + 26cd)/9\n\nNow, compute Sum1 - Sum2:\n\n(6bd + 26cd)/9 - (8bd + 26cd)/9 = (6bd - 8bd + 26cd - 26cd)/9 = (-2bd)/9\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2:\n\nArea = | -2bd / 9 | / 2 = (2bd / 9) / 2 = bd / 9\n\nSo, the area of triangle ENG is bd / 9.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.\n\nWhat's the area of triangle ABC? Using coordinates, it's |(Ax(By - Cy) + Bx(Cy - Ay) + Cx(Ay - By))/2|\n\nPlugging in A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d):\n\nArea ABC = |0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0)| / 2 = |0 + 4bd + 0| / 2 = |4bd| / 2 = 2|bd|\n\nGiven that area ABC is 144, so 2|bd| = 144 => |bd| = 72\n\nTherefore, bd = ±72, but since area is positive, we can say bd = 72.\n\nSo, the area of triangle ENG is bd / 9 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nTherefore, the area is 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the shoelace formula: I think I did it correctly, but let me verify.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nE: (c, d)\n\nN: (4c/3, 4d/3)\n\nG: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)\n\nCompute Sum1:\n\nE.x * N.y = c * (4d/3) = 4cd/3\n\nN.x * G.y = (4c/3) * (2d/3) = 8cd/9\n\nG.x * E.y = ((2b + 2c)/3) * d = (2bd + 2cd)/3\n\nSum1 = 4cd/3 + 8cd/9 + (2bd + 2cd)/3\n\nConvert to ninths:\n\n12cd/9 + 8cd/9 + 6bd/9 + 6cd/9 = (12cd + ", "answer": "8"}

{"original_question": "$\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}$을 유한 소수로 변환하세요.", "question": "$\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}$을 유한 소수로 변환하세요.", "response": "Okay, so I have this fraction, 21 over (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power), and I need to convert it into a finite decimal. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a fraction will be a finite decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is already 2² multiplied by 5⁷, so that should work out.\n\nFirst, let me write down the fraction: 21/(2² * 5⁷). I need to convert this into a decimal. I think the way to do this is to make the denominator a power of 10 because decimals are based on tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., which are powers of 10. Since 10 is 2 times 5, and the denominator is already a product of powers of 2 and 5, I can adjust the numerator and denominator to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nSo, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷. Let me calculate what that is. 2 squared is 4, and 5 to the seventh power is... let me compute that step by step. 5^1 is 5, 5^2 is 25, 5^3 is 125, 5^4 is 625, 5^5 is 3125, 5^6 is 15625, and 5^7 is 78125. So, 2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125. Multiplying those together, 4 * 78125. Let me do that multiplication: 78125 * 4. 78125 * 2 is 156250, so times 4 is 312500. So the denominator is 312500.\n\nSo, the fraction is 21/312500. Now, to convert this into a decimal, I can perform the division 21 divided by 312500. Alternatively, since the denominator is a power of 10, I can adjust the numerator to make the denominator 10^n. Let me see, 312500 is 10^5 multiplied by 3.125, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can think of 312500 as 10^5 * 3.125, but maybe a better approach is to adjust the numerator and denominator so that the denominator becomes a power of 10.\n\nWait, another way is to note that 2² * 5⁷ can be written as 5⁵ * (2² * 5²) because 5⁷ is 5⁵ * 5², and 2² * 5² is 10², which is 100. So, 2² * 5⁷ = 5⁵ * 100. Therefore, the denominator is 5⁵ * 100. Hmm, but 5⁵ is 3125, so 3125 * 100 is 312500, which matches what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes 10^7, since 5⁷ is part of the denominator. Let me see: 2² is 4, so 2² * 5⁷ is 4 * 5⁷. To make the denominator 10^7, I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by 2^5, because 10^7 is 2^7 * 5^7. So, currently, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷, so to get to 2^7 * 5^7, I need to multiply by 2^(7-2) = 2^5. So, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5.\n\n2^5 is 32. So, multiplying numerator 21 by 32 gives 21 * 32. Let me compute that: 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 672. The denominator becomes 2^7 * 5^7, which is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. So now the fraction is 672/10,000,000.\n\nTo convert this into a decimal, I can write it as 0.0000672 because 672 divided by 10,000,000 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. Let me verify that: 672 divided by 10 is 67.2, divided by 10 again is 6.72, again is 0.672, again is 0.0672, again is 0.00672, again is 0.000672, and again is 0.0000672. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have done the division 21 divided by 312500 directly. Let me try that to confirm. 21 divided by 312500. Since 312500 goes into 21 zero times, I add a decimal point and some zeros. 312500 goes into 210000 zero times. 312500 goes into 2100000 how many times? Let me see: 312500 * 6 is 1,875,000, which is less than 2,100,000. 312500 * 7 is 2,187,500, which is more than 2,100,000. So it goes 6 times. 6 * 312500 is 1,875,000. Subtract that from 2,100,000, we get 225,000. Bring down the next zero, making it 2,250,000. 312500 goes into that 7 times because 312500 * 7 is 2,187,500. Subtracting gives 62,500. Bring down a zero, making it 625,000. 312500 goes into that exactly 2 times. So putting it all together, we have 0.0000672.\n\nWait, let me recount the decimal places. When I did 21 divided by 312500, I added a decimal and then started with 210000, which is 210000.0. So the first division step after the decimal is 210000 divided by 312500, which is 0. So we have 0., then 0.0, then 0.00, then 0.000, then 0.0000, then 0.00006, and so on. Wait, maybe I miscounted the decimal places. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the denominator is 10^7 after multiplying numerator and denominator by 32, the decimal should have 7 places. So 672 divided by 10^7 is 0.0000672, which is 6.72 x 10^-5. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to express the original fraction as 21/(2² * 5⁷). To make the denominator a power of 10, we need to have equal numbers of 2s and 5s. Since there are more 5s (7) than 2s (2), we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5=32 to balance it out. So, 21*32=672, and denominator becomes 10^7=10,000,000. So, 672/10,000,000=0.0000672.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the finite decimal representation of 21/(2² * 5⁷) is 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) can be converted into a finite decimal by adjusting the denominator to a power of 10. \n\nFirst, note that the denominator \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) can be balanced by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\) to make the denominator \\(10^7\\). This gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\times 32}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\times 2^5} = \\frac{672}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a decimal involves placing the numerator 672 over 10,000,000, which results in moving the decimal point seven places to the left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{672}{10,000,000} = 0.0000672\n\\]\n\nThus, the finite decimal representation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]", "answer": ".0000672"}

{"original_question": "분수 $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$의 유한 소수 표현에서 각 자리 숫자의 합은 얼마입니까?", "question": "분수 $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$의 유한 소수 표현에서 각 자리 숫자의 합은 얼마입니까?", "response": "Okay, so I have this fraction, 4321 over 5 to the 7th power times 2 to the 8th power. I need to find the sum of the digits in its finite decimal representation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a fraction will have a finite decimal representation if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is already 5^7 * 2^8, so that's good—it should convert to a finite decimal.\n\nNow, to convert the fraction into a decimal, I need to make sure the denominator is a power of 10 because 10 is 2*5. So, the idea is to adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes 10 raised to some power. \n\nLooking at the denominator, 5^7 * 2^8, I notice that 5^7 and 2^7 would make 10^7, but there's an extra 2^1 left. So, I can rewrite the denominator as 10^7 * 2^1, which is 10^7 * 2. That means the denominator is 2 * 10^7.\n\nSo, the fraction becomes 4321 divided by (2 * 10^7). I can separate this into two parts: 4321 divided by 2, and then divided by 10^7. Let me compute 4321 divided by 2 first.\n\n4321 divided by 2 is 2160.5. Wait, that's a decimal. Hmm, maybe I should handle it differently. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5 to make the denominator a power of 10. Let me try that.\n\nThe denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 5, the denominator becomes 5^8 * 2^8, which is (5*2)^8 = 10^8. So, the new fraction is (4321 * 5) / 10^8.\n\nCalculating 4321 * 5: 4000*5 is 20,000, 300*5 is 1,500, 20*5 is 100, and 1*5 is 5. Adding those together: 20,000 + 1,500 is 21,500; 21,500 + 100 is 21,600; 21,600 + 5 is 21,605. So, the numerator becomes 21,605.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 21,605 / 10^8. To write this as a decimal, I move the decimal point eight places to the left. Starting from 21,605, which is 21605.0, moving the decimal eight places left would give me 0.21605000. Wait, let me count: 21605.0 becomes 0.21605000 when moving the decimal eight places. So, the decimal representation is 0.21605000.\n\nBut wait, 21,605 divided by 10^8 is 0.21605, but since 10^8 is 100,000,000, it's 0.21605000. So, the decimal is 0.21605000.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of each digit in this decimal. Let's write it out: 0.21605000. The digits after the decimal are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0.\n\nSo, adding them up: 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n2 + 1 is 3. 3 + 6 is 9. 9 + 0 is 9. 9 + 5 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14.\n\nWait, but hold on, the decimal is 0.21605000, so the digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0. So, adding those: 2 + 1 is 3, plus 6 is 9, plus 0 is 9, plus 5 is 14, plus 0 is 14, plus 0 is 14, plus 0 is 14. So, the sum is 14.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in adding.\n\n2 + 1 = 3\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n9 + 0 = 9\n\n9 + 5 = 14\n\n14 + 0 = 14\n\n14 + 0 = 14\n\n14 + 0 = 14\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the sum of the digits is 14.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any digits. The decimal is 0.21605000, so counting each digit after the decimal:\n\n1st digit: 2\n\n2nd: 1\n\n3rd: 6\n\n4th: 0\n\n5th: 5\n\n6th: 0\n\n7th: 0\n\n8th: 0\n\nYes, that's eight digits. So, adding all eight digits: 2+1+6+0+5+0+0+0=14.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits is 14.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the initial fraction conversion again.\n\nOriginal fraction: 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8)\n\nWe multiplied numerator and denominator by 5 to get 4321*5=21605 and denominator becomes 5^8 * 2^8=10^8.\n\nSo, 21605 / 10^8 = 0.21605000.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the decimal is 0.21605000, and the digits after the decimal are 2,1,6,0,5,0,0,0.\n\nSum is 2+1+6+0+5+0+0+0=14.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the digits is \\boxed{14}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \\(\\frac{4321}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8}\\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.\n\nFirst, we note that the denominator \\(5^7 \\cdot 2^8\\) can be rewritten as \\(10^7 \\cdot 2\\). To convert the fraction into a decimal, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5, which gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4321 \\times 5}{5^7 \\cdot 2^8 \\times 5} = \\frac{21605}{10^8}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the decimal \\(0.21605000\\).\n\nNext, we sum the digits of this decimal. The digits after the decimal point are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0. Adding these together:\n\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the digits is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).", "answer": "14"}

Hmm, that's a lot of sine terms multiplied together. I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using certain trigonometric identities or product formulas. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the angles are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, increasing by 20° each time. So, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, and 160°. That's eight terms in total. Maybe there's a pattern or a symmetry here that I can exploit.\n\nI recall that sin(180° - x) = sinx. So, let's see which of these angles are supplementary. For example, sin160° is equal to sin20°, because 160° = 180° - 20°. Similarly, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, and sin100° = sin80°. So, that means:\n\nsin160° = sin20°\nsin140° = sin40°\nsin120° = sin60°\nsin100° = sin80°\n\nSo, substituting these into the original product, we can rewrite the product as:\n\nsin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin80° sin60° sin40° sin20°\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the product becomes [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Because each of the first four terms is repeated again in the second half. So, the original product is the square of the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, and sin80°.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Maybe I can compute the product inside the square first and then square it.\n\nI remember that there's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Let me recall. I think it's something like the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is equal to n/(2^{n-1}). But wait, that's for angles in radians and specific cases. Maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for multiple angles, sometimes using complex numbers or roots of unity can help, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using product-to-sum identities? But that might get messy with four terms.\n\nWait, another thought: I remember that sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. Maybe that identity can help here. Let me check.\n\nLet me test this identity with A = 20°. Then, sin20° sin40° sin80°. Let's compute sin20° sin40° sin80°.\n\nUsing the identity: sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.\n\nSo, if A = 20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4.\n\nWait, sin3A would be sin60°, which is √3/2. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8.\n\nWait, that's a useful result. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = √3/8.\n\nBut in our product, we have sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. So, that's [sin20° sin40° sin80°] * sin60°. We already know that sin20° sin40° sin80° is √3/8, so multiplying by sin60°, which is √3/2, gives:\n\n(√3/8) * (√3/2) = (3/16).\n\nSo, sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = 3/16.\n\nTherefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, let's verify the identity: sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.\n\nLet me compute sin20° sin40° sin80°.\n\nCompute sin20° sin40° sin80°:\n\nUsing the identity, A = 20°, so sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4 = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by sin60°, which is √3/2, gives (√3/8)*(√3/2) = (3/16). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product inside the square is 3/16, so the original product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°, which we rewrote as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. But is that accurate?\n\nWait, let's list the angles again:\n\nsin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, sin160°.\n\nWe know that sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°. So, substituting, the product becomes:\n\nsin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin80° sin60° sin40° sin20°.\n\nWhich is indeed [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.\n\nWait, but let me compute this numerically to check.\n\nCompute sin20° ≈ 0.3420\n\nsin40° ≈ 0.6428\n\nsin60° ≈ 0.8660\n\nsin80° ≈ 0.9848\n\nsin100° ≈ 0.9848\n\nsin120° ≈ 0.8660\n\nsin140° ≈ 0.6428\n\nsin160° ≈ 0.3420\n\nMultiply all together:\n\n0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198\n\n0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903\n\n0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1879\n\n0.1879 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1855\n\n0.1855 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1607\n\n0.1607 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033\n\n0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353\n\nNow, 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625, which is very close to 0.0353. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the value is 9/256.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the identity for multiple angles or product formulas.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the product of sines of equally spaced angles can be expressed using certain formulas. For example, the product sin(π/n) sin(2π/n)...sin((n-1)π/n) = n/(2^{n-1}).\n\nBut in this case, the angles are in degrees, and not necessarily in the form of π/n. Let me see.\n\nWait, 20° is π/9 radians, 40° is 2π/9, 60° is π/3, 80° is 4π/9, 100° is 5π/9, 120° is 2π/3, 140° is 7π/9, 160° is 8π/9.\n\nSo, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) sin(2π/3) sin(7π/9) sin(8π/9).\n\nBut since sin(π - x) = sinx, we can pair them as:\n\nsin(π/9) sin(8π/9) = [sin(π/9)]^2\n\nsin(2π/9) sin(7π/9) = [sin(2π/9)]^2\n\nsin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) = [sin(4π/9)]^2\n\nAnd then we have sin(π/3) and sin(2π/3), which are both √3/2.\n\nSo, the product becomes [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (√3/2)^2.\n\nWait, that's similar to what I did earlier. So, [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (3/4).\n\nBut I know that sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall. There's a formula that sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, I think that's a known identity. So, if that's the case, then [3√3/8]^2 * (3/4) = (27/64) * (3/4) = 81/256.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 9/256. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (3/4).\n\nIf sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8, then squaring that gives (27/64), and multiplying by (3/4) gives 81/256.\n\nBut earlier, I got 9/256. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me check.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that the product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2, which I computed as (3/16)^2 = 9/256.\n\nBut in the second approach, using radians, I get 81/256.\n\nBut numerically, when I computed the product, I got approximately 0.0353, which is close to 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625, but 81/256 ≈ 0.3164, which is much larger. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, so perhaps the second approach is incorrect. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the second approach, I considered the product as [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (√3/2)^2.\n\nBut actually, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) sin(2π/3) sin(7π/9) sin(8π/9).\n\nBut sin(5π/9) = sin(4π/9), sin(7π/9) = sin(2π/9), sin(8π/9) = sin(π/9). So, the product is [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * [sin(π/3) sin(2π/3)].\n\nBut sin(π/3) = sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so their product is (√3/2)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSo, the product is [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * 3/4.\n\nIf sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8, then the product is (27/64) * 3/4 = 81/256.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the product was [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256.\n\nBut numerically, the product is approximately 0.0353, which is close to 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625.\n\nSo, which one is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me compute [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)].\n\nCompute sin(π/", "answer": "\\frac{9}{256}"}

The options are straight line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \\( (r, \\theta, z) \\). In this system, \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \\( \\theta \\) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \\( z \\) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point is defined by these three components.\n\nThe equation given is \\( z = c \\). That means, for any point in space, the z-coordinate is fixed at the constant value \\( c \\). I need to visualize what this looks like. If I fix the z-coordinate, what does that represent geometrically?\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, if I have \\( z = c \\), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \\( c \\). But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, does this change anything? I don't think so because the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. So, regardless of \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\), as long as \\( z \\) is fixed, the shape should still be a plane.\n\nLet me double-check. In cylindrical coordinates, \\( r \\) can vary from 0 to infinity, \\( \\theta \\) can go from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\), and \\( z \\) is fixed. So, for every possible \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\), the point is somewhere on the plane \\( z = c \\). That makes sense because it's not restricting \\( r \\) or \\( \\theta \\), just fixing \\( z \\).\n\nWait, could it be a cylinder? No, because a cylinder in cylindrical coordinates would have a fixed \\( r \\), like \\( r = c \\). Similarly, a cone would have \\( z \\) proportional to \\( r \\), like \\( z = kr \\) for some constant \\( k \\). A sphere would involve all three coordinates, probably something like \\( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \\). A circle would be in a plane with fixed \\( z \\) and fixed \\( r \\), but here \\( r \\) isn't fixed. A straight line would require more constraints, like both \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) being fixed or something.\n\nSo, yeah, since \\( z \\) is fixed and \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) can vary freely, it's a plane. Therefore, the answer should be (C) 평면.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane because it fixes the height \\( z \\) while allowing \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) to vary freely.\n\n\\boxed{C}", "answer": "\\text{(C)}"}

The given information is the magnitudes of a and b, which are 2 and 7 respectively, and their cross product, which is the vector (3, 2, 6). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can set up an equation to solve for sinθ, and then find θ.\n\nLet me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector. The cross product is (3, 2, 6), so its magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so that becomes 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Simplifying the right side: 2*7 is 14, so 7 = 14 sinθ. Dividing both sides by 14 gives sinθ = 7/14, which simplifies to sinθ = 1/2.\n\nAlright, so sinθ is 1/2. Now, I need to find the angle θ where sine is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) is 1/2, and sin(150°) is also 1/2. But since we're looking for the smallest possible angle between the vectors, it should be the acute angle, which is 30 degrees.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross product magnitude is 7, and the product of the magnitudes is 2*7=14. So 7/14 is indeed 1/2. So sinθ is 1/2, which corresponds to 30° and 150°. Since we want the smallest angle, 30° is the answer.\n\nBut hold on, is there any possibility that the angle could be smaller? I don't think so because the sine function reaches 1/2 at 30°, and beyond that, it starts decreasing again. So 30° is the smallest angle where sinθ is 1/2. Therefore, the smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is 30 degrees.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap: cross product magnitude gives me sinθ, which is 1/2, leading to θ being 30°, which is the smallest possible angle. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is \\boxed{30} degrees.\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 2\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = 7\\), and their cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, \\(\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin \\theta\\), we substitute the known values:\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\times 7 \\times \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n7 = 14 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) whose sine is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is either \\(30^\\circ\\) or \\(150^\\circ\\).

I need to find the sum of the roots of g(x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any polynomial, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of the roots would be 49/1, which is 49. But wait, that's for f(x). I need the sum of the roots for g(x), which is f(x + 5). How does shifting the function affect the roots?\n\nLet me recall that if you have a function g(x) = f(x + h), then the graph of g is the graph of f shifted h units to the left. So, if f(x) has roots at x = r1, r2, r3, then g(x) will have roots at x = r1 - h, r2 - h, r3 - h. That makes sense because if you plug x = r1 - h into g(x), you get f((r1 - h) + h) = f(r1) = 0.\n\nSo, if the roots of f(x) are r1, r2, r3, then the roots of g(x) are r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15.\n\nFrom earlier, I know that the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49. So, substituting that in, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be 49 - 15 = 34. Is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find g(x) explicitly and then use Vieta's formula on it. Let's try that approach to confirm.\n\nGiven that g(x) = f(x + 5), so I need to substitute x + 5 into f(x). Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n1. (x + 5)³: I know that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, (x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.\n\n2. -49(x + 5)²: First, expand (x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225.\n\n3. 623(x + 5): That's 623x + 3115.\n\n4. -2015: That's just a constant term.\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms together:\n\ng(x) = (x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- The x³ term: 1x³.\n\n- The x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².\n\n- The x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.\n\n- The constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:\n\n125 - 1225 = -1100.\n\n-1100 + 3115 = 2015.\n\n2015 - 2015 = 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.\n\nWait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. Hmm, so it's a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 1, and the coefficient of x² is -34. Therefore, using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. That matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in expanding, let me go through the expansion again quickly.\n\n(x + 5)³: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125. Correct.\n\n-49(x + 5)²: -49(x² + 10x + 25) = -49x² - 490x - 1225. Correct.\n\n623(x + 5): 623x + 3115. Correct.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nx³ +15x² +75x +125 -49x² -490x -1225 +623x +3115 -2015.\n\nCombine x³: x³.\n\nx²: 15 -49 = -34.\n\nx: 75 -490 +623 = 75 + (623 -490) = 75 + 133 = 208.\n\nConstants: 125 -1225 +3115 -2015.\n\n125 -1225 = -1100.\n\n-1100 +3115 = 2015.\n\n2015 -2015 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, g(x) is indeed x³ -34x² +208x, and the sum of its roots is 34.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that shifting the function horizontally doesn't change the shape of the graph, just its position. So, the roots are shifted, but their sum changes by the amount shifted times the number of roots. Since it's a cubic, there are three roots, each shifted by -5, so the total shift in the sum is -15, leading to 49 -15 =34. That also makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 34 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the roots of \\( g \\) is \\boxed{34}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \\), we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \\( f(x) \\), the sum of the roots is given by the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) term divided by the coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) term, which is \\( \\frac{49}{1} = 49 \\).\n\nSince \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\), the roots of \\( g(x) \\) are the roots of \\( f(x) \\) shifted by -5.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 \\theta}\\) is the same as \\(\\sec^2 \\theta\\), and similarly, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta}\\) is \\(\\csc^2 \\theta\\).

I know that \\(\\sec^2 \\theta = 1 + \\tan^2 \\theta\\) and \\(\\csc^2 \\theta = 1 + \\cot^2 \\theta\\). Maybe substituting these in could simplify things.\n\nSo, substituting, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + 1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + 1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the constants, that's \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\), so now we have:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with multiple angles, using complementary angles or some addition formulas might be useful.\n\nLooking at the angles: 10°, 20°, and 40°. I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, but I don't see an immediate pattern. Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are related through doubling angles. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for \\(\\tan 3\\theta\\) or something similar? Let me recall that \\(\\tan 3\\theta = \\frac{3\\tan \\theta - \\tan^3 \\theta}{1 - 3\\tan^2 \\theta}\\). Maybe that could be useful if I can relate these angles somehow.\n\nWait, 10°, 20°, and 40° are all related through doubling: 10°, 20° is 2*10°, 40° is 2*20°, and 80° is 2*40°, but I don't know if that's directly helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe using the identity for \\(\\tan(A + B)\\) or \\(\\tan(A - B)\\). Let me see if I can express some of these terms in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates \\(\\tan \\theta\\) and \\(\\cot \\theta\\). Since \\(\\cot \\theta = \\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta)\\), so maybe I can express all terms in terms of tangent.\n\nLet me try that. So, \\(\\cot 20^\\circ = \\tan 70^\\circ\\) and \\(\\cot 40^\\circ = \\tan 50^\\circ\\). So, substituting back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHmm, so now I have three tangent squared terms: 10°, 50°, and 70°. I wonder if there's a relationship between these angles. Let me note that 10° + 50° = 60°, and 50° + 70° = 120°, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, 10°, 50°, and 70° are all related to 60°, which is a nice angle. Maybe I can use some identity involving 60°. Let me think about the tangent addition formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that for angles adding up to 90°, their tangents multiply to 1. For example, \\(\\tan 10^\\circ \\tan 80^\\circ = 1\\), but 80° isn't directly in our expression. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe using the identity that \\(\\tan^2 \\theta + \\tan^2 (60^\\circ - \\theta) + \\tan^2 (60^\\circ + \\theta) = 9\\). Is that a real identity? Let me check for a specific angle.\n\nLet me test it with \\(\\theta = 10^\\circ\\). Then, \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ\\). Wait, that's exactly the terms I have! So, if this identity holds, then the sum would be 9. Let me verify this.\n\nI think the identity is indeed \\(\\tan^2 \\theta + \\tan^2 (60^\\circ - \\theta) + \\tan^2 (60^\\circ + \\theta) = 9\\). Let me see if that's correct.\n\nLet me compute each term for \\(\\theta = 10^\\circ\\):\n\n- \\(\\tan 10^\\circ \\approx 0.1763\\), so \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ \\approx 0.0311\\)\n- \\(\\tan 50^\\circ \\approx 1.191753592\\), so \\(\\tan^2 50^\\circ \\approx 1.420\\)\n- \\(\\tan 70^\\circ \\approx 2.747477\\), so \\(\\tan^2 70^\\circ \\approx 7.548\\)\n\nAdding them up: 0.0311 + 1.420 + 7.548 ≈ 9.0. Wow, that's exactly 9. So, the identity holds for \\(\\theta = 10^\\circ\\). Therefore, the sum of these three tangent squared terms is 9.\n\nSo, going back to our expression:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ = 3 + 9 = 12\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, we have \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ\\), which is 9, so adding the 3 gives 12. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the original expression after substitution was:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nBut then I converted \\(\\cot 20^\\circ\\) to \\(\\tan 70^\\circ\\) and \\(\\cot 40^\\circ\\) to \\(\\tan 50^\\circ\\), so the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWhich is 3 + 9 = 12. So, the total expression is 12.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 10^\\circ} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 20^\\circ} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 40^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n\\sec^2 10^\\circ + \\csc^2 20^\\circ + \\csc^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nExpressed in terms of tangent and cotangent:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + 1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + 1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThen, since \\(\\cot \\theta = \\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta)\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\cot 20^\\circ = \\tan 70^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cot 40^\\circ = \\tan 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nAnd as per the identity, \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\tan^2 50^\\circ + \\tan^2 70^\\circ = 9\\), so total is 3 + 9 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 12.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe using another identity or calculating numerically.\n\nLet me compute each term numerically:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 10^\\circ}\\):\n\nFirst, \\(\\cos 10^\\circ \\approx 0.984807753\\), so \\(\\cos^2 10^\\circ \\approx 0.96984631\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{0.96984631} \\approx 1.03112889\\).\n\n2. \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 20^\\circ}\\):\n\n\\(\\sin 20^\\circ \\approx 0.342020143\\), so \\(\\sin^2 20^\\circ \\approx 0.116977778\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{0.116977778} \\approx 8.555723205\\).\n\n3. \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 40^\\circ}\\):\n\n\\(\\sin 40^\\circ \\approx 0.6427876097\\), so \\(\\sin^2 40^\\circ \\approx 0.4131759112\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{0.4131759112} \\approx 2.420352248\\).\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n1.03112889 + 8.555723205 + 2.420352248 ≈ 1.0311 + 8.5557 + 2.4204 ≈ 12.0072.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 12.0072, which is very close to 12. Considering the approximations in the decimal places, it's likely that the exact value is 12.\n\nTherefore, the expression evaluates to 12.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Maybe using the identity for \\(\\tan 3\\theta\\). Let me recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 3\\theta = \\frac{3\\tan \\theta - \\tan^3 \\theta}{1 - 3\\tan^2 \\theta}\n\\]\n\nIf I set \\(\\theta = 10^\\circ\\), then \\(3\\theta = 30^\\circ\\), and \\(\\tan 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). So, plugging in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{3\\tan 10^\\circ - \\tan^3 10^\\circ}{1 - 3\\tan^2 10^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\(t = \\tan 10^\\circ\\). Then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3}(1 - 3t^2) = 3(3t - t^3)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(\\sqrt{3} - 3\\sqrt{3} t^2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(9t - 3t^3\\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} - 3\\sqrt{3} t^2 - 9t + 3t^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} - \\sqrt{3} t^2 - 3t + t^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[\nt^3 - \\sqrt{3} t^2 - 3t + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps directly, but maybe if I can find a relationship between \\(t = \\tan 10^\\circ\\), \\(u = \\tan 50^\\circ\\), and \\(v = \\tan 70^\\circ\\).

Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.\n\nFirst, modular inverse. If t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23, that means when I multiply t by t + 2, the result should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. In other words, t*(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So, I can write that as an equation:\n\nt(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes:\n\nt² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to make it a standard quadratic equation:\n\nt² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.\n\nSo, I need to solve this quadratic congruence equation modulo 23. Since 23 is a prime number, I can use some methods from number theory to solve this.\n\nOne approach is to complete the square. Let me try that. The equation is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. To complete the square, I can write it as:\n\nt² + 2t + 1 ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nBecause I added 1 to both sides to complete the square. So, (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nNow, I need to find t such that (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. This means that t + 1 is a square root of 2 modulo 23. So, I need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23.\n\nI remember that for a prime modulus p, if a is a quadratic residue modulo p, then it has two square roots. So, I need to find integers x such that x² ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nLet me try to compute the squares modulo 23 to see which numbers squared give 2.\n\nLet me list the squares of numbers from 1 to 11 modulo 23 because beyond 11, the squares will repeat due to symmetry (since (23 - x)² ≡ x² mod 23).\n\n1² = 1 mod 23\n2² = 4 mod 23\n3² = 9 mod 23\n4² = 16 mod 23\n5² = 25 ≡ 2 mod 23. Oh, wait, 5² is 25, which is 2 mod 23. So, 5 is a square root of 2 mod 23.\n\nSimilarly, since 23 - 5 = 18, 18² should also be 2 mod 23. Let me check: 18² = 324. Dividing 324 by 23: 23*14=322, so 324 - 322 = 2. Yes, 18² ≡ 2 mod 23.\n\nSo, the square roots of 2 mod 23 are 5 and 18.\n\nTherefore, t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 or t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23.\n\nSolving for t:\n\nCase 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 4 mod 23.\n\nCase 2: t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 17 mod 23.\n\nSo, the solutions are t ≡ 4 or 17 mod 23.\n\nBut the problem states that t must be an odd integer.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that \\(\\tan^{-1}(x)\\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \\(x\\). Similarly, \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving an angle whose cotangent is \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\). I wonder if there's a relationship between these two functions that I can use here.\n\nWait, I recall that \\(\\cot^{-1}(y)\\) is the same as \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)\\) for positive \\(y\\). So, if I let \\(y = \\frac{1}{x}\\), then \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). Is that right? Let me check with an example. If \\(x = 1\\), then \\(\\cot^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\tan^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), so yes, that seems correct. So, in this case, \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). That simplifies things a bit.\n\nSo, substituting that into the original equation, I get:\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1}(x) + \\tan^{-1}(x) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( 2 \\tan^{-1}(x) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nAlright, so now I have \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}\\), where \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). I remember the double-angle identity for sine: \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta\\). So, substituting that in, I get:\n\\[\n2\\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nBut I also know that \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\), so I can express \\(\\sin\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos\\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Let me draw a right triangle where the opposite side is \\(x\\) and the adjacent side is 1, so that \\(\\tan\\theta = x/1 = x\\). Then, the hypotenuse would be \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\sin\\theta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\\) and \\(\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\\). Plugging these into the equation:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nSo, that gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nNow, I can cross-multiply to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n2x \\cdot 3 = 1 \\cdot (x^2 + 1)\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n6x = x^2 + 1\n\\]\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -6\\), and \\(c = 1\\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2}\n\\]\nSimplifying \\(\\sqrt{32}\\) as \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\), we get:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(x = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nBut wait, I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.\n\nLet me consider the original equation again:\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1} (x) + \\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nWe found that \\(\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 2\\tan^{-1}(x)\\). But is this always true?\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check that step. I said that \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\), but is that always the case?\n\nI know that \\(\\cot^{-1}(y) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)\\) when \\(y > 0\\). So, if \\(x > 0\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{x} > 0\\), and the identity holds. However, if \\(x < 0\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{x} < 0\\), and \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\) would be in a different range.\n\nWait, actually, the range of \\(\\cot^{-1}(y)\\) is usually \\((0, \\pi)\\), similar to \\(\\tan^{-1}(y)\\) which is \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). So, if \\(y\\) is positive, \\(\\cot^{-1}(y)\\) is in \\((0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\), and if \\(y\\) is negative, it's in \\((\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\). Similarly, \\(\\tan^{-1}(y)\\) is in \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\), so for negative \\(y\\), it's in \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)\\).\n\nSo, if \\(x\\) is positive, then \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is positive, and \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). But if \\(x\\) is negative, then \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is negative, and \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\) would be in \\((\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\), whereas \\(\\tan^{-1}(x)\\) would be in \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)\\). So, in that case, \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\neq \\tan^{-1}(x)\\).\n\nTherefore, my earlier substitution only holds when \\(x > 0\\). If \\(x < 0\\), I need to adjust the equation accordingly.\n\nSo, let's consider two cases: \\(x > 0\\) and \\(x < 0\\).\n\n**Case 1: \\(x > 0\\)**\n\nAs before, \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\), so the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\sin(2\\tan^{-1}(x)) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nWhich leads to the quadratic equation and solutions \\(x = 3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Since \\(x > 0\\), both solutions are positive because \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5.828\\) and \\(3 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.172\\), both positive. So, both are valid in this case.\n\n**Case 2: \\(x < 0\\)**\n\nHere, \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is negative, so \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\) is in \\((\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\). Let me denote \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). Since \\(x < 0\\), \\(\\theta\\) is in \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)\\). Let me also denote \\(\\phi = \\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\), which is in \\((\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\).\n\nI need to find \\(\\sin(\\theta + \\phi)\\). Let me see if I can express \\(\\phi\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\).\n\nSince \\(\\phi = \\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\), and \\(x < 0\\), let me set \\(x = -a\\) where \\(a > 0\\). Then, \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{1}{a}\\), so \\(\\phi = \\cot^{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\). I know that \\(\\cot^{-1}(-y) = \\pi - \\cot^{-1}(y)\\) for \\(y > 0\\). So, \\(\\phi = \\pi - \\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\).\n\nBut \\(\\cot^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(a)\\), so \\(\\phi = \\pi - \\tan^{-1}(a)\\). Since \\(a = -x\\), and \\(x < 0\\), \\(a > 0\\). Therefore, \\(\\phi = \\pi - \\tan^{-1}(-x)\\).\n\nBut \\(\\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\\tan^{-1}(x)\\), so \\(\\phi = \\pi + \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, \\(\\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\\tan^{-1}(x)\\), so \\(\\phi = \\pi - (-\\tan^{-1}(x)) = \\pi + \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). Hmm, but \\(\\tan^{-1}(x)\\) is negative because \\(x < 0\\), so \\(\\pi + \\tan^{-1}(x)\\) would be in \\((\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\), which is \\((\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi)\\), which matches the range of \\(\\phi\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\phi = \\pi + \\tan^{-1}(x)\\). So, the sum \\(\\theta + \\phi\\) is:\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\pi + \\tan^{-1}(x) = 2\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\pi\n\\]\nSo, the original equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\sin(2\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\pi) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nBut \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\pi) = -\\sin\\alpha\\), so:\n\\[\n-\\sin(2\\tan^{-1}(x)) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nWhich implies:\n\\[\n\\sin(2\\tan^{-1}(x)) = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nSo, similar to before, let me set \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(x)\\), so:\n\\[\n\\sin(2\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nAgain, using the double-angle identity:\n\\[\n2\\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nExpressing \\(\\sin\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos\\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(x < 0\\), let me represent \\(x = -a\\) where \\(a > 0\\). Then, \\(\\tan\\theta = x = -a\\), so in the right triangle, the opposite side is \\(-a\\) (but since lengths are positive, we can consider the magnitude), adjacent side is 1, hypotenuse is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + 1}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\sin\\theta = \\frac{-a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}\\) and \\(\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}\\). Plugging into the equation:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{-a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{-a}{a^2 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{a}{a^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nWhich is the same equation as in the positive case:\n\\[\n\\frac{2a}{a^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\n6a = a^2 + 1\n\\]\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\\[\na^2 - 6a + 1 = 0\n\\]\nSolving this quadratic equation:\n\\[\na = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = 3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(a > 0\\), both solutions are valid because \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} > 0\\) and \\(3 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.172 > 0\\).

Both lines are given in parametric form, which is good because I remember that parametric equations are pretty straightforward for lines. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.\n\nThe first line is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAnd the second line is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nHmm, the problem says they are parallel, which makes sense because the direction vectors look like they might be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that. The direction vector of the first line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and the direction vector of the second line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\). If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is exactly the direction vector of the second line. So yes, they are parallel because their direction vectors are scalar multiples (specifically, multiplied by 2). That means the lines don't intersect and are indeed parallel, so the distance between them should be constant.\n\nNow, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that the formula involves taking a vector connecting any two points on the lines and then projecting it onto a vector that's perpendicular to the direction of the lines. The length of this projection gives the distance. Alternatively, I think the formula is something like the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting the two points, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Let me recall the exact formula.\n\nI think the distance \\(d\\) between two parallel lines can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}|}{|\\vec{v}|}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the direction vector of the lines, and \\(\\vec{w}\\) is the vector connecting any two points on the two lines.\n\nSo, let me define the points on each line. Let's take the points when the parameters \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) are zero. For the first line, when \\(t = 0\\), the point is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). For the second line, when \\(u = 0\\), the point is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\). So, the vector connecting these two points is:\n\\[\n\\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\\\ -3 - (-10) \\\\ 6 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nOkay, so \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). The direction vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) from the first line. Since the lines are parallel, I can use either direction vector, but since the second one is just a multiple, it might be simpler to use the first one.\n\nNow, I need to compute the cross product of \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\). Let me write that out. The cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 \\\\ v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 \\\\ v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n- \\(v_1 = 2\\), \\(v_2 = -9\\), \\(v_3 = -2\\)\n- \\(w_1 = -8\\), \\(w_2 = 7\\), \\(w_3 = 5\\)\n\nSo, computing each component:\n1. First component: \\(v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 = (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 + 14 = -31\\)\n2. Second component: \\(v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 = (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6\\)\n3. Third component: \\(v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 = (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58\\)\n\nSo, the cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -31 \\\\ 6 \\\\ -58 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, I need the magnitude of this cross product. The magnitude \\(|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}|\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \\sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364}\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n- \\((-31)^2 = 961\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n- \\((-58)^2 = 3364\\)\n\nAdding them up: \\(961 + 36 = 997\\), then \\(997 + 3364 = 4361\\). So, the magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{4361}\\).\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 961 + 36 is indeed 997, and 997 + 3364. Let me compute 997 + 3364:\n\n997 + 3000 = 3997\n\n3997 + 364 = 4361. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, \\(|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}| = \\sqrt{4361}\\). Hmm, I wonder if 4361 is a perfect square. Let me check. 66 squared is 4356, which is close. 66^2 = 4356, so 4361 is 66^2 + 5, which is 4356 + 5 = 4361. So, it's not a perfect square. So, I'll just leave it as \\(\\sqrt{4361}\\) for now.\n\nNext, I need the magnitude of the direction vector \\(\\vec{v}\\). The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), so its magnitude is:\n\\[\n|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \\sqrt{89}\n\\]\nSo, \\(|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{89}\\).\n\nNow, plugging these into the distance formula:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}|}{|\\vec{v}|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4361}}{\\sqrt{89}}\n\\]\nI can simplify this by rationalizing or combining the square roots:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{\\frac{4361}{89}}\n\\]\nLet me compute 4361 divided by 89. Let's see, 89 times 49 is 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361. So, 4450 - 89 = 4361, so 89*49=4361. Therefore, \\(\\frac{4361}{89} = 49\\). So, the square root of 49 is 7.\n\nWait, that's a nice simplification! So, \\(d = \\sqrt{49} = 7\\).\n\nWait, let me verify that division again. 89 times 49: 89*40=3560, 89*9=801, so 3560+801=4361. Yes, that's correct. So, 4361 divided by 89 is indeed 49, so the square root is 7.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two parallel lines is 7 units.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Identified the direction vectors and confirmed they are scalar multiples (2 times), so lines are parallel.\n2. Took points when parameters are zero: (3, -10, 1) and (-5, -3, 6).\n3. Calculated the vector connecting these points: (-8, 7, 5).\n4. Computed the cross product of direction vector (2, -9, -2) and connecting vector (-8, 7, 5):\n   - First component: (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 +14 = -31\n   - Second component: (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 -10 = 6\n   - Third component: (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) =14 -72 = -58\n   So, cross product is (-31, 6, -58)\n5. Calculated the magnitude of cross product: sqrt(961 + 36 + 3364) = sqrt(4361)\n6. Calculated magnitude of direction vector: sqrt(4 + 81 +4) = sqrt(89)\n7. Divided the two magnitudes: sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89) = sqrt(49) =7\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I think the distance is indeed 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe distance between the two parallel lines is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nThe first line is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe second line is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe direction vectors of the lines are \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which are scalar multiples, confirming the lines are parallel.\n\nTo find the distance between the lines, we use the formula involving the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting points on the lines.

Hmm, cross products can be a bit tricky, but I think I remember some properties that might help me here. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me three cross products:\n\n1. a × b = [6, -7, 3]\n2. a × c = [4, 7, 2]\n3. b × c = [1, -7, 18]\n\nAnd I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So maybe I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula:\n\n(u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x\n\nSo applying that to (2b - a) × (3c + a), I can expand it as:\n\n2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a\n\nWait, let me make sure I got the signs right. It's (2b - a) × (3c + a), so expanding it:\n\n2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nYes, that seems right. Now, let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 2b × 3c. I can factor out the scalars, so that's 2*3*(b × c) = 6*(b × c). From the given, b × c is [1, -7, 18], so multiplying by 6 gives [6, -42, 108].\n\nSecond term: 2b × a. Hmm, cross product is anti-commutative, so b × a = - (a × b). Therefore, 2b × a = 2*(-a × b) = -2*(a × b). From the given, a × b is [6, -7, 3], so multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6].\n\nThird term: -a × 3c. Again, scalars can be factored out, so that's -3*(a × c). From the given, a × c is [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].\n\nFourth term: -a × a. Wait, the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, right? So -a × a = -0 = 0. So this term is just zero.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, I have:\n\nFirst term: [6, -42, 108]\nSecond term: [-12, 14, -6]\nThird term: [-12, -21, -6]\nFourth term: [0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, I need to add these four vectors component-wise.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nFirst component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18\n\nSecond component: -42 + 14 + (-21) + 0 = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49\n\nThird component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) + 0 = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96\n\nSo adding them up, the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96].\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst component: 6 (from first term) minus 12 (second term) minus 12 (third term) is indeed -18.\n\nSecond component: -42 (first term) plus 14 (second term) minus 21 (third term) is -42 +14 = -28, then -28 -21 = -49. That's correct.\n\nThird component: 108 (first term) minus 6 (second term) minus 6 (third term) is 108 -12 = 96. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) is [-18, -49, 96].\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't mess up the signs anywhere. Let me go through each term again.\n\nFirst term: 2b × 3c = 6*(b × c) = 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6, -42, 108]. Correct.\n\nSecond term: 2b × a = 2*(b × a) = 2*(-a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]. Correct.\n\nThird term: -a × 3c = -3*(a × c) = -3*[4,7,2] = [-12, -21, -6]. Correct.\n\nFourth term: -a × a = 0. Correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFirst components: 6 -12 -12 +0 = -18\n\nSecond components: -42 +14 -21 +0 = -49\n\nThird components: 108 -6 -6 +0 = 96\n\nYes, that all checks out.

The table provided shows the number of stamps he has from each country for each decade, like the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the table is structured with columns for each decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s) and rows for each country (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain). Each cell in the table represents the number of stamps from that country in that decade.\n\nSo, for the 70s, I need to find out how many stamps he has from each country and then calculate the total cost for each country in the 70s. After that, I can find the total number of stamps in the 70s and the total cost, and then divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to get the average price per stamp.\n\nLet me parse the Asymptote code to get the exact numbers. The code labels each cell with the number of stamps. For the 70s column, which is the third column (since 50s is first, 60s is second, 70s is third, 80s is fourth), the numbers are as follows:\n\n- Brazil: 12 stamps\n- France: 12 stamps\n- Peru: 6 stamps\n- Spain: 13 stamps\n\nWait, let me double-check. The Asymptote code labels each cell with the number of stamps. For the 70s, the cells are:\n\n- 12 (Brazil)\n- 12 (France)\n- 6 (Peru)\n- 13 (Spain)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in the 70s, Juan has 12 stamps from Brazil, 12 from France, 6 from Peru, and 13 from Spain.\n\nNow, each country's stamps have different prices:\n\n- Brazil: $6$ cents each\n- France: $6$ cents each\n- Peru: $4$ cents each\n- Spain: $5$ cents each\n\nSo, I need to calculate the total cost for each country in the 70s and then sum them up.\n\nLet me compute each country's total cost:\n\n1. Brazil: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents\n2. France: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents\n3. Peru: 6 stamps * 4 cents = 24 cents\n4. Spain: 13 stamps * 5 cents = 65 cents\n\nNow, adding these up to get the total cost for the 70s:\n\n72 (Brazil) + 72 (France) + 24 (Peru) + 65 (Spain) = let's compute step by step.\n\n72 + 72 = 144\n\n144 + 24 = 168\n\n168 + 65 = 233 cents\n\nSo, the total cost for all 70s stamps is 233 cents.\n\nNext, I need the total number of stamps in the 70s. That's 12 + 12 + 6 + 13.\n\n12 + 12 = 24\n\n24 + 6 = 30\n\n30 + 13 = 43 stamps\n\nSo, there are 43 stamps in total from the 70s.\n\nNow, the average price per stamp is total cost divided by total number of stamps.\n\nSo, average price = 233 cents / 43 stamps\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n233 divided by 43. Hmm, 43 times 5 is 215, because 40*5=200 and 3*5=15, so 200+15=215.\n\n233 - 215 = 18\n\nSo, 5 with a remainder of 18. So, 5 + 18/43.\n\n18 divided by 43 is approximately 0.4186...\n\nSo, 5.4186... cents.\n\nRounded to the first decimal place, that's 5.4 cents.\n\nWait, let me verify the division again to make sure.\n\n43 into 233:\n\n43*5=215\n\n233-215=18\n\nSo, 18/43 is approximately 0.4186, so total is 5.4186, which is approximately 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a calculator, 233 ÷ 43.\n\nLet me compute 43*5=215, 43*5.4=43*(5 + 0.4)=215 + 17.2=232.2\n\nWait, 43*5.4=232.2, which is just 0.8 less than 233.\n\nSo, 5.4 + (0.8/43) ≈ 5.4 + 0.0186 ≈ 5.4186, which is still approximately 5.4186, so 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute 233 ÷ 43:\n\n43 goes into 233 how many times?\n\n43*5=215, as above.\n\n233-215=18.\n\nBring down a zero: 180.\n\n43 goes into 180 four times (43*4=172), remainder 8.\n\nBring down another zero: 80.\n\n43 goes into 80 once (43*1=43), remainder 37.\n\nBring down another zero: 370.\n\n43 goes into 370 eight times (43*8=344), remainder 26.\n\nBring down another zero: 260.\n\n43 goes into 260 six times (43*6=258), remainder 2.\n\nSo, the decimal is 5.4186..., so 5.4186...\n\nRounded to the first decimal place, it's 5.4.\n\nWait, but sometimes when the second decimal is 5 or more, we round up. Here, the second decimal is 1, which is less than 5, so we keep it as 5.4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 5.4186 is 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal place because the second decimal is 1, which is less than 5, so we don't round up.\n\nWait, but actually, 5.4186 is approximately 5.42 when rounded to the second decimal, but since the question asks for the first decimal, it's 5.4.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The number is 5.4186. The first decimal is 4, the second is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we don't round up the first decimal. So, it's 5.4.\n\nAlternatively, if the number was 5.45, we would round up to 5.5, but here it's 5.4186, so 5.4.\n\nTherefore, the average price per stamp in the 70s is approximately 5.4 cents.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the number of stamps in the 70s:\n\nBrazil: 12\n\nFrance: 12\n\nPeru: 6\n\nSpain: 13\n\nTotal: 12+12=24, 24+6=30, 30+13=43. That's correct.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nBrazil: 12*6=72\n\nFrance: 12*6=72\n\nPeru: 6*4=24\n\nSpain:13*5=65\n\nTotal cost: 72+72=144, 144+24=168, 168+65=233. Correct.\n\n233 divided by 43: 5.4186... So, 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe average price per 70s stamp is calculated by dividing the total cost of all 70s stamps by the total number of 70s stamps. \n\nTotal cost = (12×6) + (12×6) + (6×4) + (13×5) = 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 cents.\n\nTotal stamps = 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 stamps.\n\nAverage price = 233 / 43 ≈ 5.4186, which rounds to 5.4 cents.\n\n$\\boxed{5.4}$", "answer": "5.4 \\text{ cents}"}

They also tell me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me draw a rough sketch. Since AD is parallel to BC, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC. Let me label the vertices in order: A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, sides AB and CD are the non-parallel sides.\n\nNow, AC is one of the diagonals, and it's perpendicular to CD. That means when AC meets CD at point C, they form a right angle. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use some properties of trapezoids and angle bisectors. Let me recall that in a trapezoid, the area is given by the formula: (1/2)*(sum of the two bases)*height. Here, the area is 42, so (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = 42. But I don't know the lengths of AD, BC, or the height yet.\n\nSince AC is an angle bisector, maybe I can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem. In triangle ABD, if AC bisects angle BAD, then the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments created on side BD. Wait, but BD isn't necessarily a side here. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle. So, the area of triangle ACD would be (1/2)*AC*CD. If I can find AC and CD, I can compute this area.\n\nBut I don't know AC or CD. Maybe I can express them in terms of other sides or angles. Let me denote some variables. Let me let angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, angle ACD is 90 degrees. So, in triangle ACD, angle at C is 90, angle at A is θ, so angle at D must be 90 - θ.\n\nWait, but in trapezoid ABCD, AD is parallel to BC, so angle BAD and angle ABC are supplementary. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the trapezoid. Since AD || BC, the height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between AD and BC. Let me denote this height as h. So, the area is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*h = 42.\n\nNow, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal, maybe I can find some relations using right triangles. Let me consider triangle ACD. It's a right triangle with legs AC and CD, and hypotenuse AD. So, AD = sqrt(AC² + CD²).\n\nAlso, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is angle at A. So, angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Let me denote AB as one of the sides. Maybe I can express AB in terms of AC and some trigonometric functions.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, if AC is the angle bisector, then by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, no, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide side BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.\n\nBut BD is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, (AB)/(AD) = (BC)/(CD). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, the Angle Bisector Theorem says that if a bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle ABD, if AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, then it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, (AB)/(AD) = (BC)/(CD). Wait, but BD is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is perpendicular to CD, maybe I can set up coordinates such that calculations are easier.\n\nLet me assume that AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point A is at (0,0), and point D is at (d,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, point B must be somewhere along the y-axis, say at (0, h), and point C would be at (c, h). Wait, but then AC is the diagonal from (0,0) to (c, h), and CD is from (c, h) to (d,0). Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nLet me compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(c - 0) = h/c. The slope of CD is (0 - h)/(d - c) = (-h)/(d - c). Since they are perpendicular, (h/c)*(-h/(d - c)) = -1. So, (h²)/(c(d - c)) = 1. Therefore, h² = c(d - c).\n\nAlso, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is the angle at A between AB and AD. Since AB is from (0,0) to (0, h), which is vertical, and AD is from (0,0) to (d,0), which is horizontal. So, angle BAD is 90 degrees, and AC bisects it, so angle BAC is 45 degrees. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, if angle BAD is 90 degrees, and AC bisects it, then each angle is 45 degrees. So, angle BAC = angle CAD = 45 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle? Wait, no, triangle ABC is not necessarily a right triangle. Wait, but AC is the angle bisector, making angle BAC 45 degrees.\n\nWait, in coordinate terms, if AC makes a 45-degree angle with AB, which is vertical, then the slope of AC should be tan(45) = 1. But the slope of AC is h/c, so h/c = 1, which means h = c. So, h = c.\n\nBut earlier, we had h² = c(d - c). Since h = c, substituting, we get c² = c(d - c). Dividing both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0), we get c = d - c, so 2c = d, so d = 2c.\n\nSo, d = 2c, and h = c. So, point D is at (2c, 0), point C is at (c, c), and point B is at (0, c). Wait, point B is at (0, h) which is (0, c). So, coordinates are: A(0,0), B(0,c), C(c,c), D(2c,0).\n\nNow, let's compute the area of the trapezoid ABCD. The formula is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. AD is the length from A(0,0) to D(2c,0), which is 2c. BC is the length from B(0,c) to C(c,c), which is c. The height is the vertical distance between the two bases, which is c (since AD is at y=0 and BC is at y=c). So, area = (1/2)*(2c + c)*c = (1/2)*(3c)*c = (3/2)c².\n\nGiven that the area is 42, so (3/2)c² = 42. Solving for c²: c² = (42*2)/3 = 28. So, c² = 28, so c = sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7).\n\nNow, I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Points A(0,0), C(c,c), D(2c,0). The area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates: (1/2)| (x_A(y_C - y_D) + x_C(y_D - y_A) + x_D(y_A - y_C) ) |.\n\nPlugging in the coordinates: (1/2)| 0*(c - 0) + c*(0 - 0) + 2c*(0 - c) | = (1/2)| 0 + 0 - 2c² | = (1/2)*| -2c² | = (1/2)*(2c²) = c².\n\nSince c² = 28, the area of triangle ACD is 28.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify another way. Since triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD. AC has length sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2). CD has length sqrt( (2c - c)² + (0 - c)² ) = sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2). So, both legs are c*sqrt(2), so area is (1/2)*(c*sqrt(2))*(c*sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*(2c²) = c² = 28. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the area of triangle ACD is 28.\n</think>\n\nThe area of triangle ACD is \\boxed{28}.", "answer": "28"}

Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. It's √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2. Alright, I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with square roots in equations, it's often helpful to eliminate the radicals by squaring both sides. That should simplify things a bit. So, if I square both sides of the equation, I can get rid of the square roots. Let me try that.\n\nSquaring the left side: (√(2x)/√(3x - 1))². That should be equal to (2x)/(3x - 1). And squaring the right side: (3/2)² is 9/4. So now, my equation becomes (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.\n\nAlright, now I have a proportion here. I can cross-multiply to solve for x. So, cross-multiplying gives me 2x * 4 = 9 * (3x - 1). Let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 2x * 4 is 8x. Right side: 9*(3x - 1) is 27x - 9. So now, the equation is 8x = 27x - 9.\n\nHmm, okay, let's get all the x terms on one side. I'll subtract 8x from both sides to get 0 = 19x - 9. Wait, that's 27x - 8x is 19x, so 0 = 19x - 9. Then, adding 9 to both sides gives 9 = 19x. So, x is 9/19.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, I should check if this solution is valid in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. So, let me plug x = 9/19 back into the original equation and see if it holds true.\n\nFirst, compute √(2x). 2x is 2*(9/19) which is 18/19. So, √(18/19). Then, compute √(3x - 1). 3x is 27/19, so 27/19 - 1 is 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. So, √(8/19).\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is √(18/19)/√(8/19). Let's simplify that. The denominators are the same, so it's √18 / √8. Which is √(18/8). Simplify 18/8 to 9/4, so √(9/4) is 3/2. Which is exactly the right side of the equation. So, yes, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, x = 9/19 is the correct solution.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2.\n\nSquare both sides: (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.\n\nCross-multiplying: 8x = 27x - 9.\n\nSubtract 8x: 0 = 19x - 9.\n\nAdd 9: 9 = 19x.\n\nSo, x = 9/19. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nAnd when I checked by plugging back in, it worked out. So, I think that's solid.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward, and the check confirms the solution.

I need to find the probability that the line segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the problem. Imagine a circle with four points on its circumference. These points are placed randomly, so their positions are independent of each other. The question is about the probability that when I connect A to B and C to D, these two chords intersect each other inside the circle.\n\nI remember that for two chords to intersect inside a circle, the four points must be arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if I go around the circle, I should encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D or some rotation of that order. If they are in order like A, B, C, D, then the chords AB and CD won't intersect because they are on opposite sides of the circle.\n\nSo, the key here is the arrangement of the four points. Since the points are chosen randomly, all possible orderings are equally likely. I think the number of ways the four points can be arranged around the circle is related to permutations, but since the circle doesn't have a fixed starting point, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, when dealing with points on a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! for n points because rotations are considered the same. But in this case, since we're dealing with four points, the number of distinct orderings is (4-1)! = 6. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should fix one point and arrange the others relative to it. Let's fix point A at a certain position on the circle. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are determined relative to A. Since the circle is continuous, the exact positions don't matter, only their order around the circumference.\n\nSo, fixing A, the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 different orders around the circle. Each of these orders is equally likely because the points are chosen independently and uniformly.\n\nNow, out of these 6 possible arrangements, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list them:\n\n1. A, B, C, D\n2. A, B, D, C\n3. A, C, B, D\n4. A, C, D, B\n5. A, D, B, C\n6. A, D, C, B\n\nWait, actually, since we fixed A, the order is determined by the positions of B, C, D. So, the possible orderings are the permutations of B, C, D. Let me think of them as sequences starting from A and going clockwise.\n\nSo, the possible orderings are:\n\n1. A, B, C, D\n2. A, B, D, C\n3. A, C, B, D\n4. A, C, D, B\n5. A, D, B, C\n6. A, D, C, B\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to check if AB and CD intersect.\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n1. A, B, C, D: Here, AB is from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Since B and C are adjacent, and D is after C, the chords AB and CD don't intersect because they are on opposite sides of the circle.\n\n2. A, B, D, C: AB is from A to B, CD is from D to C. Since D is between B and C, CD is a chord that goes from D to C, which is adjacent to B. So, AB is from A to B, and CD is from D to C. Do they intersect? Let me draw this mentally. A is fixed, then B, then D, then C. So, AB is a chord from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Since C is next to D, CD is a small chord near D and C. AB is a chord from A to B, which is on the other side. So, they don't intersect.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the order. If the points are A, B, D, C, then the chords AB and CD would not cross because AB is between A and B, and CD is between C and D, which are on the opposite side.\n\n3. A, C, B, D: Here, AB is from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Let's see the order: A, then C, then B, then D. So, AB is from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, does AB cross CD? Let me imagine: A is first, then C, then B, then D. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, these two chords would cross each other because AB goes from A to B, passing through the area where CD is from C to D. So, yes, they intersect.\n\n4. A, C, D, B: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, C, D, B. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is between C and D. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D. So, do they intersect? Let me visualize: A, then C, then D, then B. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is between C and D. So, these chords would intersect because AB passes through the area where CD is. So, yes, they intersect.\n\n5. A, D, B, C: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, B, C. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, AB is a chord from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, do they intersect? Let me think: A, D, B, C. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, these chords would intersect because AB is crossing over the area where CD is. So, yes, they intersect.\n\n6. A, D, C, B: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, C, B. So, AB is from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after A. Wait, no, CD is from C to D, which is after A? Wait, no, the order is A, D, C, B. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in this order? Wait, no, in the order A, D, C, B, moving clockwise, D comes after A, then C comes after D, then B comes after C. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in the clockwise order. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in the order A, D, C, B, moving clockwise, the points are A, then D, then C, then B. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in this order. So, CD would actually be a chord that goes from C back to D, which is counterclockwise. But in terms of intersection, does that matter? Hmm, maybe not, because chords are just straight lines regardless of direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the arcs. If the points are in the order A, D, C, B, then AB is from A to B, which is a long chord going from A to B, passing through the area where D and C are. CD is from C to D, which is a chord between C and D, which are adjacent in this order. So, do AB and CD intersect? Let me visualize: A is first, then D, then C, then B.

(작은) $\\angle ADC$의 각도는 몇 도입니까?", "response": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two circles with the same center D. One has a radius of 1, and the other has a radius of 2. So, the bigger circle is twice as big as the smaller one. The problem mentions a shaded area, and it says that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of angle ADC, which is the angle at point D between points A and C. Hmm, I think points A and C must be points where the shaded area is defined, maybe where the two circles intersect or something like that.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"작은\" which is Korean for \"small.\" So, it's asking for the measure of the small angle ADC. So, angle ADC is the smaller angle between the two points A and C on the circles.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in my mind. There's a center D, with two concentric circles. The smaller one has radius 1, the larger one radius 2. The shaded area is some region, and its total area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, the area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. Therefore, the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what this shaded area is. Since there are two circles, maybe the shaded area is a segment or a sector of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle? Or perhaps it's a lens-shaped area where the two circles overlap? Wait, but since they have the same center, they don't overlap in a lens shape; they are concentric. So, the area between them would be an annulus. But the problem mentions a shaded area, which is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. So, maybe it's a sector of the annulus?\n\nWait, if the circles are concentric, then any sector of the larger circle minus the corresponding sector of the smaller circle would form a sort of ring segment. So, the area of such a segment would be (1/2)*R²θ - (1/2)*r²θ, where θ is the central angle in radians. So, the area would be (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ.\n\nGiven that, the shaded area is (1/2)*(2² - 1²)*θ = (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. And this area is equal to (5/3)π. So, setting up the equation:\n\n(3/2)*θ = (5/3)π\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nθ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π radians.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the measure of angle ADC in degrees. So, I need to convert radians to degrees. Since π radians is 180 degrees, θ in degrees is (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"작은\" which is the small angle. So, if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would actually be 160 degrees because the total around a point is 360 degrees. Wait, no, 200 degrees is the angle, but since it's a central angle, the smaller angle would be the minimum between θ and 360 - θ. So, if θ is 200 degrees, the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But wait, 200 degrees is more than 180, so the smaller angle is 160 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. The area of the shaded region is (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π. So, θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians. Converting that to degrees: 10π/9 * (180/π) = 200 degrees. So, the central angle is 200 degrees, but since we're asked for the smaller angle, it's 360 - 200 = 160 degrees.\n\nWait, but is the shaded area a sector of the annulus? Or is it something else? Let me think again. If the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, then yes, the area would be (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle. But in that case, the area would be (1/2)*R²*(θ - sinθ) - (1/2)*r²*(θ - sinθ). But that seems more complicated, and the problem doesn't mention anything about segments, just the total shaded area. So, I think it's more likely that it's a sector area.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If the shaded area is a sector of the annulus, then the area is (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, plugging in R=2, r=1, we get (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. And this equals (5/12)*Area of larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So, (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π, so θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians, which is 200 degrees. So, the central angle is 200 degrees, but since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees.\n\nWait, but 200 degrees is the angle, and the smaller angle would be 160 degrees because 360 - 200 = 160. So, the measure of the small angle ADC is 160 degrees.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the area calculation. The area of the annulus sector is indeed (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, with R=2, r=1, it's (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. Setting that equal to (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So, (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π. Solving for θ: θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians. Converting to degrees: 10π/9 * (180/π) = 200 degrees. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the small angle ADC is 160 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe measure of the small angle ADC is \\boxed{160} degrees.", "answer": "120"}

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I remember that there are product-to-sum formulas, but I'm not sure if they apply directly here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sine addition and subtraction formulas. Let me think.\n\nThe expression is a product of two sine functions, each involving arcsin terms. Let me denote \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\). So, the expression becomes \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)\\). That seems a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I remember that there's a product identity for sine functions: \\(\\sin A \\sin B = \\frac{1}{2} [\\cos(A - B) - \\cos(A + B)]\\). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me set \\(A = \\alpha + \\beta\\) and \\(B = \\beta - \\alpha\\). Then, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta - \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} [\\cos((\\alpha + \\beta) - (\\beta - \\alpha)) - \\cos((\\alpha + \\beta) + (\\beta - \\alpha))]\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the arguments inside the cosines:\n\nFirst term: \\((\\alpha + \\beta) - (\\beta - \\alpha) = \\alpha + \\beta - \\beta + \\alpha = 2\\alpha\\)\n\nSecond term: \\((\\alpha + \\beta) + (\\beta - \\alpha) = \\alpha + \\beta + \\beta - \\alpha = 2\\beta\\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} [\\cos(2\\alpha) - \\cos(2\\beta)]\n\\]\n\nAlright, so now I need to compute \\(\\cos(2\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\cos(2\\beta)\\). Since \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\), I can use the double-angle identity for cosine: \\(\\cos(2\\theta) = 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\theta\\).\n\nLet's compute \\(\\cos(2\\alpha)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\alpha) = 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, compute \\(\\cos(2\\beta)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\beta) = 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging these back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \\frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I set \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\). Then, I used the product identity correctly, which transformed the product into a difference of cosines. Then, I applied the double-angle formula correctly for both \\(\\cos(2\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\cos(2\\beta)\\). The calculations for each cosine term seem right: 0.4 squared is 0.16, times 2 is 0.32, subtracted from 1 gives 0.68. For 0.5, squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5, subtracted from 1 gives 0.5. Then, subtracting 0.5 from 0.68 gives 0.18, and half of that is 0.09.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem without using the product identity. Let me try another method to verify.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)\\) separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\\). Using the sine addition formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) = \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, compute \\(\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)\\) using the sine subtraction formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha) = \\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha - \\cos \\beta \\sin \\alpha\n\\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n[\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta] \\cdot [\\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha - \\cos \\beta \\sin \\alpha]\n\\]\n\nLet me expand this product:\n\nFirst, multiply \\(\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta\\) with each term in the second bracket:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\cdot \\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha = \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\cdot (-\\cos \\beta \\sin \\alpha) = -\\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply \\(\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta\\) with each term in the second bracket:\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cdot \\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha = \\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cdot (-\\cos \\beta \\sin \\alpha) = -\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta\n\\]\n\nSo, combining all these terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta + \\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta - \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta\n\\]\n\nNotice that the first and last terms cancel each other out:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta - \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\n\\[\n- \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta + \\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta\n\\]\n\nFactor this expression:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta\n\\]\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n\\[\n(\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta)^2 - (\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta)^2\n\\]\n\nWhich is a difference of squares, so it factors as:\n\n\\[\n(\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta - \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta)(\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta)\n\\]\n\nWait, but that seems like going in circles because the original product was \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)\\), which is similar to this. Maybe I should compute the numerical values instead.\n\nGiven that \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\), let's compute \\(\\sin \\alpha = 0.4\\), \\(\\sin \\beta = 0.5\\). Then, we can find \\(\\cos \\alpha\\) and \\(\\cos \\beta\\) using the Pythagorean identity: \\(\\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}\\).\n\nCompute \\(\\cos \\alpha\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\alpha = \\sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \\sqrt{0.84} \\approx 0.9165\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\cos \\beta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \\sqrt{0.75} \\approx 0.8660\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the expression \\(\\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta\\):\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\cos^2 \\alpha\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9165)^2 \\approx 0.84\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\sin^2 \\beta\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta \\approx 0.84 \\times 0.25 = 0.21\\)\n\nNext, compute \\(\\sin^2 \\alpha\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.4)^2 = 0.16\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\cos^2 \\beta\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.8660)^2 \\approx 0.75\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta \\approx 0.16 \\times 0.75 = 0.12\\)\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n\\[\n0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09\n\\]\n\nSo, the product is 0.09, which matches the result I got earlier using the product identity. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as \\(\\sin(A + B)\\sin(A - B)\\), which is a known identity. Wait, actually, the identity is \\(\\sin(A + B)\\sin(A - B) = \\sin^2 A - \\sin^2 B\\). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, indeed, using the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(A + B)\\sin(A - B) = \\sin^2 A - \\sin^2 B\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, if I let \\(A = \\beta\\) and \\(B = \\alpha\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\beta + \\alpha)\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha) = \\sin^2 \\beta - \\sin^2 \\alpha\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly the expression I had earlier: \\(\\sin^2 \\beta - \\sin^2 \\alpha\\). So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 0.5 - \\sin^2 0.4 = (0.5)^2 - (0.4)^2 = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09\n\\]\n\nWow, that was much simpler! I should have thought of that identity earlier. It directly gives the result without going through the product expansion.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 0.09. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 0.09.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute it numerically using approximate values.\n\nCompute \\(\\arcsin 0.4\\): Let's find the angle whose sine is 0.4. Using a calculator, \\(\\arcsin 0.4 \\approx 0.4115\\) radians.\n\nCompute \\(\\arcsin 0.5\\): That's a standard angle, \\(\\pi/6\\) or approximately 0.5236 radians.\n\nNow, compute \\(\\alpha + \\beta \\approx 0.4115 + 0.5236 = 0.9351\\) radians.\n\nCompute \\(\\sin(0.9351)\\): Using a calculator, \\(\\sin(0.9351) \\approx 0.8078\\).\n\nNext, compute \\(\\beta - \\alpha \\approx 0.5236 - 0.4115 = 0.1121\\) radians.\n\nCompute \\(\\sin(0.1121)\\): Using a calculator, \\(\\sin(0.1121) \\approx 0.1119\\).\n\nNow, multiply these two results: \\(0.8078 \\times 0.1119 \\approx 0.0903\\), which is approximately 0.09. So, that confirms the result numerically.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 0.09.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{0.09}.\n</think>\n\nLet \\(\\alpha = \\arcsin 0.4\\) and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin 0.5\\). The given expression is \\(\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)\\).\n\nUsing the identity for the product of sines, we have:\n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta - \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} [\\cos(2\\alpha) - \\cos(2\\beta)]\n\\]\n\nWe compute \\(\\cos(2\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\cos(2\\beta)\\) using the double-angle identity \\(\\cos(2\\theta) = 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\alpha) = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 0.68\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\beta) = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 0.5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \\frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{0.09}\\).", "answer": "\\frac{9}{100}"}

I need to figure out how many ways there are to form a subcommittee of 5 people, but with the condition that each party must have at least one member in the subcommittee. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the total number of ways to choose a group without any restrictions is calculated using the combination formula. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of people is 8 Republicans + 6 Democrats = 14 people. If there were no restrictions, the number of ways to choose 5 people would be C(14, 5). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(14, 5) = 14! / (5! * (14 - 5)!) = (14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 2002.\n\nBut wait, that's without any restrictions. The problem says that each party must have at least one member. So, I can't have a subcommittee that's all Republicans or all Democrats. Therefore, I need to subtract the cases where all 5 are Republicans or all 5 are Democrats.\n\nLet me calculate those two cases separately.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose all Republicans: there are 8 Republicans, so choosing 5 from them is C(8, 5). Let me compute that:\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * (8 - 5)!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose all Democrats: there are 6 Democrats, so choosing 5 from them is C(6, 5). Calculating that:\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * (6 - 5)!) = 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of invalid subcommittees (all Republicans or all Democrats) is 56 + 6 = 62.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid subcommittees is the total number without restrictions minus the invalid ones:\n\n2002 - 62 = 1940.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal number of ways: C(14,5) is indeed 2002. All Republicans: C(8,5) is 56, and all Democrats: C(6,5) is 6. So, 56 + 6 is 62. Subtracting that from 2002 gives 1940. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it by considering the different possible distributions of Republicans and Democrats in the subcommittee. Since each party must have at least one member, the possible splits are:\n\n- 1 Republican and 4 Democrats\n- 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats\n- 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats\n- 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat\n\nI can calculate each of these and sum them up.\n\nLet's compute each case:\n\n1. 1R and 4D: C(8,1) * C(6,4)\n   - C(8,1) = 8\n   - C(6,4) = 15\n   - So, 8 * 15 = 120\n\n2. 2R and 3D: C(8,2) * C(6,3)\n   - C(8,2) = 28\n   - C(6,3) = 20\n   - So, 28 * 20 = 560\n\n3. 3R and 2D: C(8,3) * C(6,2)\n   - C(8,3) = 56\n   - C(6,2) = 15\n   - So, 56 * 15 = 840\n\n4. 4R and 1D: C(8,4) * C(6,1)\n   - C(8,4) = 70\n   - C(6,1) = 6\n   - So, 70 * 6 = 420\n\nNow, adding all these up: 120 + 560 + 840 + 420.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n120 + 560 = 680\n\n680 + 840 = 1520\n\n1520 + 420 = 1940\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. That gives me more confidence that 1940 is the correct answer.\n\nI think both methods confirm that the number of ways is 1940. So, I can be pretty sure that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways is \\boxed{1940}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party, we start by calculating the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 without any restrictions.

Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Alright, I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst, I remember that to get rid of a cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. That should help me simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, the left side becomes just x² - 4x + 4, and the right side becomes 16 cubed. Let me calculate 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... let me do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nNow, my equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Hmm, okay, so I can rewrite this as a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set it to zero. That gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation becomes x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. I need to solve for x. I can use the quadratic formula here, which is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values into the formula.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-4)², which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 times 1 times (-4092), which is 4 * (-4092) = -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 16 + 16368 is 16384. That's a perfect square, right? Because 128 squared is 16384. Let me check: 128 times 128. 100 times 128 is 12800, 28 times 128 is 3584, so 12800 + 3584 is 16384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the square root of the discriminant is 128. Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [-(-4) ± 128] / (2*1). Simplifying that, -(-4) is 4, so x = [4 ± 128] / 2. That gives me two possible solutions.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66. Second solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62. But wait, the problem specifies that x is a positive number, so I can discard the negative solution. Therefore, x must be 66.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. If x is 66, then x² is 66 squared, which is 4356. Then, 4x is 4*66 = 264. So, x² - 4x + 4 is 4356 - 264 + 4. Let's compute that: 4356 - 264 is 4092, and 4092 + 4 is 4096. The cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, since 16 cubed is 4096. So, that checks out.\n\nI think I did everything correctly. I cubed both sides, solved the quadratic, checked the discriminant, found the roots, and verified the positive solution.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify it.\n\nFirst, I notice that the angles inside the cosines are doubling each time: 2π/15, then 4π/15, then 8π/15, and then 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, so maybe I can use the identity that relates cos(θ) to cos(θ - 2π) or something like that. Let me check: cos(16π/15) is the same as cos(16π/15 - 2π) which is cos(-14π/15). But cosine is even, so that's equal to cos(14π/15). Hmm, 14π/15 is still more than π/2, but maybe that's useful later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity for multiple angles or product-to-sum formulas. I remember that the product of cosines can sometimes be expressed as a sum, but with four terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines with angles in geometric progression.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one. Let me recall. I think it's something like cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n}θ) = something involving sine functions. Let me try to remember or derive it.\n\nI recall that sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so maybe I can use that recursively. Let's see:\n\nIf I have sin(θ) * 2 cosθ = sin(2θ)\nThen sin(2θ) * 2 cos(2θ) = sin(4θ)\nSimilarly, sin(4θ) * 2 cos(4θ) = sin(8θ)\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, if I multiply all these together, I get:\n\nsin(θ) * 2 cosθ * 2 cos(2θ) * 2 cos(4θ) * ... * 2 cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)\n\nSo, rearranging, the product of the cosines is sin(2^{n+1}θ) / (2^{n} sinθ)\n\nIn this case, I have four cosines: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), cos(16π/15). Let me see if this fits the pattern.\n\nLet me set θ = 2π/15. Then the angles are θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. So n=3 because we have four terms (from θ to 8θ, which is 2^3 θ). So according to the formula, the product would be sin(16θ) / (2^3 sinθ). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, θ = 2π/15, so 16θ = 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. But 32π/15 is more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π to find the equivalent angle: 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15).\n\nSo the product becomes sin(2π/15) / (8 sin(2π/15)) = 1/8.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\nProduct = [cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * cos8θ] = sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ)\n\nWith θ = 2π/15, 16θ = 32π/15, which is equivalent to 32π/15 - 2π = 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15)) = 1/8.\n\nBut wait, the original product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). I used θ=2π/15, so the last term is cos(16θ) = cos(32π/15) = cos(2π/15) because cos is periodic with period 2π. But wait, cos(32π/15) is actually cos(32π/15 - 2π) = cos(2π/15). So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the formula, the product is up to cos(8θ), which is cos(16π/15). So yes, that's correct. So the product is indeed 1/8.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula says that the product from k=0 to n of cos(2^k θ) is sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). Wait, no, in my earlier thought, I think I might have miscounted the number of terms. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is for the product of cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * ... * cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). So in this case, we have four terms: θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ, which is n=3 because 2^3=8. So the product is sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.\n\nWait, but let me compute the product numerically to check. Let me compute each cosine term:\n\ncos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135\ncos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691\ncos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045\ncos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781\n\nMultiplying them together: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118; 0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639; -0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625. Hmm, 0.0625 is 1/16, not 1/8. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So either my formula is wrong or my calculation is wrong. Let me check the numerical values again.\n\nWait, cos(8π/15) is cos(96°), which is indeed negative because 96° is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. Similarly, cos(16π/15) is cos(192°), which is also negative because 192° is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. So multiplying two negative terms gives positive, so the overall product should be positive. But according to my calculation, it's approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 1/8. So there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula is:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ)\n\nWait, in my case, I have four terms: cosθ, cos2θ, cos4θ, cos8θ, which is k=0 to 3, so n=3. Therefore, the product should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.\n\nBut numerically, I got approximately 1/16. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me recalculate the product more accurately.\n\nCompute each cosine:\n\ncos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135454576\ncos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691306064\ncos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045284633\ncos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781476007\n\nNow multiply them step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 ≈ 0.6118034009\n\nNext, 0.6118034009 * (-0.1045284633) ≈ -0.0639000000\n\nThen, -0.0639000000 * (-0.9781476007) ≈ 0.0625\n\nSo the product is approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 1/8. So there's a conflict. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the product up to cos(2^n θ), but in my case, the last term is cos(16π/15), which is cos(8θ) where θ=2π/15. So n=3, so the product should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). But 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.\n\nBut numerically, I get 1/16. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula is:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ)\n\nSo for n=3, it's sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So that's correct.\n\nBut in my case, the product is cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * cos8θ, which is exactly the product from k=0 to 3 of cos(2^k θ). So according to the formula, it should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.\n\nBut numerically, I get 1/16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me check the values again.\n\nWait, cos(8π/15) is cos(96°), which is approximately -0.1045284633. Cos(16π/15)=cos(192°)=cos(180°+12°)= -cos(12°)≈-0.9781476007.\n\nSo the product is:\n\ncos(24°)*cos(48°)*cos(96°)*cos(192°) ≈ 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 * (-0.1045284633) * (-0.9781476007)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 ≈ 0.6118034009\n\nThen, 0.6118034009 * (-0.1045284633) ≈ -0.0639000000\n\nThen, -0.0639000000 * (-0.9781476007) ≈ 0.0625\n\nSo 0.0625 is 1/16, not 1/8. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, my formula must be incorrect or I'm applying it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the product up to cos(2^n θ), but in my case, the last term is cos(8θ)=cos(16π/15). So n=3, so the product is sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). But 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π", "answer": "\\frac{1}{16}"}

There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base is BC, and the height AM splits BC into two equal parts, BM and MC. So, M is the midpoint of BC. The height AM is 11, so the coordinates might help here. Maybe I can place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0), and then B and C on the x-axis at (-x,0) and (x,0) respectively. That way, AM is the vertical line from (0,11) to (0,0), and BC is the base from (-x,0) to (x,0).\n\nPoint D is on AM, and AD is 10. Since AM is 11, D must be 10 units below A, so its coordinates would be (0,1). That makes sense because from A at (0,11), moving down 10 units along the y-axis gets us to (0,1).\n\nNow, the key part is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.\n\nSince ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let's denote each of those angles as φ. So, in triangle ABC, the angles are θ at A, and φ at B and C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have θ + 2φ = 180°, so φ = (180° - θ)/2.\n\nNow, looking at triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C form triangle BDC, and angle at D is 3θ. I need to find some relationship here. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.\n\nBut before that, let me note the coordinates of all points:\n\n- A: (0,11)\n- M: (0,0)\n- B: (-x,0)\n- C: (x,0)\n- D: (0,1)\n\nSo, BD is the line from (-x,0) to (0,1), and CD is the line from (x,0) to (0,1). Let me compute the lengths of BD and CD.\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\nBD = sqrt[ (0 - (-x))² + (1 - 0)² ] = sqrt(x² + 1)\nCD = sqrt[ (0 - x)² + (1 - 0)² ] = sqrt(x² + 1)\n\nSo, BD = CD. That means triangle BDC is also isosceles with BD = CD. Therefore, the base angles at B and C in triangle BDC are equal. Let me denote each of those angles as ψ. So, in triangle BDC, the angles are 3θ at D, and ψ at B and C. So, 3θ + 2ψ = 180°, which gives ψ = (180° - 3θ)/2.\n\nBut wait, in triangle ABC, the angles at B and C are φ, which is (180° - θ)/2. So, in triangle BDC, the angles at B and C are ψ, which is (180° - 3θ)/2. Hmm, is there a relationship between φ and ψ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the slopes of BD and CD, then compute the angles. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry to find the angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me think about triangle ABD and triangle ACD.\n\nWait, since BD = CD, triangle BDC is isosceles, so the angles at B and C are equal, which I already noted. So, angle at B in triangle BDC is ψ, and angle at C is ψ. So, angle BDC is 3θ.\n\nBut in triangle ABC, angle at B is φ, which is (180° - θ)/2. So, in triangle BDC, angle at B is ψ, which is (180° - 3θ)/2.\n\nBut angle at B in triangle ABC is φ, and angle at B in triangle BDC is ψ. Are these related? Maybe, because point D is on AM, which is the altitude. So, perhaps the angles at B in ABC and BDC are related through some other triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.\n\nIn triangle BDC, sides BD = CD = sqrt(x² + 1), and BC = 2x. So, sides are BD = CD = sqrt(x² + 1), and BC = 2x.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines on triangle BDC:\n\nBD / sin(angle at C) = BC / sin(angle at D)\n\nSo, sqrt(x² + 1) / sin(ψ) = 2x / sin(3θ)\n\nBut ψ = (180° - 3θ)/2, so sin(ψ) = sin( (180° - 3θ)/2 ) = sin(90° - 3θ/2) = cos(3θ/2)\n\nSo, sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2) = 2x / sin(3θ)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1) * sin(3θ) = 2x * cos(3θ/2)\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nNow, let's look at triangle ABC. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, and height AM = 11, so AB = AC = sqrt(x² + 11²) = sqrt(x² + 121). The base BC is 2x.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ, so using the Law of Cosines:\n\nBC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cosθ\n\nBut AB = AC, so:\n\n(2x)² = 2*(sqrt(x² + 121))² - 2*(sqrt(x² + 121))² * cosθ\n\nSimplify:\n\n4x² = 2*(x² + 121) - 2*(x² + 121)*cosθ\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2x² = (x² + 121) - (x² + 121)*cosθ\n\nRearrange:\n\n2x² - (x² + 121) = - (x² + 121)*cosθ\n\nSo,\n\nx² - 121 = - (x² + 121)*cosθ\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n121 - x² = (x² + 121)*cosθ\n\nSo,\n\ncosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)\n\nThat's equation (1).\n\nNow, going back to the equation from triangle BDC:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1) * sin(3θ) = 2x * cos(3θ/2)\n\nLet me express sin(3θ) in terms of sinθ and cosθ. Using the identity:\n\nsin(3θ) = 3sinθ - 4sin³θ\n\nBut I also have cos(3θ/2). Maybe using the identity for cos(3θ/2) in terms of cosθ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of cosθ, since I have cosθ from equation (1).\n\nLet me denote cosθ = c, so c = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)\n\nThen, sinθ = sqrt(1 - c²) = sqrt(1 - [(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]² )\n\nBut that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe using multiple-angle identities.\n\nAlternatively, let me express sin(3θ) and cos(3θ/2) in terms of sinθ and cosθ.\n\nFirst, sin(3θ) = 3sinθ - 4sin³θ\n\nAnd cos(3θ/2) can be expressed using the half-angle formula:\n\ncos(3θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos(3θ))/2 )\n\nBut cos(3θ) can be expressed as 4cos³θ - 3cosθ.\n\nSo, cos(3θ) = 4c³ - 3c\n\nTherefore, cos(3θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + 4c³ - 3c)/2 )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1) * [3sinθ - 4sin³θ] = 2x * sqrt( (1 + 4c³ - 3c)/2 )\n\nBut c = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²), so let's compute 4c³ - 3c:\n\n4c³ - 3c = 4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry to find the angles.\n\nSince D is at (0,1), B is at (-x,0), and C is at (x,0). So, vectors BD and CD can be found.\n\nVector BD is from B to D: (0 - (-x), 1 - 0) = (x,1)\nVector CD is from C to D: (0 - x, 1 - 0) = (-x,1)\n\nThe angle at D, angle BDC, is the angle between vectors DB and DC. Wait, no, angle BDC is at D, so it's the angle between DB and DC.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of vectors, the angle at D is between vectors DB and DC. So, vectors from D to B and D to C.\n\nVector DB is B - D = (-x - 0, 0 - 1) = (-x, -1)\nVector DC is C - D = (x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1)\n\nSo, the angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC, which is 3θ.\n\nThe cosine of the angle between two vectors u and v is (u · v)/(|u||v|)\n\nSo, cos(angle BDC) = [(-x)(x) + (-1)(-1)] / (|DB| |DC|)\n\nCompute numerator: (-x)(x) + (-1)(-1) = -x² + 1\n\nDenominator: |DB| = sqrt(x² + 1), |DC| = sqrt(x² + 1), so denominator is (sqrt(x² + 1))² = x² + 1\n\nSo,\n\ncos(3θ) = (-x² + 1)/(x² + 1)\n\nBut from earlier, we have cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)\n\nSo, we have two expressions:\n\ncos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)  [from vectors]\nand\ncosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)  [from triangle ABC]\n\nWe can use the triple angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ\n\nSo, substituting cosθ from equation (1):\n\ncos(3θ) = 4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]\n\nBut we also have cos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)\n\nSo, equate the two expressions:\n\n4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)] = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)\n\nLet me denote t = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n4t³ - 3t = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)\n\nBut t = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). Let me express (1 - x²)/(1 + x²) in terms of t.\n\nLet me compute (1 - x²)/(1 + x²):\n\nLet me denote s = x². Then,\n\n(1 - s)/(1 + s) = ?\n\nBut t = (121 - s)/(121 + s)\n\nLet me solve for s in terms of t:\n\nt = (121 - s)/(121 + s)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nt(121 + s) = 121 - s\n\n121t + ts = 121 - s\n\nBring terms with s to one side:\n\nts + s = 121 - 121t\n\ns(t + 1) = 121(1 - t)\n\nSo,\n\ns = [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1)\n\nNow, (1 - s)/(1 + s) = [1 - s]/[1 + s] = [ (1 + s) - 2s ] / (1 + s) = 1 - [2s/(1 + s)]\n\nBut maybe it's better to express (1 - s)/(1 + s) in terms of t.\n\nFrom s = [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1), then:\n\n1 - s = 1 - [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1) = [ (t + 1) - 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ t + 1 - 121 + 121t ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ (1 + 121t) + (t - 121) ] / (t + 1 )\n\nWait, maybe better to compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\n1 - s = 1 - [121(1 - t)/(t + 1)] = [ (t + 1) - 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ t + 1 - 121 + 121t ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ (t + 121t) + (1 - 121) ] / (t + 1 )\n\n= [ 122t -", "answer": "11 \\sqrt{5} + 11"}

Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression x⁴ + 4x² is a quartic polynomial, but it's actually a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it simpler. Let me try that.\n\nLet y = x². Then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. So now I have a quadratic inequality in y. I can split this into two separate inequalities:\n\n1. y² + 4y > -4\n2. y² + 4y < 21\n\nI'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions must be satisfied.\n\nStarting with the first inequality: y² + 4y > -4.\n\nLet me rewrite this as y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, that's because I can add 4 to both sides to get y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, y² + 4y + 4 is a perfect square. It factors to (y + 2)² > 0.\n\nSo, (y + 2)² > 0. Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all real numbers except where the square is zero. So, y + 2 ≠ 0, which means y ≠ -2. But y is x², and x² is always non-negative, so y can't be negative. Therefore, y ≠ -2 is automatically satisfied because y is at least 0. So, the first inequality is always true for all real x. That means I don't have to worry about the first part; it doesn't restrict the solution set.\n\nNow, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.\n\nLet me rewrite this as y² + 4y - 21 < 0. To solve this quadratic inequality, I need to find the roots of the equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100. That's a perfect square, so the roots will be rational.\n\nSo, y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2.\n\nCalculating both roots:\n\n1. y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n2. y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7\n\nSo, the roots are y = 3 and y = -7. Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of y² is positive), the inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0 will hold between the roots. That is, for y between -7 and 3.\n\nBut wait, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y can't be less than 0. Therefore, the lower bound of y is 0, not -7. So, the solution for y is 0 ≤ y < 3.\n\nTranslating back to x, since y = x², we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. Taking square roots, this means that x is between -√3 and √3, but not including the endpoints because x² is strictly less than 3.\n\nSo, x must satisfy -√3 < x < √3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We transformed it into y² + 4y < 21, which gave us y < 3, and since y is non-negative, 0 ≤ y < 3. So, x² < 3, which gives x in (-√3, √3). That seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me test a value inside the interval and outside to make sure.\n\nLet's pick x = 0. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. Is 0 between -4 and 21? Yes, so 0 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's pick x = 2. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32. Is 32 less than 21? No, so x = 2 is not a solution, which is consistent with our interval since 2 is greater than √3 (~1.732).\n\nWhat about x = -2? Similarly, x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32, which is also not less than 21. So, x = -2 is excluded, which is correct.\n\nHow about x = √3? Then x² = 3, so x⁴ + 4x² = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so 21 is not included. Therefore, x cannot be √3 or -√3.\n\nWhat about a number just less than √3, say x = 1.7? x² = 2.89, x⁴ = (2.89)² ≈ 8.3521. Then x⁴ + 4x² ≈ 8.3521 + 11.56 ≈ 19.9121, which is less than 21. So, that works.\n\nAnd a number just above √3, say x = 1.8. x² = 3.24, x⁴ = (3.24)² ≈ 10.4976. Then x⁴ + 4x² ≈ 10.4976 + 12.96 ≈ 23.4576, which is greater than 21. So, that's excluded, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is all real numbers x such that -√3 < x < √3.\n\nI think that's it. So, in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\), we start by substituting \\(y = x^2\\). This transforms the inequality into \\(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\\).\n\nFirst, consider the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y > -4\\):\n- Rewriting it as \\(y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0\\), we get \\((y + 2)^2 > 0\\).\n- This is always true for all real \\(y\\) except \\(y = -2\\). Since \\(y = x^2\\) is non-negative, this condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nNext, consider the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y < 21\\):\n- Rewriting it as \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\), we solve the quadratic equation \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 10}{2}\n  \\]\n  This gives the roots \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\).\n- The quadratic inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) holds for \\( -7 < y < 3\\). Since \\(y = x^2\\) is non-negative, we have \\(0 \\leq y < 3\\).\n\nTranslating back to \\(x\\), we get \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\), which means \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThus, the solution in interval notation is \\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}\\).", "answer": "(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})"}

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or rewrite this expression.\n\nI notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\). Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\), and \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\). So, the entire expression can be written as:\n\n\\[\nxy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nxy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it further or express it in terms of \\( S \\) and \\( P \\). Let me try expanding each term:\n\nFirst, \\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \\), which is the same as the original terms. So, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, another thought: I remember that \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz\n\\]\n\nLooking at the third equation, it's \\( x^2 y + x y^2 + x^2 z + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 = 12 \\). So, that's exactly the left-hand side of the above equation minus \\( 3xyz \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known value of \\( xyz = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nS P - 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\nS P - 12 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\nS P = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, equation (2): \\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nNow, from equation (1): \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\).

{"original_question": "\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\]을(를) 푸세요.", "question": "\\[\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\]을(를) 푸세요.", "response": "Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \\(\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, I need to consider the numerator and the denominator separately because the sign of the fraction depends on the signs of both.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the numerator is the absolute value of \\(x^2 - 81\\), and the denominator is \\(x^2 - 36x\\). I know that absolute values are always non-negative, so the numerator is either positive or zero. But since it's in the numerator, if it's zero, the whole expression becomes zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality because we're looking for values less than zero. So, I can note that the numerator is zero when \\(x^2 - 81 = 0\\), which is when \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -9\\). At these points, the expression is zero, so they won't be part of the solution.\n\nNext, let's factor both the numerator and the denominator to see if I can simplify or find critical points.\n\nStarting with the numerator: \\(|x^2 - 81|\\). That's the absolute value of a difference of squares, so it factors as \\(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, the denominator: \\(x^2 - 36x\\). I can factor out an x, so it becomes \\(x(x - 36)\\). So, the denominator is zero when \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 36\\). These are important points because the expression is undefined at these values, so they can't be part of the solution either.\n\nSo, summarizing the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined: \\(x = -9\\), \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 9\\), and \\(x = 36\\). These points divide the real number line into intervals. I'll need to test each interval to see where the expression is negative.\n\nThe intervals are:\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -9) \\)\n2. \\( (-9, 0) \\)\n3. \\( (0, 9) \\)\n4. \\( (9, 36) \\)\n5. \\( (36, \\infty) \\)\n\nNow, I'll pick a test point from each interval and plug it into the expression to determine the sign.\n\nStarting with the first interval, \\( (-\\infty, -9) \\). Let's choose \\(x = -10\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\\) (positive)\nDenominator: \\((-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460\\) (positive)\nSo, the expression is \\(19/460\\), which is positive. Since we're looking for negative values, this interval doesn't work.\n\nNext interval: \\( (-9, 0) \\). Let's pick \\(x = -5\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(|(-5)^2 - 81| = |25 - 81| = | -56 | = 56\\) (positive)\nDenominator: \\((-5)^2 - 36*(-5) = 25 + 180 = 205\\) (positive)\nSo, the expression is \\(56/205\\), which is positive. Still not what we want.\n\nThird interval: \\( (0, 9) \\). Let's choose \\(x = 1\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = | -80 | = 80\\) (positive)\nDenominator: \\(1^2 - 36*1 = 1 - 36 = -35\\) (negative)\nSo, the expression is \\(80/(-35)\\), which is negative. This interval works because we're looking for where the expression is less than zero.\n\nFourth interval: \\( (9, 36) \\). Let's pick \\(x = 10\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\\) (positive)\nDenominator: \\(10^2 - 36*10 = 100 - 360 = -260\\) (negative)\nSo, the expression is \\(19/(-260)\\), which is negative. This interval also works.\n\nFifth interval: \\( (36, \\infty) \\). Let's choose \\(x = 40\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(|40^2 - 81| = |1600 - 81| = |1519| = 1519\\) (positive)\nDenominator: \\(40^2 - 36*40 = 1600 - 1440 = 160\\) (positive)\nSo, the expression is \\(1519/160\\), which is positive. Doesn't work.\n\nSo, from the test points, the expression is negative in intervals \\( (0, 9) \\) and \\( (9, 36) \\). But wait, I should check if the expression is defined at the endpoints. At \\(x = 0\\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. At \\(x = 9\\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. At \\(x = 36\\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. So, the solution is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative, excluding the critical points.\n\nBut hold on, I should also consider the behavior around \\(x = 9\\). Since the numerator is zero there, but the denominator is \\(9^2 - 36*9 = 81 - 324 = -243\\), which is negative. So, just to the left of 9, the denominator is negative, and the numerator is positive, so the expression is negative. Just to the right of 9, the denominator is still negative because \\(x = 10\\) gives denominator as -260, which is negative, and numerator is positive, so expression is negative. So, the expression is negative on both sides of 9, but at 9 itself, it's zero. So, 9 is not included.\n\nSimilarly, at \\(x = -9\\), the numerator is zero, but the denominator is \\((-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405\\), which is positive. So, just to the left of -9, the numerator is positive, denominator positive, so expression positive. Just to the right of -9, numerator is positive, denominator positive, so expression positive. So, -9 is not included.\n\nAt \\(x = 0\\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. So, we have to exclude 0.\n\nAt \\(x = 36\\), denominator is zero, so undefined.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is \\(x\\) in \\( (0, 9) \\) union \\( (9, 36) \\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any other point where the expression could change sign? I don't think so because the numerator is always positive except at x = 9 and x = -9, where it's zero, and the denominator changes sign at x = 0 and x = 36.\n\nSo, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is between 0 and 36, but excluding 0 and 36. But wait, in the interval \\( (0, 9) \\), the denominator is negative because \\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\\). For x between 0 and 36, x is positive, but (x - 36) is negative, so the product is negative. So, denominator is negative in \\( (0, 36) \\). But the numerator is always positive except at x = 9 and x = -9.\n\nSo, in \\( (0, 9) \\), numerator is positive, denominator negative: expression negative.\n\nIn \\( (9, 36) \\), numerator is positive, denominator negative: expression negative.\n\nSo, the expression is negative in \\( (0, 36) \\), excluding the points where it's zero or undefined. But wait, at x = 9, the expression is zero, so we have to exclude that point. So, the solution is \\( (0, 9) \\cup (9, 36) \\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if the numerator is positive in all these intervals. The numerator is \\(|x^2 - 81|\\), which is always non-negative. So, it's positive except at x = 9 and x = -9. So, in all intervals except at those points, the numerator is positive.\n\nSo, the sign of the expression depends solely on the denominator. So, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is when \\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\). Let's solve that inequality separately.\n\n\\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\)\n\nFactor: \\(x(x - 36) < 0\\)\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. The critical points are x = 0 and x = 36. The parabola opens upwards, so it's negative between the roots. So, the solution is \\(0 < x < 36\\).\n\nBut in this interval, we have to exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which is x = 9 and x = -9. But x = -9 is not in this interval, so only x = 9 is in \\(0 < x < 36\\).

The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. I need to find the maximum possible area of the field. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch it out in my mind. The field is a rectangle, so it has two lengths and two widths. The track goes around it, but instead of just the rectangle's perimeter, it's made up of two straight parts and two semicircular parts. So, the track is like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, right? That makes the track a combination of straight lines and curves.\n\nWait, actually, if the track is surrounding the field, then the straight parts of the track would be the same as the lengths of the rectangle, and the curved parts would be the semicircles on each end. So, the total length of the track would be the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the two semicircles.\n\nLet me denote the length of the rectangle as 'L' and the width as 'W'. Then, the two straight parts of the track would each be length 'L', so together that's 2L. The two semicircular parts would each have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 'W'. Since each semicircle has a circumference of π*(diameter)/2, which is π*W/2. But since there are two semicircles, together they make a full circle, so the total circumference from the curves would be π*W.\n\nSo, the total length of the track is 2L + π*W = 400 meters. That's the constraint given.\n\nNow, the area of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is L*W. I need to maximize this area given the constraint 2L + π*W = 400.\n\nThis sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember from calculus that I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution to solve such problems. Since it's a single constraint, substitution might be simpler here.\n\nLet me express L in terms of W from the constraint equation. So, 2L = 400 - π*W, which means L = (400 - π*W)/2.\n\nNow, substitute this into the area formula: Area = L*W = [(400 - π*W)/2] * W = (400W - π*W²)/2.\n\nSo, the area A(W) = (400W - π*W²)/2. To find the maximum area, I need to find the value of W that maximizes A(W). This is a quadratic function in terms of W, and since the coefficient of W² is negative (-π/2), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by A(W) = aW² + bW + c is at W = -b/(2a). In this case, A(W) = (-π/2)W² + (400/2)W, so a = -π/2 and b = 200.\n\nSo, W = -b/(2a) = -200 / (2*(-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. The standard form is A(W) = aW² + bW + c, so here a = -π/2 and b = 200. So, the vertex is at W = -b/(2a) = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200/(-π) = 200/π. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, the width W that maximizes the area is 200/π meters. Now, let's find the corresponding length L.\n\nFrom earlier, L = (400 - π*W)/2. Plugging W = 200/π into this:\n\nL = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100 meters.\n\nSo, the length is 100 meters and the width is 200/π meters. Now, let's compute the area.\n\nArea = L*W = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π square meters.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify the calculations again.\n\nStarting from the constraint: 2L + πW = 400.\n\nIf W = 200/π, then πW = 200. So, 2L = 400 - 200 = 200, so L = 100. That seems correct.\n\nThen, area is 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π. Yes, that's approximately 6366.1977 square meters, but since the question asks for the exact value, I should leave it in terms of π.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it as (20000/π) m². But let me think if there's another way to represent it.\n\nWait, another approach: sometimes, when dealing with such optimization problems, especially with circles and rectangles, the maximum area occurs when the shape is as close to a square as possible, but in this case, because of the semicircular ends, it's a bit different.\n\nBut in this case, the calculations seem consistent. Let me just recap:\n\n1. The track is made of two straight sides (each length L) and two semicircular ends (each with diameter W).\n2. The total length of the track is 2L + πW = 400.\n3. The area of the field is L*W.\n4. Express L in terms of W: L = (400 - πW)/2.\n5. Substitute into area: A = (400W - πW²)/2.\n6. Take derivative of A with respect to W: dA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW.\n7. Set derivative to zero: 200 - πW = 0 → W = 200/π.\n8. Then L = 100.\n9. Area = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through the steps again quickly.\n\n- Total track length: 2L + πW = 400.\n- Express L: L = (400 - πW)/2.\n- Area: A = L*W = [(400 - πW)/2]*W = (400W - πW²)/2.\n- To maximize A, take derivative: dA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW.\n- Set to zero: 200 - πW = 0 → W = 200/π.\n- Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100.\n- Area = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.\n\nYes, everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the maximum area is 20000 divided by π square meters.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum area of the field is achieved when the width is \\( \\frac{200}{\\pi} \\) meters and the length is 100 meters. The area is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 100 \\times \\frac{200}{\\pi} = \\frac{20000}{\\pi} \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{20000}{\\pi}}", "answer": "\\frac{20000}{\\pi}"}

Hmm, let me try to visualize the triangle first. The Asymptote code shows that it's a right-angled triangle with the right angle at S. So, points R, S, and T form a right triangle with the right angle at S. That means angle R and angle T are the other two angles, and they must add up to 90 degrees since the total in a triangle is 180.\n\nThe Asymptote code also labels the hypotenuse RT as 5 units long. So, RT is the hypotenuse, and RS and ST are the legs. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here if needed.\n\nGiven that sin R is 2/5, I need to find sin T. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, sin R = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle R would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, sin R = ST / RT = 2/5. That means ST = 2 units because 2/5 of 5 is 2.\n\nWait, hold on. If RT is 5 and sin R is 2/5, then ST is 2. So, ST = 2. Now, since it's a right-angled triangle at S, the sides RS and ST are the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse. So, I can find RS using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me write that down:\n\nRS² + ST² = RT²\n\nWe know ST is 2 and RT is 5, so plugging in:\n\nRS² + 2² = 5²\nRS² + 4 = 25\nRS² = 25 - 4\nRS² = 21\nRS = sqrt(21)\n\nOkay, so RS is sqrt(21). Now, I need to find sin T. Let's think about angle T. In triangle RST, angle T is at point T, so the sides relative to angle T are: the opposite side is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT. So, sin T = opposite / hypotenuse = RS / RT.\n\nWe already found RS is sqrt(21) and RT is 5, so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R are ST and RS, respectively. Since sin R = 2/5, that's opposite over hypotenuse, so ST is 2, hypotenuse is 5, so RS is sqrt(21). Then, for angle T, which is at point T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is still RT, which is 5. So, yes, sin T should be sqrt(21)/5.\n\nAlternatively, since in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary, meaning angle R + angle T = 90 degrees. So, sin T would be equal to cos R. Because sin(90 - x) = cos x. So, if sin R = 2/5, then cos R would be sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, sin T = cos R = sqrt(21)/5. That confirms my earlier result.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Given sin R = 2/5 in a right-angled triangle, we found the opposite side ST = 2, hypotenuse RT = 5, then used Pythagoras to find RS = sqrt(21). Then, since sin T is opposite over hypotenuse for angle T, which is RS / RT = sqrt(21)/5. Alternatively, using the co-function identity, sin T = cos R, which also gives sqrt(21)/5. Both methods lead to the same answer, so I feel confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\sin{T}$ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right-angled triangle \\( \\triangle RST \\) with the right angle at \\( S \\), we know that \\( \\sin{R} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).

Then, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But since one of the points is variable (any point on the graph), I think I need to use calculus to minimize the distance function.\n\nLet me recall that the distance between two points \\( (x, y) \\) and \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since the point \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the given graph, I can substitute \\( y \\) with the function \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\).\n\nSo, substituting, the distance becomes \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\). To make it easier, I can square the distance to avoid dealing with the square root, which should give me the same minimum point. So, let me define a function \\( D(x) = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nSimplifying \\( D(x) \\):\n\nFirst, square the second term: \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( D(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( D(x) \\). To do this, I'll take the derivative of \\( D(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\), set it equal to zero, and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( D'(x) \\):\n\nFirst, expand \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\) to make differentiation easier. \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\).\n\nSo, \\( D(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( D(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( D(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nNow, take the derivative:\n\n\\( D'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\right) \\).\n\nCalculating term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\).\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is 0.\n\nSo, \\( D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \\).\n\nTo find critical points, set \\( D'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n\\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the solutions are \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\) which gives \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum distance. Since distance is always positive, I can evaluate \\( D(x) \\) at each critical point and see which is the smallest.\n\nFirst, evaluate at \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( D(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \\frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nNext, evaluate at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\nCompute \\( D(\\sqrt{2}) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x^4 = (\\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^2 = 4 \\).\n\n\\( x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( D(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \\frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \\frac{9}{2} = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( D(-\\sqrt{2}) \\) will be the same as \\( D(\\sqrt{2}) \\) because all terms are even powers, so it's also 2.5.\n\nSo, comparing \\( D(0) = 4.5 \\) and \\( D(\\sqrt{2}) = 2.5 \\), clearly \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\) give a smaller distance.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance occurs at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\). Let's pick \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) for simplicity.\n\nNow, compute the distance at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\nFirst, find \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( (\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nSo, the point is \\( (\\sqrt{2}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\).\n\nNow, compute the distance from the origin:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{ (\\sqrt{2})^2 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 } = \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{4}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{5}{2} } \\).\n\nSimplify \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\):\n\n\\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).

Since 10 is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, this satisfies the condition.\n\nThus, \\( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \\).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed \\( D(x) \\) at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\), I got 2.5, which is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\). So, the squared distance is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\), so the distance is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} \\). That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the point on the graph. When \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( (\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). So, the point is \\( (\\sqrt{2}, -1/\\sqrt{2}) \\). The distance from the origin is indeed \\( \\sqrt{ (\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/\\sqrt{2})^2 } = \\sqrt{2 + 1/2} = \\sqrt{5/2} = \\sqrt{10}/2 \\). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the formula for the distance from a point to a curve. But I think the method I used is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to parametrize the point on the curve as \\( (x, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)) \\) and then find the minimum distance squared, which is \\( x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\). Then, take the derivative, set to zero, which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct.

It's 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3, and it's -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3. I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, that sounds like I need to find the values of x such that f(x) equals 0 and 6, respectively, and then add those x values together.\n\nLet me start with f inverse of 0. That means I need to solve f(x) = 0. Since f is piecewise, I have to check both pieces.\n\nFirst, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 0:\n\n3 - x = 0\n\nSolving for x, I get x = 3. Okay, so that's one solution. But wait, I should check if this x is within the domain of that piece, which is x ≤ 3. Since 3 is equal to 3, it's valid. So, f inverse of 0 is 3.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there's another solution in the other piece? Let me check the second piece for f(x) = 0 as well. The second piece is for x > 3, so f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let me set that equal to 0:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0\n\nI can factor out a -x:\n\n-x(x² - 2x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, either -x = 0, which gives x = 0, but x has to be greater than 3 here, so that's not valid. Or, x² - 2x - 3 = 0. Let's solve that quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2.\n\nSo, x = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or x = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Hmm, both 3 and -1. But in this piece, x has to be greater than 3, so x = 3 is the boundary, but it's not included in this piece. So, x = 3 is already covered in the first piece, and x = -1 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain of this piece either. Therefore, the only solution is x = 3.\n\nSo, f inverse of 0 is 3.\n\nNow, moving on to f inverse of 6. Again, I need to solve f(x) = 6. Let's check both pieces.\n\nFirst, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 6:\n\n3 - x = 6\n\nSolving for x: -x = 6 - 3 = 3, so x = -3. Now, check if x = -3 is in the domain x ≤ 3. Yes, it is. So, that's a valid solution. So, f inverse of 6 is -3? Wait, hold on, is that the only solution?\n\nWait, maybe there's another solution in the second piece. Let me check the second piece for f(x) = 6 as well. The second piece is for x > 3, so f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set that equal to 6:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\nx³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor by grouping.\n\nGroup the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0\n\nFactor out x² from the first group and -3 from the second group:\n\nx²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, factor out (x - 2):\n\n(x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 2 or x² - 3 = 0, which gives x = sqrt(3) or x = -sqrt(3). But wait, in this piece, x has to be greater than 3. So, x = 2 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain. Similarly, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is less than 3, and -sqrt(3) is negative, so also less than 3. Therefore, none of these solutions are valid in the second piece.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = -3 from the first piece. Therefore, f inverse of 6 is -3.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my factoring. I had:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0\n\nI multiplied by -1 to get x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nThen, grouping:\n\n(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0\n\nx²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the roots are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3). None of these are greater than 3, so indeed, no solution in the second piece. So, f inverse of 6 is -3.\n\nTherefore, f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3. So, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor f inverse of 0, I found x = 3, which is correct because f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0. And for f inverse of 6, I found x = -3, because f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6. So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions in the second piece for f(x) = 6. Maybe I made a mistake in factoring or solving.\n\nSo, starting again with f(x) = 6 for x > 3:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6\n\nBring 6 to the left:\n\n-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nx³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nTrying to factor this, maybe I can use rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.\n\nTesting x=1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nx=2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, wait, x=2 is a root. So, I can factor (x - 2) out.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 by (x - 2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  -2  -3  6\n\n          2   0  -6\n\n      1   0  -3  0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² - 3). So, same as before. So, roots are x=2, x=√3, x=-√3. None of these are greater than 3, so no solution in the second piece.\n\nTherefore, f inverse of 6 is indeed -3.\n\nSo, adding f inverse of 0 (which is 3) and f inverse of 6 (which is -3) gives 3 + (-3) = 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that f(x) = 6 could have another solution in the second piece? Maybe I should graph the function or analyze its behavior.\n\nFor x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's see its behavior as x increases beyond 3.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, the -x³ term dominates, so f(x) tends to negative infinity. At x=3, let's compute f(3):\n\nf(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, at x=3, f(x)=0. Then, as x increases beyond 3, f(x) starts at 0 and goes to negative infinity. So, it's decreasing for x > 3.\n\nWait, is that true? Let me check the derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\nf'(x) for x > 3 is derivative of -x³ + 2x² + 3x, which is -3x² + 4x + 3.\n\nAt x=3, f'(3) = -27 + 12 + 3 = -12. So, the slope is negative at x=3, meaning it's decreasing there. Since the leading term is -3x², which is negative, the function is concave down and decreasing for large x. So, it's decreasing for x > 3, starting from f(3)=0 and going down. Therefore, f(x) for x > 3 never reaches 6 because it's decreasing from 0 to negative infinity. So, no solution in the second piece for f(x)=6.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion is correct. f inverse of 6 is -3.\n\nSo, adding f inverse of 0 (3) and f inverse of 6 (-3) gives 0.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm f(-3):\n\nf(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6, correct.\n\nAnd f(3) = 0, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the sum is 0.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( f(x) \\) is defined piecewise. To find \\( f^{-1}(0) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(6) \\), we solve for \\( x \\) in each piece.\n\nFor \\( f^{-1}(0) \\):\n- In the first piece (\\( x \\leq 3 \\)): \\( 3 - x = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 3 \\).\n- In the second piece (\\( x > 3 \\)): Solving \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \\) yields no valid solutions for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nThus, \\( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \\).\n\nFor \\( f^{-1}(6) \\):\n- In the first piece (\\( x \\leq 3 \\)): \\( 3 - x = 6 \\) gives \\( x = -3 \\).\n- In the second piece (\\( x > 3 \\)): Solving \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \\) yields no valid solutions for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nThus, \\( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \\).\n\nAdding these results: \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{0}\\)", "answer": "0"}

It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases. The problem says that from point P, the distances to five of the six vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about the properties of a regular octahedron. I remember that in a regular octahedron, all edges are of equal length, and it's symmetric. The vertices can be considered as points in 3D space. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make this easier.\n\nI recall that a regular octahedron can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,-1). So, let me denote these points as A, B, C, D, E, F respectively. So, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), and F is (0,0,-1).\n\nNow, point P is somewhere in space, and the distances from P to five of these vertices are given. Let me denote the coordinates of P as (x, y, z). Then, the distance from P to each vertex can be written using the distance formula.\n\nSo, the distance from P to A is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from P to B is sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.\n\nDistance to C is sqrt[x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] = 8.\n\nDistance to D is sqrt[x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] = 9.\n\nDistance to E is sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] = 11.\n\nAnd the distance to F is sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2], which is what we need to find.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I have five equations here with three variables x, y, z. That seems overdetermined, but maybe there's a relationship or a trick to find the sixth distance without solving for x, y, z directly.\n\nWait, I remember something about the properties of regular octahedrons and the sum of squares of distances from a point to all vertices. Is there a formula or theorem related to that?\n\nLet me think. For a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to all six vertices is constant, regardless of where the point is. Is that true? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, actually, I think it's related to the concept of the moment of inertia or something in geometry. Maybe the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to all vertices is equal to a constant plus six times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid.\n\nBut in a regular octahedron, the centroid is at the origin (0,0,0) because of the symmetry. So, if that's the case, then the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices should be equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the centroid plus some constant.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For any point P in space, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex of a regular polyhedron can be expressed in terms of the number of vertices, the distance from P to the centroid, and some constant related to the polyhedron.\n\nSpecifically, for a regular octahedron, the formula is:\n\nSum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P - G|^2 + C,\n\nwhere G is the centroid, and C is a constant depending on the octahedron.\n\nSince the centroid G is at (0,0,0), this simplifies to:\n\nSum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + C.\n\nBut I need to find what C is. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the distances from the origin to each vertex.\n\nEach vertex is at a distance of 1 from the origin, right? Because the coordinates are (1,0,0), etc. So, the distance from the origin to each vertex is 1, so the square is 1. There are six vertices, so the sum is 6*1 = 6.\n\nBut wait, in the formula, it's 6|P|^2 + C. So, if I plug in P as the origin, then the sum of the squares of the distances from the origin to each vertex is 6, which should equal 6|0|^2 + C, so C = 6.\n\nTherefore, the formula is:\n\nSum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.\n\nSo, if I can compute the sum of the squares of the given distances, and then use this formula to find the sixth distance.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the distances as d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D, d_E, d_F.\n\nGiven: d_A = 3, d_B = 7, d_C = 8, d_D = 9, d_E = 11, and d_F is unknown.\n\nSo, the sum of squares is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_F^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n11^2 = 121\n\nSo, sum of the known squares: 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n9 + 49 = 58\n\n58 + 64 = 122\n\n122 + 81 = 203\n\n203 + 121 = 324\n\nSo, the sum of the squares of the known distances is 324. Then, adding d_F^2, the total sum is 324 + d_F^2.\n\nAccording to the formula, this should equal 6|P|^2 + 6.\n\nBut wait, I don't know |P|, which is the distance from P to the origin. Hmm, but maybe I can express |P|^2 in terms of the given distances.\n\nWait, let's think again. The formula is:\n\nSum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.\n\nSo, 324 + d_F^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.\n\nBut I don't know |P|^2. Is there another way to find |P|^2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find |P|^2 from the given distances.\n\nWait, let's consider the distance from P to A: sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.\n\nSquaring both sides: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, distance to B: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.\n\nSquaring: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.\n\nIf I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate y^2 and z^2.\n\nSo, (x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9.\n\nCompute left side: (x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x.\n\nRight side: 40.\n\nSo, 4x = 40 => x = 10.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, x = 10.\n\nWait, but hold on, if x is 10, then let's plug back into the first equation.\n\nFrom distance to A: (10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nSo, 9^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = 9 - 81 = -72.\n\nWait, that can't be. y^2 + z^2 can't be negative. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's check the subtraction again.\n\n(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9.\n\nCompute left side: (x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x.\n\nRight side: 40.\n\nSo, 4x = 40 => x = 10.\n\nBut then, plugging back into the first equation:\n\n(10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = -72.\n\nWhich is impossible because squares are non-negative. So, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the distance from P to A is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.\n\nSo, squaring: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, distance to B: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.\n\nSquaring: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n[(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] = 49 - 9.\n\nWhich is 4x = 40 => x = 10.\n\nBut then, as before, plugging back in, we get y^2 + z^2 = -72, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that either the problem is impossible, or I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, but the problem says that such a point P exists, so maybe I made a wrong assumption in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I recalled earlier is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me recall that for any point P, the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the centroid plus 6 times the square of the edge length or something like that.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about the general formula for the sum of squared distances from a point to the vertices of a polyhedron.\n\nIn general, for any point P, the sum of squared distances to the vertices can be expressed as:\n\nSum |P - V_i|^2 = n |P - G|^2 + Sum |V_i - G|^2,\n\nwhere G is the centroid, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, n = 6, and G is the origin.\n\nSo, Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + Sum |V_i|^2.\n\nBut each V_i is at a distance of 1 from the origin, so |V_i|^2 = 1 for each vertex.\n\nTherefore, Sum |V_i|^2 = 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nSum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.\n\nSo, in our case, the sum of the squares of the distances is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_F^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d_F^2 = 324 + d_F^2.\n\nSo, 324 + d_F^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.\n\nBut we also have that |P|^2 is x^2 + y^2 + z^2.\n\nWait, but from the distance to A: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nExpanding that: x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nWhich is |P|^2 - 2x + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, |P|^2 = 9 + 2x - 1 = 8 + 2x.\n\nSimilarly, from the distance to B: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.\n\nExpanding: x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.\n\nWhich is |P|^2 + 2x + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, |P|^2 = 49 - 2x - 1 = 48 - 2x.\n\nSo, from distance to A: |P|^2 = 8 + 2x.\n\nFrom distance to B: |P|^2 = 48 - 2x.\n\nTherefore, 8 + 2x = 48 - 2x.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n8 + 2x = 48 - 2x\n\n2x + 2x = 48 - 8\n\n4x = 40\n\nx = 10.\n\nWait, so x is 10, which is what I got earlier. But then, plugging back into |P|^2 = 8 + 2x = 8 + 20 = 28.\n\nSo, |P|^2 = 28.\n\nBut then, from the distance to A: (10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = -72.\n\nWhich is impossible.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division method where I divide the number by the base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders become the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nSo, I need to convert 629 into base 7 and base 8 separately and then compare the digits to see how many are the same.\n\nLet me start with converting 629 to base 7.\n\n**Converting 629 to Base 7:**\n\nI'll divide 629 by 7 and record the remainders.\n\n1. 629 ÷ 7: 7 goes into 629 how many times? Let's see, 7*89 is 623, which is less than 629. So, 89 times with a remainder of 629 - 623 = 6. So, the first remainder is 6.\n\n2. Now, take 89 and divide by 7. 7*12 is 84, so 12 times with a remainder of 89 - 84 = 5. Second remainder is 5.\n\n3. Next, take 12 and divide by 7. 7*1 is 7, so 1 time with a remainder of 12 - 7 = 5. Third remainder is 5.\n\n4. Now, take 1 and divide by 7. 7 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. Fourth remainder is 1.\n\nSo, writing the remainders from last to first, the base 7 representation is 1 5 5 6. So, 629 in base 7 is 1556₇.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me compute 1*7³ + 5*7² + 5*7 + 6.\n\n1*343 = 343\n\n5*49 = 245\n\n5*7 = 35\n\n6*1 = 6\n\nAdding them up: 343 + 245 = 588, 588 + 35 = 623, 623 + 6 = 629. Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Converting 629 to Base 8:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same process for base 8.\n\n1. 629 ÷ 8: 8*78 is 624, so 78 times with a remainder of 629 - 624 = 5. First remainder is 5.\n\n2. Take 78 and divide by 8. 8*9 is 72, so 9 times with a remainder of 78 - 72 = 6. Second remainder is 6.\n\n3. Take 9 and divide by 8. 8*1 is 8, so 1 time with a remainder of 9 - 8 = 1. Third remainder is 1.\n\n4. Take 1 and divide by 8. 8 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. Fourth remainder is 1.\n\nSo, writing the remainders from last to first, the base 8 representation is 1 1 6 5. So, 629 in base 8 is 1165₈.\n\nWait, let me verify that as well. 1*8³ + 1*8² + 6*8 + 5.\n\n1*512 = 512\n\n1*64 = 64\n\n6*8 = 48\n\n5*1 = 5\n\nAdding them up: 512 + 64 = 576, 576 + 48 = 624, 624 + 5 = 629. Correct.\n\n**Comparing the Digits:**\n\nNow, I have the two numbers:\n\n- Base 7: 1 5 5 6\n- Base 8: 1 1 6 5\n\nI need to compare each digit position to see if they are the same.\n\nLet me write them aligned:\n\nBase 7: 1 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (units)\nBase 8: 1 (thousands place), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (units)\n\nWait, actually, in base 7, the digits are 1,5,5,6, which correspond to 7³, 7², 7¹, 7⁰.\n\nSimilarly, in base 8, the digits are 1,1,6,5, corresponding to 8³, 8², 8¹, 8⁰.\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\nBase 7 digits: [1, 5, 5, 6]\nBase 8 digits: [1, 1, 6, 5]\n\nNow, let's compare each digit position by position:\n\n1. Thousands place: Both have 1. So, that's a match.\n2. Hundreds place: Base7 has 5, Base8 has 1. Not a match.\n3. Tens place: Base7 has 5, Base8 has 6. Not a match.\n4. Units place: Base7 has 6, Base8 has 5. Not a match.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should consider the digits regardless of their position? Or is it per digit position?\n\nWait, the question says \"the same digits\" in their respective representations. So, perhaps it's the digits themselves, regardless of their position. So, for example, in the example given, 121_3 and 413_5, the common digit is 1, which appears in both.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to look at all the digits in both numbers and see how many unique digits are common between them.\n\nSo, let's list the digits in each base:\n\nBase7: 1,5,5,6 → digits are 1,5,6\n\nBase8: 1,1,6,5 → digits are 1,5,6\n\nSo, the digits in base7 are {1,5,6}, and in base8 are {1,5,6}. So, all three digits are common.\n\nWait, but wait, in the example, 121_3 has digits 1 and 2, and 413_5 has digits 4,1,3. So, the common digit is 1, hence one common digit.\n\nSo, in this case, the digits in base7 are 1,5,5,6, so unique digits are 1,5,6.\n\nDigits in base8 are 1,1,6,5, so unique digits are 1,5,6.\n\nSo, the common digits are 1,5,6. So, three digits.\n\nWait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer would be 3.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says, \"the same digits\" in their respective representations. So, it's the number of digits that appear in both representations, regardless of their position.\n\nSo, in the example, 121_3 has digits 1 and 2, and 413_5 has digits 4,1,3. So, the common digit is 1, hence one.\n\nIn our case, base7 has digits 1,5,6, and base8 has digits 1,5,6. So, all three digits are common. So, the number of common digits is 3.\n\nWait, but let me check the base7 and base8 representations again.\n\nBase7: 1556 → digits are 1,5,5,6. So, unique digits: 1,5,6.\n\nBase8: 1165 → digits are 1,1,6,5. So, unique digits: 1,5,6.\n\nSo, yes, all three digits are common. So, the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.\n\nBase7: 629 ÷7=89 rem6; 89 ÷7=12 rem5; 12 ÷7=1 rem5; 1 ÷7=0 rem1. So, digits are 1,5,5,6.\n\nBase8: 629 ÷8=78 rem5; 78 ÷8=9 rem6; 9 ÷8=1 rem1; 1 ÷8=0 rem1. So, digits are 1,1,6,5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the digits in base7 are 1,5,6, and in base8 are 1,5,6. So, all three digits are common.\n\nTherefore, the number of common digits is 3.\n\nWait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer is 3.\n\nBut let me think again. The example says 121_3 and 413_5 have one common digit, which is 1. So, the count is the number of unique digits that appear in both representations.\n\nIn our case, the unique digits in base7 are 1,5,6, and in base8 are 1,5,6. So, all three are common. So, the count is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.\n\nWait, base7: 1*343 +5*49 +5*7 +6= 343+245=588+35=623+6=629. Correct.\n\nBase8:1*512 +1*64 +6*8 +5=512+64=576+48=624+5=629. Correct.\n\nSo, the digits are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of common digits is 3.\n\nWait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three.

I need to find the sum of the coefficients of another polynomial g(x), which is equal to f(x - 1). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. So, if I have a polynomial like g(x) = aₙxⁿ + ... + a₁x + a₀, then the sum of its coefficients is g(1) = aₙ + ... + a₁ + a₀. That makes sense because plugging in x = 1 essentially removes all the x terms, leaving just the coefficients.\n\nSo, if g(x) is equal to f(x - 1), then the sum of the coefficients of g(x) would be g(1). But since g(x) = f(x - 1), substituting x = 1 into g(x) would give me f(1 - 1) = f(0). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, because g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). So, instead of expanding f(x - 1) and then plugging in x = 1, I can just compute f(0). That seems much simpler. Let me verify this logic.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand f(x - 1), I would substitute x - 1 into every x in f(x). So, f(x - 1) would be 3(x - 1)⁴ + 5(x - 1)² - 9(x - 1) - 2. Then, to find the sum of the coefficients, I would set x = 1 in this expanded polynomial. But if I do that, each (x - 1) term becomes (1 - 1) = 0, so f(0) is indeed the result. So, both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I can just compute f(0) to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x). Let's compute f(0):\n\nf(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2.\n\nWait, so the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2? That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand f(x - 1) fully, what would that look like? Let me try that to confirm.\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\n1. 3(x - 1)^4: Let's compute (x - 1)^4. Using the binomial theorem, (x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1. Multiply by 3: 3x⁴ - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.\n\n2. 5(x - 1)^2: (x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5: 5x² - 10x + 5.\n\n3. -9(x - 1): Distribute the -9: -9x + 9.\n\n4. -2: That's just -2.\n\nNow, let's add all these together:\n\n3x⁴ - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3\n+ 5x² - 10x + 5\n-9x + 9\n-2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x⁴ term: 3x⁴\n- x³ term: -12x³\n- x² terms: 18x² + 5x² = 23x²\n- x terms: -12x -10x -9x = -31x\n- constants: 3 + 5 + 9 - 2 = 15\n\nSo, f(x - 1) = 3x⁴ - 12x³ + 23x² - 31x + 15.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in x = 1:\n\ng(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15.\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\n3 - 12 = -9\n\n-9 + 23 = 14\n\n14 - 31 = -17\n\n-17 + 15 = -2.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The sum of the coefficients is indeed -2. Therefore, whether I compute f(0) directly or expand f(x - 1) and then evaluate at x = 1, I get the same result.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is \\boxed{-2}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\), which is equal to \\( f(x - 1) \\), we can evaluate \\( g(1) \\).

The set is unordered, so I just need to find all possible values of these expressions and present them as a set.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic equation, I can use Vieta's formulas to find expressions involving the roots without having to find the roots themselves, which is good because solving a quartic can be complicated.\n\nThe given polynomial is \\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\\). Let me write it in the standard form:\n\n\\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\\).\n\nSo, comparing this to the general quartic equation \\(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\\), the coefficients are:\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = 0\\)\n- \\(c = 0\\)\n- \\(d = 2\\)\n\nVieta's formulas tell us that for the roots \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4\\):\n\n1. \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 = -a = -2\\)\n2. \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = b = 0\\)\n3. \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = -c = 0\\)\n4. \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = d = 2\\)\n\nSo, from Vieta, we have:\n\n- Sum of roots: \\(-2\\)\n- Sum of products two at a time: \\(0\\)\n- Sum of products three at a time: \\(0\\)\n- Product of all roots: \\(2\\)\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the set of expressions \\(\\alpha_i\\alpha_j + \\alpha_k\\alpha_l\\) where each expression is a sum of two products of roots, and each product is of two distinct roots. Since the set is unordered, I just need to find all possible such sums and collect them.\n\nBut wait, how many such expressions are there? For four roots, the number of ways to pair them into two pairs is 3. Specifically, the three pairings are:\n\n1. \\((\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)\\)\n2. \\((\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4)\\)\n3. \\((\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3)\\)\n\nSo, these are the three elements of the set we need to find.\n\nI need to find the values of these three expressions. Let me denote them as:\n\n\\(S_1 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\)\n\n\\(S_2 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4\\)\n\n\\(S_3 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\)\n\nSo, the set is \\(\\{S_1, S_2, S_3\\}\\).\n\nI need to find the values of \\(S_1, S_2, S_3\\). Since the polynomial is symmetric in its roots, these sums might be related in some way, perhaps they are roots of another polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between these sums using Vieta's formulas.\n\nLet me think. I know that the sum of all products two at a time is zero:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 0\\)\n\nSo, if I denote \\(S_1 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\), then the sum of the other two products is \\(S_2 + S_3 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\). Wait, but that's actually equal to the sum of all products two at a time minus \\(S_1\\). So:\n\n\\(S_2 + S_3 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4) = (\\text{sum of all products two at a time}) - (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4) = 0 - S_1 = -S_1\\)\n\nSo, \\(S_2 + S_3 = -S_1\\)\n\nSimilarly, if I consider \\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\\), that would be equal to the sum of all products two at a time, which is zero. So:\n\n\\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\\)\n\nSo, that gives me one equation.\n\nNow, I need more information to find the individual values of \\(S_1, S_2, S_3\\). Perhaps I can find the sum of their squares or the product of these sums.\n\nLet me compute \\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\\). Expanding each square:\n\n\\(S_1^2 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)^2 = \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2^2 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2\\)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\(S_2^2 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4)^2 = \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3^2 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4^2\\)\n\n\\(S_3^2 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3)^2 = \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_4^2 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_4\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3^2\\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2) + (\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4^2) + (\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3^2) + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + 2\\alpha_1\\alpha_4\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nFirst, the squared terms:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3^2\\)\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n\\((\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_1^2\\alpha_4^2) + (\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2)\\)\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1^2(\\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_4^2) + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4^2\\)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that the sum \\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\\) can be expressed in terms of the squares of the products of roots.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider the square of the sum of all products two at a time.\n\nWe know that \\((\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)^2 = 0^2 = 0\\)\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\(\\sum (\\alpha_i\\alpha_j)^2 + 2\\sum (\\alpha_i\\alpha_j)(\\alpha_k\\alpha_l)\\) where \\(i < j\\), \\(k < l\\), and \\((i,j) \\neq (k,l)\\)\n\nBut this seems messy, but maybe we can relate it to \\(S_1, S_2, S_3\\).\n\nWait, actually, the sum \\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\\), as we saw earlier.\n\nAlso, the sum \\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\\) can be related to the squares of the products of roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the products \\(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\\). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute \\(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\\):\n\nFirst, \\(S_1 S_2 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4)\\)\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(S_1 S_3 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3)\\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4\\)\n\nAnd \\(S_2 S_3 = (\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3)\\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\)\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n\\(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = [\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2] + [\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4] + [\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4^2 + \\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4]\\)\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_2\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Similarly, terms with \\(\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_3\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_2\\alpha_3^2\\alpha_4\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_4^2\\): 1 term\n- Terms with \\(\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4^2\\): 1 term\n\nWait, actually, each term is unique, so there are 12 terms in total, but each is a product of three distinct roots multiplied by one root squared.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this differently.

I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, or D. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, so it's equidistant from all four vertices. The ratio AB/AD is given as k, which means if I let AD be of length 'a', then AB would be 'ka'. So, the rectangle has sides of length 'a' and 'ka'.\n\nNow, the problem is about choosing a random point inside this rectangle and determining the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four corners. So, essentially, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point in this region is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D. The probability would then be the area of this region divided by the area of the entire rectangle.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates to make this more concrete. Let's place the rectangle in a coordinate system with O at the origin (0,0). Since O is the center, the coordinates of the vertices can be defined as follows:\n\n- A: (-ka/2, a/2)\n- B: (ka/2, a/2)\n- C: (ka/2, -a/2)\n- D: (-ka/2, -a/2)\n\nWait, hold on, actually, if AB is the length ka and AD is a, then the coordinates should be:\n\n- A: (-ka/2, a/2)\n- B: (ka/2, a/2)\n- C: (ka/2, -a/2)\n- D: (-ka/2, -a/2)\n\nYes, that makes sense because the length AB is ka, so the distance from A to B along the x-axis is ka, and the length AD is a, so the distance from A to D along the y-axis is a.\n\nNow, the center O is at (0,0). So, any point (x,y) inside the rectangle must satisfy -ka/2 ≤ x ≤ ka/2 and -a/2 ≤ y ≤ a/2.\n\nI need to find the set of all points (x,y) such that the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance from (x,y) to each of A, B, C, D.\n\nMathematically, this means:\n\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²] (distance to A)\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²] (distance to B)\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²] (distance to C)\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²] (distance to D)\n\nSince square roots are involved, I can square both sides to eliminate them, which should simplify the inequalities.\n\nStarting with the distance to A:\n\nx² + y² < (x + ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(x + ka/2)² = x² + ka x + (ka/2)²\n(y - a/2)² = y² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\nx² + ka x + (ka/2)² + y² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nSubtracting x² + y² from both sides:\n\n0 < ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nSimplify:\n\nka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0\n\nFactor out 'a' from the first two terms:\n\na(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nDivide both sides by 'a' (assuming a ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's a rectangle):\n\nk x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, when I subtract x² + y² from both sides, I get:\n\n0 < ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nWhich is:\n\n0 < ka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4)\n\nFactor out 'a' from the first two terms:\n\n0 < a(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4)\n\nDivide both sides by 'a' (positive, so inequality remains same):\n\n0 < k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4)\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\nk x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for the distance to B:\n\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx² + y² < (x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(x - ka/2)² = x² - ka x + (ka/2)²\n(y - a/2)² = y² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nAdding them:\n\nx² - ka x + (ka/2)² + y² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < -ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²\n\nSimplify:\n\n-ka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0\n\nFactor out '-a' from the first two terms:\n\n- a(k x + y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nDivide by 'a':\n\n- (k x + y) + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n- k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nSimilarly, for distance to C:\n\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²]\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²\n\nExpanding:\n\nx² - ka x + (ka/2)² + y² + a y + (a/2)²\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < -ka x + (ka/2)² + a y + (a/2)²\n\nSimplify:\n\n-ka x + a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0\n\nFactor:\n\n- a(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nDivide by 'a':\n\n- (k x - y) + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n- k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nAnd finally, for distance to D:\n\n√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²]\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²\n\nExpanding:\n\nx² + ka x + (ka/2)² + y² + a y + (a/2)²\n\nSubtract x² + y²:\n\n0 < ka x + (ka/2)² + a y + (a/2)²\n\nSimplify:\n\nka x + a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0\n\nFactor:\n\na(k x + y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nDivide by 'a':\n\nk x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nSo, now I have four inequalities:\n\n1. k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n2. -k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n3. -k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n4. k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0\n\nThese four inequalities define the region where a point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, the intersection of these four regions will give me the desired area.\n\nLet me try to visualize these inequalities. Each inequality represents a half-plane. The intersection of all four will form a polygon, likely a quadrilateral or another shape, within the rectangle.\n\nLet me rewrite the inequalities for clarity:\n\n1. y < k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)\n2. y < -k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)\n3. y > k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)\n4. y > -k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. When I rearrange the inequalities:\n\n1. From the first inequality: k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y < k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)\n2. From the second inequality: -k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y < -k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)\n3. From the third inequality: -k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y > k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)\n4. From the fourth inequality: k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y > -k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the region is bounded by four lines:\n\n- y = k x + c\n- y = -k x + c\n- y = k x - c\n- y = -k x - c\n\nWhere c = (a (k² + 1)/4)\n\nSo, these four lines form a diamond (a rotated square) centered at the origin. The intersection of these four lines will create a diamond shape inside the rectangle.\n\nTo find the area where all four inequalities are satisfied, I need to find the region bounded by these four lines. The intersection points of these lines will give the vertices of this diamond.\n\nLet me find the intersection points.\n\nFirst, find where y = k x + c intersects y = -k x + c.\n\nSet k x + c = -k x + c => 2k x = 0 => x = 0. Then y = c. So, one point is (0, c).\n\nSimilarly, find where y = -k x + c intersects y = -k x - c.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me pair them correctly.\n\nWait, actually, each pair of lines will intersect at a point. Let me list all possible intersections:\n\n1. Intersection of y = k x + c and y = -k x + c: as above, (0, c)\n2. Intersection of y = -k x + c and y = -k x - c: Wait, these are parallel lines? No, wait, no, they have the same slope but different intercepts, so they don't intersect.\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, y = -k x + c and y = -k x - c are parallel, so they don't intersect. Similarly, y = k x + c and y = k x - c are parallel.\n\nWait, so actually, the four lines form two pairs of parallel lines, each pair with slopes k and -k. So, the four lines form a parallelogram, not a diamond. Hmm, but since the slopes are negative reciprocals? Wait, no, the slopes are k and -k, which are not negative reciprocals unless k=1.\n\nWait, actually, for a diamond shape, the lines should have slopes that are negative reciprocals, but in this case, they are just k and -k, so unless k=1, it's not a diamond but a parallelogram.\n\nWait, but in our case, the four lines are:\n\n1. y = k x + c\n2. y = -k x + c\n3. y = k x - c\n4. y = -k x - c\n\nSo, these four lines form a parallelogram. Let me find the four intersection points.\n\nIntersection of y = k x + c and y = -k x + c: as before, (0, c)\n\nIntersection of y = -k x + c and y = k x - c:\n\nSet -k x + c = k x - c => -2k x = -2c => x = c/k\n\nThen y = -k*(c/k) + c = -c + c = 0. So, point is (c/k, 0)\n\nSimilarly, intersection of y = k x - c and y = -k x - c:\n\nSet k x - c = -k x - c => 2k x = 0 => x=0, y = -c. So, point is (0, -c)\n\nIntersection of y = -k x - c and y = k x + c:\n\nSet -k x - c = k x + c => -2k x = 2c => x = -c/k\n\nThen y = -k*(-c/k) - c = c - c = 0. So, point is (-c/k, 0)\n\nSo, the four vertices of the parallelogram are:\n\n(0, c), (c/k, 0), (0, -c), (-c/k, 0)\n\nSo, this is a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the origin, with vertices along the y-axis at (0, c) and (0, -c), and along the x-axis at (c/k, 0) and (-c/k, 0).\n\nWait, but in our rectangle, the x-axis goes from -ka/2 to ka/2, and the y-axis from -a/2 to a/2.\n\nSo, the diamond is inscribed within the rectangle.

Let me make sure I understand it correctly. The function f(n) is equal to the floor of n if n is greater than or equal to 4, and it's equal to the ceiling of n if n is less than 4. So, depending on whether the input is 4 or more or less than 4, it either takes the floor or the ceiling of that number.\n\nAlright, the problem is asking me to compute f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)). So, I need to evaluate each of these three terms separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me start with the first term: f(π/3). Since π is approximately 3.1416, dividing that by 3 gives me roughly 1.0472. So, π/3 is approximately 1.0472. Now, since 1.0472 is less than 4, according to the function definition, I need to take the ceiling of this value. The ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. So, the ceiling of 1.0472 is 2. Therefore, f(π/3) is 2.\n\nNext, the second term is f(√45). Let me calculate √45. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so √45 is somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a more precise value, I can note that 45 is 9*5, so √45 is 3√5. Since √5 is approximately 2.236, multiplying that by 3 gives me about 6.708. So, √45 is approximately 6.708. Now, since 6.708 is greater than or equal to 4, I need to take the floor of this value. The floor function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. So, the floor of 6.708 is 6. Therefore, f(√45) is 6.\n\nMoving on to the third term: f(8^(2/3)). Let me compute 8^(2/3). I know that 8 is 2^3, so 8^(1/3) is 2. Then, raising that result to the power of 2 gives me 2^2, which is 4. So, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4. Now, since 4 is equal to 4, according to the function definition, I need to take the floor of this value. The floor of 4 is just 4. Therefore, f(8^(2/3)) is 4.\n\nNow, adding all three results together: f(π/3) is 2, f(√45) is 6, and f(8^(2/3)) is 4. So, 2 + 6 + 4 equals 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For f(π/3), π is about 3.1416, so divided by 3 is approximately 1.0472. Since that's less than 4, ceiling of 1.0472 is indeed 2. Correct.\n\nFor f(√45), √45 is approximately 6.708, which is more than 4, so floor of that is 6. That seems right.\n\nFor f(8^(2/3)), 8^(1/3) is 2, squared is 4. Since 4 is equal to 4, floor of 4 is 4. That's correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 6 is 8, plus 4 is 12. So, the total is 12.\n\nI think that's all correct.

A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same. The grid given is a 3x3 magic square, and some of the cells are filled with expressions involving 'n'. My job is to figure out what 'n' is.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like the grid is labeled with some expressions and numbers. Let me write down the grid as per the labels:\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the labels are placed at specific coordinates. Each label is placed at the center of each cell, so the first row (from top to bottom) would be:\n\n- First cell: n - 3\n- Second cell: 3\n- Third cell: n + 1\n\nWait, no, hold on. The Asymptote code labels are placed at (0.5, 0.5), which is the center of the first cell, (0.5, 1.5) is the center of the second cell in the first column, and so on. So actually, the grid is structured as follows:\n\nFirst row (top row):\n- First cell: n - 3\n- Second cell: 3\n- Third cell: n + 1\n\nSecond row:\n- First cell: n + 2\n- Second cell: 2n - 9\n- Third cell: 1\n\nThird row:\n- First cell: 2\n- Second cell: n\n- Third cell: n - 1\n\nWait, let me make sure. The Asymptote code labels are placed at (x, y) where x and y are the coordinates. The first label is at (0.5, 0.5), which is the center of the first cell in the first row, first column. Then (0.5, 1.5) is the center of the first column, second row. Similarly, (0.5, 2.5) is the first column, third row. So actually, the grid is:\n\nFirst column:\n- Top: n - 3\n- Middle: n + 2\n- Bottom: 2\n\nSecond column:\n- Top: 3\n- Middle: 2n - 9\n- Bottom: n\n\nThird column:\n- Top: n + 1\n- Middle: 1\n- Bottom: n - 1\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 1: [n - 3, 3, n + 1]\n\nRow 2: [n + 2, 2n - 9, 1]\n\nRow 3: [2, n, n - 1]\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So now, I can write the grid as:\n\n| n-3 | 3 | n+1 |\n|-----|---|-----|\n| n+2 |2n-9| 1 |\n| 2 | n | n-1 |\n\nNow, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals must add up to the same number, which is called the magic constant.\n\nLet me denote the magic constant as S. So, each row, column, and diagonal sums to S.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations based on the rows.\n\nRow 1: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S\n\nSimplify that: n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S\n\nRow 2: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S\n\nSimplify: n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S\n\nRow 3: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S\n\nSimplify: 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 = S\n\nWait, so from Row 1 and Row 3, both give S = 2n + 1. From Row 2, S = 3n - 6.\n\nSo, since both expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\nSolving for n:\n\n2n + 1 = 3n - 6\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides:\n\n1 = n - 6\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\nn = 7\n\nHmm, so n is 7? Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet me substitute n = 7 into the grid:\n\nRow 1: 7 - 3 = 4, 3, 7 + 1 = 8. So Row 1: 4, 3, 8. Sum: 4 + 3 + 8 = 15.\n\nRow 2: 7 + 2 = 9, 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, 1. So Row 2: 9, 5, 1. Sum: 9 + 5 + 1 = 15.\n\nRow 3: 2, 7, 7 - 1 = 6. So Row 3: 2, 7, 6. Sum: 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.\n\nOkay, so all rows sum to 15. Good.\n\nNow, let's check the columns.\n\nColumn 1: 4, 9, 2. Sum: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15.\n\nColumn 2: 3, 5, 7. Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.\n\nColumn 3: 8, 1, 6. Sum: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.\n\nPerfect, all columns also sum to 15.\n\nNow, the diagonals.\n\nMain diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): 4, 5, 6. Sum: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.\n\nOther diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): 8, 5, 2. Sum: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15.\n\nEverything checks out. So n = 7 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial equations.\n\nFrom Row 1: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1.\n\nYes, because n - 3 + 3 cancels out to n, and then + n +1 is 2n +1.\n\nRow 2: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n -9 +1 = 3n -6.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nRow 3: 2 + n + (n -1) = 2 + n + n -1 = 2n +1.\n\nSo, 2n +1 = 3n -6, leading to n=7.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me plug n=7 into all cells:\n\nRow 1: 4, 3, 8\n\nRow 2: 9, 5, 1\n\nRow 3: 2, 7, 6\n\nThis is actually a well-known magic square, the Lo Shu square, which is the 3x3 magic square with magic constant 15. So, that's a good sign.\n\nTherefore, n is 7.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\( n \\) is determined by ensuring all rows, columns, and diagonals of the magic square sum to the same constant. By setting up equations from the rows and solving, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\n\\boxed{7}", "answer": "7"}

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equation \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) has three roots, which are the cube roots of unity. These roots are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\). But since \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number, it can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined or something? Wait, no, actually, if \\(\\omega = 1\\), then \\(1 + \\omega = 2\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2 = 2\\), so the expression would be \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). But maybe the problem is considering the non-real cube roots? I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nSo, the cube roots of unity are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are complex numbers. Since the problem says \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number, it's probably referring to the non-real roots. So, \\(\\omega\\) is either \\(\\omega\\) or \\(\\omega^2\\). But wait, \\(\\omega^2\\) is also a complex number, so maybe both are acceptable. So, I need to compute the expression for both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) and see if they give the same value or different ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is the same regardless of whether \\(\\omega\\) is \\(\\omega\\) or \\(\\omega^2\\). Let me try to compute it.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for cube roots of unity, we have the property that \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\). That might be useful here. Also, \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^3 - 1 = 0\\), which factors as \\((\\omega - 1)(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1) = 0\\). So, \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\) for the non-real roots.\n\nOkay, so maybe I can use that identity to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI can try to combine these two fractions by finding a common denominator. The common denominator would be \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). So, let's compute the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nBut from the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we know that \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). So, substituting that into the numerator:\n\n\\[\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator is 1. Now, let's compute the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\n\\]\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n- \\(1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2\\)\n- \\(\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega\\)\n- \\(\\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^3\\)\n\nBut \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so that term is 1. So, putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = (1 + 1) + (\\omega + \\omega^2) = 2 + (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the denominator is also 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nWait, so the expression equals 1? But earlier, I thought if \\(\\omega = 1\\), the expression would be 1 as well. But if \\(\\omega = 1\\), then \\(1 + \\omega = 2\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2 = 2\\), so the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). So, whether \\(\\omega\\) is 1 or a non-real cube root, the expression is 1. But wait, if \\(\\omega = 1\\), then \\(\\omega^2 = 1\\) as well, so both denominators are 2, and the sum is 1. If \\(\\omega\\) is a non-real cube root, then the expression is also 1. So, in all cases, the expression equals 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"복소수 \\(\\omega\\)\" which is a complex number, so maybe it's considering all cube roots, including 1. But in that case, the expression is always 1. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the expression for \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3}\\), which is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nSo, \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} = \\cos(2\\pi/3) + i \\sin(2\\pi/3) = -1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2\\). Then, \\(\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i /3} = \\cos(4\\pi/3) + i \\sin(4\\pi/3) = -1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2\\).\n\nCompute \\(1 + \\omega = 1 + (-1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2\\). Similarly, \\(1 + \\omega^2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2\\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2} + \\frac{1}{1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each term separately. The first term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1}{e^{i\\pi/3}} = e^{-i\\pi/3} = \\cos(-\\pi/3) + i \\sin(-\\pi/3) = 1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1}{e^{-i\\pi/3}} = e^{i\\pi/3} = \\cos(\\pi/3) + i \\sin(\\pi/3) = 1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2\n\\]\n\nAdding these two together:\n\n\\[\n(1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2) + (1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i \\sqrt{3}/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, yes, it does equal 1. Therefore, regardless of whether \\(\\omega\\) is 1 or a non-real cube root, the expression equals 1. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but if \\(\\omega = 1\\), then \\(\\omega^2 = 1\\) as well, so both denominators are 2, and the sum is 1. If \\(\\omega\\) is a non-real cube root, the sum is also 1. So, in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 regardless of whether \\(\\omega\\) is 1 or a non-real cube root of unity. Therefore, the only possible value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]", "answer": "1"}

I need to find the shortest possible distance when starting from any one of these points and visiting the other three exactly once. Hmm, that sounds like a traveling salesman problem but with four points. I remember that the traveling salesman problem is about finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, but in this case, I don't need to return to the starting point, just visit all four points once. So, it's a bit different.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the distances between each pair of points. The Asymptote code gives me some distances, so I can use those. Let me list them out:\n\n- D to B is 3 units.\n- A to B is 6 units.\n- A to C is 6 units.\n- D to C is 4 units.\n- A to D is 5 units.\n- C to B is 5 units.\n\nWait, so let me make sure I have all the distances correctly. From the Asymptote code, the labels are:\n\n- \"3\" between D and B,\n- \"6\" between A and B,\n- \"6\" between A and C,\n- \"4\" between D and C,\n- \"5\" between A and D,\n- \"5\" between C and B.\n\nSo, I can represent this as a graph where each node is a point, and the edges have the given weights. Let me write down all the distances:\n\n- AB = 6\n- AC = 6\n- AD = 5\n- BC = 5\n- BD = 3\n- CD = 4\n\nSo, now I need to find the shortest path that starts at one point and visits the other three exactly once. Since it's four points, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24, but since we can start at any point, maybe it's a bit less? Wait, no, actually, for each starting point, there are 3! = 6 permutations of the remaining points. So, 4 starting points × 6 permutations each = 24 total paths. But that's a lot to check manually. Maybe I can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is small, maybe I can list all possible paths and calculate their total distances, then pick the smallest one. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible starting points and their permutations.\n\nStarting at A:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D\n2. A -> B -> D -> C\n3. A -> C -> B -> D\n4. A -> C -> D -> B\n5.

C -> A -> B -> D\n    - C to A: 6\n    - A to B: 6\n    - B to D: 3\n    Total: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\n\n14.

D -> B -> A -> C\n    - D to B: 3\n    - B to A: 6\n    - A to C: 6\n    Total: 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\n\n22.

But wait, let me double-check if I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLooking back at the paths that gave 13:\n\nFrom A: paths 2 (A-B-D-C), 4 (A-C-D-B), 5 (A-D-B-C)\nFrom B: path 12 (B-D-C-A)\nFrom C: paths 16 (C-B-D-A), 18 (C-D-B-A)\nFrom D: none, the shortest was 14.\n\nSo, all these paths have a total distance of 13. Therefore, the minimal distance is 13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any possible shorter path. For example, is there a way to have a path that goes through D multiple times? No, because we have to visit each point exactly once. So, each point is visited once, so the path is a permutation of the four points, starting at one and visiting the others in some order.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total distance is 13.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 13.\n</think>\n\nThe shortest distance is achieved by several paths, each totaling 13 units. Therefore, the minimal distance is \\boxed{13}.", "answer": "13"}
