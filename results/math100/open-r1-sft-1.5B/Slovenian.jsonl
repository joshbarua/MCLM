I need to find the length of DE in this right triangle. The triangle is labeled D, E, F, with a right angle at F. The coordinates given are D at (sqrt(51), 7) and E at (0,7). The length of EF is 7 units, as indicated by the label. So, DE is the hypotenuse of the right triangle DEF. Hmm, but how do I find DE?\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Point D is at (sqrt(51), 7), which is in the first quadrant, and point E is at (0,7), which is on the y-axis. The right angle is at F, which is at (0,0). So, the triangle DEF has vertices at D(sqrt(51),7), E(0,7), and F(0,0). The side DE is the hypotenuse, and we need to find its length.\n\nSince we know the coordinates of D and E, maybe I can use the distance formula to find DE. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Let's apply that here.\n\nCoordinates of D: (sqrt(51), 7)\nCoordinates of E: (0,7)\n\nSo, the difference in x-coordinates is 0 - sqrt(51) = -sqrt(51)\nThe difference in y-coordinates is 7 - 7 = 0\n\nTherefore, the distance DE is sqrt[(-sqrt(51))^2 + (0)^2] = sqrt[51 + 0] = sqrt(51). Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that sin D = 0.7. Let me verify if that's consistent with the coordinates given. Wait, sin D would be the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. So, the opposite side to angle D would be EF, which is 7 units, and the hypotenuse would be DE. So, sin D = EF / DE = 7 / DE. The problem states that sin D = 0.7, so 7 / DE = 0.7. Solving for DE, we get DE = 7 / 0.7 = 10. So, DE is 10 units. But according to the distance formula, DE is sqrt(51) ≈ 7.141. But that contradicts the sin D value. So, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the sine function. Let's think again. In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. So, the sides adjacent and opposite to angle D would be... Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the triangle. Let's label the triangle properly.\n\nPoint D is at (sqrt(51),7), E is at (0,7), and F is at (0,0). So, triangle DEF has vertices at D(sqrt(51),7), E(0,7), and F(0,0). So, angle at D is angle EDF. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that sin D = 0.7. Wait, maybe angle D is at point D, so angle EDF. Then, the opposite side to angle D would be EF, which is 7 units, and the hypotenuse would be DE. So, sin D = EF / DE = 7 / DE = 0.7. Therefore, DE = 7 / 0.7 = 10. So, DE is 10 units. But according to the distance formula, DE is sqrt(51) ≈ 7.141. So, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, either the coordinates are wrong, or the problem statement is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"de\" is the length of DE. If DE is 10, then that's the answer. But according to the coordinates, DE is sqrt(51). So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not a right triangle? Wait, the triangle is labeled DEF, with right angle at F. So, DEF is a right triangle with right angle at F. So, sides are DF, EF, and DE. So, DF is from D(sqrt(51),7) to F(0,0), which is sqrt[(sqrt(51)-0)^2 + (7-0)^2] = sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. Then, EF is 7, and DE is sqrt(51). So, DE is sqrt(51). But according to the sine of angle D, which is at D, the opposite side is EF (7) and hypotenuse is DE (sqrt(51)). So, sin D = 7 / sqrt(51) ≈ 7 / 7.141 ≈ 0.98. But the problem states sin D = 0.7. So, that's inconsistent. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the triangle is not DEF? Wait, the problem says \"de\" is the length of DE. So, DE is the hypotenuse of the right triangle DEF. So, if DEF is a right triangle with right angle at F, then DE is the hypotenuse. So, DE = sqrt(DF^2 + EF^2). DF is from D(sqrt(51),7) to F(0,0), which is sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. EF is 7. So, DE = sqrt(100 + 49) = sqrt(149). Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no. Wait, DF is from D(sqrt(51),7) to F(0,0), which is sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. Then, EF is 7. So, DE is sqrt(10^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(100 + 49) = sqrt(149). But that's not 10. So, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If the triangle is DEF with right angle at F, then DE is the hypotenuse. So, DE = sqrt(DF^2 + EF^2). DF is from D(sqrt(51),7) to F(0,0), which is sqrt(51 + 49) = sqrt(100) = 10. EF is 7. So, DE = sqrt(10^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(100 + 49) = sqrt(149). But according to the problem statement, sin D = 0.7. Let's compute sin D. In triangle DEF, angle D is at D. The opposite side to angle D is EF (7), and the hypotenuse is DE (sqrt(149)). So, sin D = EF / DE = 7 / sqrt(149). Let's compute that: 7 / sqrt(149) ≈ 7 / 12.206 ≈ 0.573. But the problem states sin D = 0.7. So, that's not matching. Therefore, there's a contradiction here.

I need to find the complex number \\( w \\) such that when I rotate \\( z \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians (which is 45 degrees) around the point \\( c \\), the result is \\( w \\). The given points are \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\). \n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves two steps: translating the point to the origin, rotating it, and then translating it back. Let me recall the formula for rotation in the complex plane. If I want to rotate a point \\( z \\) around a point \\( c \\) by an angle \\( \\theta \\), the formula is:\n\n\\[ w = c + (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\theta} \\]\n\nYes, that seems right. So, substituting the given values into this formula should give me the desired result. Let me verify that. \n\nGiven \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\), and \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\). \n\nFirst, compute \\( z - c \\):\n\n\\( z - c = [2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i] - [2 - 3i] \\)\n\nSubtracting the real parts: \\( 2 - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nSubtracting the imaginary parts: \\( - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) = -3i - 3\\sqrt{2}i + 3i = (-3\\sqrt{2}i) \\)\n\nSo, \\( z - c = -3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\nThen, multiply this by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\). Since \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( e^{i\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore, multiplying \\( z - c \\) by this:\n\n\\( (-3\\sqrt{2}i) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nLet me compute this step by step.

Let me check with another method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the rotation using the rotation matrix.

I remember that square roots can sometimes be simplified if the number is a perfect square or if it has factors that are perfect squares. Let me start by factoring 242.\n\nFirst, let's see if 242 is even. 242 divided by 2 is 121. So, 242 = 2 × 121. Now, 121 is a perfect square because 11 × 11 = 121. So, 242 = 2 × 11². Therefore, the square root of 242 would be the square root of (2 × 11²). \n\nI know that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots. So, √(2 × 11²) = √2 × √(11²). The square root of 11 squared is 11, so that simplifies to 11√2. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If 242 is 2 times 11 squared, then the square root would be √2 times √11², which is √2 times 11. So, 11√2. That seems right. Let me verify by squaring 11√2. 11 squared is 121, and (√2) squared is 2. So, 121 × 2 = 242. Yep, that checks out. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by prime factorization? Let me try that. The prime factors of 242. Starting with 242 divided by 2 is 121. Then 121 is 11 squared. So, 242 = 2 × 11². So, same as before. Therefore, the square root is 11√2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calculator to check, but since this is a math problem, I think the answer is 11√2. Let me just confirm once more. If I take 11 times √2, that's approximately 11 times 1.4142, which is about 15.5562. Then, squaring that should give 242. Let's see: 15.5562 squared. Let's compute 15.5562 * 15.5562. \n\nFirst, 15 * 15 = 225. Then, 15 * 0.5562 = 8.343, and 0.5562 * 15 = 8.343, and 0.5562 * 0.5562 ≈ 0.309. So, adding those up: 225 + 8.343 + 8.343 + 0.309 ≈ 225 + 16.686 + 0.309 ≈ 242. So, that checks out. \n\nTherefore, the square root of 242 is indeed 11 times the square root of 2. So, the final answer is 11√2. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe square root of 242 is \\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the square root of 242, we start by factoring it into its prime factors:\n\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\times 121\n\\]\n\nWe recognize that 121 is a perfect square, specifically \\(11^2\\). Therefore, we can rewrite 242 as:\n\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\times 11^2\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we use the property that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 11^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{11^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{11^2} = 11\\), we simplify this to:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{242} = 11 \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we square \\(11 \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n(11 \\sqrt{2})^2 = 11^2 \\times (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 121 \\times 2 = 242\n\\]\n\nThus, the square root of 242 is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]", "answer": "11\\sqrt2"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when expanding a binomial like this, the general term in the expansion is given by the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n\\) expands to the sum of terms where each term is \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\), right? So in this case, \\(a\\) is \\(10x^3\\), \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n\\) is 5. \n\nSo, the general term \\(T_k\\) would be \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\). Let me write that out more clearly. \n\nFirst, the binomial coefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{k}\\). Then, the first part is \\((10x^3)^{5-k}\\), which is \\(10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)}\\). The second part is \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\), which is \\((-1)^k \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k x^{-2k}\\). \n\nSo combining these, the general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{k} \\cdot 10^{5-k} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\cdot x^{3(5-k) - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent of \\(x\\):\n\n\\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\\)\n\nSo the exponent of \\(x\\) in the general term is \\(15 - 5k\\). \n\nNow, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero. So we set \\(15 - 5k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(15 - 5k = 0\\)\n\n\\(5k = 15\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\). Let's plug \\(k = 3\\) into the general term formula.\n\nFirst, the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). Since \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 1} = 10\\).\n\nThen, \\(10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} \\cdot 10^{5-3} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = 10 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\)\n\n\\(1000 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{1000}{8} = -125\\)\n\nSo the constant term is \\(-125\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let's verify the exponent again. \n\nOriginal exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(15 - 5k\\). For \\(k = 3\\), that's \\(15 - 15 = 0\\). Yes, that's correct. So the exponent is indeed zero. \n\nThen, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times 10^{2} \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\). \n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\)\n\n\\(10^2 = 100\\)\n\n\\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(10 \\times 100 \\times -\\frac{1}{8} = -125\\). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the constant term is \\(-125\\). \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the concept of exponents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the constant term in a binomial expansion. The general term is as I had before. The exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(15 - 5k\\). To have the exponent zero, set \\(15 - 5k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times 10^{2} \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\). \n\nYes, that's the same as before. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the multinomial theorem? But since it's a binomial, the multinomial theorem reduces to the binomial theorem. So that's not necessary here. \n\nAnother way to think about it: the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(x\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion, we need the exponents of \\(x\\) from both terms to add up to zero. \n\nSo, the first term is \\(10x^3\\), so each time we take \\(10x^3\\), we get a factor of \\(x^3\\). The second term is \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), so each time we take \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), we get a factor of \\(x^{-2}\\). \n\nSo, if we take \\(m\\) terms of \\(10x^3\\) and \\(n\\) terms of \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), then the total exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(3m - 2n\\). We need this to be zero. So, \\(3m - 2n = 0\\). \n\nAlso, since we are choosing from 5 terms, \\(m + n = 5\\). \n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(3m - 2n = 0\\)\n2. \\(m + n = 5\\)\n\nSolving these equations. From the second equation, \\(n = 5 - m\\). Substitute into the first equation:\n\n\\(3m - 2(5 - m) = 0\\)\n\n\\(3m - 10 + 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(5m - 10 = 0\\)\n\n\\(5m = 10\\)\n\n\\(m = 2\\)\n\nThen, \\(n = 5 - 2 = 3\\). So, we need to take 2 terms of \\(10x^3\\) and 3 terms of \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\). \n\nThen, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{5}{2} \\times 10^2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\). \n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\)\n\n\\(10^2 = 100\\)\n\n\\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(10 \\times 100 \\times -\\frac{1}{8} = -125\\). \n\nSame result. So that's another way to confirm. \n\nTherefore, the constant term is indeed \\(-125\\). \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key steps were setting the exponent of \\(x\\) to zero, solving for \\(k\\), and then computing the corresponding coefficient. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe constant term is \\boxed{-125}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\), we use the binomial theorem.

Maybe substituting \\(n = 7k + 2\\) into the expression \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) would help. Let me try that.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. \\(n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4\\)\n2. \\(n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6\\)\n3. \\(n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8\\)\n\nSo the product becomes \\((7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\\). Now, when we divide this product by 7, we need to find the remainder. \n\nBut wait, each term in the product is a multiple of 7 plus some constant. Let me see:\n\n- \\(7k + 4\\) is 4 more than a multiple of 7.\n- \\(7k + 6\\) is 6 more than a multiple of 7.\n- \\(7k + 8\\) is 8 more than a multiple of 7, which is equivalent to 1 more than a multiple of 7 (since 8 mod 7 is 1).\n\nSo, each term is congruent to 4, 6, and 1 modulo 7, respectively.

Then, 24 modulo 7. Let's divide 24 by 7: 7*3=21, so 24-21=3. Therefore, 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. \n\nSo the remainder is 3. Wait, but let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding the product and then taking modulo 7. Let's try that. \n\nFirst, expand \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\). Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply the first two terms: \\((n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8\\).\n\nThen multiply this result by the third term: \\((n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6)\\).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst, multiply \\(n^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial: \\(n^2 \\times n = n^3\\), \\(n^2 \\times 6 = 6n^2\\).\n\nThen multiply \\(6n\\) by each term: \\(6n \\times n = 6n^2\\), \\(6n \\times 6 = 36n\\).\n\nThen multiply 8 by each term: \\(8 \\times n = 8n\\), \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\).\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\n\\(n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48\\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(n^3\\)\n- \\(6n^2 + 6n^2 = 12n^2\\)\n- \\(36n + 8n = 44n\\)\n- 48\n\nSo the expanded polynomial is \\(n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48\\).\n\nNow, substitute \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\). So replace \\(n\\) with 2 in the polynomial:\n\n\\(2^3 + 12 \\times 2^2 + 44 \\times 2 + 48\\).\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- \\(12 \\times 2^2 = 12 \\times 4 = 48\\)\n- \\(44 \\times 2 = 88\\)\n- 48 remains 48\n\nAdd them up: 8 + 48 + 88 + 48.\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n8 + 48 = 56\n\n56 + 88 = 144\n\n144 + 48 = 192\n\nSo the total is 192. Now, find 192 modulo 7.\n\nDivide 192 by 7: 7*27=189, 192-189=3. So 192 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 3. \n\nSo both methods give the same result. That's reassuring. So the answer is 3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, substitute \\( n = 7k + 2 \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\n\\]\n\nEach term in the product is congruent to:\n- \\( 7k + 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( 7k + 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( 7k + 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThus, the product is congruent to:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 24 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 24 \\mod 7 \\):\n\\[\n24 \\div 7 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\implies 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, expand the polynomial and substitute \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[\n(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[\n2^3 + 12 \\times 2^2 + 44 \\times 2 + 48 = 8 + 48 + 88 + 48 = 192\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 192 \\mod 7 \\):\n\\[\n192 \\div 7 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\implies 192 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).", "answer": "3"}

The problem is about a pentagon (which is a five-sided polygon) that's inscribed in a circle. The pentagon is oriented such that each side is tangent to a circle with radius 1, and the center of this circle is the same as the center of the pentagon. The question is asking for the smallest number of degrees we need to rotate the pentagon so that it's back to its original position. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. A regular pentagon inscribed in a circle would have all its vertices touching the circle. But here, the pentagon is not regular because each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1. Wait, but the problem says \"inscribed in a circle,\" which usually means all vertices lie on the circle. But if each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1, that suggests that the pentagon is not regular. So, the pentagon is irregular, with each side tangent to a circle of radius 1, and the center of the circle is the same as the center of the pentagon. \n\nSo, the pentagon is symmetric with respect to the center, but not regular. The key here is that the pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, but each side is tangent to another circle of radius 1. Wait, but if the pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, then all its vertices lie on that circle. But if each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1, that would mean that the distance from the center of the circle to each side is 1. \n\nWait, but the distance from the center to a side of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is equal to the apothem. The apothem of a regular pentagon with circumradius 1 is given by (1/2) * cot(π/5). Let me compute that. \n\nCot(π/5) is equal to cot(36°), which is approximately 1.37638. So, the apothem would be (1/2)*1.37638 ≈ 0.68819. But the problem states that each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1. That would mean that the distance from the center to each side is 1. But in a regular pentagon, the apothem is approximately 0.688, which is less than 1. Therefore, such a pentagon cannot be regular. \n\nTherefore, the pentagon is irregular, with each side tangent to a circle of radius 1, and the center of the circle is the same as the center of the pentagon. So, the pentagon is symmetric with respect to the center, but not regular. \n\nNow, the question is about rotating the pentagon so that it's back to its original position. The minimal number of degrees required for this rotation. \n\nSince the pentagon is symmetric, the rotation angle must be a divisor of 360 degrees. The minimal rotation angle would be the smallest angle that maps the pentagon onto itself. For a regular pentagon, the minimal rotation angle is 72 degrees (360/5). But since this pentagon is irregular, the rotation angle might be different. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"semevnoj srednjice\" which translates to \"the same as the first one.\" So, the pentagon is rotated so that it's back to its original position. The minimal number of degrees required for this rotation. \n\nBut how do we determine the minimal rotation angle for an irregular pentagon? For a regular pentagon, the rotation angle is 72 degrees, but for an irregular one, it could be different. However, since the problem mentions that the pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, and each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1, maybe there's a specific angle that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pentagon is such that rotating it by 72 degrees brings it back to the original position. But since it's irregular, maybe the minimal rotation angle is a divisor of 360 degrees. \n\nWait, but the problem is in Russian, and the original might have a specific answer. Let me think again. \n\nIf the pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, and each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1, then the distance from the center to each side is 1. But in a regular pentagon, the apothem is less than 1. Therefore, such a pentagon cannot be regular. \n\nBut the problem states that the pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, so all its vertices lie on that circle. Therefore, the distance from the center to each vertex is 1. But each side is tangent to a circle of radius 1. So, the distance from the center to each side is 1. \n\nWait, but in a regular pentagon, the distance from the center to each side is the apothem, which is (1/2) * cot(π/5) ≈ 0.688. But here, the distance is 1. Therefore, such a pentagon cannot be regular. \n\nTherefore, the pentagon is irregular, with each side tangent to a circle of radius 1, and the center of the circle is the same as the center of the pentagon. \n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal rotation angle that maps the pentagon back to its original position. \n\nSince the pentagon is symmetric with respect to the center, the rotation angle must be a divisor of 360 degrees.

I need to find the coordinates of a parallelogram with three given points: (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4). The problem says that the coordinate x is greater than 7, and I need to find the value of x + y for the fourth point. Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, if I can figure out the fourth point based on the given three, I can then compute x + y. Let me start by recalling the properties of parallelograms. \n\nI think one method to find the fourth point is to use vector addition. If I consider two adjacent sides of the parallelogram, their vectors should be equal. Let me try to visualize the points. The given points are (5,3), (6,8), and (7,4). Let's denote them as A(5,3), B(6,8), and C(7,4). \n\nWait, but in a parallelogram, the order of the points matters. If the points are A, B, C, then the fourth point D should be such that vector AB is equal to vector CD. Alternatively, vector AC should be equal to vector BD. Hmm, maybe I need to check both possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, since it's a parallelogram, the midpoint of the diagonals should be the same. So, if I can find the midpoint of one diagonal, that should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, let's list the three points: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4). Let's assume that the fourth point is D(x,y). Then, the midpoints of diagonals AC and BD should be the same. \n\nMidpoint of AC: ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6, 3.5). \n\nMidpoint of BD: ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). \n\nSetting these equal: \n\n(6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6. \n\n(8 + y)/2 = 3.5 => 8 + y = 7 => y = -1. \n\nSo, the fourth point D would be (6, -1). But wait, the problem states that x > 7. But here, x is 6, which is not greater than 7. That's a problem. \n\nHmm, so maybe my assumption about the order of the points is wrong? Maybe the given points are not in the order of the parallelogram. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the points are not in order. For example, if the points are A, B, C, D, then the sides AB, BC, CD, DA should be equal and parallel. But since we only have three points, maybe the fourth point is determined by the given three. \n\nWait, perhaps the three points are not consecutive. Let me think. If the three points are A, B, C, then the fourth point D can be found by vector addition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are not in order. For example, if the points are A, C, B, then the fourth point D would be such that vector AC is equal to vector BD. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nIf the points are A(5,3), C(7,4), B(6,8), then the fourth point D should be such that vector AC = vector BD. \n\nVector AC: (7-5, 4-3) = (2,1). \n\nVector BD: (6 - x, 8 - y). \n\nSetting equal: (6 - x, 8 - y) = (2,1). \n\nSo, 6 - x = 2 => x = 4. \n\n8 - y = 1 => y = 7. \n\nSo, the fourth point D would be (4,7). But again, x = 4, which is not greater than 7. \n\nHmm, so this approach also gives x = 4. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the three given points are not in order. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"Koordinates paralelogramu so (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) v (x, y), pri 7 > x.\" \n\nSo, the three given points are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4). The fourth point is (x,y), and x > 7. \n\nSo, perhaps the three points are not consecutive. For example, the points could be A, C, B, D, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D, but in a different order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D, but the order is different. For example, if the points are A, C, D, B, but that might not form a parallelogram. \n\nWait, perhaps the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D, but the order is A, B, C, D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. \n\nBut in that case, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should be equal and parallel. \n\nSo, vector AB: (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). \n\nVector BC: (7-6, 4-8) = (1,-4). \n\nVector CD: (x-7, y-4). \n\nVector DA: (5 - x, 3 - y). \n\nFor it to be a parallelogram, vector AB should equal vector CD, and vector BC should equal vector DA. \n\nSo, AB = CD => (1,5) = (x-7, y-4). \n\nTherefore, x -7 = 1 => x = 8. \n\ny -4 =5 => y =9. \n\nSo, the fourth point D would be (8,9). \n\nThen, x =8, which is greater than 7. \n\nBut wait, let's check if this works. \n\nIf the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9), then the sides AB, BC, CD, DA should be equal and parallel. \n\nAB: from (5,3) to (6,8): vector (1,5). \n\nBC: from (6,8) to (7,4): vector (1,-4). \n\nCD: from (7,4) to (8,9): vector (1,5). \n\nDA: from (8,9) to (5,3): vector (-3,-6). \n\nWait, vector DA is (-3,-6), which is not equal to vector AB or BC. So, this is not a parallelogram. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So, my assumption here is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the three points are A(5,3), B(6,8), and C(7,4). Let's consider the vectors AB and AC. \n\nVector AB: (6-5,8-3)=(1,5). \n\nVector AC: (7-5,4-3)=(2,1). \n\nIf we want to form a parallelogram, the fourth point D should be such that vector AD is equal to vector BC. \n\nVector BC: (7-6,4-8)=(1,-4). \n\nSo, vector AD should be (1,-4). \n\nTherefore, starting from point A(5,3), moving in the direction of vector AD: (5 +1, 3 -4)=(6,-1). \n\nSo, the fourth point D would be (6,-1). \n\nBut again, x=6, which is not greater than 7. \n\nHmm, so this approach also gives x=6. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the three given points are not in the order of the parallelogram. For example, if the points are A, B, C, D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are A, C, B, D, but that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D, but the order is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. \n\nBut in that case, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should be equal and parallel. \n\nSo, vector AB = (1,5), vector BC = (1,-4), vector CD = (x-7, y-4), vector DA = (5 -x, 3 - y). \n\nFor it to be a parallelogram, vector AB should equal vector CD, and vector BC should equal vector DA. \n\nSo, AB = CD => (1,5) = (x-7, y-4). \n\nTherefore, x -7 =1 => x=8. \n\ny -4=5 => y=9. \n\nSo, D=(8,9). \n\nThen, vector DA = (5 -8, 3 -9)=(-3,-6). \n\nVector BC = (1,-4). \n\nSo, vector DA is not equal to vector BC. \n\nTherefore, this is not a parallelogram. \n\nWait, so this approach also fails. \n\nHmm, maybe the three points are not in order. Let me try another method. \n\nSuppose the three points are A, B, C, and the fourth point is D. \n\nIn a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of AC should be the same as the midpoint of BD. \n\nMidpoint of AC: ((5 +7)/2, (3 +4)/2) = (6, 3.5). \n\nMidpoint of BD: ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). \n\nSetting equal: \n\n(6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 +x =12 => x=6. \n\n(8 + y)/2 =3.5 =>8 + y=7 => y= -1. \n\nSo, D=(6, -1). \n\nBut x=6, which is not greater than 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are A, C, B, and the fourth point is D. \n\nThen, the diagonals would be AC and BD. \n\nMidpoint of AC: (6,3.5). \n\nMidpoint of BD: ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). \n\nSetting equal: \n\n(6 +x)/2=6 =>x=6. \n\n(8 + y)/2=3.5 =>8 + y=7 =>y= -1. \n\nSame result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three points are A, B, D, and the fourth point is C. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the three given points are not in the order of the parallelogram.

Kaj je $\\tan A$?", "response": " \nOkay, so I need to find the tangent of angle A in this right-angled triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. The given information is that the sine of angle A is twice the cosine of angle A. Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities and relationships in right triangles.\n\nFirst, in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, and the cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. The tangent is the ratio of the opposite to the adjacent, which is sine over cosine. So, if I can find the sine and cosine of angle A, then I can compute the tangent.\n\nGiven that sin A = 2 cos A, maybe I can express both sine and cosine in terms of the same variable. Let's let cos A = x. Then, sin A = 2x. But in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean identity tells us that sin² A + cos² A = 1. So substituting the expressions in terms of x:\n\n(2x)² + x² = 1\n\nCalculating that:\n\n4x² + x² = 1\n\n5x² = 1\n\nx² = 1/5\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(1/5) or x = -sqrt(1/5). But since angle A is in a triangle, it must be between 0 and 90 degrees, so cosine of angle A is positive. Therefore, x = sqrt(1/5) = 1/sqrt(5). Rationalizing the denominator, that's sqrt(5)/5.\n\nSo cos A = sqrt(5)/5. Then, sin A = 2x = 2*(sqrt(5)/5) = 2sqrt(5)/5.\n\nNow, the tangent of angle A is sin A divided by cos A. Let's compute that:\n\ntan A = (2sqrt(5)/5) / (sqrt(5)/5) = (2sqrt(5)/5) * (5/sqrt(5)) = 2sqrt(5)*5 / (5*sqrt(5)) = 2sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) = 2.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. If sin A is 2sqrt(5)/5 and cos A is sqrt(5)/5, then dividing them gives 2sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) = 2. Yes, that's correct. So tan A is 2.\n\nBut let me verify using another method to make sure. In a right-angled triangle, if angle A is such that sin A = 2 cos A, then we can think of the sides. Let's say the adjacent side is 1, then the opposite side is 2, and the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1² + 2²) = sqrt(5). Then, tan A is opposite over adjacent, which is 2/1 = 2. Yep, that's the same result. So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the identity tan A = sin A / cos A, and since sin A = 2 cos A, then tan A = 2 cos A / cos A = 2. Yep, that's another way to see it. So regardless of the method, the answer is 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of tan A is 2. I think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Recognize that in a right-angled triangle, sin A = opposite/hypotenuse, cos A = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan A = opposite/adjacent.\n2. Given sin A = 2 cos A, set up the equation using the definitions.\n3. Use the Pythagorean identity to solve for cos A.\n4. Find sin A using the given ratio.\n5. Compute tan A by dividing sin A by cos A.\n6. Verify using the sides of the triangle.\n7. Confirm that the result is consistent with the trigonometric identity.\n\nAll steps check out, so I'm confident the answer is 2. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was using the given ratio to express both sine and cosine in terms of a single variable, then applying the Pythagorean identity to solve for that variable. Then, using that to find the tangent. That seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\tan A$ is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right-angled triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(\\angle B = 90^\\circ\\), we know that \\(\\sin A = 2 \\cos A\\).

I need to find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and then add them up. Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? So first, I should factor the denominator of the function f(x) = 2x / (x² - 5x - 14). Let me check if the denominator can be factored. \n\nLooking at x² -5x -14, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let's see: 2 and -7. Because 2 times -7 is -14, and 2 + (-7) is -5. So the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the denominator is (x + 2)(x - 7). So the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. That means a = -2 and b = 7. \n\nNow, horizontal asymptotes. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So c = 0. \n\nTherefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. So the answer should be 5. Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes: denominator factors to (x + 2)(x -7), so x = -2 and x =7. Correct. Horizontal asymptote: since degree of denominator > numerator, horizontal asymptote is y=0. Correct. So adding them up: -2 +7 +0=5. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI think that's it. No mistakes here. The key steps were factoring the denominator to find vertical asymptotes, comparing degrees to find horizontal asymptote, and then adding them. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So the final answer is 5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes, we factor the denominator of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\).

Therefore, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\\[\na + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).", "answer": "5"}

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but maybe there's a clever way to do it without having to multiply 99 by itself directly. Let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have expressions like (a - 1)^2, it expands to a squared minus 2a plus 1. Maybe that's similar to what's in this problem. Let me check. \n\nIf I take 99 and subtract 1, that gives me 98. Then, 98 squared would be (99 - 1)^2. Expanding that, it should be 99 squared minus 2*99 plus 1. So, 99² - 198 + 1. \n\nBut the original problem is 99² + 99 + 1. Let me write that down:\n\n99² + 99 + 1\n\nIf I compare this to the expanded form of (99 - 1)^2, which is 99² - 198 + 1, then maybe I can see a connection. \n\nWait, if I take the expression (99 - 1)^2, which is 99² - 198 + 1, and then add 198 to both sides, I get 99² - 198 + 1 + 198 = 99² + 1. \n\nBut in the original problem, we have 99² + 99 + 1. So, if I can relate this to (99 - 1)^2, maybe I can adjust it accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the expression. Let's see. \n\nLooking at 99² + 99 + 1. If I factor out 99 from the first two terms, I get 99*(99 + 1) + 1. But 99 + 1 is 100, so that becomes 99*100 + 1. Which is 9900 + 1 = 9901. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify that. \n\n99*100 is 9900, and adding 1 gives 9901. So, 99² + 99 + 1 equals 9901. \n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let's compute 99² first. 99 squared is 9801. Then, 9801 + 99 is 9900, and then adding 1 gives 9901. Yep, that matches. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for (a + 1)^3. Wait, no, that's different. Let me recall. \n\nWait, (a + 1)^3 = a³ + 3a² + 3a + 1. If I set a = 99, then (99 + 1)^3 = 100³ = 1,000,000. But that's not directly helpful here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity for (a + 1)^2. Wait, 99² is (100 - 1)^2, which is 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. Then, 9801 + 99 is 9801 + 90 + 9 = 9891 + 9 = 9900. Then, 9900 + 1 is 9901. \n\nSo, that's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)(a + 1) + 1. Let's see. \n\n(99 + 1)(99 + 1) + 1 = 100*100 + 1 = 10000 + 1 = 10001. Wait, that's not 9901. Hmm, so that approach is wrong. \n\nWait, maybe I confused something. Let me check. \n\nIf I compute (99 + 1)(99 + 1) + 1, that's 100*100 + 1 = 10000 + 1 = 10001. But that's not the same as 99² + 99 + 1. \n\nWait, 99² is 9801, 99 is 99, so 9801 + 99 is 9900, plus 1 is 9901. So, 9901 vs 10001. So, that's different. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 9901. \n\nBut let me check with another method. \n\nAnother way: 99² + 99 + 1. Let's compute 99² first. 99*99. \n\n99*99: 100*99 - 1*99 = 9900 - 99 = 9801. \n\nThen, 9801 + 99 = 9900. Then, 9900 + 1 = 9901. \n\nYes, that's the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^3. Wait, (a + 1)^3 = a³ + 3a² + 3a + 1. If a = 99, then (99 + 1)^3 = 1000000. But that's not helpful here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2. Wait, (a + 1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1. If a = 99, then (99 + 1)^2 = 10000. But that's not 99² + 99 + 1. \n\nWait, 99² + 99 + 1 is 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9901. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2 + a. Wait, (a + 1)^2 + a = a² + 2a + 1 + a = a² + 3a + 1. If a = 99, then 99² + 3*99 + 1 = 9801 + 297 + 1 = 10101 + 1 = 10102. But that's not 9901. \n\nSo, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2 + a - 1. Wait, (a + 1)^2 + a - 1 = a² + 2a + 1 + a - 1 = a² + 3a. If a = 99, then 99² + 3*99 = 9801 + 297 = 10098. Not 9901. \n\nHmm, so none of these methods seem to work. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's try to compute 99² first. \n\n99 squared is (100 - 1)^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. \n\nThen, 9801 + 99 = 9801 + 90 + 9 = 9891 + 9 = 9900. \n\nThen, 9900 + 1 = 9901. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2 + a - 1. Wait, (a + 1)^2 + a - 1 = a² + 2a + 1 + a - 1 = a² + 3a. If a = 99, then 99² + 3*99 = 9801 + 297 = 10098. Not 9901. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2 + a - 1. Wait, (a + 1)^2 + a - 1 = a² + 2a + 1 + a - 1 = a² + 3a. If a = 99, then 99² + 3*99 = 9801 + 297 = 10098. Not 9901. \n\nHmm, so maybe I need to think of another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that 99 is 100 - 1. So, 99² = (100 - 1)^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. Then, 99² + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1. \n\n9801 + 99 = 9801 + 100 - 1 = 9901 - 1 = 9900. Then, 9900 + 1 = 9901. \n\nYes, that's the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for (a + 1)^2 + a - 1. Wait, (a + 1)^2 + a - 1 = a² + 2a + 1 + a - 1 = a² + 3a.

That is, for all vectors v, the inequality ||A v|| ≤ C ||v|| holds, where A is the given matrix. \n\nFirst, let me recall that the norm of a matrix A is defined as the maximum value of ||A v|| / ||v|| over all non-zero vectors v. So, if I can compute the operator norm of A, that should be the minimal C. \n\nThe operator norm is also equal to the largest singular value of the matrix, which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of A^T A.

Then, A v = [2x + 3y, -2y]^T. \n\nThe norm of A v is sqrt[(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2] = sqrt[4x^2 + 12x y + 9y^2 + 4y^2] = sqrt[4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2]. \n\nThe norm of v is sqrt[x^2 + y^2]. \n\nSo, the ratio ||A v|| / ||v|| is sqrt[4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2] / sqrt[x^2 + y^2]. \n\nTo find the maximum of this ratio, we can consider the square of the ratio, which is [4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2] / [x^2 + y^2]. \n\nLet me denote this as f(x, y) = [4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2] / [x^2 + y^2]. \n\nTo find the maximum of f(x, y), we can use calculus. Let's set u = x^2 + y^2, then f(u) = [4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2] / u. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to use polar coordinates. Let x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. Then, f(r cos θ, r sin θ) = [4r^2 cos^2 θ + 12r^2 cos θ sin θ + 13r^2 sin^2 θ] / [r^2 (cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ)] = [4 cos^2 θ + 12 cos θ sin θ + 13 sin^2 θ] / 1. \n\nSo, f(θ) = 4 cos^2 θ + 12 cos θ sin θ + 13 sin^2 θ. \n\nTo find the maximum of this function over θ. \n\nLet me compute this expression. \n\nFirst, note that cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ = 1. \n\nSo, 4 cos^2 θ + 13 sin^2 θ = 4 cos^2 θ + 13(1 - cos^2 θ) = 4 cos^2 θ + 13 - 13 cos^2 θ = (4 - 13) cos^2 θ + 13 = -9 cos^2 θ + 13. \n\nThen, adding 12 cos θ sin θ: \n\nf(θ) = -9 cos^2 θ + 13 + 12 cos θ sin θ. \n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nf(θ) = -9 cos^2 θ + 12 cos θ sin θ + 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe express in terms of sin 2θ. \n\nRecall that cos^2 θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2, and sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ. \n\nSo, let's substitute:\n\n-9*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 + 12*(sin 2θ)/2 + 13\n\n= (-9/2 - 9/2 cos 2θ) + 6 sin 2θ + 13\n\n= (-9/2 + 13) + (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ)\n\n= (17/2) + (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ)\n\nSo, f(θ) = 17/2 + (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ). \n\nNow, to find the maximum of this expression. \n\nThe term -9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ is a sinusoidal function with amplitude sqrt[(-9/2)^2 + 6^2] = sqrt[81/4 + 36] = sqrt[81/4 + 144/4] = sqrt[225/4] = 15/2. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of -9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ is 15/2, and the minimum is -15/2. \n\nTherefore, the maximum of f(θ) is 17/2 + 15/2 = 32/2 = 16. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let's check again. \n\nWait, the expression is 17/2 + (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ). \n\nThe term (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ) has amplitude sqrt[(-9/2)^2 + 6^2] = sqrt[81/4 + 36] = sqrt[81/4 + 144/4] = sqrt[225/4] = 15/2. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of this term is 15/2, so the maximum of f(θ) is 17/2 + 15/2 = 32/2 = 16. \n\nBut that seems too high. Wait, but the maximum of the norm ratio is 16? But that can't be, because the norm of A v is sqrt[4x^2 + 12x y + 13y^2], and the norm of v is sqrt[x^2 + y^2]. \n\nWait, but if the maximum of f(θ) is 16, then the maximum of ||A v|| / ||v|| is 16, so the minimal C is 16. But that seems too large. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, when I computed f(θ) = 4 cos^2 θ + 12 cos θ sin θ + 13 sin^2 θ. \n\nExpressed in terms of sin 2θ and cos 2θ, that gives 17/2 + (-9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ). \n\nBut the maximum of -9/2 cos 2θ + 6 sin 2θ is 15/2, so the maximum of f(θ) is 17/2 + 15/2 = 32/2 = 16. \n\nBut that seems too high. Let me test with specific vectors. \n\nSuppose we take v = [1, 0]^T. Then, A v = [2, 0]^T, so ||A v|| = 2, ||v|| = 1, so ratio is 2. \n\nTake v = [0, 1]^T. Then, A v = [0, -2]^T, so ||A v|| = 2, ||v|| = 1, ratio is 2. \n\nTake v = [1, 1]^T. Then, A v = [2*1 + 3*1, -2*1]^T = [5, -2]^T. The norm is sqrt(25 + 4) = sqrt(29) ≈ 5.385. The norm of v is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. So the ratio is sqrt(29)/sqrt(2) ≈ 3.872. \n\nTake v = [1, -1]^T. Then, A v = [2*1 + 3*(-1), -2*(-1)] = [-1, 2]^T. The norm is sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. The norm of v is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. So the ratio is sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) ≈ 1.581. \n\nTake v = [2, 1]^T. Then, A v = [2*2 + 3*1, -2*1] = [7, -2]^T. The norm is sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53) ≈ 7.28. The norm of v is sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. So the ratio is sqrt(53)/sqrt(5) ≈ 4.78. \n\nTake v = [1, 2]^T. Then, A v = [2*1 + 3*2, -2*2] = [8, -4]^T. The norm is sqrt(64 + 16) = sqrt(80) ≈ 8.944. The norm of v is sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. So the ratio is sqrt(80)/sqrt(5) = sqrt(16) = 4. \n\nTake v = [2, -1]^T. Then, A v = [2*2 + 3*(-1), -2*(-1)] = [1, 2]^T. The norm is sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic exponent rules. I remember that any number raised to the power of 1 is 1, right? So, for example, 2^1 is 2, 3^1 is 3, and so on. But what about 1 raised to any power? Let's see. If I have 1^5, that's 1*1*1*1*1 = 1. Similarly, 1^1000 would also be 1. So, in general, 1 raised to any positive integer exponent is 1. \n\nWait, but here the exponent is 2^(235423523). That's a huge number, but the key point is that it's an exponent. So, regardless of how big the exponent is, as long as it's a positive integer, 1 raised to that power is still 1. \n\nLet me verify this with a smaller exponent. Let's take 1^2.

I need to find the value of \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\) where \\( z \\) is a complex number such that \\( z^5 = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\). Hmm, complex numbers with fifth roots of unity. \n\nFirst, I remember that the fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \\( z^5 = 1 \\). These roots are given by \\( z = e^{2\\pi i k / 5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). But since \\( z \\neq 1 \\), we can ignore \\( k = 0 \\), which is 1. So the other roots are \\( e^{2\\pi i / 5} \\), \\( e^{4\\pi i / 5} \\), \\( e^{6\\pi i / 5} \\), and \\( e^{8\\pi i / 5} \\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the sum \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express each term in terms of cosine and sine using Euler's formula, or perhaps find a pattern or use properties of roots of unity. \n\nAlternatively, since \\( z^5 = 1 \\), we know that \\( z^5 - 1 = 0 \\), which factors as \\( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \\). Since \\( z \\neq 1 \\), \\( z \\) must satisfy \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). That's a useful equation. \n\nSo, \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). Let me note that. Maybe I can use this equation to simplify the expression I need to compute. \n\nThe expression to compute is \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\). Let me see if I can express \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} \\) in terms of \\( z \\). \n\nSince \\( z^5 = 1 \\), multiplying both sides by \\( z^{-1} \\) gives \\( z^4 = z^{-1} \\).

So the sum \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\) is equal to -1. Therefore, the original expression \\( z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\) is equal to -1. \n\nBut let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with \\( z^5 = 1 \\), so \\( z^{-1} = z^4 \\), \\( z^{-2} = z^3 \\), etc. Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{z} = z^4 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \\). \n\nSo substituting into the expression:\n\n\\( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \\)\n\nWhich is the same as \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\). \n\nFrom the equation \\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \\)\n\nTherefore, the expression equals -1. \n\nSo, the answer should be -1. \n\nBut let me check with an example. Let's take \\( z = e^{2\\pi i / 5} \\), which is one of the primitive 5th roots of unity. Let's compute the expression numerically to see if it's indeed -1. \n\nFirst, compute \\( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \\). \n\nSince \\( z^5 = 1 \\), we can compute each term:\n\n\\( z = e^{2\\pi i / 5} \\approx 0.3090 + 0.9511i \\)\n\n\\( z^2 = e^{4\\pi i / 5} \\approx -0.8090 + 0.5878i \\)\n\n\\( z^3 = e^{6\\pi i / 5} \\approx -0.8090 - 0.5878i \\)\n\n\\( z^4 = e^{8\\pi i / 5} \\approx 0.3090 - 0.9511i \\)\n\nAdding them up:\n\nReal parts: 0.3090 - 0.8090 - 0.8090 + 0.3090 = (0.3090 + 0.3090) + (-0.8090 - 0.8090) = 0.6180 - 1.6180 = -1.0\n\nImaginary parts: 0.9511 - 0.5878 - 0.5878 - 0.9511 = (0.9511 - 0.9511) + (-0.5878 - 0.5878) = 0 - 1.1756 = -1.1756\n\nSo the sum is approximately -1.0 - 1.1756i, which is close to -1.

That's 5 - 1 = 4. So, the nines place in the result is 4. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. In base 9, each digit can only go up to 8. So, 5 is fine, and 1 is also okay.

Let me verify that. \n\nTo convert 40 base 9 to base 10, I can calculate 4*9^1 + 0*9^0 = 36 + 0 = 36. \n\nNow, let's convert 58 base 9 to base 10. 5*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 45 + 8 = 53. \n\nThen, subtract 53 - 36 = 8.

{"original_question": "Poenostavite\n\\[\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}.\\]", "question": "Poenostavite\n\\[\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}.\\]", "response": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: (sec x divided by sin x) minus (sin x divided by cos x). Hmm, let me start by recalling what each trigonometric function means. \n\nFirst, sec x is the reciprocal of cos x, right? So sec x = 1 / cos x. That might come in handy. Let me rewrite the first term using that. So the first part of the expression becomes (1 / cos x) divided by sin x. Dividing by sin x is the same as multiplying by 1/sin x. So that would be (1 / cos x) * (1 / sin x) = 1 / (cos x sin x). \n\nNow, the second term is sin x divided by cos x. That's just tan x, right? Because tan x is sin x over cos x. So the entire expression simplifies to 1/(cos x sin x) - tan x. \n\nWait, maybe I can combine these terms into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator. The first term is 1/(cos x sin x), and the second term is tan x, which is sin x / cos x. So the common denominator would be cos x sin x. Let me write both terms with that denominator.\n\nFirst term: 1/(cos x sin x) is already over the common denominator. Second term: tan x = sin x / cos x. To get the denominator to cos x sin x, I can multiply numerator and denominator by sin x. So tan x becomes (sin x * sin x) / (cos x * sin x) = sin²x / (cos x sin x). \n\nSo now the expression is [1 - sin²x] / (cos x sin x). \n\nHmm, I remember that 1 - sin²x is equal to cos²x. Because of the Pythagorean identity: sin²x + cos²x = 1, so 1 - sin²x = cos²x. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes cos²x. \n\nSo now the expression is cos²x / (cos x sin x). Let me simplify that. The cos x in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving cos x / sin x. Which is the same as cot x. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Starting from [1 - sin²x] / (cos x sin x). Since 1 - sin²x = cos²x, so that's cos²x / (cos x sin x). Then, cos²x divided by cos x is cos x, so we have cos x / sin x, which is cot x. \n\nSo the simplified form of the original expression is cot x. \n\nLet me verify this with a sample value to make sure. Let's take x = 45 degrees. Then sec 45 is √2, sin 45 is √2/2. So the first term is sec x / sin x = √2 / (√2/2) = √2 * 2 / √2 = 2. The second term is sin x / cos x = (√2/2) / (√2/2) = 1. So the expression is 2 - 1 = 1. \n\nNow, cot 45 degrees is 1, since cot x = 1/tan x, and tan 45 is 1, so cot 45 is 1. So that checks out. \n\nAnother test: x = 30 degrees. sec 30 is 2/√3, sin 30 is 1/2. First term: (2/√3) / (1/2) = (2/√3) * 2 = 4/√3. Second term: sin 30 / cos 30 = (1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3. So the expression is 4/√3 - 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3. \n\ncot 30 degrees is √3, since cot x = 1/tan x, and tan 30 is 1/√3, so cot 30 is √3. So that also checks out. \n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is indeed cot x. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{\\cot x}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), we start by rewriting each term using trigonometric identities.\n\n1. Rewrite \\(\\sec x\\) as \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos x}}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second term \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) is \\(\\tan x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\tan x\n   \\]\n\n3. Combine the two terms into a single fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\tan x\n   \\]\n\n4. Rewrite \\(\\tan x\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) and find a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x}\n   \\]\n\n5. Use the Pythagorean identity \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\sin x} = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression is \\(\\boxed{\\cot x}\\).", "answer": "\\cot x"}

The first tree has a certain number of squids, and the second tree has a different number. The total number of squids in both trees is equal to the number of trees multiplied by the number of squids in each tree. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"The first tree has a number of squids equal to the number of trees in the house. The second tree has a number of squids equal to the number of trees in the house. The total number of squids in both trees is equal to the number of trees in the house multiplied by the number of squids in each tree. How many squids are in each tree?\"\n\nHmm, so the first tree has the same number of squids as there are trees in the house. The second tree also has the same number of squids as there are trees. So, if there are two trees, each tree has two squids. Then the total number of squids is 2 + 2 = 4. But according to the problem, the total number of squids should also be equal to the number of trees multiplied by the number of squids in each tree. So, 2 trees * 2 squids per tree = 4. That matches. So, in this case, each tree has two squids. But the problem is asking how many squids are in each tree. Wait, but the problem says \"how many squids are in each tree?\" which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's asking for the number of squids in each tree, which is two. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is translated from another language, and \"squids\" is used in both the first and second tree. So, each tree has the same number of squids, which is equal to the number of trees. So, if there are two trees, each tree has two squids. Then the total is 4, which is 2 trees * 2 squids per tree.

I need to find the values of a and b such that when I multiply the two polynomials 3t² + 5t + a and 4t² + bt - 2, the result is 12t⁴ + 26t³ - 8t² -16t +6. Then, once I have a and b, I just need to add them together. Alright, let's start by multiplying the two polynomials step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to multiply two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the first polynomial is 3t² + 5t + a, and the second is 4t² + bt - 2. Let me write them out:\n\n(3t² + 5t + a) * (4t² + bt - 2)\n\nTo multiply these, I can use the distributive property. Let's break it down term by term.\n\nFirst, multiply 3t² by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴\n\n3t² * bt = 3bt³\n\n3t² * (-2) = -6t²\n\nNext, multiply 5t by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n5t * 4t² = 20t³\n\n5t * bt = 5bt²\n\n5t * (-2) = -10t\n\nThen, multiply a by each term in the second polynomial:\n\na * 4t² = 4at²\n\na * bt = abt\n\na * (-2) = -2a\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms together. Let's list them all:\n\n12t⁴ + 3bt³ -6t² + 20t³ + 5bt² -10t + 4at² + abt -2a\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. Let's group the terms by their exponents:\n\nt⁴ terms: 12t⁴\n\nt³ terms: 3bt³ + 20t³\n\nt² terms: -6t² + 5bt² + 4at²\n\nt terms: -10t + abt\n\nconstant terms: -2a\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n12t⁴ + (3b + 20)t³ + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t² + (-10 + ab)t -2a\n\nNow, according to the problem, this product should equal 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6. Therefore, the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal. Let's write down the equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of t⁴: 12 = 12 (This is already satisfied, so no new information here.)\n\n2. Coefficient of t³: 3b + 20 = 26\n\n3. Coefficient of t²: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\n4. Coefficient of t: -10 + ab = -16\n\n5. Constant term: -2a = 6\n\nSo, let's solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 5: -2a = 6\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\na = 6 / (-2) = -3\n\nSo, a = -3. That's the first value.\n\nNow, substitute a = -3 into equation 4: -10 + ab = -16\n\nSubstituting a = -3:\n\n-10 + (-3)b = -16\n\nSimplify:\n\n-10 -3b = -16\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n-3b = -16 + 10 = -6\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\nb = (-6)/(-3) = 2\n\nSo, b = 2.\n\nNow, let's check if these values satisfy the other equations. Let's check equation 2: 3b + 20 = 26\n\nSubstitute b = 2:\n\n3*2 + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26. That's correct.\n\nNow, check equation 3: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n\nSubstitute a = -3 and b = 2:\n\n-6 + 5*2 + 4*(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 = (-6 + 10) -12 = 4 -12 = -8. That's correct.\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied with a = -3 and b = 2. Therefore, a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.\n\nWait, let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, a = -3, b = 2.\n\nMultiply the polynomials:\n\n(3t² +5t -3)(4t² +2t -2)\n\nLet's compute term by term:\n\n3t² *4t² =12t⁴\n\n3t² *2t =6t³\n\n3t²*(-2) = -6t²\n\n5t *4t²=20t³\n\n5t*2t=10t²\n\n5t*(-2)=-10t\n\n-3*4t²=-12t²\n\n-3*2t=-6t\n\n-3*(-2)=6\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nt⁴:12t⁴\n\nt³:6t³ +20t³=26t³\n\nt²: -6t² +10t² -12t²= (-6 +10 -12)t²= (-8)t²\n\nt: -10t -6t= -16t\n\nconstant term:6\n\nSo, the product is 12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6, which matches the given polynomial.

I need to find the largest possible value of a such that the graph of the function f(x) intersects the line y = x exactly once. The function is defined piecewise: ax² for x ≥ a, and ax + 2a for x < a. Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I should recall that for a function to intersect a line exactly once, the equation f(x) = x must have exactly one solution. So, I need to solve for x in both cases and see under what conditions the total number of solutions is one. \n\nLet me start by considering the two cases separately. \n\n**Case 1: x ≥ a**  \nHere, f(x) = ax². So, setting ax² = x. Let's rearrange that:  \nax² - x = 0  \nx(ax - 1) = 0  \nSo, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 1/a. But wait, we have the condition that x ≥ a. So, we need to check if these solutions satisfy x ≥ a. \n\nSo, for x = 0:  \n0 ≥ a? That's only true if a ≤ 0. But if a is positive, then x = 0 is not in the domain x ≥ a. So, x = 0 is not a valid solution here.  \nFor x = 1/a:  \n1/a ≥ a? Let's solve this inequality.  \n1/a ≥ a  \nMultiply both sides by a² (since a² is positive, the inequality direction remains the same):  \na² ≥ a³  \nDivide both sides by a² (again, positive, so inequality remains):  \n1 ≥ a  \nSo, a ≤ 1. But since we are in the case x ≥ a, and x = 1/a, we need 1/a ≥ a. So, combining these, we have a ≤ 1 and 1/a ≥ a. Let's solve 1/a ≥ a.  \nMultiply both sides by a (but we need to be careful with the sign of a). Let's consider two subcases: a > 0 and a < 0.  \n\n**Subcase 1a: a > 0**  \nThen, multiplying both sides by a:  \n1 ≥ a²  \nSo, a² ≤ 1  \nThus, a ≤ 1. But since we are in the case a > 0, this gives 0 < a ≤ 1.  \nBut we also have the condition that 1/a ≥ a. Let's check if this holds for 0 < a ≤ 1.  \nTake a = 1: 1/1 = 1 ≥ 1, which is true.  \nTake a approaching 0: 1/a approaches infinity, which is greater than a. So, 1/a ≥ a holds for 0 < a ≤ 1.  \nTherefore, for a in (0, 1], x = 1/a is a valid solution.  \nBut x = 0 is not valid here. So, in Case 1, the only solution is x = 1/a, provided that 0 < a ≤ 1.  \n\n**Case 2: x < a**  \nHere, f(x) = ax + 2a. Setting this equal to x:  \nax + 2a = x  \nRearranging:  \nax - x = -2a  \nx(a - 1) = -2a  \nSo, x = (-2a)/(a - 1)  \nBut we have the condition that x < a. So, we need to check if this solution satisfies x < a.  \nLet's compute x:  \nx = (-2a)/(a - 1) = 2a/(1 - a)  \nSo, x = 2a/(1 - a).  \nWe need 2a/(1 - a) < a. Let's solve this inequality.  \nMultiply both sides by (1 - a). But we need to consider the sign of (1 - a).  \n\n**Subcase 2a: a ≠ 1**  \nCase 1: a < 1  \nThen, 1 - a > 0, so multiplying both sides by (1 - a) preserves the inequality:  \n2a < a(1 - a)  \n2a < a - a²  \nBring all terms to left:  \n2a - a + a² < 0  \na² + a < 0  \nBut a² + a = a(a + 1).  \nSo, a(a + 1) < 0.  \nThis inequality holds when a is between -1 and 0.  \nBut in this case, a < 1, so combining with a < 0, we get a ∈ (-1, 0).  \n\nCase 2: a > 1  \nThen, 1 - a < 0, so multiplying both sides by (1 - a) reverses the inequality:  \n2a > a(1 - a)  \n2a > a - a²  \nBring all terms to left:  \n2a - a + a² > 0  \na² + a > 0  \nWhich is always true for a ≠ 0. But since a > 1, this is always true.  \nTherefore, for a > 1, x = 2a/(1 - a) < a.  \nWait, let's check with a = 2: x = 2*2/(1 - 2) = 4/(-1) = -4. Then, -4 < 2, which is true. So, yes, for a > 1, x is negative, so x < a.  \nBut if a = 1, then x = 2*1/(1 - 1) is undefined. So, a = 1 is excluded.  \n\nSo, summarizing Case 2:  \nIf a < 1, then x = 2a/(1 - a) < a when a ∈ (-1, 0).  \nIf a > 1, then x = 2a/(1 - a) < a is always true.  \n\n**Case 3: a = 1**  \nWait, but a is a real number, not necessarily an integer. So, a = 1 is a separate case. Let's check.  \nIf a = 1, then in Case 1: f(x) = x². Setting x² = x gives x = 0 or x = 1. But x ≥ a = 1, so x = 1 is the only solution.  \nIn Case 2: f(x) = x + 2. Setting x + 2 = x gives 2 = 0, which is impossible. So, no solution.  \nTherefore, for a = 1, there is exactly one solution at x = 1. So, a = 1 is a valid value. But we need to check if this is the maximum. \n\nSo, summarizing all cases:  \n- For a < 0: No solutions.  \n- For 0 < a ≤ 1: x = 1/a is a solution.  \n- For a = 1: x = 1 is a solution.  \n- For a > 1: x = 2a/(1 - a) is a solution.  \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is:  \n- 0 if a < 0  \n- 1 if 0 < a ≤ 1  \n- 1 if a = 1  \n- 1 if a > 1  \n\nWait, but when a > 1, x = 2a/(1 - a) is negative, so x < a. So, in that case, there is one solution. So, for a > 1, there is one solution. For 0 < a ≤ 1, there is one solution. For a = 1, one solution. For a < 0, no solutions. So, the total number of solutions is 1 for a in (0, 1], and 1 for a = 1, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but when a = 1, the solution is x = 1, which is in the domain x ≥ a = 1. So, that's one solution. So, the total number of solutions is 1 for a in (0, 1], and 1 for a = 1, and 0 otherwise. So, the function intersects the line y = x exactly once when a is in (0, 1]. But the question is asking for the largest possible value of a such that the graph intersects the line exactly once. So, the maximum a in (0, 1] is 1. But wait, when a = 1, the solution is x = 1, which is in the domain x ≥ a = 1. So, that's one solution. So, the maximum a is 1. But wait, let me check if there's a case where a > 1 could give another solution. For example, if a > 1, then x = 2a/(1 - a) is negative, so x < a. So, that's one solution. So, for a > 1, there is one solution. So, the total number of solutions is 1 for a > 1, and 1 for a = 1, and 0 otherwise. So, the maximum a is 1.

I need to find the value of c such that the circle given by the equation x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0 has a radius of 1. Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I remember that the general equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. So, my goal is to rewrite the given equation into this standard form and then set the radius equal to 1. \n\nLet me start by completing the square for both x and y terms. \n\nStarting with the x terms: x² - 10x. To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is -10, so half of that is -5. Then square it, which is 25. So, x² - 10x + 25 - 25. That can be written as (x - 5)² - 25. \n\nNow the y terms: y² + 6y. Half of 6 is 3, square that to get 9. So, y² + 6y + 9 - 9. That becomes (y + 3)² - 9. \n\nPutting it all together, the original equation becomes:\n\n(x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 3)² - 9 + c = 0\n\nSimplify the constants: -25 -9 + c = -34 + c. So, the equation is:\n\n(x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = 34 - c\n\nBut wait, the standard form is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r². So, comparing, the radius squared is 34 - c. Since the radius is given as 1, then r² = 1² = 1. Therefore:\n\n34 - c = 1\n\nSolving for c:\n\nc = 34 - 1 = 33\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0\n\nCompleting the square:\n\nx² -10x +25 + y² +6y +9 = -c +25 +9\n\nSo, (x -5)² + (y +3)² = 34 - c\n\nSet equal to 1², so 34 - c =1 => c=33. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me verify by plugging back into the original equation. \n\nIf c=33, then the equation is x² -10x + y² +6y +33=0. \n\nCompleting the square:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + (y +3)^2 -9 +33=0\n\nSimplify: (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 -25 -9 +33=0\n\nWhich is (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 + (-25 -9 +33)=0\n\nCalculates to (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 + (-25 -9 +33)= (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 + (-14 +33)= (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 +19=0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, if the radius is 1, then the equation should be (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 =1. But according to the completed square, it's (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 +19=0. That would mean (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 = -19, which is impossible because squares can't be negative. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So, where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, let me check the original equation again. \n\nOriginal equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0\n\nCompleting the square for x: x² -10x +25 -25\n\nFor y: y² +6y +9 -9\n\nSo, (x -5)^2 -25 + (y +3)^2 -9 +c =0\n\nWhich is (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 -34 +c =0\n\nTherefore, (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 =34 -c\n\nSo, if the radius is 1, then 34 -c =1, so c=33. \n\nBut when I plug back into the original equation, I get (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 = -19, which is impossible.

So, (y +3)^2 -9.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + (y +3)^2 -9 +c =0\n\nWhich is (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 -34 +c =0\n\nTherefore, (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 =34 -c\n\nSo, if the radius is 1, then 34 -c =1, so c=33. \n\nBut when I plug back into the original equation, I get (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 = -19, which is impossible. So, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or in my calculations. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the radius is supposed to be 1, but the equation given is not in the standard form.

If the radius is 1, then -c +34 =1, so c=33. \n\nBut when I plug back into the original equation, I get (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 = -19, which is impossible.

I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that for some x in [0,1], f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is a quadratic function. Since λ is between 0 and 4, the coefficient of x² in f(x) would be -λ, so the parabola opens downward. The vertex of this parabola is at x = 1/2, right? Because the vertex of f(x) = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -λ and b = λ, so x = -λ/(2*(-λ)) = 1/2. So the maximum value of f(x) is at x = 1/2, which is f(1/2) = λ*(1/2)*(1 - 1/2) = λ*(1/2)*(1/2) = λ/4. Since λ is between 0 and 4, the maximum value of f(x) is λ/4, which is between 0 and 1, so the function maps [0,1] to [0, λ/4]. But since λ ≤ 4, λ/4 ≤ 1, so f(x) is indeed in [0,1] for all x in [0,1]. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem states that for some x in [0,1], f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So we need to find λ such that there exists an x where f(x) ≠ x, but applying f twice brings us back to x. So, in other words, x is a fixed point of f(f(x)), but not a fixed point of f itself. So, we need to find λ where the equation f(f(x)) = x has solutions, but f(x) ≠ x for those solutions.\n\nLet me write down the equation f(f(x)) = x. Let's compute f(f(x)) first. Since f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) = λ*(f(x))*(1 - f(x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)). So, f(f(x)) = λ² x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)). Setting this equal to x:\n\nλ² x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.\n\nAssuming x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but maybe we can simplify it. Let me denote y = x(1 - x). Then, the equation becomes:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λy) = 1.\n\nBut y = x(1 - x) is a quadratic in x, and its maximum value is 1/4 (at x = 1/2). So y ∈ [0, 1/4]. Let's see if we can express the equation in terms of y.\n\nFirst, note that x(1 - x) = y, so 1 - x = 1 - sqrt(y) or 1 + sqrt(y), but since x is in [0,1], 1 - x is in [0,1], so 1 - x = 1 - sqrt(y) only if x = sqrt(y). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf y = x(1 - x), then x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4y)]/2. Since x is in [0,1], we take the positive root: x = [1 + sqrt(1 - 4y)]/2. But since y ∈ [0, 1/4], sqrt(1 - 4y) ∈ [0,1]. So x = [1 + sqrt(1 - 4y)]/2. Therefore, 1 - x = 1 - [1 + sqrt(1 - 4y)]/2 = [1 - sqrt(1 - 4y)]/2.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\nλ² (1 - x)(1 - λy) = 1.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nλ² * [ (1 - sqrt(1 - 4y))/2 ] * [1 - λy] = 1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can set z = sqrt(1 - 4y). Then, y = z²/4, and 1 - y = 1 - z²/4. Then, 1 - x = [1 - z]/2, and 1 - λy = 1 - λz²/4. So substituting:\n\nλ² * [ (1 - z)/2 ] * [1 - λz²/4] = 1.\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\nλ² * (1 - z)/2 * (1 - λz²/4) = 1.\n\nMultiply the fractions:\n\nλ² * (1 - z)(1 - λz²/4) / 2 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nλ² (1 - z)(1 - λz²/4) = 2.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in z. Hmm, solving quartic equations can be tricky. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the original equation f(f(x)) = x. Let's denote f(x) = y, so f(y) = x. Therefore, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. y = λx(1 - x)\n2. x = λy(1 - y)\n\nSubstituting y from the first equation into the second:\n\nx = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, we can write:\n\nx = λ² x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nAssuming x ≠ 0, divide both sides by x:\n\n1 = λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).\n\nSo, 1 = λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²).\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, compute (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1*(1 - λx + λx²) - x*(1 - λx + λx²) = (1 - λx + λx²) - x + λx² - λx³.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³ = 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = λ² [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³].\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nλ² λx³ - λ² 2λx² + λ² (λ + 1)x - λ² + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, let's check the expansion again. Wait, the original equation after substitution is:\n\n1 = λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²).\n\nSo, expanding the right-hand side:\n\n1*(1 - λx + λx²) - x*(1 - λx + λx²) = 1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - (λ + 1)x + (λx² + λx²) - λx³ = 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n1 = λ² [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³].\n\nBring all terms to the left-hand side:\n\nλ² λx³ - λ² 2λx² + λ² (λ + 1)x - λ² + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: λ² λx³ = λ³ x³.\n\nSecond term: -λ² 2λx² = -2λ³ x².\n\nThird term: λ² (λ + 1)x = λ³ x + λ² x.\n\nFourth term: -λ² + 1.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + (λ³ x + λ² x) - λ² + 1 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nλ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ³ x + λ² x - λ² + 1 = 0.\n\nFactor out λ³ x³ - 2λ³ x² + λ³ x = λ³ x(x² - 2x + 1) = λ³ x(x - 1)^2.\n\nThen, the remaining terms: λ² x - λ² + 1.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nλ³ x(x - 1)^2 + λ² x - λ² + 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's consider specific values of λ where the equation might have solutions. For example, when λ = 0, the function f(x) = 0, so f(f(x)) = 0, which is not equal to x unless x = 0. But x = 0 is allowed, but f(0) = 0, so f(f(0)) = 0, which is equal to x. But the problem states that f(x) ≠ x for some x. So, when λ = 0, f(x) = 0, so f(f(x)) = 0, which is equal to x only when x = 0. But the problem says \"for some x in [0,1], f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x\". So, when λ = 0, the only solution is x = 0, which is allowed. But the problem says \"for some x\", so maybe λ = 0 is a solution? Wait, but when λ = 0, f(x) = 0, so f(f(x)) = 0, which is equal to x only when x = 0. So, in that case, the only solution is x = 0, which is allowed. But the problem says \"for some x\", so maybe λ = 0 is a solution? But the problem is asking for λ in [0,4], so maybe λ = 0 is allowed. But let's check.\n\nWait, when λ = 0, the function f(x) = 0, so f(f(x)) = 0, which is equal to x only when x = 0. So, in that case, the only solution is x = 0, which is allowed. But the problem says \"for some x\", so maybe λ = 0 is a solution? But the problem is asking for λ in [0,4], so maybe λ = 0 is allowed. But let's check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Naj bo λ=0,0≤λ≤4, in [0,1]definirana z=0,1,2,3,4.

Let me start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. \n\nFirst, let's look at the numerator:\n\nNumerator = cos 5° cos 20° + cos 35° cos 50° - sin 5° sin 20° - sin 35° sin 50°\n\nHmm, this looks like a combination of products of cosines and sines. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify this. \n\nI remember that cos A cos B - sin A sin B = cos(A + B) and sin A cos B + cos A sin B = sin(A + B). Let me check if I can apply these identities here.\n\nLooking at the first two terms: cos 5° cos 20° - sin 5° sin 20°. That should be cos(5° + 20°) = cos 25°.\n\nThen the next two terms: - sin 35° sin 50°. Wait, but there's a negative sign in front. Let me see. Maybe I can factor out the negative sign. So, - [sin 35° sin 50°]. \n\nBut then the entire numerator is cos 25° - sin 35° sin 50°. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me check the next part of the numerator: cos 35° cos 50° - sin 35° sin 50°. That would be cos(35° + 50°) = cos 85°. \n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator becomes cos 25° - sin 85°. \n\nWait, sin 85° is equal to cos 5°, because sin(90° - x) = cos x. So sin 85° = cos 5°. Therefore, the numerator simplifies to cos 25° - cos 5°. \n\nOkay, so numerator = cos 25° - cos 5°. \n\nNow, let's look at the denominator:\n\nDenominator = sin 5° cos 20° - sin 35° cos 50° + cos 5° sin 20° - cos 35° sin 50°\n\nHmm, this looks a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can group terms. \n\nLooking at the first two terms: sin 5° cos 20° + cos 5° sin 20°. That's sin(5° + 20°) = sin 25°. \n\nThen the next two terms: - sin 35° cos 50° - cos 35° sin 50°. That's - [sin 35° cos 50° + cos 35° sin 50°] = - sin(35° + 50°) = - sin 85°. \n\nSo the denominator simplifies to sin 25° - sin 85°. \n\nBut sin 85° is cos 5°, as before. So denominator = sin 25° - cos 5°. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (cos 25° - cos 5°) / (sin 25° - cos 5°). \n\nHmm, so tan θ = (cos 25° - cos 5°) / (sin 25° - cos 5°). \n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression. Let me compute the numerator and denominator numerically to see if I can find a pattern or a known angle. \n\nFirst, let's compute cos 25° and cos 5°. \n\ncos 25° ≈ 0.9063077870366499\n\ncos 5° ≈ 0.9961946980917455\n\nSo numerator ≈ 0.9063077870366499 - 0.9961946980917455 ≈ -0.0898869110550956\n\nDenominator: sin 25° ≈ 0.4226182617406944, and cos 5° ≈ 0.9961946980917455\n\nSo denominator ≈ 0.4226182617406944 - 0.9961946980917455 ≈ -0.5735764363510511\n\nTherefore, tan θ ≈ (-0.0898869110550956) / (-0.5735764363510511) ≈ 0.1564344642301835\n\nSo tan θ ≈ 0.1564344642301835. \n\nNow, I need to find θ such that tan θ ≈ 0.1564344642301835. \n\nLet me compute the arctangent of this value. \n\narctan(0.1564344642301835) ≈ 8.99999999999999°, which is approximately 9°. \n\nBut wait, 9° is a common angle. Let me check if 9° is indeed the solution. \n\nBut let me verify this more accurately. \n\nFirst, let's compute the exact value of the numerator and denominator. \n\nNumerator: cos 25° - cos 5°. \n\nUsing the formula for cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. \n\nSo cos 25° - cos 5° = -2 sin[(25° + 5°)/2] sin[(25° - 5°)/2] = -2 sin(15°) sin(10°). \n\nSimilarly, denominator: sin 25° - cos 5°. \n\nUsing the formula for sin A - cos B. \n\nBut maybe another approach. Let's compute sin 25° - cos 5°. \n\nExpress sin 25° as sin(30° - 5°) = sin 30° cos 5° - cos 30° sin 5° = 0.5 cos 5° - (√3/2) sin 5°. \n\nTherefore, sin 25° - cos 5° = 0.5 cos 5° - (√3/2) sin 5° - cos 5° = (-0.5 cos 5°) - (√3/2) sin 5°. \n\nSo denominator = -0.5 cos 5° - (√3/2) sin 5°. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is [ -2 sin 15° sin 10° ] / [ -0.5 cos 5° - (√3/2) sin 5° ] = [ 2 sin 15° sin 10° ] / [ 0.5 cos 5° + (√3/2) sin 5° ] \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 sin 15° sin 10°. \n\nDenominator: 0.5 cos 5° + (√3/2) sin 5°. \n\nLet me factor out 0.5 from the denominator: 0.5 [ cos 5° + √3 sin 5° ] \n\nSo denominator becomes 0.5 [ cos 5° + √3 sin 5° ] \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is [ 2 sin 15° sin 10° ] / [ 0.5 ( cos 5° + √3 sin 5° ) ] = [ 4 sin 15° sin 10° ] / [ cos 5° + √3 sin 5° ] \n\nHmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this. \n\nLet me recall that cos 5° + √3 sin 5° can be written as 2 sin(5° + 60°) = 2 sin 65°, because cos α + √3 sin α = 2 sin(α + 30°). Wait, let me check:\n\ncos α + √3 sin α = 2 sin(α + 30°). \n\nYes, because sin(α + 30°) = sin α cos 30° + cos α sin 30° = (√3/2) sin α + (1/2) cos α. \n\nTherefore, 2 sin(α + 30°) = √3 sin α + cos α. \n\nSo, cos 5° + √3 sin 5° = 2 sin(5° + 30°) = 2 sin 35°. \n\nTherefore, denominator becomes 2 sin 35°. \n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to [4 sin 15° sin 10°] / [2 sin 35°] = [2 sin 15° sin 10°] / sin 35° \n\nSo now, the expression is 2 sin 15° sin 10° / sin 35°. \n\nLet me compute this value. \n\nFirst, compute sin 15° ≈ 0.25881904510252074 \n\nsin 10° ≈ 0.17364817766693033 \n\nsin 35° ≈ 0.5735764363510462 \n\nTherefore, numerator: 2 * 0.25881904510252074 * 0.17364817766693033 ≈ 2 * 0.044948974288375 ≈ 0.08989794857675 \n\nDenominator: 0.5735764363510462 \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is ≈ 0.08989794857675 / 0.5735764363510462 ≈ 0.1564344642301835 \n\nWhich matches the earlier result. \n\nSo, tan θ ≈ 0.1564344642301835, which is approximately 0.1564344642301835. \n\nNow, I need to find θ such that tan θ ≈ 0.1564344642301835. \n\nLet me compute the arctangent of this value. \n\narctan(0.1564344642301835) ≈ 8.99999999999999°, which is approximately 9°. \n\nBut let me check if 9° is indeed the solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more exact value. \n\nWait, let's recall that 9° is 0.157079632679492 radians. \n\nBut 0.1564344642301835 is approximately 0.1564344642301835. \n\nBut 9° is 0.157079632679492 radians. \n\nSo, 0.1564344642301835 is very close to 9°, but not exactly. \n\nBut maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can relate this to a known angle. \n\nAlternatively, let's check if 9° is the exact value. \n\nWait, 9° is 0.157079632679492 radians. \n\nBut 0.1564344642301835 is approximately 0.157079632679492 - 0.0006451684493085 radians. \n\nBut 0.0006451684493085 radians is approximately 0.0006451684493085 * (180/π) ≈ 0.0006451684493085 * 57.29577951308232 ≈ 0.037°, which is about 0.222 minutes. \n\nSo, 9° is approximately 0.157079632679492 radians, and the value we have is approximately 0.157079632679492 - 0.0006451684493085 ≈ 0.1564344642301835 radians. \n\nBut 0.1564344642301835 radians is approximately 0.1564344642301835 * (180/π) ≈ 0.1564344642301835 * 57.29577951308232 ≈ 8.99999999999999°, which is 9°. \n\nTherefore, the value is approximately 9°, but not exactly. \n\nBut since the problem asks for the smallest positive angle θ in degrees, and given that the value is very close to 9°, and considering that 9° is a common angle, it's likely that the exact value is 9°. \n\nBut let me verify this more carefully. \n\nWait, let's compute tan 9°. \n\ntan", "answer": "120^\\circ"}

And the problem says \"načinov\" which in Catalan is \"combinations,\" so maybe that's the term they're looking for. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, the problem is about splitting the numbers 1 through 10 into two groups. Since the groups are unordered, I guess the order doesn't matter. So, for example, splitting into group A and group B is the same as splitting into group B and group A. Therefore, I need to calculate the number of combinations of 10 elements taken 5 at a time, right? Because each group will have 5 numbers, and the other group will automatically be the remaining 5. \n\nWait, but hold on. If I split the numbers into two groups of 5, then the number of ways would be the combination of 10 choose 5. But let me confirm. \n\nYes, in combinatorics, when you split a set into two equal parts, the number of ways is indeed the combination of n choose k, where k is half of n. So here, n is 10, so k is 5. Therefore, the number of ways should be C(10,5). \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"načinov\" which is Catalan for \"combinations,\" so that's correct. So, the answer should be the number of combinations of 10 elements taken 5 at a time. \n\nCalculating that, C(10,5) is 10! divided by (5! * 5!). Let me compute that. \n\n10! is 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. \n\n5! is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. \n\nSo, 10! / (5! * 5!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1). \n\nCalculating numerator: 10 × 9 = 90, 90 × 8 = 720, 720 × 7 = 5040, 5040 × 6 = 30240. \n\nDenominator: 5 × 4 = 20, 20 × 3 = 60, 60 × 2 = 120, 120 × 1 = 120. \n\nSo, 30240 / 120. Let's divide 30240 by 120. \n\n120 × 252 = 30240. \n\nYes, because 120 × 200 = 24000, 120 × 50 = 6000, so 24000 + 6000 = 30000, and 30240 - 30000 = 240, so 240 / 120 = 2. So total is 2000 + 252 + 2 = 2252. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 252 + 2 is 254, but 2252? That seems too high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nWait, 30240 divided by 120. Let's do it step by step. \n\n30240 ÷ 120. \n\n120 × 250 = 30,000. \n\n30,000 - 30,240 = -240. \n\nSo, 250 - 240/120 = 250 - 2 = 248. So 250 - 2 = 248. Wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe I need to do it properly. \n\nAlternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 10: 3024 / 12. \n\n3024 ÷ 12. \n\n12 × 250 = 3000. \n\n3024 - 3000 = 24. \n\n24 ÷ 12 = 2. \n\nSo total is 250 + 2 = 252. \n\nSo, 30240 / 120 = 252. \n\nTherefore, C(10,5) = 252. \n\nBut wait, let me check another way. \n\nAnother way to compute combinations is using the formula n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, 10! / (5!5!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1). \n\nCalculating numerator: 10 × 9 = 90, 90 × 8 = 720, 720 × 7 = 5040, 5040 × 6 = 30240. \n\nDenominator: 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. \n\nSo, 30240 ÷ 120. \n\nDivide 30240 by 120. \n\n120 × 200 = 24,000. \n\n30,240 - 24,000 = 6,240. \n\n6,240 ÷ 120 = 52. \n\nSo total is 200 + 52 = 252. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of ways to split the numbers 1 through 10 into two groups of 5 is 252. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? For example, if the groups are unordered, then splitting into group A and group B is the same as splitting into group B and group A. So, we need to divide by 2 to account for that. \n\nBut in this case, since we are splitting into two groups of 5, each group is automatically the complement of the other. So, the number of ways is indeed C(10,5)/2. \n\nBut wait, C(10,5) is 252, so 252 / 2 = 126. \n\nWait, but hold on. If we split into two groups of 5, then the number of ways is C(10,5)/2. Because each split is counted twice. For example, splitting into group A and group B is the same as splitting into group B and group A. So, we need to divide by 2. \n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just \"načinov\" which is Catalan for \"combinations,\" so that's correct. So, the answer is 252. \n\nBut let me check with another method. \n\nAnother way to compute combinations is using the formula n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, 10! / (5!5!) = 3628800 / (120 × 120) = 3628800 / 14400 = 252. \n\nYes, that's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, using the binomial coefficient formula. \n\nC(10,5) = 10 choose 5 = 252. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 252. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to think about this. \n\nSuppose we have 10 distinct objects, and we want to split them into two groups of 5. The number of ways is C(10,5). But since the groups are unordered, we divide by 2. So, 252 / 2 = 126. \n\nBut wait, hold on. If we split into two groups of 5, then the number of ways is C(10,5)/2. But in the problem statement, it's just \"načinov\" which is Catalan for \"combinations,\" so that's correct. \n\nBut let me check with an example. \n\nSuppose we have 2 numbers, 1 and 2. The number of ways to split them into two groups of 1 is 1. Which is C(2,1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. \n\nIf we have 3 numbers, 1, 2, 3. The number of ways to split them into two groups of 1 and 2 is C(3,1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5, but since we can't have half a way, we need to consider that splitting into group A and group B is the same as group B and group A. So, the number of ways is 3. Which is C(3,1) = 3. \n\nWait, but in the case of 3 numbers, splitting into two groups of 1 and 2 is the same as splitting into two groups of 2 and 1. So, the number of ways is 3. \n\nBut according to the formula, C(3,1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5, which is not an integer. But since we can't have half a way, we need to consider that splitting into two groups of 1 and 2 is the same as splitting into two groups of 2 and 1. So, the number of ways is 3. \n\nBut according to the formula, C(3,1) = 3, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula C(n,k)/2 is correct when n is even, and when n is odd, the number of ways is C(n,k)/2. \n\nBut in our case, n=10, which is even, so the number of ways is C(10,5)/2 = 252/2 = 126. \n\nBut wait, in the case of 3 numbers, splitting into two groups of 1 and 2 is the same as splitting into two groups of 2 and 1, so the number of ways is 3.

Let me recall how trailing zeros work. \n\nFirst, I remember that a trailing zero is created by a factor of 10 in the number. Since 10 is 2 times 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of the number contributes to a trailing zero. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in 42!, which is equivalent to the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factors. \n\nBut wait, in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. That's because each 5 can pair with a 2 to make a 10, and once there are no more 2s left, the number of 5s will limit the number of trailing zeros. \n\nSo, the task reduces to finding the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 42!. That exponent will be the number of trailing zeros. \n\nTo find the exponent of a prime p in n!, we use the formula:\n\nExponent of p = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p²) + floor(n/p³) + ...\n\nWhere floor(x) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. \n\nSo, for our problem, p is 5 and n is 42. Let's apply the formula step by step. \n\nFirst, compute floor(42/5):\n\n42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so floor(8.4) is 8. \n\nNext, floor(42/25):\n\n42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so floor(1.68) is 1. \n\nThen, floor(42/125):\n\n42 divided by 125 is 0.336, so floor(0.336) is 0. \n\nSince 125 is greater than 42, all higher terms will be zero. \n\nTherefore, the exponent of 5 in 42! is 8 + 1 + 0 = 9. \n\nSo, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me verify the calculation again. \n\nFirst term: floor(42/5) = 8. \n\nSecond term: floor(42/25) = 1. \n\nThird term: floor(42/125) = 0. \n\nYes, that adds up to 9. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using the formula for the number of times a prime divides into n! which is the sum of floor(n/p^k) for k from 1 to infinity. \n\nSo, for p=5, k=1: floor(42/5)=8, k=2: floor(42/25)=1, k=3: floor(42/125)=0, and so on. So yes, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the number of trailing zeros: \n\nNumber of trailing zeros = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\nWhich is exactly what I did. \n\nSo, 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, floor is 8. 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, floor is 1. 42 divided by 125 is 0.336, floor is 0. So total 9. \n\nTherefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check with a smaller factorial to see if the method works. \n\nFor example, 5! = 120. The number of trailing zeros is 1. Let's apply the formula. \n\nExponent of 5 in 5! is floor(5/5) = 1. So 1 trailing zero. Correct. \n\nAnother example: 10! = 3628800. Trailing zeros: 2. \n\nExponent of 5 in 10! is floor(10/5) + floor(10/25) = 2 + 0 = 2. Correct. \n\nSo the method works. Therefore, applying it to 42! gives 9 trailing zeros. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key insight is that the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors, which is calculated by the sum of floor(n/p^k) for k=1 to infinity. Since 5^3=125 is greater than 42, the sum stops at k=2. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 9. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to find the exponent of 5 in its prime factorization. This is because each trailing zero is formed by a pair of 2 and 5, and there are generally more 2s than 5s in the factorial.\n\nThe exponent of 5 in \\(42!\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent of } 5 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8.4 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1.68 \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.336 \\right\\rfloor = 0\n\\]\n\nSumming these values gives the exponent of 5:\n\\[\n8 + 1 + 0 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).", "answer": "9"}

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with functions of two variables, the maximum can occur either at critical points inside the domain or on the boundary. So maybe I should start by finding the critical points inside the square \\([-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]\\) and then check the boundaries. \n\nTo find critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), set them equal to zero, and solve the system of equations. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \\cdot (-2y) \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \\)\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\cdot (-2x) \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\)\n\nNow, setting both partial derivatives to zero:\n\n1. \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \\)\n\nLet me solve the first equation. Let's denote \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\) as \\( A \\) and \\( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) as \\( B \\). Then the equations become:\n\n1. \\( A - \\frac{xy}{A} = 0 \\)\n2. \\( B - \\frac{xy}{B} = 0 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\( A = \\frac{xy}{A} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( A \\):\n\n\\( A^2 = xy \\)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n\\( B = \\frac{xy}{B} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( B \\):\n\n\\( B^2 = xy \\)\n\nSo, both equations give \\( xy = A^2 = B^2 \\). Therefore, \\( A^2 = B^2 \\), which implies \\( A = B \\) or \\( A = -B \\). But since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are square roots, they are non-negative. Therefore, \\( A = B \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\( 1 - y^2 = 1 - x^2 \\)\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides:\n\n\\( -y^2 = -x^2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( y^2 = x^2 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( y = x \\) or \\( y = -x \\).\n\nSo, the critical points occur when \\( y = x \\) or \\( y = -x \\). Now, let's substitute these into the original equations to find the corresponding \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFirst, consider \\( y = x \\). Then, from \\( xy = A^2 \\), we have \\( x^2 = (1 - x^2) \\), since \\( A = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\( x^2 = 1 - x^2 \\)\n\nAdding \\( x^2 \\) to both sides:\n\n\\( 2x^2 = 1 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x^2 = 1/2 \\), so \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{1/2} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nSimilarly, since \\( y = x \\), \\( y = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the critical points are \\( \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\) and \\( \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nNow, check the other case where \\( y = -x \\). Then, from \\( xy = A^2 \\), we have \\( -x^2 = (1 - x^2) \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( -x^2 = 1 - x^2 \\)\n\nAdding \\( x^2 \\) to both sides:\n\n\\( 0 = 1 \\)\n\nWhich is impossible. Therefore, there are no critical points when \\( y = -x \\). So, only the points \\( \\left( \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\) are critical points.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate \\( f(x, y) \\) at these critical points and also check the boundaries of the domain, which are the edges of the square \\([-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]\\).\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( f \\) at the critical points.\n\nTake \\( \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\):\n\n\\( f\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2} \\)\n\nCompute \\( \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2} \\):\n\n\\( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2}{4}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore, each term is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the sum is \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\), the same calculation applies, so \\( f \\) is also 1.\n\nTherefore, the critical points give \\( f = 1 \\).\n\nNow, we need to check the boundaries. The boundaries are the four edges of the square: \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = -1 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), \\( y = -1 \\).\n\nLet's check each edge one by one.\n\n1. Edge \\( x = 1 \\):\n\nOn this edge, \\( x = 1 \\), so \\( f(1, y) = 1 \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\cdot 0 = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\)\n\nThe maximum of \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\) on \\( y \\in [-1, 1] \\) is 1 (when \\( y = 0 \\)).\n\n2. Edge \\( x = -1 \\):\n\nSimilarly, \\( f(-1, y) = -1 \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\cdot 0 = -\\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\)\n\nThe maximum of \\( -\\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\) is 0 (when \\( y = 0 \\)), and the minimum is -1 (when \\( y = \\pm 1 \\)).\n\n3. Edge \\( y = 1 \\):\n\nOn this edge, \\( y = 1 \\), so \\( f(x, 1) = x \\sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 + \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\)\n\nMaximum of \\( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) is 1 (when \\( x = 0 \\)).\n\n4. Edge \\( y = -1 \\):\n\nSimilarly, \\( f(x, -1) = x \\sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\)\n\nMaximum of \\( -\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) is 0 (when \\( x = 0 \\)), and minimum is -1 (when \\( x = \\pm 1 \\)).\n\nSo, on all four edges, the maximum value of \\( f \\) is 1, achieved at the corners \\( (1, 0) \\), \\( (-1, 0) \\), \\( (0, 1) \\), \\( (0, -1) \\). Wait, but hold on. Wait, when we checked the edges, we saw that on \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\), the maximum is 1, but on \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( y = -1 \\), the maximum is 1 as well. Wait, but when \\( x = 1 \\), the function is \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\), which has maximum 1 at \\( y = 0 \\). Similarly, when \\( x = -1 \\), the function is \\( -\\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\), which has maximum 0 at \\( y = 0 \\). Wait, but when \\( x = -1 \\), the function is \\( -\\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\), so the maximum is 0, achieved at \\( y = 0 \\). Similarly, on \\( y = 1 \\), the function is \\( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\), which has maximum 1 at \\( x = 0 \\). On \\( y = -1 \\), the function is \\( -\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\), which has maximum 0 at \\( x = 0 \\). So, the maximum on the edges is indeed 1, achieved at the corners.\n\nBut wait, the corners are \\( (1, 0) \\), \\( (-1, 0) \\), \\( (0, 1) \\), \\( (0, -1) \\). Let's compute \\( f \\) at these points:\n\nAt \\( (1, 0) \\):\n\n\\( f(1, 0) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 0} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1 \\)\n\nAt \\( (-1, 0) \\):\n\n\\( f(-1, 0) = -1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 0} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1} = -1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = -1 \\)\n\nAt \\( (0, 1) \\):\n\n\\( f(0, 1) = 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1} + 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 0} = 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n\nAt \\( (0, -1) \\):\n\n\\( f(0, -1) = 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1} + (-1) \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 0} = 0 - 1 = -1 \\)\n\nSo, the maximum on the edges is indeed 1, achieved at the corners \\( (1, 0) \\), \\( (-1, 0) \\), \\( (0, 1) \\), \\( (0, -1) \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are between -1 and 1. So, the corners are within the domain. Therefore, the maximum value on the boundaries is 1.\n\nBut wait, the critical points we found earlier also give 1. So, the maximum value is 1. But let me check if there are any other critical points or if the maximum is indeed 1.\n\nWait, but when we considered the critical points, we found that the maximum on the boundaries is 1, and the critical points also give 1. So, perhaps the maximum is 1. But let me check another point.\n\nWait, let's take \\( x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), which is a critical point. Then, \\( f = 1 \\). Similarly, \\( x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) also give \\( f = 1 \\). So, these are the only critical points.\n\nBut wait, let's check another point. For example, take \\( x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) and \\( y = 0 \\). Then, \\( f = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 \\), which is less than 1. Similarly, \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), \\( f = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 \\). So, these points are lower.\n\nAlternatively, take \\( x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), which we already checked, gives 1. Similarly, \\( x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), gives", "answer": "1"}

The vectors are OA = [1, 2, 3] and OB = [-3, -2, 1]. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product of those vectors. The magnitude of the cross product divided by 2 should give the area. Let me verify that. Yes, the area of a triangle with sides represented by vectors OA and OB is (1/2) times the magnitude of the cross product of OA and OB. So, I need to compute OA × OB, find its magnitude, and then divide by 2. \n\nAlright, let's start by computing the cross product. The cross product of two vectors in 3D space is calculated using the determinant of a matrix. The formula is:\n\nOA × OB = |i   j   k|\n             |1   2   3|\n             |-3 -2   1|\n\nSo, expanding this determinant:\n\ni*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))\n\nLet me compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst component (i): 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSecond component (j): -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10\n\nThird component (k): 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4\n\nSo, OA × OB = [8, -10, 4]\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(8² + (-10)² + 4²). Let's compute that:\n\n8² = 64\n\n(-10)² = 100\n\n4² = 16\n\nAdding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180\n\nSo, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Let me simplify that. 180 factors into 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, the magnitude is 6√5.\n\nThen, the area of the triangle is (1/2)*|OA × OB| = (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, cross product components:\n\ni: 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. Correct.\n\nj: -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.\n\nk: 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo, cross product is [8, -10, 4]. Then magnitude is sqrt(8² + (-10)² + 4²) = sqrt(64 + 100 + 16) = sqrt(180). 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Then area is (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. The area can also be calculated using the formula involving the base and height. But since we have vectors, the cross product method is more straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider vectors OA and OB, the area is (1/2)|OA × OB|. Since cross product gives the area of the parallelogram, half of that is the area of the triangle. So, that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the area should be 3√5. Let me check if there's any other way to compute this. For example, if I use coordinates, maybe compute the vectors OA and OB, then use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. \n\nBut since we already have the cross product, that's probably the most efficient method. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way. For instance, if I can find the angle between OA and OB, then the area is (1/2)|OA||OB|sinθ. But since we have vectors, maybe that's another approach. \n\nFirst, compute the magnitudes of OA and OB. \n\n|OA| = sqrt(1² + 2² + 3²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 9) = sqrt(14)\n\n|OB| = sqrt((-3)² + (-2)² + 1²) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(14)\n\nSo, |OA| = |OB| = sqrt(14). Then, the area would be (1/2)*sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)*sinθ = (1/2)*14*sinθ = 7 sinθ. \n\nBut we can compute sinθ using the cross product. The cross product magnitude is |OA × OB| = 6√5. So, 6√5 = |OA||OB|sinθ = sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)*sinθ = 14 sinθ. Therefore, 6√5 = 14 sinθ => sinθ = (6√5)/14 = (3√5)/7. \n\nThen, the area is (1/2)*14*(3√5)/7 = (7)*(3√5)/7 = 3√5. So, same result. \n\nTherefore, all methods lead to the same answer. So, I can be confident that the area is 3√5. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of triangle \\(OAB\\) is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of triangle \\(OAB\\) where vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we use the cross product of the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n-3 & -2 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{i} \\left(2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-2)\\right) - \\mathbf{j} \\left(1 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-3)\\right) + \\mathbf{k} \\left(1 \\cdot (-2) - 2 \\cdot (-3)\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n- For \\(\\mathbf{i}\\): \\(2 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8\\)\n- For \\(\\mathbf{j}\\): \\(-(1 \\cdot 1 - 3 \\cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10\\)\n- For \\(\\mathbf{k}\\): \\(1 \\cdot (-2) - 2 \\cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4\\)\n\nThus, the cross product is:\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of this cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} \\right| = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \\sqrt{180} = 6\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nThe area of triangle \\(OAB\\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle \\(OAB\\) is \\(\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}\\).", "answer": "3 \\sqrt{5}"}

So, \\( z^4 + \\frac{1}{z^4} = (z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2})^2 - 2 \\).\n\nPlugging in the value for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\( \\left( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 - 2 \\).\n\nCompute that:\nFirst, square \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\):\n\\( \\frac{(-1 + \\sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \\frac{1 - 2\\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nThen subtract 2:\n\\( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( z^4 + \\frac{1}{z^4} = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nHmm, interesting. Let's check \\( n = 4 \\). Maybe there's a pattern here.

I need to find the area of triangle GAN given that the area of triangle ABC is 144. Hmm, first, I should recall some properties of medians and centroids in triangles. \n\nSo, in triangle ABC, medians AD and BE intersect at the centroid G. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. Also, the centroid is the common intersection point of the medians. \n\nNow, the problem mentions that a line through G, which is parallel to BC, intersects AB at M and AC at N. I need to find the area of triangle GAN. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Let me sketch triangle ABC with medians AD and BE. The centroid G is where they meet. Then, a line through G parallel to BC would cut AB at M and AC at N. Since it's parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC should be similar. \n\nWait, but how does the centroid's position affect this? The centroid divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. So, if I draw a line through G parallel to BC, which is a median, then the line would intersect AB and AC at points M and N. Since the centroid is 2/3 of the way along the median from the vertex, maybe the line through G parallel to BC would create a smaller triangle AMN that is similar to ABC, scaled down by some factor. \n\nBut how do I find the ratio of similarity? Since the line is parallel to BC, the triangles AMN and ABC are similar. The ratio of their areas would be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So, if I can find the ratio of AM to AB, that would be the ratio of similarity, and then the area of AMN would be (AM/AB)^2 times the area of ABC. \n\nBut how do I find AM/AB? Since G is the centroid, which is 2/3 along the median. Wait, but the line through G parallel to BC is not the same as the median. Hmm, maybe I need to use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle to make it easier. \n\nLet me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me set point B at (0, 0), point C at (2c, 0), and point A somewhere in the plane. Wait, but maybe it's better to set coordinates such that BC is along the x-axis. Let me try that. Let me set point B at (0, 0), point C at (2c, 0), and point A at (a, b). Then, the centroid G would be at the average of the coordinates: ((a + 0 + 2c)/3, (b + 0 + 0)/3) = ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). \n\nNow, the median AD goes from A(a, b) to D, the midpoint of BC. The midpoint D of BC is ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (c, 0). So, the median AD is from (a, b) to (c, 0). The centroid G is at ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). \n\nNow, the line through G parallel to BC. Since BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (2c, 0), a line parallel to BC would also be horizontal. So, the line through G parallel to BC is horizontal at y = b/3. \n\nThis line intersects AB and AC at points M and N. Let me find the coordinates of M and N. \n\nFirst, let's find the equation of AB. Points A(a, b) and B(0, 0). The slope of AB is (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a. So, the equation of AB is y = (b/a)x. \n\nThe line through G parallel to BC is y = b/3. To find point M, which is the intersection of y = b/3 and AB. So, set (b/a)x = b/3. Solving for x: x = (b/3) * (a/b) = a/3. Therefore, point M is at (a/3, b/3). \n\nSimilarly, to find point N, which is the intersection of y = b/3 and AC. Let's find the equation of AC. Points A(a, b) and C(2c, 0). The slope of AC is (0 - b)/(2c - a) = -b/(2c - a). So, the equation of AC is y - b = (-b/(2c - a))(x - a). \n\nSet y = b/3 in this equation: b/3 - b = (-b/(2c - a))(x - a). Simplify left side: -2b/3 = (-b/(2c - a))(x - a). Multiply both sides by (2c - a)/(-b): (2c - a)/3 = x - a. Therefore, x = a + (2c - a)/3 = (3a + 2c - a)/3 = (2a + 2c)/3 = 2(a + c)/3. \n\nTherefore, point N is at (2(a + c)/3, b/3). \n\nNow, we have coordinates for points M(a/3, b/3) and N(2(a + c)/3, b/3). \n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangle GAN. Points G, A, N. Let's find their coordinates. \n\nPoint G is ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). Point A is (a, b). Point N is (2(a + c)/3, b/3). \n\nTo find the area of triangle GAN, we can use the shoelace formula. Let's list the coordinates:\n\nG: ((a + 2c)/3, b/3)\n\nA: (a, b)\n\nN: (2(a + c)/3, b/3)\n\nLet me write them in order: G, A, N. \n\nShoelace formula: \n\nArea = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nx1 = (a + 2c)/3, y1 = b/3\n\nx2 = a, y2 = b\n\nx3 = 2(a + c)/3, y3 = b/3\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = (a + 2c)/3 * (b - b/3) = (a + 2c)/3 * (2b/3) = (2b(a + 2c))/9\n\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = a * (b/3 - b/3) = a * 0 = 0\n\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = 2(a + c)/3 * (b/3 - b) = 2(a + c)/3 * (-2b/3) = -4b(a + c)/9\n\nSum of terms: (2b(a + 2c))/9 + 0 - 4b(a + c)/9 = [2b(a + 2c) - 4b(a + c)] / 9\n\nFactor out 2b: 2b[ (a + 2c) - 2(a + c) ] / 9 = 2b[ a + 2c - 2a - 2c ] / 9 = 2b[ -a ] / 9 = -2ab/9\n\nTake absolute value and multiply by 1/2: | -2ab/9 | * 1/2 = (2ab)/9 * 1/2 = ab/9\n\nSo, the area of triangle GAN is ab/9. \n\nBut we know the area of triangle ABC is 144. Let's recall the area of ABC. \n\nPoints A(a, b), B(0, 0), C(2c, 0). The area is 1/2 * base * height. The base BC is 2c, and the height is the y-coordinate of A, which is b. So, area is 1/2 * 2c * b = bc. Therefore, bc = 144. \n\nBut in triangle GAN, the area is ab/9. So, we need to express ab in terms of bc. \n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the area is bc = 144. In triangle GAN, the area is ab/9. So, if we can express ab in terms of bc, then we can find the area. \n\nBut how? Let's see. In triangle ABC, the coordinates of A are (a, b), so a and b are the coordinates. In triangle GAN, the coordinates of A are (a, b), and G is ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). So, the area of GAN is ab/9. \n\nBut we need to relate ab to bc. Let's see. In triangle ABC, the area is bc = 144. In triangle GAN, the area is ab/9. So, if we can express ab in terms of bc, then we can find the area. \n\nBut how? Let's think. In triangle ABC, the coordinates of A are (a, b), so a and b are the coordinates. In triangle GAN, the coordinates of A are (a, b), and G is ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). So, the area of GAN is ab/9. \n\nBut we need to find ab. Let's see. In triangle ABC, the area is bc = 144. In triangle GAN, the area is ab/9. So, if we can express ab in terms of bc, then we can find the area. \n\nBut how? Let's think. Let's consider the ratio of the areas. The area of GAN is ab/9, and the area of ABC is bc = 144. So, the ratio of the areas is (ab/9) / (bc) = (ab)/(9bc) = a/(9c). \n\nBut we need to find a/(9c). How can we relate a and c? Let's see. In triangle ABC, the coordinates of A are (a, b), and the coordinates of C are (2c, 0). The centroid G is at ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). \n\nBut we need to find a relationship between a and c. Let's see. The centroid divides the median AD in the ratio 2:1. The median AD goes from A(a, b) to D(c, 0). The centroid G is at ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). \n\nBut we also know that in triangle ABC, the coordinates of A are (a, b), and the coordinates of C are (2c, 0). The centroid G is at ((a + 2c)/3, b/3). \n\nBut we need to find a relationship between a and c. Let's see. Let's consider the coordinates of A and C.

Let's consider the line through G parallel to BC. The line through G parallel to BC is horizontal at y = b/3. This line intersects AB at M(a/3, b/3) and AC at N(2(a + c)/3, b/3). \n\nBut how does this help us find a relationship between a and c? Let's think about the coordinates. \n\nIn triangle ABC, the coordinates of A are (a, b), and the coordinates of C are (2c, 0).

I need to find the volume of a pyramid, right? The formula is V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. The problem gives me the base area (B) as 30 square units and the height (h) as 6.5 units. So, plugging those numbers into the formula should give me the volume. \n\nLet me write that down step by step. First, I remember that the volume of a pyramid is one-third of the base area multiplied by the height. So, if I have B = 30 and h = 6.5, then V = (1/3)*30*6.5. \n\nWait, let me check if I did the multiplication correctly. 30 times 6.5. Hmm, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. So, 180 + 15 is 195. Then, dividing by 3 gives 65. So, the volume should be 65 cubic units. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The problem says \"površina osnovne ploskve\" which is the same as the base area, so B is indeed 30. The \"višina\" is the height, which is 6.5. So, yes, the formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify by breaking it down. If I have a pyramid with a base area of 30 and height 6.5, then the volume is 1/3 of 30*6.5. Let me compute 30*6.5 first. 30*6 is 180, and 30*0.5 is 15, so 180+15=195. Then 195 divided by 3 is 65. Yep, same result. \n\nI think that's it. The key was remembering the formula and plugging in the given values. No need to think about the shape of the base or the type of pyramid, since the formula applies generally. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the pyramid is \\boxed{65} cubic units.\n</think>\n\nTo find the volume of the pyramid, we use the formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh \\), where \\( B \\) is the area of the base and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\n- The base area \\( B = 30 \\) square units\n- The height \\( h = 6.5 \\) units\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 \\times 6.5\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 30 \\times 6.5 \\):\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 6.5 = 195\n\\]\n\nThen, divide by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{195}{3} = 65\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the pyramid is \\(\\boxed{65}\\) cubic units.", "answer": "65"}

I need to figure out how many terms in an arithmetic sequence are between 200 and 500, inclusive. The first term is 200, and the eighth term is 500. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference, right? So maybe I can find the common difference first, then figure out how many terms are in that range. Let me start by recalling the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. \n\nThe formula is: \\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\), where \\( a_n \\) is the nth term, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, \\( d \\) is the common difference, and \\( n \\) is the term number. \n\nGiven that the first term \\( a_1 \\) is 200, and the eighth term \\( a_8 \\) is 500. Let me plug those into the formula. \n\nFor the eighth term: \\( a_8 = 200 + (8 - 1)d = 500 \\). So, \\( 200 + 7d = 500 \\). Let me solve for \\( d \\). \n\nSubtract 200 from both sides: \\( 7d = 300 \\). Then divide by 7: \\( d = 300 / 7 \\). Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 7 is approximately 42.857. But since we're dealing with an arithmetic sequence, the common difference should be a whole number if the terms are integers. Wait, the problem doesn't specify that the terms have to be integers, but maybe they do? The problem says \"nastya\" and \"nastya\" in the original problem might be a typo or something, but in the translation, it's \"nastya\" in the first and \"nastya\" in the second. Maybe it's supposed to be \"nastya\" in both? But the problem is in Russian, and the translation might have some issues. However, the problem is asking for the number of terms between 200 and 500, inclusive. So maybe the terms can be non-integers? Hmm, but arithmetic sequences can have non-integer terms.

Let me keep it as a fraction for exactness. So \\( d = 300/7 \\). \n\nNow, I need to find how many terms are between 200 and 500, inclusive. So the first term is 200, which is the first term. The eighth term is 500, which is the eighth term. So the terms in between would be the second through the seventh terms. Wait, but let me check. If the first term is 200, then the second term is 200 + d, the third is 200 + 2d, and so on, up to the eighth term. So the terms are 200, 200 + d, 200 + 2d, ..., 200 + 7d. So the eighth term is 200 + 7d. Since 200 + 7d = 500, which is given. So the terms are 200, 200 + d, 200 + 2d, ..., 200 + 7d. So the terms from the second to the seventh term. That's 6 terms.

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, let me write down the fraction properly. The problem says 21 over 2 squared times 5 to the seventh power. So, that's 21/(2²·5⁷). \n\nI remember that when converting fractions to decimals, especially those with denominators that are products of primes, it's often helpful to simplify the fraction first. Let me check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors. \n\nThe numerator is 21, which factors into 3 × 7. The denominator is 2²·5⁷. Let me see if any of these factors can be canceled out. \n\nLooking at the denominator: 2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125. The numerator is 21, which is 3 × 7. So, the denominator has factors of 2 and 5, but the numerator only has 3 and 7. Therefore, there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form. \n\nTherefore, I need to compute 21 divided by (2²·5⁷). Let me compute the denominator first. \n\n2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125. Multiplying those together: 4 × 78125. Let me calculate that. \n\n4 × 78125. Hmm, 78125 × 4. Let's do 78125 × 4. \n\n78125 × 4: \n\n70000 × 4 = 280000\n\n8000 × 4 = 32000\n\n100 × 4 = 400\n\n25 × 4 = 100\n\nAdding those up: 280000 + 32000 = 312000 + 400 = 312400 + 100 = 312500. \n\nSo, 4 × 78125 = 312500. \n\nTherefore, the denominator is 312500. \n\nSo, the fraction is 21/312500. \n\nNow, converting this to a decimal. Since the denominator is 312500, which is a power of 10? Wait, 312500 is 3.125 × 10⁵. Let me check: 312500 divided by 100000 is 3.125. So, 312500 = 3.125 × 10⁵. \n\nTherefore, 21 divided by 312500 is the same as 21 divided by 3.125 × 10⁵. \n\nBut dividing by 10⁵ is the same as multiplying by 10⁻⁵. So, 21 × 10⁻⁵. \n\n21 × 10⁻⁵ is 0.00021. \n\nWait, let me verify that. \n\n21 divided by 100000 is 0.00021.

The problem is asking how many divisors of 100 are also divisors of 150. Hmm, so I need to find all the numbers that divide both 100 and 150. That sounds like finding the common divisors of 100 and 150. \n\nFirst, I remember that the common divisors of two numbers are the divisors of their greatest common divisor (GCD). So maybe I can find the GCD of 100 and 150 first, and then list all the divisors of that GCD. That should give me the answer. Let me try that approach.\n\nTo find the GCD of 100 and 150, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's start by dividing the larger number by the smaller one. 150 divided by 100 is 1 with a remainder of 50. Then, take 100 and divide by the remainder 50. 100 divided by 50 is 2 with no remainder. So the GCD is 50. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 150 divided by 100 is 1 with a remainder of 50. Then 100 divided by 50 is 2 with no remainder. So yes, the GCD is 50. That seems right. \n\nNow, the next step is to find all the divisors of 50. Let's list them. The divisors of 50 are the numbers that divide 50 without leaving a remainder. Let's see: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. Let me verify each one:\n\n- 1 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 1 = 50.\n- 2 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 2 = 25.\n- 5 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 5 = 10.\n- 10 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 10 = 5.\n- 25 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 25 = 2.\n- 50 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 50 = 1.\n\nSo, the divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. That's six numbers. Therefore, there are six divisors of 100 that are also divisors of 150. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let's verify the GCD of 100 and 150 using another method. \n\nAnother way to find the GCD is by prime factorization. Let's factor both numbers:\n\n100: 100 = 2^2 * 5^2\n\n150: 150 = 2 * 3 * 5^2\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors. So the common primes are 2 and 5. The lowest power of 2 is 2^1, and the lowest power of 5 is 5^2. Therefore, GCD = 2^1 * 5^2 = 2 * 25 = 50. Yep, that's the same result. \n\nSo, the GCD is indeed 50. Therefore, the common divisors are the divisors of 50, which are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. That's six numbers. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by listing all divisors of 100 and 150 and seeing which ones are common. Let's try that as a verification.\n\nDivisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nDivisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nNow, the common divisors are the numbers that appear in both lists. Let's list them:\n\nFrom 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nFrom 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nComparing both lists, the common divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. That's six numbers again. \n\nSo, both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the number of divisors of 100 that are also divisors of 150 is six. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a possibility that I missed some divisors. Let's see. For example, 100 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. 150 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150. So, the common ones are indeed 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let me check again. \n\n150 divided by 100 is 1 with remainder 50. Then 100 divided by 50 is 2 with remainder 0. So yes, GCD is 50. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the number of common divisors. The number of common divisors is equal to the number of divisors of the GCD. Since the GCD is 50, which has 6 divisors, the answer should be 6. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the prime factorization. Let's factor 100 and 150 again. \n\n100: 100 = 10^2 = (2*5)^2 = 2^2 * 5^2. Correct.\n\n150: 150 = 15*10 = (3*5)*(2*5) = 2*3*5^2. Correct. \n\nSo, GCD is 2^1 * 5^2 = 50. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut wait, let me check if 50 is a divisor of both 100 and 150. 50 divides 100 because 100 ÷ 50 = 2. 50 divides 150 because 150 ÷ 50 = 3. So yes, 50 is a common divisor. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me check if there's another common divisor. For example, 10. 10 divides 100 (100 ÷ 10 = 10) and 150 (150 ÷ 10 = 15). So 10 is a common divisor. Similarly, 25. 100 ÷ 25 = 4, 150 ÷ 25 = 6. So 25 is a common divisor. \n\nSo, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. That's six numbers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me check if there's a different approach. Maybe using the formula for the number of common divisors. The number of common divisors is equal to the number of divisors of the GCD. Since the GCD is 50, which has 6 divisors, the answer is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of common divisors, which is the same as the number of divisors of the GCD. So, 6. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let's take another approach. \n\nSuppose we list all divisors of 100 and 150 and see which ones are common. \n\nDivisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nDivisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nCommon divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. \n\nSo, six numbers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nI think that's correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of divisors of 100 that are also divisors of 150 is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of divisors of 100 that are also divisors of 150, we start by determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150. \n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n- \\(150 \\div 100 = 1\\) with a remainder of 50.\n- \\(100 \\div 50 = 2\\) with a remainder of 0.\n\nThus, the GCD of 100 and 150 is 50.\n\nNext, we find the divisors of 50. The prime factorization of 50 is \\(2^1 \\times 5^2\\). The divisors are determined by taking all combinations of the prime factors:\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 = 10\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 = 50\\)\n\nThese divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. \n\nWe verify by listing all divisors of 100 and 150 and finding the common ones:\n- Divisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100\n- Divisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150\n\nThe common divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. \n\nThus, the number of divisors of 100 that are also divisors of 150 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).", "answer": "3"}

The problem is about finding the smallest integer n greater than 1 such that 2^{24} divides n^2. Hmm, so we need n^2 to be a multiple of 2^{24}, right? That means n^2 must have at least 24 factors of 2 in its prime factorization. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you square a number, the exponents in its prime factorization get doubled. So if n has a prime factorization of 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * ..., then n^2 would be 2^{2a} * 3^{2b} * 5^{2c} * ... So the exponents in n^2 are all even numbers. \n\nSince we need 2^{24} to divide n^2, that means the exponent of 2 in n^2 must be at least 24.

The problem is about determining how many fish Hillary has based on the information about her kov acutees and the total amount of money she made. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says she had 10 kov acutees, and each kov acute is worth 75 centavos. So, the total money she made from the kov acutees would be 10 multiplied by 75. Let me calculate that. \n\n10 times 75 is... 10*70 is 700, and 10*5 is 50, so adding those together gives 750. So, she made 750 centavos from the kov acutees. \n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that she had 10 kov acutees, but the question is about the number of fish she had. So, how does the number of fish relate to the money she made? \n\nI need to figure out the value of each fish. The problem doesn't mention the value of the fish, so maybe I need to find it out from the information given. Let me read the problem again. \n\n\"Skupi se kovacev v限 75 centov. Coliko pet workes?

They told me that \\( a = 4 \\), and I need to find \\( b \\). Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if a point lies on a line, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the line. So, substituting \\( x = a \\) and \\( y = b \\) into the equation should work. Since \\( a = 4 \\), I can plug that in first. Let me write that down:\n\n\\( 3(4) + 2b = 12 \\)\n\nOkay, now I just need to solve for \\( b \\). Let's compute the left side step by step. Multiplying 3 by 4 gives 12. So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 12 + 2b = 12 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( b \\):\n\n\\( 2b = 12 - 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 2b = 0 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( b = 0 \\)\n\nWait, so the value of \\( b \\) is 0? Let me check if that makes sense. If the point is (4, 0), plugging into the original equation:\n\n\\( 3(4) + 2(0) = 12 + 0 = 12 \\), which matches the right side. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 12\n\nSubstituting x = 4:\n\n3*4 + 2y = 12\n\n12 + 2y = 12\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n2y = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\ny = 0\n\nYes, that's right. So, the value of \\( b \\) is indeed 0. I think that's the answer. Let me just visualize the line to make sure. The line 3x + 2y = 12. If I plot this, when x is 0, y is 6 (since 3*0 + 2y = 12 => 2y = 12 => y = 6). When y is 0, x is 4 (since 3x + 0 = 12 => x = 4). So, the line passes through (0,6) and (4,0). Therefore, the point (4,0) is on the line, which confirms that b is 0. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The key was substituting the given x-value into the equation and solving for y. It's straightforward once you set up the equation correctly. I think that's all there is to it. So, the answer should be \\( b = 0 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\) for the point \\( (a, b) \\) that lies on the line given by the equation \\( 3x + 2y = 12 \\), we substitute \\( x = a \\) and \\( y = b \\) into the equation. Given \\( a = 4 \\), we substitute \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n3(4) + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n12 + 2b = 12\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2b = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nb = 0\n\\]\n\nTo verify, substituting \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n3(4) + 2(0) = 12 + 0 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the point \\( (4, 0) \\) lies on the line.

{"original_question": "Kateri je najmanjši pozitivni večkratnik števila 450, katerega števke so vse ničle in enice?", "question": "Kateri je najmanjši pozitivni večkratnik števila 450, katerega števke so vse ničle in enice?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest multiple of 450 that has exactly one digit '0' and one digit '1'. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, multiples of 450. Since 450 is 45 times 10, which is 9 times 50. So, multiples of 450 are numbers like 450, 900, 1350, 1800, 2250, 2700, 3150, 3600, 4050, 4500, 4950, 5400, 5850, 6300, 6750, 7200, 7650, 8100, 8550, 9000, 9450, 9900, and so on. Each of these numbers is divisible by 450, right? \n\nNow, the problem states that the number must have exactly one '0' and one '1'. So, the number has to be a multiple of 450, and when written out, it should have one zero and one one. Let's think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let's note that 450 is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2. So, any multiple of 450 will have factors of 2, 3, and 5. But since we need exactly one '0' and one '1', the number must be a multiple of 450, and when written in decimal form, it has one zero and one one. \n\nLet me consider the structure of such a number. Since it's a multiple of 450, it must end with at least two zeros. Wait, but if it ends with two zeros, then it's divisible by 100, which is 4 * 25. But 450 is 45 * 10, so 450 is 45 * 10, which is 45 * 2 * 5. So, 450 is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2. Therefore, any multiple of 450 will have at least two factors of 5 and two factors of 3. But since we need exactly one '0' and one '1', the number must have exactly two trailing zeros. Because if it had more than two zeros, it would have more factors of 10, which would mean more factors of 2 and 5, but we only need two zeros. \n\nSo, the number must end with two zeros. Let's denote the number as N = 450 * k, where k is an integer. Then, N must be of the form ...00. So, we need to find the smallest k such that 450 * k has exactly one '0' and one '1'. \n\nBut how do we ensure that? Let's think about the structure of numbers ending with two zeros. For example, 100, 200, 300, ..., 900, 1000, 1100, etc. But 1000 has three zeros, which is more than two. So, the numbers we need are those that end with two zeros, but have exactly one '0' and one '1'. Wait, but if the number ends with two zeros, then it has two trailing zeros. So, the number is divisible by 100. Therefore, it must have at least two zeros. But the problem states exactly one '0' and one '1'. So, the number must have exactly two zeros and one '1', with the rest being other digits. \n\nTherefore, the number is of the form ...00, where there are exactly two zeros and one '1', and the rest are other digits. So, the number is a multiple of 450, has exactly two zeros, and exactly one '1'. \n\nSo, let's try to construct such a number. Let's start with the smallest possible numbers ending with two zeros. The smallest number ending with two zeros is 100, but 100 has two zeros and one '1', but 100 is not a multiple of 450. The next one is 200, which is also not a multiple of 450. 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900. None of these are multiples of 450. \n\nSo, the first number that is a multiple of 450 and ends with two zeros is 450 * 2 = 900. But 900 has two zeros and one '9', which doesn't have a '1'. So, that's not it. \n\nNext, 450 * 3 = 1350. 1350 has two zeros and one '1', but the rest are '3' and '5'. So, that's a candidate. Let's check if 1350 is the smallest such number. \n\nWait, 1350 is 450 * 3. Let's verify: 450 * 3 = 1350. Yes. So, 1350 has two zeros and one '1', and the rest are '3' and '5'. So, that's a valid number. But is it the smallest? \n\nWait, let's check if there's a smaller number. The next multiple of 450 after 450 is 900, which we already saw has two zeros and one '9'. Then 1350 is the next one. So, 1350 is the first one. But wait, let's check if there's a number between 450 and 1350 that is a multiple of 450 and has exactly one '0' and one '1'. \n\nWait, 450 * 2 = 900, which has two zeros and one '9'. 450 * 3 = 1350, which has two zeros and one '1'. 450 * 4 = 1800, which has two zeros and one '8'. 450 * 5 = 2250, which has two zeros and one '2'. 450 * 6 = 2700, which has two zeros and one '7'. 450 * 7 = 3150, which has two zeros and one '3' and '5'. 450 * 8 = 3600, which has two zeros and one '6'. 450 * 9 = 4050, which has two zeros and one '4' and '5'. 450 * 10 = 4500, which has two zeros and one '4' and '5'. 450 * 11 = 4950, which has two zeros and one '4' and '9'. 450 * 12 = 5400, which has two zeros and one '5' and '4'. 450 * 13 = 5850, which has two zeros and one '5' and '8'. 450 * 14 = 6300, which has two zeros and one '6' and '3'. 450 * 15 = 6750, which has two zeros and one '6' and '7'. 450 * 16 = 7200, which has two zeros and one '7' and '2'. 450 * 17 = 7650, which has two zeros and one '7' and '6'. 450 * 18 = 8100, which has two zeros and one '8' and '1'. 450 * 19 = 8550, which has two zeros and one '8' and '5'. 450 * 20 = 9000, which has two zeros and one '9' and '0's. \n\nSo, the numbers we have so far are 900, 1350, 3150, 3600, 4050, 4500, 4950, 5400, 5850, 6300, 6750, 7200, 7650, 8100, 8550, 9000. \n\nLooking at these, the first one with exactly one '0' and one '1' is 1350. Then 3150 has two zeros and one '1', but the rest are '3' and '5'. Then 3600 has two zeros and one '3', but the rest are '6' and '0's. Then 4050 has two zeros and one '4', but the rest are '0' and '5's. Then 4500 has two zeros and one '4', but the rest are '5' and '0's. Then 4950 has two zeros and one '4', but the rest are '9' and '5's. Then 5400 has two zeros and one '5', but the rest are '4' and '0's. Then 5850 has two zeros and one '5', but the rest are '8' and '5's. Then 6300 has two zeros and one '6', but the rest are '3' and '0's. Then 6750 has two zeros and one '6', but the rest are '7' and '5's. Then 7200 has two zeros and one '7', but the rest are '2' and '0's. Then 7650 has two zeros and one '7', but the rest are '6' and '5's. Then 8100 has two zeros and one '8', but the rest are '1' and '0's. Then 8550 has two zeros and one '8', but the rest are '5' and '5's. Then 9000 has two zeros and one '9', but the rest are '0's. \n\nSo, the first number that meets the criteria is 1350. But wait, let's check if there's a smaller number. Wait, 1350 is 450 * 3. But 450 * 2 = 900, which has two zeros and one '9', which doesn't have a '1'. So, 1350 is the first one. But let's check if there's a number between 450 and 1350 that is a multiple of 450 and has exactly one '0' and one '1'. \n\nWait, 450 * 3 = 1350. 450 * 4 = 1800. 450 * 5 = 2250. 450 * 6 = 2700. 450 * 7 = 3150. 450 * 8 = 3600. 450 * 9 = 4050. 450 * 10 = 4500. 450 * 11 = 4950. 450 * 12 = 5400. 450 * 13 = 5850. 450 * 14 = 6300. 450 * 15 = 6750. 450 * 16 = 7200. 450 * 17 = 7650. 450 * 18 = 8100. 450 * 19 = 8550. 450 * 20 = 9000. \n\nSo, the numbers between 450 and 1350 are 900, 1350, 3150, 3600, 4050, 4500, 4950, 5400, 5850, 6300, 6750, 7200, 7650, 8100, 8550, 9000. \n\nLooking at these, the first one with exactly one '0' and one '1' is 1350.

Kakšna je verjetnost, da je dama postavljena na osenčen kvadrat šahovnice?", "response": " \nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a square with a table in the center, and there are four columns (A, B, C, D) and four rows (1, 2, 3, 4). Each cell in the table has a number from 1 to 16, arranged in a 4x4 grid. The numbers are such that each row and each column adds up to the same total, which is called a magic square. \n\nNow, there are two special numbers: one in the center of the square (which is the table) and another in the center of each side (the columns). The problem mentions that the two numbers in the center of the square (the table) and the two numbers in the center of each side (the columns) are all different. \n\nWe need to find the sum of the two numbers in the center of the square (the table) and the two numbers in the center of each side (the columns). Then, we have to determine if this sum is a prime number or not. \n\nFirst, let's recall that in a 4x4 magic square, the magic constant (the sum of each row, column, and diagonal) is calculated as follows: the magic constant M is equal to (n(n² + 1))/2, where n is the order of the square. For a 4x4 square, n=4, so M = (4*(16 + 1))/2 = (4*17)/2 = 34. So each row, column, and diagonal should add up to 34. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the two numbers in the center of the square (the table) and the two numbers in the center of each side (the columns) are all different. So, the center cell (the table) has a number, and each of the four side centers (columns) also has a number, all different from each other. \n\nBut in a standard 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Let me check what the center cell is. In a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is the cell at position (2,2) if we index from 1 to 4. The value of the center cell in a standard magic square is 13.5, but since we are dealing with integers, the center cell must be an integer. However, in a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed as 13.5, which is not an integer. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Let me confirm. For a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Let me recall the formula for the center cell. The center cell in a 4x4 magic square is calculated as follows: the magic constant M is 34, so the center cell is M/2 = 17. But in a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Wait, no, actually, in a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Let me check. \n\nWait, actually, in a 4x4 magic square, the center cell is fixed. Let me recall.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write down the fraction clearly: 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8). I need to compute this value and then sum its digits. \n\nStarting with the denominator: 5^7 is 5 multiplied by itself 7 times, and 2^8 is 2 multiplied by itself 8 times. Let me calculate those exponents first. \n\nCalculating 5^7: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125, 3125*5=15625, 15625*5=78125. So 5^7 is 78125. \n\nCalculating 2^8: 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16, 16*2=32, 32*2=64, 64*2=128, 128*2=256. So 2^8 is 256. \n\nTherefore, the denominator is 78125 * 256. Let me compute that product. \n\nMultiplying 78125 by 256. Let's do this step by step. \n\nFirst, 78125 * 200 = 15,625,000. \n\nThen, 78125 * 56 = 78125 * (50 + 6) = 78125*50 + 78125*6. \n\n78125*50: 78125*5=390,625, so 390,625*10=3,906,250. \n\n78125*6: 78125*6=468,750. \n\nAdding those together: 3,906,250 + 468,750 = 4,375,000. \n\nSo total denominator is 15,625,000 + 4,375,000 = 20,000,000. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 78125 * 256. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me verify. \n\nAlternatively, 78125 * 256. Let's do 78125 * 200 = 15,625,000. Then 78125 * 56. \n\n78125 * 50 = 3,906,250. \n\n78125 * 6 = 468,750. \n\nAdding 3,906,250 + 468,750 = 4,375,000. \n\nSo total denominator is 15,625,000 + 4,375,000 = 20,000,000. \n\nWait, that's 20 million. But 78125 * 256. Let me check 78125 * 256. \n\nAlternatively, 78125 * 256. Let's compute 78125 * 200 = 15,625,000. Then 78125 * 56. \n\n78125 * 50 = 3,906,250. \n\n78125 * 6 = 468,750. \n\nAdding 3,906,250 + 468,750 = 4,375,000. \n\nSo total denominator is 15,625,000 + 4,375,000 = 20,000,000. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the denominator is 20,000,000. \n\nTherefore, the fraction is 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nSo 4321 / 20,000,000. Let me write that as a decimal. \n\nTo convert this fraction to a decimal, I can divide 4321 by 20,000,000. \n\nBut 20,000,000 is 20 million. So 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nLet me think about how to do this division. \n\nAlternatively, since 20,000,000 is 20 million, which is 20,000,000. So 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nThis is equivalent to 4321 * 10^{-6}. \n\nSo 4321 * 0.000001. \n\nCalculating 4321 * 0.000001. \n\nMultiplying by 0.000001 is the same as moving the decimal point six places to the left. \n\nSo 4321 becomes 0.004321. \n\nWait, 4321 * 0.000001 = 0.004321. \n\nBut let me verify this. \n\nAlternatively, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nLet me compute 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nDividing 4321 by 20,000,000. \n\nSince 20,000,000 is 20 million, which is 20,000,000. \n\nSo 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nThis is equal to 4321 * (1/20,000,000). \n\nWhich is 4321 * 0.00000005. \n\nBecause 1/20,000,000 = 0.00000005. \n\nSo 4321 * 0.00000005. \n\nMultiplying 4321 by 0.00000005. \n\nWhich is 4321 * 5 * 10^{-8} = 21,605 * 10^{-8} = 0.00000021605. \n\nWait, 4321 * 0.00000005. \n\n4321 * 0.00000005 = 4321 * 5 * 10^{-8} = 21,605 * 10^{-8} = 0.00000021605. \n\nSo the decimal is 0.00000021605. \n\nBut let me check this with another method. \n\nAlternatively, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nLet me write 4321 as 4.321 * 10^3. \n\nSo 4.321 * 10^3 / 20,000,000. \n\nWhich is 4.321 * 10^3 / (2 * 10^7) = (4.321 / 2) * 10^(-4) = 2.1605 * 10^(-4) = 0.00021605. \n\nSo that's 0.00021605. \n\nWait, but 4321 divided by 20,000,000. \n\nAlternatively, 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nLet me compute 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nDividing 4321 by 20,000,000. \n\nSince 20,000,000 is 20 million, which is 20,000,000. \n\nSo 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nThis is equal to 4321 * (1/20,000,000). \n\nWhich is 4321 * 0.00000005. \n\nBecause 1/20,000,000 = 0.00000005. \n\nSo 4321 * 0.00000005. \n\n4321 * 0.00000005. \n\n4321 * 5 = 21,605. \n\n21,605 * 0.00000001 = 0.00021605. \n\nSo 0.00021605. \n\nBut wait, 4321 divided by 20,000,000 is 0.00021605. \n\nBut let me check this with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, 4321 ÷ 20,000,000. \n\nLet me write 4321 as 4.321 * 10^3. \n\nSo 4.321 * 10^3 / 20,000,000. \n\nWhich is 4.321 * 10^3 / (2 * 10^7) = (4.321 / 2) * 10^(-4) = 2.1605 * 10^(-4) = 0.00021605. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the decimal representation is 0.00021605. \n\nBut let me confirm this by actually performing the division. \n\nDividing 4321 by 20,000,000. \n\nLet me do this step by step. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 4321 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 is larger than 4321, so it goes 0 times. \n\nBring down a zero: 43210. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 43210 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 is larger than 43210, so 0 times. \n\nBring down another zero: 432100. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 432100 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 is larger than 432100, so 0 times. \n\nBring down another zero: 4321000. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 4321000 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 is larger than 4321000, so 0 times. \n\nBring down another zero: 43210000. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 43210000 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 * 2 = 40,000,000. \n\n43210000 - 40,000,000 = 3,210,000. \n\nSo 2 times. \n\nSo the first digit after the decimal is 2. \n\nSubtract 40,000,000 from 43,210,000, remainder 3,210,000. \n\nBring down the next zero: 32,100,000. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 32,100,000 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 * 1 = 20,000,000. \n\n32,100,000 - 20,000,000 = 12,100,000. \n\nSo next digit is 1. \n\nSubtract 20,000,000 from 32,100,000, remainder 12,100,000. \n\nBring down the next zero: 121,000,000. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 121,000,000 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 * 6 = 120,000,000. \n\n121,000,000 - 120,000,000 = 1,000,000. \n\nSo next digit is 6. \n\nSubtract 120,000,000 from 121,000,000, remainder 1,000,000. \n\nBring down the next zero: 10,000,000. \n\n20,000,000 goes into 10,000,000 how many times? \n\n20,000,000 * 0.5 = 10,000,000. \n\n1", "answer": "14"}

Hmm, that's a lot of terms. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to simplify this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the angles are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, and each subsequent angle is 20° more. So the sequence is 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. That's 8 terms. Each term is 20° apart, so they are all in the first quadrant where sine is positive. That might be helpful.\n\nI remember that products of sines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas or maybe using complex numbers and roots of unity. Let me think. Maybe there's a way to express each sine term as a complex number on the unit circle and then multiply them together. That might be a good approach.\n\nLet me recall that sinθ = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i). So each sine term can be written as (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i). Then the product of all these terms would be the product of (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i) for each θ from 20° to 160° in steps of 20°.\n\nSo, the product becomes [product_{k=1}^8 (e^(iθ_k) - e^(-iθ_k))] / (2i)^8. But this might not be the most straightforward way, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the angles are symmetric around 90°, maybe there's a symmetry that can be exploited. Let me check the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. If I pair them as (20°, 160°), (40°, 140°), (60°, 120°), (80°, 100°), each pair sums to 180°. So sin20° sin160° = sin20° sin(180° - 20°) = sin20° sin20° = sin²20°, same for the others. So the product becomes [sin²20° sin²40° sin²60° sin²80°]. Hmm, that's a simplification. So the original product is equal to the square of the product of the sines of 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°. That's a big reduction! So instead of dealing with 8 terms, we can work with 4 terms.\n\nSo now the problem reduces to finding [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let's see if there's a way to compute this product. Maybe using product-to-sum formulas.\n\nLet me pair sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°. Let's compute each pair.\n\nFirst, sin20° sin80°. Using the identity sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.\n\nSo sin20° sin80° = [cos(60°) - cos(100°)] / 2.\n\nSimilarly, sin40° sin60° = [cos(20°) - cos(100°)] / 2.\n\nSo the product becomes [ (cos60° - cos100°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° - cos100°)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute cos60°, which is 0.5.\n\ncos100° is cos(180° - 80°) = -cos80°. So cos100° = -cos80°.\n\nSimilarly, cos20° is just cos20°.\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\nFirst term: (0.5 - (-cos80°))/2 = (0.5 + cos80°)/2.\n\nSecond term: (cos20° - (-cos80°))/2 = (cos20° + cos80°)/2.\n\nSo the product becomes [ (0.5 + cos80°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° + cos80°)/2 ].\n\nMultiply these two terms:\n\n= [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.\n\nLet me expand the numerator:\n\n= [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos²80°] / 4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos²80°] / 4.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to compute this product. Alternatively, perhaps using product-to-sum identities on the original product.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let me denote this as P. Then, as we saw earlier, P = [sin²20° sin²40° sin²60° sin²80°]^2. Wait, but maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the identity for the product of sines. There's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. For example, the product sin(a) sin(a + d) sin(a + 2d)... sin(a + (n-1)d) can be expressed in terms of n and d. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use complex numbers. Let me consider the product of the sines as the imaginary part of a complex number. For example, sinθ = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i). So the product of sines can be written as the imaginary part of the product of (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i). But this might be too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let me note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are angles that are 20° apart. Maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me see if I can pair them differently.\n\nAlternatively, note that 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are angles that are 20° apart, and 100°, 120°, 140°, 160° are their complements. So maybe there's a relationship between these angles.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let me compute this product numerically to see if it's a known value. But since this is a competition-style problem, maybe the answer is a nice number like 1/16 or something. Let me try to compute it.\n\nFirst, compute sin20° ≈ 0.3420, sin40° ≈ 0.6428, sin60° ≈ 0.8660, sin80° ≈ 0.9848.\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2195\n\n0.2195 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1893\n\n0.1893 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1857\n\nSo approximately 0.1857. Then square that: 0.1857² ≈ 0.0345. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe the exact value is 1/16? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can be used here. Let me recall that sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = (sin20° sin80°)(sin40° sin60°). Then, using the identity sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.\n\nSo sin20° sin80° = [cos60° - cos100°]/2. Similarly, sin40° sin60° = [cos20° - cos100°]/2.\n\nTherefore, the product becomes [ (cos60° - cos100°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° - cos100°)/2 ].\n\nWhich is [ (0.5 - cos100°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° - cos100°)/2 ].\n\nBut cos100° is cos(180° - 80°) = -cos80°, so cos100° = -cos80°. Therefore, substituting:\n\n= [ (0.5 - (-cos80°))/2 ] * [ (cos20° - (-cos80°))/2 ]\n\n= [ (0.5 + cos80°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° + cos80°)/2 ]\n\nMultiply these two terms:\n\n= [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n= [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos²80°] / 4\n\nAgain, this seems complicated.

The problem is about converting a coordinate system from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates. The given equation is z = c, which is in cylindrical coordinates. The question is asking which of the options (A) through (E) best describes the shape when this equation is converted to Cartesian coordinates. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates. In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as (r, θ, z), where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, θ is the angle in the xy-plane from the positive x-axis, and z is the height above the xy-plane. In Cartesian coordinates, the same point is represented as (x, y, z), where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and z remains the same. \n\nGiven the equation z = c in cylindrical coordinates, I need to convert this to Cartesian coordinates. Since z is the same in both systems, the equation z = c in Cartesian coordinates would just be z = c. But wait, in Cartesian coordinates, z is the vertical coordinate. So, if z is constant, that would be a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane. \n\nBut let me verify this. Let's take a point in cylindrical coordinates where z = c. For example, if r = 1, θ = 0, then x = 1*cos 0 = 1, y = 1*sin 0 = 0, so the point is (1, 0, c). If I convert this to Cartesian coordinates, it's (1, 0, c). Similarly, if r = 2, θ = π/2, then x = 2*cos(π/2) = 0, y = 2*sin(π/2) = 2, so the point is (0, 2, c). So, in Cartesian coordinates, the equation z = c is a plane where all points have z-coordinate c, regardless of x and y. \n\nTherefore, the shape described by z = c in Cartesian coordinates is a plane parallel to the xy-plane. So, the answer should be (E) Valj, which is a plane. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are (A) Premica, (B) Krog, (C) R Kristina, (D) Krotla, (E) Valj. So, (E) Valj is a plane. That seems correct. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some vector properties. \n\nFirst, the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. That is, |a × b| = |a||b|sinθ. In this case, |a| is 2, |b| is 7, and |a × b| is the magnitude of the given cross product vector. Let me compute that first.\n\nThe cross product vector is (3, 2, 6). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let's calculate that. 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 = 13, 13 + 36 = 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49) = 7. \n\nSo, |a × b| = 7. According to the formula, that should equal |a||b|sinθ. Plugging in the known values: 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Let's solve for sinθ. \n\nDivide both sides by 14: sinθ = 7 / 14 = 0.5. So sinθ = 0.5. Therefore, θ is either 30 degrees or 150 degrees, since sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants. \n\nBut the question asks for the smallest possible angle between a and b. Since angles between vectors are typically measured as the smallest angle between them, which is between 0 and 180 degrees. So 30 degrees is smaller than 150 degrees. Therefore, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The cross product magnitude is 7, which is equal to |a||b|sinθ. So 7 = 2*7*sinθ => sinθ = 0.5. So θ = 30° or 150°. Since we need the smallest angle, 30° is the answer. \n\nBut let me think again. The cross product's direction is perpendicular to both a and b. The magnitude is 7, which is the same as the product of the magnitudes of a and b times sinθ. So sinθ = 0.5, so θ = 30° or 150°. Since the cross product is given as (3,2,6), which is a vector in 3D space, the angle between a and b is determined by the sine of the angle. The cross product's direction depends on the orientation of the vectors, but the magnitude is fixed. \n\nTherefore, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. So the answer should be 30 degrees, which in boxed form is \\boxed{30^\\circ}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest possible angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\boxed{30^\\circ}.\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = 2\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = 7\\), and their cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin \\theta\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\sin \\theta\n\\]\nSolving for \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{7}{14} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) whose sine is 0.5 is \\(30^\\circ\\) or \\(150^\\circ\\).

I need to find the number of zeros of the function g(x) = f(x + 5), where f(x) is given as x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, zeros of a function are the x-values where the function equals zero. So, I need to solve g(x) = 0, which is f(x + 5) = 0. \n\nFirst, let me recall that if I have a function f(x) and I shift it to the left by 5 units, the zeros of the shifted function will be 5 units to the left of the original zeros. So, if f(x) has some zeros at x = a, b, c, then g(x) = f(x + 5) will have zeros at x = a - 5, b - 5, c - 5. That makes sense because shifting the graph left by 5 units moves each x-intercept 5 units to the left. \n\nTherefore, the number of zeros of g(x) should be the same as the number of zeros of f(x). So, I just need to find how many real roots f(x) has. But wait, the problem says \"naj bo f function\" and \"naj bo g function,\" so maybe they are referring to the number of zeros? But the problem says \"nastite vs tobi nultice\" which is in Catalan, but the translation is \"Find the number of zeros of the function g(x).\" So, the question is to find the number of zeros of g(x), which is the same as the number of zeros of f(x + 5). \n\nBut how do I find the number of zeros of f(x)? Let me think. The function f(x) is a cubic polynomial, so it can have up to three real roots. But depending on the coefficients, it might have one, two, or three real roots. To determine the number of real roots, I can analyze the behavior of the function, such as its critical points and end behavior. \n\nFirst, let's note that f(x) is a cubic polynomial, so it tends to +infinity as x approaches +infinity and to -infinity as x approaches -infinity. Therefore, it must cross the x-axis at least once. But since it's a cubic, it can have up to three real roots. However, depending on the coefficients, it might have one or three real roots. \n\nTo find the number of real roots, I can use the derivative to find the critical points. The critical points occur where the derivative is zero. Let's compute the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623\n\nNow, to find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x² - 98x + 623 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. Let's compute the discriminant to see how many real roots it has. The discriminant D is given by D = b² - 4ac, where a = 3, b = -98, c = 623.\n\nD = (-98)² - 4*3*623\n\nCalculate that:\n\n(-98)² = 9604\n\n4*3*623 = 12*623 = 7476\n\nSo, D = 9604 - 7476 = 2128\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (2128 > 0), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. Therefore, the original cubic function f(x) has two critical points (local maximum and local minimum). \n\nNow, to determine the number of real roots, we need to check the values of f(x) at these critical points. If the function crosses the x-axis between the critical points and at the ends, then it will have three real roots. If it doesn't cross between the critical points, then it might have one or three real roots. \n\nLet me compute the critical points first. The quadratic equation is 3x² - 98x + 623 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [98 ± sqrt(2128)] / (2*3)\n\nsqrt(2128) is approximately sqrt(2128). Let me compute that. 46² = 2116, 47² = 2209. So sqrt(2128) is between 46 and 47. Let's compute more accurately.\n\n46.1² = 46² + 2*46*0.1 + 0.1² = 2116 + 9.2 + 0.01 = 2125.21\n\n46.2² = 2125.21 + 2*46*0.2 + 0.2² = 2125.21 + 18.4 + 0.04 = 2143.65\n\nSo sqrt(2128) is between 46.1 and 46.2. Let's approximate it more precisely.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let f(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623. We know f(46.1) = 2125.21, f(46.2) = 2143.65. The difference between f(46.2) and f(46.1) is 2143.65 - 2125.21 = 18.44. The difference in x is 0.1. So the derivative at x = 46.1 is approximately 18.44 / 0.1 = 184.4. But wait, the derivative is 3x² - 98x + 623. Wait, no, the derivative is f'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623. Wait, but we already computed the critical points by solving f'(x) = 0. Wait, no, the critical points are the solutions to f'(x) = 0, which we already did. Wait, maybe I confused the derivative here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the critical points are the solutions to f'(x) = 0, which we found to be two real roots. Let me denote them as x₁ and x₂. Then, the function f(x) has a local maximum at x₁ and a local minimum at x₂. To determine the number of real roots, we need to evaluate f(x) at these critical points and at the limits as x approaches ±∞.\n\nSince f(x) tends to +∞ as x approaches +∞ and -∞ as x approaches -∞, the function will cross the x-axis at least once. The number of real roots depends on whether the local maximum is above the x-axis and the local minimum is below the x-axis, or vice versa. If the local maximum is above and the local minimum is below, then the function crosses the x-axis three times. If the local maximum is below or the local minimum is above, then it might cross only once or three times. \n\nBut to be precise, we need to compute f(x₁) and f(x₂). Let's compute f(x) at the critical points. Let's denote x₁ and x₂ as the roots of 3x² - 98x + 623 = 0. Let's compute f(x₁) and f(x₂).\n\nFirst, let's compute f(x₁). Since x₁ is a root of f'(x) = 0, which is 3x² - 98x + 623 = 0. Therefore, 3x₁² - 98x₁ + 623 = 0. So, 3x₁² = 98x₁ - 623. \n\nNow, let's compute f(x₁):\n\nf(x₁) = x₁³ - 49x₁² + 623x₁ - 2015\n\nWe can express x₁³ in terms of x₁². Since 3x₁² = 98x₁ - 623, then x₁³ = x₁ * 3x₁² = x₁*(98x₁ - 623) = 98x₁² - 623x₁\n\nSubstitute this into f(x₁):\n\nf(x₁) = (98x₁² - 623x₁) - 49x₁² + 623x₁ - 2015\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n98x₁² - 49x₁² = 49x₁²\n\n-623x₁ + 623x₁ = 0\n\nSo, f(x₁) = 49x₁² - 2015\n\nSimilarly, compute f(x₂):\n\nf(x₂) = x₂³ - 49x₂² + 623x₂ - 2015\n\nAgain, express x₂³ in terms of x₂². Since 3x₂² = 98x₂ - 623, then x₂³ = x₂*(98x₂ - 623) = 98x₂² - 623x₂\n\nSubstitute into f(x₂):\n\nf(x₂) = (98x₂² - 623x₂) - 49x₂² + 623x₂ - 2015\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n98x₂² - 49x₂² = 49x₂²\n\n-623x₂ + 623x₂ = 0\n\nSo, f(x₂) = 49x₂² - 2015\n\nTherefore, both f(x₁) and f(x₂) are equal to 49x₁² - 2015 and 49x₂² - 2015, respectively. \n\nNow, we need to compute x₁² and x₂². Let's recall that x₁ and x₂ are roots of 3x² - 98x + 623 = 0. Therefore, for each root, 3x² = 98x - 623. \n\nLet's compute x₁². Since 3x₁² = 98x₁ - 623, then x₁² = (98x₁ - 623)/3\n\nSimilarly, x₂² = (98x₂ - 623)/3\n\nTherefore, 49x₁² = 49*(98x₁ - 623)/3 = (49*98x₁ - 49*623)/3\n\nSimilarly, 49x₂² = 49*(98x₂ - 623)/3 = (49*98x₂ - 49*623)/3\n\nBut 49*98 = 49*98 = 4802\n\nSo, 49x₁² = (4802x₁ - 49*623)/3\n\nSimilarly, 49x₂² = (4802x₂ - 49*623)/3\n\nTherefore, f(x₁) = 49x₁² - 2015 = [4802x₁ - 49*623]/3 - 2015\n\nSimilarly, f(x₂) = [4802x₂ - 49*623]/3 - 2015\n\nLet me compute 49*623. Let's calculate that:\n\n49*600 = 29,400\n\n49*23 = 1,127\n\nSo, 49*623 = 29,400 + 1,127 = 30,527\n\nTherefore, f(x₁) = [4802x₁ - 30,527]/3 - 2015\n\nSimilarly, f(x₂) = [4802x₂ - 30,527]/3 - 2015\n\nLet me compute 2015 in terms of thirds. 2015 = 2015*3/3 = 6045/3\n\nTherefore, f(x₁) = [4802x₁ - 30,527 - 6045]/3 = [4802x₁ - 36,572]/3\n\nSimilarly, f(x₂) = [4802x₂ - 30,527 - 6045]/3 = [4802x₂ - 36,572]/3\n\nSo, f(x₁) = (4802x₁ - 36,572)/3 and f(x₂) = (4802x₂ - 36,572)/3\n\nNow, we need to compute x₁ and x₂. Since x₁ and x₂ are roots of 3x² - 98x + 623 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [98 ± sqrt(2128)] / 6\n\nBut sqrt(2128) is approximately 46.12, as we saw earlier. So, x₁ = [98 + 46.12]/6 ≈ 144.12/6 ≈ 24.02\n\nx₂ = [98 - 46.12]/6 ≈ 51.88/6 ≈ 8.647\n\nSo, x₁ ≈ 24.02 and x₂ ≈ 8.647\n\nTherefore, f(x₁) = (4802*24.02 - 36,572)/3\n\nCompute 4802*24.02:\n\nFirst, 4802*24 = 115,248\n\nThen, 4802*0.02 = 96.04\n\nSo, total is 115,248 + 96.04 = 115,344.04\n\nThen, subtract 36,572: 115,344.04 - 36,572 = 78,772.04\n\nDivide by 3: 78,772.04 / 3 ≈ 26,257.3467\n\nSimilarly, f(x₂) = (4802*", "answer": "34"}

That might be useful here. \n\nSo, applying that identity to each term:\n\n1. For the first term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 10^\\circ} = 1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ\\)\n2. For the second term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 20^\\circ} = 1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ\\), since \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta} = \\csc^2 \\theta = 1 + \\cot^2 \\theta\\)\n3. For the third term: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 40^\\circ} = 1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\\)\n\nSo, substituting these into the original expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ) + (1 + \\cot^2 20^\\circ) + (1 + \\cot^2 40^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we can combine the constants and the trigonometric terms:\n\n\\[\n1 + 1 + 1 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the value of \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\\), and then adding 3 to that result. \n\nHmm, how do I compute \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ + \\cot^2 20^\\circ + \\cot^2 40^\\circ\\)?

These are all multiples of 10°, and they add up to 70°, which is 180° - 110°, but not sure if that helps.

Let me try to compute each term numerically. \n\nFirst, let's compute \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ\\). \n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\tan 10^\\circ \\approx 0.1763269807\\), so \\(\\tan^2 10^\\circ \\approx 0.031086\\). \n\nNext, \\(\\cot^2 20^\\circ\\). \\(\\cot 20^\\circ = \\tan 70^\\circ\\), since \\(\\cot \\theta = \\tan (90^\\circ - \\theta)\\). So, \\(\\cot 20^\\circ = \\tan 70^\\circ\\). \n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\tan 70^\\circ \\approx 2.747477419\\), so \\(\\cot^2 20^\\circ \\approx (2.747477419)^2 \\approx 7.547\\). \n\nThen, \\(\\cot^2 40^\\circ\\). Similarly, \\(\\cot 40^\\circ = \\tan 50^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cot^2 40^\\circ = \\tan^2 50^\\circ\\). \n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\tan 50^\\circ \\approx 1.191753592\\), so \\(\\tan^2 50^\\circ \\approx 1.419\\). \n\nSo, adding these up: \n\n\\[\n0.031086 + 7.547 + 1.419 \\approx 0.031086 + 7.547 = 7.578086 + 1.419 = 9.007086\n\\]\n\nAdding 3 to that gives approximately 12.007086. But this is an approximate value. However, the problem is likely expecting an exact value, not an approximate decimal. So, maybe my approximate calculation is not precise enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express this sum in terms of known trigonometric identities. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps using the identity for \\(\\tan^2 \\theta + \\cot^2 \\theta\\). Let me recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\theta + \\cot^2 \\theta = \\sec^2 \\theta + \\csc^2 \\theta - 2\n\\]\n\nBut I don't know if that helps here.

The problem is about finding the number of convex polygons with n sides where the sum of the exterior angles not adjacent to each other is 1070 degrees. Hmm, I need to recall some properties of convex polygons and their exterior angles. \n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the exterior angles of any convex polygon is always 360 degrees, right? Because no matter how many sides the polygon has, the total turning you make when walking around the polygon is a full circle. So, that's a key point. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the sum of the exterior angles not adjacent to each other is 1070 degrees.\" Hmm, maybe I need to clarify what \"not adjacent\" means here. If the polygon is convex, then each exterior angle is adjacent to two others. So, if I take the exterior angles not adjacent to each other, that would mean skipping one angle each time. For example, in a triangle, the exterior angles are 120 degrees each, and if you skip one, you get 60 degrees each. But maybe in a quadrilateral, the exterior angles are 90 degrees each, and if you skip one, you get 180 degrees each? Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all exterior angles is 360. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is referring to the sum of the exterior angles that are not adjacent to each other. For example, in a quadrilateral, if you take the exterior angles not adjacent to each other, that would be two angles. But in a quadrilateral, the sum of all exterior angles is 360.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an inverse modulo is. If I have a number a, its inverse modulo m is a number b such that a*b ≡ 1 mod m. So in this case, t + 2 should be the inverse of t modulo 23. That means:\n\n(t + 2) * t ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nSo, the equation we need to solve is:\n\nt(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nt² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nThen, rearranging terms:\n\nt² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23\n\nSo, we need to find an integer t between 1 and 22 (since 0 and 23 are excluded) such that t² + 2t - 1 is divisible by 23.\n\nThis is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, maybe I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula for ax² + bx + c ≡ 0 mod p is x ≡ [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a) mod p, provided that the discriminant is a quadratic residue modulo p.\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 2, c = -1. So the discriminant D is:\n\nD = b² - 4ac = 2² - 4*1*(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, D = 8. Now, we need to check if 8 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. If it is, then we can find the square roots of 8 modulo 23, and then use those to find t.\n\nFirst, let's check if 8 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. To do this, we can use Euler's criterion. Euler's criterion states that a is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if a^{(p-1)/2} ≡ 1 mod p. Since 23 is prime, (23-1)/2 = 11. So we need to compute 8^{11} mod 23.\n\nCalculating 8^{11} mod 23 can be done using exponentiation by squaring.\n\nFirst, compute 8^1 = 8\n\n8^2 = 64 ≡ 64 - 2*23 = 64 - 46 = 18 mod 23\n\n8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 18^2 = 324 ≡ 324 - 14*23 = 324 - 322 = 2 mod 23\n\n8^8 = (8^4)^2 = 2^2 = 4 mod 23\n\nNow, 8^11 = 8^8 * 8^2 * 8^1 ≡ 4 * 18 * 8 mod 23\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n4 * 18 = 72 ≡ 72 - 3*23 = 72 - 69 = 3 mod 23\n\n3 * 8 = 24 ≡ 24 - 23 = 1 mod 23\n\nSo, 8^{11} ≡ 1 mod 23. Therefore, 8 is a quadratic residue modulo 23, which means that the equation t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23 has solutions.\n\nNow, using the quadratic formula, the solutions are:\n\nt ≡ [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2 mod 23\n\nBut since we are working modulo 23, and 2 is invertible (since 2 and 23 are coprime), we can compute the inverse of 2 modulo 23. The inverse of 2 mod 23 is 12, because 2*12 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\nt ≡ [ -2 ± sqrt(8) ] * 12 mod 23\n\nBut we need to compute sqrt(8) mod 23. Since 8 is a quadratic residue, there exists an integer x such that x² ≡ 8 mod 23. Let's find such an x.\n\nWe can try squaring numbers from 1 to 11 (since 12² is 144 ≡ 144 - 6*23 = 144 - 138 = 6 mod 23, so 12² ≡ 6 mod 23. Then 11² = (12 - 1)² = 12² - 2*12 + 1 = 6 - 24 + 1 = -17 ≡ 6 mod 23. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe 10² = 100 ≡ 100 - 4*23 = 100 - 92 = 8 mod 23. So 10² ≡ 8 mod 23. Therefore, sqrt(8) ≡ 10 mod 23.\n\nAlternatively, 13² = (10 + 3)² = 100 + 60 + 9 = 169 ≡ 169 - 7*23 = 169 - 161 = 8 mod 23. So 13² ≡ 8 mod 23. Therefore, sqrt(8) ≡ 13 mod 23. Similarly, 13 is the positive square root. The negative square root would be -13 ≡ 10 mod 23. So sqrt(8) ≡ 10 or 13 mod 23.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the quadratic formula:\n\nt ≡ [ -2 ± 10 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nOr\n\nt ≡ [ -2 ± 13 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nLet's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, with sqrt(8) = 10:\n\nt ≡ [ -2 + 10 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nt ≡ 8 * 12 mod 23\n\n8*12 = 96. 96 mod 23: 23*4 = 92, 96 - 92 = 4. So t ≡ 4 mod 23.\n\nSecond, with sqrt(8) = 13:\n\nt ≡ [ -2 + 13 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nt ≡ 11 * 12 mod 23\n\n11*12 = 132. 132 mod 23: 23*5 = 115, 132 - 115 = 17. So t ≡ 17 mod 23.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the negative square root:\n\nt ≡ [ -2 - 10 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nt ≡ (-12) * 12 mod 23\n\n-12 mod 23 is 11, so 11*12 = 132 ≡ 17 mod 23.\n\nSimilarly, t ≡ [ -2 - 13 ] * 12 mod 23\n\nt ≡ (-15) * 12 mod 23\n\n-15 mod 23 is 8, so 8*12 = 96 ≡ 4 mod 23.\n\nSo the solutions are t ≡ 4 or 17 mod 23. Since t must be between 1 and 22, the possible values are 4 and 17.\n\nWait, but let me check if these are correct. Let's verify t = 4 first.\n\nCompute t + 2 = 6. Then, check if 6 is the inverse of 4 modulo 23.\n\nCompute 4 * 6 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that works. So t = 4 is a solution.\n\nNow check t = 17.\n\nt + 2 = 19. Check if 19 is the inverse of 17 modulo 23.\n\nCompute 17 * 19 = 323. 323 divided by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. So 17*19 ≡ 1 mod 23. Correct. So t = 17 is also a solution.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of t are 4 and 17. But the problem says \"find\" one, so maybe both are acceptable? Wait, the problem says \"find\" and doesn't specify if there are multiple solutions. But in the original problem statement, it's written as \"Poiščite edostveno t, take t + 2 be inverz t modulo 23. So there are two solutions. But maybe the problem expects both? Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Poiščite edostveno t, take t + 2 be inverz t modulo 23. So t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23. So we need to find t such that (t + 2) * t ≡ 1 mod 23. So the equation is t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So the solutions are t = 4 and t = 17. So both are valid. But maybe the problem expects both answers? Wait, the original problem is in Russian, and sometimes problems like this might have multiple answers. But in the translation, it's \"find\" one. Maybe in the original problem, there's only one solution? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Poiščite edostveno t, take t + 2 be inverz t modulo 23. So t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23. So we need to find t such that (t + 2) * t ≡ 1 mod 23. So the equation is t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So the solutions are t = 4 and t = 17. So both are valid. Therefore, the answer is both 4 and 17. But the problem says \"find\" one. Maybe in the original problem, there's a unique solution? Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is in Russian, and the user is translated. The original problem might have a unique solution. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me check again.\n\nWe had t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. The discriminant was 8, which is a quadratic residue. Then, using the quadratic formula, we found t ≡ [ -2 ± sqrt(8) ] / 2 mod 23. Then, sqrt(8) ≡ 10 or 13 mod 23. Then, substituting back, we got t ≡ 4 or 17 mod 23. So both are solutions. Therefore, the answer is both 4 and 17. But the problem says \"find\" one. Maybe in the original problem, there's a unique solution? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic formula.\n\nWait, let me check the quadratic formula again. The equation is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. So, in the quadratic formula, the solutions are t ≡ [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a) mod p. Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -1. So discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 4 + 4 = 8. Then, sqrt(D) ≡ sqrt(8) mod 23. As we found, sqrt(8) ≡ 10 or 13 mod 23. Then, t ≡ [ -2 ± 10 ] / 2 mod 23. So t ≡ (8)/2 = 4 mod 23 or t ≡ (-12)/2 = -6 ≡ 17 mod 23. So yes, t = 4 and t = 17. Therefore, both are solutions. Therefore, the answer is both 4 and 17. But the problem says \"find\" one. Maybe in the original problem, there's a unique solution? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.

The problem is about Kakšna, who has a total surface area of 1000 square centimeters, and she wants to make a box that's a cube with a volume of 1000 cubic centimeters. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out the dimensions of the cube. \n\nSince it's a cube, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each edge 'a'. The volume of a cube is given by \\( a^3 \\), and the surface area is \\( 6a^2 \\). The problem states that the volume is 1000 cubic centimeters, so I can set up the equation:\n\n\\( a^3 = 1000 \\)\n\nTo find 'a', I need to take the cube root of 1000. Let me calculate that. The cube root of 1000 is 10, because 10*10*10 is 1000. So, each edge of the cube is 10 centimeters. \n\nNow, the surface area of the cube is \\( 6a^2 \\). Plugging in 'a' as 10, that would be \\( 6*(10)^2 \\). Let's compute that. 10 squared is 100, so 6*100 is 600. So, the surface area of the cube is 600 square centimeters. \n\nBut the problem says Kakšna has a total surface area of 1000 square centimeters. So, if she uses the cube, she can only cover 600 square centimeters. That means she needs more material. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the problem is asking for the surface area of the cube or the remaining material. The problem says \"Kakšna is skupna tetraedri, v kubice palceh, kocke z volumnom 1 kgs pravilne pravilnog kubika.\" Wait, maybe I misread.

Hmm, let me recall what a conjugate is. I think the conjugate of a binomial like \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\) is \\(a - \\sqrt{b}\\). So, if the original number is \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\), its conjugate should be \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\). \n\nNow, to find the product of these two numbers, I can use the formula for multiplying conjugates. Remember that \\((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\\). Let me apply that here. \n\nSo, substituting \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{3}\\), the product would be \\(5^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2\\). Let me compute each part step by step. \n\nFirst, \\(5^2\\) is straightforward. 5 squared is 25. Then, \\((\\sqrt{3})^2\\) is just 3, because the square root and the square cancel each other out. \n\nSo, putting it all together: \\(25 - 3 = 22\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I multiply \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) by \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\), using the distributive property (FOIL method), I get:\n\nFirst: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n\nOuter: \\(5 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -5\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nInner: \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times 5 = 5\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nLast: \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -3\\)\n\nNow, combining all these terms: 25 -5√3 +5√3 -3. The middle terms, -5√3 and +5√3, cancel each other out. So, we're left with 25 -3, which is 22. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, the product of \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and its conjugate \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\) is 22. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"nastiega conjugata\", which is another way of saying conjugate. So, yes, that's correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe product is \\boxed{22}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the product of the number \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and its conjugate \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\), we use the formula for multiplying conjugates, which is \\((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\\).\n\nHere, \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{3}\\). Applying the formula:\n\n\\[\n(5 + \\sqrt{3})(5 - \\sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these results:\n\n\\[\n25 - 3 = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of \\(5 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and its conjugate \\(5 - \\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).", "answer": "22"}

Kakšna je vrednost $g(f(5)-1)$?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. I need to find the value of g(f(5) - 1). Hmm, so first, I have to figure out what f(5) is, right? Then subtract 1 from that result, and then apply the function g to that new value. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with f(x) = 2x - 3. To find f(5), I substitute 5 into the function. So, f(5) = 2*5 - 3. Let me calculate that. 2 times 5 is 10, minus 3 is 7. So f(5) is 7. Got that part.\n\nNext, the problem says f(5) - 1. So I subtract 1 from 7. That gives 7 - 1 = 6. So now I need to find g(6). \n\nNow, g(x) is given as x + 1. So substituting 6 into g(x), that would be 6 + 1. Let me compute that. 6 plus 1 is 7. So the final answer should be 7. \n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, f(5): 2*5 is 10, minus 3 is 7. That seems right. Then subtract 1: 7 - 1 = 6. Then g(6): 6 + 1 = 7. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nI don't see any errors in the calculations. Let me just verify once more. \n\nf(5) = 2*5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7. Correct. Then 7 - 1 = 6. Then g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's correct. \n\nI think that's all. The answer should be 7. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{7}\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate \\( f(5) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(5) = 2 \\cdot 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 1 from the result of \\( f(5) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3.

I need to solve the equation \\(\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1} (x) + \\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Hmm, trigonometric equation with inverse trigonometric functions. Let me start by recalling some properties of inverse trigonometric functions and maybe use some trigonometric identities to simplify the expression inside the sine function.\n\nFirst, let's denote \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1} (x)\\). That means \\(\\tan \\theta = x\\), and since \\(\\tan^{-1}\\) gives an angle in the range \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we can assume that \\(x\\) is positive because \\(\\tan^{-1}\\) of a negative number would be in the fourth quadrant, but since \\(\\cot^{-1}\\) is involved, maybe we need to consider the principal values. Wait, actually, \\(\\cot^{-1}\\) is defined for all real numbers except zero, and its range is \\(0 < \\cot^{-1} y < \\pi\\). So, if \\(x\\) is positive, \\(\\tan^{-1} x\\) is in the first quadrant, and \\(\\cot^{-1} (1/x)\\) would be in the first quadrant as well because \\(1/x\\) is positive. If \\(x\\) is negative, \\(\\tan^{-1} x\\) would be in the fourth quadrant, but \\(\\cot^{-1} (1/x)\\) would be in the second quadrant because \\(1/x\\) is negative. However, since \\(\\cot^{-1} (1/x)\\) is defined for all real numbers except zero, maybe we can handle both cases. But maybe there's a way to simplify the expression without considering the sign of \\(x\\). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity that relates \\(\\tan^{-1} x\\) and \\(\\cot^{-1} (1/x)\\). Let's recall that \\(\\cot^{-1} y = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1} y\\). So, if I let \\(y = 1/x\\), then \\(\\cot^{-1} (1/x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1} (1/x)\\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} x + \\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = \\tan^{-1} x + \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nHmm, so the expression inside the sine is \\(\\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Let me denote this as \\(A + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), where \\(A = \\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Maybe I can compute \\(A\\) first.\n\nLet me compute \\(A = \\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Let me recall that \\(\\tan^{-1} a - \\tan^{-1} b = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{a - b}{1 + ab} \\right)\\), provided that \\(ab > -1\\). Let's check if that applies here. Let \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 1/x\\). Then \\(ab = x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = 1\\). So, the formula would be \\(\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - 1/x}{1 + x \\cdot 1/x} \\right) = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - 1/x}{2} \\right)\\). But since \\(ab = 1\\), the formula doesn't directly apply. Wait, maybe I need to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that \\(\\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Let me set \\(\\alpha = \\tan^{-1} x\\) and \\(\\beta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Then, \\(\\tan \\alpha = x\\) and \\(\\tan \\beta = \\frac{1}{x}\\). Then, \\(\\alpha - \\beta = \\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Let me compute \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha - \\tan \\beta}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\beta} = \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{1 + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(\\alpha - \\beta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right)\\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function is:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} x - \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, so the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, using the identity \\(\\sin \\left( \\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\cos \\theta\\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\left( \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, now we have \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{3}\\), where \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right)\\). Therefore, \\(\\theta = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\\). But \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right)\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTaking the tangent of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} = \\tan \\left( \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet me compute \\(\\tan \\left( \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\right)\\). Let \\(\\phi = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\\), so \\(\\cos \\phi = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Then, \\(\\sin \\phi = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{9}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\). Therefore, \\(\\tan \\phi = \\frac{\\sin \\phi}{\\cos \\phi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}/3}{1/3} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{x} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 1 = 4\\sqrt{2} x\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4\\sqrt{2} x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(4\\sqrt{2})^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2}\n\\]\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n\\[\n(4\\sqrt{2})^2 + 4 = 32 + 4 = 36\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} \\pm 6}{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\pm 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\) and \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2} - 3\\). But we need to check if these solutions are valid. Since the original equation involves \\(\\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\), which is defined for all real numbers except zero. So, \\(x\\) can be any real number except zero. Both solutions \\(2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\) and \\(2\\sqrt{2} - 3\\) are real numbers, so they are valid. However, we need to check if they satisfy the original equation.\n\nWait, but before that, let me verify if these solutions are correct. Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1} (x) + \\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nWe transformed it into:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\left( \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, using the identity \\(\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos \\theta\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\left( \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} \\right)\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{3}\\), so \\(\\theta = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\\), and \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{x}}{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), leading to \\(x - \\frac{1}{x} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\), which is correct. Then, solving the quadratic equation gives \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2} \\pm 3\\). So, these are the solutions.\n\nBut we need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equation. Let's test \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\):\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\tan^{-1} x\\). Let me compute \\(\\tan^{-1} (2\\sqrt{2} + 3)\\). Let me denote \\(\\alpha = \\tan^{-1} (2\\sqrt{2} + 3)\\). Then, \\(\\tan \\alpha = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\). Let me compute \\(\\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\). Since \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2} + 3}\\). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2} + 3} = \\frac{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}{(2\\sqrt{2} + 3)(3 - 2\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}{9 - 8} = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\cot^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = \\cot^{-1} (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})\\). Let me compute \\(\\cot^{-1} (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})\\). Let me denote \\(\\beta = \\cot^{-1} (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})\\). Then, \\(\\cot \\beta = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\tan \\beta = \\frac{1}{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}\\).

Therefore, \\(\\beta = \\tan^{-1} (3 + 2\\sqrt{2})\\). Therefore, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} (2\\sqrt{2} + 3) + \\tan^{-1} (3 + 2\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nBut let's compute \\(\\tan^{-1} (2\\sqrt{2} + 3) + \\tan^{-1} (3 + 2\\sqrt{2})\\).

One line is given by the vector equation with a point and a direction vector, and the other line is also given with a point and a direction vector. The problem says to use the parameters t and u for the two lines. \n\nFirst, let me recall that two lines in 3D space intersect if there exist values of t and u such that the coordinates of the points on both lines are equal. So, I need to set up equations where the x, y, and z components of both parametric equations are equal. That should give me a system of equations to solve for t and u. Once I find t and u, I can substitute them back into one of the parametric equations to get the point of intersection.\n\nLet me write down the parametric equations for both lines. \n\nFor the first line (Ena proper):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSo, the coordinates are:\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = -10 - 9t\nz = 1 - 2t\n\nFor the second line (Dr re proper):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSo, the coordinates are:\nx = -5 + 4u\ny = -3 - 18u\nz = 6 - 4u\n\nNow, to find the intersection, set the x, y, and z components equal to each other. That gives me three equations:\n\n1. 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u\n2. -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u\n3. 1 - 2t = 6 - 4u\n\nI need to solve this system of equations for t and u. Let's start with the first equation:\n\n3 + 2t = -5 + 4u\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for t:\n\n2t = -5 - 3 + 4u  \n2t = -8 + 4u  \nt = (-8 + 4u)/2  \nt = -4 + 2u\n\nOkay, so t is expressed in terms of u. Now, let's substitute this expression for t into the second equation:\n\n-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u\n\nSubstitute t = -4 + 2u:\n\n-10 - 9(-4 + 2u) = -3 - 18u  \n-10 + 36 - 18u = -3 - 18u  \n26 - 18u = -3 - 18u\n\nNow, let's subtract -18u from both sides:\n\n26 = -3\n\nWait, that's not possible. That suggests that there is no solution for u, which would mean the lines are parallel and do not intersect. But that can't be right because the problem states that they intersect. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me check the substitution again. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst equation: 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u  \nSolving for t: 2t = -5 -3 +4u  \n2t = -8 +4u  \nt = (-8 +4u)/2  \nt = -4 + 2u. That's correct.\n\nSecond equation: -10 -9t = -3 -18u  \nSubstitute t = -4 + 2u:\n\n-10 -9(-4 + 2u) = -3 -18u  \n-10 +36 -18u = -3 -18u  \n26 -18u = -3 -18u  \nNow, subtract -18u from both sides: 26 = -3  \nWait, that's impossible. So, this suggests that there is no solution, meaning the lines are parallel and do not intersect. But the problem says they intersect, so I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction vectors? Let me check the direction vectors again.\n\nFor Ena proper: direction vector is [2, -9, -2]. For Dr re proper: direction vector is [4, -18, -4]. Let me check if these vectors are scalar multiples. \n\n4 is 2*2, -18 is -9*2, -4 is -2*2. So yes, the direction vector for Dr re proper is 2 times the direction vector for Ena proper. That means the two lines are parallel. But the problem states they intersect, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"dr re proper\" is defined with direction vector [4, -18, -4], which is 2 times the direction vector of Ena proper [2, -9, -2].

The problem is about finding how many points from the given set are inside the right-angled triangle formed by the points (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). Hmm, first, I need to visualize this. \n\nThese four points form a rectangle because the opposite sides are equal and parallel. The rectangle is centered at the origin (0,0) since the x-coordinates go from -5 to 5 and the y-coordinates from -4 to 4. So, the rectangle is 10 units wide (from -5 to 5) and 8 units tall (from -4 to 4). \n\nNow, the right-angled triangle is formed by connecting these four points.

I need to find the cross product of (2b - a) and (3c + a). Hmm, cross products can be tricky, but maybe I can use some properties to simplify this. Let me recall that cross product is distributive over addition and scalar multiplication. So, maybe I can expand the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write out the cross product:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.\n\nWait, that's right. The distributive property says that (u + v) × w = u × w + v × w, and similarly for the other terms. So, expanding each term:\n\nFirst term: 2b × 3c = 6b × c.\n\nSecond term: 2b × a.\n\nThird term: -a × 3c = -3a × c.\n\nFourth term: -a × a.\n\nNow, let's handle each of these terms one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 6b × c. Hmm, but I don't know what b × c is. The problem gives me a × b, a × c, and b × c. So, maybe I can find b × c using the given information?\n\nWait, cross product is anti-commutative, so b × c = -c × b. Also, cross product is anti-commutative with respect to the scalar multiple, so a × c = -c × a. Similarly, a × b = -b × a.\n\nBut I don't know if there's a way to relate b × c to the given cross products. Let me think. Maybe I can use the scalar triple product or some other identity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express b × c in terms of the given cross products. Let's see. The problem gives a × b, a × c, and b × c. So, if I can find b × c, then I can compute the first term. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the cross product is anti-commutative. Let's see. If I take the cross product of a and b, which is given as [6, -7, 3], then the cross product of b and a would be -[6, -7, 3] = [-6, 7, -3]. Similarly, the cross product of c and a would be -[4, 7, 2] = [-4, -7, -2]. But I don't know if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the scalar triple product. The scalar triple product a · (b × c) is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors a, b, c. But I don't know if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, another thought: the cross product is anti-commutative, so a × b = -b × a. Similarly, a × c = -c × a. So, if I can find b × c, then I can use that to compute the first term. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the cross product is anti-commutative. Let's see. If I take the cross product of a and b, which is given, then the cross product of b and a would be -[6, -7, 3] = [-6, 7, -3]. Similarly, the cross product of c and a would be -[4, 7, 2] = [-4, -7, -2]. But I don't know if that helps directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the scalar triple product. The scalar triple product a · (b × c) is equal to the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors a, b, c. But I don't know the determinant. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the cross product is anti-commutative. Let's see.

We need to find out how many stamps he has in the 70s, specifically in the 70s, in the country of Brazil. The answer should be rounded to the nearest centimeter, which probably means rounding to the nearest whole number of stamps. \n\nFirst, let me try to parse the given data. The table is divided into years (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s) and countries (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain). Each cell in the table shows the number of stamps in the respective decade and country. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 50s: Brazil (4), France (8), Peru (6), Spain (3)\n- 60s: Brazil (7), France (4), Peru (4), Spain (9)\n- 70s: Brazil (12), France (12), Peru (6), Spain (13)\n- 80s: Brazil (8), France (15), Peru (10), Spain (9)\n\nWe need to find the number of stamps in the 70s for Brazil.

Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Juan's stamp collection from the 1950s to the 1980s. In the 70s, in the country of Brazil, how many stamps were there? Round to the nearest centimeter, which would be the nearest whole number of stamps.\"\n\nSo, the key here is that the number of stamps is given in centimeters, but the answer needs to be in centimeters. Wait, but the number of stamps is a count, so it's a whole number. Rounding to the nearest centimeter would mean rounding to the nearest whole number. But since the number of stamps is already a whole number, the answer should just be the number of stamps in the 70s for Brazil, which is 12.

I need to find the area of triangle ACD in trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. The given conditions are that AC is perpendicular to CD, and the area of the trapezoid is 42. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. Hmm, okay. Let me start by drawing a diagram in my mind. \n\nFirst, trapezoid ABCD with AD || BC. So, sides AD and BC are the two parallel bases. The other two sides, AB and CD, are the legs. Since it's a trapezoid, the legs are not necessarily equal. \n\nGiven that AC is perpendicular to CD, that means angle ACD is 90 degrees. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC equals angle CAD. That might be useful. \n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 42. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. But I don't know the lengths of AD and BC, or the height. Maybe I need to relate these variables. \n\nLet me denote the lengths of the bases: let AD = a and BC = b. Let the height of the trapezoid be h. Then the area is (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42. So, (a + b)*h = 84. \n\nNow, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle at C. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*AC*CD. But I need to find AC and CD. \n\nBut how do I relate AC and CD to the trapezoid? Let's think about the angles. AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAD as 2θ, so each of the bisected angles is θ. \n\nIn triangle ABC, angle at A is 2θ, and angle at B is some angle. Wait, but in trapezoid ABCD, angle BAD is 2θ, and angle ABC is... Since AD is parallel to BC, the angles at A and B are related. Wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180 degrees. Similarly, angle BCD + angle CDA = 180 degrees. \n\nBut angle BAD is 2θ, so angle ABC = 180 - 2θ. \n\nNow, in triangle ABC, we have angle at A is 2θ, angle at B is 180 - 2θ, and angle at C is... Let me see. Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, angle at C is 180 - 2θ - (180 - 2θ) = 0? That can't be. Wait, maybe I need to consider the angles in the trapezoid. \n\nWait, in trapezoid ABCD, sides AD and BC are parallel. So, angle BAD and angle ABC are consecutive angles between the bases. Therefore, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180 degrees. Since angle BAD is 2θ, angle ABC is 180 - 2θ. \n\nNow, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 2θ, angle at B is 180 - 2θ, and angle at C is... Let me think. Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, angle at C is 180 - 2θ - (180 - 2θ) = 0. That can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, in trapezoid ABCD, sides AD and BC are parallel. So, angle BAD and angle ABC are consecutive angles between the bases.

Then, the angle at C in triangle ABC would be 180 - 2θ - (180 - 2θ) = 0. That can't be. Wait, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation here. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the angles in triangle ABC differently. Let me try again. \n\nIn trapezoid ABCD, AD is parallel to BC. So, angle BAD and angle ABC are consecutive angles between the bases. Therefore, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180 degrees.

Let me start by recalling how to handle equations with square roots. \n\nFirst, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. That often helps when dealing with radicals. Let me try that. \n\nSo, squaring both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x - 1}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the left side: the square of a square root is the original expression inside, so that becomes \\(\\frac{2x}{3x - 1}\\). The right side is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\). So now the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nOkay, now I have a rational equation. To solve this, I can cross-multiply. That should eliminate the denominators. Let me do that. \n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n2x \\cdot 4 = 9 \\cdot (3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(2x \\times 4 = 8x\\)\n\nRight side: \\(9 \\times 3x - 9 \\times 1 = 27x - 9\\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n8x = 27x - 9\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(x\\). Subtract \\(27x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n8x - 27x = -9\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-19x = -9\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by -19:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-9}{-19} = \\frac{9}{19}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = \\frac{9}{19}\\). \n\nBut wait, before I accept this as the solution, I need to check if this value of \\(x\\) satisfies the original equation.

I need to find the simplified value of the operation defined as \\(\\frac{m}{n} @ \\frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\\left(\\frac{q}{n}\\right)\\) for the fractions \\(\\frac{7}{30}\\) and \\(\\frac{10}{21}\\). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the operation is defined as multiplying the numerators \\(m\\) and \\(p\\), then multiplying that result by the fraction \\(\\frac{q}{n}\\). So, in other words, it's like \\((m \\times p) \\times \\frac{q}{n}\\). Let me write that out with the given fractions. \n\nThe first fraction is \\(\\frac{7}{30}\\), so \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 30\\). The second fraction is \\(\\frac{10}{21}\\), so \\(p = 10\\) and \\(q = 21\\). Plugging these into the operation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21} = (7 \\times 10) \\times \\frac{21}{30}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\). Then, the denominator is 30. So now we have:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{21}{30}\n\\]\n\nHmm, this seems like a multiplication of a number and a fraction. Let me simplify that. Maybe I can simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{30}\\) first before multiplying. Let's see. Both 21 and 30 are divisible by 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\div 3}{30 \\div 3} = \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{21}{30}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiplying 70 by \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\). Let's do that. 70 times 7 is 490, and then divide by 10. So:\n\n\\[\n490 \\div 10 = 49\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, I can write 70 as \\(7 \\times 10\\), so:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = (7 \\times 10) \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 7 \\times (10 \\times \\frac{7}{10}) = 7 \\times 7 = 49\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So the simplified value is 49. Let me verify once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.\n\nFirst, I converted the operation into multiplication of numerators and the fraction. Then, I simplified the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{30}\\) to \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\). Then multiplied 70 by \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\), which is 49. That seems right. Let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the original fractions first and then apply the operation. Let's see. \n\nFirst, compute \\(\\frac{7}{30}\\) and \\(\\frac{10}{21}\\). Then, according to the operation, multiply the numerators and the fraction \\(\\frac{q}{n}\\). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21} = \\frac{7 \\times 10}{30 \\times 21} \\times \\frac{21}{30}\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, the operation is defined as (m)(p)(q/n). So, in the original fractions, m is 7, p is 10, q is 21, and n is 30. So, substituting into the operation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\\left(\\frac{21}{30}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 10 \\times \\frac{21}{30}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{21}{30}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 49\n\\]\n\nSo, same result. So, regardless of the order, the answer is 49. Therefore, the simplified value is 49. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check if there's any alternative interpretation of the operation. The problem says: \"for p/q, the operation is defined as (m)(p)(q/n)\". So, m is the numerator of the first fraction, p is the numerator of the second fraction, q is the denominator of the second fraction, and n is the denominator of the first fraction. So, that's exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the operation is (m)(p)(q/n), but in the problem statement, it's written as (m)(p)(q/n). So, the order is m, then p, then q/n. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 49. I think that's correct. Let me just check with another example. Suppose I have fractions 1/2 and 3/4. Applying the operation:\n\n1/2 @ 3/4 = (1)(3)(4/2) = 3 * 2 = 6. Let's compute the actual value. 1/2 is 0.5, 3/4 is 0.75. Multiplying 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375. Then, according to the operation, it's 3 * 0.5 * 0.75 = 3 * 0.375 = 1.125. Wait, but 1.125 is 9/8, which is 1.125. Wait, but 0.375 is 3/8, so 3*(3/8) = 9/8. So, 9/8 is 1.125. So, that's correct. So, the operation works. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, 7/30 @ 10/21 = 49. So, the answer is 49. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified value is \\boxed{49}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the simplified value of the operation \\(\\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21}\\) defined as \\((m)(p)\\left(\\frac{q}{n}\\right)\\) for fractions \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the values of \\(m\\), \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(n\\) from the given fractions:\n   - For \\(\\frac{7}{30}\\), \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 30\\).\n   - For \\(\\frac{10}{21}\\), \\(p = 10\\) and \\(q = 21\\).\n\n2. Substitute these values into the operation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{30} @ \\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\\left(\\frac{21}{30}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{30}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{30} = \\frac{7}{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply the simplified fraction by the other terms:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 10 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 7 \\times 7 = 49\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified value is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).", "answer": "49"}

I need to find the measure of angle ADC in degrees, given that the total area of the two circles is 5/12 the area of the larger one. Hmm, let me start by recalling the formulas for the area of a circle. The area of a circle is πr², right? So if there are two circles, one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2, their areas would be π(1)² and π(2)², which are π and 4π respectively. \n\nWait, but the problem says the total area of the two circles is 5/12 the area of the larger one. The larger one is the one with radius 2, so its area is 4π. The total area of both circles is π + 4π = 5π. According to the problem, this total area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. Let me check that: 5/12 * 4π = (5/12)*4π = (20/12)π = (5/3)π. But the total area is 5π. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

I need to figure out how much water I need to fill a cylinder that's 8 cm tall and has a radius of 3 cm. The cylinder is going to be filled with a sphere that has a radius of 6 cm. Hmm, so the problem is about volume. I remember that the volume of a cylinder is π times the radius squared times the height, and the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π times the radius cubed. But wait, the sphere is going to be placed inside the cylinder, right? So the cylinder must have a radius at least as big as the sphere's radius. Let me check that. The sphere has a radius of 6 cm, so the cylinder's radius is 3 cm, which is smaller. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

I need to calculate this expression: sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) multiplied by sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4). Hmm, arcsin is the inverse sine function, right? So arcsin 0.4 is the angle whose sine is 0.4, and similarly for 0.5. Let me denote these angles as α and β for simplicity. So α = arcsin 0.4 and β = arcsin 0.5. Then the expression becomes sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). \n\nI remember that there are some trigonometric identities for sine of sums and differences. Let me recall: sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, and sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B. So if I can express sin(α + β) and sin(β - α) using these identities, then multiply them together, maybe there's a way to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me write that out. First, sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β. Then sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α. So multiplying these two together:\n\n[sin α cos β + cos α sin β] * [sin β cos α - cos β sin α]\n\nLet me expand this product. Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst term: sin α cos β * sin β cos α = sin α sin β cos α cos β\n\nSecond term: sin α cos β * (-cos β sin α) = -sin² α cos² β\n\nThird term: cos α sin β * sin β cos α = cos² α sin² β\n\nFourth term: cos α sin β * (-cos β sin α) = -cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nSo combining all these terms:\n\nsin α sin β cos α cos β - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β - cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nHmm, let's see if some terms cancel out. The first and fourth terms both have sin α sin β cos α cos β, so they add up. The second and third terms are -sin² α cos² β and +cos² α sin² β. Let me factor out the negative sign from the second and third terms:\n\n= sin α sin β cos α cos β - [sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β]\n\nHmm, maybe we can factor something out here. Let's look at the expression inside the brackets: sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β. Let me factor sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β. Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Let me see:\n\n= sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β\n\n= (sin α cos β)^2 - (cos α sin β)^2\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: (a² - b²) = (a - b)(a + b). So here, a = sin α cos β and b = cos α sin β. Therefore:\n\n= (sin α cos β - cos α sin β)(sin α cos β + cos α sin β)\n\nBut wait, sin α cos β - cos α sin β is sin(α - β) and sin α cos β + cos α sin β is sin(α + β). So:\n\n= sin(α - β) * sin(α + β)\n\nTherefore, going back to the original expression:\n\nsin(α + β) * sin(β - α) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β)\n\nBut we just found that sin(α - β) * sin(α + β) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β) = sin(α + β) * sin(α - β). Wait, that's circular. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). Let me note that sin(β - α) = sin(- (α - β)) = - sin(α - β). So sin(β - α) = - sin(α - β). Therefore, the original expression becomes sin(α + β) * (- sin(α - β)) = - sin(α + β) sin(α - β). But according to the previous step, sin(α + β) sin(α - β) = sin(α + β) sin(α - β). So this seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the expansion step by step.\n\nOriginal expression: sin(α + β) * sin(β - α)\n\nFirst, expand sin(α + β):\n\n= sin α cos β + cos α sin β\n\nThen expand sin(β - α):\n\n= sin β cos α - cos β sin α\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n= (sin α cos β + cos α sin β)(sin β cos α - cos β sin α)\n\nLet me multiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: sin α cos β * sin β cos α = sin α sin β cos α cos β\n\nSecond term: sin α cos β * (-cos β sin α) = - sin² α cos² β\n\nThird term: cos α sin β * sin β cos α = cos² α sin² β\n\nFourth term: cos α sin β * (-cos β sin α) = - cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nsin α sin β cos α cos β - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β - cos α cos β sin α sin β\n\nNow, let's group like terms:\n\nThe first and fourth terms: sin α sin β cos α cos β - cos α cos β sin α sin β = 0\n\nSo those cancel out.\n\nThen we have - sin² α cos² β + cos² α sin² β\n\nFactor out sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β\n\nWait, that's sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β = sin² α cos² β - cos² α sin² β\n\nHmm, this is similar to the difference of squares.

Kakšna je hitrost kolesa izražena v palcih na sekundo?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Kolo potting 20 cheese blocks in a minute. We need to find out how many cheese blocks he can make in a thousand seconds. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out his rate of potting cheese blocks per second, then multiply that by 1000 to get the total for a thousand seconds. \n\nLet me start by converting the time units. The problem gives the rate in minutes, but the question is about seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I can convert the rate from per minute to per second. \n\nSo, Kolo pots 20 cheese blocks in 1 minute. To find out how many he pots in 1 second, I divide 20 by 60. Let me do that calculation. 20 divided by 60 is 1/3. So, he pots 1/3 of a cheese block every second. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many blocks he can make in 1000 seconds. Since he pots 1/3 of a block each second, multiplying that rate by 1000 should give the total. \n\nSo, 1/3 times 1000. Let me compute that. 1000 divided by 3 is approximately 333.333... So, he can make about 333 and a third cheese blocks in 1000 seconds. But since he can't pot a fraction of a block, maybe we need to round down? The problem doesn't specify, but in real life, you can't make a partial block. So, the answer would be 333 blocks. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's verify the steps again. \n\n1. Convert minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds. \n2. Rate per second: 20 blocks / 60 seconds = 1/3 block per second. \n3. Multiply by 1000 seconds: (1/3) * 1000 = 1000/3 ≈ 333.333. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, 333 blocks. But maybe the question expects an exact fraction or a whole number? The problem says \"koversna\" which is a translation, but in the original language, maybe it's \"koversna\" which is a countable unit. So, 333 and a third blocks. But since you can't have a third block, it's 333. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting an exact answer in terms of a fraction. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"koversna\" which is a countable unit, so 333 and a third blocks. But in the context of a math problem, usually, if it's a rate problem, they might want the exact fraction. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe the problem is in another language, and \"koversna\" is a countable unit. So, 333 and a third blocks. But since you can't have a third block, it's 333. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where you can't have a third block, so you have to round down. So, 333 blocks. \n\nBut let me think again. If Kolo pots 20 blocks in 1 minute, then in 1000 seconds, which is 1000/60 ≈ 16.666 minutes, he would pot 20 * (1000/60) blocks. Let's compute that. \n\n20 * (1000/60) = (20 * 1000)/60 = 20000/60 = 1000/3 ≈ 333.333. So, same result. So, 333.333 blocks. \n\nBut since he can't pot a third block, the answer is 333 blocks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where you have to consider that he can only pot whole blocks. So, 333 blocks. \n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just \"koversna\" which is a countable unit, so 333 and a third blocks. But since you can't have a third block, it's 333. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in a different language where \"koversna\" is a countable unit, so 333 and a third blocks. But in the original problem, it's just a rate. So, 333.333 blocks. \n\nBut in the context of a math problem, if they want an exact answer, they might want the fraction. So, 1000/3 blocks. But since the question is in a format that expects a whole number, maybe 333. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where you have to consider that he can only pot whole blocks.

So, he has 8 countries in 6 countries. And he wants to form a committee of 5 countries, each of which has at least one representative from each country. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. Senatni has 8 countries, and he's in 6 countries. So, he's a bit behind in the game. Now, he wants to form a committee of 5 countries. The catch is that each country in the committee must have at least one representative from each country. Wait, that seems like a lot of conditions. Maybe I need to rephrase the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"načinov Englishmen, da s 5člani, ki docegatno z vseh stronov z vseh 8 znamenov docegatno oblikuvat.\" So, in English, that would be: \"How many ways can Englishmen form a committee of 5 countries, each of which has at least one representative from each country?\" So, each country in the committee must have at least one representative from each country. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\n\"Each country in the committee must have at least one representative from each country.\" So, if there are 5 countries in the committee, each of those 5 countries must have at least one representative from each of the 8 countries. But that can't be right. If each country in the committee has at least one representative from each country, that would mean that each country in the committee has 8 representatives, one from each country. But that would require 5 countries each with 8 representatives, totaling 40 representatives. But the total number of countries is 8, so each country would have 5 representatives. But the problem says \"each country in the committee must have at least one representative from each country.\" So, if there are 5 countries in the committee, each of those 5 countries must have at least one representative from each of the 8 countries. That would mean that each country in the committee has 8 representatives, one from each country. But that's impossible because there are only 8 countries. So, each country in the committee would have to have 8 representatives, but there are only 8 countries. So, that can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem is translated from another language, and the translation is slightly off. Let me check again. The original problem says: \"načinov Englishmen, da s 5člani, ki docegatno z vseh stronov z vseh 8 znamenov docegatno oblikuvat.\" So, in English, that would be: \"How many ways can Englishmen form a committee of 5 countries, each of which has at least one representative from each country?\" So, each country in the committee must have at least one representative from each country.

That would require that each country in the committee has 8 representatives, one from each country.

{"original_question": "Kakšna je vrednost $513^2 - 487^2$?", "question": "Kakšna je vrednost $513^2 - 487^2$?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. I need to find the value of \\(513^2 - 487^2\\). Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the difference of squares. Let me recall. The difference of squares formula is \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). So maybe I can apply that here. \n\nLet me check. If I let \\(a = 513\\) and \\(b = 487\\), then \\(a^2 - b^2\\) should equal \\((513 - 487)(513 + 487)\\). Let me compute those two terms. \n\nFirst, \\(513 - 487\\). Let's subtract them. 513 minus 487. 513 minus 400 is 113, and then minus 87 more is 26. So \\(513 - 487 = 26\\). \n\nNext, \\(513 + 487\\). Let's add those two numbers. 500 plus 400 is 900, and 13 plus 87 is 100. So \\(513 + 487 = 1000\\). \n\nTherefore, \\(513^2 - 487^2 = 26 \\times 1000 = 26,000\\). \n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute \\(513^2\\) and \\(487^2\\) separately and subtract them. Let's try that. \n\nFirst, \\(513^2\\). Let's compute that. 513 squared. \n\n513 times 513. Let's break it down. 500 squared is 250,000. Then, 500 times 13 is 6,500, and 13 times 500 is also 6,500. Then, 13 squared is 169. So, using the formula \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), where \\(a = 500\\) and \\(b = 13\\), so \\(513^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*13 + 13^2 = 250,000 + 13,000 + 169 = 250,000 + 13,000 is 263,000, plus 169 is 263,169. \n\nSimilarly, \\(487^2\\). Let's do the same. 487 squared. Let's write 487 as 500 - 13. So, \\((500 - 13)^2 = 500^2 - 2*500*13 + 13^2 = 250,000 - 13,000 + 169 = 250,000 - 13,000 is 237,000, plus 169 is 237,169. \n\nNow, subtract \\(487^2\\) from \\(513^2\\): 263,169 - 237,169. Let's compute that. 263,169 minus 237,169. The thousands place: 263,000 minus 237,000 is 26,000. Then, the remaining digits: 169 - 169 is 0. So total is 26,000. \n\nSo both methods give the same result: 26,000. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. For example, using the formula for the difference of squares. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the expression. Since it's \\(a^2 - b^2\\), which factors into \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). So, as before, that gives 26*1000=26,000. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the difference of squares in another way. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write \\(513^2 - 487^2\\) as \\((513 - 487)(513 + 487)\\).

Katero je največje izmed teh treh zaporednih celih števil?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the product of three numbers is 120. Then, the product of one number and the sum of the other two is 24. We need to find the maximum possible value among these three numbers. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand. We have three numbers, let's call them a, b, and c. Their product is 120, so a*b*c = 120. Then, the product of one number and the sum of the other two is 24. So, for example, a*(b + c) = 24, or b*(a + c) = 24, or c*(a + b) = 24. The question is asking for the maximum possible value among a, b, c. \n\nHmm. So, we need to find three numbers such that their product is 120, and one of them times the sum of the other two is 24. Then, among these three numbers, we need the largest one. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe we can express one variable in terms of the others using the given equations. Let's suppose that a*(b + c) = 24. Then, since a*b*c = 120, we can write a = 120/(b*c). Then, substituting into the first equation: (120/(b*c))*(b + c) = 24. Let's simplify that. \n\nSo, 120*(b + c)/(b*c) = 24. Then, dividing both sides by 12, we get 10*(b + c)/(b*c) = 2. Then, multiplying both sides by b*c, we get 10*(b + c) = 2*b*c. Then, dividing both sides by 2, we have 5*(b + c) = b*c. \n\nSo, 5b + 5c = b*c. Let's rearrange this equation. Let's bring all terms to one side: b*c - 5b - 5c = 0. Then, adding 25 to both sides to complete the square: b*c -5b -5c +25 =25. Then, factoring the left side: (b -5)(c -5) =25. \n\nSo, (b -5)(c -5) =25. That's a key equation. So, the product of (b -5) and (c -5) is 25. Since 25 is a positive number, both factors must be positive or both negative. But since we are dealing with numbers that could be positive or negative, but since we are looking for the maximum possible value among a, b, c, which are positive numbers (since their product is 120, which is positive, so all three numbers must be positive). Therefore, (b -5) and (c -5) must both be positive. So, (b -5) and (c -5) are positive integers whose product is 25. \n\nSo, possible pairs for (b -5, c -5) are (1,25), (5,5), (25,1). Then, translating back to b and c:\n\nIf (b -5, c -5) = (1,25), then b=6, c=30.\n\nIf (b -5, c -5) = (5,5), then b=10, c=10.\n\nIf (b -5, c -5) = (25,1), then b=30, c=6.\n\nSo, the possible pairs for (b, c) are (6,30), (10,10), (30,6). \n\nNow, for each of these pairs, we can find a from the equation a = 120/(b*c). Let's compute a for each case.\n\nFirst case: b=6, c=30. Then, a = 120/(6*30) = 120/180 = 2/3 ≈0.6667.\n\nSecond case: b=10, c=10. Then, a = 120/(10*10) = 120/100 = 1.2.\n\nThird case: b=30, c=6. Then, a = 120/(30*6) = 120/180 = 2/3 ≈0.6667.\n\nSo, the possible triples (a, b, c) are (2/3, 6, 30), (1.2, 10, 10), and (2/3, 30, 6). \n\nNow, we need to check which of these triples satisfies the second condition: one number times the sum of the other two equals 24. Let's check each case.\n\nFirst case: (2/3, 6, 30). Let's check a*(b + c) = (2/3)*(6 + 30) = (2/3)*36 = 24. That works.\n\nSecond case: (1.2, 10, 10). Let's check a*(b + c) = 1.2*(10 + 10) = 1.2*20 = 24. That works.\n\nThird case: (2/3, 30, 6). Let's check a*(b + c) = (2/3)*(30 + 6) = (2/3)*36 = 24. That works too.\n\nSo, all three triples satisfy the second condition. Now, among these triples, we need to find the maximum value. \n\nLooking at the triples:\n\nFirst case: 2/3, 6, 30. The maximum is 30.\n\nSecond case: 1.2, 10, 10. The maximum is 10.\n\nThird case: 2/3, 30, 6. The maximum is 30.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value among the three numbers is 30. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are other possible pairs for (b -5, c -5). Since 25 can be factored as 25*1 or 5*5, but we considered all possible positive integer pairs. Are there other factor pairs? For example, 25 can also be written as (-1)*(-25), but since we are dealing with positive numbers, those would lead to negative values for b and c, which are not allowed. So, the only possible pairs are (1,25), (5,5), (25,1). \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value is 30. \n\nBut let me verify once again. Let's take the triple (2/3, 6, 30). The product is (2/3)*6*30 = (2/3)*180 = 120. Correct. The sum of the other two is 6 + 30 = 36. Then, (2/3)*36 = 24. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, for (1.2, 10, 10): product is 1.2*10*10 = 120. Correct. The sum of the other two is 10 + 10 = 20. Then, 1.2*20 = 24. Correct. \n\nFor (2/3, 30, 6): same as first case. Correct. \n\nSo, all three triples satisfy the conditions. The maximum value among them is 30. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 30. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum possible value among the three numbers is \\boxed{30}.\n</think>\n\nGiven three numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that their product is 120, we have \\(a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 120\\). Additionally, one of the numbers times the sum of the other two is 24. We need to find the maximum possible value among these three numbers.\n\nWe start by expressing one variable in terms of the others. Let's assume \\(a \\cdot (b + c) = 24\\). Since \\(a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 120\\), we can write \\(a = \\frac{120}{b \\cdot c}\\).

I need to solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\). Hmm, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can simplify the expression inside the cube root first. \n\nLooking at \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\), I remember that this is a quadratic expression. Maybe it's a perfect square? Let me check. If I factor it, \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\) is equal to \\((x - 2)^2\\). Let me verify that: \\((x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\\). Yes, that's correct. So the equation simplifies to \\(\\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16\\).\n\nNow, cube roots and exponents are inverse operations, so maybe I can eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides. Let's try that. Cubing both sides gives \\((\\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3\\). The left side simplifies to \\((x - 2)^2\\), and the right side is 16 cubed. Let me compute 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is 4096. So, 16^3 = 4096. \n\nSo now the equation is \\((x - 2)^2 = 4096\\). To solve for \\(x\\), I need to take the square root of both sides. But wait, when you take the square root of both sides, you have to consider both the positive and negative roots. So, \\(\\sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{4096}\\). The square root of \\((x - 2)^2\\) is the absolute value of \\(x - 2\\), and the square root of 4096 is 64, since 64 squared is 4096. \n\nTherefore, we have \\(|x - 2| = 64\\). This absolute value equation means that \\(x - 2\\) could be either 64 or -64. So, we set up two equations: \\(x - 2 = 64\\) and \\(x - 2 = -64\\). Solving the first equation: \\(x = 64 + 2 = 66\\). Solving the second equation: \\(x = -64 + 2 = -62\\). \n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 66\\) and \\(x = -62\\). But wait, let me check these solutions in the original equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, check \\(x = 66\\). Plugging into the original equation: \\(\\sqrt[3]{(66)^2 - 4*66 + 4}\\). Let's compute the expression inside the cube root: \\(66^2 = 4356\\), \\(4*66 = 264\\), so \\(4356 - 264 + 4 = 4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. Then, the cube root of 4096 is 16, which matches the right side. So, that works. \n\nNow check \\(x = -62\\). Plugging into the original equation: \\(\\sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4*(-62) + 4}\\). Compute each term: \\((-62)^2 = 3844\\), \\(4*(-62) = -248\\), so adding those: 3844 - (-248) + 4 = 3844 + 248 + 4 = 4106. Then, the cube root of 4106. Wait, 4106 is not a perfect cube. Let me check 16^3 is 4096, 17^3 is 4913. So, 4106 is between 16^3 and 17^3, so its cube root is not an integer. But the original equation had the cube root equal to 16, which is an integer. So, if the expression inside the cube root is 4106, then the cube root of 4106 is not 16. Therefore, \\(x = -62\\) is not a valid solution. \n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 66\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps again. When I cubed both sides, I had \\((x - 2)^2 = 4096\\). Then, taking square roots, I considered both positive and negative roots, leading to \\(x - 2 = 64\\) or \\(x - 2 = -64\\), so \\(x = 66\\) or \\(x = -62\\). Then, checking both, only \\(x = 66\\) works. So, the answer is \\(x = 66\\). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more. If \\(x = 66\\), then the expression inside the cube root is 4096, cube root of 4096 is 16. If \\(x = -62\\), the expression inside is 4106, cube root of 4106 is not 16. So, only \\(x = 66\\) is valid. \n\nTherefore, the solution is \\(\\boxed{66}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\), we start by simplifying the expression inside the cube root. \n\nFirst, we recognize that \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\) is a perfect square:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = 4096\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we consider both the positive and negative roots:\n\\[\n|x - 2| = 64\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n1. \\(x - 2 = 64\\)\n2. \\(x - 2 = -64\\)\n\nSolving these equations, we find:\n1. \\(x = 64 + 2 = 66\\)\n2. \\(x = -64 + 2 = -62\\)\n\nWe check both solutions in the original equation:\n- For \\(x = 66\\), the expression inside the cube root is \\(4096\\), and \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096} = 16\\), which is valid.\n- For \\(x = -62\\), the expression inside the cube root is \\(4106\\), and \\(\\sqrt[3]{4106} \\neq 16\\), which is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid solution is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]", "answer": "66"}

Hmm, that's a product of four cosines, each with angles that are powers of 2. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using trigonometric identities. Maybe I can use the identity for the product of cosines, which is similar to the formula for the product of sines. Let me recall that identity. For example, the product of cosines can be related to the sine of a multiple angle. Specifically, the formula for the product of cosines is:\n\ncos A cos B cos C ... = [sin(2A) sin(2B) ...] / [2^{n-1} sin(2A) sin(2B) ...]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for the product of cosines in terms of sine functions. Let me try to recall.\n\nAnother approach is to use complex exponentials. Since cos θ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2. So, if I write each cosine term as (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2, then the product becomes:\n\n[ (e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15}) / 2 ] * [ (e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15}) / 2 ] * [ (e^{i8π/15} + e^{-i8π/15}) / 2 ] * [ (e^{i16π/15} + e^{-i16π/15}) / 2 ]\n\nMultiplying all these together, the product will be:\n\n[ (e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15})(e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15})(e^{i8π/15} + e^{-i8π/15})(e^{i16π/15} + e^{-i16π/15}) ] / 2^4\n\nSimplifying the denominator: 16.\n\nNow, the numerator is the product of four terms. Let's expand this product. Each term is a product of two exponentials. So, for example, the first term is e^{i2π/15} * e^{i4π/15} = e^{i6π/15} = e^{i2π/5}, and similarly, the second term is e^{-i2π/15} * e^{-i4π/15} = e^{-i6π/15} = e^{-i2π/5}, and so on. Wait, but actually, each term is a product of two exponentials. Let me check:\n\nFirst term: e^{i2π/15} * e^{i4π/15} = e^{i(2π/15 + 4π/15)} = e^{i6π/15} = e^{i2π/5}\n\nSecond term: e^{-i2π/15} * e^{-i4π/15} = e^{-i6π/15} = e^{-i2π/5}\n\nThird term: e^{i8π/15} * e^{i16π/15} = e^{i(8π/15 + 16π/15)} = e^{i24π/15} = e^{i8π/5}\n\nFourth term: e^{-i8π/15} * e^{-i16π/15} = e^{-i24π/15} = e^{-i8π/5}\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n[ e^{i2π/5} * e^{-i2π/5} * e^{i8π/5} * e^{-i8π/5} ] / 16\n\nSimplify each pair:\n\ne^{i2π/5} * e^{-i2π/5} = e^{i0} = 1\n\ne^{i8π/5} * e^{-i8π/5} = e^{i0} = 1\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 1 * 1 = 1, so the entire product is 1 / 16. But wait, that can't be right. Because the product of cosines is supposed to be a positive number, but 1/16 is positive. However, the product of four cosines, each of which is between -1 and 1, so the product should be between -1 and 1. But 1/16 is positive, so that's okay. But is this the correct answer?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, expanding the product:\n\n[ (e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15})(e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15})(e^{i8π/15} + e^{-i8π/15})(e^{i16π/15} + e^{-i16π/15}) ]\n\nEach term is a product of two exponentials. Let's compute each product:\n\nFirst pair: e^{i2π/15} * e^{i4π/15} = e^{i6π/15} = e^{i2π/5}\n\nSecond pair: e^{-i2π/15} * e^{-i4π/15} = e^{-i6π/15} = e^{-i2π/5}\n\nThird pair: e^{i8π/15} * e^{i16π/15} = e^{i24π/15} = e^{i8π/5}\n\nFourth pair: e^{-i8π/15} * e^{-i16π/15} = e^{-i24π/15} = e^{-i8π/5}\n\nSo, the numerator is e^{i2π/5} * e^{-i2π/5} * e^{i8π/5} * e^{-i8π/5} = e^{i0} * e^{i0} = 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, the entire product is 1 / 16. But that seems too straightforward. However, the problem is that when we expand the product of cosines, we might be missing something. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the identity for the product of cosines. For example, the product of cosines can be related to the sine of a multiple angle. Let me recall that:\n\ncos A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)] / 2\n\nBut here we have four cosines. Maybe we can pair them up. Let's try:\n\nFirst, pair cos(2π/15) and cos(16π/15). Then pair cos(4π/15) and cos(8π/15). Let's compute each pair.\n\nFirst pair: cos(2π/15) * cos(16π/15) = [sin(2π/15 + 16π/15) + sin(2π/15 - 16π/15)] / 2\n\nSimplify the arguments:\n\n2π/15 + 16π/15 = 18π/15 = 6π/5\n\n2π/15 - 16π/15 = -14π/15\n\nSo, this pair becomes [sin(6π/5) + sin(-14π/15)] / 2\n\nSimilarly, the second pair: cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) = [sin(4π/15 + 8π/15) + sin(4π/15 - 8π/15)] / 2\n\nSimplify the arguments:\n\n4π/15 + 8π/15 = 12π/15 = 4π/5\n\n4π/15 - 8π/15 = -4π/15\n\nSo, this pair becomes [sin(4π/5) + sin(-4π/15)] / 2\n\nNow, let's compute each of these terms.\n\nFirst pair:\n\nsin(6π/5) = sin(π + π/5) = -sin(π/5)\n\nsin(-14π/15) = -sin(14π/15) = -sin(π - π/15) = -sin(π/15)\n\nSo, sin(6π/5) + sin(-14π/15) = -sin(π/5) - sin(π/15)\n\nTherefore, the first pair is [ -sin(π/5) - sin(π/15) ] / 2\n\nSecond pair:\n\nsin(4π/5) = sin(π - π/5) = sin(π/5)\n\nsin(-4π/15) = -sin(4π/15)\n\nSo, sin(4π/5) + sin(-4π/15) = sin(π/5) - sin(4π/15)\n\nTherefore, the second pair is [ sin(π/5) - sin(4π/15) ] / 2\n\nNow, multiply the two pairs together:\n\n[ (-sin(π/5) - sin(π/15)) / 2 ] * [ (sin(π/5) - sin(4π/15)) / 2 ]\n\nMultiply the numerators:\n\n(-sin(π/5) - sin(π/15))(sin(π/5) - sin(4π/15))\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= -sin(π/5) * sin(π/5) + sin(π/5) * sin(4π/15) - sin(π/15) * sin(π/5) + sin(π/15) * sin(4π/15)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -sin²(π/5) + sin(π/5) sin(4π/15) - sin(π/5) sin(4π/15) + sin(π/15) sin(4π/15)\n\nThe middle two terms cancel out:\n\n= -sin²(π/5) + sin(π/15) sin(4π/15)\n\nSo, the product becomes [ -sin²(π/5) + sin(π/15) sin(4π/15) ] / 4\n\nNow, we need to compute sin(π/15) sin(4π/15). Let's recall that sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2\n\nSo, sin(π/15) sin(4π/15) = [cos(π/15 - 4π/15) - cos(π/15 + 4π/15)] / 2\n\nSimplify the arguments:\n\ncos(-3π/15) - cos(5π/15) = cos(-π/5) - cos(π/3) = cos(π/5) - cos(π/3)\n\nTherefore, sin(π/15) sin(4π/15) = [cos(π/5) - cos(π/3)] / 2\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ -sin²(π/5) + (cos(π/5) - cos(π/3))/2 ] / 4\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute sin²(π/5). There is a known value for sin(π/5), which is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4. Therefore, sin²(π/5) = (sqrt(5) - 1)^2 / 16 = (5 - 2sqrt(5) + 1)/16 = (6 - 2sqrt(5))/16 = (3 - sqrt(5))/8\n\nSo, -sin²(π/5) = - (3 - sqrt(5))/8 = (-3 + sqrt(5))/8\n\nNext, compute (cos(π/5) - cos(π/3))/2. cos(π/5) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4, and cos(π/3) is 1/2. So:\n\n(cos(π/5) - cos(π/3)) / 2 = [ (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 - 1/2 ] / 2\n\nConvert 1/2 to quarters: 1/2 = 2/4\n\nSo, [ (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 - 2/4 ] / 2 = [ (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 ] / 2 = (sqrt(5) - 1)/8\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ (-3 + sqrt(5))/8 + (sqrt(5) - 1)/8 ] / 4\n\nCombine the numerators:\n\n[ (-3 + sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) - 1) / 8 ] / 4 = [ (-4 + 2sqrt(5)) / 8 ] / 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (-4 + 2sqrt(5)) / 8 ] * (1/4) = (-4 + 2sqrt(5)) / 32\n\nFactor out 2:\n\n= 2(-2 + sqrt(5)) / 32 = (-2 + sqrt(5)) / 16\n\nTherefore, the entire product is (-2 + sqrt(5))/16\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to find the product of cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). However, we have computed the product of the first two pairs, which gives (-2 + sqrt(5))/16. But we need to multiply this by the remaining two cosines, which are cos(8π/15) and cos(16π/15). Wait, but we already considered the first two pairs. Wait, no. Wait, the original product is four cosines: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), cos(16π/15). So, we have already computed the product of the first two pairs, which gives (-2 + sqrt", "answer": "\\frac{1}{16}"}

So, we have an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC. There's a point M on AM such that AM = 11, and another point D on AM with AD = 10. The angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. We need to find the length of the sides of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, so the base is BC, and the vertex is A. Point M is on AM, which is the altitude from A to BC, since in an isosceles triangle, the altitude, median, and angle bisector coincide. So, AM is the altitude, and M is the midpoint of BC.\n\nGiven that AM = 11, so the length of the altitude is 11. Then, point D is on AM such that AD = 10, so MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1. So, D is 1 unit away from A towards M.\n\nWe also know that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let's denote angle BAC as θ. Then, angle BDC = 3θ.\n\nSince ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal. Let's denote angle ABC = angle ACB = φ. Then, angle BAC = θ = 180° - 2φ.\n\nNow, let's consider triangle BDC. We know angle BDC = 3θ, and we need to relate this to the other angles in the triangle. Also, points B, D, C are colinear along AM, with D between A and M.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since AM is the altitude, which is vertical in this coordinate system, and M is the midpoint of BC. Let's set M at (0,0) as well, but wait, if AM is the altitude, then M is the foot of the altitude from A to BC. Wait, but if A is at (0,0), then M would be at (0,0), but that can't be. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, let's place point A at (0, h), where h is the length of AM, which is 11. Then, since M is the midpoint of BC, and AM is the altitude, BC is horizontal. Let's set point M at (0,0), so BC is the x-axis. Then, points B and C are at (-b, 0) and (b, 0) respectively, where b is the distance from M to B or C. Then, point A is at (0, h) = (0, 11).\n\nNow, point D is on AM such that AD = 10. Since AM is from (0,11) to (0,0), moving down 10 units from A would place D at (0, 11 - 10) = (0, 1). So, D is at (0,1).\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of points B and C. Since AB = AC, and A is at (0,11), B is at (-b, 0), and C is at (b, 0). The distance from A to B is sqrt((b)^2 + (11 - 0)^2) = sqrt(b² + 121). Since AB = AC, that's correct.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle BDC. Let's compute the coordinates of points B, D, and C. B is (-b, 0), D is (0,1), and C is (b, 0).\n\nFirst, let's compute the vectors for angle BDC. The angle at D between points B, D, and C. So, vectors DB and DC.\n\nVector DB is from D to B: (-b - 0, 0 - 1) = (-b, -1)\n\nVector DC is from D to C: (b - 0, 0 - 1) = (b, -1)\n\nThe angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC. We can use the dot product formula to find this angle.\n\nThe dot product of DB and DC is (-b)(b) + (-1)(-1) = -b² + 1\n\nThe magnitudes of DB and DC are both sqrt(b² + 1), since both vectors have components (-b, -1) and (b, -1).\n\nSo, the cosine of angle BDC is ( -b² + 1 ) / ( (sqrt(b² + 1))^2 ) = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nGiven that angle BDC = 3θ, where θ is angle BAC. Let's express θ in terms of b. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angle BAC is θ, and angles at B and C are φ = (180° - θ)/2.\n\nWe can use the Law of Sines in triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, AB = AC = sqrt(b² + 121), BC = 2b. So, by Law of Sines:\n\nAB / sin φ = BC / sin θ\n\nBut AB = AC = sqrt(b² + 121), BC = 2b, and sin φ = sin( (180° - θ)/2 ) = sin(90° - θ/2 ) = cos(θ/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(b² + 121) / cos(θ/2 ) = 2b / sin θ\n\nBut sin θ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(b² + 121) / cos(θ/2 ) = 2b / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) = 2b / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) = b / sin(θ/2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt(b² + 121) / cos(θ/2 ) = b / sin(θ/2 )\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nsqrt(b² + 121) * sin(θ/2 ) = b * cos(θ/2 )\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(b² + 121) * sin²(θ/2 ) = b² cos²(θ/2 )\n\nDivide both sides by cos²(θ/2 ):\n\n(b² + 121) * tan²(θ/2 ) = b²\n\nSo,\n\ntan²(θ/2 ) = b² / (b² + 121 )\n\nTherefore,\n\ntan(θ/2 ) = b / sqrt(b² + 121 )\n\nBut we also have from the dot product formula:\n\ncos(3θ) = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nBut we need to relate this to θ. Let's recall that cos(3θ) can be expressed in terms of cos θ using the triple angle formula:\n\ncos(3θ) = 4 cos³ θ - 3 cos θ\n\nBut we need to express cos θ in terms of b. Let's recall that in triangle ABC, cos θ = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2 AB AC )\n\nBut AB = AC = sqrt(b² + 121 ), BC = 2b\n\nSo,\n\ncos θ = ( (b² + 121 ) + (b² + 121 ) - (4b² ) ) / (2 (b² + 121 ) )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2(b² + 121 ) - 4b² = 2b² + 242 - 4b² = -2b² + 242\n\nDenominator: 2(b² + 121 )\n\nSo,\n\ncos θ = (-2b² + 242 ) / (2(b² + 121 )) = (-b² + 121 ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos θ = (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nSo, we have cos θ = (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nNow, we can use the triple angle formula for cos(3θ):\n\ncos(3θ) = 4 cos³ θ - 3 cos θ\n\nBut we also have cos(3θ) = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nSo,\n\n4 cos³ θ - 3 cos θ = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nLet me substitute cos θ = (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nLet me compute cos³ θ:\n\n[ (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 ) ]³\n\nSimilarly, 3 cos θ = 3 * (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nSo,\n\n4 * [ (121 - b² )³ / (b² + 121 )³ ] - 3 * [ (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 ) ] = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nLet me factor out 1/(b² + 121 )³ from the left side:\n\n[ 4(121 - b² )³ - 3(b² + 121 )²(121 - b² ) ] / (b² + 121 )³ = ( -b² + 1 ) / (b² + 1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (b² + 121 )³:\n\n4(121 - b² )³ - 3(b² + 121 )²(121 - b² ) = ( -b² + 1 )(b² + 121 )³\n\nThis looks very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we have cos θ = (121 - b² ) / (b² + 121 )\n\nLet me denote x = b². Then,\n\ncos θ = (121 - x ) / (x + 121 )\n\nSo, cos θ = (121 - x ) / (x + 121 )\n\nLet me compute cos(3θ) using the triple angle formula:\n\ncos(3θ) = 4 cos³ θ - 3 cos θ\n\nSubstitute cos θ = (121 - x ) / (x + 121 )\n\nSo,\n\ncos(3θ) = 4 [ (121 - x ) / (x + 121 ) ]³ - 3 [ (121 - x ) / (x + 121 ) ]\n\nBut we also have cos(3θ) = ( -x + 1 ) / (x + 1 )\n\nSo,\n\n4 [ (121 - x )³ / (x + 121 )³ ] - 3 [ (121 - x ) / (x + 121 ) ] = ( -x + 1 ) / (x + 1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (x + 121 )³ to eliminate denominators:\n\n4(121 - x )³ - 3(121 - x )(x + 121 )² = ( -x + 1 )(x + 121 )³\n\nThis is still quite complex, but maybe we can factor terms.\n\nLet me denote y = 121 - x. Then, x = 121 - y. Let's substitute:\n\n4y³ - 3y(121 - y + 121 )² = ( - (121 - y ) + 1 )( (121 - y ) + 121 )³\n\nSimplify:\n\n4y³ - 3y(242 - y )² = ( -120 + y )(242 - y )³\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe expanding both sides would help.\n\nFirst, compute the left side:\n\n4y³ - 3y(242 - y )²\n\nFirst, expand (242 - y )²:\n\n= 242² - 2*242*y + y²\n\n= 58564 - 484y + y²\n\nSo,\n\n3y(242 - y )² = 3y(58564 - 484y + y² ) = 3y*58564 - 3y*484y + 3y*y² = 175692y - 1452y² + 3y³\n\nTherefore, left side:\n\n4y³ - (175692y - 1452y² + 3y³ ) = 4y³ -175692y +1452y² -3y³ = (4y³ -3y³ ) +1452y² -175692y = y³ +1452y² -175692y\n\nNow, compute the right side:\n\n( -120 + y )(242 - y )³\n\nFirst, compute (242 - y )³:\n\n= 242³ - 3*242²*y + 3*242*y² - y³\n\nCompute each term:\n\n242³: 242*242=58564, 58564*242=14137348\n\n242²=58564, so 3*242²=175692\n\n3*242=726, so 3*242*y²=726y²\n\nSo,\n\n(242 - y )³ = 14137348 -175692y +726y² - y³\n\nTherefore, right side:\n\n( -120 + y )(14137348 -175692y +726y² - y³ )\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n-120*14137348 + (-120)*(-175692y ) + (-120)*726y² + (-120)*(-y³ )\n\n+ y*14137348 + y*(-175692y ) + y*726y² + y", "answer": "11 \\sqrt{5} + 11"}

Izrazite svoj odgovor v intervalski notaciji.", "response": " \nOkay, so I need to solve the inequality -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving polynomials, it's often helpful to make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me think... \n\nSince the expression is x⁴ + 4x², maybe I can let y = x². That way, the expression becomes y² + 4y. That seems manageable. Let me try that substitution. \n\nSo, substituting y = x², the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. Now, I need to solve this compound inequality for y, and then find the corresponding x values. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the left part of the inequality: -4 < y² + 4y. Let's rearrange that. \n\ny² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, if I add 4 to both sides, that's y² + 4y + 4. That's a perfect square: (y + 2)². So, (y + 2)² > 0. \n\nBut (y + 2)² is always non-negative, right? Because a square is always non-negative. So, (y + 2)² ≥ 0. The only time it's equal to zero is when y + 2 = 0, which is y = -2. \n\nBut our inequality is (y + 2)² > 0. So, this is true for all y except y = -2. Therefore, the left part of the original inequality is satisfied for all real numbers y except y = -2. \n\nNow, moving on to the right part of the inequality: y² + 4y < 21. Let's rearrange that. \n\ny² + 4y - 21 < 0. Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. Let's solve the corresponding equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0 to find the critical points. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula: y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)] / 2 = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2. \n\nSo, the solutions are y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic factors as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0. \n\nTo determine where this product is negative, we can use a sign chart. The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. \n\nTesting intervals: \n\n1. y < -7: Let's pick y = -8. Then (y - 3) = -11, (y + 7) = -1. Product is (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0. \n\n2. -7 < y < 3: Let's pick y = 0. Then (y - 3) = -3, (y + 7) = 7. Product is (-3)(7) = -21 < 0. \n\n3. y > 3: Let's pick y = 4. Then (y - 3) = 1, (y + 7) = 11. Product is 11 > 0. \n\nTherefore, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 holds when y is between -7 and 3. \n\nBut remember, we already have from the left part that y ≠ -2. So, combining both parts, the solution for y is -7 < y < 3, excluding y = -2. \n\nBut wait, y = x², so y must be non-negative. Therefore, the interval for y is 0 ≤ y < 3, excluding y = -2. But since y is non-negative, the exclusion of y = -2 is redundant. So, the valid interval for y is 0 ≤ y < 3. \n\nTherefore, translating back to x, since y = x², we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. \n\nTaking square roots, we get 0 ≤ |x| < √3. Which means -√3 < x < √3. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other constraints. The original inequality is -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We found that x⁴ + 4x² is always greater than -4, which is true because x⁴ is non-negative and 4x² is non-negative, so their sum is non-negative, which is greater than -4. So, the left part is always satisfied. \n\nFor the right part, x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We found that x⁴ + 4x² < 21 when 0 ≤ x² < 3, which translates to -√3 < x < √3. \n\nTherefore, the solution set for x is all real numbers between -√3 and √3. \n\nBut let me verify this with some test values. \n\nFirst, check x = 0: x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. Then 0 is between -4 and 21, so it's okay. \n\nCheck x = 1: 1 + 4 = 5. 5 is between -4 and 21, okay. \n\nCheck x = √3: ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 4*3 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included. \n\nCheck x = 2: 16 + 16 = 32. 32 is not less than 21, so x = 2 is excluded. \n\nCheck x = -1: same as x = 1, 5. \n\nCheck x = -√3: same as x = √3, 21. Excluded. \n\nCheck x = 0.5: (0.5)^4 + 4*(0.5)^2 = 0.0625 + 4*0.25 = 0.0625 + 1 = 1.0625. That's between -4 and 21. \n\nCheck x = -0.5: same as x = 0.5, 1.0625. \n\nSo, the interval seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the solution is all real numbers x such that -√3 < x < √3. \n\nExpressed in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3). \n\nBut let me check if there are any other constraints. For example, when we substituted y = x², we assumed that y is non-negative, which it is. So, no additional constraints. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is all real numbers between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\), we start by substituting \\(y = x^2\\). This transforms the inequality into \\(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\\).\n\nFirst, we solve the left part of the inequality: \\(-4 < y^2 + 4y\\). Rearranging gives:\n\\[\ny^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \\implies (y + 2)^2 > 0\n\\]\nThis inequality holds for all \\(y \\neq -2\\).\n\nNext, we solve the right part of the inequality: \\(y^2 + 4y < 21\\). Rearranging gives:\n\\[\ny^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\n\\]\nSolving the quadratic equation \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 10}{2}\n\\]\nThis gives the roots \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\). The quadratic inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) holds for \\(-7 < y < 3\\).\n\nCombining these results, we have \\(0 \\leq y < 3\\) (since \\(y = x^2 \\geq 0\\)). Therefore, the solution for \\(y\\) is \\(0 \\leq y < 3\\).\n\nTranslating back to \\(x\\), since \\(y = x^2\\), we get:\n\\[\n0 \\leq x^2 < 3 \\implies -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\) is \\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}\\).", "answer": "(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})"}

Let me start by recalling some algebraic identities that might help here. I remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). Maybe that can be useful here. Let me write that down:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nGiven that \\( xyz = 4 \\), so \\( 3xyz = 12 \\). The second equation says \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). Therefore, substituting into the identity:\n\n\\( 4 - 12 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Notice that each term has two variables squared and one variable. Let me group them:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\)\n\nHmm, maybe factor by grouping.

Let me verify the steps.\n\nFirst, we started with the given equations and used the identity for \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \\). Then, substituted \\( xyz = 4 \\), so \\( 3xyz = 12 \\). Then, the equation became \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 12 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). Then, using \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \\), substituted into the equation, leading to \\( -8 = S(S^2 - 3P) \\). Then, the third equation was transformed into \\( SP = 24 \\). Then, substituting \\( SP = 24 \\) into the first equation gave \\( S^3 = 64 \\), so \\( S = 4 \\), then \\( P = 6 \\). \n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let me test with actual numbers. Suppose \\( S = 4 \\), \\( P = 6 \\), and \\( Q = 4 \\). Then, the third equation is \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\). Let me see if this holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find specific values for \\( x, y, z \\) that satisfy the equations. Let me try to find such numbers.\n\nSuppose \\( x, y, z \\) are roots of a cubic equation. Let me consider the cubic equation \\( t^3 - St^2 + P t - Q = 0 \\), which would be \\( t^3 - 4t^2 + 6t - 4 = 0 \\). Let me check if this factors.\n\nTry rational roots: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTesting t=1: 1 -4 +6 -4 = -1 ≠0\n\nt=2: 8 -16 +12 -4 = 0. Yes, t=2 is a root.\n\nSo factor out (t - 2):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide \\( t^3 -4t^2 +6t -4 \\) by (t - 2):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -4 | 6 | -4\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: -4 +2 = -2. Multiply by 2: -4. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-4) = 2. Multiply by 2: 4. Add to last coefficient: -4 +4 = 0. So the quotient is \\( t^2 -2t +2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as \\( (t - 2)(t^2 -2t +2) = 0 \\). The quadratic has discriminant 4 -8 = -4, so complex roots. Therefore, the roots are 2, and 1 ± i. So x, y, z are 2, 1 + i, 1 - i.\n\nLet me check if these satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, compute xyz:\n\n2*(1 + i)*(1 - i) = 2*(1 - i^2) = 2*(1 +1) = 4. Correct.\n\nCompute x^3 + y^3 + z^3:\n\nFirst, compute each cube:\n\nx^3 = 2^3 = 8\n\ny^3 = (1 + i)^3 = 1 + 3i + 3i^2 + i^3 = 1 + 3i -3 -i = (-2 + 2i)\n\nSimilarly, z^3 = (1 - i)^3 = 1 - 3i + 3i^2 -i^3 = 1 -3i -3 +i = (-2 -2i)\n\nSum: 8 + (-2 +2i) + (-2 -2i) = 8 -2 -2 +2i -2i = 4. Correct.\n\nThird equation: xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z\n\nCompute each term:\n\nxy^2: 2*(1 + i)^2 = 2*(1 + 2i + i^2) = 2*(1 +2i -1) = 2*(2i) = 4i\n\nx^2 y: (4)*(1 + i) = 4 +4i\n\nxz^2: 2*(1 -i)^2 = 2*(1 -2i +i^2) = 2*(1 -2i -1) = 2*(-2i) = -4i\n\nx^2 z: (4)*(1 -i) = 4 -4i\n\nyz^2: (1 +i)*(1 -i)^2 = (1 +i)*(1 -2i +i^2) = (1 +i)*(1 -2i -1) = (1 +i)*(-2i) = -2i -2i^2 = -2i +2\n\ny^2 z: (1 +i)^2*(1 -i) = (1 +2i +i^2)*(1 -i) = (1 +2i -1)*(1 -i) = (2i)*(1 -i) = 2i -2i^2 = 2i +2\n\nSum all terms:\n\n4i +4 + (-4i) +4 -4i + (-2i +2) +2i +2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4i -4i -4i -2i +2i = (-4i)\n\n4 +4 +2 +2 = 12\n\nSo total sum is 12i +12. But the third equation is supposed to be 12. However, the imaginary part is 12i, which is not zero. That suggests that my assumption of the roots is incorrect. Wait, but the problem states that the equations are satisfied, so maybe my assumption is wrong. But according to the problem, the equations are given, so maybe there is a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the equations are:\n\n1. xyz =4\n\n2. x^3 + y^3 + z^3 =4\n\n3. xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z =12\n\nSo if I take x=2, y=1+i, z=1-i, then the third equation does not hold. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong. So maybe there is a different set of roots that satisfy all three equations. But according to the problem, they are given, so perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the equations are given, so maybe the answer is 6. But according to the steps I took, I arrived at 6. But when I checked with the roots, the third equation didn't hold. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the third equation again.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, the key steps are to find the critical points where the numerator or denominator is zero, and then test the intervals between those points to see where the inequality holds. Also, we have to be careful about the denominator not being zero because division by zero is undefined. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the absolute value in the numerator, \\(|x^2 - 81|\\), can be simplified. Since \\(x^2 - 81\\) is a difference of squares, it factors into \\((x - 9)(x + 9)\\). So, \\(|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|\\). But since absolute value is always non-negative, the numerator is non-negative for all real numbers \\(x\\), except when the expression inside is zero. However, the inequality is strict (\\(< 0\\)), so we need the entire fraction to be negative. Since the numerator is non-negative, the denominator must be negative for the fraction to be negative. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to finding where the denominator \\(x^2 - 36x\\) is negative, provided that the numerator isn't zero (since division by zero is undefined). Wait, but the numerator is \\(|x^2 - 81|\\), which is zero when \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -9\\). So, those points are excluded from the solution set because the original inequality is strict. Therefore, the solution will be the intervals where the denominator is negative, excluding \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\).\n\nSo, let's focus on solving \\(x^2 - 36x < 0\\). Let's factor the denominator: \\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\\). So, the denominator is \\(x(x - 36)\\). To find where this is negative, we can use a sign chart. The critical points are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\). These divide the real number line into three intervals: \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 36)\\), and \\((36, \\infty)\\). Let's test each interval.\n\n1. For \\(x < 0\\), let's pick \\(x = -1\\). Then, \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x - 36 = -37\\). So, the denominator is \\((-1)(-37) = 37\\), which is positive. So, the denominator is positive in \\((-\\infty, 0)\\).\n\n2. For \\(0 < x < 36\\), let's pick \\(x = 18\\). Then, \\(x = 18\\) and \\(x - 36 = -18\\). So, the denominator is \\(18 \\times (-18) = -324\\), which is negative. So, the denominator is negative in \\((0, 36)\\).\n\n3. For \\(x > 36\\), let's pick \\(x = 40\\). Then, \\(x = 40\\) and \\(x - 36 = 4\\). So, the denominator is \\(40 \\times 4 = 160\\), which is positive. So, the denominator is positive in \\((36, \\infty)\\).\n\nTherefore, the denominator \\(x^2 - 36x\\) is negative in the interval \\((0, 36)\\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\). But since those points are already excluded from the interval \\((0, 36)\\), we don't need to worry about them here.\n\nBut wait, we also need to consider the numerator \\(|x^2 - 81|\\). The numerator is zero at \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\), so those points are excluded from the solution set. However, since the denominator is negative in \\((0, 36)\\), and the numerator is non-negative, the entire fraction is non-negative except at \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\). But since the inequality is strict (\\(< 0\\)), we need the fraction to be negative. Therefore, the solution is the interval where the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the numerator is zero. So, the solution is \\((0, 36)\\) excluding \\(x = 9\\). But wait, \\(x = 9\\) is in the interval \\((0, 36)\\), so we need to exclude it. Similarly, \\(x = -9\\) is not in \\((0, 36)\\), so we don't need to exclude it. Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 36)\\) excluding \\(x = 9\\).\n\nBut let me verify this. Let's test a value in \\((0, 9)\\), say \\(x = 1\\). Then, the denominator is \\(1 - 36 = -35\\), which is negative. The numerator is \\(|1 - 81| = 80\\), so the fraction is \\(80 / (-35) = -80/35\\), which is negative. So, that works. Another test in \\((9, 36)\\), say \\(x = 18\\). Denominator is \\(18 - 36 = -18\\), numerator is \\(|18^2 - 81| = |324 - 81| = 243\\). So, the fraction is \\(243 / (-18) = -13.5\\), which is negative. That works. Now, test \\(x = 10\\), which is in \\((0, 9)\\). Denominator is \\(10 - 36 = -26\\), numerator is \\(|100 - 81| = 19\\). So, the fraction is \\(19 / (-26) = -19/26\\), which is negative. So, that works. Now, test \\(x = 35\\), which is in \\((0, 36)\\). Denominator is \\(35 - 36 = -1\\), numerator is \\(|35^2 - 81| = |1225 - 81| = 1144\\). So, the fraction is \\(1144 / (-1) = -1144\\), which is negative. So, that works. Now, test \\(x = 36\\), which is excluded because the denominator is zero. Similarly, test \\(x = -10\\), which is in \\((0, 36)\\). Denominator is \\(-10 - 36 = -46\\), numerator is \\(|100 - 81| = 19\\). So, the fraction is \\(19 / (-46) = -19/46\\), which is negative. So, that works. Now, test \\(x = 0\\), which is excluded because the denominator is zero. Similarly, test \\(x = 36\\), which is excluded. So, all tests in the interval \\((0, 36)\\) work. Therefore, the solution is indeed \\((0, 36)\\) excluding \\(x = 9\\). But wait, \\(x = 9\\) is in \\((0, 36)\\), so we need to exclude it. Similarly, \\(x = -9\\) is not in \\((0, 36)\\), so we don't need to exclude it. Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 36) \\setminus \\{9\\}\\).\n\nBut let me check if there are any other points where the inequality could hold. For example, when the denominator is negative, the fraction is negative, which satisfies the inequality. But we need to make sure that the numerator isn't zero. Since the numerator is zero at \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\), and those points are excluded from the solution set, we don't need to consider them. Therefore, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 9.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other critical points. The numerator is zero at \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\), which are excluded. The denominator is zero at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 36\\), which are also excluded. So, the only points to exclude are \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -9\\). Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 36) \\setminus \\{9\\}\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a possibility that the inequality could hold in another interval. For example, if the denominator is positive, but the numerator is negative. But the numerator is non-negative, so the fraction is non-negative. Therefore, the only way the fraction is negative is if the denominator is negative. Therefore, the solution is indeed \\((0, 36) \\setminus \\{9\\}\\).\n\nBut let me check another point in \\((0, 9)\\), say \\(x = 1\\). As before, the fraction is negative. Another point in \\((9, 36)\\), say \\(x = 10\\), the fraction is negative. So, all points in \\((0, 36)\\) except \\(x = 9\\) work. Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 36) \\setminus \\{9\\}\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if \\(x = 9\\) is included in the solution. Since the inequality is strict (\\(< 0\\)), \\(x = 9\\) is excluded. Similarly, \\(x = -9\\) is excluded. Therefore, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 9.\n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake here. For example, when \\(x\\) is in \\((0, 9)\\), the denominator is negative, so the fraction is negative. When \\(x\\) is in \\((9, 36)\\), the denominator is negative, so the fraction is negative. When \\(x\\) is in \\((36, \\infty)\\), the denominator is positive, so the fraction is positive. When \\(x\\) is in \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), the denominator is positive, so the fraction is positive. Therefore, the only intervals where the fraction is negative are \\((0, 9)\\) and \\((9, 36)\\). But since the inequality is strict, we exclude the endpoints. Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check \\(x = 9\\). If \\(x = 9\\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined. Therefore, \\(x = 9\\) is excluded. Similarly, \\(x = -9\\) is excluded. Therefore, the solution is \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\nBut let me verify with another test. Let's take \\(x = 10\\), which is in \\((9, 36)\\). Denominator is \\(100 - 360 = -260\\), numerator is \\(|100 - 81| = 19\\). So, the fraction is \\(19 / (-260) = -19/260\\), which is negative. Correct. If I take \\(x = 10\\), which is in \\((9, 36)\\), the fraction is negative. If I take \\(x = 10\\), which is in \\((0, 9)\\), the fraction is negative. If I take \\(x = 10\\), which is in \\((9, 36)\\), the fraction is negative. So, all points in \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\) work. Therefore, the solution is indeed \\((0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a point where the denominator is negative but the numerator is also negative. For example, if \\(x\\) is in \\((0, 9)\\), the denominator is negative, and the numerator is non-negative. If \\(x\\) is in \\((9, 36)\\), the denominator is negative, and the numerator is non-negative. If \\(x\\) is in \\((36, \\infty)\\), the denominator is positive, and the numerator is non-negative. If \\(x\\) is in \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), the denominator is positive, and the numerator is non-negative. Therefore, the only intervals where the fraction is negative are \\((0, 9)\\) and \\((9, 36)\\).

If it's a right-angled triangle at T, then angles at R and S must add up to 90 degrees. So angle R + angle S = 90 degrees. The problem says angle R is 2/5, which is a fraction.

Najdi $a+b$.", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the largest integer ratio of the inradius to the circumradius of a triangle inscribed in the parabola \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). The answer should be in the form \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers with \\( a \\) not divisible by any square number except 1, and then we need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of parabolas and triangles inscribed in them. The parabola given is \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). Let me rewrite that to make it clearer: \\( y = \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). So, it's a parabola opening upwards with vertex at \\( (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\).\n\nI remember that for a parabola \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the focus is at \\( (h, k + \\frac{1}{4a}) \\) and the directrix is \\( y = k - \\frac{1}{4a} \\). But here, the parabola is written in a different form. Let me check if it's a standard parabola. The standard form is \\( y = \\frac{1}{4p}(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( p \\) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing this to our equation, \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), so \\( a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), \\( h = 0 \\), \\( k = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Then, the focus would be at \\( (0, k + \\frac{1}{4a}) = (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}) \\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4a} = \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\). So, the focus is at \\( (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}) \\). Let's rationalize the denominators:\n\n\\( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), and \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\) is already rationalized. So, the focus is at \\( (0, -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}) = (0, -\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}) = (0, -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4}) \\).\n\nThe directrix is \\( y = k - \\frac{1}{4a} = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), so the directrix is \\( -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = -\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = -\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\).\n\nSo, the directrix is the horizontal line \\( y = -\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\).\n\nNow, for a triangle inscribed in a parabola, the inradius and circumradius can be related to the coordinates of the triangle's vertices. Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, the triangle is likely symmetric as well. So, maybe the triangle is an isosceles triangle with its vertex at the vertex of the parabola? Wait, but the vertex of the parabola is at \\( (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\). If the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis, then the other two vertices would be at \\( (p, q) \\) and \\( (-p, q) \\), where \\( q \\) is some value. But since the parabola is \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), the y-coordinate of the parabola at \\( x = p \\) is \\( \\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). So, if the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis, then the third vertex is at \\( (0, q) \\), but since the parabola is below the vertex at \\( (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\), the y-coordinate \\( q \\) must be less than \\( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). However, if the triangle is inscribed in the parabola, the third vertex must lie on the parabola. So, the third vertex is \\( (0, q) \\), but since the parabola is below the vertex, \\( q \\) must be less than \\( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). But if the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis, then the other two vertices are at \\( (p, \\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\) and \\( (-p, \\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\). But the third vertex is at \\( (0, q) \\). So, the three vertices are \\( (0, q) \\), \\( (p, \\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\), and \\( (-p, \\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\). But since the triangle is inscribed in the parabola, all three points must lie on the parabola. So, the y-coordinate of the third vertex must satisfy the parabola equation. Let's check:\n\nFor the third vertex \\( (0, q) \\), substituting into the parabola equation:\n\n\\( q = \\frac{0^2}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). But the third vertex is supposed to be below the vertex of the parabola, so \\( q \\) must be less than \\( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Therefore, this suggests that the third vertex is at the vertex of the parabola, which is not possible for a triangle. Therefore, the triangle cannot be symmetric about the y-axis. Hmm, so maybe the triangle is not symmetric about the y-axis? That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is not symmetric about the y-axis, but the inradius and circumradius can still be related to the coordinates of the vertices. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is such that two of its vertices lie on the parabola, and the third vertex is somewhere else. But since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, maybe the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Wait, but if the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis, then the third vertex must also lie on the parabola. But as we saw, the third vertex would have to be at the vertex of the parabola, which is not possible. Therefore, the triangle cannot be symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, the triangle is not symmetric about the y-axis, but perhaps it's symmetric with respect to some other axis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is such that two of its vertices are on the parabola, and the third vertex is somewhere else. But since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, maybe the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.

I need to find the inverse function values for 0 and 6, then add them together. Hmm, inverse functions can be tricky, but maybe I can figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the inverse function, \\( f^{-1}(y) \\), is the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\). So, to find \\( f^{-1}(0) \\), I need to solve the equation \\( f(x) = 0 \\), and similarly for \\( f^{-1}(6) \\). Then add those two solutions together. \n\nLet me start with \\( f^{-1}(0) \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined piecewise. So, I need to check both cases: when \\( x \\leq 3 \\) and when \\( x > 3 \\). \n\nFirst case: \\( x \\leq 3 \\). Then \\( f(x) = 3 - x \\). Setting this equal to 0: \\( 3 - x = 0 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), I get \\( x = 3 \\). But wait, the condition here is \\( x \\leq 3 \\). So, \\( x = 3 \\) is valid here. \n\nSecond case: \\( x > 3 \\). Then \\( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \\). Setting this equal to 0: \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \\). Let me factor this equation. \n\nFirst, factor out an \\( x \\): \\( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \\). So, either \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \\). But \\( x = 0 \\) is not in the domain \\( x > 3 \\), so we can ignore that. \n\nNow, solve \\( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \\). Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: \\( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \\). Let's factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, -3 and 1. So, \\( (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \\). Therefore, solutions are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). \n\nBut in this case, the domain is \\( x > 3 \\), so \\( x = 3 \\) is not valid here. The other solution is \\( x = -1 \\), which is also not in the domain \\( x > 3 \\). Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. \n\nSo, the only solution for \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is \\( x = 3 \\). Therefore, \\( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \\). \n\nNow, moving on to \\( f^{-1}(6) \\). Again, I need to solve \\( f(x) = 6 \\). Let's check both cases. \n\nFirst case: \\( x \\leq 3 \\). Then \\( f(x) = 3 - x \\). Setting this equal to 6: \\( 3 - x = 6 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), subtract 3: \\( -x = 3 \\), so \\( x = -3 \\). But \\( x = -3 \\) is in the domain \\( x \\leq 3 \\), so this is valid. \n\nSecond case: \\( x > 3 \\). Then \\( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \\). Setting this equal to 6: \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \\). Let's rearrange: \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \\). Multiply both sides by -1: \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0 \\). Hmm, this cubic equation might be a bit tricky.

Let's test x = 1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0. x = -1: -1 - 2 + 3 + 6 = 6 ≠ 0. x = 2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root. So, we can factor out (x - 2). Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. \n\nUsing synthetic division with root 2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -2 | -3 | 6\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: -2 + 2 = 0.\n\nMultiply by 2: 0. Add to next coefficient: -3 + 0 = -3.\n\nMultiply by 2: -6. Add to last coefficient: 6 + (-6) = 0. Perfect. So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x^2 + 0x - 3) = (x - 2)(x^2 - 3). \n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 2 and x = ±√3. But since we are in the domain x > 3, x = 2 is not valid here. The other roots are x = √3 ≈ 1.732 and x = -√3 ≈ -1.732, both of which are less than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. \n\nTherefore, the only solution for \\( f(x) = 6 \\) is \\( x = -3 \\). Therefore, \\( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \\). \n\nNow, adding the two results: \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \\). \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. \n\nFor \\( f^{-1}(0) \\), solving \\( 3 - x = 0 \\) gives x = 3, which is valid. For \\( f^{-1}(6) \\), solving \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \\) gives x = -3, which is valid. So, adding 3 and -3 gives 0. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake here? Let me verify each step again. \n\nFirst inverse function: \n\n- For x ≤ 3: f(x) = 3 - x. Setting to 0 gives x = 3. Valid. \n\n- For x > 3: f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. Setting to 0 gives x = 3 (invalid) and x = -1 (invalid). So, only x = 3. \n\nSecond inverse function: \n\n- For x ≤ 3: f(x) = 3 - x. Setting to 6 gives x = -3. Valid. \n\n- For x > 3: f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. Setting to 6 gives x = -3 (invalid) and x = √3 (invalid). So, only x = -3. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \\), we need to solve the equations \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 6 \\) separately.\n\n**Finding \\( f^{-1}(0) \\):**\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( x \\leq 3 \\)**\n   \\[\n   f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \\implies x = 3\n   \\]\n   This solution is valid since \\( x = 3 \\leq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( x > 3 \\)**\n   \\[\n   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \\implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving \\( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 3 \\) or \\( x = -1 \\).

The problem is about finding the distance from point P to the octahedral face that is opposite to P. The octahedron is a regular one, so all edges are equal, and all faces are equilateral triangles. The given coordinates of P are (1.2, 1.5, 1), and the octahedron has vertices at A(1,0,0), B(-1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,-1,0), E(0,0,1), F(0,0,-1). The edges of the octahedron are all of length sqrt(2), since the distance between any two adjacent vertices is sqrt((1-(-1))^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(4) = 2. Wait, but in a regular octahedron, the edge length is sqrt(2) times the distance from the center to a vertex. Wait, maybe I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, in a regular octahedron, the distance from the center to a vertex is 1, and the edge length is sqrt(2). So, the coordinates of the vertices are (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). So, the octahedron is centered at the origin, with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1).

I need to figure out the ratio of the number of times Jen and Jack went to the pool based on their heights. The problem says that Jen's height is 200 cm and Jack's is 150 cm. The question is asking for the ratio of their heights, which would be Jen's height to Jack's height. \n\nFirst, let me recall that when they talk about the number of times they went to the pool, it's related to their strength. The formula they mentioned is that the force required to lift an object is equal to the mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. Since both Jen and Jack are using the same pool, the acceleration due to gravity is the same for both. Therefore, the force required to lift them would be directly proportional to their mass. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the force required to lift an object is equal to the mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. So, if they are using the same pool, the acceleration due to gravity is the same for both. Therefore, the force required to lift them would be proportional to their mass. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the ratio of the number of times they went to the pool. Since the force required is proportional to their mass, and the force they can apply is the same (since they are using the same pool), the number of times they went to the pool should be inversely proportional to their mass. Because if the force is the same, the number of times you can go to the pool (i.e., the number of times you can lift the object) would be inversely proportional to the mass. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the force required to lift the object is equal to the mass times gravity, then if the force is the same, the mass must be inversely proportional to the number of times you can lift the object. So, if Jen's mass is 200g and Jack's is 150g, then the ratio of their heights (which are proportional to their masses) would be 200:150, which simplifies to 4:3. Therefore, the ratio of the number of times they went to the pool would be 4:3. \n\nBut let me verify this. Suppose Jen can lift the object 4 times, and Jack can lift it 3 times. Then the total force Jen applies would be 4 times the force per lift, and Jack would be 3 times. But since the force per lift is the same, the total force would be proportional to the number of times. So, if Jen's mass is 200g and Jack's is 150g, then the ratio of their heights (which are proportional to their masses) is 200:150, which simplifies to 4:3. Therefore, the ratio of the number of times they went to the pool is 4:3. \n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of the force required, since the force is the same, the number of times they can go to the pool is inversely proportional to their mass. So, Jen's mass is 200g, Jack's is 150g. Therefore, Jen can go 150/200 = 0.75 times as many times as Jack. So, the ratio is 4:3. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4:3. \n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"the ratio of the number of times Jen and Jack went to the pool\". Since the force required is the same, the number of times they went to the pool is inversely proportional to their mass. Therefore, the ratio is 4:3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the ratio of their heights, which is 200:150, which simplifies to 4:3. So, both approaches lead to the same answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem says \"the ratio of the number of times Jen and Jack went to the pool\". Since the force required is the same, the number of times they went to the pool is inversely proportional to their mass. Therefore, the ratio is 4:3. \n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of the number of times they can lift the object, then since the force is the same, the number of times is inversely proportional to their mass. Therefore, Jen's number of times is 150/200 = 0.75 times Jack's. So, the ratio is 4:3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4:3. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose Jen's height is 200 cm, Jack's is 150 cm. The ratio of their heights is 200:150, which simplifies to 4:3. Therefore, the ratio of the number of times they went to the pool is 4:3. \n\nYes, that seems to be the case. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4:3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ratio of the number of times Jen and Jack went to the pool is \\boxed{4:3}.\n</think>\n\nJen's height is 200 cm and Jack's height is 150 cm.

Then, add those two numbers together and get the result in base 10. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling how to convert numbers between different bases. \n\nFirst, converting from base 10 to another base, like base 7 or base 8, involves dividing the number by the new base repeatedly and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the new base. \n\nSo, for example, to convert 629 to base 7, I need to divide 629 by 7, write down the remainder, then divide the quotient by 7 again, and so on until the quotient is 0. Then, the remainders read from last to first will be the digits in base 7. Similarly for base 8. \n\nLet me try that. Starting with base 7. \n\nFirst division: 629 ÷ 7. Let's see, 7 times 89 is 623, because 7*80=560, 7*9=63, so 560+63=623. Then 629 - 623 = 6. So the remainder is 6. \n\nNow, take the quotient 89 and divide by 7. 7*12=84, so 89-84=5. Remainder 5. \n\nNext, quotient 12 divided by 7: 7*1=7, remainder 5. \n\nQuotient 1 divided by 7: 7*0=0, remainder 1. \n\nQuotient 0, so we stop. \n\nSo the remainders, read from last to first, are 1, 5, 5, 6. Therefore, 629 in base 7 is 1556. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7^1 + 6*7^0. \n\n7^3 is 343, 5*49=245, 5*7=35, 6*1=6. Adding those: 343+245=588, 588+35=623, 623+6=629. Yes, that's correct. \n\nNow, converting 629 to base 8. \n\nDivide 629 by 8. 8*78=624, remainder 5. \n\nQuotient 78 divided by 8: 8*9=72, remainder 6. \n\nQuotient 9 divided by 8: 8*1=8, remainder 1. \n\nQuotient 1 divided by 8: 8*0=0, remainder 1. \n\nSo the remainders are 1, 1, 6, 5. Reading from last to first: 1, 1, 6, 5. Therefore, 629 in base 8 is 1165. \n\nLet me verify that. 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8 +5. \n\n8^3 is 512, 8^2 is 64, 8 is 8, 5 is 5. So 512+64=576, 576+48=624, 624+5=629. Correct. \n\nSo now, we have 629 in base 7 as 1556 and in base 8 as 1165. \n\nNext, we need to add these two numbers together. But they are in different bases. So we can't directly add them. We need to convert both to base 10 first, add them, and then convert the result back to base 10. Wait, but the problem says to add them in base 7 and base 8, but the result should be in base 10. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is to add the two numbers as they are in their respective bases, and then present the sum in base 10. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"Koliko enakih neste nestevah nestevah vredstitevah nestevah v b dailyne 7 in b dailyne 8? Na primer, 121 trines v 3 in 5 trines bi imela eno nestek skupno.\" \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to add the two numbers 629 (base 7) and 629 (base 8) and present the sum in base 10. That seems possible. \n\nSo, first, convert both numbers to base 10, add them, and then present the result. \n\nSo, converting 1556 (base 7) to base 10. \n\n1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7 +6. \n\n7^3 is 343, 5*49=245, 5*7=35, 6=6. \n\n343+245=588, 588+35=623, 623+6=629. So that's correct. \n\nThen, converting 1165 (base 8) to base 10. \n\n1*8^3 +1*8^2 +6*8 +5. \n\n8^3=512, 8^2=64, 8=8, 5=5. \n\n512+64=576, 576+48=624, 624+5=629. \n\nSo both numbers convert to 629 in base 10. \n\nTherefore, adding them together: 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nSo the sum in base 10 is 1258. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Koliko enakih nestevah nestevah vredstitevah nestevah v b dailyne 7 in b dailyne 8? Na primer, 121 trines v 3 in 5 trines bi imela eno nestek skupno.\" \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to add the two numbers as they are in their respective bases, and present the sum in base 10. So, yes, 629 (base7) + 629 (base8) = 1258 (base10). \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nWait, 1556 (base7) is 629 (base10). 1165 (base8) is 629 (base10). So adding them gives 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nBut the problem says \"Koliko enakih nestevah nestevah vredstitevah nestevah v b dailyne 7 in b dailyne 8? Na primer, 121 trines v 3 in 5 trines bi imela eno nestek skupno.\" \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to add the two numbers as they are in their respective bases, and present the sum in base 10. So, yes, 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nBut let me check if there's a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is to add the two numbers as they are in their respective bases, and present the sum in base 10. So, yes, 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to add the two numbers as they are in their respective bases, and present the sum in base 10. So, yes, 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nWait, 1556 (base7) is 629 (base10). 1165 (base8) is 629 (base10). So adding them gives 629 + 629 = 1258. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nBut let me check if there's a different way to add them. For example, if they were in base 10, but the problem says to add them in base 7 and base 8.

The question is asking how many times they rooked each other. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. The chess players are divided into two groups: 16 and 10. The 16 chess players are all rooked by the 10 checkers, and the 10 checkers are rooked by the 16 chess players. But there's a catch: the 16 chess players are not rooked by each other, and the 10 checkers are not rooked by each other. So, the rookings are only between the chess players and the checkers, not within the chess players or within the checkers. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"na srečanju\" which is in Catalan, so maybe it's in another language. But the key is that the chess players are divided into two groups: 16 and 10. The 16 chess players are rooked by the 10 checkers, and the 10 checkers are rooked by the 16 chess players. So, each of the 16 chess players rooked all 10 checkers, and each of the 10 checkers rooked all 16 chess players. \n\nBut the problem also mentions that the 16 chess players are not rooked by each other, and the 10 checkers are not rooked by each other. So, the rookings are only between the chess players and the checkers. So, the total number of rookings would be the number of times a chess player rooked a checker plus the number of times a checker rooked a chess player. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"na srečanju\" which is in Catalan, but the exact wording isn't provided. However, the key is that the chess players are divided into two groups: 16 and 10. So, the 16 chess players are rooked by the 10 checkers, and the 10 checkers are rooked by the 16 chess players. So, each chess player rooked all 10 checkers, and each checker rooked all 16 chess players. \n\nBut the problem is asking how many rookings there are in total. So, the total number of rookings would be the number of times a chess player rooked a checker plus the number of times a checker rooked a chess player. \n\nBut wait, each chess player rooked all 10 checkers, so that's 16 chess players * 10 checkers = 160 rookings. Similarly, each checker rooked all 16 chess players, so that's 10 checkers * 16 chess players = 160 rookings. So, total rookings would be 160 + 160 = 320. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"na srečanju\" which is in Catalan, but the exact wording isn't provided.

I need to find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\), which is \\( f(x-1) \\). The original polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is given as \\( 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \\). Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\). So, if I can figure out what \\( g(1) \\) is, that should give me the sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\). \n\nBut wait, \\( g(x) \\) is \\( f(x-1) \\). So, substituting \\( x-1 \\) into \\( f(x) \\), I need to compute \\( f(1) \\). Because if I set \\( x = 1 \\) in \\( g(x) \\), which is \\( f(x-1) \\), then \\( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is equal to \\( f(0) \\). That simplifies things a lot. Instead of expanding \\( f(x-1) \\) and then adding up all the coefficients, I can just plug in \\( x = 0 \\) into \\( f(x) \\). \n\nLet me check that. If I have a polynomial \\( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 \\), then the sum of the coefficients is \\( f(1) = a_n + a_{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 + a_0 \\). But in this case, \\( g(x) = f(x-1) \\), so when I evaluate \\( g(1) \\), it's \\( f(0) \\). That's correct. \n\nSo, instead of expanding \\( f(x-1) \\), which would be a quartic polynomial, I can just compute \\( f(0) \\). Let's do that. \n\nGiven \\( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \\), plugging in \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2 \\).\n\nWait, so the sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( -2 \\)? That seems straightforward. But let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand \\( f(x-1) \\) and then sum the coefficients. Let's try that to confirm. \n\nFirst, expand \\( f(x-1) \\):\n\n\\( f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2 \\).\n\nLet's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: \\( 3(x-1)^4 \\).

Svoj odgovor izrazite v najpreprostejši obliki z radikali.", "response": " \nOkay, so I need to find the point on the line y = 2x - 2 that is closest to the point (6, 0). Hmm, let me think. I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is along the perpendicular line. So maybe I should find the equation of the line that is perpendicular to y = 2x - 2 and passes through (6, 0), and then find their intersection point. That should give me the closest point. Let me try that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the slope of the given line y = 2x - 2 is 2. The slope of a line perpendicular to this would be the negative reciprocal, right? So that would be -1/2. So the equation of the perpendicular line passing through (6, 0) should be y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6). Simplifying that, it's y = (-1/2)x + 3. \n\nNow, I need to find the intersection point of the two lines: y = 2x - 2 and y = (-1/2)x + 3. To find where they meet, I can set the two equations equal to each other. So:\n\n2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3\n\nLet me solve for x. First, let's eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2 to make it easier. Multiply each term by 2:\n\n2*(2x - 2) = 2*(-1/2 x + 3)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x - 4 = -x + 6\n\nNow, let's get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Add x to both sides:\n\n4x + x - 4 = 6\n\nWhich is:\n\n5x - 4 = 6\n\nThen, add 4 to both sides:\n\n5x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 2\n\nNow that I have x = 2, I can substitute back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use y = 2x - 2:\n\ny = 2*(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nSo the intersection point is (2, 2). That should be the closest point on the line y = 2x - 2 to the point (6, 0). Let me verify this by calculating the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2). The distance formula is sqrt[(6 - 2)^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = sqrt[16 + 4] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5). \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if this is indeed the shortest distance. Let me think. The distance from a point to a line is given by the formula |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2), where Ax + By + C = 0 is the line. Let me confirm that with the given line y = 2x - 2. Rewriting it in standard form: 2x - y - 2 = 0. So A = 2, B = -1, C = -2. Then the distance from (6, 0) to the line is |2*6 + (-1)*0 - 2| / sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = |12 - 0 - 2| / sqrt(4 + 1) = |10| / sqrt(5) = 10 / sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5). Yep, that matches the previous result. So that confirms that the closest point is indeed (2, 2). \n\nI think that's all. The key was recognizing that the shortest distance is along the perpendicular, so finding the intersection of the two lines gives the closest point. Then verifying with the distance formula. I don't see any mistakes in the steps, so I think this is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe closest point is \\boxed{(2, 2)}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the point on the line \\( y = 2x - 2 \\) that is closest to the point \\( (6, 0) \\), we need to find the intersection of the line \\( y = 2x - 2 \\) with the perpendicular line passing through \\( (6, 0) \\).\n\n1. **Slope of the given line**: The slope of \\( y = 2x - 2 \\) is 2.\n2. **Slope of the perpendicular line**: The slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal, which is \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n3. **Equation of the perpendicular line**: Using the point-slope form, the equation is \\( y - 0 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 6) \\), simplifying to \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\).\n\n4. **Finding the intersection point**:\n   - Set the equations equal: \\( 2x - 2 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     2x - 2 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\\\\n     2x + \\frac{1}{2}x = 3 + 2 \\\\\n     \\frac{5}{2}x = 5 \\\\\n     x = 2\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) back into \\( y = 2x - 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verification using distance formula**:\n   - Distance from \\( (6, 0) \\) to \\( (2, 2) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(6 - 2)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n   - Using the distance formula for the line \\( 2x - y - 2 = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{|2(6) - 1(0) - 2|}{\\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{5}} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n\nThe closest point is \\(\\boxed{(2, 2)}\\).", "answer": "2\\sqrt{5}"}

Let me try to factor the polynomial. \n\nLooking at \\( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 \\), I notice that it's a quartic with no \\( x^2 \\) term. Maybe I can use substitution to reduce the degree. Let me set \\( y = x + 0.5 \\), which is a common technique for quartic equations. Let's try that. \n\nLet \\( y = x + 0.5 \\), so \\( x = y - 0.5 \\). Substitute into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(y - 0.5)^4 + 2(y - 0.5)^3 + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\nFirst, \\( (y - 0.5)^4 \\):\n\n\\[\n(y - 0.5)^4 = y^4 - 2 \\cdot 0.5 y^3 + 3 \\cdot (0.5)^2 y^2 - 4 \\cdot (0.5)^3 y + (0.5)^4\n\\]\n\\[\n= y^4 - y^3 + 0.75 y^2 - 0.5 y + 0.0625\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( 2(y - 0.5)^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n2(y - 0.5)^3 = 2(y^3 - 3 \\cdot 0.5 y^2 + 3 \\cdot (0.5)^2 y - (0.5)^3)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2(y^3 - 1.5 y^2 + 0.75 y - 0.125)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2y^3 - 3 y^2 + 1.5 y - 0.25\n\\]\n\nAdding the constant term 2:\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(y^4 - y^3 + 0.75 y^2 - 0.5 y + 0.0625) + (2y^3 - 3 y^2 + 1.5 y - 0.25) + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( y^4 \\): 1\n- \\( y^3 \\): -1 + 2 = 1\n- \\( y^2 \\): 0.75 - 3 = -2.25\n- \\( y \\): -0.5 + 1.5 = 1\n- Constants: 0.0625 - 0.25 + 2 = 1.8125\n\nSo the transformed equation is:\n\n\\[\ny^4 + y^3 - 2.25 y^2 + y + 1.8125 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe another substitution? Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me check if the original equation can be factored. \n\nLooking at \\( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 \\), maybe it's a quartic that can be written as a product of quadratics. Let's suppose:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd\n\\]\n\nComparing coefficients with the left-hand side:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): 1 = 1 (matches)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): 2 = a + c\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): 0 = ac + b + d\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): 0 = ad + bc\n5.

From equation 4, \\( bd = 2 \\). Possible integer pairs (b, d) are (1, 2), (2, 1), (-1, -2), (-2, -1). Let's try (1, 2):\n\nThen equation 3: \\( a \\cdot 2 + b \\cdot c = 0 \\). Since b = 1, c = 2 - a. Then:\n\n\\( 2a + 1 \\cdot (2 - a) = 0 \\)\n\\( 2a + 2 - a = 0 \\)\n\\( a + 2 = 0 \\)\n\\( a = -2 \\)\n\nThen c = 2 - (-2) = 4. Check equation 2: \\( ac + b + d = (-2)(4) + 1 + 2 = -8 + 3 = -5 \\neq 0 \\). Not good.\n\nNext, try (2, 1):\n\nEquation 3: \\( a \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot c = 0 \\). So \\( a + 2c = 0 \\). Then \\( a = -2c \\). From equation 2: \\( ac + 2 + 1 = 0 \\).

Not helpful.\n\nNext, try (-1, -2):\n\nEquation 3: \\( a \\cdot (-2) + (-1) \\cdot c = 0 \\). So \\( -2a - c = 0 \\) => \\( c = -2a \\). From equation 2: \\( a \\cdot (-2a) + (-1) + (-2) = 0 \\). So:\n\n\\( -2a^2 -3 = 0 \\)\n\\( -2a^2 = 3 \\)\n\\( a^2 = -3/2 \\). Not possible.\n\nNext, (-2, -1):\n\nEquation 3: \\( a \\cdot (-1) + (-2) \\cdot c = 0 \\). So \\( -a - 2c = 0 \\) => \\( a = -2c \\). From equation 2: \\( a \\cdot (-1) + (-2) + (-1) = 0 \\). So:\n\n\\( -a -3 = 0 \\)\n\\( -a = 3 \\)\n\\( a = -3 \\)\nThen c = -2a = 6. Check equation 2: \\( (-3)(6) + (-2) + (-1) = -18 -3 = -21 \\neq 0 \\). Not good.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Maybe the quartic can't be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients. Let's try another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the substitution \\( y = x + 1 \\). Let's try that. Let \\( y = x + 1 \\), so \\( x = y - 1 \\).

Then, it mentions that the currency doesn't have a cent, which is interesting. Wait, does that mean they are using a different currency system? Or maybe they are just using a different unit for the price? The problem says \"stanejo $1.24\" and \"stanejo $1.82\", so maybe they are using a currency that doesn't have cents, like a currency where the smallest unit is a different coin. But the problem also mentions \"Cene ne vključnoj veku\", which translates to \"Cene don't come together in a week\".

The original problem is in Russian, but the user translated it. The original problem might have been in another language, but the translation is given here. The key is that the currency doesn't have a cent, so they are using a currency where the smallest unit is a different coin. But the problem is asking for the total price in cents. So, maybe the answer is simply the sum of the two prices converted to cents. \n\nLet me check. If a svinčniki costs $1.24, that's 1 dollar and 24 cents. Similarly, a pet svinčnik costs $1.82, which is 1 dollar and 82 cents. So, adding those two together: 1.24 + 1.82. Let me compute that. \n\n1.24 + 1.82. Adding the dollars first: 1 + 1 = 2 dollars. Then adding the cents: 24 + 82 = 106 cents. So, total is 2 dollars and 106 cents. But the problem says \"Cene ne vključnoj veku\", which might mean that the currency doesn't have a cent, so maybe the answer is 2 dollars and 106 cents, but since the problem is in Russian and the user is asking for the answer in cents, maybe they expect the total in cents. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"Cene ne vključnoj veku\", which might be a hint that the currency doesn't have a cent, but the problem is just asking for the total price in cents. So, maybe the answer is simply the sum of the two prices converted to cents. \n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"Cene ne vključnoj veku\", which might be a hint that the currency doesn't have a cent, but the problem is just asking for the total price in cents. So, maybe the answer is 2 dollars and 106 cents, but since the problem is in Russian and the user is asking for the answer in cents, maybe they expect the total in cents. \n\nWait, but the problem is presented in a way that the answer is expected in cents. So, maybe the answer is 2 dollars and 106 cents, but since the problem is in Russian and the user is asking for the answer in cents, maybe they expect the total in cents. \n\nBut let me check the original problem again.

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that converting a fraction to a decimal involves dividing the numerator by the denominator. So, 137 divided by 500. Let me write that down: 137 ÷ 500. \n\nI can do this division step by step. Let's see. 500 goes into 137 how many times? Well, 500 is bigger than 137, so the whole number part of the decimal will be 0. Then, I can add a decimal point and some zeros to the numerator to make it 137.000... \n\nSo, 500 goes into 1370 (after adding a decimal) how many times? Let's see. 500 times 2 is 1000. 1370 minus 1000 is 370. So, 2 is the first digit after the decimal. \n\nNow, I have 370 left. 500 goes into 370 how many times? Well, 500 is still bigger, so 0. So, bring down another 0, making it 3700. \n\n500 goes into 3700 how many times? 500 times 7 is 3500. 3700 minus 3500 is 200. So, the next digit is 7. \n\nNow, we have 200. Bring down another 0, making it 2000. \n\n500 goes into 2000 how many times? 500 times 4 is 2000. So, the next digit is 4. \n\nNow, subtract 2000 from 2000, which leaves 0. So, there's no remainder. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, 137 divided by 500 is 0.274. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 0.274 multiplied by 500 is 0.274 * 500. Let's compute that. 0.2 * 500 = 100, 0.07 * 500 = 35, 0.004 * 500 = 2. So, 100 + 35 + 2 = 137. Exactly. \n\nSo, that checks out. Therefore, the decimal representation of 137/500 is 0.274. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Katera je; nesli v decimalne zlatici v decimalne zlatici 137/500?\". Hmm, maybe there's a typo or something? Because 137/500 is a fraction, and converting it to a decimal is straightforward. But maybe the original problem was in another language, and \"nesli v decimalne zlatici v decimalne zlatici\" translates to \"Is Katera correct in decimalizing 137/500?\" \n\nBut according to the math, it's correct. Let me just confirm once more. \n\n137 divided by 500. Let's do the division again. \n\n500 goes into 1370 (after adding a decimal) 2 times. 2*500=1000. 1370-1000=370. \n\nBring down a zero: 3700. 500 goes into 3700 7 times. 7*500=3500. 3700-3500=200. \n\nBring down a zero: 2000. 500 goes into 2000 4 times. 4*500=2000. 2000-2000=0. \n\nSo, the decimal is 0.274. \n\nTherefore, Katera can solve the problem. \n\n**Final Answer**\nKatera se pravno zlatici 137/500 na desni stranu decimalne v decimalne zlatici.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Katera can solve the problem of converting the fraction \\(\\frac{137}{500}\\) into a decimal, we perform the division \\(137 \\div 500\\):\n\n1. **Set up the division**: \\(137 \\div 500\\).\n2. **Add a decimal point**: \\(137.000\\).\n3. **Divide step by step**:\n   - \\(500\\) goes into \\(1370\\) (after adding a decimal) \\(2\\) times.

I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle ABCD is within a certain distance from the center O, given that the ratio of AB to AD is k. Hmm, so first, let me visualize the problem. The rectangle has sides AB and AD, with AB being k times longer than AD. The center O is at the intersection of the diagonals, which is also the midpoint of both AB and AD. \n\nSince the point is chosen randomly inside the rectangle, the probability should be the area of the region within a certain distance from O divided by the total area of the rectangle. The distance from O to the point is the Euclidean distance. So, the problem reduces to finding the area of the circle centered at O with radius equal to the distance from O to the point, but only considering the part of the circle that lies within the rectangle. Then, the probability would be the area of this intersection divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"točka jegljena izbrana iz notranej pravokotnika ABCD.\" So, the point is chosen uniformly at random inside the rectangle. Therefore, the probability is the area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius r (where r is the distance from O to the point) divided by the area of the rectangle. But since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the average value of the area of the intersection over all possible positions of the point inside the rectangle. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the probability is the integral over all possible positions of the point inside the rectangle of the area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius equal to the distance from O to the point, divided by the area of the rectangle. But since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the average area of the intersection. So, mathematically, it's the integral over the rectangle of the area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius equal to the distance from O to the point, divided by the area of the rectangle. \n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Since the rectangle is symmetric, and the center O is the midpoint, the problem might be symmetric in some way. Let me think. If the rectangle is axis-aligned with O at the center, then the distance from O to any point (x, y) is sqrt(x² + y²). So, the area of the intersection of the circle with the rectangle would depend on the position of the point. But since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the average of the area of the intersection over all points in the rectangle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a double integral over the rectangle, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe we can use polar coordinates. Let me try that. \n\nLet me set up a coordinate system with O at the origin (0,0). The rectangle has vertices at (±a, ±b), where a is half the length of AB and b is half the length of AD. Since AB/AD = k, we have a = k*b. So, the rectangle has dimensions 2a by 2b, with a = k*b. \n\nThe distance from O to a point (x, y) is sqrt(x² + y²). The area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius r is the area of the circle if r ≤ a and r ≤ b, but since the rectangle is axis-aligned, the intersection is a quarter-circle if r ≤ a and r ≤ b, but actually, the intersection is a circle segment. Wait, no. If the circle is entirely within the rectangle, then the intersection is the entire circle. If the circle extends beyond the rectangle, then the intersection is a segment of the circle. \n\nBut since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the average area of the intersection. So, we need to compute the integral over the rectangle of the area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius equal to the distance from O to the point, divided by the area of the rectangle. \n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. Since the rectangle is symmetric, and the center O is the midpoint, the problem is symmetric in all four quadrants. Therefore, we can compute the probability in one quadrant and multiply by four. \n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is axis-aligned, maybe we can use polar coordinates. Let me try that. \n\nLet me set up polar coordinates with the origin at O. The distance from O to a point (x, y) is r, and the angle is θ. The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. The area of the intersection of the circle with the rectangle would depend on the position of the point. \n\nBut since the rectangle is axis-aligned, the intersection area in polar coordinates would be the area of the circle segment that lies within the rectangle. However, this might be complicated because the circle can extend beyond the rectangle in some directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem as follows: For a given point (x, y) inside the rectangle, the distance from O is sqrt(x² + y²). The area of the intersection of the circle centered at O with radius equal to the distance from O to the point is the area of the circle if the radius is less than or equal to the minimum of a and b. But since the rectangle is axis-aligned, the intersection is a circle segment. \n\nWait, no. If the radius is less than or equal to a and b, then the intersection is a circle segment. If the radius is greater than a or b, then the intersection is a quarter-circle. \n\nBut since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the average of the area of the intersection over all points in the rectangle. So, we need to compute the integral over the rectangle of the area of the intersection divided by the area of the rectangle. \n\nBut this seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

{"original_question": "Določite ostanek pri deljenju 54 (mod 6).", "question": "Določite ostanek pri deljenju 54 (mod 6).", "response": " \nOkay, so I need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you divide numbers, the remainder is what's left after you subtract the largest multiple of the divisor that's less than or equal to the dividend. \n\nLet me break it down. The divisor here is 6, and the dividend is 54. So, I need to figure out how many times 6 can fit into 54 without going over. \n\nFirst, let's do the division: 54 divided by 6. Well, 6 times 9 is 54. So, 6*9 = 54. That means 6 goes into 54 exactly 9 times. \n\nBut wait, when you divide, the remainder is the part left over. Since 6*9 is exactly 54, there's nothing left over. So, the remainder should be 0. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's see. If I divide 54 by 6, 6*10 is 60, which is more than 54. So, 6*9 is 54, which is exactly equal. So, 54 divided by 6 is 9 with a remainder of 0. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula: remainder = dividend - (divisor * quotient). So, 54 - (6*9) = 54 - 54 = 0. That also gives me 0. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check with another method. Let's list the multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54. So, 54 is the 9th multiple of 6. Therefore, when you divide 54 by 6, you get 9 with no remainder. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of division as repeated subtraction, how many times can I subtract 6 from 54? Starting with 54, subtract 6 once: 54-6=48, subtract again: 48-6=42, subtract again: 42-6=36, subtract again: 36-6=30, subtract again: 30-6=24, subtract again: 24-6=18, subtract again: 18-6=12, subtract again: 12-6=6, subtract again: 6-6=0. So, I subtracted 6 a total of 9 times. Therefore, the remainder is 0. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (with \\(b > 0\\)), there exist unique integers \\(q\\) (the quotient) and \\(r\\) (the remainder) such that \\(a = bq + r\\) and \\(0 \\leq r < b\\).\n\nHere, \\(a = 54\\) and \\(b = 6\\). We need to find \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) such that:\n\\[ 54 = 6q + r \\]\nwhere \\(0 \\leq r < 6\\).\n\nFirst, we determine the quotient \\(q\\) by dividing 54 by 6:\n\\[ 54 \\div 6 = 9 \\]\nThus, \\(q = 9\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the remainder \\(r\\) by subtracting the product of the quotient and the divisor from the dividend:\n\\[ r = 54 - 6 \\times 9 = 54 - 54 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can also verify this by listing the multiples of 6 and counting how many times 6 fits into 54:\n\\[ 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\]\n\nSince 54 is the 9th multiple of 6, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", "answer": "0"}

I need to compute the sum of three functions evaluated at different points: f(π/3), f(√45), and f(8^(2/3)). The function f(n) is defined piecewise: if n is greater than or equal to 4, then f(n) is the floor of n, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to n. If n is less than 4, then f(n) is the ceiling of n, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's handle f(π/3). π is approximately 3.14159, so π/3 is roughly 1.047. Since 1.047 is less than 4, according to the definition of f(n), we need to take the ceiling of π/3. The ceiling of 1.047 is 2, because 2 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1.047. So f(π/3) = 2.\n\nNext, f(√45). Let's compute √45 first. 45 is between 6² = 36 and 7² = 49, so √45 is between 6 and 7. To get a better approximation, 6² = 36, 6.7² = 44.89, so √45 is approximately 6.7. Since 6.7 is less than 4, we need to take the ceiling of 6.7. The ceiling of 6.7 is 7. So f(√45) = 7.\n\nNow, f(8^(2/3)). Let's compute 8^(2/3). 8 is 2³, so 8^(2/3) is (2³)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2² = 4. Wait, that's interesting. So 8^(2/3) is 4. Since 4 is equal to 4, we need to take the floor of 4. The floor of 4 is 4. So f(8^(2/3)) = 4.\n\nNow, adding them up: f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)) = 2 + 7 + 4. Let's compute that: 2 + 7 is 9, and 9 + 4 is 13. So the total sum is 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For f(π/3): π/3 is approximately 1.047, which is less than 4, so ceiling is 2. Correct. For f(√45): √45 is approximately 6.7, which is less than 4, so ceiling is 7. Correct. For f(8^(2/3)): 8^(2/3) is 4, which is exactly 4, so floor is 4. Correct. Adding them: 2 + 7 + 4 = 13. Seems right.\n\nBut let me just verify once more. Maybe I messed up the ceiling or floor. For f(π/3): π/3 is approximately 1.047, which is less than 4, so the ceiling is indeed 2. For f(√45): √45 is approximately 6.7, which is less than 4, so ceiling is 7. For f(8^(2/3)): 8^(2/3) is 4, which is exactly 4, so floor is 4. All steps check out. So the answer should be 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \\( f(n) \\) at three different points: \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\sqrt{45} \\), and \\( 8^{2/3} \\).

Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie each gave me some money in dollars and cents. I need to find out how much total money they have together, then figure out how much more they need to reach a certain amount, which is the amount in the bank. The problem says that the total amount they have is less than the required amount, so I need to calculate the difference, which is the amount they need to add. Then, the question is asking for the amount in cents they need to add, which is the difference in dollars converted to cents. \n\nFirst, let me list out each person's contribution:\n\n- Linda: $27.47\n- Sherry: $35.23\n- June: $37.37\n- Connie: $26.52\n\nSo, I need to add all these amounts together. Let me start by adding Linda and Sherry first. \n\n27.47 + 35.23. Let's add the dollars and cents separately. \n\n27 + 35 = 62 dollars.\n\n0.47 + 0.23 = 0.70 dollars.\n\nSo, 62.70 dollars. \n\nNow, add June's contribution: 37.37. \n\n62.70 + 37.37. \n\nAdding the dollars: 62 + 37 = 99 dollars.\n\nAdding the cents: 0.70 + 0.37 = 1.07 dollars.\n\nSo total so far: 99.07 dollars.\n\nNow, add Connie's contribution: 26.52.\n\n99.07 + 26.52. \n\nAdding the dollars: 99 + 26 = 125 dollars.\n\nAdding the cents: 0.07 + 0.52 = 0.59 dollars.\n\nTotal: 125.59 dollars.\n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\n27.47 + 35.23: 27 + 35 = 62, 0.47 + 0.23 = 0.70. So 62.70.\n\n62.70 + 37.37: 62 + 37 = 99, 0.70 + 0.37 = 1.07. So 99.07.\n\n99.07 + 26.52: 99 + 26 = 125, 0.07 + 0.52 = 0.59. So 125.59. \n\nYes, that seems right. So total is $125.59. \n\nNow, the problem says that the total amount they have is less than the required amount, which is in the bank.

So, the problem is about a student who took a test with 30 questions. The student got 20 correct, 8 wrong, 8 with 90% correct, and 2 with 100% correct. The question is asking if the average (arithmetic mean) of the student's scores is over 80. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate the average. The average is the total sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. Since there are 30 questions, the average will be the sum of all the scores divided by 30. If that average is over 80, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no. \n\nSo, let's break down the scores. The student got 20 correct, which would be 20 points. Then, 8 questions wrong, which would be 0 points. Then, 8 questions with 90% correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, 90% correct would be 0.9 points per question. So, 8 questions * 0.9 points each.

Let me calculate that. \n\n29.2 ÷ 30. \n\nHmm, 30 goes into 29.2 how many times? \n\n30 * 0.9 = 27.0. \n\n29.2 - 27.0 = 2.2. \n\nSo, 0.9 plus 2.2 divided by 30. \n\n2.2 ÷ 30 = 0.0733... \n\nSo, total average is 0.9 + 0.0733 ≈ 0.9733. \n\nWhich is approximately 97.33%. \n\nSo, the average is over 80. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, 20 correct: 20 points. \n\n8 wrong: 0. \n\n8 at 90%: 8 * 0.9 = 7.2. \n\n2 at 100%: 2. \n\nTotal: 20 + 0 + 7.2 + 2 = 29.2. \n\n29.2 divided by 30. \n\n29.2 ÷ 30. \n\n30 goes into 29.2 0.9 times. \n\n29.2 - 27.0 = 2.2. \n\n2.2 ÷ 30 = 0.0733. \n\nSo, 0.9 + 0.0733 = 0.9733. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the average is approximately 97.33%, which is definitely over 80. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, the average is over 80. \n\nBut let me just verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by calculating the average for each category and then combining them. \n\nFor the 20 correct: 20/30 ≈ 66.67%. \n\nFor the 8 wrong: 0/30 = 0%. \n\nFor the 8 at 90%: 7.2/30 = 24%. \n\nFor the 2 at 100%: 2/30 ≈ 6.67%. \n\nAdding these up: 66.67 + 0 + 24 + 6.67 ≈ 97.34%. \n\nSame result. \n\nSo, yes, the average is over 80. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Yes}\n</think>\n\nThe student took a test with 30 questions.

The problem is about a square grid with some numbers in it. The grid is divided into smaller squares, and there are specific conditions given.

Hmm, this seems like a magic square problem, but with some specific constraints. Let me try to parse the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grid is a square, so it's a 4x4 grid, right?

Koliko čevljev manj kot Martha prehodi Jim?", "response": " \nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Jim and Martha who are building a right-angled triangle-shaped garden. Jim is supposed to plant flowers along the diagonal, but Martha wants him to plant flowers along the two sides as well. The garden is a right-angled triangle with sides of 300 and 400 centimeters, and the hypotenuse is 500 centimeters. The question is asking how many more centimeters Martha needs to plant compared to Jim.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in a right-angled triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if the two legs are 300 and 400, then the hypotenuse should be sqrt(300² + 400²). Let me check that.\n\nCalculating 300 squared: 300*300 = 90,000. 400 squared: 400*400 = 160,000. Adding those together: 90,000 + 160,000 = 250,000. Then the square root of 250,000 is 500. So the hypotenuse is indeed 500 centimeters. That checks out.\n\nNow, Jim is going to plant flowers along the diagonal, which is the hypotenuse. So Jim will plant 500 centimeters. Martha wants him to plant along both sides as well. So she needs to plant 300 centimeters along one side and 400 centimeters along the other. Therefore, Martha needs to plant 300 + 400 = 700 centimeters. \n\nBut the question is asking how many more centimeters Martha needs to plant compared to Jim. So we subtract Jim's amount from Martha's amount: 700 - 500 = 200 centimeters. Therefore, Martha needs to plant 200 more centimeters than Jim.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me verify again. The sides are 300, 400, and 500. Jim is planting along the hypotenuse, which is 500. Martha is planting along both legs, which are 300 and 400. So total for Martha is 300 + 400 = 700. 700 - 500 = 200. That seems right.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that Martha is not just planting along the sides but also along the hypotenuse? The problem says \"hodi along the diagonal\" and \"hodi along the sides\". So diagonal is the hypotenuse, and sides are the two legs. So yes, that's correct. So Martha needs to plant along both sides, which are 300 and 400, totaling 700. Jim is planting along the hypotenuse, which is 500. So 700 - 500 = 200. Therefore, Martha needs 200 more centimeters.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"hodi along the diagonal\" and \"hodi along the sides\". So diagonal is the hypotenuse, and sides are the two legs. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, Martha needs to plant 200 more centimeters. So the answer is 200.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of the perimeter? But no, perimeter is the sum of all sides, but Martha is only planting along two sides, not the hypotenuse. So perimeter isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Pythagorean theorem again. If we consider the area of the triangle. The area can be calculated in two ways: (base * height)/2 = (300 * 400)/2 = 60,000. Also, the area can be calculated using the hypotenuse and the altitude to the hypotenuse. Let me check that.\n\nThe formula for the area is (hypotenuse * altitude)/2. So 500 * altitude / 2 = 60,000. Therefore, altitude = (60,000 * 2)/500 = 240. So the altitude to the hypotenuse is 240 centimeters. That might be useful, but I don't know if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using similar triangles. If we consider the two smaller triangles formed by the diagonal, they are similar to the original triangle. But I don't see how that would help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of the sum of the two sides. Since Jim is planting along the hypotenuse, which is 500, and Martha is planting along the two sides, which are 300 and 400. So the difference is 700 - 500 = 200. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is 300 + 400 + 500 = 1200. But Martha is only planting along two sides, so her total is 700, which is 1200 - 500 = 700. So the difference is 700 - 500 = 200. So same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 200 centimeters. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{200}\n</think>\n\nJim is planting flowers along the diagonal (hypotenuse) of a right-angled triangle with sides 300 cm and 400 cm. The hypotenuse is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \\sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \\sqrt{250000} = 500 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nMartha is planting flowers along both sides of the triangle. The total length she needs to plant is the sum of the two sides:\n\n\\[\n300 \\text{ cm} + 400 \\text{ cm} = 700 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe difference in the lengths they need to plant is:\n\n\\[\n700 \\text{ cm} - 500 \\text{ cm} = 200 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThus, Martha needs to plant \\(\\boxed{200}\\) more centimeters than Jim.", "answer": "200"}

I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\) where \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity. Hmm, cube roots of unity... I remember they are the solutions to the equation \\(x^3 = 1\\). So, they are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity. \n\nFirst, let me recall that the cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \\(x^3 - 1 = 0\\), which factors as \\((x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\\). Therefore, the roots are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are the non-real roots.

Let's compute that denominator first. \n\n\\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + \\omega^3\\). \n\nBut we know that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so substituting that in, we get:\n\n\\(1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). \n\nBut from the equation \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\), we can see that \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, substituting that into the denominator:\n\n\\(2 + (-1) = 1\\). \n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to 1. Therefore, the expression \\(S\\) is equal to the sum of the numerators:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nBut since the denominator is 1, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nWait, but that seems like it's just the sum of two fractions. Maybe I can compute this sum directly. Let's compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). Let's rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(1 + \\omega\\) is \\(1 + \\omega^2\\), since \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are complex conjugates. \n\nSo,\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1 + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\). \n\nBut we already know that the denominator is 1, so this simplifies to \\(1 + \\omega^2\\). \n\nSimilarly, compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\(1 + \\omega^2\\), which is \\(1 + \\omega\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\omega}{1 + \\omega} = \\frac{1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega^2)(1 + \\omega)}\\). \n\nAgain, the denominator is 1, so this simplifies to \\(1 + \\omega\\). \n\nTherefore, the original expression \\(S\\) is equal to \\(1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). \n\nBut from the equation \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\), we know that \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n\\(2 + (-1) = 1\\). \n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 1. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the value of the expression is always 1? But that seems counterintuitive. Let me check with specific values. \n\nLet's take \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3}\\), which is \\(\\omega = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Then, compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nFirst, compute \\(1 + \\omega\\):\n\n\\(1 + \\omega = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). \n\nThe reciprocal of this is \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). \n\nSimilarly, compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nFirst, compute \\(1 + \\omega^2\\):\n\n\\(1 + \\omega^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). \n\nThe reciprocal is \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). \n\nTherefore, adding the two reciprocals:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + i\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 1 + 0i = 1\\). \n\nSo, indeed, the value is 1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"vnesite vse možne vrednosti\", which in Russian might mean \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So, is the answer 1? But let me check if there's another possible value. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the expression is symmetric in \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). Let me verify again. \n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nIf we swap \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\), the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\), which is the same as the original. So, the expression is indeed symmetric. \n\nBut according to the calculation, it simplifies to 1. So, is the answer 1? \n\nBut let me check with another value. Let's take \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\), but wait, \\(\\omega^2\\) is a different root. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's stated that \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity, so \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are distinct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal denominator: \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). \n\nWe know that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\). Therefore, \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega = -1\\). \n\nBut in the denominator, we have 1 + \\(\\omega\\) and 1 + \\(\\omega^2\\). Let's compute their product:\n\n(1 + \\(\\omega\\))(1 + \\(\\omega^2\\)) = 1 + \\(\\omega^2\\) + \\(\\omega\\) + \\(\\omega^3\\). \n\nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), this becomes 1 + \\(\\omega^2\\) + \\(\\omega\\) + 1 = 2 + \\(\\omega + \\omega^2\\). \n\nBut \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), so 2 + (-1) = 1. Therefore, the denominator is 1. \n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to 1. \n\nSo, regardless of which root we take, the value is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"vnesite vse možne vrednosti\", which in Russian might mean \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So, is the answer 1? \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the expression step by step again. \n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nLet me compute each term separately. \n\nFirst term: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\(1 + \\omega\\), which is \\(1 + \\omega^2\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1 + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\). \n\nDenominator: \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). \n\nBut \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), so denominator is 2 + (-1) = 1. \n\nTherefore, first term is \\(1 + \\omega^2\\). \n\nSecond term: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\(1 + \\omega^2\\), which is \\(1 + \\omega\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\omega}{1 + \\omega} = \\frac{1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega^2)(1 + \\omega)}\\). \n\nDenominator: same as before, 1. \n\nTherefore, second term is \\(1 + \\omega\\). \n\nTherefore, the original expression is \\(1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). \n\nBut \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), so 2 + (-1) = 1. \n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to 1. \n\nSo, regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the value is 1. \n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"vnesite vse možne vrednosti\", which in Russian might mean \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\".

The problem is about finding the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle (a circle) such that the given distances between points are maintained. The points are labeled A, B, C, D, and the distances given are 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 5. The figure shows a quadrilateral with points D, B, C, and A connected in a specific way. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the figure. The problem mentions a quadrilateral with points D, B, C, and A. The connections are D-B, B-C, C-A, A-D, D-C, and B-A. The distances given are 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 5. Let me note down the connections and distances:\n\n- D-B: 3\n- B-C: 6\n- C-A: 6\n- A-D: 5\n- D-C: 4\n- B-A: 5\n\nSo, the quadrilateral has sides D-B, B-C, C-A, A-D, D-C, and B-A. The distances between these points are given. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points that can lie on a single circle (a circle) such that all these distances are maintained. \n\nSince the problem mentions a circle, I think it's referring to a cyclic quadrilateral, where all four points lie on a circle. However, the problem states \"the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle,\" so maybe it's possible to have more than four points on a circle, but the distances between them must still satisfy the given conditions. \n\nBut how can we approach this? Maybe we need to check if the given distances can form a cyclic quadrilateral, and then see if we can extend this to more points on a circle. \n\nFirst, let's confirm if the given distances can form a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of the products of opposite sides must equal the product of the diagonals. But since we have distances between all pairs of points, maybe we can use the Law of Cosines or other geometric principles to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of cyclic quadrilaterals and see if the given distances can be arranged in such a way. Let's try to reconstruct the figure based on the given distances.\n\nLooking at the figure, the quadrilateral has points D, B, C, and A connected as follows:\n\n- D-B: 3\n- B-C: 6\n- C-A: 6\n- A-D: 5\n- D-C: 4\n- B-A: 5\n\nSo, the sides are D-B, B-C, C-A, A-D, D-C, and B-A. The diagonals are D-C and B-A. \n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to these points to see if they can lie on a circle. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since D-B is 3, let's place point B at (3,0). Then, point C is 6 units away from B, so it can be at (3 + 6*cosθ, 0 + 6*sinθ). Similarly, point A is 5 units away from D, so it can be at (5*cosφ, 5*sinφ). \n\nBut we also have other distances: C-A is 6, D-C is 4, and B-A is 5. Let's see if we can find coordinates for C and A that satisfy all these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's fix point D at (0,0) and point B at (3,0). Then, point C is 6 units away from B, so its coordinates can be (3 + 6*cosθ, 6*sinθ). Similarly, point A is 5 units away from D, so its coordinates are (5*cosφ, 5*sinφ). \n\nNow, we need to ensure that the distance from C to A is 6, the distance from D to C is 4, and the distance from B to A is 5. \n\nLet's write down the equations for these distances:\n\n1. Distance from C to A: sqrt[(5*cosφ - (3 + 6*cosθ))² + (5*sinφ - 6*sinθ)²] = 6\n2. Distance from D to C: sqrt[(3 + 6*cosθ)² + (6*sinθ)²] = 4\n3. Distance from B to A: sqrt[(5*cosφ - 3)² + (5*sinφ - 0)²] = 5\n\nLet me compute these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with the distance from D to C:\n\nsqrt[(3 + 6*cosθ)² + (6*sinθ)²] = 4\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(3 + 6*cosθ)² + (6*sinθ)² = 16\n\nExpanding the first term:\n\n9 + 36*cosθ + 36*cos²θ + 36*sin²θ = 16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9 + 36*(cosθ + sin²θ + cos²θ) = 16\n\nSince cos²θ + sin²θ = 1:\n\n9 + 36*(cosθ + 1) = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n9 + 36*cosθ + 36 = 16\n\n45 + 36*cosθ = 16\n\n36*cosθ = -29\n\ncosθ = -29/36 ≈ -0.8056\n\nSo θ ≈ arccos(-29/36) ≈ 135 degrees or 225 degrees. Let's take θ = 135 degrees for simplicity. Then, cosθ = -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071, but wait, we had cosθ = -29/36 ≈ -0.8056. So θ is approximately 135 degrees. Let's compute θ more precisely.\n\ncosθ = -29/36 ≈ -0.8056\n\nθ = arccos(-29/36) ≈ 135 degrees. Let's compute θ in radians for easier calculations later.\n\nNow, moving to the distance from B to A:\n\nsqrt[(5*cosφ - 3)² + (5*sinφ - 0)²] = 5\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(5*cosφ - 3)² + (5*sinφ)² = 25\n\nExpanding:\n\n25*cos²φ - 30*cosφ + 9 + 25*sin²φ = 25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n25*(cos²φ + sin²φ) - 30*cosφ + 9 = 25\n\nSince cos²φ + sin²φ = 1:\n\n25 - 30*cosφ + 9 = 25\n\n34 - 30*cosφ = 25\n\n-30*cosφ = -9\n\ncosφ = 9/30 = 3/10 = 0.3\n\nSo φ = arccos(3/10) ≈ 72.54 degrees. Let's compute φ in radians.\n\nNow, moving to the distance from C to A:\n\nsqrt[(5*cosφ - (3 + 6*cosθ))² + (5*sinφ - 6*sinθ)²] = 6\n\nLet's compute the coordinates of C and A.\n\nFirst, coordinates of C: (3 + 6*cosθ, 6*sinθ)\n\nCoordinates of A: (5*cosφ, 5*sinφ)\n\nPlugging in θ ≈ 135 degrees and φ ≈ 72.54 degrees.\n\nFirst, compute θ = 135 degrees:\n\ncosθ = -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071\n\nsinθ = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\nSo, coordinates of C:\n\nx_C = 3 + 6*(-√2/2) = 3 - 3√2 ≈ 3 - 4.2426 ≈ -1.2426\n\ny_C = 6*(√2/2) = 3√2 ≈ 4.2426\n\nCoordinates of A:\n\nx_A = 5*cosφ ≈ 5*0.3 = 1.5\n\ny_A = 5*sinφ ≈ 5*0.9511 ≈ 4.755\n\nNow, compute the distance between C and A:\n\nsqrt[(x_A - x_C)^2 + (y_A - y_C)^2]\n\nCompute x_A - x_C = 1.5 - (-1.2426) ≈ 1.5 + 1.2426 ≈ 2.7426\n\ny_A - y_C = 4.755 - 4.2426 ≈ 0.5124\n\nSo, distance ≈ sqrt[(2.7426)^2 + (0.5124)^2] ≈ sqrt[7.519 + 0.2626] ≈ sqrt[7.7816] ≈ 2.789, which is approximately 2.79, not 6. So this doesn't satisfy the distance of 6. Therefore, our initial assumption that θ = 135 degrees and φ = 72.54 degrees is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that our initial coordinate assignment might not be correct. Maybe we need to adjust the angles. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points lie on a circle, and we need to find the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle with the given distances. Since the problem mentions a circle, maybe the maximum number is 4, as a quadrilateral can be cyclic. But the problem says \"the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle,\" so maybe more than four points can lie on a circle. However, in a cyclic quadrilateral, only four points can lie on a circle. But the problem might be referring to a circle that passes through more than four points, but in reality, a circle can only pass through four points if they are concyclic. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle,\" so maybe it's possible to have more than four points on a circle. But in reality, a circle can only pass through four points if they are concyclic. However, the problem might be referring to a circle that can pass through more than four points, but in that case, it's a circle that is not necessarily passing through all points, but just passing through some of them. But the problem states \"the maximum number of points that can lie on a circle,\" so maybe it's possible to have more than four points on a circle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure is not a quadrilateral but a different polygon, but the problem mentions a circle. Wait, the figure is a quadrilateral with points D, B, C, A connected as D-B-C-A-D.
