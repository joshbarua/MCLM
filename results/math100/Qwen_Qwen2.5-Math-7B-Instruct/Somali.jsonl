This means that \\( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \\). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \\( x \\le y \\) without loss of generality.\n\nNext, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \\( x = 1 \\) or \\( y = 1 \\), then the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(1, y) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\]\n\\[ f(x, 1) = x \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\]\nThe maximum value of \\( \\sqrt{1 - y^2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\) occurs when \\( y = 0 \\) or \\( x = 0 \\), respectively. Thus, the maximum value on the boundary is \\( \\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \\).\n\nNow, we need to check if there is a higher value inside the region \\(-1 < x < 1\\) and \\(-1 < y < 1\\). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \\( f(x, y) \\) and set them to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sqrt{1 - y^2} - \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\]\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \\frac{xy}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\]\nSquaring both sides, we obtain:\n\\[ 1 - y^2 = \\frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 1 - x^2 \\), we get:\n\\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\]\nThis is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. Therefore, the critical points occur on the boundary of this circle.\n\nWe already know that the maximum value on the boundary is 1. To confirm that this is indeed the maximum value, we can check the value of \\( f(x, y) \\) at any point on the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). For example, at the point \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\):\n\\[ f\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of the function \\( f(x, y) \\) over the domain \\(-1 \\le x, y \\le 1\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "1"}

Determine the value of the nickels in terms of senti.\n3. Calculate the number of nickels.\n\nFirst, we know that Hillary has a total of 75 senti. We also know that she has dimes and nickels. Let's denote the number of dimes she has as \\( d \\) and the number of nickels she has as \\( n \\).\n\nThe value of the dimes in senti is \\( 10d \\) (since each dime is worth 10 senti), and the value of the nickels in senti is \\( 5n \\) (since each nickel is worth 5 senti). According to the problem, the total value of the coins is 75 senti, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:\n\\[ 2d + n = 15 \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that the number of nickels \\( n \\) is equal to 15 minus twice the number of dimes \\( d \\). Since \\( d \\) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a dime), and \\( n \\) must also be a whole number, we need to find a value of \\( d \\) that makes \\( n \\) a whole number.\n\nLet's test some values for \\( d \\):\n- If \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 0 = 15 \\).\n- If \\( d = 1 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 1 = 13 \\).\n- If \\( d = 2 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 2 = 11 \\).\n- If \\( d = 3 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n- If \\( d = 4 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 4 = 7 \\).\n- If \\( d = 5 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 5 = 5 \\).\n- If \\( d = 6 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 6 = 3 \\).\n- If \\( d = 7 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 7 = 1 \\).\n- If \\( d = 8 \\), then \\( n = 15 - 2 \\cdot 8 = -1 \\) (which is not possible since \\( n \\) must be a non-negative whole number).\n\nFrom the above calculations, we see that \\( n \\) can be any odd number from 1 to 15. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of dimes, so we can conclude that the number of nickels is one of the possible values. But since the problem asks for the number of nickels, and without additional information to specify the exact number of dimes, we can assume the problem is asking for a possible value. The most logical and straightforward interpretation is that the problem is asking for a possible value of \\( n \\) that fits the equation.\n\nTherefore, the number of nickels Hillary has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]", "answer": "7"}

Let's start by examining the prime factorization of the numerator, 4321.\n\nFirst, we check if 4321 is divisible by small prime numbers. It is not divisible by 2 (since it is odd), 3 (since the sum of its digits, \\(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\\), is not divisible by 3), or 5 (since it does not end in 0 or 5). Next, we check if it is divisible by 7:\n\n\\[4321 \\div 7 = 617.2857\\]\n\nSince 617.2857 is not an integer, 4321 is not divisible by 7. We continue this process with other prime numbers.
