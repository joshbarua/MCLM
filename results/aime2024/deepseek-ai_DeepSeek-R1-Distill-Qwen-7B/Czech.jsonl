So, Aya has a procházka that's 9 kilometers long, and after that, she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. Depending on her speed, the total time she takes changes. \n\nFirst, when she goes at a speed of s km/h, the whole trip, including the break, takes 4 hours. When she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours or 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. \n\nSo, the key here is that the distance of the procházka is 9 km, and the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop is equal to the total time given. \n\nLet me write down the equations based on this information.\n\nWhen her speed is s km/h:\nTime spent walking = distance / speed = 9 / s hours\nTotal time = walking time + break time\nSo, 9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSimilarly, when her speed is s + 2 km/h:\nWalking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours\nTotal time = 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4 hours\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n1) 9/s + t/60 = 4\n2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nHmm, okay, so we have two equations with two variables, s and t. We can solve these equations to find s and t, and then use s + 1/2 to find the total time when her speed is s + 0.5 km/h.\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t/60.\n\n(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s + 2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4\nSimplify:\n9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nLet me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):\n= 9(s + 2) - 9s / [s(s + 2)]\n= [9s + 18 - 9s] / [s(s + 2)]\n= 18 / [s(s + 2)]\n\nSo, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nLet me write that as:\n18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)\nDivide both sides by 1.6:\n18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)\n18 divided by 1.6 is the same as 18 * (10/16) = 18 * (5/8) = 90/8 = 11.25\n\nSo, s(s + 2) = 11.25\n\nLet me write this as a quadratic equation:\ns^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nTo solve for s, use the quadratic formula:\ns = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2\nBecause sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) = sqrt(4 + 45) = sqrt(49) = 7\n\nSo, s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 or s = (-2 -7)/2 = -4.5\n\nSince speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h\n\nNow that we have s, we can find t from one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4\nPlug in s = 2.5:\n9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4\n9 / 2.5 is 3.6, so:\n3.6 + t/60 = 4\nSubtract 3.6:\nt/60 = 0.4\nMultiply both sides by 60:\nt = 24 minutes\n\nSo, t is 24 minutes.\n\nNow, the question asks for the total time when Aya's speed is s + 0.5 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.\n\nSo, walking time at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.\n\nAdding the break time t = 24 minutes, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nConvert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time is 204 minutes.\n</think>\n\nAya's procházka at speed \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\) km/h takes a total of \\(\\boxed{204}\\) minutes, including the break \\( t \\).", "answer": "204"}

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nWe have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ABC is a cyclic triangle, right? So, all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle ω. Now, the problem says that the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Hmm, tangents from a common external point are equal in length, so DB should be equal to DC. That might come in handy later.\n\nThen, it mentions that the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, which is outside the circle, and this line meets the circle again at P. We need to find the length of AP. \n\nThe given side lengths are AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. So, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me note that down. \n\nThe problem asks for AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then to find m + n. So, I need to figure out AP in terms of these given lengths.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the problem to visualize it better. I have triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. So, D is the ex-pole with respect to ω, and AD is a secant line passing through P.\n\nI remember that when dealing with tangents and circles, power of a point is a useful concept. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² = DC², since DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. Also, since D lies outside the circle, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. That seems important.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and hence find AP as DA + DP or DA - DP, depending on the position. Wait, actually, since D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant, the power of D is DA * DP = DB². So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DA and DP.\n\nBut I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can find DB using some other properties. Let me think.\n\nSince ABC is a triangle inscribed in ω, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole of BC. So, D lies on the external angle bisector of angle A? Wait, no, actually, the intersection of two tangents at B and C would lie on the external angle bisector of angle A. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, the internal angle bisector of angle A would pass through the incenter, but the ex-pole is different. Maybe I need to recall that D is the ex-pole, so it's related to the A-excircle. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates or trigonometry to find the necessary lengths. Let me try to assign coordinates to the triangle ABC to make it easier.\n\nLet me place point A at (0,0), point B at (5,0), since AB=5. Then, point C is somewhere such that AC=10 and BC=9. Let me find the coordinates of C.\n\nSo, coordinates of A: (0,0)\nCoordinates of B: (5,0)\nCoordinates of C: Let's say (x,y). Then, distance from A to C is 10, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 10, so x² + y² = 100.\n\nDistance from B to C is 9, so sqrt((x - 5)² + y²) = 9, so (x - 5)² + y² = 81.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 5)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 81 - 100 => x² -10x +25 + y² -x² - y² = -19 => -10x +25 = -19 => -10x = -44 => x = 4.4.\n\nSo, x = 22/5. Then, from x² + y² = 100, we have (22/5)² + y² = 100 => 484/25 + y² = 100 => y² = 100 - 484/25 = (2500 - 484)/25 = 2016/25 => y = sqrt(2016)/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(2016): 2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 14, so sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(14) = 12 sqrt(14). So, y = 12 sqrt(14)/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of C are (22/5, 12 sqrt(14)/5).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of the circle ω passing through A, B, C. Since A, B, C are points on the circle, I can find the equation of the circle.\n\nLet me denote the circle equation as (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r².\n\nPlugging in A(0,0): h² + k² = r².\n\nPlugging in B(5,0): (5 - h)² + k² = r².\n\nSubtracting A's equation from B's: (5 - h)² + k² - (h² + k²) = 0 => 25 -10h + h² - h² = 0 => 25 -10h = 0 => h = 25/10 = 5/2.\n\nSo, h = 5/2. Now, plug in point C(22/5, 12 sqrt(14)/5):\n\n(22/5 - 5/2)² + (12 sqrt(14)/5 - k)² = r².\n\nFirst, compute 22/5 - 5/2: convert to common denominator 10: 44/10 - 25/10 = 19/10.\n\nSo, (19/10)² + (12 sqrt(14)/5 - k)² = r².\n\nCompute (19/10)² = 361/100.\n\nSo, 361/100 + (12 sqrt(14)/5 - k)² = r².\n\nBut from point A, h² + k² = r²: (5/2)² + k² = r² => 25/4 + k² = r².\n\nSo, set equal:\n\n361/100 + (12 sqrt(14)/5 - k)² = 25/4 + k².\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n361/100 + (12 sqrt(14)/5 - k)² = 361/100 + (12 sqrt(14)/5)² - 2*(12 sqrt(14)/5)*k + k².\n\nCompute (12 sqrt(14)/5)²: (144 * 14)/25 = 2016/25.\n\nSo, left side becomes: 361/100 + 2016/25 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k + k².\n\nConvert 2016/25 to 100 denominator: 2016/25 = 8064/100.\n\nSo, 361/100 + 8064/100 = 8425/100 = 337/4.\n\nSo, left side is 337/4 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k + k².\n\nSet equal to right side: 25/4 + k².\n\nSubtract right side from both sides:\n\n337/4 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k + k² - 25/4 - k² = 0 => (337 - 25)/4 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k = 0 => 312/4 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k = 0 => 78 - (24 sqrt(14)/5)k = 0.\n\nSo, 78 = (24 sqrt(14)/5)k => k = (78 * 5)/(24 sqrt(14)) = (390)/(24 sqrt(14)) = Simplify numerator and denominator: 390 ÷ 6 = 65, 24 ÷ 6 = 4. So, 65/(4 sqrt(14)).\n\nRationalize denominator: 65 sqrt(14)/(4 * 14) = 65 sqrt(14)/56.\n\nSo, k = 65 sqrt(14)/56.\n\nTherefore, the center of the circle ω is at (5/2, 65 sqrt(14)/56), and radius squared is h² + k² = (25/4) + (65² *14)/(56²).\n\nBut maybe I don't need the radius right now. Let me see.\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSo, if I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then their intersection is point D.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of OB. Coordinates of O: (5/2, 65 sqrt(14)/56). Coordinates of B: (5,0).\n\nSlope of OB: (0 - 65 sqrt(14)/56)/(5 - 5/2) = (-65 sqrt(14)/56)/(5/2) = (-65 sqrt(14)/56)*(2/5) = (-130 sqrt(14))/280 = (-13 sqrt(14))/28.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of this, which is 28/(13 sqrt(14)).\n\nSimilarly, slope of OC: Coordinates of O: (5/2, 65 sqrt(14)/56). Coordinates of C: (22/5, 12 sqrt(14)/5).\n\nSlope of OC: (12 sqrt(14)/5 - 65 sqrt(14)/56)/(22/5 - 5/2).\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\n12 sqrt(14)/5 - 65 sqrt(14)/56 = sqrt(14)*(12/5 - 65/56). Let's compute 12/5 - 65/56.\n\nConvert to common denominator 280: 12/5 = 672/280, 65/56 = 325/280. So, 672 - 325 = 347. So, 347/280.\n\nThus, numerator is sqrt(14)*(347/280).\n\nDenominator: 22/5 - 5/2 = (44/10 - 25/10) = 19/10.\n\nSo, slope of OC is (sqrt(14)*(347/280))/(19/10) = sqrt(14)*(347/280)*(10/19) = sqrt(14)*(347*10)/(280*19) = sqrt(14)*(3470)/(5320) = sqrt(14)*(347)/(532).\n\nSimplify 347 and 532: 347 is a prime number? Let me check. 347 divided by 2, no. 3: 3*115=345, so 347-345=2, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 7, no. 7: 7*49=343, 347-343=4, not divisible by 7. 11: 11*31=341, 347-341=6, not divisible by 11. 13: 13*26=338, 347-338=9, not divisible by 13. 17: 17*20=340, 347-340=7, not divisible by 17. 19: 19*18=342, 347-342=5, not divisible by 19. So, 347 is prime. 532 divided by 2 is 266, divided by 2 is 133, which is 7*19. So, 532 = 4*7*19. 347 and 532 share no common factors, so slope is (347 sqrt(14))/532.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of this, which is -532/(347 sqrt(14)).\n\nSo, now I have the slopes of the two tangents at B and C. Let me write their equations.\n\nTangent at B: passes through B(5,0), slope is 28/(13 sqrt(14)).\n\nEquation: y - 0 = (28/(13 sqrt(14)))(x - 5).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C: passes through C(22/5, 12 sqrt(14)/5), slope is -532/(347 sqrt(14)).\n\nEquation: y - 12 sqrt(14)/5 = (-532/(347 sqrt(14)))(x - 22/5).\n\nNow, to find point", "answer": "113"}

Jaká je hodnota $m+n$?", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem about an octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention expressing this probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me visualize an octagon. It has 8 vertices, each can be red or blue. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out how many of these colorings allow for a rotation that maps all blue vertices to red vertices. Essentially, we need a rotation that shifts the colors such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red, and vice versa. But wait, actually, the problem says \"všechny modré vrcholy\" (all blue vertices) \"skončily na pozicích, kde původně byly červené vrcholy\" (ended up at positions where originally there were red vertices). So, it's not necessarily that all reds go to blues, but that all blues are moved to red positions. So, the rotation should map blue vertices to red vertices, but red vertices can be mapped to blue or remain blue? Wait, no, because the rotation is just a rotation, it doesn't change the color, it just moves the positions. So, if we rotate the octagon, the colors stay the same, but their positions change. So, for the rotated octagon, all the blue vertices must be in positions that were originally red. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. If we have a coloring, and we can rotate it such that all blue vertices end up where the red ones were. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, it has rotational symmetry. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices.\n\nBut actually, the red and blue sets are complements of each other. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set is also a rotation of the blue set. So, essentially, the blue set must be a rotational shift of the red set. Therefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue vertices are a rotation of the red ones.\n\nBut how do we count that? Let's think about it. For each possible rotation, we can have a coloring where blue vertices are exactly the rotated red vertices. But we have to be careful not to overcount because some colorings might be fixed by multiple rotations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of group theory. The octagon's rotational symmetry group is cyclic of order 8. So, the group has elements corresponding to rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. Each rotation can be represented by a shift of 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.\n\nNow, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the set of blue vertices must be a union of some orbits under the group action. But wait, actually, each coloring is fixed by some rotation. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a necklace counting problem. We have a necklace with 8 beads, each either red or blue. We want to count the number of necklaces where all blue beads can be rotated to the positions of the red beads. But since the necklace is considered up to rotation, maybe we need to use Burnside's lemma or something similar.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the colorings are fixed, and we are considering rotations of a fixed coloring. So, it's not about counting distinct necklaces, but about counting colorings that are fixed under some rotation in a specific way.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's fix a rotation by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7. For each such rotation, we can count the number of colorings that are fixed by that rotation, meaning that rotating the octagon by k positions doesn't change the coloring. But actually, in our problem, we don't need the coloring to be fixed by a rotation, but rather that there exists some rotation that maps blue vertices to red vertices.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think about the number of colorings where the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, the only way this can happen is if the blue vertices are equally spaced, forming a regular polygon. But wait, not necessarily equally spaced, but a rotation of the red vertices.\n\nWait, no. If the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices, then the set of blue vertices is just the red set shifted by some number of positions. So, for example, if the red vertices are at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, then a rotation by 1 position would make the blue vertices at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, which is a rotation of the red set.\n\nBut in this case, the red and blue sets are complementary. So, if the red set is a rotation of the blue set, then the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the red set is a rotation of the blue set.\n\nBut how do we count that? Let's think about it.\n\nFirst, note that the number of colorings where the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the red and blue sets are complements, this is equivalent to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the complement of itself.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose we fix a rotation by k positions. For each k, how many colorings are there such that rotating the octagon by k positions maps blue vertices to red vertices. That is, for each vertex v, if v is blue, then the vertex v + k (mod 8) is red, and vice versa.\n\nBut since the octagon is being rotated, the colorings must satisfy that for each blue vertex v, the vertex v + k is red, and for each red vertex v, the vertex v + k is blue. So, this is equivalent to saying that the blue set is equal to the red set shifted by k positions.\n\nBut since the red and blue sets are complements, this implies that the blue set is equal to the complement of itself shifted by k positions. So, blue = (blue shifted by k). Therefore, blue must be a union of cycles under the rotation by k.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think in terms of fixed points.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a given rotation by k positions, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation is 2^gcd(k,8). Because the rotation divides the octagon into gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8/gcd(k,8). For each cycle, all the vertices must have the same color, so the number of fixed colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.\n\nBut in our problem, we don't need the colorings to be fixed by a rotation, but rather that there exists a rotation that maps blue to red. So, it's a different condition.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, for each rotation, we can have a blue set that is the red set shifted by that rotation.\n\nBut since the red and blue sets are complements, this would mean that the blue set is a rotation of the complement of itself. So, blue = (blue shifted by k). Therefore, blue must be a union of orbits under the rotation by k.\n\nBut since the rotation by k has cycles, the blue set must be a union of entire cycles. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets of the cycles of the rotation by k.\n\nWait, that might be a way to think about it. For each rotation k, the number of colorings where blue is a union of cycles of the rotation by k is 2^{number of cycles}.\n\nBut in our case, the rotation is not fixed; we can choose any rotation k. So, we need to count all colorings where for some k, blue is a union of cycles of the rotation by k.\n\nBut this seems complicated because different rotations can lead to overlapping colorings. So, we might have to use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the red and blue sets are complements, this is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a rotation of the complement of itself.\n\nSo, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where blue is equal to (blue shifted by k) is equal to the number of colorings where blue is a union of cycles of the rotation by k.\n\nBut since blue is a subset of the octagon, and the rotation by k has cycles, the number of such colorings is 2^{number of cycles}.\n\nBut since we can choose any rotation k, we need to consider all possible k.\n\nWait, but this might lead to overcounting because a coloring might satisfy the condition for multiple rotations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of group actions. The group here is the cyclic group C8, which has 8 elements corresponding to rotations by 0°, 45°, ..., 315°. The set we are acting on is the set of all colorings, which has 2^8 = 256 elements.\n\nWe are interested in the colorings that are \"rotatable\" such that all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices. So, for each coloring, we want to know if there exists a group element (rotation) that maps the blue set to the red set.\n\nBut in group action terms, this is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a union of orbits under some group element. But since the group is cyclic, the orbits under a rotation are the cycles of that rotation.\n\nWait, but each rotation's orbits are the cycles of that rotation. So, for a rotation by k positions, the orbits are the cycles of length equal to the order of k in the group.\n\nSo, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where blue is a union of orbits of the rotation by k is 2^{number of cycles of rotation k}.\n\nBut since we can choose any rotation, the total number of such colorings is the union over all rotations k of the colorings fixed by rotation k.\n\nBut this is tricky because some colorings might be fixed by multiple rotations, leading to overcounting. So, to compute the exact number, we need to use inclusion-exclusion over all rotations.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion over 8 rotations might be complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Burnside's lemma, which relates the number of orbits to the average number of fixed points. But in this case, we are not counting orbits, but rather the number of colorings fixed by some rotation.\n\nWait, actually, Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points. But here, we are interested in the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation, which is different.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that a coloring is \"good\" if there exists a rotation that maps blue to red. So, the number of good colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.\n\nBut since the red and blue sets are complements, this is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a rotation of the complement of itself.\n\nSo, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where blue is equal to (blue shifted by k) is equal to the number of colorings where blue is a union of cycles of the rotation by k.\n\nBut again, this seems similar to what I thought before.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of colorings where the blue set is a union of some cycles of a rotation. Since each rotation decomposes the octagon into cycles, and the number of such colorings is 2^{number of cycles}.\n\nBut since we can choose any rotation, the total number of colorings is the union over all rotations of these colorings.\n\nBut to compute the exact number, we need to consider the inclusion-exclusion principle over all rotations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the number of colorings where blue is a rotation of red is equal to the number of colorings where blue is a union of some set of cycles from some rotation.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the possible rotations and their cycle structures.\n\nIn the cyclic group C8, the possible rotations correspond to the divisors of 8. So, the rotations can have orders 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\nFor each rotation, the number of cycles is equal to the order of the rotation. For example:\n\n- Rotation by 0 positions (identity): has 8 cycles, each of length 1.\n\n- Rotation by 4 positions: has 2 cycles, each of length 4.\n\n- Rotation by 2 positions: has 4 cycles, each of length 2.\n\n- Rotation by 1 position: has 8 cycles, each of length 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of cycles is equal to the number of orbits, which is equal to the number of divisors. Wait, no, for a rotation by k positions, the number of cycles is equal to gcd(k,8). Each cycle has length 8/gcd(k,8).\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Rotation by 0: gcd(0,8)=8, so 8 cycles of length 1.\n\n- Rotation by 1: gcd(1,8)=1, so 1 cycle of length 8.\n\n- Rotation by 2: gcd(2,8)=2, so 2 cycles of length 4.\n\n- Rotation by 3: gcd(3,8)=1, so 1 cycle of length 8.\n\n- Rotation by 4: gcd(4,8)=4, so 4 cycles of length 2.\n\n- Rotation by 5: gcd(5,8)=1, so 1 cycle of length 8.\n\n- Rotation by 6: gcd(6,8)=2, so 2 cycles of length 4.\n\n- Rotation by 7: gcd(7,8)=1, so 1 cycle of length 8.\n\nSo, for each rotation, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). Therefore, the number of colorings fixed by rotation k is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.\n\nBut in our problem, we are not fixing a rotation, but rather, we want colorings that are fixed by some rotation, i.e., colorings", "answer": "371"}

The functions are defined as \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). The functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are given by \\( f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\) and \\( g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what these functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) look like. Both are absolute value functions, so they will have V-shapes. Let me break them down.\n\nStarting with \\( f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\). The inner part is \\( |x| \\), which is a V-shape with its vertex at the origin. Then, subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) shifts this V-shape down by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), but since it's inside another absolute value, it will reflect any part that goes below the x-axis back up. So, \\( f(x) \\) will have a V-shape that is shifted down but then reflected, creating a sort of \"W\" shape but only with two V's. The vertex of the original \\( |x| \\) is at (0,0), so after subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), the vertex moves to (0, -1/2), but then taking the absolute value reflects the lower part back up, so the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is 0, achieved at \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) will have its minimum at \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\) and will increase linearly as \\( |x| \\) moves away from \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\) will have a similar structure but with a different shift. The inner \\( |x| \\) is shifted down by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), then reflected. So, the minimum of \\( g(x) \\) is 0 at \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{4} \\), and it increases linearly as \\( |x| \\) moves away from \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nNow, moving on to the composite functions. The first equation is \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\). Let me parse this step by step. Starting from the innermost function:\n\n1. \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\): This is a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.\n2. Then, \\( f \\) is applied to this: \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\). So, this will take the sine wave, take its absolute value, which makes it non-negative, then subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and then take the absolute value again. This will create a function that oscillates between 0 and some maximum value. Let me figure out the range.\n\nSince \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\) ranges from 0 to 1, subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) gives a range from \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Then taking the absolute value of that will give a range from 0 to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). So, \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) ranges from 0 to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThen, \\( g \\) is applied to this result: \\( g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) = \\left| f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\). Since \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) is between 0 and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) will give a range from \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). Taking the absolute value again, \\( g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) will range from 0 to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nFinally, multiplying by 4, \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) will range from 0 to 1. So, the first equation is a function \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), oscillating between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, the second equation is \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Similarly, let's break it down:\n\n1. \\( \\cos(3\\pi y) \\): This is a cosine wave with period \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), oscillating between -1 and 1.\n2. Then, \\( f \\) is applied: \\( f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) = \\left| |\\cos(3\\pi y)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\). Similar to before, \\( |\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\) ranges from 0 to 1, subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), take absolute value, so the result ranges from 0 to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n3. Then, \\( g \\) is applied: \\( g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) = \\left| f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\). Again, since \\( f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) \\) is between 0 and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) gives between \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and taking absolute value gives between 0 and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n4. Multiplying by 4, \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, both equations \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\) are functions that map \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) and \\( y \\) to \\( x \\) respectively, both ranging between 0 and 1. \n\nBut wait, actually, the first equation is \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\), and the second is \\( x \\) as a function of \\( y \\). So, to find their intersection points, we need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that both equations are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nSince both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are between 0 and 1, we can consider the domain \\( x, y \\in [0,1] \\).\n\nTo find the number of solutions, I can think about the symmetry and periodicity of the functions involved.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). Both are piecewise linear functions with V-shapes. Let me write out their definitions more explicitly.\n\nFor \\( f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\):\n\n- When \\( |x| \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( f(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- When \\( |x| < \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} - |x| \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\):\n\n- When \\( |x| \\geq \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( g(x) = |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n- When \\( |x| < \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( g(x) = \\frac{1}{4} - |x| \\)\n\nSo, both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are piecewise linear with different breakpoints at \\( \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\pm \\frac{1}{4} \\) respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the composite functions.\n\nStarting with \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\):\n\nSince \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\) has a period of 1, and it's symmetric around \\( x = 0.5 \\), the function \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) will also be periodic with period 1. Similarly, \\( f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) \\) will have a period related to \\( y \\), but since we're dealing with \\( y \\) in [0,1], let's see.\n\nWait, actually, \\( \\cos(3\\pi y) \\) has a period of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), but since \\( y \\) is in [0,1], it will complete 1.5 periods. Hmm, but since we're dealing with \\( y \\) in [0,1], perhaps it's better to consider the behavior over this interval.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting bogged down in periodicity, I can consider the range of the functions.\n\nGiven that both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) map their inputs into [0, 1/2] and [0, 1/4] respectively, the composite functions \\( 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\) will map into [0,1].\n\nSo, both \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) are in [0,1].\n\nNow, to find the number of intersection points, we can consider the system:\n\n\\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\n\\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nSince both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are in [0,1], we can consider the graph of \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\) and the graph of \\( x \\) as a function of \\( y \\). The intersection points are where these two graphs cross each other.\n\nBut since \\( x \\) is expressed in terms of \\( y \\), and \\( y \\) is expressed in terms of \\( x \\), this is a system of equations that can be thought of as \\( y = h(x) \\) and \\( x = h(y) \\), where \\( h \\) is some function. The solutions to this system are the points where \\( y = h(x) \\) and \\( x = h(y) \\), which geometrically are the intersections of the two curves.\n\nIn such cases, the number of solutions can be found by considering the symmetry and the number of times the curves intersect.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to substitute one equation into the other.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\). Let's denote \\( A = f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\), so \\( y = 4g(A) \\).\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation, \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Let's denote \\( B = f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) \\), so \\( x = 4g(B) \\).\n\nBut since \\( A = f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) and \\( B = f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) \\), and \\( y = 4g(A) \\), \\( x = 4g(B) \\), this seems a bit circular. Maybe I can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the system as \\( y = h(x) \\) and \\( x = h(y) \\), so substituting \\( y = h(x) \\) into the second equation gives \\( x = h(h(x)) \\). So, the solutions are the fixed points of the function \\( h \\) composed with itself.\n\nBut before that, let me try to understand the function \\( h(x) = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\). Since \\( h(x) \\) is periodic with period 1, as \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\) is periodic with period 1, \\( h(x) \\) will have the same periodicity. Similarly, \\( h(y) \\) is also periodic with period 1.\n\nBut since both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are in [0,1], we can consider the behavior over this interval.\n\nLet me try to sketch or visualize \\( h(x) = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( \\sin(2\\pi x) \\) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0 as \\( x \\) goes from 0 to 1. So, it's a sine wave with peaks at \\( x = 0.25 \\) and \\( x = 0.75 \\), both equal to 1 and -1 respectively.\n\nThen, \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) is \\( \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\). So, wherever \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\) is above \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), it's just \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\), and below \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), it's \\( \\frac{1}{2} - |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\).\n\nSo, the function \\( f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) \\) will have a V-shape at each peak of \\( |\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\). Let me compute some key points.\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\): \\( \\sin(0) = 0 \\), so \\( f(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nAt \\( x = 0.25 \\): \\( \\sin(2\\pi * 0.25) = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1 \\), so \\( f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2 \\).\n\nAt \\( x = 0.5 \\): \\( \\sin(2\\pi * 0.5) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0", "answer": "385"}

Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a number to be divisible by p², it must be divisible by p, and then also satisfy some additional condition. So, maybe I should start by looking at primes p where there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Because if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p.\n\nI think primes for which -1 is a quartic residue might be relevant here. I recall that for primes p, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But this is for quadratic residues. What about quartic residues? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe similar conditions apply.\n\nLet me check small primes to see if they satisfy this condition. Let's start with p=2. Well, n⁴ +1 mod 2: since any even number is 0 mod 2, and any odd number is 1 mod 2. So, n⁴ is 0 or 1 mod 2. If n is even, n⁴ ≡ 0, so n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 2. If n is odd, n⁴ ≡1, so n⁴ +1 ≡2 ≡0 mod 2. So, p=2 works because for any odd n, n⁴ +1 is divisible by 2. But does it work for p²=4? Let's see: take n=1, 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. n=5: 625 +1=626, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, seems like n⁴ +1 is always 2 mod 4 when n is odd. So, p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out.\n\nNext, p=3. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 3. Since -1 mod 3 is 2. So, n⁴ ≡2 mod 3. Let's compute n⁴ mod 3 for n=0,1,2.\n\nn=0: 0⁴=0 mod3\nn=1:1⁴=1 mod3\nn=2:16≡1 mod3\nSo, n⁴ mod3 is either 0 or 1. So, 2 is never achieved. Therefore, p=3 doesn't work.\n\nNext, p=5. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5. -1 mod5 is 4. So, n⁴ ≡4 mod5. Let's compute n⁴ mod5 for n=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nn=0:0\nn=1:1\nn=2:16≡1\nn=3:81≡1\nn=4:256≡1\nSo, n⁴ mod5 is either 0 or 1. So, 4 is never achieved. Therefore, p=5 doesn't work.\n\nNext, p=7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod7. -1 mod7 is 6. So, n⁴ ≡6 mod7. Let's compute n⁴ mod7 for n=0 to 6.\n\nn=0:0\nn=1:1\nn=2:16≡2\nn=3:81≡4\nn=4:256≡4\nn=5:625≡2\nn=6:1296≡1\nSo, n⁴ mod7 is 0,1,2,4. So, 6 is not achieved. Therefore, p=7 doesn't work.\n\nNext, p=11. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod11. -1 mod11 is 10. So, n⁴ ≡10 mod11. Let's compute n⁴ mod11 for n=0 to 10.\n\nn=0:0\nn=1:1\nn=2:16≡5\nn=3:81≡4\nn=4:256≡3\nn=5:625≡625-55*11=625-605=20≡9\nn=6:1296≡1296-117*11=1296-1287=9\nn=7:2401≡2401-218*11=2401-2398=3\nn=8:4096≡4096-372*11=4096-4092=4\nn=9:6561≡6561-596*11=6561-6556=5\nn=10:10000≡10000-909*11=10000-9999=1\nSo, n⁴ mod11 is 0,1,3,4,5,9. So, 10 is not achieved. Therefore, p=11 doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to go higher. Let's try p=13. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod13, which is 12 mod13. Let's compute n⁴ mod13 for n=0 to 12.\n\nn=0:0\nn=1:1\nn=2:16≡3\nn=3:81≡3\nn=4:256≡256-19*13=256-247=9\nn=5:625≡625-48*13=625-624=1\nn=6:1296≡1296-99*13=1296-1287=9\nn=7:2401≡2401-184*13=2401-2392=9\nn=8:4096≡4096-315*13=4096-4095=1\nn=9:6561≡6561-504*13=6561-6552=9\nn=10:10000≡10000-769*13=10000-9997=3\nn=11:14641≡14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3\nn=12:20736≡20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1\nSo, n⁴ mod13 is 0,1,3,9. So, 12 is not achieved. Therefore, p=13 doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe p=17? Let's check. n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17, which is 16 mod17. Let's compute n⁴ mod17 for n=0 to 16.\n\nn=0:0\nn=1:1\nn=2:16\nn=3:81≡13\nn=4:256≡1\nn=5:625≡625-36*17=625-612=13\nn=6:1296≡1296-76*17=1296-1292=4\nn=7:2401≡2401-141*17=2401-2397=4\nn=8:4096≡4096-241*17=4096-4097=-1≡16\nn=9:6561≡6561-385*17=6561-6545=16\nn=10:10000≡10000-588*17=10000-9996=4\nn=11:14641≡14641-861*17=14641-14637=4\nn=12:20736≡20736-1219*17=20736-20723=13\nn=13:28561≡28561-1680*17=28561-28560=1\nn=14:38416≡38416-2260*17=38416-38420=-4≡13\nn=15:50625≡50625-2978*17=50625-50626=-1≡16\nn=16:65536≡65536-3855*17=65536-65535=1\nSo, n⁴ mod17 is 0,1,4,13,16. So, 16 is achieved when n=2,8,9,15. So, p=17 works because there exists n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. So, p=17 is a candidate.\n\nNow, we need to check if p²=289 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, we need to find the smallest n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.\n\nWait, but before that, is p=17 the smallest prime for which n⁴ +1 is divisible by p²? Because I checked primes up to 17, and only p=17 worked. So, p=17 is the minimal such prime.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.\n\nSo, we need to solve m⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.\n\nI know that m must satisfy m⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 first, which we already know happens for m=2,8,9,15 mod17.\n\nSo, to lift this solution to modulo 289, we can use Hensel's lemma or some method for lifting solutions from mod p to mod p².\n\nLet me recall Hensel's lemma. If f(m) = m⁴ +1, and f'(m) = 4m³. If f(m) ≡0 mod p and f'(m) not≡0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p².\n\nSo, let's take m ≡2 mod17. Let m =2 +17k. Then, we can compute f(m) mod289.\n\nCompute f(2 +17k) = (2 +17k)^4 +1.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2³*(17k) + 6*2²*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2^4=16\n\n4*2³*17k=4*8*17k=544k\n\n6*2²*(17k)^2=6*4*289k²=6*4*289k²=6936k²\n\n4*2*(17k)^3=8*4913k³=39304k³\n\n(17k)^4=83521k⁴\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n16 + 544k + 6936k² + 39304k³ +83521k⁴\n\nNow, mod289, since 17²=289, so 17k mod289 is 17k, (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289, similarly higher powers are 0.\n\nTherefore, mod289, the expansion becomes:\n\n16 + 544k + 0 + 0 +0.\n\nBut 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255, 255-289=-34≡255 mod289? Wait, 544 divided by 289 is 1 with remainder 255. So, 544k ≡255k mod289.\n\nSo, f(m)=16 +255k +1=17 +255k mod289.\n\nWe need f(m)≡0 mod289, so 17 +255k ≡0 mod289.\n\nSimplify: 255k ≡-17 mod289.\n\nBut 255 mod289 is 255, and -17 mod289 is 272.\n\nSo, 255k ≡272 mod289.\n\nWe can write this as 255k ≡272 mod289.\n\nWe need to solve for k. Since 255 and 289 are coprime? Let's check gcd(255,289). 255=5*51=5*3*17. 289=17². So, gcd(255,289)=17.\n\nBut 17 divides 272? 272/17", "answer": "110"}

The answer should be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. It's given that AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So, AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. That might mean the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.\n\nI remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I think such a tetrahedron has some special properties, like all its faces are congruent triangles, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Congruent faces would mean all edges are equal, but here only opposite edges are equal. So, maybe the faces are congruent in pairs?\n\nLet me check the edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = √41\n- AC = BD = √80\n- BC = AD = √89\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges is equal. That might mean that the tetrahedron is \"equifacial,\" meaning all faces are congruent. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Let me check if these triangles are congruent.\n\nWait, no, each face is a triangle with sides from different edges. For example, face ABC has sides AB = √41, BC = √89, and AC = √80. Similarly, face ABD has sides AB = √41, BD = √80, and AD = √89. So, actually, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That makes the tetrahedron isohedral, meaning it's face-transitive. So, all faces are congruent, and all edges are equal in pairs.\n\nThat's good to know because if all faces are congruent, the tetrahedron is quite symmetric, which might help in finding the inradius.\n\nWait, but in a tetrahedron, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each face. The incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. So, in this case, point I is the incenter, and the distance from I to each face is the inradius.\n\nSo, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron. To find the inradius, I can use the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S.\n\nFirst, let's compute the surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Let me compute the area of one such triangle.\n\nI can use Heron's formula for this. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute s for one face:\n\na = √41, b = √80, c = √89\n\ns = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the squares:\n\n41, 80, 89.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area without dealing with square roots directly. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three sides, but perhaps it's easier to use vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, another approach: since all edges are given, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume and surface area.\n\nYes, that might be a better approach because dealing with Heron's formula for each face could be cumbersome, especially with these square roots.\n\nSo, let's try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, perhaps I can set up a coordinate system where some points are easy to define.\n\nLet me try to place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, let me place point B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB is along the x-axis. Then, point C can be placed in the xy-plane, and point D somewhere in 3D space.\n\nBut given the symmetry, maybe I can choose coordinates such that the centroid is at the origin or something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to the midpoint of each pair of opposite edges.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the property that in such a tetrahedron, the midpoints of the three pairs of opposite edges are the same point, which is the centroid.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me try:\n\nLet me set point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me set point B at (a, 0, 0), so AB = a = √41.\n\nSo, a = √41.\n\nThen, point C is somewhere in the xy-plane. Let me denote it as (p, q, 0).\n\nSimilarly, point D is somewhere in 3D space, say (r, s, t).\n\nNow, given the edge lengths:\n\nAC = √80, so the distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is √(p² + q²) = √80, so p² + q² = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BD = √80, so the distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to D(r, s, t) is √[(r - √41)² + s² + t²] = √80, so (r - √41)² + s² + t² = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = √89, so the distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is √[(p - √41)² + q²] = √89, so (p - √41)² + q² = 89.\n\nSimilarly, AD = √89, so the distance from A(0,0,0) to D(r, s, t) is √(r² + s² + t²) = √89, so r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nAlso, CD = √41, so the distance from C(p, q, 0) to D(r, s, t) is √[(r - p)² + (s - q)² + t²] = √41, so (r - p)² + (s - q)² + t² = 41.\n\nSimilarly, AC = √80, which we already have, and BD = √80, which we have.\n\nSo, let's write down all the equations we have:\n\n1. AB = √41: distance from A to B is √[(√41 - 0)² + 0 + 0] = √41, which is satisfied.\n\n2. AC = √80: p² + q² = 80.\n\n3. BC = √89: (p - √41)² + q² = 89.\n\n4. BD = √80: (r - √41)² + s² + t² = 80.\n\n5. AD = √89: r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\n6. CD = √41: (r - p)² + (s - q)² + t² = 41.\n\nSo, let's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, equations 2 and 3:\n\nFrom equation 2: p² + q² = 80.\n\nFrom equation 3: (p - √41)² + q² = 89.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(p - √41)² + q² - (p² + q²) = 89 - 80\n\nExpanding (p - √41)²: p² - 2p√41 + 41.\n\nSo, p² - 2p√41 + 41 + q² - p² - q² = 9\n\nSimplify: -2p√41 + 41 = 9\n\nSo, -2p√41 = 9 - 41 = -32\n\nDivide both sides by -2√41:\n\np = (-32)/(-2√41) = 16/√41\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\np = (16√41)/41\n\nSo, p = (16√41)/41.\n\nNow, plug p back into equation 2 to find q.\n\nFrom equation 2: p² + q² = 80.\n\nCompute p²:\n\n(16√41 / 41)² = (256 * 41) / (41²) = 256 / 41.\n\nSo, 256/41 + q² = 80.\n\nThus, q² = 80 - 256/41.\n\nConvert 80 to 41 denominator: 80 = 3280/41.\n\nSo, q² = 3280/41 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024/41.\n\nThus, q = √(3024/41) = √(3024)/√41.\n\nSimplify √3024:\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7.\n\nSo, √3024 = √(16 * 9 * 3 * 7) = 4 * 3 * √(21) = 12√21.\n\nThus, q = 12√21 / √41 = (12√(21*41))/41 = (12√861)/41.\n\nWait, but 21*41 is 861, which is 3*7*41, so it's square-free. So, q = (12√861)/41.\n\nSo, point C has coordinates (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0).\n\nNow, moving on to points D.\n\nWe have equations 4, 5, and 6.\n\nEquation 4: (r - √41)² + s² + t² = 80.\n\nEquation 5: r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nEquation 6: (r - p)² + (s - q)² + t² = 41.\n\nLet me subtract equation 4 from equation 5:\n\n(r² + s² + t²) - [(r - √41)² + s² + t²] = 89 - 80\n\nSimplify:\n\nr² - (r² - 2r√41 + 41) = 9\n\nr² - r² + 2r√41 - 41 = 9\n\n2r√41 - 41 = 9\n\n2r√41 = 50\n\nr = 50 / (2√41) = 25 / √41\n\nRationalize:\n\nr = 25√41 / 41\n\nSo, r = 25√41 / 41.\n\nNow, plug r into equation 5 to find s² + t².\n\nFrom equation 5: r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nCompute r²:\n\n(25√41 / 41)² = (625 * 41) / (41²) = 625 / 41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + s² + t² = 89.\n\nThus, s² + t² = 89 - 625/41.\n\nConvert 89 to 41 denominator: 89 = 3649/41.\n\nSo, s² + t² = 3649/41 - 625/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024/41.\n\nSo, s² + t² = 3024/41.\n\nNow, let's use equation 6:\n\n(r - p)² + (s - q)² + t² = 41.\n\nWe know r, p, q, so let's compute (r - p):\n\nr = 25√41 / 41, p = 16√41 / 41.\n\nSo, r - p = (25√41 - 16√41)/41 = 9√41 / 41.\n\nThus, (r - p)² = (81 * 41) / (41²) = 81 / 41.\n\nSimilarly, (s - q)² = s² - 2sq + q².\n\nSo, equation 6 becomes:\n\n81/41 + (s² - 2sq + q²) + t² = 41.\n\nBut we know s² + t² = 3024/41, and q² = 3024/41 - p².\n\nWait, from earlier, p² = 256/41, so q² = 3", "answer": "104"}

Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic formulas related to rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say a), width (b), and height (c). The surface area (SA) of such a box is given by 2(ab + bc + ac), and the volume (V) is abc. So, in this problem, we know that SA = 54 and V = 23.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54\n2. abc = 23\n\nI can simplify the first equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives ab + bc + ac = 27.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius will be half of the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, and the sphere must at least cover that distance to contain the box entirely.\n\nThe space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is given by the formula:\n\nd = √(a² + b² + c²)\n\nTherefore, the radius (r) of the sphere will be half of that:\n\nr = d/2 = √(a² + b² + c²)/2\n\nSo, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value of r² because we need the sphere that can contain any box in the set. So, we need to maximize (a² + b² + c²)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume.\n\nWait, actually, no. Since we need the sphere to contain any box from the set, we need the maximum possible space diagonal across all such boxes. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of √(a² + b² + c²) over all boxes with SA = 54 and V = 23, and then divide that by 2 to get r, and then square it to get r².\n\nBut maybe it's easier to work directly with a² + b² + c². So, let's denote S = a² + b² + c². We need to maximize S given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have two constraints and we need to maximize S. This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but since it's a problem likely intended for high school math, maybe there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of the given constraints. Let me recall that for any three variables, we have the identity:\n\n(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nSo, if I can find (a + b + c)², I can express S in terms of that.\n\nFrom the surface area, we have ab + bc + ac = 27, so 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, which is consistent.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)² = S + 2(ab + bc + ac) = S + 54\n\nTherefore, S = (a + b + c)² - 54\n\nSo, if I can find the maximum value of (a + b + c)², then I can find the maximum S.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum of (a + b + c) given that abc = 23 and ab + bc + ac = 27?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality or some other inequality to relate these terms.\n\nWait, let's think about the relationship between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. For positive real numbers a, b, c, we have:\n\n(a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3)\n\nSo, (a + b + c) ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3)\n\nBut I don't know if that's helpful here because we have two constraints. Maybe I need to use more advanced techniques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of symmetric functions. Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, we have:\n\nxy + yz + zx = 27\n\nxyz = 23\n\nWe need to maximize x² + y² + z².\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the function to maximize:\n\nf(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z²\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\ng(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0\n\nh(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0\n\nSo, we can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)\n\nThen, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n\n2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0\n\nSimilarly, with respect to y:\n\n2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0\n\nWith respect to z:\n\n2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nxy + yz + zx = 27\n\nxyz = 23\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a symmetric solution. Let's assume that x = y = z. If that's the case, then we can solve for x.\n\nIf x = y = z, then:\n\nSurface area: 3x² = 27 => x² = 9 => x = 3\n\nVolume: x³ = 23 => x = cube root of 23 ≈ 2.843\n\nBut 3 ≠ cube root of 23, so the solution isn't symmetric. Therefore, the maximum might occur when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume that a = b ≠ c.\n\nSo, let me set a = b = x, and c = y.\n\nThen, the surface area becomes:\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(x² + 2xy) = 54\n\nSo, x² + 2xy = 27\n\nAnd the volume is x² y = 23\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x² + 2xy = 27\n\n2. x² y = 23\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y: y = 23 / x²\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nx² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + (46 / x) = 27\n\nMultiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:\n\nx³ + 46 = 27x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx³ - 27x + 46 = 0\n\nSo, we have a cubic equation: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 divided by factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.\n\nTesting x=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0\n\nx=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 → 0. So, x=2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are x=2 and solutions to x² + 2x -23=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula for x² + 2x -23=0:\n\nx = [-2 ± √(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± √96]/2 = [-2 ± 4√6]/2 = -1 ± 2√6\n\nSince x must be positive, we take x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898\n\nSo, the possible x values are 2 and -1 + 2√6.\n\nNow, let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, x=2:\n\nThen, y = 23 / x² = 23 / 4 ≈ 5.75\n\nSo, the dimensions would be a = b = 2, c ≈5.75\n\nCompute S = a² + b² + c² = 4 + 4 + (23/4)² = 8 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625\n\nAlternatively, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898\n\nThen, y = 23 / x² ≈23 / (15.19) ≈1.514\n\nSo, dimensions are a = b ≈3.898, c≈1.514\n\nCompute S = a² + b² + c² ≈ 15.19 + 15.19 + 2.29 ≈32.67\n\nWait, that's actually smaller than the previous S. So, the maximum S occurs when x=2, y=23/4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S is 41.0625, which is 657/16.\n\nWait, let me compute 23/4 squared: (23/4)^2 = 529/16. Then, 4 + 4 is 8, which is 128/16. So, 128/16 + 529/16 = 657/16.\n\nSo, S = 657/16.\n\nTherefore, r² = S / 4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.\n\nWait, 657 divided by 64. Let me check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2^6, and 657 divided by 3 is 219, which is 3*73. So, 657 = 3*3*73, and 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so p=657, q=64.\n\nTherefore, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.\n\nWait, but hold on, is this the maximum S? Because I assumed that two sides are equal. Maybe the maximum occurs when all three sides are different. Hmm, but in the case where two sides are equal, we found a critical point, but is it a maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one of the sides approaches zero, but then the volume would approach zero, which contradicts the volume being 23. So, the maximum S is indeed achieved when two sides are equal, as we found.\n\nWait, but let me verify. Suppose we have a very long and thin box with a fixed surface area and volume. The space diagonal would be maximized when the box is as elongated as possible. But in our case, with fixed surface area and volume, is the maximum space diagonal achieved when two sides are equal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the case where one side is very large, but then the other sides would have to adjust to keep the volume and surface area fixed. But I think the case where two sides are equal gives the maximum S.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case where a, b, c are all different. Maybe we can get a higher S.\n\nBut without going into more complex calculus, perhaps the maximum S is indeed 657/16, which gives r² = 657/64, so p + q = 721.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWe had x=2, y=23/4, so a = b = 2, c=23/4.\n\nCompute S = 2² + 2² + (23/4)² = 4 + 4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 657/16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I take a different approach, perhaps using the inequality between quadratic and cubic terms.\n\nWait, another thought: since we have ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23, perhaps we can use the inequality that relates these terms.\n\nI recall that for positive real numbers, (ab + bc + ac)^3 ≥ 27 a² b² c²\n\nSo, 27^3 ≥ 27 (abc)^2\n\nCompute 27^3 = 19683\n\n27*(23)^2 = 27*529 = 14283\n\nSo, 19683 ≥ 14283, which is true, so the inequality holds.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps us here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the AM-QM inequality on the terms a², b², c².\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier is correct, assuming two sides are equal, which gives us a critical point, and since the other case gives a lower S, that must be the maximum.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 657/64, so p + q = 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n</think>\n\nGiven a set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any box from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\).

Then, I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. log_x(y^x) = 10\n2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\n\nI remember that log_b(a) = c can be rewritten as b^c = a. So maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting this, it becomes x^10 = y^x. Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 becomes y^10 = x^{4y}.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x^10 = y^x\n2. y^10 = x^{4y}\n\nHmm, okay. So I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y. I need to solve for x and y. Let me see how I can manipulate these equations to find x and y.\n\nMaybe I can express both equations in terms of logarithms or exponents to find a relationship between x and y. Let me take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. If I take the natural logarithm of both sides, I can bring down the exponents.\n\nSo, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}, taking natural logs gives 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x).\n\nNow I have two new equations:\n\n1. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)  --> Let's call this Equation (3)\n2. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x) --> Let's call this Equation (4)\n\nHmm, so now I have Equations (3) and (4). Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.\n\nFrom Equation (3): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). Let me solve for ln(y):\n\nln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (4): 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x). Let me substitute ln(y) from Equation (3) into Equation (4):\n\n10 * (10 ln(x) / x) = 4y ln(x)\n\nSimplify the left side: 100 ln(x) / x = 4y ln(x)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, assuming ln(x) is not zero, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln(x) > 0. So I can divide both sides by ln(x):\n\n100 / x = 4y\n\nSo, 100 / x = 4y --> Let's solve for y:\n\ny = (100) / (4x) = 25 / x\n\nSo, y = 25 / x. That's a nice relationship between y and x. Now, I can substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x.\n\nLet me choose Equation (3): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). Since y = 25 / x, ln(y) = ln(25 / x) = ln(25) - ln(x). So substitute that into Equation (3):\n\n10 ln(x) = x [ln(25) - ln(x)]\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n10 ln(x) = x ln(25) - x ln(x)\n\nHmm, let's bring all terms to one side:\n\n10 ln(x) + x ln(x) - x ln(25) = 0\n\nFactor out ln(x) from the first two terms:\n\nln(x) (10 + x) - x ln(25) = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it differently or find a substitution.\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe I can write this as:\n\nln(x) (10 + x) = x ln(25)\n\nSo, ln(x) = [x ln(25)] / (10 + x)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express this as:\n\nln(x) = (ln(25) * x) / (x + 10)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let t = x, so that ln(t) = (ln(25) * t) / (t + 10). This seems like a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can try to find a substitution or see if x is a multiple of 25 or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the relationship y = 25 / x and substitute back into one of the original exponential equations.\n\nLet me try that. From the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Since y = 25 / x, substitute:\n\nx^10 = (25 / x)^x\n\nWhich is x^10 = 25^x / x^x\n\nMultiply both sides by x^x:\n\nx^10 * x^x = 25^x\n\nSimplify the left side: x^{10 + x} = 25^x\n\nSo, x^{x + 10} = 25^x\n\nHmm, maybe take natural logs again:\n\nln(x^{x + 10}) = ln(25^x)\n\nWhich is (x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nWait, that's the same equation I had earlier. So, I'm back to where I was.\n\nSo, (x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nLet me divide both sides by x:\n\n(1 + 10/x) ln(x) = ln(25)\n\nHmm, let me set t = x, so:\n\n(1 + 10/t) ln(t) = ln(25)\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I can try to guess a value for x that satisfies this equation.\n\nLet me try x = 25. Let's see:\n\n(1 + 10/25) ln(25) = (1 + 0.4) ln(25) = 1.4 * ln(25)\n\nCompute 1.4 * ln(25). Since ln(25) is about 3.2189, so 1.4 * 3.2189 ≈ 4.5065\n\nBut ln(25) is about 3.2189, so 4.5065 is not equal to ln(25). So x=25 is not a solution.\n\nWait, but if x=25, then y=25/25=1, but y must be greater than 1, so that's invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe x=5. Let's try x=5:\n\n(1 + 10/5) ln(5) = (1 + 2) ln(5) = 3 * ln(5) ≈ 3 * 1.6094 ≈ 4.8282\n\nCompare to ln(25) ≈ 3.2189. Not equal.\n\nHmm, 4.8282 is greater than 3.2189, so maybe x needs to be larger.\n\nWait, let's see, if x increases, what happens to the left side?\n\nLet me see, as x increases, 10/x decreases, so (1 + 10/x) approaches 1, and ln(x) increases. So the product (1 + 10/x) ln(x) increases as x increases beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but when x=25, we saw it was about 4.5065, which is still higher than ln(25). Hmm, maybe x needs to be larger than 25?\n\nWait, let's try x=50:\n\n(1 + 10/50) ln(50) = (1 + 0.2) ln(50) = 1.2 * ln(50) ≈ 1.2 * 3.9120 ≈ 4.6944\n\nStill higher than ln(25). Hmm, maybe x=100:\n\n(1 + 10/100) ln(100) = 1.1 * ln(100) ≈ 1.1 * 4.6052 ≈ 5.0657\n\nStill higher. Hmm, maybe x=10:\n\n(1 + 10/10) ln(10) = 2 * ln(10) ≈ 2 * 2.3026 ≈ 4.6052\n\nStill higher than ln(25). Hmm, maybe x=15:\n\n(1 + 10/15) ln(15) ≈ (1 + 0.6667) * 2.7080 ≈ 1.6667 * 2.7080 ≈ 4.5133\n\nStill higher. Hmm, x=20:\n\n(1 + 10/20) ln(20) = 1.5 * ln(20) ≈ 1.5 * 2.9957 ≈ 4.4936\n\nStill higher. Hmm, x=22:\n\n(1 + 10/22) ln(22) ≈ (1 + 0.4545) * 3.0910 ≈ 1.4545 * 3.0910 ≈ 4.490\n\nStill higher. Hmm, x=23:\n\n(1 + 10/23) ln(23) ≈ (1 + 0.4348) * 3.1355 ≈ 1.4348 * 3.1355 ≈ 4.500\n\nHmm, getting close. x=24:\n\n(1 + 10/24) ln(24) ≈ (1 + 0.4167) * 3.1781 ≈ 1.4167 * 3.1781 ≈ 4.500\n\nWait, so at x=24, the left side is approximately 4.5, which is close to ln(25)≈3.2189? Wait, no, 4.5 is not close to 3.2189. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the equation is (x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25). So, when x=24, left side is (24 + 10) ln(24) = 34 * 3.1781 ≈ 107.055, and right side is 24 * ln(25) ≈ 24 * 3.2189 ≈ 77.254. Not equal.\n\nWait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the equation is (x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25). So, when I plug in x=24, it's (24 + 10) ln(24) = 34 * 3.1781 ≈ 107.055, and x ln(25) = 24 * 3.2189 ≈ 77.254. So, 107.055 ≈ 77.254? No, that's not equal.\n\nWait, so maybe I need a different approach. Maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n(x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\n(x + 10) ln(x) - x ln(25) = 0\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ln(x) - ln(25)] + 10 ln(x) = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:\n\n(x + 10) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nDivide both sides by x:\n\n(1 + 10/x) ln(x) = ln(25)\n\nLet me set t = x, so:\n\n(1 + 10/t) ln(t) = ln(25)\n\nHmm, maybe I can let u = ln(t), so t = e^u. Then, substituting:\n\n(1 + 10/e^u) * u = ln(25)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can use substitution or another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(x) = (x + 10) ln(x) - x ln(25) and find its root.\n\nLet me compute f(x) for various x:\n\nAt x=10: f(10) = 20 ln(10) - 10 ln(25) ≈ 20*2.3026 - 10*3.2189 ≈ 46.052 - 32.189 ≈ 13.863\n\nAt x=20: f(20) = 30 ln(20) - 20 ln(25) ≈ 30*2.9957 - 20*3.2189 ≈ 89.871 - 64.378 ≈ 25.493\n\nAt x=5: f(5) = 15 ln(5) - 5 ln(25) ≈ 15*1.6094 - 5*3.2189 ≈ 24.141 - 16.094 ≈ 8.047\n\nAt x=25: f(25) = 35 ln(25) - 25 ln(25) = 10 ln(25) ≈ 10*3.2189 ≈ 32.189\n\nWait, but f(x) is increasing as x increases? Because when x increases, (x + 10) ln(x) increases faster", "answer": "25"}

Alice goes first, and each turn a player can remove either 1 or 4 stones. The person who takes the last stone wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can force a win, no matter what Alice does.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's denote the positions as either P-positions (previous player can force a win) or N-positions (next player can force a win). Wait, actually, in standard terminology, P-positions are those where the previous move was decisive, meaning the next player is in a losing position. So, if a position is a P-position, the player about to move is in a losing position if both players play optimally.\n\nSo, our goal is to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a P-position, meaning Bob can force a win.\n\nTo find these P-positions, we can analyze the game starting from small n and look for a pattern.\n\nLet's start by listing the positions and determining if they are P or N.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are no stones left, the game is over. So, this is a losing position because the player cannot make a move. So, n=0 is a P-position.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 stone and win. So, n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1 stone, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can the player take 4 stones? No, because there are only 2. So, the only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position. Wait, but if the opponent is faced with n=1, they can win. So, n=2 is a P-position? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2 is a position where the current player can only move to n=1, which is an N-position, meaning the opponent can win. So, n=2 is a P-position? Wait, no, actually, if all moves from a position lead to N-positions, then that position is a P-position. Wait, no, I think I got it backwards.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- If from a position, all possible moves lead to N-positions, then the current position is a P-position.\n\n- If from a position, there exists at least one move leading to a P-position, then the current position is an N-position.\n\nSo, starting from n=0:\n\nn=0: P-position (losing)\n\nn=1: From 1, you can move to 0 (P). So, since there's a move to a P-position, n=1 is N.\n\nn=2: From 2, you can move to 1 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=2 is P.\n\nn=3: From 3, you can move to 2 (P) or 3-4 is negative, so only move to 2. Since 2 is P, n=3 is N.\n\nn=4: From 4, you can move to 0 (P) or 3 (N). Since there's a move to P, n=4 is N.\n\nn=5: From 5, you can move to 1 (N) or 4 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=5 is P.\n\nn=6: From 6, you can move to 2 (P) or 5 (P). Wait, moving to 2 is P, so n=6 is N.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nn | Moves | P or N\n---|-------|-------\n0 | - | P\n1 | 0 | N\n2 | 1 | P\n3 | 2 | N\n4 | 0, 3 | N (since moving to 0 is P, but moving to 3 is N. Wait, no, if any move leads to P, then current is N. So, since moving to 0 (P) is possible, n=4 is N.\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct my approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- If from n, all moves lead to N, then n is P.\n\n- If from n, at least one move leads to P, then n is N.\n\nSo, starting from n=0:\n\nn=0: P\n\nn=1: can move to 0 (P). So, n=1 is N.\n\nn=2: can move to 1 (N). So, n=2 is P.\n\nn=3: can move to 2 (P). So, n=3 is N.\n\nn=4: can move to 0 (P) or 3 (N). Since moving to 0 is P, n=4 is N.\n\nn=5: can move to 1 (N) or 4 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=5 is P.\n\nn=6: can move to 2 (P) or 5 (P). So, moving to 2 or 5, both P. So, n=6 is N.\n\nWait, but if from n=6, you can move to 2 or 5, both P, so n=6 is N.\n\nWait, but n=5 is P, so from n=6, moving to 5 (P) would mean the opponent is in a losing position. So, n=6 is N.\n\nn=7: can move to 3 (N) or 6 (N). So, n=7 is P.\n\nWait, n=7: moves to 3 (N) or 6 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=7 is P.\n\nn=8: can move to 4 (N) or 7 (P). Since moving to 7 (P) is possible, n=8 is N.\n\nn=9: can move to 5 (P) or 8 (N). Since moving to 5 (P) is possible, n=9 is N.\n\nn=10: can move to 6 (N) or 9 (N). So, n=10 is P.\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\nn | P/N\n---|---\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10 | P\n\nHmm, so looking at this, the P-positions seem to be at n=0,2,5,7,10,...\n\nLet me see the differences between them:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n\n2 to 5: +3\n\n5 to 7: +2\n\n7 to 10: +3\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Wait, let's check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod 5 =0\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2\n\nWait, so P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let's check n=12.\n\nn=12: can move to 8 (N) or 11 (N). So, n=12 is P.\n\nYes, 12 mod5=2.\n\nSimilarly, n=15:15 mod5=0. Let's check n=15.\n\nFrom 15, you can move to 11 (N) or 14 (N). So, n=15 is P.\n\nSo, seems like P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's check n=13.\n\nn=13: can move to 9 (N) or 12 (P). So, since moving to 12 (P) is possible, n=13 is N.\n\nSimilarly, n=14: can move to 10 (P) or 13 (N). So, n=14 is N.\n\nn=15: as above, P.\n\nSo, the pattern is that every 5 numbers, the P-positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a P-position, i.e., n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of such n ≤2024 is equal to the number of integers ≤2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and ≡2 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5*404=2020). So, 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers ≡2 mod5: The first is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.\n\nWhat's the largest number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022. So, 2022 is the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic progression with first term 2, common difference5.\n\nNumber of terms: Let's compute.\n\nNumber of terms = ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, 405 numbers ≡2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, total P-positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, numbers ≡0 mod5: from5,10,...,2020. So, 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nNumbers ≡2 mod5: from2,7,...,2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, n must be positive integers, so n=0 is excluded. So, in our case, n starts from1, so n=0 is not counted. So, our counts above are correct because for ≡0 mod5, the first term is5, and for ≡2 mod5, the first term is2.\n\nTherefore, the total number is809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024.\n\n2024 mod5: 2024 divided by5 is404*5=2020, remainder4. So, 2024≡4 mod5. So, the last number ≡2 mod5 is2022, as above.\n\nSo, yes, 405 numbers ≡2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, total P-positions:404 +405=809.\n\nHence, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is809.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can force a win is \\boxed{809}.\n</think>\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game with \\( n \\) stones where each player can remove either 1 or 4 stones on their turn. The player who takes the last stone wins. We need to find the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can force a win.\n\nTo determine this, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory, classifying positions as either winning (N-positions) or losing (P-positions). A P-position is one where the previous player can force a win, meaning the current player is in a losing position.\n\nBy examining small values of \\( n \\) and determining if they are P-positions or N-positions, we observe a pattern. The P-positions are those where \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nTo find the number of such \\( n \\) values up to 2024:\n1. Count the numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. There are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\) such numbers.\n2. Count the numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The number of terms is calculated as \\( \\left( \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right) + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these, we get the total number of P-positions:\n\\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can force a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).", "answer": "809"}

Najděte $m+n$.", "response": "Alright, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nJen is participating in a lottery where she picks 4 different numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. So, she's choosing 4 distinct numbers from 1 to 10. Then, 4 numbers are randomly selected from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four randomly selected. She wins the main prize if all four of her numbers are among the four randomly selected. \n\nThe question is asking for the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has already won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers. We need to find m + n.\n\nOkay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n\nIn this context, event A is Jen winning the main prize, and event B is Jen winning any prize. So, we need to find the probability that she wins the main prize given that she has won at least two numbers.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what P(B) is, the probability that she wins at least two numbers. Then, P(A ∩ B) is actually just P(A), because if she wins the main prize, she definitely wins at least two numbers. So, P(A ∩ B) = P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability simplifies to P(A) / P(B).\n\nSo, let's compute P(A) and P(B).\n\nFirst, let's compute the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10, 4), which is 210.\n\nNow, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are among the four selected. Since Jen has chosen 4 specific numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (because only one combination matches exactly her numbers). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10, 4) = 1 / 210.\n\nNext, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four selected. To compute this, it's easier to calculate the complement probability: the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are selected, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are selected. Then, subtract this from 1 to get P(B).\n\nSo, let's compute the number of ways that none of Jen's numbers are selected. That would be choosing all 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen has 4, so 10 - 4 = 6). The number of ways is C(6, 4) = 15.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways that exactly one of Jen's numbers is selected. We choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 not chosen. So, that's C(4, 1) * C(6, 3). Calculating that: C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20, so 4 * 20 = 80.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unfavorable outcomes (where Jen gets fewer than two numbers) is 15 + 80 = 95.\n\nHence, the number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is total outcomes minus unfavorable, which is 210 - 95 = 115.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.\n\nSimplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So, P(B) = 23/42.\n\nNow, going back to the conditional probability:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42)\n\nDividing these fractions: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23). Let's compute that:\n\n42 divided by 210 is 1/5. So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115.\n\nSo, P(A | B) = 1/115.\n\nBut wait, that seems low. Let me verify my steps.\n\nFirst, total number of possible combinations: C(10,4) = 210. That's correct.\n\nNumber of ways Jen can win the main prize: 1. So, P(A) = 1/210. Correct.\n\nNumber of ways Jen can win nothing: C(6,4) = 15. Correct.\n\nNumber of ways Jen can win exactly one number: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80. Correct.\n\nTotal unfavorable: 15 + 80 = 95. So, favorable for B: 210 - 95 = 115. So, P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42. Correct.\n\nThen, P(A | B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, 1/115 is approximately 0.0087, which is about 0.87%. That seems low, but considering that winning the main prize is a very specific case, it might make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, instead of computing probabilities, maybe compute the conditional probability directly using combinations.\n\nGiven that Jen has 4 numbers, and 4 are drawn. We want the probability that all 4 are drawn, given that at least 2 are drawn.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is the number of favorable cases (all 4 drawn) divided by the number of cases where at least 2 are drawn.\n\nNumber of favorable cases: 1 (only one case where all 4 are drawn).\n\nNumber of cases where at least 2 are drawn: total cases - cases with 0 or 1.\n\nTotal cases: C(10,4) = 210.\n\nCases with 0: C(6,4) = 15.\n\nCases with 1: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80.\n\nSo, cases with at least 2: 210 - 15 - 80 = 115.\n\nTherefore, conditional probability is 1 / 115. So, same result.\n\nSo, m = 1, n = 115. They are coprime since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them.\n\nTherefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nWait, but 115 is 5*23, so 1 and 115 are coprime. So, yes, m = 1, n = 115, so m + n = 116.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the conditional probability correctly calculated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of hypergeometric distribution.\n\nWe have a population of 10 numbers, 4 \"successes\" (Jen's numbers), and 6 \"failures\". We draw 4 numbers without replacement. We want the probability that we have exactly 4 successes (main prize) given that we have at least 2 successes.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is P(X=4 | X ≥ 2).\n\nWhich is equal to P(X=4) / P(X ≥ 2).\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, P(X=4) is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.\n\nP(X ≥ 2) is 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1) = 1 - 15/210 - 80/210 = 1 - 95/210 = 115/210.\n\nSo, P(X=4 | X ≥ 2) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nWait, but 115 is 5*23, and 1 is coprime with everything, so yes, 1 and 115 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 116.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it another way.\n\nSuppose Jen has 4 numbers. The lottery draws 4 numbers. What is the probability that all 4 are drawn, given that at least 2 are drawn.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as: given that at least 2 of Jen's numbers are in the lottery's 4, what's the chance that all 4 are.\n\nSo, the number of possible lottery draws that include all 4 of Jen's numbers is 1.\n\nThe number of possible lottery draws that include at least 2 of Jen's numbers is 115, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/115.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think 116 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}\n</think>\n\nJen is participating in a lottery where she picks 4 different numbers from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9, 10\\} \\). The lottery randomly selects 4 numbers from \\( S \\). Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four selected, and she wins the main prize if all four of her numbers are selected. We need to find the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has already won a prize.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \\( S \\), which is \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\).\n\nThe probability that Jen wins the main prize (event \\( A \\)) is the number of favorable outcomes (1) divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\\[ P(A) = \\frac{1}{210} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers (event \\( B \\)). We use the complement rule to find the probability of the complement event (fewer than two numbers):\n- The number of ways to choose 0 numbers from Jen's 4 is \\( \\binom{6}{4} = 15 \\).\n- The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6 is \\( \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of unfavorable outcomes is \\( 15 + 80 = 95 \\). The number of favorable outcomes for event \\( B \\) is \\( 210 - 95 = 115 \\).

The problem says that points D, E, C, F are colinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so it's a longer rectangle with length 184 and width 17.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are colinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, point D is one of its vertices, and point C is the opposite vertex. Then, points E and F are somewhere on the line that passes through D and C. Similarly, rectangle EFGH is attached in such a way that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circle.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD: A is connected to B, B to C, C to D, and D back to A. Rectangle EFGH: E connected to F, F to G, G to H, and H back to E. Points D, E, C, F are on a straight line, so E and F must be on the line extending from D through C.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are on a circle, that suggests that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which might help us use some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use the power of a point or some similar triangle properties here.\n\nLet me denote some coordinates to make this more concrete. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 16), because AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, moving from D(0,0) to C(107,16).\n\nPoints E and F are on the line DC extended beyond C. So, the line DC goes from D(0,0) to C(107,16). Let me find the equation of this line. The slope of DC is (16 - 0)/(107 - 0) = 16/107. So, the equation is y = (16/107)x.\n\nPoints E and F lie on this line. Let me denote E as (e, (16/107)e) and F as (f, (16/107)f). Since E and F are on the line DC extended beyond C, which is at (107,16), so E must be between D and C, or beyond C? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are colinear, so the order could be D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's D-E-C-F, meaning E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.\n\nBut wait, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length of the rectangle, which is 184, and FG is the width, 17. So, EF is the longer side.\n\nIf E and F are on DC, then EF is a segment on DC. But DC has length sqrt(107^2 + 16^2). Let me compute that: 107^2 is 11449, 16^2 is 256, so DC is sqrt(11449 + 256) = sqrt(11705). Let me compute sqrt(11705). Hmm, 108^2 is 11664, so sqrt(11705) is approximately 108.19. So, DC is about 108.19 units long.\n\nBut EF is 184, which is longer than DC. So, that suggests that E and F are not between D and C, but rather, E is beyond D, and F is beyond C. Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are colinear. So, the order could be D-E-C-F, meaning E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. But then EF would be longer than DC, which is about 108, but EF is 184, which is longer. So, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is beyond D, and F is beyond C, so the order is E-D-C-F. Then, EF would be ED + DC + CF. But ED is some length, DC is 108, and CF is some length. But EF is 184, so ED + DC + CF = 184. But DC is 108, so ED + CF = 184 - 108 = 76. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is on the extension beyond D, and F is on the extension beyond C, so that E and F are on the same line beyond D and C respectively. Then, the distance between E and F would be ED + DC + CF. But since EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is about 108, so ED + CF = 184 - 108 = 76.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the power of a point. Since A, D, H, G are on a circle, the power of point A with respect to the circle should satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, point A is connected to D, which is on the circle, and also to H and G, which are also on the circle. So, maybe triangle ADG is related to something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to all the points.\n\nLet me set point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C is at (107,16). Point A is at (0,16), and point B is at (107,16). Wait, no, hold on. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is 107, BC is 16. So, starting from A, moving to B (107 units right), then to C (16 units up), then to D (107 units left), then back to A (16 units down). So, coordinates would be:\n\n- A: (0,16)\n- B: (107,16)\n- C: (107,0)\n- D: (0,0)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because AB is 107, BC is 16, so from B(107,16) moving down 16 units to C(107,0), then back to D(0,0), and then up to A(0,16). So, that's the rectangle.\n\nSo, points D(0,0), C(107,0), B(107,16), A(0,16).\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH: points E, F, G, H. EF = 184, FG = 17. So, EF is the longer side, FG is the shorter side.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are colinear. So, E and F are on the line DC, which is the line from D(0,0) to C(107,0). Wait, but in my coordinate system, DC is from (0,0) to (107,0), which is the x-axis. So, points E and F are on the x-axis.\n\nBut EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is 107. So, that suggests that E and F are on the x-axis, but beyond D and C. So, E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C.\n\nSo, let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since E and F are on the x-axis, and EF = 184, so the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184.\n\nSince D is at (0,0), and C is at (107,0), E is to the left of D, so e < 0, and F is to the right of C, so f > 107. So, the distance from E to D is |e - 0| = |e|, and from D to C is 107, and from C to F is |f - 107|.\n\nSo, the total distance from E to F is |f - e| = 184. Since E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C, f - e = 184.\n\nBut also, the distance from E to D is |e|, and from D to C is 107, and from C to F is f - 107. So, the total distance from E to F is |e| + 107 + (f - 107) = |e| + f. But since e is negative, |e| = -e. So, |e| + f = 184. Therefore, -e + f = 184.\n\nSo, we have f = e + 184.\n\nBut also, since E is on the x-axis, and F is on the x-axis, and EF = 184, we can write f = e + 184.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, from point F, moving up 17 units to G, and then left 184 units to H, and then down 17 units to E? Wait, no, because EFGH is a rectangle, so from F, moving in the direction perpendicular to EF. Since EF is along the x-axis, FG would be vertical.\n\nSo, from F(f, 0), moving up 17 units to G(f,17), then moving left 184 units to H(f - 184,17), then moving down 17 units to E(f - 184, 0). Wait, but E is at (e,0). So, E is at (f - 184, 0). Therefore, e = f - 184.\n\nBut earlier, we had f = e + 184. So, substituting e = f - 184 into f = e + 184, we get f = (f - 184) + 184, which simplifies to f = f. So, that's consistent, but doesn't give us new information.\n\nSo, we need another condition. The key is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.\n\nPoint A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (f - 184,17), and G is at (f,17). So, these four points lie on a circle.\n\nTo find the condition for four points to lie on a circle, we can use the cyclic quadrilateral condition. Alternatively, we can plug the coordinates into the general equation of a circle and solve for the parameters.\n\nLet me recall that the general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. If four points lie on this circle, they must satisfy the equation.\n\nSo, plugging in point A(0,16):\n\n0^2 + 16^2 + 2g*0 + 2f*16 + c = 0\n256 + 32f + c = 0 --> Equation 1: 32f + c = -256\n\nPoint D(0,0):\n\n0^2 + 0^2 + 2g*0 + 2f*0 + c = 0\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 --> c = 0\n\nWait, from point D, we get c = 0. Then, from point A, 32f + c = -256, so 32f = -256, so f = -8.\n\nSo, now we have f = -8 and c = 0.\n\nNow, let's plug in point H(f - 184,17). Let me denote H as (h_x, 17), where h_x = f - 184.\n\nSo, plugging H into the circle equation:\n\nh_x^2 + 17^2 + 2g*h_x + 2*(-8)*17 + 0 = 0\nh_x^2 + 289 + 2g*h_x - 272 = 0\nh_x^2 + 2g*h_x + 17 = 0 --> Equation 2: h_x^2 + 2g*h_x + 17 = 0\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G(f,17) into the circle equation:\n\nf^2 + 17^2 + 2g*f + 2*(-8)*17 + 0 = 0\nf^2 + 289 + 2g*f - 272 = 0\nf^2 + 2g*f + 17 = 0 --> Equation 3: f^2 + 2g*f + 17 = 0\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\nEquation 2: h_x^2 + 2g*h_x + 17 = 0\n\nEquation 3: f^2 + 2g*f + 17 = 0\n\nBut h_x = f - 184, so let's substitute h_x in Equation 2:\n\n(f - 184)^2 + 2g*(f - 184) + 17 = 0", "answer": "104"}

The paths have to be of length 16, which makes sense because in an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite corner requires 7 moves right and 7 moves up, totaling 14 moves. Wait, hold on, that's only 14, not 16. Hmm, maybe the grid is 9x9? Because moving from (0,0) to (8,8) would require 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16. That must be it. So the grid is 9x9, with 8x8 squares.\n\nNow, the problem says the paths must change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or vice versa. So, each time the direction changes, it's a new segment. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, that's two changes. So, if we have exactly four changes, that means the path alternates directions four times.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. Since we have to go from the bottom-left to the top-right, we need 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of paths without any restrictions is C(16,8) = 12870. But we need to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.\n\nChanging direction exactly four times means that the path alternates between R and U four times. So, the number of direction changes is four, which implies that the path has five segments. For example, RRUURRUU has three direction changes, but we need four, so it would be something like RURURURU, which has seven segments, but that's too many. Wait, no, each direction change increases the number of segments by one. So, four direction changes would result in five segments.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If you start with R, then each time you change direction, you add a new segment. So, starting with R, one change would make it R U R, which is three segments, two direction changes. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. So, the path would have five segments, alternating between R and U.\n\nBut since we have to end at the top-right corner, the last segment must be in the direction that gets us there. So, if we start with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, if we start with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U. So, the number of segments is five, alternating between R and U, starting with either R or U.\n\nTherefore, the path must consist of five segments, alternating directions, starting with either R or U. So, the number of such paths would be the sum of paths starting with R and paths starting with U, each with exactly four direction changes.\n\nBut wait, in an 8x8 grid, we need 8 R's and 8 U's. If we have five segments, starting with R, the number of R segments would be three and U segments would be two, or vice versa. Wait, no, starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments. Similarly, starting with U, it would be three U segments and two R segments.\n\nBut in both cases, the total number of R's and U's must be 8 each. So, if we have three R segments, each consisting of some number of R's, and two U segments, each consisting of some number of U's, such that the total R's are 8 and U's are 8.\n\nSimilarly, starting with U, we have three U segments and two R segments.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for the R segments (starting with R) and 2 parts for the U segments (starting with U). Similarly, for starting with U, it's compositions of 8 into 3 parts for U and 2 parts for R.\n\nThe number of compositions of n into k parts is C(n-1, k-1). So, for starting with R, the number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 segments is C(7,2) = 21, and the number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 segments is C(7,1) = 7. So, the total number of paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nSimilarly, starting with U, the number of ways to split 8 U's into 3 segments is C(7,2) = 21, and the number of ways to split 8 R's into 2 segments is C(7,1) = 7. So, the total number of paths starting with U is also 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nTherefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each composition corresponds to the number of ways to split the steps into segments. For example, starting with R, we have three R segments and two U segments. The number of ways to split 8 R's into three segments is the number of ways to place two dividers among the 7 gaps between R's, which is C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for U's, splitting into two segments is C(7,1) = 7. So, 21 * 7 = 147. Same for starting with U.\n\nSo, adding both cases, 147 + 147 = 294. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that each path with four direction changes is a sequence of five segments, alternating R and U, starting with either R or U. The number of such sequences is 2 (starting with R or U). For each starting direction, the number of ways is the product of the number of compositions of 8 into 3 and 2 parts, as above.\n\nYes, so 2 * (C(7,2) * C(7,1)) = 2 * (21 * 7) = 294.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 294.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to model this? Maybe using the concept of runs. Each time the direction changes, it's a new run. So, four direction changes mean five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.\n\nSo, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to arrange five runs, alternating between R and U, starting with either R or U, such that the total number of R's and U's is 8 each.\n\nSo, if starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. The number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs is C(7,2) = 21, and 8 U's into two runs is C(7,1) = 7. So, 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nSimilarly, starting with U, it's three U runs and two R runs. So, 21 * 7 = 147. Total 294.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using generating functions or recursive counting, but I think the composition approach is solid here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 294.\n</think>\n\nThe number of paths is calculated by considering paths that start with either right or up, alternating four times, resulting in five segments. Each segment's steps are split into parts, and the number of ways to split 8 steps into 3 and 2 parts is computed using combinations. Summing both starting directions gives the total number of paths.\n\n\\boxed{294}", "answer": "294"}

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( z \\) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. So, I can represent \\( z \\) in polar form as \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \\( \\theta \\).\n\nLet me write \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Then, \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) would be \\( \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} \\) because the magnitude of \\( z \\) is 4, so the magnitude of \\( 1/z \\) is \\( 1/4 \\).\n\nNow, substituting \\( z \\) into the expression, I get:\n\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nFirst term: \\( (75 + 117i) \\cdot 4 = 300 + 468i \\)\nSecond term: \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let me recall that for a complex number \\( a e^{i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( a \\cos\\theta \\). Similarly, the real part of \\( b e^{-i\\theta} \\) is \\( b \\cos\\theta \\).\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If I have \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\), the real part is the real part of \\( (300 + 468i) \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\). Hmm, no, that's not quite right. I need to compute the real part of the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Let me write \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, expanding the first term:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\)\n= \\( 300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta + 468i^2\\sin\\theta \\)\n= \\( 300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\nBecause \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, expanding the second term:\n\n\\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\)\n= \\( 24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta \\)\n= \\( 24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nAgain, since \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine the real and imaginary parts from both terms.\n\nFirst, the real parts:\n\nFrom the first expansion: \\( 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\nFrom the second expansion: \\( 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nTotal real part: \\( (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta \\)\n= \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nNow, the imaginary parts:\n\nFrom the first expansion: \\( 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta \\)\nFrom the second expansion: \\( -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta \\)\nTotal imaginary part: \\( (300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta \\)\n= \\( 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary part. So, the real part of the entire expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum value of \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of \\( A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta \\) is \\( \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\).\n\nWait, actually, in this case, it's \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), so \\( A = 324 \\) and \\( B = -432 \\). So, the maximum value is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute \\( 324^2 \\):\n324 * 324: Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, and 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, \\( 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is \\( \\sqrt{291,600} \\). Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, \\( \\sqrt{291,600} = 540 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 324 and 432 are both multiples of 108. Let me see:\n\n324 = 108 * 3, 432 = 108 * 4. So, 324^2 + 432^2 = (108)^2*(3^2 + 4^2) = 11,664*(9 + 16) = 11,664*25 = 291,600. Yep, that's correct. So, sqrt(291,600) is indeed 540.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when expanding the terms. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal expression: \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\]\n\nExpressed as: \\( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nThen, expanding each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\)\nSecond term: \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nThen, expanding both:\n\nFirst term: \\( 300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\nSecond term: \\( 24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nAdding real parts:\n\n300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ + 36sinθ = (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36)sinθ = 324cosθ - 432sinθ\n\nImaginary parts: 300sinθ + 468cosθ -24sinθ + 36cosθ = (300 -24)sinθ + (468 + 36)cosθ = 276sinθ + 504cosθ\n\nSo, yes, the real part is 324cosθ - 432sinθ, which we found has a maximum of 540.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this the maximum possible real part? Or is there a possibility that the maximum occurs at a different θ?\n\nWait, no, because the expression 324cosθ - 432sinθ is a sinusoidal function, and its maximum is indeed the amplitude, which is sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the expression as a function of z, and use calculus or optimization techniques. But since we've already transformed it into a sinusoidal function, and found the amplitude, which gives the maximum value, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum real part is \\boxed{540}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\), we start by representing \\( z \\) in polar form as \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\nSimplifying the constants, we have:\n\\[\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term using Euler's formula \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\), we get:\n\\[\n(300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and combining the real parts, we have:\n\\[\n300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n= (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n= 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nThe maximum value of the expression \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) is the amplitude of the sinusoidal function, which is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum real part is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).", "answer": "540"}

Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says: \"Osm kruhů o poloměru 34 je postupně tečných a dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC trojúhelníku ABC.\" Hmm, that's Czech for \"Eight circles of radius 34 are tangent and two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC.\" So, I think it means that there are eight circles, each with radius 34, that are tangent to the sides of triangle ABC, and two of these circles are specifically tangent to sides AB and BC.\n\nThen it says: \"2024 kruhů o poloměru 1 může být uspořádáno stejným způsobem.\" Which translates to \"2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same way.\" So, the same configuration that allows eight circles of radius 34 to be tangent to the triangle's sides also allows 2024 circles of radius 1 to be arranged similarly.\n\nThe question is asking for the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and then to find m + n.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC. The inradius is the radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle, tangent to all three sides. But here, we have multiple circles tangent to the sides, so maybe it's related to some kind of circle packing or something similar.\n\nLet me think. If there are eight circles of radius 34 tangent to the triangle, and 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged similarly, perhaps the triangle is similar in both cases, scaled by some factor.\n\nWait, if the configuration is the same, then the triangle must be similar in both cases, just scaled differently. So, the ratio of the radii of the circles would be the same as the ratio of the inradii of the triangles? Or maybe the scaling factor is related to the number of circles?\n\nWait, but the number of circles is different: 8 vs. 2024. Hmm, 2024 is 8 multiplied by 253, right? 8 * 253 = 2024. So, maybe the scaling factor is 253? Because 2024 is 253 times 8.\n\nBut let me think more carefully. If the configuration is the same, then the number of circles might relate to the inradius. Maybe the inradius is proportional to the number of circles? Or perhaps the number of circles relates to the area or something else.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the circles are arranged in a way similar to the incircle, but smaller. So, if you have multiple circles tangent to two sides of the triangle, their radii might be related to the inradius.\n\nWait, in a triangle, the inradius is the radius of the circle tangent to all three sides. But here, we have circles tangent to two sides each, and maybe also tangent to each other? Or perhaps tangent to the incircle?\n\nWait, the problem says \"postupně tečných a dva z kruhů jsou tečné k AB a BC.\" So, maybe the circles are arranged in a chain, each tangent to AB and BC, and also tangent to each other? So, like a row of circles along the angle bisector of angle B, each tangent to AB and BC, and also tangent to the previous and next circle.\n\nIf that's the case, then the radii of these circles would form a geometric progression, with each subsequent circle having a radius scaled by some factor.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's mentioned that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same way. So, if 8 circles of radius 34 can be arranged in that configuration, then 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged similarly, meaning the scaling factor is consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the ratio between the radii is the same as the ratio between the number of circles? Wait, 2024 is 253 times 8, so maybe the scaling factor is 253? So, if 8 circles of radius 34 correspond to 2024 circles of radius 1, then 34 * 253 = 1? Wait, 34 * 253 is 8602, which is not 1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. If 8 circles of radius 34 correspond to 2024 circles of radius 1, then the scaling factor is 1/34, and 2024 is 8 * 253, so 253 is the scaling factor in terms of the number of circles. So, perhaps the inradius scales by 253? Or maybe the inradius is 253 times the radius of the small circles.\n\nWait, let me think about the configuration. If you have multiple circles tangent to two sides of a triangle, their radii are related to the distance from the vertex. So, for a right triangle, the radii of circles tangent to two legs would form a geometric progression, each scaled by a factor depending on the angle.\n\nBut in this case, it's a general triangle, not necessarily right-angled. So, maybe the radii of the circles tangent to two sides AB and BC would form a geometric progression, with each radius being a multiple of the previous one.\n\nWait, in a triangle, the radii of circles tangent to two sides can be related to the inradius. If you have a circle tangent to AB and BC, its radius would be r * (1 - k), where k is some factor depending on the angle at B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to recall some formula or theorem related to circles tangent to two sides of a triangle.\n\nWait, I remember that in a triangle, the radius of a circle tangent to two sides can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angles. Specifically, for a circle tangent to sides AB and BC, its radius would be r / (1 + sin(B/2)), or something like that.\n\nWait, let me check. If you have a circle tangent to two sides of a triangle, the radius can be related to the inradius and the angle between the sides.\n\nYes, I think the formula is r_i = r / (1 + sin(θ/2)), where θ is the angle at the vertex where the two sides meet.\n\nSo, in this case, for circles tangent to AB and BC, which meet at vertex B, the radius of each such circle would be r / (1 + sin(B/2)).\n\nBut wait, if we have multiple circles tangent to AB and BC, each subsequent circle would be smaller, right? So, maybe the radii form a geometric sequence.\n\nSo, if the first circle has radius r1, the next one r2 = r1 * k, where k is some scaling factor, and so on.\n\nGiven that, if we have n circles, each tangent to AB and BC, their radii would be r, r*k, r*k^2, ..., r*k^{n-1}.\n\nThe sum of their radii would be r*(1 - k^n)/(1 - k) = total something?\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's not the sum of radii, but the number of circles. So, maybe the number of circles is related to the inradius.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 8 circles of radius 34 can be arranged in the same way as 2024 circles of radius 1. So, the configuration is the same, meaning the scaling factor is consistent.\n\nSo, if 8 circles of radius 34 correspond to 2024 circles of radius 1, then the scaling factor is 34:1, but 2024 is 8*253, so 253 is the scaling factor in terms of the number of circles.\n\nWait, maybe the inradius is 253 times the radius of the small circles? Because 2024 is 8*253, so if 8 circles correspond to 253 circles, then the inradius would be scaled by 253.\n\nBut wait, the inradius is a single circle, so maybe the inradius is 253 times the radius of the small circles, which are 1, so the inradius would be 253.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If 8 circles of radius 34 are arranged in the same way as 2024 circles of radius 1, then the ratio of the radii is 34:1, and the number of circles is 8:2024, which is 1:253.\n\nSo, perhaps the inradius is 253 times the radius of the small circles, so 253*1=253.\n\nBut wait, the inradius is a single circle, but the problem mentions 8 circles of radius 34 and 2024 circles of radius 1. So, maybe the inradius is 253, because 2024 is 253*8, so 253 is the scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inradius is 253, because the number of circles is scaled by 253, so the inradius is 253.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that the configuration consists of circles tangent to two sides of the triangle and each other. So, starting from the vertex, the first circle has radius r1, the next one r2, and so on, each tangent to the previous one and the two sides.\n\nIn such a case, the radii form a geometric progression. The ratio between consecutive radii is constant.\n\nSo, if the first radius is r, the next is r*k, then r*k^2, etc.\n\nGiven that, the radii are r, rk, rk^2, ..., rk^{n-1}.\n\nThe sum of these radii would be r*(1 - k^n)/(1 - k).\n\nBut in the problem, it's not the sum, but the number of circles. So, if 8 circles of radius 34 can be arranged in the same way as 2024 circles of radius 1, then the ratio of the radii is 34:1, and the number of circles is 8:2024, which is 1:253.\n\nSo, perhaps the scaling factor is 253, meaning that the inradius is 253 times the radius of the small circles.\n\nSince the small circles have radius 1, the inradius would be 253*1=253.\n\nBut wait, the inradius is a single circle, but the problem mentions multiple circles. So, maybe the inradius is 253, and the small circles are arranged in a similar configuration, each tangent to two sides and each other, with 2024 of them.\n\nSo, if the inradius is 253, then the small circles have radius 1, and 2024 of them can fit in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is 253, so m=253, n=1, so m + n=254.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf the inradius is 253, then the circles tangent to two sides would have radii decreasing by a factor each time. So, starting from 253, the next circle would have radius 253*k, then 253*k^2, etc.\n\nBut in the problem, the circles have radius 34 and 1. So, 34 is much smaller than 253, and 1 is even smaller.\n\nWait, maybe the inradius is 253, and the circles tangent to two sides have radii 34 and 1, which are scaled down by factors.\n\nSo, 34 = 253 * (1/7.441), and 1 = 253 * (1/253). So, the scaling factors are 1/7.441 and 1/253.\n\nBut 2024 is 8 * 253, so maybe the number of circles is 8 for radius 34 and 2024 for radius 1, which is 8 * 253.\n\nSo, the scaling factor is 253, so the inradius is 253.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is 253, so m=253, n=1, so m + n=254.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the inradius is 253, then the circles tangent to two sides would have radii that are fractions of 253.\n\nBut in the problem, the circles have radii 34 and 1, which are much smaller. So, maybe the inradius is 253, and the circles are scaled down by a factor.\n\nWait, but 34 is 253 divided by approximately 7.441, which is not an integer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inradius is 253, and the number of circles is proportional to the inradius.\n\nWait, 2024 is 8 * 253, so if 8 circles correspond to 253, then 2024 circles correspond to 253 * 253? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the number of circles is proportional to the inradius. So, if 8 circles correspond to radius 34, then 2024 circles correspond to radius 1, so 2024 / 8 = 253, so the inradius is 253.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the inradius is 253, so m=253, n=1, so m + n=254.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inradius is the harmonic mean or something else of the radii of the circles.\n\nWait, if the circles are tangent to two sides, their radii are related to the inradius by the formula r_i = r / (1 + sin(theta/2)), where theta is the angle at the vertex.\n\nBut since we have multiple circles, each subsequent circle would have a radius scaled by a factor.\n\nSo, if the first circle has radius r1, the next one r2 = r1 * k, and so on, with k being some constant less than 1.\n\nGiven that, the radii would be r1, r1*k, r1*k^2, ..., r1*k^{n-1}.\n\nThe sum of these", "answer": "197"}

Najděte největší reálné číslo, které je menší než $BD^2$ pro všechny takové kosočtverce.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest real number that is less than BD² for all possible kites ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the kite intersect at the origin. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a kite has two diagonals, and in this case, they intersect at the origin. Since it's a kite, one diagonal is the axis of symmetry, and the other is perpendicular to it. But wait, in a kite, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus. Hmm, no, actually, in a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, maybe the diagonals are the transverse and conjugate axes? But no, the hyperbola's transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate is along the y-axis. But in a kite, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the axes unless the kite is symmetric in that way.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so maybe the diagonals of the kite are along the coordinate axes? Let me think. If the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the kite is on the hyperbola, then the vertices of the kite must lie on the hyperbola. So, if the diagonals are along the x-axis and y-axis, then the kite would have vertices at (a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), and (0, -b). But wait, plugging into the hyperbola equation, for points on the x-axis, y=0, so x²/20 = 1, so x=±√20. Similarly, for points on the y-axis, x=0, so -y²/24 =1, which would mean y² = -24, which is impossible. So, the points on the y-axis can't be on the hyperbola. Therefore, the diagonals can't be along the coordinate axes because the kite can't have vertices on the y-axis.\n\nSo, maybe the diagonals are not along the coordinate axes. Hmm, that complicates things. So, the kite has two diagonals intersecting at the origin, but they are not necessarily the coordinate axes. So, the four vertices of the kite are points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\nLet me recall that in a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So, in this case, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must satisfy AB=AD and BC=CD, or something like that. But since it's a kite, the sides are equal in pairs, but not necessarily all equal, so it's not a rhombus.\n\nBut since the diagonals intersect at the origin, maybe the origin is the midpoint of one of the diagonals? Wait, in a kite, one of the diagonals is bisected by the other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of one of the diagonals. Let me think: in a kite, the axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal, and it is bisected by the other diagonal. So, if the kite is symmetric about one diagonal, then that diagonal is bisected by the other.\n\nSo, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then one diagonal is bisected by the other at the origin. So, suppose that diagonal AC is bisected by diagonal BD at the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nBut wait, in a kite, only one diagonal is bisected. So, if AC is the axis of symmetry, then BD is the other diagonal, which is not necessarily bisected. So, if A and C are symmetric about the origin, then BD is the other diagonal, which is not necessarily bisected. So, points B and D are not necessarily symmetric about the origin. Hmm, but in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of AC, but not necessarily of BD.\n\nWait, but in a kite, the axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal, and it is bisected by the other diagonal. So, if AC is the axis of symmetry, then BD is the other diagonal, which is not bisected. So, points B and D are not symmetric about the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and B is (p, q), D is (r, s), but since BD is not bisected, the origin is not the midpoint of BD. So, the midpoint of BD is ((p + r)/2, (q + s)/2), which is not (0,0). So, that complicates things.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have the equations:\n\nFor A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1\n\nFor B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1\n\nFor C: (-x)²/20 - (-y)²/24 = x²/20 - y²/24 =1, which is the same as A.\n\nSimilarly for D: r²/20 - s²/24 =1.\n\nSo, all four points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a kite, the sides AB = AD and CB = CD, or something like that. Wait, in a kite, two distinct pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So, either AB = AD and BC = CD, or AB = BC and AD = CD, etc. But in this case, since the kite is symmetric about AC, which is the axis of symmetry, so the sides adjacent to AC should be equal.\n\nSo, if AC is the axis of symmetry, then AB = AD and CB = CD.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote the points as follows:\n\nA: (x, y)\n\nC: (-x, -y)\n\nB: (p, q)\n\nD: (r, s)\n\nSince ABCD is a kite with AC as the axis of symmetry, then AB = AD and CB = CD.\n\nSo, the distance from A to B equals the distance from A to D.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from C to B equals the distance from C to D.\n\nSo, let's write these distance equations.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(x - p)² + (y - q)²]\n\nDistance AD: sqrt[(x - r)² + (y - s)²]\n\nSo, AB = AD implies:\n\n(x - p)² + (y - q)² = (x - r)² + (y - s)²\n\nSimilarly, distance CB: sqrt[(-x - p)² + (-y - q)²]\n\nDistance CD: sqrt[(-x - r)² + (-y - s)²]\n\nSo, CB = CD implies:\n\n(-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (-x - r)² + (-y - s)²\n\nSimplify these equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(x - p)² + (y - q)² = (x - r)² + (y - s)²\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nx² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q² = x² - 2xr + r² + y² - 2ys + s²\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2xp + p² - 2yq + q² = -2xr + r² - 2ys + s²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2xp + p² - 2yq + q² + 2xr - r² + 2ys - s² = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n2x(r - p) + 2y(s - q) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\n(-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (-x - r)² + (-y - s)²\n\nExpanding:\n\nx² + 2xp + p² + y² + 2yq + q² = x² + 2xr + r² + y² + 2ys + s²\n\nSimplify:\n\n2xp + p² + 2yq + q² = 2xr + r² + 2ys + s²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2xp + p² + 2yq + q² - 2xr - r² - 2ys - s² = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n2x(p - r) + 2y(q - s) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x(r - p) + 2y(s - q) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\n2) 2x(p - r) + 2y(q - s) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n2x(r - p) + 2y(s - q) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\nEquation 2:\n\n2x(p - r) + 2y(q - s) + (p² + q² - r² - s²) = 0\n\nNotice that equation 2 is just equation 1 multiplied by -1. So, equation 2 is -1*(equation 1). Therefore, these two equations are dependent, so they don't give us new information. So, we have only one independent equation from the kite condition.\n\nHmm, that's a bit of a problem. Maybe I need another condition.\n\nSince ABCD is a kite, the sides AB and AD are equal, and sides CB and CD are equal. Additionally, in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no, in a kite, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus. Wait, actually, in a kite, one of the diagonals is the perpendicular bisector of the other. So, in this case, since AC is the axis of symmetry, BD is the other diagonal, which is bisected by AC, but not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, no, in a kite, the axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal, and it is bisected by the other diagonal. So, in this case, AC is the axis of symmetry, so BD is the other diagonal, which is bisected by AC. So, the midpoint of BD lies on AC.\n\nBut since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of AC, but not necessarily of BD. So, the midpoint of BD is some point on AC, but not necessarily the origin.\n\nWait, but if the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of AC, then the midpoint of BD must lie on AC as well, because in a kite, the axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal, which is bisected by the other diagonal. So, the midpoint of BD lies on AC.\n\nSo, let me denote the midpoint of BD as M. Then, M lies on AC. Since AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so AC is the line through the origin with direction vector (x, y). So, any point on AC can be written as t(x, y) for some scalar t.\n\nBut the midpoint of BD is ((p + r)/2, (q + s)/2). So, this point must lie on AC, which is the line through the origin in the direction of (x, y). Therefore, ((p + r)/2, (q + s)/2) = t(x, y) for some t.\n\nSo, p + r = 2tx\n\nq + s = 2ty\n\nSo, that's another condition.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a kite, the sides AB and AD are equal, and CB and CD are equal. So, we have the distance conditions as before, but we also have the midpoint condition.\n\nSo, let me summarize the conditions:\n\n1. A: (x, y) on hyperbola: x²/20 - y²/24 =1\n\n2. C: (-x, -y) on hyperbola: same as A.\n\n3. B: (p, q) on hyperbola: p²/20 - q²/24 =1\n\n4. D: (r, s) on hyperbola: r²/20 - s²/24 =1\n\n5. Midpoint of BD: ((p + r)/2, (q + s)/2) = t(x, y)\n\n6. AB = AD: (x - p)² + (y - q)² = (x - r)² + (y - s)²\n\n7. CB = CD: (-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (-x - r)² + (-y - s)²\n\nBut as we saw earlier, conditions 6 and 7 are dependent, so they give only one equation.\n\nSo, let's try to use these conditions.\n\nFrom condition 5, we have:\n\np + r = 2tx\n\nq + s = 2ty\n\nSo, r = 2tx - p\n\ns = 2ty - q\n\nSo, we can express r and s in terms of p, q, t, x, y.\n\nNow, let's substitute r and s into condition 6.\n\nCondition 6: (x - p)² + (y - q)² = (x - r)² + (y - s)²\n\nSubstitute r = 2tx - p and s = 2ty - q:\n\nLeft side: (x - p)² + (y - q)²\n\nRight side: (x - (2tx - p))² + (y - (2ty - q))²\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n(x - 2tx + p)² + (y - 2ty + q)²\n\n= (x(1 - 2t) + p)² + (y(1 - 2t) + q)²\n\nSo, expanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - p)² + (y - q)² = x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q²\n\nRight side: [x(1 - 2t) + p]² + [y(1 - 2t) + q]²\n\n= [x²(1 - 2t)² + 2x(1 - 2t)p + p²] + [y²(1 - 2t)² + 2y(1 - 2t)q + q²]\n\n= x²(1 - 2t)² + 2x(1 - ", "answer": "480"}

The problem says:\n\n\"Nechť △ABC má obvodový střed O a vnitřní střed I s IA ⊥ OI, obvodový poloměr 13 a vnitřní poloměr 6. Najděte AB·AC.\"\n\nAlright, translating that, it means: Let triangle ABC have an circumcenter O and an incenter I such that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13 and the inradius is 6. Find AB multiplied by AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we need to find the product of two sides of the triangle, AB and AC, given some information about the circumradius (R), inradius (r), and a perpendicularity condition between IA and OI.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key condition. Maybe I can use some vector relationships or coordinate geometry here, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the relationships between these centers.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI² = R(R - 2r)\n\nLet me verify that. Yes, that's Euler's formula. So, plugging in the given values, R = 13 and r = 6, so:\n\nOI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13). That's the distance between the incenter and circumradius.\n\nNow, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is a segment from the incenter to vertex A, and it's perpendicular to OI. Maybe I can use some coordinate system here to model this.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system where O is at the origin (0,0). Then, since OI is a vector from O to I, and IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can place I somewhere along a coordinate axis to simplify things.\n\nLet me assume that OI lies along the x-axis for simplicity. So, point O is at (0,0), and point I is at (d, 0), where d is the distance OI, which we found to be sqrt(13). So, I is at (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis. So, IA must be vertical, along the y-axis. Therefore, point A must lie somewhere along the line x = sqrt(13), but since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA is vertical. So, the coordinates of A would be (sqrt(13), y) for some y.\n\nWait, but point A is a vertex of the triangle, so it's not necessarily on the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place point I at (0,0) instead, but then O would be somewhere else. Maybe that complicates things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vector methods. Let me denote vectors from O to I as vector OI, and from I to A as vector IA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, if I can express vectors OI and IA in coordinates, their dot product should be zero.\n\nBut maybe it's better to use coordinate geometry with O at (0,0) and I at (sqrt(13), 0). Then, point A is somewhere in the plane, and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nSo, vector OI is (sqrt(13), 0), and vector IA is (x - sqrt(13), y - 0) = (x - sqrt(13), y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero:\n\n(sqrt(13))(x - sqrt(13)) + 0*(y) = 0\n\nSo, sqrt(13)(x - sqrt(13)) = 0\n\nWhich implies x - sqrt(13) = 0, so x = sqrt(13). Therefore, point A must lie at (sqrt(13), y) for some y.\n\nSo, point A is at (sqrt(13), y). Now, since O is the circumradius center, OA = R = 13. So, the distance from O(0,0) to A(sqrt(13), y) is 13.\n\nSo, sqrt[(sqrt(13) - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 13\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(13 + y²) = 13\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n13 + y² = 169\n\nSo, y² = 169 - 13 = 156\n\nTherefore, y = sqrt(156) or y = -sqrt(156). Since the triangle is in a plane, it can be either above or below, but the product AB·AC will be the same regardless of the sign, so let's take y = sqrt(156).\n\nSo, point A is at (sqrt(13), sqrt(156)).\n\nNow, we need to find points B and C such that I is the incenter. The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors, and it's located at (sqrt(13), 0) in our coordinate system.\n\nWait, hold on. If I is the incenter, then it's located at (sqrt(13), 0), and O is at (0,0). So, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side of the triangle.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, I is at (sqrt(13), 0), so the distance from I to the x-axis is zero, but the inradius is 6. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I messed up the coordinate system.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't have placed O at (0,0) and I at (sqrt(13), 0). Because in reality, the inradius is the distance from I to the sides, not necessarily the distance along the x-axis.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my coordinate system. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use barycentric coordinates or some other method, but maybe it's getting too complicated.\n\nWait, another approach: in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). We have that already, OI = sqrt(13). Also, we have that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Maybe I can use that.\n\nThe formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is:\n\nIA = sqrt(R(R - 2r))\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's actually the formula for OI, which we already used. IA is different.\n\nWait, maybe I can use trigonometric relationships. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify.\n\nYes, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from the circumradius to vertex A is just R, which is given as 13.\n\nSo, IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nBut we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, how can we relate that?\n\nWait, maybe we can consider the vector from O to I and the vector from I to A. Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nBut in terms of vectors, OI is a vector from O to I, and IA is a vector from I to A. So, if we can express these vectors in terms of coordinates, their dot product is zero.\n\nBut earlier, I tried setting O at (0,0) and I at (sqrt(13), 0), but that led to a problem with the inradius. Maybe I need a different coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities and properties of triangle centers.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)) = sqrt(13(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13), as we found earlier.\n\nAlso, the distance IA is given by IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nBut we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, maybe we can relate the angle between IA and OI.\n\nWait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in terms of vectors, the dot product is zero.\n\nBut perhaps in terms of triangle geometry, we can relate this to some trigonometric function.\n\nWait, maybe we can consider triangle OIA. In triangle OIA, we have sides OI = sqrt(13), IA = 6 / sin(A/2), and OA = R = 13.\n\nMoreover, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees because IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right triangle at I.\n\nTherefore, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nOI² + IA² = OA²\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, in triangle OIA, if angle at I is 90 degrees, then yes, OI² + IA² = OA².\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n(sqrt(13))² + (IA)² = 13²\n\n13 + (IA)² = 169\n\nTherefore, (IA)² = 169 - 13 = 156\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)\n\nBut earlier, we had IA = 6 / sin(A/2). So,\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156)\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13\n\nYes, so sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13\n\nTherefore, A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13)\n\nSo, A = 2*arcsin(sqrt(39)/13)\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe we can find cos A using the double-angle formula.\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7/13\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13\n\nTherefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (49/169)) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, by the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A\n\nBut we need AB·AC, which is bc. So, if we can find bc, that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the area of the triangle in two different ways.\n\nThe area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps more useful here is the formula involving the inradius:\n\nArea = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nSo, let me write down these two expressions for the area.\n\nFirst, Area = r * s = 6s\n\nSecond, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52\n\nAlso, by the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nSo, a² = b² + c² - (14/13) bc\n\nBut we need to relate this to something else.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex.\n\nWait, we already used IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156). So, that gave us sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, which we used to find cos A = 7/13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the length of the sides in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter.\n\nWait, in a triangle, the lengths of the sides can be expressed as:\n\na = 2R sin A\n\nWait, no, that's the formula for the side opposite angle A in a triangle with circumradius R.\n\nYes, in any triangle, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, since R = 13, we have:\n\na = 26 sin A\n\nb = 26 sin B\n\nc = 26 sin C\n\nWe already found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13, so a = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, a = 4*sqrt(30)\n\nNow, we need to find b and c such that the inradius r = 6.\n\nWe know that the inradius is given by r = Area / s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nSo, let's compute the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2\n\nWe have a = 4*sqrt(30), and b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, in any triangle, A + B + C =", "answer": "468"}

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that a, b, and c are non-negative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is linear, and the second one is a combination of quadratic terms. Maybe I can find a way to relate these two equations or simplify the second one somehow.\n\nLooking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a symmetric form. Let me see:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b can be rewritten as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems a bit better. Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), right? Similarly, (a + c) would be (300 - b) and (a + b) would be (300 - c). So substituting these in, the expression becomes:\n\na²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).\n\nSo now, the second equation is:\n\na²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that might be easier to handle. Let me write that down:\n\n300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.\n\nI can factor out the 300:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nI wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca. I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, since a + b + c = 300, then:\n\n300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)\nSo, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Then, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nI can substitute a² + b² + c² with 90,000 - 2Q:\n\n300(90,000 - 2Q) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nCalculating 300 * 90,000: that's 27,000,000. Then, 300 * (-2Q) is -600Q. So:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n- (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 600Q\n- (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000 + 600Q\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nNow, I need to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.\n\nSubstituting S = 300:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.\n\nCalculating 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000. So:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.\n\nBut earlier, we had:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P = 21,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P - 21,000,000 + 600Q = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n6,000,000 - 300Q + 3P = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n2,000,000 - 100Q + P = 0\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so we have P = abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut Q is ab + bc + ca, so P is expressed in terms of Q. Maybe I can find a relationship between Q and P.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me think about possible values of a, b, c.\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative integers adding up to 300, each of them can range from 0 to 300. But the expression a³ + b³ + c³ is quite large, so maybe the variables can't be too large.\n\nWait, 6,000,000 is the value of the second expression. Let me see, if all a, b, c are equal, say a = b = c = 100, then let's compute the second expression:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.\n\nEach term would be 100²*100 = 1,000,000. There are six such terms, so 6,000,000. Oh! So when a = b = c = 100, the second equation is satisfied.\n\nSo, (100, 100, 100) is one solution. But are there others?\n\nWait, let me check. If a, b, c are all 100, then the first equation is satisfied: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. The second equation is also satisfied as we saw.\n\nBut are there other triples where a, b, c are not all equal that satisfy both equations?\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose a = 0, then b + c = 300. Let's see what the second equation becomes.\n\nIf a = 0, then the second equation becomes:\n\n0²b + 0²c + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + 0 + c²b = b²c + bc² = bc(b + c).\n\nSince b + c = 300, this becomes bc*300. So, 300bc = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, bc = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo, if a = 0, then b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. So, we can solve for b and c.\n\nLet me set up the quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nDiscriminant D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSquare root of D is 100. So, solutions are (300 ± 100)/2, which are 200 and 100.\n\nSo, b = 200, c = 100 or b = 100, c = 200.\n\nTherefore, when a = 0, we have two solutions: (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). Similarly, if b = 0, we can have two solutions: (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200). And if c = 0, we can have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).\n\nSo, in total, for the case where one variable is zero, we have 6 solutions.\n\nWait, but hold on. When a = 0, we have two solutions. Similarly, when b = 0, two solutions, and when c = 0, two solutions. So, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 solutions where one of the variables is zero.\n\nBut are there other solutions where none of the variables are zero?\n\nWe already have the solution where all variables are 100. Are there others?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c = 300 - 2a. Let's see if this can satisfy the second equation.\n\nSo, let me set a = b, c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, the second equation becomes:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a.\n\nFactor out 2a:\n\n2a(a² + a c + c²).\n\nBut c = 300 - 2a, so substitute:\n\n2a(a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)²).\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the parentheses:\n\na² + 300a - 2a² + (90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a²\n\n300a - 1,200a = -900a\n\nAnd the constant term is 90,000.\n\nSo, altogether, 3a² - 900a + 90,000.\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n2a(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6a³ - 1,800a² + 180,000a.\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a³ - 1,800a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\na³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., ±1,000,000. But since a is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 150 (since c = 300 - 2a must be non-negative), let's test a = 100.\n\na = 100:\n\n100³ - 300*100² + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nSo, a = 100 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic", "answer": "601"}

The set F consists of all segments PQ of length 1, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. \n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. We have point O at the origin (0,0), point A at (1/2, 0), and point B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a line segment connecting these two points. The set F is all the segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. These segments are in the first quadrant, so both P and Q have positive coordinates.\n\nI need to find a point C on AB, not equal to A or B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then, compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nLet me start by parametrizing the line segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be written as:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - t)\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at point A, and when t=1, we are at point B. So, any point C on AB can be represented as ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out the conditions under which point C lies on another segment PQ from the set F. Since each PQ is a segment of length 1 with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, let's denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q). The distance between P and Q is 1, so by the distance formula:\n\nsqrt((p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2) = 1\n=> p² + q² = 1\n\nSo, for each PQ in F, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1, with p > 0 and q > 0.\n\nNow, if point C lies on PQ, then it must satisfy the equation of the line PQ. The line PQ can be parametrized as well. Let me find the equation of line PQ. Since it connects (p, 0) to (0, q), the slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation of PQ is:\n\ny = (-q/p)x + q\n\nAlternatively, in intercept form, it's x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, for point C = (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nBut since C is on AB, we can substitute x and y from the parametric equations of AB into this equation. So, substituting x = (1/2)(1 - t) and y = (sqrt(3)/2)t into x/p + y/q = 1:\n\n[(1/2)(1 - t)]/p + [(sqrt(3)/2)t]/q = 1\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2q) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2\n\nBut we also know that p² + q² = 1 because PQ is of length 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2\n2. p² + q² = 1\n\nOur goal is to find t such that this system has a solution (p, q) other than the trivial one corresponding to AB itself. Since AB is part of F, we need to find a t where this system has a solution (p, q) different from the one corresponding to AB.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a segment PQ where P is (1/2, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if p² + q² = 1 for these values:\n\np = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo, p² + q² = (1/2)² + (sqrt(3)/2)² = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Yes, that's correct. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nNow, we need to find another t where the system has a solution (p, q) different from (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, we need to solve the system:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2\np² + q² = 1\n\nLet me denote s = t for simplicity. So, we have:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\np² + q² = 1\n\nWe can try to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the first equation for one variable. Let's solve for q in terms of p.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n(sqrt(3) s)/q = 2 - (1 - s)/p\n\nMultiply both sides by q:\n\nsqrt(3) s = [2 - (1 - s)/p] q\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, let's express q from the first equation.\n\nLet me write the first equation as:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nA/p + B/q = 2, where A = (1 - s) and B = sqrt(3) s\n\nSo, A/p + B/q = 2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(A q + B p) / (p q) = 2\n\nSo,\n\nA q + B p = 2 p q\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1 - s) q + sqrt(3) s p = 2 p q\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nsqrt(3) s p - 2 p q + (1 - s) q = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\np (sqrt(3) s - 2 q) + q (1 - s) = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider that p² + q² = 1, so we can parameterize p and q using trigonometric functions. Let me set p = cos θ and q = sin θ, where θ is in the first quadrant (0 < θ < π/2). Then, p² + q² = 1 is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo, substituting p = cos θ and q = sin θ into the first equation:\n\n(1 - s)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) s)/sin θ = 2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - s) sec θ + sqrt(3) s csc θ = 2\n\nHmm, this might be a way to express θ in terms of s, but it's still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each s, we can solve for θ such that the above equation holds. But since we need to find s such that there exists θ ≠ the one corresponding to AB, which is when s = 0 (since AB is when P = (1/2, 0) and Q = (0, sqrt(3)/2), which corresponds to s=0 because when s=0, point C is A, but wait, actually, when s=0, point C is A, but in our parametrization, s is t, which goes from 0 to 1 as we move from A to B. So, when s=0, C is A, and when s=1, C is B.\n\nWait, but in the parametrization, when s=0, x = 1/2, y=0, which is point A, and when s=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So, the point C is somewhere in between, with s between 0 and 1.\n\nBut we need to find s such that there exists θ (other than the one corresponding to AB) where the equation holds.\n\nWait, but AB itself is a segment in F, so for s=0, we have p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, which is the case when C is A. Similarly, for s=1, C is B, which is also in F.\n\nBut the problem states that C is a point on AB different from A and B, so s is between 0 and 1, not including 0 and 1. So, we need to find s in (0,1) such that there exists another θ (different from the one corresponding to AB) where the equation holds.\n\nSo, let's write the equation again:\n\n(1 - s)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) s)/sin θ = 2\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\n(1 - s) sec θ + sqrt(3) s csc θ = 2\n\nI can write this as:\n\n(1 - s)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) s)/sin θ = 2\n\nLet me multiply both sides by sin θ cos θ to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ = 2 sin θ cos θ\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ = sin(2θ)\n\nBecause 2 sin θ cos θ = sin(2θ)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ = sin(2θ)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ - sin(2θ) = 0\n\nNow, sin(2θ) is 2 sin θ cos θ, so:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ - 2 sin θ cos θ = 0\n\nLet me factor sin θ and cos θ:\n\nsin θ (1 - s - 2 cos θ) + sqrt(3) s cos θ = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider that for each s, the equation is:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ = sin(2θ)\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ - 2 sin θ cos θ = 0\n\nLet me group terms with sin θ and cos θ:\n\nsin θ (1 - s - 2 cos θ) + sqrt(3) s cos θ = 0\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that this is a linear equation in sin θ and cos θ. Maybe I can write it in the form A sin θ + B cos θ = C.\n\nLet me see:\n\n(1 - s) sin θ + sqrt(3) s cos θ = 2 sin θ cos θ\n\nLet me denote the left side as A sin θ + B cos θ, where A = (1 - s) and B = sqrt(3) s.\n\nSo, A sin θ + B cos θ = 2 sin θ cos θ\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nA sin θ + B cos θ - 2 sin θ cos θ = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sin θ:\n\nsin θ (A - 2 cos θ) + B cos θ = 0\n\nBut I don't see an immediate way to solve this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe square both sides? But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since p and q are related by p² + q² = 1, and we have another equation involving p and q, perhaps we can solve for p and q in terms of s.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - s) q + sqrt(3) s p = 2 p q\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - s) q + sqrt(3) s p = 2 p q\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2 p q - sqrt(3) s p - (1 - s) q = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\np (2 q - sqrt(3) s) - q (1 - s) = 0\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me express q in terms of p.\n\nFrom p² + q² = 1, q = sqrt(1 - p²). But that might complicate things because of the square root.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each s, we can write the equation as:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\n\nAnd p² + q² = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations with two variables p and q. Let me try to solve this system.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3) s)/q = 2\n\nEquation 2 is:\n\np² + q² = 1\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for 1/p:\n\n1/p = [2 - (sqrt(3) s)/q] / (1 - s)\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, let me express 1/p from equation 1:\n\n1/p = [2 - (sqrt(3) s)/q] / (1 - s)\n\nThen, p = (1 - s)/[2 - (sqrt(3) s)/q]\n\nBut p is also sqrt(1 - q²). So,\n\nsqrt(1 - q²) = (1 - s)/[2 - (sqrt(3) s)/q]\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can square both sides:\n\n1 - q² = (1 - s)² / [2 - (sqrt(3) s)/q]^2\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing AB, I can think geometrically. The set F consists of all segments of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment of length 1, so the set F is a family of lines tangent to the unit circle in the first quadrant.\n\nWait, is", "answer": "23"}

Here, \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\). That might come in handy later.\n\nThe product given is from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 12\\), so that's 13 terms. Each term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let me see if I can simplify each term or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write each term as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\(\\omega^k\\). Maybe I can factor it or express it differently.\n\nLet me set \\(x = \\omega^k\\). Then each term becomes \\(2 - 2x + x^2\\). So, the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). Wait, but \\(x\\) here is each of the 13th roots of unity, right? Because \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(12\\) gives all the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, the product is essentially the product of \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) evaluated at each 13th root of unity. That is, \\(\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Hmm, I remember that for polynomials, the product over all roots can be related to the polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, more specifically, if I have a polynomial \\(P(x)\\), then the product \\(\\prod_{x^{n}=1} P(x)\\) can sometimes be expressed in terms of another polynomial evaluated at specific points. Let me recall that.\n\nI think that if \\(P(x)\\) is a polynomial, then \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} P(\\omega^k)\\) is equal to the resultant of \\(P(x)\\) and \\(x^n - 1\\), but I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as evaluating another polynomial at the roots of unity.\n\nWait, another approach: if I have a polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) and I know all its roots, then the product over all roots of \\(Q(x)\\) is related to the constant term. But in this case, I have a product over \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) evaluated at each 13th root of unity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial whose roots are \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) for each root \\(x\\) of \\(x^{13} - 1\\). Hmm, that might be complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating the product \\(\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me denote \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Then, the product is \\(\\prod_{x^{13}=1} f(x)\\).\n\nI remember that for a polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the product \\(\\prod_{x^{n}=1} f(x)\\) can be expressed as the resultant of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(x^n - 1\\), but I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms or something, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nWait, another idea: since \\(x^{13} = 1\\), then \\(x \\neq 0\\), so maybe I can write the product as \\(\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = \\prod_{x^{13}=1} \\frac{x^3 + 1}{x + 1}\\), but wait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nWait, \\(x^3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)\\), so that's not the same as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\), since the roots are complex numbers. So, \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\). Therefore, the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k)(1 - i - \\omega^k)\\).\n\nSo, that's \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) \\times \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k)\\). Hmm, so that's the product over all 13th roots of unity of \\((1 + i - \\omega^k)\\) times the same for \\(1 - i\\).\n\nI remember that for a root of unity \\(\\omega\\), the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \\omega^k) = x^n - 1\\). So, in this case, for each term, the product over \\(k=0\\) to \\(12\\) of \\((a - \\omega^k)\\) is \\(a^{13} - 1\\). So, applying that here, we have:\n\n\\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1\\)\n\nand\n\n\\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1\\)\n\nTherefore, the original product is \\([(1 + i)^{13} - 1] \\times [(1 - i)^{13} - 1]\\).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\), subtract 1 from each, and then multiply the results together.\n\nLet me compute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\). First, I can write \\(1 + i\\) in polar form. The modulus is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\), and the argument is \\(\\pi/4\\). So, \\(1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i\\pi/4}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((1 + i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} \\cdot e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4}\\).\n\nCompute \\((\\sqrt{2})^{13}\\): that's \\(2^{13/2} = 2^{6} \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 64 \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNow, the exponent in the exponential: \\(13 \\cdot \\pi/4\\). Let's compute that modulo \\(2\\pi\\) to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4 = (3π + π/4). But 3π is equivalent to π modulo 2π, so 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute 13 * π/4:\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (which is 12π/4) plus 1π/4. So, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is equal to π modulo 2π, so 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4. So, yes, the angle is 5π/4.\n\nTherefore, \\(e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = \\cos(5\\pi/4) + i \\sin(5\\pi/4) = -\\sqrt{2}/2 - i\\sqrt{2}/2\\).\n\nSo, putting it together, \\((1 + i)^{13} = 64 \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (-\\sqrt{2}/2 - i\\sqrt{2}/2)\\).\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \\times (-2/2) = 64 \\times (-1) = -64\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-i\\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \\times (-i \\times 2/2) = 64 \\times (-i) = -64i\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\\).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute \\((1 - i)^{13}\\). Again, write \\(1 - i\\) in polar form. The modulus is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\), and the argument is \\(-\\pi/4\\) or \\(7\\pi/4\\).\n\nSo, \\(1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{-i\\pi/4}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((1 - i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} \\cdot e^{-i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4}\\).\n\nAgain, \\((\\sqrt{2})^{13} = 64 \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nCompute the exponent: \\(-13 \\cdot \\pi/4\\). Let's find the equivalent angle modulo \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n-13π/4 is the same as (-13π/4 + 4π) = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. Alternatively, adding 2π until it's within 0 to 2π.\n\nWait, let me compute -13π/4 + 2π * 2 = -13π/4 + 8π/4 = (-13 + 8)π/4 = -5π/4. Hmm, still negative. Add another 2π: -5π/4 + 8π/4 = 3π/4. So, the angle is 3π/4.\n\nTherefore, \\(e^{-i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = e^{i \\cdot 3\\pi/4} = \\cos(3\\pi/4) + i \\sin(3\\pi/4) = -\\sqrt{2}/2 + i\\sqrt{2}/2\\).\n\nSo, \\((1 - i)^{13} = 64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{2}/2 + i\\sqrt{2}/2)\\).\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \\times (-2/2) = -64\\).\n\nSecond, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (i\\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \\times (i \\times 2/2) = 64i\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\\).\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n\\((1 + i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i\\)\n\nand\n\n\\((1 - i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i\\).\n\nTherefore, the original product is:\n\n\\((-65 - 64i) \\times (-65 + 64i)\\).\n\nLet me compute that. It's of the form \\((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2\\), where \\(a = -65\\) and \\(b = 64i\\). Wait, no, actually, it's \\((c + di)(c - di) = c^2 + d^2\\). So, in this case, \\(c = -65\\) and \\(d = 64\\).\n\nSo, the product is \\((-65)^2 + (64)^2\\).\n\nCompute that:\n\n\\((-65)^2 = 4225\\)\n\n\\(64^2 = 4096\\)\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, computing \\((1 + i)^{13}\\):\n\n- Modulus: \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so raised to 13 is \\(2^{13/2} = 64 \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- Angle: 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to 5π/4.\n\n- So, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (\\cos 5π/4 + i \\sin 5π/4)\\) is indeed \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{2}/2 - i\\sqrt{2}/2)\\), which simplifies to -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \\((1 - i)^{13}\\):\n\n- Modulus same, angle is -13π/4, which is equivalent to 3π/4.\n\n- So, \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (\\cos 3π/4 + i \\sin 3π/4)\\) is \\(64 \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{2}/2 + i\\sqrt{", "answer": "321"}

First, let's understand what it means for a number to be \\( b \\)-eautiful. If \\( n \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\), it can be expressed as \\( n = a \\times b + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are the digits in base \\( b \\).

Maybe I can factor or find a way to express this in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let's try that. From the original equation:\n\\[ a + c = \\sqrt{a \\times b + c} \\]\nLet me denote \\( s = a + c \\), so \\( s = \\sqrt{n} \\). Then, \\( n = s^2 \\). Also, \\( n = a \\times b + c \\), so:\n\\[ s^2 = a \\times b + c \\]\nBut since \\( s = a + c \\), we can write \\( c = s - a \\). Substituting this into the equation:\n\\[ s^2 = a \\times b + (s - a) \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ s^2 = a \\times b + s - a \\]\nBring all terms to one side:\n\\[ s^2 - s - a \\times b + a = 0 \\]\nFactor out \\( a \\):\n\\[ s^2 - s + a(1 - b) = 0 \\]\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can solve for \\( a \\) in terms of \\( s \\) and \\( b \\):\n\\[ a(1 - b) = -s^2 + s \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\]\nSince \\( a \\) must be an integer between 1 and \\( b - 1 \\), \\( \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\) must be an integer. So, \\( b - 1 \\) must divide \\( s^2 - s \\).\n\nAlso, \\( c = s - a \\) must be an integer between 0 and \\( b - 1 \\). So, \\( c = s - \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\) must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq c < b \\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\\[ c = s - \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ c = \\frac{(s)(b - 1) - (s^2 - s)}{b - 1} \\]\n\\[ c = \\frac{s(b - 1) - s^2 + s}{b - 1} \\]\n\\[ c = \\frac{s b - s - s^2 + s}{b - 1} \\]\n\\[ c = \\frac{s b - s^2}{b - 1} \\]\nFactor out \\( s \\):\n\\[ c = \\frac{s(b - s)}{b - 1} \\]\nSo, \\( c \\) must be an integer between 0 and \\( b - 1 \\).

So, \\( b \\leq s^2 \\leq b^2 - 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( s \\) must satisfy:\n\\[ \\sqrt{b} \\leq s \\leq \\sqrt{b^2 - 1} \\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[ \\sqrt{b} \\leq s \\leq b - 1 \\]\nBecause \\( \\sqrt{b^2 - 1} \\) is slightly less than \\( b \\), so the upper bound is \\( b - 1 \\).\n\nSo, for each base \\( b \\), we can iterate over possible \\( s \\) values from \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) to \\( b - 1 \\), and check if \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) as defined above are integers within their respective ranges.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest \\( b \\) such that there are more than ten such \\( s \\) (and hence more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers).\n\nLet me try to formalize this. For each \\( b \\), the number of \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers \\( s \\) in \\( [\\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil, b - 1] \\) such that both \\( a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\) and \\( c = \\frac{s(b - s)}{b - 1} \\) are integers within their respective ranges.\n\nSo, to find the minimal \\( b \\) with more than ten such \\( s \\), I need to compute for each \\( b \\) starting from 2 upwards, count the number of valid \\( s \\), and find the first \\( b \\) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems computational, but since I'm doing this manually, I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between \\( s \\) and \\( b \\). From the equation \\( a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\), since \\( a \\) must be an integer, \\( b - 1 \\) must divide \\( s^2 - s \\). Similarly, \\( c = \\frac{s(b - s)}{b - 1} \\) must also be an integer.\n\nSo, \\( b - 1 \\) divides both \\( s^2 - s \\) and \\( s(b - s) \\). Let me denote \\( d = b - 1 \\), so \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\) and \\( d \\) divides \\( s(b - s) \\).\n\nLet me write \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\) as \\( d | s(s - 1) \\), and \\( d | s(b - s) \\). Since \\( b = d + 1 \\), we can write \\( b - s = d + 1 - s \\). So, \\( d | s(d + 1 - s) \\).\n\nSo, \\( d \\) divides \\( s(d + 1 - s) \\). Let me expand this:\n\\[ s(d + 1 - s) = s d + s - s^2 \\]\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\), so \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) divides \\( s d + s - s^2 \\) because \\( d \\) divides each term \\( s d \\) and \\( s^2 - s \\). So, \\( d \\) divides \\( s \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, \\( d \\) divides \\( s \\). Therefore, \\( s = k d \\) for some integer \\( k \\). But \\( s \\) is between \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{b} \\rceil \\) and \\( b - 1 \\), and \\( d = b - 1 \\). So, \\( s = k (b - 1) \\). But since \\( s \\leq b - 1 \\), the only possible value for \\( k \\) is 1. Therefore, \\( s = b - 1 \\).\n\nWait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check my reasoning.\n\nI said that \\( d \\) divides \\( s(d + 1 - s) \\) and \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\). Then, \\( d \\) divides \\( s(d + 1 - s) - (s^2 - s) \\). Let's compute that:\n\\[ s(d + 1 - s) - (s^2 - s) = s d + s - s^2 - s^2 + s = s d + 2s - 2s^2 \\]\nHmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I made a wrong turn.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\), and \\( d \\) divides \\( s(b - s) \\), perhaps \\( d \\) divides the sum or difference of these two expressions.\n\nLet me compute \\( s^2 - s + s(b - s) \\):\n\\[ s^2 - s + s b - s^2 = s b - s = s(b - 1) = s d \\]\nSo, \\( d \\) divides \\( s d \\), which is trivially true. So, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( d \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\) and \\( d \\) divides \\( s(b - s) \\). So, \\( d \\) must divide any linear combination of these. Let me consider \\( s^2 - s - (b - s) \\times k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nBut maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me try plugging in some small values of \\( b \\) and see how it goes.\n\nStarting with \\( b = 2 \\):\n- \\( d = 1 \\)\n- \\( s \\) must be between \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\) and \\( 1 \\). So, \\( s = 2 \\) is not possible because \\( b - 1 = 1 \\). Wait, \\( s \\) must be at least \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), so \\( s = 2 \\) is the next integer. But \\( s \\) must be less than or equal to \\( b - 1 = 1 \\). So, no solutions. So, \\( b = 2 \\) has zero \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me check. For \\( b = 2 \\), two-digit numbers are from \\( 10_2 = 2 \\) to \\( 11_2 = 3 \\). So, \\( n \\) can be 2 or 3.\n\nCheck if 2 is \\( 2 \\)-eautiful: in base 2, 2 is \\( 10_2 \\). The digits are 1 and 0. Sum is 1 + 0 = 1. \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), which is not equal to 1. So, 2 is not \\( 2 \\)-eautiful.\n\nCheck 3: in base 2, 3 is \\( 11_2 \\). The digits are 1 and 1. Sum is 2. \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\), which is not equal to 2. So, 3 is not \\( 2 \\)-eautiful. So, indeed, \\( b = 2 \\) has zero \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers.\n\nNext, \\( b = 3 \\):\n- \\( d = 2 \\)\n- \\( s \\) must be between \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\) and \\( 2 \\). So, \\( s = 2 \\).\n- Check if \\( a = (2^2 - 2)/2 = (4 - 2)/2 = 1 \\). So, \\( a = 1 \\).\n- \\( c = (2(3 - 2))/2 = (2 * 1)/2 = 1 \\). So, \\( c = 1 \\).\n- So, \\( n = 1 * 3 + 1 = 4 \\). Check if \\( 1 + 1 = 2 = \\sqrt{4} \\). Yes, it works. So, \\( n = 4 \\) is \\( 3 \\)-eautiful.\n- Any other \\( s \\)? Next \\( s = 3 \\), but \\( s \\) must be less than \\( b - 1 = 2 \\). So, only \\( s = 2 \\). So, only one \\( b \\)-eautiful number.\n\nSo, \\( b = 3 \\) has one \\( b \\)-eautiful number.\n\nMoving on to \\( b = 4 \\):\n- \\( d = 3 \\)\n- \\( s \\) must be between \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\). So, \\( s = 2, 3 \\).\n- For \\( s = 2 \\):\n  - \\( a = (4 - 2)/3 = 2/3 \\). Not integer. So, invalid.\n- For \\( s = 3 \\):\n  - \\( a = (9 - 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2 \\). So, \\( a = 2 \\).\n  - \\( c = (3(4 - 3))/3 = (3 * 1)/3 = 1 \\). So, \\( c = 1 \\).\n  - \\( n = 2 * 4 + 1 = 9 \\). Check if \\( 2 + 1 = 3", "answer": "211"}

Each side of these rectangles must lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram provided shows three examples of such rectangles, but I need to figure out the total count.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the dodecagon. It's a regular polygon with 12 equal sides and angles. Each central angle is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the vertices are spaced 30 degrees apart around the center.\n\nNow, the rectangles can have their sides either on the sides of the dodecagon or on its diagonals. I need to figure out how many such rectangles can be formed.\n\nI remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. So, maybe I can approach this by considering pairs of vertices that are diametrically opposite or separated by certain numbers of steps.\n\nLet me think about how rectangles are formed. A rectangle requires four points such that each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees. In a regular polygon, this can happen if the sides are aligned in such a way that their connecting lines form right angles.\n\nBut since the dodecagon is regular, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles. The key is to find all sets of four points that form rectangles.\n\nI think a good approach is to consider the possible distances between vertices, which correspond to different diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, adjacent vertices are connected by sides, skipping 0 vertices. Skipping 1 vertex gives a shorter diagonal, skipping 2 gives a longer one, and so on.\n\nIn a dodecagon, the maximum number of vertices you can skip without overlapping is 5, because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction. So, the possible diagonals correspond to skipping 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.\n\nEach diagonal can be associated with a certain length and angle. For a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the adjacent sides must be perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps I can categorize the rectangles based on the lengths of their sides, which correspond to different diagonals.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. **Sides aligned with the polygon's sides:**\n   - If a rectangle has sides aligned with the sides of the dodecagon, then each side of the rectangle is a side of the dodecagon. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, all sides are equal, but the angles between sides are 150 degrees (since internal angle = (n-2)*180/n = 150 for n=12). So, if I try to form a rectangle with sides aligned to the sides, the angles between the sides would be 150 degrees, which is not 90 degrees. Therefore, such rectangles cannot exist. So, rectangles must have sides that are not aligned with the sides of the dodecagon but are instead aligned with diagonals.\n\n2. **Sides aligned with diagonals:**\n   - So, the sides of the rectangle must be diagonals of the dodecagon. Let's consider diagonals that skip k vertices, where k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n   For a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and adjacent sides must be perpendicular. So, if I can find two different diagonals (say, skipping k and m vertices) that are perpendicular to each other, then their intersection points can form a rectangle.\n\n   Therefore, the key is to find pairs of diagonals that are perpendicular and intersect at the center or somewhere inside the dodecagon.\n\n   Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, diagonals can be perpendicular if the number of skipped vertices satisfies certain conditions.\n\n   Let me recall that in a regular polygon, two diagonals are perpendicular if the number of vertices they skip adds up to n/2, where n is the number of sides. For a dodecagon, n=12, so n/2=6. Therefore, if one diagonal skips k vertices, the other should skip 6 - k vertices to be perpendicular.\n\n   So, for k=1, the perpendicular diagonal would skip 5 vertices. For k=2, the perpendicular diagonal skips 4 vertices, and for k=3, it skips 3 vertices. For k=4, it skips 2, and for k=5, it skips 1.\n\n   Therefore, the pairs of diagonals that are perpendicular are (1,5), (2,4), and (3,3). The (3,3) pair is interesting because both diagonals skip 3 vertices, which are actually diameters of the dodecagon.\n\n   So, now, for each pair of perpendicular diagonals, I can find rectangles by choosing two such diagonals and seeing where they intersect.\n\n   But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the intersection points of diagonals can form rectangles. Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of such diagonals.\n\n   Let me think about how many such rectangles can be formed.\n\n   For each pair of perpendicular diagonals, how many rectangles can they form? Well, each pair of perpendicular diagonals that intersect inside the polygon can form a rectangle. But I need to count how many such pairs exist.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting four points that form a rectangle.\n\n   Each rectangle is determined by two diameters (if they are both diameters) or by two perpendicular diagonals.\n\n   Wait, actually, in a regular dodecagon, a rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center, and the lines connecting them are perpendicular.\n\n   So, for each pair of perpendicular diameters, we can form a rectangle by choosing points on each diameter.\n\n   But in a dodecagon, diameters are diagonals that connect opposite vertices. There are 6 diameters in a dodecagon because each diameter connects two opposite vertices, and there are 12 vertices, so 12/2=6.\n\n   So, the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters is equal to the number of ways to choose two perpendicular diameters.\n\n   Since each diameter is separated by 30 degrees, two diameters are perpendicular if they are separated by 90 degrees, which is 3 steps around the polygon (since 30*3=90).\n\n   So, starting from any diameter, there are two other diameters that are perpendicular to it. For example, if I have a diameter connecting vertex 1 and vertex 7, then the diameters connecting vertex 4 and vertex 10, and vertex 2 and vertex 8 are perpendicular to it.\n\n   Wait, actually, each diameter has two perpendicular diameters. So, how many unique pairs of perpendicular diameters are there?\n\n   Since there are 6 diameters, each can pair with two others, but each pair is counted twice. So, the total number of unique perpendicular diameter pairs is (6*2)/2=6.\n\n   Therefore, there are 6 pairs of perpendicular diameters. Each such pair can form a rectangle by selecting points on each diameter.\n\n   But wait, actually, each pair of perpendicular diameters can form multiple rectangles, depending on how many points we choose on each diameter.\n\n   However, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that each side of the rectangle must lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned with the sides or diagonals.\n\n   Wait, but in the case of diameters, the sides of the rectangle would be along the diameters, which are diagonals. So, the sides of the rectangle are diagonals, which is allowed.\n\n   But in this case, the rectangle would have its sides along the diameters, which are diagonals, and its other sides would be along the other pair of perpendicular diameters.\n\n   So, each pair of perpendicular diameters can form a rectangle by connecting their endpoints.\n\n   But wait, each pair of perpendicular diameters actually forms a rectangle with four vertices: the endpoints of the two diameters. So, each such pair defines exactly one rectangle.\n\n   Therefore, since there are 6 pairs of perpendicular diameters, there are 6 such rectangles.\n\n   But wait, in the diagram provided, there are three rectangles shown. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles can also be formed using non-diameter diagonals.\n\n   Let me think again.\n\n   So, earlier, I considered that rectangles can be formed by pairs of perpendicular diagonals, not necessarily diameters. So, for example, a rectangle could be formed by two diagonals that skip 1 and 5 vertices, which are perpendicular.\n\n   Each such pair of diagonals would intersect at some point inside the polygon, and their intersection would form a rectangle.\n\n   So, how many such pairs are there?\n\n   For each k from 1 to 5, we can pair it with 6 - k to get perpendicular diagonals.\n\n   So, for k=1 and k=5, we have pairs that are perpendicular.\n\n   Similarly, for k=2 and k=4, and for k=3 and k=3.\n\n   So, let's consider each case.\n\n   **Case 1: Diagonals skipping 1 and 5 vertices.**\n\n   Each diagonal skipping 1 vertex is a short diagonal, and each skipping 5 vertices is a longer diagonal.\n\n   How many such pairs of perpendicular diagonals are there?\n\n   For each vertex, there is a diagonal skipping 1 vertex going outwards, and another diagonal skipping 5 vertices going inwards (since skipping 5 is equivalent to skipping -1 in the other direction).\n\n   But to form a rectangle, we need two such diagonals that are perpendicular.\n\n   Since the polygon is regular, the number of such pairs can be calculated.\n\n   For each vertex, there are two diagonals: one skipping 1 and one skipping 5. But these diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular.\n\n   Wait, actually, earlier, we saw that diagonals skipping k and 6 - k are perpendicular. So, for k=1, 6 -1=5, so diagonals skipping 1 and 5 are perpendicular.\n\n   So, for each vertex, there is a diagonal skipping 1 vertex and another skipping 5 vertices, and these are perpendicular.\n\n   However, each such pair is counted twice because each rectangle is defined by two diagonals, each from a different vertex.\n\n   So, perhaps the number of such rectangles is equal to the number of such pairs.\n\n   Let me think differently.\n\n   Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of perpendicular diagonals.\n\n   So, for each pair of perpendicular diagonals (skipping 1 and 5), how many rectangles can they form?\n\n   Each such pair of diagonals will intersect at a point inside the polygon, and the four endpoints will form a rectangle.\n\n   So, for each such pair, we get one rectangle.\n\n   Now, how many such pairs are there?\n\n   Since there are 12 vertices, and each vertex is connected to two diagonals (skipping 1 and 5), but each diagonal is shared by two vertices.\n\n   So, the number of diagonals skipping 1 vertex is 12, but each is counted twice, so actually 6 unique diagonals.\n\n   Similarly, diagonals skipping 5 vertices are also 6 unique diagonals.\n\n   Each diagonal skipping 1 vertex is perpendicular to a diagonal skipping 5 vertices.\n\n   So, the number of such perpendicular pairs is 6 (since each of the 6 diagonals skipping 1 vertex is perpendicular to exactly one diagonal skipping 5 vertices).\n\n   Therefore, there are 6 such rectangles formed by diagonals skipping 1 and 5 vertices.\n\n   **Case 2: Diagonals skipping 2 and 4 vertices.**\n\n   Similarly, diagonals skipping 2 and 4 vertices are perpendicular.\n\n   Using the same logic, the number of such pairs is 6.\n\n   Each diagonal skipping 2 vertices is perpendicular to a diagonal skipping 4 vertices.\n\n   So, there are 6 such rectangles.\n\n   **Case 3: Diagonals skipping 3 vertices.**\n\n   Here, both diagonals skip 3 vertices, which are diameters.\n\n   As we discussed earlier, there are 6 diameters, and each pair of perpendicular diameters forms a rectangle.\n\n   But wait, in this case, the rectangle is formed by two diameters, which are both diagonals skipping 3 vertices.\n\n   However, each such pair of perpendicular diameters forms a rectangle with four vertices.\n\n   As calculated earlier, there are 6 such pairs, so 6 rectangles.\n\n   But wait, in the diagram, only three rectangles are shown. So, perhaps I'm overcounting.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the rectangles formed by the diameters are larger and only count once per pair.\n\n   Wait, but in the case of diameters, each pair of perpendicular diameters defines a unique rectangle, so 6 in total.\n\n   However, in the diagram, only three are shown, which might be because they are overlapping or something else.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the rectangles formed by the diameters are actually squares, and there are only three unique squares.\n\n   No, in a dodecagon, the diameters are at 30-degree intervals, so the rectangles formed by perpendicular diameters would be different.\n\n   Wait, actually, each pair of perpendicular diameters would form a rectangle, but since the diameters are at 30-degree angles, each pair is unique.\n\n   So, perhaps 6 is correct.\n\n   But let me think again.\n\n   Each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular diameters, which are separated by 90 degrees.\n\n   Since there are 6 diameters, each separated by 30 degrees, the number of unique pairs of diameters separated by 90 degrees is 6.\n\n   Because starting from each diameter, there are two others at +90 and -90 degrees, but each pair is counted twice.\n\n   So, total number is 6.\n\n   So, 6 rectangles from diameters.\n\n   **Total so far: 6 (from 1 and 5) + 6 (from 2 and 4) + 6 (from 3 and 3) = 18 rectangles.**\n\n   But wait, in the diagram, only three are shown. So, maybe I'm overcounting.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles formed by the diameters are actually the same as the ones formed by the other cases.\n\n   Wait, no, because the rectangles formed by the diameters are larger, encompassing more vertices.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles formed by the 3 and 3 case are actually squares, and there are only three unique squares.\n\n   Wait, in a dodecagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a hexagon. Connecting every third vertex gives a square, because 12/3=4, so connecting every third vertex would give a square.\n\n   So, perhaps the rectangles formed by the 3 and 3 diagonals are actually squares, and there are three unique squares.\n\n   So, maybe in the 3 and 3 case, instead of 6", "answer": "315"}

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given properties:\n\n1. The sum of all the numbers in the list is 30.\n2. The only mode of the list is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list, and no other number is repeated as many times as 9.\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list at all.\n\nI need to find the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list. Hmm, okay. Let's think about each property and what it implies.\n\nStarting with the mode: the mode is 9, and it's unique. So, 9 must appear at least twice, and more times than any other number. So, if any other number appears, it can appear at most once less than the number of times 9 appears. But since we're dealing with positive integers, let's consider how many times 9 can appear.\n\nNext, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the median is not in the list, that tells us something about the length of the list and the distribution of numbers around the median.\n\nLet me denote the number of elements in the list as n. Since the median is not in the list, n must be even. Because if n were odd, the median would be the middle number, which would be part of the list. So, n is even. Let's say n = 2k for some integer k.\n\nThe median would then be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers. But since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that average must be an integer, meaning the two middle numbers must be equal. Wait, but if the median is not in the list, then the two middle numbers can't both be 9 because 9 is the mode. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no. If the median is not in the list, then the two middle numbers must average to a number that's not in the list. But since the median is an integer, the two middle numbers must be equal, right? Because their average is an integer. So, if the two middle numbers are equal, say m, then m is the median, and m is not in the list. But if m is not in the list, but it's the average of two numbers in the list, which are both m, then m must be in the list. Wait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, hold on. If the two middle numbers are both m, then m is in the list, but the median is m, which is not in the list. That can't happen. So, maybe the two middle numbers are different, but their average is an integer. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are m-1 and m+1, their average is m, which is not in the list. That makes sense because m is the median, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, in that case, the two middle numbers are consecutive integers, and their average is the median, which is an integer not present in the list. So, that seems possible.\n\nSo, n is even, and the two middle numbers are consecutive integers, with their average being the median, which is not in the list.\n\nOkay, so let's try to figure out possible values for n.\n\nSince the mode is 9, and it's unique, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's assume the minimal case where 9 appears twice. Then, all other numbers can appear at most once.\n\nBut wait, if 9 appears twice, and all other numbers appear once, then the mode is 9, which is fine. But let's check the sum. The sum is 30, so if 9 appears twice, that's 18, so the remaining numbers must sum to 12. If n is 4, for example, then the list would have four numbers: two 9s and two other numbers summing to 12. But let's see if that works with the median condition.\n\nWait, n=4: the median would be the average of the second and third numbers. If the list is sorted, say, [a, b, c, d], then the median is (b + c)/2. Since the median is not in the list, (b + c)/2 is not equal to any of a, b, c, d. Also, the median is an integer, so b + c must be even.\n\nBut if 9 is the mode, appearing twice, then either a=9, b=9, or c=9, d=9. Let's say a=9, b=9, then c and d must be different numbers. The sum is 9 + 9 + c + d = 30, so c + d = 12. The median is (9 + c)/2. Since the median is not in the list, (9 + c)/2 is not equal to 9, c, or d.\n\nWait, if c is something else, say 3 and 9, but 9 is already in the list twice. Hmm, maybe c=6 and d=6, but then 6 would appear twice, which would make the mode 9 and 6, which contradicts the unique mode. So, 6 can't appear twice. So, c and d must be unique numbers.\n\nWait, let's try c=5 and d=7. Then, the list is [9,9,5,7]. The median is (9 + 5)/2 = 7, but 7 is in the list, so that's not allowed. Similarly, if c=4 and d=8, the median is (9 + 4)/2 = 6.5, which is not an integer, so that's invalid. If c=3 and d=9, but 9 is already in the list, so that's not allowed. Hmm, seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the list is [9,9,3,9], but that would make 9 appear three times, which is more than the other numbers, but in this case, all other numbers appear once, so 9 is the mode. But then the list is [3,9,9,9], sorted. The median is (9 + 9)/2 = 9, which is in the list, so that's not allowed. So, n=4 doesn't seem to work.\n\nLet me try n=6. So, the list has six numbers. The median is the average of the third and fourth numbers. Let's denote the sorted list as [a, b, c, d, e, f]. The median is (c + d)/2, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nSince the mode is 9, it must appear more times than any other number. So, 9 must appear at least twice, but let's see.\n\nIf 9 appears three times, then the other three numbers can appear at most twice each. But let's see.\n\nSum is 30, so if 9 appears three times, that's 27, so the remaining three numbers must sum to 3. Since they are positive integers, the only possibility is 1,1,1. But then 1 appears three times, which would make the mode 1 and 9, which contradicts the unique mode. So, 9 can't appear three times.\n\nAlternatively, if 9 appears twice, then the remaining four numbers must sum to 12. Let's see.\n\nSo, n=6, two 9s, and four other numbers summing to 12. Let's try to arrange them so that the median is not in the list.\n\nLet me try to have the list as [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9]. Sorted, it's [1,2,3,4,9,9]. The median is (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5, which is not an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1,1,2,2,9,9]. The median is (2 + 2)/2 = 2, which is in the list, so that's invalid.\n\nWait, maybe [1,2,3,5,9,9]. The median is (3 + 5)/2 = 4, which is not in the list. So, that works. Let's check the mode: 9 appears twice, and all others appear once. So, mode is 9, unique. The median is 4, which is not in the list. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 30. Perfect.\n\nSo, in this case, the list is [1,2,3,5,9,9]. The sum of squares is 1² + 2² + 3² + 5² + 9² + 9² = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 81 + 81 = let's calculate that: 1+4=5, 5+9=14, 14+25=39, 39+81=120, 120+81=201. So, the sum is 201.\n\nBut wait, is this the only possible list? Maybe there are other configurations.\n\nLet me try another one. Suppose the list is [1,1,2,2,9,9]. Wait, but then the median is (2 + 2)/2 = 2, which is in the list, so that's invalid.\n\nAnother try: [1,3,3,3,9,9]. The median is (3 + 3)/2 = 3, which is in the list, so invalid.\n\nHow about [2,2,3,3,9,9]. The median is (3 + 3)/2 = 3, which is in the list, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1,2,4,4,9,9]. The median is (4 + 4)/2 = 4, which is in the list, invalid.\n\nHmm, seems like the first list I found, [1,2,3,5,9,9], works. Let me see if there's another configuration.\n\nWhat if the list is [1,1,2,5,9,9]. The median is (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5, which is not an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nWait, but 3.5 is not an integer, so the median is not an integer, which contradicts the property that the median is a positive integer. So, that's invalid.\n\nSo, the median must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd so that their average is an integer.\n\nIn the list [1,2,3,5,9,9], the two middle numbers are 3 and 5, which are both odd, so their average is 4, an integer.\n\nIf I try another list: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 4 and 5, which are consecutive, so their average is 4.5, not an integer. So, invalid.\n\nAnother list: [1,3,3,5,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 3 and 5, average is 4, which is not in the list. So, that works. Let's check the sum: 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 30. Yes, that's correct. The mode is 9, appearing twice, and 3 appears twice as well. Wait, but that would make the mode not unique because both 3 and 9 appear twice. So, that's invalid because the mode must be unique.\n\nSo, that's a problem. So, in this case, 3 and 9 both appear twice, so the mode is not unique, which violates the second property.\n\nSo, that list is invalid.\n\nAnother attempt: [1,2,2,5,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 2 and 5, average is 3.5, not integer. So, invalid.\n\nWait, maybe [1,2,3,4,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 3 and 4, average is 3.5, not integer. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 3 and 6, average is 4.5, not integer. So, invalid.\n\nWait, maybe [1,2,4,6,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 4 and 6, average is 5, which is not in the list. So, that works. Let's check the sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 31. That's too much. We need the sum to be 30. So, that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1,2,3,5,9,9] sums to 30, which works. Let me see if I can find another list.\n\nHow about [1,2,3,5,9,9] as before. Sum is 30, median is 4, not in the list, mode is 9, unique. That works.\n\nAnother possibility: [1,2,3,5,9,9] is one list. Is there another list with n=6?\n\nWhat if the list is [1,1,3,7,9,9]. The sum is 1+1+3+7+9+9=30. The two middle numbers are 3 and 7, average is 5, which is not in the list. The mode is 9, appearing twice, and 1 appears twice. So, that's a problem because the mode is not unique. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1,2,2,7,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 2 and 7, average is 4.5, not integer. So, invalid.\n\nWait, [1,2,4,4,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 4 and 4, average is 4, which is in the list, so invalid.\n\nAnother idea: [1,3,3,5,9,9]. As before, the two middle numbers are 3 and 5, average is 4, not in the list. But 3 appears twice, same as 9, so mode is not unique. So, invalid.\n\nHmm, seems like the only valid list I can find is [1,2,3,5,9,9]. Let me check if there's another configuration with n=6.\n\nWhat if the list is [2,2,3,3,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 3 and 3, average is 3, which is in the list, so invalid.\n\nAlternatively, [1", "answer": "236"}

The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right in each row, the sum of the two numbers should be 999. Additionally, when I read the numbers top to bottom in each column, the sum of the three numbers should be 99. The example given is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHere, the first row is 008 and the second row is 991, so 008 + 991 = 999. The columns are 090, 099, and 81, so 0 + 9 + 81 = 99. \n\nOkay, so I need to generalize this. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the grid has 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will contain a unique digit from 0 to 9. So, we're essentially arranging 6 distinct digits in the grid.\n\nLet me denote the grid as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline a & b & c \\\\ \\hline d & e & f \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo, the first row is the number abc (which is 100a + 10b + c) and the second row is def (100d + 10e + f). The sum of these two numbers should be 999. Therefore:\n\n100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n\nSimilarly, for the columns, each column is a three-digit number. The first column is ad0 (10a + d), the second column is be0 (10b + e), and the third column is cf0 (10c + f). Wait, no, actually, in the example, the columns are 090, 099, and 81. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 81 is a two-digit number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the example, the columns are read top to bottom, so the first column is 0 and 9, which is 09, the second column is 0 and 9, which is 09, and the third column is 8 and 1, which is 81. Then, the sum is 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. So, actually, each column is a two-digit number if the top digit is zero, or a one-digit number if the bottom digit is zero. But in the problem statement, it says \"výtvořených čtením shora dolů\", which translates to \"formed by reading top to bottom\". So, each column is a two-digit number, but if the top digit is zero, it's effectively a one-digit number. However, in the sum, 09 is considered as 9, right? Because 09 is 9. Similarly, 09 is 9, and 81 is 81, so 9 + 9 + 81 = 99.\n\nSo, in general, each column is a two-digit number, but if the top digit is zero, it's treated as a one-digit number. So, the sum of the three column numbers is 99.\n\nTherefore, for the columns:\n\n- First column: 10a + d\n- Second column: 10b + e\n- Third column: 10c + f\n\nBut if a or b or c is zero, then the column is effectively a one-digit number. So, the sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. But wait, in the example, it's 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So, 10a + d = 9, 10b + e = 9, and 10c + f = 81. So, that's 9 + 9 + 81 = 99.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three column numbers is 99, where each column number is either a one-digit or two-digit number, depending on whether the top digit is zero.\n\nSo, to model this, we can think of each column as contributing either a single digit (if the top digit is zero) or a two-digit number (if the top digit is non-zero). So, the sum of these three contributions is 99.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the two row numbers is 999. So, the first row is a three-digit number, the second row is another three-digit number, and their sum is 999.\n\nSo, let's write down the equations.\n\nFirst, the row sum:\n\n100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999\n\nSimilarly, the column sum:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999\n2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes:\n\n100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nSimilarly, let me denote T1 = a + b + c, T2 = d + e + f. Then equation 2 becomes:\n\n10T1 + T2 = 99\n\nSo, we have:\n\n100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999  ...(1)\n\n10T1 + T2 = 99  ...(2)\n\nAlso, note that S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f\n\nAnd T1 = a + b + c, T2 = d + e + f\n\nSo, T1 + T2 = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nTherefore, T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nBut from equation (2), 10T1 + T2 = 99\n\nSo, let's see if we can express S1, S2, S3 in terms of T1 and T2.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n10T1 + T2 = 99\n\nAnd T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nEquation (1): 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nEquation (3): T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nEquation (2): 10T1 + T2 = 99\n\nSo, from equation (2), we can express T2 = 99 - 10T1\n\nSubstitute into equation (3):\n\nT1 + (99 - 10T1) = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99 - 9T1 = S1 + S2 + S3\n\nBut from equation (1), 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nLet me denote equation (1) as:\n\n100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nAnd from equation (3):\n\nS1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9T1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\n2. S1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9T1\n\nBut T1 is a variable here. Hmm, maybe we can find possible values for S1, S2, S3.\n\nLooking at equation (1):\n\n100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\n\nThis is a three-digit number where S1 is the hundreds digit, S2 is the tens digit, and S3 is the units digit. So, S1 must be 9 because 100*9 = 900, and 999 - 900 = 99. Then, 10S2 + S3 = 99. So, S2 must be 9 and S3 must be 9. Because 10*9 + 9 = 99.\n\nTherefore, S1 = 9, S2 = 9, S3 = 9.\n\nSo, from equation (1), we have S1 = 9, S2 = 9, S3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, equation (3):\n\nS1 + S2 + S3 = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27\n\nSo, 27 = 99 - 9T1\n\nTherefore, 9T1 = 99 - 27 = 72\n\nSo, T1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nTherefore, T1 = 8\n\nAnd from equation (2):\n\nT2 = 99 - 10T1 = 99 - 80 = 19\n\nSo, T1 = 8, T2 = 19\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nS1 = a + d = 9\n\nS2 = b + e = 9\n\nS3 = c + f = 9\n\nAnd:\n\nT1 = a + b + c = 8\n\nT2 = d + e + f = 19\n\nSo, now, we have the following system:\n\n1. a + d = 9\n\n2. b + e = 9\n\n3. c + f = 9\n\n4. a + b + c = 8\n\n5. d + e + f = 19\n\nSo, we need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0-9, all distinct) satisfying these equations.\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\nFrom 1: d = 9 - a\n\nFrom 2: e = 9 - b\n\nFrom 3: f = 9 - c\n\nFrom 4: a + b + c = 8\n\nFrom 5: d + e + f = 19\n\nSubstituting d, e, f from 1,2,3 into equation 5:\n\n(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 19\n\nSimplify:\n\n27 - (a + b + c) = 19\n\nBut from equation 4, a + b + c = 8, so:\n\n27 - 8 = 19\n\nWhich is 19 = 19. So, this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the system is consistent, and we just need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f such that:\n\na + b + c = 8\n\nd = 9 - a\n\ne = 9 - b\n\nf = 9 - c\n\nAnd all digits a, b, c, d, e, f are distinct and from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 8, with a, b, c distinct digits, and then d, e, f are determined as 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, which must also be distinct and not overlapping with a, b, c.\n\nAdditionally, since the grid is 2x3, the digits are placed as a, b, c in the first row and d, e, f in the second row. So, all six digits must be distinct.\n\nSo, let's find all possible triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are distinct digits from 0 to 9, a + b + c = 8, and d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c are also distinct and different from a, b, c.\n\nSo, first, let's list all possible triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 8, a, b, c distinct.\n\nWe can consider a, b, c as digits from 0 to 8, since their sum is 8.\n\nBut since a, b, c are digits, they can be 0 to 9, but their sum is 8, so each is at most 8.\n\nBut also, since d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, and d, e, f must be distinct and not equal to a, b, c.\n\nSo, let's consider all possible ordered triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 8, a, b, c distinct, and then check if d, e, f are distinct and not overlapping with a, b, c.\n\nBut since the grid is 2x3, the order matters, so different permutations count as different grids.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's about placing digits into the grid, so each cell is distinct, so the order matters. So, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of valid assignments of digits to cells, considering the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to first find all possible sets {a, b, c} such that a + b + c = 8, a, b, c distinct, and then for each such set, check if {d, e, f} = {9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c} are distinct and disjoint from {a, b, c}.\n\nThen, for each valid set, the number of permutations is 3! for the first row and 3! for the second row, so 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nBut wait, actually", "answer": "45"}

The problem gives me a system of three logarithmic equations:\n\n1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to solve for x, y, z first, right? Because once I have their values, I can compute the expression they're asking for.\n\nLet me recall that log₂(a) = b is equivalent to a = 2ᵇ. So, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. That means x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = √2. So, equation 1 becomes:\n\nx = √2 * y * z.  [Equation 1]\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So, y/(x z) = 2^(1/3). Therefore:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x * z.  [Equation 2]\n\nAnd the third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So, z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). Therefore:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x * y.  [Equation 3]\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1. x = √2 * y * z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x * z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x * y\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to solve for one variable.\n\nLet me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, x = √2 * y * z. So, plug this into equation 2:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (√2 * y * z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * √2 * y * z²\n\nFirst, let's compute 2^(1/3) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So, equation becomes:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z²\n\nHmm, let's divide both sides by y (assuming y ≠ 0, which it isn't because it's positive):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z²\n\nSo, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we can ignore the negative root.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me write that as z = 1 / 2^(5/12). Okay, so now I have z in terms of exponents.\n\nNow, let's plug z back into equation 1 to find x in terms of y.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).\n\nCompute 1/2 - 5/12: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12. So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Therefore, x = 2^(1/12) * y. [Equation 4]\n\nNow, let's plug z into equation 3 as well. From equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x * y\n\nLet me write 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12). So, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(3/12) * x * y.\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(3/12):\n\n2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = x * y\n\nWhich is 2^(-8/12) = x * y, simplifying to 2^(-2/3) = x * y.\n\nSo, x * y = 2^(-2/3). [Equation 5]\n\nBut from equation 4, x = 2^(1/12) * y. So, plug that into equation 5:\n\n(2^(1/12) * y) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, 2^(1/12) * y² = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny² = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Now, let's find x from equation 4: x = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8).\n\nCompute 1/12 - 3/8: 1/12 is 2/24, 3/8 is 9/24, so 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. So, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNow, I need to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.\n\nFirst, let's compute x⁴ y³ z².\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))⁴ = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny³ = (2^(-3/8))³ = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz² = (2^(-5/12))² = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for the exponents. 6 and 8 have a common denominator of 24.\n\nConvert each exponent:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo, adding them together: -28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Both 75 and 24 are divisible by 3.\n\n75 ÷ 3 = 25, 24 ÷ 3 = 8. So, -25/8.\n\nTherefore, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of logarithmic equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nWe rewrite each equation in exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\implies x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot z\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\implies y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot x \\cdot z\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\implies z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot x \\cdot y\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot z\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot (2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot z) \\cdot z \\implies y = 2^{5/6} \\cdot y \\cdot z^2 \\implies 1 = 2^{5/6} \\cdot z^2 \\implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\implies z = 2^{-5/12} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12} \\implies x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[ 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \\cdot x \\cdot y \\implies 2^{-5/12} = 2^{3/12} \\cdot x \\cdot y \\implies 2^{-8/12} = x \\cdot y \\implies x \\cdot y = 2^{-2/3} \\]\n\nUsing \\(x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y\\):\n\n\\[ (2^{1/12} \\cdot y) \\cdot y = 2^{-2/3} \\implies 2^{1/12} \\cdot y^2 = 2^{-2/3} \\implies y^2 = 2^{-9/12} \\implies y = 2^{-3/8} \\]\n\nThen, \\(x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot 2^{-3/8} = 2^{-7/24}\\).\n\nNow, we compute \\(| \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) |\\):\n\n\\[ x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6} \\]\n\\[ y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8} \\]\n\\[ z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\]\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[ x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \\cdot 2^{-9/8} \\cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} \\]\n\nConverting to a common denominator (24):\n\n\\[ -7/6 = -28/24, \\quad -9/8 = -27/24, \\quad -5/6 = -20/24 \\]\n\\[ -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8 \\]\n\nThus, \\(x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\\), so:\n\n\\[ \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8 \\implies | -25/8 | = 25/8 \\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{25}{8}\\) is in simplest form, so \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\).

Najděte délku strany šestiúhelníku.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of these extended sides are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the length of each side of the hexagon.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, but the angles can vary. Since all opposite sides are parallel, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in some way. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF suggests that these sides are not just any sides but are extended beyond the hexagon to form a triangle.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the triangle formed by extending these sides is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon. Maybe I can use some properties of similar triangles or parallelograms here.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being composed of parallelograms. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. If I place the hexagon on a coordinate system, I can assign coordinates to each vertex and then use the given lengths of the triangle to set up equations.\n\nLet me try that. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Since it's a convex hexagon, I can assume it's labeled in order, so the points go A, B, C, D, E, F, and back to A.\n\nSince opposite sides are parallel, the vectors AB, CD, and EF should be equal in direction and magnitude. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length. But here, it's just equilateral, so sides are equal, but angles can differ.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the hexagon as being formed by vectors. Let me think of each side as a vector in the plane. Since opposite sides are parallel, their vectors are scalar multiples of each other. But since it's equilateral, the magnitudes are equal, so they must be equal vectors or negatives.\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, each side is a rotation of the previous one by 60 degrees. But here, since it's only equilateral and not necessarily regular, the angles between sides can vary, but opposite sides are parallel.\n\nThis is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should think about the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let's denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB.\n\nGiven that AB, CD, and EF are extended to form triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, and 300. So, the sides of triangle PQR correspond to the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.\n\nI think the key here is to relate the side length 's' of the hexagon to the sides of triangle PQR. Maybe using similar triangles or some ratio.\n\nLet me consider the lines AB, CD, and EF. Since they are opposite sides of the hexagon and are parallel, the distances between them might be related to the side length 's'.\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite sides is 2 times the side length times the square root of 3 divided by 2, which is the height of each equilateral triangle. But in this case, the hexagon is not regular, so the distances might not be uniform.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle PQR. The sides of this triangle are proportional to the extensions of the hexagon's sides.\n\nLet me denote the extensions beyond the hexagon as x, y, z. So, the total length of each side of the triangle would be the side length of the hexagon plus the extensions. For example, side PQ would be the extension of AB beyond B and beyond A, so PQ = x + s + y, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. If I consider the vectors representing the sides AB, BC, CD, etc., and since opposite sides are parallel, their vectors are equal or negatives.\n\nBut since it's a convex hexagon, the vectors should be arranged such that each consecutive vector is a rotation of the previous one by some angle, but not necessarily 60 degrees.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a formula or theorem related to equilateral convex hexagons with opposite sides parallel and the triangle formed by extending their sides.\n\nI recall that in such cases, the triangle formed is similar to the triangle formed by connecting every other vertex of the hexagon. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of homothety. If the triangle PQR is a homothety of the hexagon, then the ratio of similarity can be used to find the side length.\n\nWait, homothety might be the key here. If the triangle is formed by extending the sides, it's likely a homothetic transformation. The center of homothety would be the intersection point of AB and CD, which is point P.\n\nSimilarly, the other sides would also meet at points Q and R. So, triangle PQR is the image of the hexagon under a homothety transformation.\n\nIn homothety, the ratio of similarity can be determined by the distances from the center to the corresponding points. So, if I can find the ratio, I can relate the side length of the hexagon to the sides of the triangle.\n\nBut I don't know the exact ratio yet. Maybe I can express the sides of the triangle in terms of the side length 's' and the ratio.\n\nLet me denote the homothety ratio as k. Then, the sides of triangle PQR would be k times the corresponding sides of the hexagon. But wait, the sides of the hexagon are all equal, so the sides of the triangle would be k*s, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, which are different.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe the homothety ratio is different for each side? Or perhaps the triangle is not similar to the hexagon but to another triangle.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the triangle formed by the extensions as a larger triangle that the hexagon is inscribed in. So, the hexagon is inscribed in triangle PQR, with each side of the hexagon lying on a side of the triangle.\n\nBut in that case, the hexagon would have to be equilateral and with opposite sides parallel, which is the case here.\n\nI think I need to use the concept of similar triangles and set up proportions based on the side lengths.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, each side of the hexagon is a part of the sides of triangle PQR. So, the sides of triangle PQR are composed of the sides of the hexagon and some extensions.\n\nBut since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the extensions beyond each side of the hexagon would form similar triangles.\n\nWait, maybe each side of the triangle PQR is divided into three segments: the side of the hexagon and two extensions. So, for example, side PQ of triangle PQR is equal to AB + extension1 + extension2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each side of the triangle is equal to twice the side length of the hexagon. But in the problem, the sides are 200, 240, 300, which are different, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle PQR is similar to the triangle formed by connecting every other vertex of the hexagon. Let me think.\n\nIf I connect every other vertex of the hexagon, I get a triangle inside the hexagon. But in this case, the triangle is formed by extending the sides, so it's outside.\n\nMaybe the ratio of the sides of triangle PQR to the sides of the inner triangle is related to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the area ratios or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: in such a hexagon, the sides can be considered as vectors, and since opposite sides are parallel, the vectors AB, CD, EF are equal in magnitude and direction.\n\nSo, if I consider the vectors, the sum of the vectors around the hexagon should be zero because it's a closed polygon.\n\nSo, vector AB + vector BC + vector CD + vector DE + vector EF + vector FA = 0.\n\nBut since opposite sides are parallel, vector AB = vector CD = vector EF, and vector BC = vector DE = vector FA.\n\nWait, no, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are equal and parallel, but here, it's just equilateral, so the vectors might be equal in magnitude but different in direction.\n\nWait, no, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are not only equal in magnitude but also in direction, but in this case, it's just equilateral with opposite sides parallel, so the vectors could be in the same or opposite directions.\n\nBut since it's convex, the vectors must be turning in the same direction, so probably all in the same direction.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the hexagon as a centrally symmetric figure, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use complex numbers to represent the vertices.\n\nLet me try that. Let me place point A at 0 in the complex plane. Then, each subsequent point can be represented as a complex number.\n\nSince all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the vectors between consecutive points are equal in magnitude but may differ in direction by 60 degrees or something.\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, each consecutive side is rotated by 60 degrees. But here, it's not necessarily regular, so the angles can vary.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, I remember that in such a hexagon, the triangle formed by the extensions is called the outer Napoleon triangle or something similar. Maybe there's a formula relating the side length of the hexagon to the sides of this triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and set up proportions.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, each side of the triangle PQR is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon. So, for example, side PQ is formed by extending AB beyond B and beyond A.\n\nLet me denote the extension beyond B as 'a' and beyond A as 'b'. Similarly, for the other sides.\n\nBut since all sides are equal, the extensions should be related in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the triangle PQR is similar to the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the hexagon, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the law of cosines on triangle PQR, but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, another idea: since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, it can be inscribed in a triangle, and the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon.\n\nI think the key is to realize that the triangle PQR is similar to the triangle formed by connecting every other vertex of the hexagon, but scaled by a factor related to the side length 's'.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a homothety that maps the hexagon to the triangle.\n\nWait, homothety is a dilation (scaling) from a point. If I can find the center of homothety, maybe I can relate the side lengths.\n\nBut without knowing the center, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can find the ratios of the sides.\n\nGiven that the sides of triangle PQR are 200, 240, 300, which are in the ratio 200:240:300, which simplifies to 10:12:15, or 5:6:7.5.\n\nWait, 200, 240, 300 can be divided by 20, giving 10, 12, 15. So, the ratios are 10:12:15.\n\nSo, the sides of triangle PQR are in the ratio 10:12:15.\n\nIf I can find the ratio of the side length 's' of the hexagon to the sides of triangle PQR, I can find 's'.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe the sides of triangle PQR are proportional to the sum of the sides of the hexagon.\n\nBut the sides of the hexagon are all equal, so that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each side of triangle PQR is equal to 2s, but since the sides are different, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the sides of triangle PQR are each equal to s multiplied by some factor related to the angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle PQR is similar to the triangle formed by connecting every other vertex of the hexagon, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: in such a hexagon, the distance between two opposite sides is equal to 2s times the sine of the angle between them.\n\nBut since the hexagon is not regular, the angles can vary, so this might not help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of the area. The area of the hexagon can be related to the area of triangle PQR.\n\nBut I don't know the area of the hexagon, so that might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the hexagon can be divided into smaller triangles or parallelograms, and relate their areas to the triangle PQR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry by assigning coordinates to the hexagon and then solving for 's'.\n\nLet me try that. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since AB is a side, let me place point B at (s,0). Now, since opposite sides are parallel, the side CD is also length 's' and is parallel to AB, so it must be a horizontal line as well.\n\nBut wait, in a convex hexagon, the sides can't all be horizontal. Wait, no, only opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DE, and CD is parallel to EF.\n\nWait, no, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So, AB is opposite to ED, BC is opposite to FE, and CD is opposite to AF.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. In a hexagon ABCDEF, the opposite sides are AB and ED, BC and EF, CD and FA.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So, AB is opposite to ED, BC is opposite to FE, and CD is opposite to AF.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the exact definition. But since the problem says \"všechny dvojice protilehlých stran rovnoběžné\", which translates to \"all pairs of opposite sides are parallel\". So, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So, AB is opposite to ED, BC is opposite to FE, and CD is opposite to AF.\n\nSo, in that case", "answer": "80"}

Then Bob writes down all possible non-empty finite subsets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such subsets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in set A.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what Bob is doing. He's considering all finite, non-empty subsets of positive integers where the maximum element is in Alice's set A. So, for each element in A, say 'a', Bob can form subsets where 'a' is the maximum. \n\nIf A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then for each ai, the number of subsets where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., ai-1}. Because for each ai, any subset of the numbers less than ai can be combined with ai to form a subset where ai is the maximum. \n\nWait, but actually, the set of positive integers is infinite, so if A contains elements like 1, 2, 3, etc., the number of subsets where ai is the maximum would be 2^{ai-1}. Because for each ai, the subsets can include any combination of numbers less than ai, and ai itself. So, the number of subsets where ai is the maximum is 2^{ai-1}.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says Bob writes down all finite non-empty subsets. So, for each ai in A, the number of subsets where ai is the maximum is 2^{ai-1} - 1? Wait, no, because the subsets can be any size, including singletons. So, actually, for each ai, the number of subsets where ai is the maximum is 2^{ai-1}. Because for each ai, you can choose any subset of the numbers less than ai, and then add ai to it. Since the numbers less than ai are 1, 2, ..., ai-1, which are ai-1 numbers, so the number of subsets is 2^{ai-1}.\n\nBut wait, the problem says Bob writes down all finite non-empty subsets. So, if A is a finite set, say with n elements, then the total number of subsets Bob writes is the sum over each ai in A of 2^{ai-1}. So, the total number of subsets is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.\n\nSo, the equation we have is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.\n\nOur goal is to find the sum of the elements in A, which is sum_{a in A} a.\n\nSo, we need to find a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} over all a in A is 2024, and then find the sum of the elements in A.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let's note that 2024 is a specific number. Let me factorize 2024 to see if that helps.\n\n2024 divided by 2 is 1012.\n\n1012 divided by 2 is 506.\n\n506 divided by 2 is 253.\n\n253 is 11 times 23, right? 11*23=253.\n\nSo, 2024 factors into 2^3 * 11 * 23.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet, but maybe.\n\nNow, the sum of 2^{a-1} over a in A is 2024. So, 2024 is equal to the sum of powers of 2. Let me think about how to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n\nWait, 2024 in binary is... Let me compute that.\n\n2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0.\n\n1012 /2=506, rem 0.\n\n506/2=253, rem 0.\n\n253/2=126 rem 1.\n\n126/2=63, rem 0.\n\n63/2=31 rem 1.\n\n31/2=15 rem 1.\n\n15/2=7 rem 1.\n\n7/2=3 rem 1.\n\n3/2=1 rem 1.\n\n1/2=0 rem 1.\n\nSo, writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, let me count the number of divisions: 11 steps, so 11 bits.\n\nSo, 2024 in binary is 11111101000.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n11111101000 is:\n\nFrom right to left:\n\nPositions: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nBits:        1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo, value is:\n\n2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 0 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0\n\nCompute:\n\n2^10=1024\n\n2^9=512\n\n2^8=256\n\n2^7=128\n\n2^6=64\n\n2^5=32\n\n2^3=8\n\nAdding these up: 1024+512=1536; 1536+256=1792; 1792+128=1920; 1920+64=1984; 1984+32=2016; 2016+8=2024. Perfect.\n\nSo, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.\n\nSo, the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024, which is equal to the sum of distinct powers of 2: 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10.\n\nTherefore, each term in the sum corresponds to 2^{a-1} = 2^k, so a-1 = k, so a = k + 1.\n\nTherefore, the elements a in A are 3+1=4, 5+1=6, 6+1=7, 7+1=8, 8+1=9, 9+1=10, 10+1=11.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, 2^{a-1} is each term, so if 2^{a-1} = 2^k, then a-1 = k, so a = k + 1.\n\nSo, the exponents in the binary representation correspond to a-1, so a = exponent + 1.\n\nSo, the exponents in 2024's binary representation are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nTherefore, a-1 = 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, so a = 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nTherefore, set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.\n\nSo, the sum of elements in A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\n10 + 7 = 17\n\n17 + 8 = 25\n\n25 + 9 = 34\n\n34 + 10 = 44\n\n44 + 11 = 55.\n\nSo, the sum is 55.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is this the only possible set A? Because 2024 can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2 in only one way, since binary representation is unique. So, the set A must be exactly {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 55.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's compute the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A.\n\nFor a=4: 2^{3}=8\n\na=6: 2^{5}=32\n\na=7: 2^{6}=64\n\na=8: 2^{7}=128\n\na=9: 2^{8}=256\n\na=10: 2^{9}=512\n\na=11: 2^{10}=1024\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 32 = 40; 40 + 64 = 104; 104 + 128 = 232; 232 + 256 = 488; 488 + 512 = 1000; 1000 + 1024 = 2024. Perfect, that adds up.\n\nSo, the set A is indeed {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum is 55.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the elements in set \\( A \\) is \\boxed{55}.\n</think>\n\nAlice picks a set \\( A \\) of positive integers. Bob writes down all possible non-empty finite subsets \\( B \\) of positive integers where the maximum element of \\( B \\) is in \\( A \\). The total number of such subsets \\( B \\) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in set \\( A \\).\n\nFirst, we note that for each element \\( a \\) in \\( A \\), the number of subsets where \\( a \\) is the maximum is \\( 2^{a-1} \\). Therefore, the total number of subsets is the sum of \\( 2^{a-1} \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( A \\). This sum is given as 2024.\n\nWe factorize 2024 and find its binary representation:\n\\[ 2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \\]\n\nThis corresponds to the exponents 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

Najděte $Q+R$.", "response": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest four-digit positive integer N with a special property. The property is that if I change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder, and then find Q + R. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. It's the largest such number, meaning I need to find the biggest number in that range that satisfies the condition. The condition is that if I change any single digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B gives A1CD, changing C gives AB1D, and changing D gives ABC1, and each of these must be divisible by 7.\n\nSince N is the largest such number, I should probably start from 9999 and work my way down until I find a number that satisfies the condition. But that might take a long time, so maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of numbers divisible by 7. Divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as, say, divisibility by 3 or 9, where you can just sum the digits. For 7, there are some rules, but they're more complicated. Maybe I can use modular arithmetic here.\n\nLet me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.\n\nNow, when I change one digit to 1, say the thousands digit, the new number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d, and so on.\n\nEach of these modified numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. So, mathematically, we can write:\n\n1. 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, these are four congruences that must hold simultaneously.\n\nLet me compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify these expressions.\n\nFirst, 1000 mod 7: 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, 100 mod 7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 - 98 = 2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\n10 mod 7 is 3, since 10 - 7 = 3.\n\n1 mod 7 is 1.\n\nSo, substituting these into the four congruences:\n\n1. 6*1 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 6a + 2*1 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 6a + 2b + 3*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, simplifying each:\n\n1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nNow, let's denote these as equations:\n\nEquation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7. Since -6 mod 7 is 1, this becomes 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nEquation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7. -2 mod 7 is 5, so 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7.\n\nEquation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod 7. -3 mod 7 is 4, so 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7.\n\nEquation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod 7. -1 mod 7 is 6, so 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\nSo now, we have four equations:\n\n1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7\n2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7\n3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7\n4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nNow, let's see if we can solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nEquation (2) - Equation (1):\n\n(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):\n\n3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nSo, 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's note this as equation (5).\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) - Equation (1):\n\n(6a + 2b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 4 - 1 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):\n\n2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSo, 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7. Let's note this as equation (6).\n\nNow, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):\n\nEquation (4) - Equation (3):\n\n(6a + 2b + 3c) - (6a + 2b + d) ≡ 6 - 4 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nSo, 3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's note this as equation (7).\n\nNow, let's summarize the equations we have:\n\nEquation (5): 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nEquation (6): 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nEquation (7): 3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nAnd equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSo, we have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation (5): 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7 => b ≡ 3a - 2 mod 7\n\nFrom equation (6): 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7 => c ≡ 2a - 1 mod 7\n\nFrom equation (7): 3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7 => d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7\n\nSo, we can express b, c, d in terms of a.\n\nLet me write these:\n\nb = (3a - 2) mod 7\n\nc = (2a - 1) mod 7\n\nd = (3c - 2) mod 7\n\nBut since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9 for b, c, d; 1-9 for a), we can express them as:\n\nb = (3a - 2) mod 7, but since b must be between 0 and 9, we can write b = (3a - 2) + 7k, where k is an integer such that b is in 0-9.\n\nSimilarly for c and d.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express c in terms of a, then d in terms of c, which is in terms of a, and then plug into equation (1).\n\nSo, let's substitute c into d:\n\nd = 3c - 2 mod 7\n\nBut c = 2a - 1 mod 7, so:\n\nd = 3*(2a - 1) - 2 mod 7\n\n= (6a - 3 - 2) mod 7\n\n= (6a - 5) mod 7\n\nSo, d = (6a - 5) mod 7\n\nSimilarly, b = (3a - 2) mod 7\n\nSo, now, let's substitute b, c, d into equation (1):\n\n2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*(3a - 2) + 3*(2a - 1) + (6a - 5) ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2*(3a - 2) = 6a - 4\n\n3*(2a - 1) = 6a - 3\n\n(6a - 5) remains as is.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(6a - 4) + (6a - 3) + (6a - 5) = 18a - 12\n\nSo, 18a - 12 ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSimplify 18a mod 7: 18 divided by 7 is 2*7=14, remainder 4, so 18 ≡ 4 mod 7. So, 18a ≡ 4a mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, -12 mod 7: 12 divided by 7 is 1*7=7, remainder 5, so -12 ≡ -5 mod 7, which is 2 mod 7.\n\nSo, 4a + 2 ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n4a ≡ -1 mod 7 => 4a ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nNow, solve for a:\n\n4a ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod 7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 4 is 2.\n\nThus, a ≡ 6*2 mod7 => a ≡12 mod7 => a≡5 mod7\n\nSo, a ≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit from 1 to 9, possible values for a are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit, so a=5.\n\nSo, a=5.\n\nNow, let's find b, c, d.\n\nFrom equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7. Since a=5,\n\nb ≡3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So, b=6 or 6+7=13, but since b is a digit, b=6.\n\nFrom equation (6): c ≡2a -1 mod7. a=5,\n\nc≡2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So, c=2 or 2+7=9. Since c is a digit, c=2 or 9.\n\nFrom equation (7): d≡3c -2 mod7.\n\nCase 1: c=2,\n\nd≡3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So, d=4 or 4+7=11, but d is a digit, so d=4.\n\nCase 2: c=9,\n\nd≡3*9 -2=27-2=25≡4 mod7 (since 25-21=4). So, d=4 or 11, but d=4.\n\nSo, regardless of c=2 or 9, d=4.\n\nSo, now, we have a=5, b=6, c=2 or 9, d=4.\n\nSo, possible numbers are 5 6 2 4 and 5 6 9 4, which are 5624 and 5694.\n\nBut since we need the largest four-digit number, 5694 is larger than 5624, so N=5694.\n\nWait, but let me check if both satisfy the original condition.\n\nFirst, let's check N=5694.\n\nCheck changing each digit to 1:\n\n1. Change thousands digit: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by 7? Let's compute 1694 ÷7. 7*242=1694, so yes.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit: 5194. 5194 ÷7. 7*742=5194, so yes.\n\n3. Change tens digit: 5614. 5614 ÷7. 7*802=5614, yes.\n\n4. Change units digit: 5691. 5691 ÷7. 7*813=5691, yes.\n\nSo, 5694 works.\n\nNow, check N=5624.\n\nChange thousands digit: 1624. 1624 ÷7. 7*232=1624, yes.\n\nChange hundreds digit: 5124. 5124 ÷7. 7*732=5124, yes.\n\nChange tens", "answer": "699"}

Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a doughnut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. So, the torus is like a donut with a radius of 3 and the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the center of the torus.\n\nThen, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T is externally tangent to this sphere. So, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it at some point. The problem mentions two tangent planes: one where the torus is on the outside of the sphere, and another where it's on the inside. Wait, no, actually, it says when T is on the outer side of S, it's tangent, and when it's on the inner side, it's also tangent. So, there are two tangent circles where the torus touches the sphere, one from the outside and one from the inside.\n\nThe radii of these tangent circles are r_i and r_o, respectively. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and then to find m + n.\n\nAlright, so I need to find these two radii and subtract them. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a torus can be described in 3D space. The standard parametric equations for a torus are:\n\nx = (R + r cos θ) cos φ\ny = (R + r cos θ) sin φ\nz = r sin θ\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the center of the torus, and r is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think about the torus as a surface in 3D space. The sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.\n\nThe torus T is externally tangent to S. So, the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether it's external or internal tangency.\n\nWait, actually, the torus isn't a sphere, so the concept of distance between centers isn't directly applicable. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the cross-section of the torus and the sphere. If I take a cross-sectional view, the torus would look like a circle, and the sphere would also look like a circle. The tangent points would lie on the line connecting the centers of these two circles.\n\nBut in 3D, the torus is a surface, so the tangent points are more complex. Maybe I can use the concept of the distance from the center of the sphere to the torus.\n\nWait, the sphere is centered at the origin, right? Because in the Asymptote code, the sphere is drawn from (0,2.4) to (0,-1.75), so it's centered at (0,0,0). The torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The axis is at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle, so the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). So, the torus is centered at (0,0,0) with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.\n\nSo, the torus is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin with radius 11. So, the sphere is entirely inside the torus? Wait, no, because the torus has a major radius of 6 and minor radius 3, so the maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus is 6 + 3 = 9, and the minimum is 6 - 3 = 3. So, the sphere with radius 11 is larger than the torus, which extends from 3 to 9 units from the origin. So, the sphere encloses the torus.\n\nBut the problem says the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if the sphere is larger, the torus is inside the sphere. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6 from its center. So, the torus is like a donut with a hole. The sphere is of radius 11, so it's much larger. So, the torus is inside the sphere, but the sphere is outside. So, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the outside, meaning the torus is outside the sphere? But that can't be because the torus is inside the sphere.\n\nWait, maybe the sphere is inside the torus? No, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus extends up to 9 units from the center. So, the sphere is larger, enclosing the torus. So, the torus is inside the sphere, and when it's externally tangent, it's touching the sphere from the outside, meaning the sphere is outside the torus.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the terminology. In 3D, when two surfaces are externally tangent, it means they touch at a point, and their normals at that point are in the same direction. So, if the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the torus is outside the sphere, but in this case, the torus is inside the sphere. So, maybe the problem is considering the torus as being on the outside of the sphere, meaning the sphere is inside the torus? But the sphere is larger, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the torus is being considered as a separate object, not centered at the origin. Wait, no, the problem says the torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. So, the torus is centered at the origin, with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.\n\nSo, the sphere is also centered at the origin, with radius 11. So, the sphere is entirely inside the torus? No, because the torus only extends up to 9 units from the center, while the sphere goes up to 11. So, the sphere is outside the torus.\n\nWait, so the torus is inside the sphere, and the sphere is outside. So, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the outside, meaning the torus is outside the sphere? But that can't be because the torus is entirely inside the sphere.\n\nI'm confused. Maybe I need to think about the tangent planes. The problem mentions that when T is on the outer side of S, it's tangent, and when it's on the inner side, it's also tangent. So, perhaps the torus can be tangent to the sphere from the outside and from the inside, depending on how it's placed.\n\nWait, but the torus is fixed, right? It's generated by rotating a circle around an axis. So, maybe the sphere can be tangent to the torus in two different ways: one where the sphere is outside the torus, touching it from the outside, and another where the sphere is inside the torus, touching it from the inside.\n\nBut in this case, the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is fixed with major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, the sphere is larger, so it can't be inside the torus. So, the only way the sphere can be tangent to the torus is from the outside.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the torus as a separate object, not centered at the origin. Wait, no, the torus is centered at the origin because the axis of rotation is at a distance of 6 from the center of the generating circle, which is at (6,0,0). So, the torus is centered at the origin, with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.\n\nSo, the sphere is also centered at the origin, with radius 11. So, the sphere is entirely inside the torus? No, because the torus only extends up to 9 units from the center, while the sphere goes up to 11. So, the sphere is outside the torus.\n\nWait, so the sphere is outside the torus, and the torus is inside the sphere. So, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the outside, meaning the torus is outside the sphere? But that can't be because the torus is entirely inside the sphere.\n\nI'm getting more confused. Maybe I need to think about the cross-section.\n\nLet me consider a cross-sectional view of the torus and the sphere. The torus, when cut along the plane of rotation, looks like a circle of radius 3, centered at (6,0). The sphere, when cut along the same plane, is a circle of radius 11, centered at (0,0).\n\nSo, in this cross-section, the torus is a circle of radius 3 at (6,0), and the sphere is a circle of radius 11 at (0,0). The distance between their centers is 6 units.\n\nSo, in this cross-section, the two circles (the torus and the sphere) are separated by 6 units. The sphere has a much larger radius (11) compared to the torus (3). So, the sphere will enclose the torus, and the two circles will intersect or not?\n\nWait, the distance between centers is 6, and the sphere has radius 11, so the sphere will definitely enclose the torus. The torus is at (6,0) with radius 3, so the farthest point of the torus from the origin is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere does enclose the torus.\n\nSo, in this cross-section, the sphere is a large circle, and the torus is a smaller circle outside it? Wait, no, the torus is at (6,0) with radius 3, so in the cross-section, it's a circle that doesn't reach the origin. The sphere is a circle centered at the origin with radius 11, so it definitely encloses the torus.\n\nWait, so in this cross-section, the sphere is entirely outside the torus, except for the point where they touch. So, the sphere and the torus are tangent at one point in this cross-section.\n\nBut in reality, the torus is a 3D object, so the tangency would be along a circle, not a single point. So, in 3D, the sphere and the torus are tangent along a circle.\n\nSo, the problem mentions two tangent circles: one when the torus is on the outer side of the sphere, and one when it's on the inner side. Wait, but in this case, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, so how can it be on the outer side?\n\nWait, maybe the torus can be placed in two different positions relative to the sphere: one where it's externally tangent (touching from outside) and one where it's internally tangent (touching from inside). But in this problem, the torus is fixed, so maybe the sphere can be moved relative to the torus? But the sphere is fixed with radius 11.\n\nWait, no, the sphere is fixed, and the torus is fixed as well. So, the only way the torus can be tangent to the sphere is if they are in contact at certain points. But since the torus is entirely inside the sphere, the only way it can be tangent is from the inside.\n\nWait, but the problem says when T is on the outer side of S, it's tangent, and when it's on the inner side, it's also tangent. So, maybe the torus can be moved in such a way that it can be externally tangent or internally tangent to the sphere.\n\nBut in this problem, the torus is fixed, so maybe the sphere is moved? But the sphere is also fixed with radius 11. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the torus as a surface, and the sphere as another surface, and the tangent circles are the circles where the two surfaces touch. So, in 3D, the intersection of the torus and the sphere is a set of points, and the tangent circles are the loci where they touch.\n\nBut in reality, the intersection of a sphere and a torus is generally a set of points or curves, but in this case, since the sphere is much larger, it's likely that the intersection is a circle.\n\nWait, let me think about the cross-section again. In the cross-sectional view, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0). The distance between centers is 6. So, the two circles intersect when the sum of their radii is greater than or equal to the distance between centers.\n\nHere, the sphere's radius is 11, the torus's radius is 3, and the distance between centers is 6. So, 11 + 3 = 14, which is greater than 6, so they intersect. The intersection points can be found by solving the equations:\n\nSphere: x² + y² = 121\n\nTorus: (x - 6)² + y² = 9\n\nSubtracting the torus equation from the sphere equation:\n\nx² + y² - [(x - 6)² + y²] = 121 - 9\n\nx² - (x² - 12x + 36) = 112\n\nx² - x² + 12x - 36 = 112\n\n12x = 148\n\nx = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 ≈ 12.333\n\nWait, but the torus is centered at (6,0) with radius 3, so x ranges from 3 to 9. But 37/3 is approximately 12.333, which is outside the torus's x-range. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that the two circles don't intersect in this cross-section. But that contradicts the earlier thought that they do intersect because 11 + 3 > 6.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me write them again.\n\nSphere: x² + y² = 11² = 121\n\nTorus: (x - 6)² + y² = 3² = 9\n\nSubtracting the torus equation from the sphere equation:\n\nx² + y² - (x² - 12x + 36 + y²) = 121 - 9\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² +", "answer": "127"}

There are 25 white tokens and 25 black tokens, and they're all indistinguishable. I need to figure out how many ways I can place some of these tokens into the 25 cells of the grid following specific rules.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. The grid is 5x5, so there are 25 cells. Each cell can hold at most one token. The tokens are either white or black, and there are 25 of each, but I don't have to use all of them, right? Wait, actually, the problem says \"některé z těchto žetonů,\" which translates to \"some of these tokens.\" So I can place any number of white and black tokens, but each token is either white or black, and they're indistinct within their color.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n1. Each cell can have at most one token.\n2. All tokens in the same row must be the same color.\n3. All tokens in the same column must be the same color.\n4. Any additional token placed must not violate the first two constraints.\n\nSo, essentially, the grid must be colored in such a way that each row is monochromatic (all white or all black) and each column is monochromatic. Moreover, if I add any more tokens, it would break one of these constraints. That means the current configuration must be maximal in some sense—adding any token would violate either the row or column constraint.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"některé z těchto žetonů,\" so it's not necessarily all of them. So I can place some subset of the tokens, but each row and column must be monochromatic, and adding any more tokens would violate the row or column constraint.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of such maximal placements. That is, each placement is a subset of the grid where each row and column is entirely white or entirely black, and you can't add any more tokens without violating the row or column monochromaticity.\n\nHmm, okay. So, to model this, I can think of the grid as a 5x5 matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that every row is entirely white, entirely black, or empty, and similarly for every column.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the problem says that all tokens in the same row must be the same color, but it doesn't say that a row can't have no tokens. Similarly for columns. So, each row can be white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty. But the key is that if you have a token in a row, the entire row must be that color, and similarly for columns.\n\nBut the additional constraint is that adding any more tokens would violate the row or column monochromaticity. So, the current placement must be such that every empty cell is in a row that already has a token of some color, and in a column that already has a token of some color. Because if there's an empty cell, you could potentially place a token there without violating the row or column constraints, unless the row or column is already filled.\n\nWait, no. If a row is empty, you can't place a token in that row without violating the row constraint because the row would then have a single token, which would make it non-monochromatic. Similarly, if a column is empty, you can't place a token in that column without violating the column constraint.\n\nTherefore, for the placement to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that already has a token and a column that already has a token. Because otherwise, you could place a token in that empty cell without violating the constraints.\n\nSo, in other words, the set of rows that have tokens and the set of columns that have tokens must cover all the empty cells. That is, every empty cell is in a row with a token and a column with a token.\n\nTherefore, the placement must be such that the union of the rows with tokens and the columns with tokens covers the entire grid. So, if R is the set of rows with tokens and C is the set of columns with tokens, then for every cell (i,j), either i is in R or j is in C.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a covering in bipartite graphs, where the rows and columns are two disjoint sets, and the cells are edges. The sets R and C must cover all edges (cells).\n\nSo, in this case, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (R, C) where R is a subset of the 5 rows, C is a subset of the 5 columns, and for every cell (i,j), either i is in R or j is in C. Additionally, for each row in R, we choose a color (white or black), and for each column in C, we choose a color (white or black). However, we must ensure consistency: if a row and a column intersect, their colors must agree at their intersection.\n\nWait, that's an important point. If a row i is in R and column j is in C, then the cell (i,j) must be colored with both the color of row i and the color of column j. Therefore, the color of row i and the color of column j must be the same for all such cells (i,j). Otherwise, we would have a conflict.\n\nTherefore, the color assignments must satisfy that for every row i in R and column j in C, the color of row i equals the color of column j. So, in other words, all rows in R must have the same color, and all columns in C must have the same color, and these two colors must be the same.\n\nWait, no. Because if R and C are non-empty, then the color of the rows and the color of the columns must be consistent. That is, if a row is colored white, then all columns that intersect with that row must also be colored white. Similarly, if a column is colored black, all rows that intersect with that column must be colored black.\n\nTherefore, if R is non-empty and C is non-empty, then all rows in R must have the same color, and all columns in C must have the same color, and these two colors must be the same. Otherwise, there would be a conflict at the intersection of a row from R and a column from C.\n\nAlternatively, if R is empty, then all columns in C must be colored arbitrarily, but since R is empty, there are no constraints from rows, but since C must cover all cells, which would require that all columns are colored, but since R is empty, all cells are in columns in C, so all columns must be colored, but there's no constraint on their colors. Wait, but if R is empty, then the condition is that every cell is in a column in C, which is automatically true if C is the set of all columns. But if C is a proper subset, then cells not in C would be empty, but since R is empty, those cells are not in any row with tokens, so they can be empty. Wait, no, because if R is empty, then the condition is that every cell is in a column in C. So, if R is empty, then C must be all columns, because otherwise, there would be cells not in C, which would be empty, but since R is empty, those cells are allowed to be empty. Wait, no, the condition is that every empty cell must be in a row with a token or a column with a token. If R is empty, then every empty cell must be in a column with a token. So, if R is empty, then C must be all columns, because otherwise, there would be empty cells not in any column with tokens, which would violate the maximality condition.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure this.\n\nCase 1: R is empty. Then, since every empty cell must be in a column with a token, C must be all columns. So, all columns must have tokens. Each column can be independently colored white or black. However, since R is empty, there are no row constraints, so each column can be colored independently. But wait, if C is all columns, then all cells are in some column with a token, so all cells must be filled. But the problem says \"některé z těchto žetonů,\" which implies that we can place some, not necessarily all. So, if R is empty, then C must be all columns, but we can choose to place tokens in some subset of the cells, as long as every empty cell is in a column with a token. But if R is empty, then every empty cell must be in a column with a token, which is automatically true if C is all columns. So, in this case, we can place any number of tokens, one per cell, with each column colored either white or black, but since R is empty, there are no row constraints. However, the problem requires that each row can have at most one color, but if R is empty, then all rows are empty, so there are no row constraints. So, in this case, the number of placements is the number of ways to color each column either white or black, with any number of tokens placed, but each column can have any number of tokens from 0 to 5, but since we can only place one token per cell, each column can have 0 to 5 tokens, each colored either white or black. Wait, no, because each token is either white or black, but if we have multiple tokens in a column, they must all be the same color. So, for each column, we can choose a color (white or black) and decide how many tokens to place in that column, from 0 to 5. However, since we can only place one token per cell, each column can have between 0 and 5 tokens, each of the same color. But since we can choose any number, the number of ways for each column is 6 (0 to 5 tokens, each of a single color). But since the tokens are indistinct, the number of ways to color a column is 2 (white or black) multiplied by 6 (number of tokens), but actually, it's just 2 choices for the color, and for each color, the number of tokens can be from 0 to 5. However, since we can choose any number, but the tokens are indistinct, the number of ways per column is 2 * 6 = 12? Wait, no, because if we choose a color, the number of tokens is independent. So, for each column, we can choose a color (2 choices) and a number of tokens (6 choices), so 12 possibilities per column. But since the columns are independent, the total number of ways for all columns is 12^5. However, this counts all possible colorings, including those where some cells are empty. But in our problem, we can only place some tokens, not necessarily all. So, actually, for each column, we can choose a color and decide how many tokens to place in that column, from 0 to 5. So, for each column, 2 * 6 = 12 options, so total 12^5. But wait, this counts all possible assignments, but in our problem, we have to place some tokens, but the problem says \"některé z těchto žetonů,\" which is some, so at least one. But actually, the problem doesn't specify that we have to place at least one token, just some. So, including the case where no tokens are placed. But in our case, when R is empty, we have to place tokens in such a way that every empty cell is in a column with a token. But if R is empty, then all columns must have tokens, because otherwise, there would be empty cells not in any column with tokens. So, in this case, if R is empty, then C must be all columns, and each column must have at least one token. So, for each column, we can choose a color (2 choices) and a number of tokens from 1 to 5. So, for each column, 2 * 5 = 10 choices. Therefore, the total number of placements when R is empty is 10^5.\n\nWait, but hold on. If R is empty, then C must be all columns, and each column must have at least one token. So, for each column, we can choose a color (2 choices) and a number of tokens from 1 to 5. So, 2 * 5 = 10 options per column, hence 10^5 total.\n\nCase 2: R is non-empty. Then, we must have C non-empty as well, because otherwise, if C is empty, then all cells are empty, but since R is non-empty, there are tokens in some rows, but all cells in those rows are filled, but the rest of the grid is empty. However, the condition is that every empty cell must be in a column with a token. But if C is empty, then all empty cells are not in any column with a token, which would violate the maximality condition. Therefore, if R is non-empty, then C must also be non-empty.\n\nFurthermore, in this case, the colors of the rows and columns must be consistent. That is, all rows in R must be colored the same, and all columns in C must be colored the same, and these two colors must be the same. Because if a row is colored white, then all columns that intersect with that row must also be colored white, otherwise, the intersection cell would have conflicting colors.\n\nTherefore, in this case, we have two possibilities:\n- All rows in R are white, and all columns in C are white.\n- All rows in R are black, and all columns in C are black.\n\nSo, the color is determined by the choice of R and C.\n\nNow, for each such pair (R, C), where R is non-empty, C is non-empty, and R and C are consistent in color, we need to count the number of ways to place tokens such that every cell in R is filled with the chosen color, every cell in C is filled with the chosen color, and the rest of the cells (which are in neither R nor C) are empty.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the condition is that every empty cell must be in a row with a token or a column with a token. So, if R and C are fixed, then the cells that are empty must be in R or C. But actually, the cells that are empty are precisely those not in R or C. Wait, no. If R is the set of rows with tokens, and C is the set of columns with tokens, then the cells that are empty are those not in R or C. But the condition is that every empty cell must be in a row with a token or a column with a token. So, if a cell is empty, it must be in a row in R or a column in C. Therefore, the set of empty cells is a subset of (R x [5]) union ([5] x C). But actually, it's exactly the union, because if a cell is in R x [5], it's in a", "answer": "902"}
