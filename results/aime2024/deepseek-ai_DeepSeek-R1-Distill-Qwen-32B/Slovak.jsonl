Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and then stops at a café. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, her walk takes 4 hours, including t minutes spent at the café. Then, when she walks faster, at a speed of s + 2 km/h, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same t minutes at the café. Now, we need to find out how long her walk would take if she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes at the café.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me break this down. The key here is that the time she spends walking plus the time she spends at the café equals the total time given. So, for each scenario, we can write an equation.\n\nLet me denote the time she spends walking as T. So, in the first case, when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes T1 (walking time) plus t minutes. Similarly, in the second case, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is T2 (walking time) plus t minutes.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the total time includes t minutes at the café. So, actually, the total time is the walking time plus t minutes. So, for the first scenario, 4 hours is equal to the time she spends walking plus t minutes. Similarly, for the second scenario, 2 hours and 24 minutes is equal to the walking time plus t minutes.\n\nBut wait, 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So, maybe it's better to convert everything into minutes to make the calculations easier.\n\nLet me write down the equations.\n\nFirst scenario:\nWalking speed = s km/h\nDistance = 9 km\nTime walking = T1 hours\nTotal time = 4 hours = 240 minutes\nBut the total time is T1 hours plus t minutes. Wait, but T1 is in hours, and t is in minutes. So, to make the units consistent, I should convert T1 into minutes or t into hours.\n\nLet me convert everything into minutes. So, T1 in minutes would be 60 * T1, and t is already in minutes.\n\nSo, total time = 60*T1 + t = 240 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario:\nWalking speed = s + 2 km/h\nTime walking = T2 hours\nTotal time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes\nSo, 60*T2 + t = 144 minutes.\n\nAlso, since distance = speed * time, we can write:\n\nFor the first scenario:\n9 = s * T1\nSo, T1 = 9 / s hours.\n\nFor the second scenario:\n9 = (s + 2) * T2\nSo, T2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.\n\nNow, substituting T1 and T2 into the total time equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n60*(9/s) + t = 240\n\nSecond equation:\n60*(9/(s + 2)) + t = 144\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1) 540/s + t = 240\n2) 540/(s + 2) + t = 144\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t:\n\n[540/s + t] - [540/(s + 2) + t] = 240 - 144\n540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96\n\nSo, 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 96\n\nLet me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):\n\n1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) = 2/(s(s + 2))\n\nSo, 540*(2/(s(s + 2))) = 96\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1080)/(s(s + 2)) = 96\n\nMultiply both sides by s(s + 2):\n\n1080 = 96*s*(s + 2)\n\nDivide both sides by 96:\n\n1080 / 96 = s*(s + 2)\n\nSimplify 1080 / 96:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 90 / 8 = 45 / 4 = 11.25\n\nSo, s*(s + 2) = 11.25\n\nWhich is a quadratic equation:\n\ns^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nLet me solve for s using quadratic formula.\n\ns = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2\n\nBecause discriminant D = 4 + 4*11.25 = 4 + 45 = 49\n\nSo, sqrt(49) = 7\n\nThus, s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h or s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h\n\nSince speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nSo, Aya's walking speed is 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow, let's find t. Using the first equation:\n\n540/s + t = 240\n\ns = 2.5, so 540 / 2.5 = 216\n\nSo, 216 + t = 240 => t = 24 minutes.\n\nSo, t is 24 minutes.\n\nNow, the question is, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, how long does her walk take, including t minutes at the café.\n\nSo, first, find the walking time at 3 km/h.\n\nTime walking = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.\n\nConvert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes.\n\nTotal time = walking time + t = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nSo, 204 minutes is the total time.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, s = 2.5 km/h, so when she walks at 3 km/h, her walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, she spends t = 24 minutes at the café. So, total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me verify the initial equations.\n\nFirst scenario: s = 2.5 km/h, so walking time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes, which is 216 minutes. Then, t = 24 minutes, so total time is 216 + 24 = 240 minutes, which is 4 hours. That matches.\n\nSecond scenario: speed is s + 2 = 4.5 km/h. Walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Then, t = 24 minutes, so total time is 120 + 24 = 144 minutes, which is 2 hours and 24 minutes. That also matches.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, when she walks at 3 km/h, the total time is 204 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total time Aya's prechádzka trvá is \\boxed{204} minutes.\n</think>\n\nAya chodí každé ráno na prechádzku dlhú 9 kilometrov a potom sa zastaví v kaviarni.

Nájdite $m + n$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nWe have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to the circle ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-tangent point opposite to A, I think. Then, connecting A to D, which is outside the circle, and this line intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P.\n\nI remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC. That might be useful.\n\nAlso, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, is that right? Because the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector, and in this case, since D is the ex-tangent point, AD is the symmedian. Hmm, maybe I can use properties of symmedians here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D can also be expressed as DA * DP. So, maybe I can set up an equation using power of a point.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n1. AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.\n2. Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle ω.\n3. Tangents at B and C meet at D, so DB = DC.\n4. AD intersects ω again at P.\n5. Need to find AP.\n\nFirst, maybe I should compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its semiperimeter, area, circumradius, etc. That might help.\n\nLet me compute the semiperimeter (s) of triangle ABC:\n\ns = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nThen, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].\n\nSo, Δ = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 6] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt[504]: 504 = 16 * 31.5, wait, no. Let me factor 504:\n\n504 ÷ 2 = 252\n\n252 ÷ 2 = 126\n\n126 ÷ 2 = 63\n\n63 ÷ 3 = 21\n\n21 ÷ 3 = 7\n\nSo, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. Therefore, sqrt[504] = 2^(3/2) * 3^(2/2) * 7^(1/2) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, 7 is prime. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, area Δ = 6√14.\n\nNow, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:\n\nR = (a * b * c) / (4Δ)\n\nWhere a, b, c are the sides. Let me assign a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.\n\nSo, R = (9 * 10 * 5) / (4 * 6√14) = (450) / (24√14) = (75) / (4√14). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\n75/(4√14) * (√14/√14) = 75√14 / 56.\n\nSo, R = 75√14 / 56.\n\nHmm, that's the circumradius. Not sure if I need that yet, but maybe.\n\nNext, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-tangent point. So, the lengths DB and DC are equal. Let me compute DB.\n\nThe length of the tangent from D to ω is DB = DC. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.\n\nBut I don't know DA or DP yet. Maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, there's a formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle. If I can find the distance from D to the center of ω, then DB = sqrt(OD² - R²), where O is the center. But I don't know where O is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me put point A at (0, 0), point B at (5, 0), since AB=5. Then, point C is somewhere in the plane. Given that AC=10 and BC=9, I can find the coordinates of C.\n\nLet me denote point C as (x, y). Then, distance from A to C is 10, so:\n\nx² + y² = 100.\n\nDistance from B to C is 9, so:\n\n(x - 5)² + y² = 81.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 5)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 81 - 100\n\nExpanding (x - 5)²: x² -10x +25 + y² - x² - y² = -19\n\nSimplify: -10x +25 = -19 => -10x = -44 => x = 4.4\n\nSo, x = 22/5. Then, plug back into x² + y² = 100:\n\n(22/5)² + y² = 100 => (484/25) + y² = 100 => y² = 100 - 484/25 = (2500 - 484)/25 = 2016/25 => y = sqrt(2016)/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(2016): 2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 14. So sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(14) = 12√14.\n\nThus, y = 12√14 / 5.\n\nSo, coordinates of C are (22/5, 12√14/5).\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (0, 0)\n\nB: (5, 0)\n\nC: (22/5, 12√14/5)\n\nNow, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since it passes through A, B, and C.\n\nWe can find the circumcircle equation using the coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince A(0,0) is on the circle: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(5,0):\n\n25 + 0 + 5D + 0 = 0 => 25 + 5D = 0 => D = -5.\n\nSo, equation becomes x² + y² -5x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point C(22/5, 12√14/5):\n\n(22/5)² + (12√14/5)² -5*(22/5) + E*(12√14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(22/5)² = 484/25\n\n(12√14/5)² = (144 * 14)/25 = 2016/25\n\n-5*(22/5) = -22\n\nE*(12√14/5) = (12√14 E)/5\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n484/25 + 2016/25 -22 + (12√14 E)/5 = 0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(484 + 2016)/25 = 2500/25 = 100\n\nSo, 100 -22 + (12√14 E)/5 = 0 => 78 + (12√14 E)/5 = 0\n\nSolve for E:\n\n(12√14 E)/5 = -78 => E = (-78 * 5)/(12√14) = (-390)/(12√14) = (-65)/(2√14)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nE = (-65)/(2√14) * (√14/√14) = (-65√14)/28\n\nSo, the equation of the circle ω is:\n\nx² + y² -5x - (65√14)/28 y = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is given by:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula for the tangent to a circle at a point.\n\nYes, for a circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the tangent at (x1, y1) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nSo, let's apply this for point B(5, 0):\n\nTangent at B: x*5 + y*0 + (-5)(x + 5)/2 + (-65√14/28)(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n5x + 0 + (-5)(x + 5)/2 + (-65√14/28)(y)/2 = 0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5x - (5x +25)/2 - (65√14 y)/56 = 0\n\nMultiply through by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5x*56 - (5x +25)*28 - 65√14 y = 0\n\nCompute:\n\n280x - (140x + 700) -65√14 y = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n280x -140x -700 -65√14 y = 0 => 140x -700 -65√14 y = 0\n\nDivide through by 5:\n\n28x -140 -13√14 y = 0\n\nSo, 28x -13√14 y -140 = 0.\n\nThat's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at C(22/5, 12√14/5).\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nSo, x*(22/5) + y*(12√14/5) + (-5)(x + 22/5)/2 + (-65√14/28)(y + 12√14/5)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n(22/5)x + (12√14/5)y + (-5)(x + 22/5)/2 + (-65√14/28)(y + 12√14/5)/2 = 0.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst term: (22/5)x\n\nSecond term: (12√14/5)y\n\nThird term: (-5/2)(x + 22/5) = (-5/2)x - (5/2)(22/5) = (-5/2)x - 11\n\nFourth term: (-65√14/56)(y + 12√14/5) = (-65√14/56)y - (65√14/56)(12√14/5)\n\nSimplify the fourth term:\n\nFirst part: (-65√14/56)y\n\nSecond part: (-65√14 * 12√14)/(56*5) = (-65*12*14)/(56*5) because √14*√14=14.\n\nCompute numerator: 65*12=780, 780*14=10920\n\nDenominator: 56*5=280\n\nSo, second part: -10920/280 = -39.\n\nSo, fourth term becomes: (-65√14/56)y -39", "answer": "113"}

Aká je hodnota $m+n$?", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each vertex has two possibilities, and since they're independent, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out how many colorings allow the octagon to be rotated so that all blue vertices move to where the red ones were. That sounds a bit abstract. Let me think about what that means.\n\nIf we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices end up where red ones were, that implies that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue and red sets must be related by some rotation. Since the octagon is regular, it has rotational symmetry, so the number of possible rotations is 8 (including the identity rotation).\n\nWait, but not all colorings will satisfy this condition. So, I need to count the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.\n\nLet me consider that for a coloring to satisfy this condition, the blue vertices must form a set that is a rotation of the red vertices. So, if I have a certain number of blue vertices, say k, then the red vertices must also be k, and the blue set must be a rotation of the red set.\n\nBut wait, actually, the number of blue and red vertices must be the same because each blue vertex is moving to a red vertex. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Therefore, the number of blue vertices must be 4, since there are 8 vertices in total. So, only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices can satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, first, the total number of colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices is C(8,4) = 70. But not all of these 70 colorings will satisfy the rotation condition.\n\nSo, now I need to count how many of these 70 colorings have the property that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.\n\nWait, but if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set is also a rotation of the blue set. So, essentially, the blue and red sets are related by some rotation. So, the coloring must be such that the blue vertices form a set that can be rotated to the red vertices.\n\nBut how do I count such colorings?\n\nLet me think about the concept of rotational symmetry here. If the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the entire coloring must be symmetric under some rotation. That is, the coloring is fixed by that rotation.\n\nWait, no, not exactly. Because the blue set is being rotated to the red set, which is a different set. So, it's not that the coloring is fixed by the rotation, but rather that the blue set is mapped to the red set by some rotation.\n\nSo, perhaps another way to think about it is that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. So, the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which implies that the red set is also a rotation of the blue set.\n\nTherefore, the blue set must be a union of orbits under the rotation group of the octagon. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue set must be a rotationally symmetric set. But no, because the red set is just a rotation of the blue set, so the blue set doesn't have to be symmetric itself, just that it can be rotated to match the red set.\n\nWait, but if the blue set can be rotated to the red set, then the red set is just a rotated version of the blue set. So, the coloring is such that the blue and red sets are related by a rotation.\n\nSo, for each rotation, we can check if the blue set is equal to the red set rotated by that rotation.\n\nBut how do we count the number of such colorings?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as the blue set being a rotation of the red set, so the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. So, the coloring is determined by choosing a rotation and then coloring the vertices accordingly.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to overcount.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of group actions. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, generated by a rotation of 45 degrees. So, the group has 8 elements: rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°.\n\nFor a given coloring, the condition is that there exists some rotation (other than the identity, perhaps?) such that applying that rotation to the blue set gives the red set.\n\nBut actually, the identity rotation would just map blue to blue, so that's trivial. So, we need a non-identity rotation that maps blue to red.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"otočený tak, že všetky modré vrcholy skončia na miestach, kde boli pôvodne červené vrcholy.\" So, it's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to where the red ones were. So, the rotation must map the blue set exactly to the red set.\n\nSo, for a given coloring, if such a rotation exists, then the coloring is counted.\n\nSo, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.\n\nBut since the blue and red sets are complements of each other (since each vertex is either blue or red), the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of its own complement.\n\nSo, the blue set must be equal to the complement of its rotation by some angle.\n\nWait, that might be a key insight. So, if B is the set of blue vertices, then there exists a rotation r such that r(B) = R, where R is the set of red vertices. But since R is the complement of B, this means that r(B) = B^c.\n\nTherefore, r(B) = B^c.\n\nSo, applying rotation r twice, we get r(r(B)) = r(B^c) = (r(B))^c = (B^c)^c = B.\n\nSo, r^2(B) = B.\n\nTherefore, the set B is invariant under rotation r^2.\n\nSo, the set B must be fixed by rotation r^2.\n\nTherefore, B is a union of orbits under the rotation r^2.\n\nBut since the group is cyclic of order 8, the rotation r has order 8, so r^2 has order 4.\n\nTherefore, the orbits under r^2 are the cycles of length 4.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf r is a rotation by 45°, then r^2 is a rotation by 90°, which has order 4. So, the orbits under r^2 would partition the octagon into cycles of length 4.\n\nBut wait, 8 divided by 4 is 2, so actually, the orbits under r^2 would be two cycles of length 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a rotation by 90°, each orbit would consist of 4 vertices, but since 8 is divisible by 4, we have two orbits each of size 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a rotation by 90°, each orbit would consist of 4 vertices, but since 8 is divisible by 4, we have two orbits each of size 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a rotation by 90°, each orbit would consist of 4 vertices, but since 8 is

The functions given are a bit complicated, but let me try to break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the functions again to make sure I have them right:\n\n- \\( f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| \\)\n- \\( g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right| \\)\n\nAnd the two equations we're looking at are:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nSo, I need to find all points \\((x, y)\\) where these two equations are satisfied simultaneously. That means I need to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that both equations hold true.\n\nLet me start by understanding the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). Both are absolute value functions, which usually create V-shaped graphs. Let me sketch or visualize what \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) look like.\n\nFor \\(f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\):\n\n- The inner absolute value \\(|x|\\) makes the function symmetric about the y-axis.\n- Then, subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) shifts it down by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- Taking the absolute value again will reflect any negative parts back up.\n\nSo, \\(f(x)\\) will have a V-shape with its vertex at \\(x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\), right? Because when \\(|x| = \\frac{1}{2}\\), the expression inside the absolute value becomes zero, so that's the minimum point.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\):\n\n- The inner absolute value \\(|x|\\) again makes it symmetric.\n- Subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) shifts it down by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n- Taking the absolute value again reflects any negative parts.\n\nSo, \\(g(x)\\) will have its vertex at \\(x = \\pm \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the main functions:\n\n1. \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n2. \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nThese are both compositions of functions, so let me try to parse them.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\n- The innermost function is \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\). The sine function has a period of 1 because the argument is \\(2\\pi x\\), so it completes a full cycle every 1 unit in \\(x\\).\n- Then, we apply \\(f\\) to this sine function. So, \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\).\n- Next, we apply \\(g\\) to the result: \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) = \\left| |f(\\sin(2\\pi x))| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\).\n- Finally, we multiply by 4 to get \\(y\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\n- The innermost function is \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\). The cosine function has a period of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) because the argument is \\(3\\pi y\\), so it completes a full cycle every \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) units in \\(y\\).\n- Then, apply \\(f\\) to this cosine function: \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) = \\left| |\\cos(3\\pi y)| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\).\n- Apply \\(g\\) to the result: \\(g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) = \\left| |f(\\cos(3\\pi y))| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\).\n- Multiply by 4 to get \\(x\\).\n\nSo, both equations are transformations of sine and cosine functions, composed with these absolute value functions, scaled by 4.\n\nI think the key here is to analyze the ranges of these functions because the number of intersections will depend on how these functions behave over their domains.\n\nLet me first find the range of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\).\n\nFor \\(f(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right|\\):\n\n- The inner \\(|x|\\) is always non-negative.\n- Subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) can make it negative if \\(|x| < \\frac{1}{2}\\), so the absolute value will reflect that part.\n- So, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(|x| = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- The maximum value occurs as \\(|x|\\) increases beyond \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so \\(f(x)\\) can go up to infinity, but in our case, since we're applying it to sine and cosine functions, which are bounded between -1 and 1, the maximum value of \\(f\\) will be when \\(|x|\\) is 1, so \\(f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\\). So, the range of \\(f\\) when applied to sine or cosine is [0, 1/2].\n\nSimilarly, for \\(g(x) = \\left| |x| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|\\):\n\n- The inner \\(|x|\\) is non-negative.\n- Subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) can make it negative if \\(|x| < \\frac{1}{4}\\), so the absolute value reflects that.\n- The minimum value is 0 at \\(|x| = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n- The maximum value when \\(|x|\\) is 1 is \\(|1 - 1/4| = 3/4\\). So, the range of \\(g\\) when applied to the output of \\(f\\) (which is between 0 and 1/2) will be:\n\nSince \\(f\\) outputs between 0 and 1/2, then \\(g(f(x)) = |f(x) - 1/4|\\). So, when \\(f(x)\\) is 0, \\(g(0) = 1/4\\). When \\(f(x)\\) is 1/2, \\(g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4. Wait, that's interesting. So, actually, the maximum of \\(g(f(x))\\) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is in [0, 1/2], then \\(g(f(x)) = |f(x) - 1/4|\\). So, when \\(f(x) = 1/4\\), \\(g(f(x)) = 0\\). When \\(f(x)\\) is 0, \\(g(f(x)) = 1/4\\). When \\(f(x)\\) is 1/2, \\(g(f(x)) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4. So, actually, the range of \\(g(f(x))\\) is [0, 1/4].\n\nTherefore, when we multiply by 4, the range of \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) is [0, 1]. Similarly, the range of \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\) is [0, 1].\n\nSo, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are confined between 0 and 1 in these equations.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information because it tells me that any intersection points must lie within the square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nNow, let me think about the periodicity of these functions.\n\nFor the first equation, \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\):\n\n- The sine function has a period of 1, so as \\(x\\) increases by 1, the sine function repeats.\n- However, since we're dealing with \\(x\\) in [0,1], the function is periodic with period 1, so we can focus on \\(x\\) in [0,1].\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\):\n\n- The cosine function has a period of \\(2/(3\\pi)\\) in terms of \\(y\\), but since we're dealing with \\(y\\) in [0,1], let's see how many periods fit into [0,1].\n\nThe period \\(T\\) of \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\) is \\(2\\pi / (3\\pi) = 2/3\\). So, in the interval [0,1], there are 1.5 periods. So, the function will repeat every 2/3 units in \\(y\\).\n\nBut since we're dealing with \\(y\\) in [0,1], the function will have 1.5 cycles.\n\nThis suggests that both functions are periodic within the interval [0,1], but with different periods.\n\nGiven that, the number of intersection points might be related to the number of times these two functions cross each other within the unit square.\n\nBut since both functions are compositions of periodic functions, it's likely that they have multiple intersection points.\n\nTo find the exact number, I might need to analyze the behavior of each function in more detail.\n\nLet me first analyze \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\).\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Start with \\(\\sin(2\\pi x)\\). For \\(x\\) in [0,1], this is a sine wave that starts at 0, goes up to 1 at \\(x = 1/4\\), back to 0 at \\(x = 1/2\\), down to -1 at \\(x = 3/4\\), and back to 0 at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n2. Then, apply \\(f\\) to this: \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - 1/2 \\right|\\).\n\nLet me consider \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\), which is a full-wave rectified sine wave, oscillating between 0 and 1 with period 1/2.\n\nSo, \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = \\left| |\\sin(2\\pi x)| - 1/2 \\right|\\).\n\nThis will create a function that is the absolute difference between \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) and 1/2.\n\nSo, when \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1/2\\), \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = 0\\). When \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) is 0 or 1, \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) is 1/2 or 1/2, respectively.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute:\n\n- When \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1/2\\), then \\(f = 0\\).\n- When \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 0\\), \\(f = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2\\).\n- When \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = 1\\), \\(f = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\\).\n\nSo, the function \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with peaks at 1/2 when \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) is 0 or 1, and zeros when \\(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|\\) is 1/2.\n\nSo, the graph of \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) will have a \"W\" shape in each period, with minima at 0 and maxima at 1/2.\n\nNow, applying \\(g\\) to this: \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) = \\left| f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) - 1/4 \\right|\\).\n\nSo, this is the absolute difference between \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) and 1/4.\n\nGiven that \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) ranges from 0 to 1/2, \\(g\\) will take this and create a function that is 0 when \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = 1/4\\), and peaks at 1/4 when \\(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))\\) is 0 or 1/2.\n\nSo, \\(g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) will oscillate between 0 and 1/4.\n\nMultiplying by 4, we get \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\), which will oscillate between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\):\n\n1. Start with \\(\\cos(3\\pi y)\\). For \\(y\\) in [0,1], this function has a period of \\(2/3\\), so it completes 1.5 cycles in [0,1].\n\n2. The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, but since we take the absolute value in \\(f\\), it becomes \\(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|\\), which oscillates between 0 and 1.\n\n3. Then, \\(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) = \\left| |\\cos(3\\pi y)| - 1/2 \\right|\\). Similar to the previous case, this will oscillate between 0 and 1/2.\n\n4. Then, \\(g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) = \\left| f(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - 1/4 \\right|\\), which oscillates between 0 and 1/4.\n\n5. Multiplying by 4, we get \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\), which oscillates between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are confined between 0 and 1, and both functions are oscillatory with different periods.\n\nNow, to find the number of intersection points, I need to find how many times the graph of \\(y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))\\) intersects with the graph of \\(x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))\\) within the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nThis seems a bit tricky because both functions are periodic and oscill", "answer": "385"}

Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. So, maybe I should start by checking these small primes to see if any of them satisfy the condition that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p² for some n.\n\nLet me start with p = 2. Then p² = 4. I need to check if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for different n:\n\n- If n is even, say n = 2k, then n⁴ = (2k)⁴ = 16k⁴, which is 0 mod 4. So n⁴ + 1 would be 1 mod 4, which is not divisible by 4.\n- If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then n⁴ = (2k + 1)⁴. Let's compute this modulo 4. (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, squaring that, (1)² = 1 mod 4. So n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4, and n⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which is also not divisible by 4.\n\nSo, for p = 2, there's no n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, p cannot be 2.\n\nNext, let's try p = 3. Then p² = 9. I need to find an n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers):\n\n- n = 1: 1⁴ = 1 → 1 + 1 = 2 mod 9\n- n = 2: 16 → 16 mod 9 = 7 → 7 + 1 = 8 mod 9\n- n = 3: 81 → 0 mod 9 → 0 + 1 = 1 mod 9\n- n = 4: 256 → 256 mod 9: 256 ÷ 9 = 28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4 + 1 = 5 mod 9\n- n = 5: 625 → 625 mod 9: 625 ÷ 9 = 69*9=621, 625-621=4 → 4 + 1 = 5 mod 9\n- n = 6: 1296 → 0 mod 9 → 0 + 1 = 1 mod 9\n- n = 7: 2401 → 2401 mod 9: 2401 ÷ 9 = 266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7 → 7 + 1 = 8 mod 9\n- n = 8: 4096 → 4096 mod 9: 4096 ÷ 9 = 455*9=4095, 4096-4095=1 → 1 + 1 = 2 mod 9\n\nHmm, none of these give 0 mod 9. So, n⁴ + 1 is never divisible by 9. Therefore, p cannot be 3 either.\n\nMoving on to p = 5. Then p² = 25. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 25. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24:\n\nBut that's a lot of numbers. Maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that in modular arithmetic, exponents can sometimes be simplified using Euler's theorem or Fermat's little theorem. Since 25 is 5², Euler's theorem tells us that for n coprime to 25, n^φ(25) ≡ 1 mod 25, where φ(25) = 20. So, n^20 ≡ 1 mod 25. Therefore, n^4 would have an order dividing 5, since 20 / 4 = 5. So, n^4 could be 1, 6, 11, 16, or 21 mod 25? Wait, not sure. Maybe I should compute n^4 mod 25 for n from 1 to 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's try some numbers:\n\nn = 2: 16 → 16 + 1 = 17 mod 25\nn = 3: 81 → 6 mod 25 → 6 + 1 = 7\nn = 4: 256 → 6 mod 25 → 6 + 1 = 7\nn = 7: 7⁴ = 49² = 2401 → 2401 mod 25: 2400 is divisible by 25, so 2401 ≡ 1 mod 25. So 1 + 1 = 2 mod 25\nn = 8: 8⁴ = 4096 → 4096 mod 25: 4096 - 25*163 = 4096 - 4075 = 21 → 21 + 1 = 22 mod 25\nn = 12: 12⁴ = (12²)² = 144². 144 mod 25 is 19, so 19² = 361 mod 25 is 11. So 11 + 1 = 12 mod 25\nn = 13: 13⁴ = (13²)² = 169². 169 mod 25 is 19, so 19² = 361 mod 25 is 11. 11 + 1 = 12 mod 25\nn = 17: 17 mod 25 is 17, 17² = 289 mod 25 is 14, 14² = 196 mod 25 is 21. So 21 + 1 = 22 mod 25\nn = 18: 18² = 324 mod 25 is 24, 24² = 576 mod 25 is 1. So 1 + 1 = 2 mod 25\nn = 22: 22 mod 25 is 22, 22² = 484 mod 25 is 9, 9² = 81 mod 25 is 6. 6 + 1 = 7 mod 25\nn = 23: 23 mod 25 is 23, 23² = 529 mod 25 is 4, 4² = 16. 16 + 1 = 17 mod 25\n\nHmm, none of these give 0 mod 25. Wait, maybe I missed some numbers. Let me try n = 1: 1 + 1 = 2 mod 25. n = 5: 5⁴ = 625 ≡ 0 mod 25, so 0 + 1 = 1 mod 25. n = 10: 10⁴ = 10000 ≡ 0 mod 25, so 0 + 1 = 1 mod 25. n = 15: same as 10, 15⁴ ≡ 0 mod 25, so 1 mod 25. n = 20: same, 20⁴ ≡ 0 mod 25, so 1 mod 25.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check n = 7: 7⁴ = 2401 ≡ 1 mod 25, so 1 + 1 = 2. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe n = 12: 12⁴ = 20736. 20736 ÷ 25: 25*829 = 20725, so 20736 - 20725 = 11. So 11 + 1 = 12 mod 25.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not finding any n where n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 25. So perhaps p = 5 is also not suitable.\n\nWait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me check n = 7 again: 7² = 49, 49 mod 25 is 24, which is -1 mod 25. So 7² ≡ -1 mod 25. Then, 7⁴ = (7²)² ≡ (-1)² = 1 mod 25. So 7⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 25. So that's not 0.\n\nWait, but if 7² ≡ -1 mod 25, then 7⁴ ≡ 1 mod 25, so 7⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 25. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe n = 18: 18² = 324 ≡ 24 mod 25, which is -1. So 18² ≡ -1 mod 25, so 18⁴ ≡ 1 mod 25, so 18⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 25. Same as before.\n\nHmm, so maybe p = 5 doesn't work either. Let me try p = 7. Then p² = 49. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 49.\n\nAgain, maybe I can use some properties. Since 49 is 7², Euler's totient function φ(49) = 42. So for n coprime to 49, n^42 ≡ 1 mod 49. So n^4 would have an order dividing 42/ gcd(4,42) = 42/2 = 21. So the order of n^4 mod 49 divides 21. So, n^4 could be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 21 mod 49. But we need n^4 ≡ -1 mod 49.\n\nWait, does -1 exist as a quartic residue mod 49? I'm not sure. Let me try some numbers.\n\nn = 2: 16 + 1 = 17 mod 49\nn = 3: 81 + 1 = 82 mod 49: 82 - 49 = 33\nn = 4: 256 + 1 = 257 mod 49: 49*5=245, 257-245=12\nn = 5: 625 + 1 = 626 mod 49: 49*12=588, 626-588=38\nn = 6: 1296 + 1 = 1297 mod 49: 49*26=1274, 1297-1274=23\nn = 7: 0 + 1 = 1 mod 49\nn = 8: 4096 + 1 = 4097 mod 49: Let's compute 49*83=4067, 4097-4067=30\nn = 9: 6561 + 1 = 6562 mod 49: 49*133=6517, 6562-6517=45\nn = 10: 10000 + 1 = 10001 mod 49: Let's see, 49*204=9996, 10001-9996=5\nn = 11: 14641 + 1 = 14642 mod 49: 49*298=14502, 14642-14502=140, 140 mod 49: 140 - 2*49=42\nn = 12: 12⁴=20736 +1=20737 mod 49: Let's compute 49*423=20727, 20737-20727=10\nn = 13: 13⁴=28561 +1=28562 mod 49: 49*582=28518, 28562-28518=44\nn = 14: 14⁴=38416 +1=38417 mod 49: 49*784=38416, so 38417 ≡ 1 mod 49\nn = 15:", "answer": "110"}

Nájdite $m+n+p$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The distance is given in the form m√n/p, and I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = √41\n- AC = BD = √80\n- BC = AD = √89\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges has the same length. That seems symmetrical. Maybe this tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry? I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or sometimes a disphenoid. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which might help in calculations.\n\nNow, the point I is inside the tetrahedron such that its distances to all four faces are equal. That sounds like the incenter of the tetrahedron. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and this distance is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I recall that the formula is similar to the 2D case. In a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V / S.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume V = √[ (CM) / 288 ], where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |\n| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |\n| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |\n| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant.\n\nLet me assign the edges:\n\nAB = √41, so a = √41, a² = 41\n\nAC = √80, so b = √80, b² = 80\n\nAD = √89, so c = √89, c² = 89\n\nBC = √89, so d = √89, d² = 89\n\nBD = √80, so e = √80, e² = 80\n\nCD = √41, so f = √41, f² = 41\n\nSo, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, the determinant CM is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41   80   89 |\n| 1  41   0    89   80 |\n| 1  80  89    0    41 |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nCalculating this determinant seems a bit involved, but maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric across the main diagonal, which is good. Maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, which might have a simpler volume formula.\n\nWait, for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * √( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / (6*sqrt(2))\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by considering the coordinates of the tetrahedron.\n\nSince the edge lengths are symmetric, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that calculations are easier.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the vertices:\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me place vertex B at (x, 0, 0).\n\nVertex C at (p, q, 0).\n\nVertex D at (r, s, t).\n\nThen, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nGiven AB = √41, so distance from A(0,0,0) to B(x,0,0) is x = √41, so x = √41.\n\nSo, B is at (√41, 0, 0).\n\nNow, AC = √80, so distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is √(p² + q²) = √80, so p² + q² = 80.\n\nSimilarly, AD = √89, so distance from A(0,0,0) to D(r, s, t) is √(r² + s² + t²) = √89, so r² + s² + t² = 89.\n\nNow, BC = √89, so distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is √( (p - √41)² + q² ) = √89.\n\nSo, (p - √41)² + q² = 89.\n\nBut we know p² + q² = 80, so expanding (p - √41)² + q²:\n\np² - 2p√41 + 41 + q² = 89\n\nBut p² + q² = 80, so substituting:\n\n80 - 2p√41 + 41 = 89\n\nSo, 121 - 2p√41 = 89\n\nThus, -2p√41 = 89 - 121 = -32\n\nSo, 2p√41 = 32 => p√41 = 16 => p = 16 / √41\n\nRationalizing the denominator, p = (16√41)/41\n\nSo, p = 16√41 / 41\n\nNow, since p² + q² = 80, let's compute q²:\n\np² = (256 * 41) / (41²) = 256 / 41\n\nSo, q² = 80 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nThus, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 16 * 9 * 21\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12√21\n\nThus, q = 12√21 / √41 = (12√21√41)/41 = 12√861 / 41\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, 3024 divided by 41 is 73.756... Hmm, maybe I should keep it as 3024/41 for now.\n\nWait, 3024 divided by 41: 41*73 = 3000 + 41*73= 41*(70+3)= 2870 + 123= 2993. So, 3024 - 2993=31. So, 3024=41*73 +31, so 3024/41=73 +31/41. Hmm, not a perfect square. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate p²:\n\np = 16√41 /41, so p² = (256 *41)/ (41²) = 256 /41. Correct.\n\nThen, q² = 80 -256/41 = (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41= 3024/41. Correct.\n\nSo, q²=3024/41, which is approximately 73.756, but not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I need to keep it as is.\n\nSo, point C is at (16√41/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, moving on to point D(r, s, t). We know AD = √89, so r² + s² + t² =89.\n\nAlso, BD = √80, so distance from B(√41,0,0) to D(r,s,t) is √( (r -√41)^2 + s² + t² )=√80.\n\nSo, (r -√41)^2 + s² + t² =80.\n\nBut we know r² + s² + t²=89, so expanding (r -√41)^2 + s² + t²:\n\nr² - 2r√41 +41 + s² + t²=80\n\nBut r² + s² + t²=89, so substituting:\n\n89 -2r√41 +41=80\n\nSo, 130 -2r√41=80\n\nThus, -2r√41= -50 => 2r√41=50 => r√41=25 => r=25/√41=25√41/41\n\nSo, r=25√41/41\n\nNow, since r² + s² + t²=89, let's compute r²:\n\nr²=(625*41)/(41²)=625/41\n\nSo, s² + t²=89 -625/41= (89*41 -625)/41= (3649 -625)/41=3024/41\n\nSo, s² + t²=3024/41\n\nHmm, same as q² earlier. Interesting.\n\nNow, we also have CD=√41, so distance from C(p, q, 0) to D(r, s, t) is √( (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 + t² )=√41\n\nSo, (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 + t²=41\n\nWe know r=25√41/41, p=16√41/41, so r - p= (25√41 -16√41)/41=9√41/41\n\nSo, (r - p)^2= (81*41)/ (41²)=81/41\n\nSimilarly, (s - q)^2 + t²=41 -81/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41\n\nSo, (s - q)^2 + t²=1600/41\n\nBut we also know that s² + t²=3024/41\n\nSo, let's write:\n\n(s - q)^2 + t²=1600/41\n\nBut s² + t²=3024/41\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(s - q)^2 + t² - (s² + t²)=1600/41 -3024/41\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2sq + q²= (1600 -3024)/41= (-1424)/41= -34.731...\n\nWait, let's compute it exactly:\n\n1600 -3024= -1424\n\nSo, -2sq + q²= -1424/41\n\nBut we know q²=3024/41, so:\n\n-2sq +3024/41= -1424/41\n\nThus, -2sq= (-1424 -3024)/41= (-4448)/41\n\nSo, -2sq= -4448/41 => 2sq=4448/41 => sq=2224/41\n\nSo, s*q=2224/41\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but let's note that", "answer": "104"}

Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box, the surface area (S) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. So, for each box in set B, we have:\n\n2(lw + lh + wh) = 54  \nlwh = 23\n\nI need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4.\n\nSo, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (l² + w² + h²)/4. But since all boxes in B have the same surface area and volume, I need to find the minimum possible value of (l² + w² + h²) given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.\n\nLet me denote the variables as x, y, z for simplicity. So, x, y, z are positive real numbers such that:\n\n2(xy + xz + yz) = 54  \nxyz = 23\n\nI need to find the minimum of (x² + y² + z²)/4.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I have two equations and I need to find the minimum of another expression. This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers, but since it's symmetric, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints. I remember that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + xz + yz). So, if I can find x + y + z, I can find x² + y² + z².\n\nGiven that 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54, so (xy + xz + yz) = 27. Therefore, (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54. So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54.\n\nSo, if I can find x + y + z, then I can find x² + y² + z².\n\nBut how? I also know that xyz = 23. So, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality or something similar.\n\nWait, but AM ≥ GM applies to positive numbers, which x, y, z are. So, the arithmetic mean of x, y, z is (x + y + z)/3, and the geometric mean is (xyz)^(1/3) = (23)^(1/3). So, AM ≥ GM implies that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). Therefore, x + y + z ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3). But I don't know if this helps me directly because I need the exact value, not just a lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of variables that can be optimized. Let me consider using Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².\n\nSubject to the constraints:\ng(x, y, z) = 2(xy + xz + yz) - 54 = 0  \nh(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0\n\nSo, I can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + xz + yz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)\n\nThen, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them to zero.\n\nCompute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0  \nSimilarly, ∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0  \n∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\n2(xy + xz + yz) = 54  \nxyz = 23\n\nSo, from the partial derivatives, we have:\n\n2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0  \n2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0  \n2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate some variables.\n\nSubtracting first from second:\n\n2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ(xz) - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2y - 2λx - 2λz - μxz - 2x + 2λy + 2λz + μyz = 0  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(2y - 2x) + (-2λx + 2λy) + (-μxz + μyz) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(y - x) + 2λ(y - x) + μz(y - x) = 0  \nFactor out (y - x):\n\n(y - x)(2 + 2λ + μz) = 0\n\nSo, either y = x or 2 + 2λ + μz = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the second equation from the third:\n\n2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy - [2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2z - 2λx - 2λy - μxy - 2y + 2λx + 2λz + μxz = 0  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(2z - 2y) + (-2λy + 2λz) + (-μxy + μxz) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(z - y) + 2λ(z - y) + μx(z - y) = 0  \nFactor out (z - y):\n\n(z - y)(2 + 2λ + μx) = 0\n\nSo, either z = y or 2 + 2λ + μx = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the first equation from the third:\n\n2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz] = 0  \nSimplify:\n\n2z - 2λx - 2λy - μxy - 2x + 2λy + 2λz + μyz = 0  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(2z - 2x) + (-2λx + 2λz) + (-μxy + μyz) = 0  \nFactor:\n\n2(z - x) + 2λ(z - x) + μy(z - x) = 0  \nFactor out (z - x):\n\n(z - x)(2 + 2λ + μy) = 0\n\nSo, either z = x or 2 + 2λ + μy = 0.\n\nSo, from these three results, we have possibilities:\n\nCase 1: All variables are equal, i.e., x = y = z.\n\nCase 2: Two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nCase 3: All variables are different, but the other factors are zero.\n\nBut let's consider Case 1 first: x = y = z.\n\nIf x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's see if this satisfies the constraints.\n\nSurface area: 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3.\n\nVolume: x³ = 27. But the volume is supposed to be 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, which is more than 23. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube, but perhaps a different box.\n\nSo, Case 1 is not possible because the volume would be too large. Therefore, we need to consider Case 2: two variables equal, third different.\n\nLet me assume x = y ≠ z.\n\nSo, let x = y, then we have:\n\nSurface area: 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 => 2x² + 4xz = 54 => x² + 2xz = 27.\n\nVolume: x²z = 23.\n\nSo, from volume, z = 23/(x²). Substitute into surface area equation:\n\nx² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27  \nSimplify:\n\nx² + (46)/x = 27  \nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx³ + 46 = 27x  \nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx³ - 27x + 46 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation. Let me try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.\n\nTest x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0  \nx=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (x - 2):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2):\n\nCoefficients: 1, 0, -27, 46\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next term: 0 +2=2. Multiply by 2:4. Add to -27: -23. Multiply by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, quotient is x² + 2x -23.\n\nThus, x³ -27x +46 = (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23). Now, set equal to zero:\n\n(x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0\n\nSo, x=2 or x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)\n\nSince x must be positive, x=2 or x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's compute -1 + 2*sqrt(6):\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so 2*sqrt(6) ≈4.898, so -1 +4.898≈3.898. So, x≈3.898.\n\nSo, possible x values are 2 and approximately 3.898.\n\nSo, let's check x=2:\n\nIf x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.\n\nSo, the box would be 2x2x5.75.\n\nCompute x² + y² + z² = 2² + 2² + (23/4)² = 4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +33.0625=41.0625.\n\nAlternatively, x≈3.898, so z=23/(3.898²). Let's compute 3.898²≈15.19, so z≈23/15.19≈1.515.\n\nCompute x² + y² + z²≈2*(3.898²) + (1.515)²≈2*15.19 +2.295≈30.38 +2.295≈32.675.\n\nSo, 32.675 is less than 41.0625, so the minimal x² + y² + z² is approximately 32.675 when x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.515.\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\nWe have x = -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me compute x²:\n\nx = -1 + 2√6  \nx² = (-1 + 2√6)² = 1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6\n\nSimilarly, z=23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):\n\nz=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25 -4√6)(25 +4√6)] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529= (23/529)*(25 +4√6)= (1/23)*(25 +4√6)\n\nSo, z= (25 +4√6)/23\n\nNow, compute x² + y² + z²=2x² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + [(25 +4√6)/23]^2\n\nCompute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6\n\nCompute [(25 +4√6)/23]^2:\n\nFirst, square numerator: (25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6\n\nSo, [(25 +4√6)/23]^2=(721 +200√6)/529\n\nTherefore, x² + y² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529\n\nConvert 50 to 50*529/52", "answer": "721"}

Nájdite $xy$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithmic identities to simplify these equations. Let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. log_x(y^x) = 10\n2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\n\nI think I can use the power rule for logarithms, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that to both equations:\n\nFor the first equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.\n\nOkay, so now I have:\n\n1. x * log_x(y) = 10\n2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10\n\nHmm, I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). That might be useful here because I see log_x(y) and log_y(x) in the equations. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let’s set a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a because of the reciprocal property.\n\nSo substituting back into the equations:\n\n1. x * a = 10\n2. 4y * (1/a) = 10\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x * a = 10\n2. (4y)/a = 10\n\nI can solve these equations for x and y in terms of a. From the first equation, x = 10 / a. From the second equation, 4y = 10a, so y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.\n\nSo now I have expressions for x and y in terms of a:\n\nx = 10 / a\n\ny = (5a)/2\n\nBut I also know that a = log_x(y). Let me write that down:\n\na = log_x(y)\n\nBut since I have x and y in terms of a, I can substitute those into this equation. So:\n\na = log_{10/a} (5a/2)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can use the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula says that log_b(c) = ln(c) / ln(b). So, applying that here:\n\na = ln(5a/2) / ln(10/a)\n\nSo, a = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write it as:\n\na * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)\n\nLet me expand both sides. First, the left side:\n\na * ln(10/a) = a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = a ln(10) - a ln(a)\n\nThe right side is:\n\nln(5a/2) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\na ln(10) - a ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\na ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0\n\nFactor out the ln(a) terms:\n\na ln(10) - (a + 1) ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0\n\nHmm, this is a transcendental equation in terms of a, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can make a substitution or find a clever way to solve for a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of exponents. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: since I have x and y in terms of a, maybe I can express the relationship between x and y and find another equation.\n\nFrom earlier, x = 10/a and y = 5a/2. So, let's compute xy:\n\nxy = (10/a) * (5a/2) = (10 * 5a) / (2a) = 50a / 2a = 25\n\nWait, that's interesting. The a cancels out, and I get xy = 25. So, is that the answer? Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this is consistent with the original equations. Let me verify.\n\nIf xy = 25, then x = 25/y. Let me substitute back into the expressions for x and y in terms of a.\n\nFrom earlier, x = 10/a and y = 5a/2. So, x = 10/a, y = 5a/2, so xy = (10/a)(5a/2) = 25, which is consistent.\n\nBut I should also check if the value of a satisfies the equation a = log_x(y). Let me see.\n\nSince x = 10/a and y = 5a/2, then log_x(y) = log_{10/a}(5a/2). Let me compute this.\n\nUsing the change of base formula again:\n\nlog_{10/a}(5a/2) = ln(5a/2) / ln(10/a)\n\nBut from earlier, we had a = ln(5a/2) / ln(10/a), so this implies that a = log_x(y), which is consistent.\n\nWait, but does this mean that a can be any value? Or is there a specific value of a that satisfies this equation?\n\nWait, but in the process above, when I expressed xy, it turned out to be 25 regardless of a. So, does that mean that regardless of the value of a, as long as x and y satisfy the given logarithmic equations, their product is 25?\n\nBut let me think again. If I have x = 10/a and y = 5a/2, then regardless of a, their product is 25. So, maybe the answer is 25.\n\nBut let me test with specific numbers to see if this works.\n\nSuppose a = 2. Then x = 10/2 = 5, y = 5*2/2 = 5. So, x = 5, y = 5.\n\nCheck the first equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, but it should be 10. So that doesn't work. Hmm, so a = 2 is not a solution.\n\nWait, so my earlier conclusion that xy = 25 might be correct, but I need to ensure that a is such that the original equations hold.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that a can be any value. Let me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\na = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\na = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]\n\nLet me let’s set t = a, so:\n\nt = [ln(5t/2)] / [ln(10/t)]\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\nt * ln(10/t) = ln(5t/2)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt [ln(10) - ln(t)] = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nt ln(10) - t ln(t) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\nt ln(10) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0\n\nFactor terms with ln(t):\n\nt ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0\n\nThis is a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can solve it numerically or see if there's a clever substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that a is a simple number, like 2 or 5, and see if it works.\n\nWait, earlier when I tried a = 2, it didn't work because log_5(5^5) = 5, not 10. So a = 2 is not a solution.\n\nLet me try a = 5.\n\nIf a = 5, then x = 10/5 = 2, y = 5*5/2 = 12.5.\n\nCheck the first equation: log_2(12.5^2) = log_2(156.25). Let me compute log base 2 of 156.25.\n\n2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256. So log2(156.25) is between 7 and 8. Let me compute it more precisely.\n\n156.25 / 128 = 1.222705075. So log2(1.222705075) ≈ 0.2925. So total log2(156.25) ≈ 7.2925, which is not 10. So a = 5 is not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe a = 10.\n\nIf a = 10, then x = 10/10 = 1, but x must be greater than 1, so that's invalid.\n\nWait, maybe a = 1. Let's see, but a = log_x(y). If a = 1, then log_x(y) = 1, so y = x. Then, from x * 1 = 10, so x = 10, y = 10. Then, check the second equation: log_10(10^{4*10}) = log_10(10^{40}) = 40, which is not 10. So a = 1 is not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe a = sqrt(10). Let me try a = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623.\n\nThen x = 10 / 3.1623 ≈ 3.1623, y = 5*3.1623 / 2 ≈ 7.9058.\n\nCheck the first equation: log_x(y^x) = log_{3.1623}(7.9058^{3.1623}).\n\nCompute 7.9058^{3.1623}. Let me approximate:\n\n7.9058^3 ≈ 7.9058 * 7.9058 * 7.9058 ≈ 493.039.\n\n7.9058^0.1623 ≈ e^{0.1623 * ln(7.9058)} ≈ e^{0.1623 * 2.068} ≈ e^{0.335} ≈ 1.398.\n\nSo total ≈ 493.039 * 1.398 ≈ 690. So log_{3.1623}(690). Let me compute log base 3.1623 of 690.\n\n3.1623^5 ≈ (sqrt(10))^5 = 10^(5/2) = 10^2.5 = 316.23. 3.1623^6 ≈ 316.23 * 3.1623 ≈ 1000. So 3.1623^6 ≈ 1000, so log_{3.1623}(690) is between 5 and 6, closer to 6. So it's not 10. So a = sqrt(10) is not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom the first equation: x * log_x(y) = 10\n\nFrom the second equation: 4y * log_y(x) = 10\n\nWe can write log_x(y) as 10 / x, and log_y(x) as 10 / (4y)\n\nBut since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), we have:\n\n10 / x = 1 / (10 / (4y)) = 4y / 10\n\nSo:\n\n10 / x = 4y / 10\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n100 = 4xy\n\nSo, 4xy = 100 => xy = 25\n\nWait, that's the same result as before! So regardless of the value of a, as long as the equations hold, xy must be 25.\n\nSo, even though I couldn't find the exact value of a, the product xy is determined to be 25.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25.\n\nBut let me double-check this conclusion. If xy = 25, then y = 25 / x.\n\nSubstitute back into the first equation: log_x(y^x) = log_x((25/x)^x) = log_x(25^x / x^x) = log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x) = x log_x(25) - x log_x(x) = x log_x(25) - x * 1 = x log_x(25) - x\n\nBut log_x(25) = ln(25)/ln(x), so:\n\nx * (ln(25)/ln(x)) - x = (x ln(25))/ln(x) - x\n\nSet this equal to 10:\n\n(x ln(25))/ln(x) - x = 10\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\n\nBut y = 25/x, so:\n\nlog_{25/x}(x^{4*(25/x)}) = 10\n\nSimplify the exponent: 4*(25/x) = 100/x\n\nSo, log_{25/x}(x^{100/x}) = 10\n\nUsing the power rule:\n\n(100/x) * log_{25/x}(x) = 10\n\nBut log_{25/x}(x) = 1 / log_x(25/x) =", "answer": "25"}

They take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from the pile. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 are such that Bob has a winning strategy, meaning no matter how Alice plays, Bob can force a win.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, specifically a variant of the classic Nim game. In such games, positions can often be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, while a losing position means the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, in this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Let me try to model this. I'll denote a position as losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a position is winning if the current player can force a win.\n\nLet me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. So, n=1 is a losing position for Bob.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. But wait, if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because there are only 2 tokens. So, Alice has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. So, n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, because Alice is the one who starts. If n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, for n=2, Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: If n is a losing position, it means the current player cannot force a win. So, if n=1 is a losing position for the current player, because they have to take 1 and win. Wait, no, if n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins, so n=1 is a winning position. Hmm, maybe I need to redefine.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar. Let me try to list the positions from n=0 upwards and label them as winning (W) or losing (L).\n\nn=0: If there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player to move loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.\n\nn=1: The current player can take 1 and win. So, W.\n\nn=2: The current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can't take 4. So, the current player can only take 1, leaving 1, which is a W position for the opponent. So, n=2 is L? Wait, no, because if the current player takes 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent, meaning the opponent can win. So, n=2 is L for the current player? Wait, no, if the current player can force the opponent into a losing position, then n=2 would be W. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to define it properly. A position is losing if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. A position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, starting from n=0: L (no moves possible).\n\nn=1: Can take 1, leading to n=0 (L). So, n=1 is W.\n\nn=2: Can take 1, leading to n=1 (W). So, all moves lead to W, so n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Can take 1, leading to n=2 (L). So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Can take 1, leading to n=3 (W), or take 4, leading to n=0 (L). So, since taking 4 leads to L, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: Can take 1, leading to n=4 (W), or take 4, leading to n=1 (W). So, all moves lead to W, so n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Can take 1, leading to n=5 (L). So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Can take 1, leading to n=6 (W), or take 4, leading to n=3 (W). So, all moves lead to W, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Can take 1, leading to n=7 (L). So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Can take 1, leading to n=8 (W), or take 4, leading to n=5 (L). So, since taking 4 leads to L, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Can take 1, leading to n=9 (W), or take 4, leading to n=6 (W). So, all moves lead to W, so n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, let's see the pattern so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, that seems a bit irregular. Let me check again.\n\nWait, n=5: from n=5, taking 1 leads to n=4 (W), taking 4 leads to n=1 (W). So, both moves lead to W, so n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: taking 1 leads to n=5 (L), so n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: taking 1 leads to n=6 (W), taking 4 leads to n=3 (W). So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: taking 1 leads to n=7 (L), so n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: taking 1 leads to n=8 (W), taking 4 leads to n=5 (L). So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: taking 1 leads to n=9 (W), taking 4 leads to n=6 (W). So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: taking 1 leads to n=10 (L), so n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: taking 1 leads to n=11 (W), taking 4 leads to n=8 (W). So, n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: taking 1 leads to n=12 (L), so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: taking 1 leads to n=13 (W), taking 4 leads to n=10 (L). So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: taking 1 leads to n=14 (W), taking 4 leads to n=11 (W). So, n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: taking 1 leads to n=15 (L), so n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: taking 1 leads to n=16 (W), taking 4 leads to n=13 (W). So, n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: taking 1 leads to n=17 (L), so n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: taking 1 leads to n=18 (W), taking 4 leads to n=15 (L). So, n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: taking 1 leads to n=19 (W), taking 4 leads to n=16 (W). So, n=20 is L.\n\nHmm, so the losing positions seem to be at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the differences between these losing positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\n20-17=3\n\nSo, the pattern is alternating between adding 2 and 3. So, the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... and so on.\n\nSo, the losing positions follow the pattern where every two steps, you add 2 and then 3. So, starting from 0, add 2 to get 2, then add 3 to get 5, then add 2 to get 7, add 3 to get 10, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions can be described by the sequence where n ≡ 2 mod 5 and n ≡ 0 mod 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod 5 is 0, 7 mod 5 is 2, 10 mod 5 is 0, 12 mod 5 is 2, 15 mod 5 is 0, 17 mod 5 is 2, 20 mod 5 is 0, etc. So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 → L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 → L\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 → L\n\nn=7: 7 mod5=2 → L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 → L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 → L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 → L\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 → L\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 → L\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let me check n=25: 25 mod5=0 → L\n\nn=27:27 mod5=2 → L\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5, then it's a losing position for the current player. That means, if Alice starts at such an n, she cannot force a win, so Bob can win.\n\nTherefore, the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTotal numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5*404=2020, and 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers).\n\nSimilarly, numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024: Let's see, the first number is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.\n\nThe largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024 is 2022, since 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the count is 404 +1=405? Wait, no, because starting from 2, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nWait, but 2022=5*404 +2, so yes, 405 terms.\n\nWait, but 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, numbers ≡0 mod5: 404 numbers (from 5 to 2020, step 5).\n\nNumbers ≡2 mod5: 405 numbers (from 2 to 2022, step5).\n\nSo, total losing positions:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\nFor numbers ≡0 mod5: n=5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5=404.\n\nFor numbers ≡2 mod5: n=2,7,...,2022. The count is ((2022-2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, n=0 is also a losing position, but since n must be positive integers, n=0 is excluded. So, the count remains 809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024. 2024 mod5=2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2024≡4 mod5. So, 2024 is not a losing position.\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions ≤2024 is 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the pattern.\n\nFrom earlier, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So, every 5 numbers, starting at 0, then 2, then 5,7,10,12, etc.\n\nSo, in each block of 5 numbers, there are two losing positions: one at 0 mod5 and one at 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for numbers from 1 to 2024, how many complete blocks of 5 are there?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions, so 404*2=808.\n\nThen, the remaining 4 numbers (2021,2022,2023,20", "answer": "809"}

Nájdite $m+n$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nJen is participating in a lottery by choosing 4 different numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly drawn from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the drawn numbers. She wins the main prize if all four of her numbers are drawn. We need to find the probability that she wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the main prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the main prize automatically means she has won a prize, A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nFirst, let me figure out P(A), the probability of winning the main prize. That's the probability that all four of her numbers are drawn. Since the lottery draws 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is just 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that she has chosen. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).\n\nNext, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are drawn. This can be calculated by considering the different scenarios where she has exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers drawn. So, P(B) = P(exactly 2) + P(exactly 3) + P(exactly 4).\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract it from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which means she has fewer than two numbers drawn, i.e., 0 or 1 number drawn. So, P(not B) = P(0) + P(1). Then, P(B) = 1 - P(not B).\n\nI think calculating the complement might be simpler because it involves fewer terms. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, total possible combinations are 210.\n\nNow, P(not B) is the probability that 0 or 1 of her numbers are drawn.\n\nP(0): The number of ways to draw 4 numbers with none of her 4 numbers. That would be choosing all 4 from the remaining 6 numbers. So, C(6,4). Let me compute that: 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.\n\nP(1): The number of ways to draw exactly 1 of her numbers. That would be choosing 1 from her 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. So, C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20 = 80.\n\nTherefore, P(not B) = (15 + 80) / 210 = 95 / 210.\n\nSimplify that: 95 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 95 ÷ 5 = 19, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So, 19/42.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42.\n\nWait, hold on, 1 - 19/42 is 23/42? Let me check: 42 - 19 is 23, yes. So, P(B) = 23/42.\n\nNow, P(A) is the probability of winning the main prize, which is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.\n\nSo, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.\n\nDividing fractions: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5. Therefore, (1/5) / 23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.\n\nWait, that seems low. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, total combinations: C(10,4) = 210. Correct.\n\nP(not B): C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 15 + 80 = 95. So, 95/210 = 19/42. Correct.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42. Correct.\n\nP(A) = 1/210. Correct.\n\nSo, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/115. So, 1/115 is the probability.\n\nBut wait, 1/115 seems quite low. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me compute P(B) directly instead of using the complement.\n\nP(B) is the probability of at least 2 numbers matching. So, that's P(2) + P(3) + P(4).\n\nCompute each:\n\nP(2): C(4,2)*C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.\n\nP(3): C(4,3)*C(6,1). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.\n\nP(4): C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.\n\nSo, total favorable for B: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Simplify: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. That's the same as before. So, correct.\n\nSo, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/115.\n\nSo, 1/115 is the probability. So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1, so yes. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nWait, but 115 is 5*23, so 1 and 115 are coprime. So, yes, 1/115 is in simplest terms.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. Is there another way to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the conditional probability can be thought of as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes for A to the number of favorable outcomes for B.\n\nNumber of favorable for A: 1 (only one combination where all four are drawn).\n\nNumber of favorable for B: 115 (as computed above).\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}\n</think>\n\nJen is participating in a lottery by choosing 4 different numbers from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9, 10\\} \\).

The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.\n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, point D is one of its vertices, and point C is the opposite corner. So, the line DC is a side of the rectangle, which has length BC = 16. Wait, no, BC is the side adjacent to B and C, so BC is 16, which is the height of the rectangle, while AB is 107, which is the base.\n\nSo, rectangle ABCD has length AB = 107 and width BC = 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has length EF = 184 and width FG = 17.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, that means points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, the order is D-E-C-F on a straight line.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be useful for applying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nI need to find CE. So, CE is the segment between points C and E. Since C and E are both on the line D-E-C-F, CE is just the distance between C and E on that line.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is the length AB = 107. Then, since BC = 16, point B would be at (107, 16), and point A would be at (0, 16).\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Since points D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So, the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis. Therefore, points E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote point E as (e, 0) and point F as (f, 0). Since E and F are part of rectangle EFGH, which has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length along the x-axis from E to F, which is 184 units. So, the distance between E and F is 184. Since E is at (e,0) and F is at (f,0), then |f - e| = 184.\n\nAlso, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides FG and EH are both 17. So, from point F, moving up 17 units, we reach point G, and from point E, moving up 17 units, we reach point H. So, point G would be at (f, 17) and point H would be at (e, 17).\n\nNow, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me write down their coordinates:\n\n- A is at (0,16)\n- D is at (0,0)\n- H is at (e,17)\n- G is at (f,17)\n\nSo, these four points lie on a circle. To find the condition for four points being cyclic, we can use the property that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect at the center of the circle. Alternatively, we can use the cyclic quadrilateral condition that the product of the slopes of the diagonals is -1 if they are perpendicular, but that might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the power of a point or the cyclic quadrilateral condition that the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But since we have coordinates, maybe it's easier to use the general equation of a circle and plug in the points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Since points A, D, H, G lie on this circle, we can plug their coordinates into this equation to get a system of equations.\n\nLet's plug in point D (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0 + 256 + 0 + 32f = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.\n\nSo, now the equation is x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNext, plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne² + 289 + 2g e - 34 = 0 => e² + 2g e + 255 = 0. (Equation 1)\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G (f,17):\n\nf² + 289 + 2g f - 34 = 0 => f² + 2g f + 255 = 0. (Equation 2)\n\nSo, both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are equal to zero. Therefore, e² + 2g e + 255 = f² + 2g f + 255.\n\nSimplify: e² + 2g e = f² + 2g f.\n\nBring all terms to one side: e² - f² + 2g e - 2g f = 0.\n\nFactor: (e - f)(e + f) + 2g (e - f) = 0.\n\nFactor out (e - f): (e - f)(e + f + 2g) = 0.\n\nSo, either e - f = 0 or e + f + 2g = 0.\n\nBut e ≠ f because E and F are distinct points on the x-axis, so e - f ≠ 0. Therefore, e + f + 2g = 0 => g = -(e + f)/2.\n\nSo, we have g expressed in terms of e and f.\n\nNow, let's recall that EF = 184, which is the distance between E and F on the x-axis. So, |f - e| = 184. Since E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, I think E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C. Wait, but D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So, if E is between D and C, then e is between 0 and 107, and F is beyond C, so f = e + 184. But wait, if E is between D and C, then E is at (e,0) where 0 < e < 107, and F would be at (e + 184, 0). But then F would be at (e + 184, 0), which is way beyond C at (107,0). Alternatively, if E is to the left of D, then e would be negative, and F would be at e + 184, which could be on either side.\n\nWait, but the problem says points D, E, C, F are collinear in that order. So, the order is D-E-C-F. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, D is at (0,0), E is somewhere between D and C, so E is at (e,0) where 0 < e < 107, then C is at (107,0), and F is beyond C, so F is at (107 + (184 - (107 - e)), 0). Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, EF is 184, so the distance between E and F is 184. Since E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then the distance from E to F is 184. So, if E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0). But since C is at (107,0), and F is beyond C, then e + 184 > 107. So, e > 107 - 184 => e > -77. But since E is between D (0,0) and C (107,0), e must be between 0 and 107. So, e is between 0 and 107, and F is at (e + 184, 0), which is beyond C at (107,0). So, e + 184 > 107 => e > -77, which is always true since e > 0.\n\nSo, E is at (e,0), F is at (e + 184, 0). So, f = e + 184.\n\nSo, from earlier, we have g = -(e + f)/2 = -(e + (e + 184))/2 = -(2e + 184)/2 = -e - 92.\n\nSo, g = -e - 92.\n\nNow, let's go back to Equation 1: e² + 2g e + 255 = 0.\n\nSubstitute g = -e - 92 into Equation 1:\n\ne² + 2*(-e - 92)*e + 255 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\ne² - 2e² - 184e + 255 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-e² - 184e + 255 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ne² + 184e - 255 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in e:\n\ne² + 184e - 255 = 0\n\nLet's solve for e using the quadratic formula:\n\ne = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*1*255)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n184² = 33856\n\n4*1*255 = 1020\n\nSo, discriminant = 33856 + 1020 = 34876\n\nNow, sqrt(34876). Let's see, 184² is 33856, 185² is 34225, 186² is 34596, 187² is 34969. So, sqrt(34876) is between 186 and 187.\n\nLet me calculate 186² = 34596, so 34876 - 34596 = 280. So, sqrt(34876) = 186 + 280/(2*186) approximately, but maybe it's a whole number. Wait, 34876 divided by 4 is 8719, which is not a perfect square. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, 184² is 33856, 184*2=368, so 184² + 4*255 = 33856 + 1020 = 34876.\n\nWait, 34876 divided by 4 is 8719, which is not a perfect square. So, sqrt(34876) is not an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's double-check the equations.\n\nWe had:\n\nFrom point H (e,17):\n\ne² + 17² + 2g e - 16*17 = 0\n\nWait, 17² is 289, and 16*17 is 272.\n\nSo, e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 255, but that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the general equation after plugging in H (e,17):\n\ne² + (17)^2 + 2g e - 16*(17) = 0\n\nSo, e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e² + 2g e + 17 = 0. (Equation 1)\n\nSimilarly, for point G (f,17):\n\nf² + 289 + 2g f - 272 = 0 => f² + 2g f + 17 = 0. (Equation 2)\n\nSo, both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are e² + 2g e + 17 = 0 and f² + 2g f + 17 = 0.\n\nSo, subtracting them: e² - f² + 2g(e - f) = 0 => (e - f)(e + f + 2g) = 0.\n\nSince e ≠ f, then e + f + 2g = 0 => g = -(e + f)/2.\n\nWe also have EF = 184, so f = e + 184.\n\nSo, g = -(e + (e + 184))/2 = -(2e + 184)/2 = -e - 92.\n\nNow, plug g = -e -92 into Equation 1:\n\ne² + 2*(-e -9", "answer": "104"}

Nájdite počet takýchto ciest, ktoré zmenia smer presne štyrikrát, ako v príkladoch uvedených nižšie.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an 8x8 grid. These paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the bottom-left to the top-right corner usually requires moving 7 steps right and 7 steps up, totaling 14 steps. But wait, the problem mentions paths of length 16. That's two steps longer than the usual shortest path. So, does that mean the path is not the shortest? Maybe it's taking some detours or something.\n\nBut hold on, the grid is 8x8, so the coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). To get from (0,0) to (7,7), you need to move 7 right and 7 up, which is 14 moves. So a path of length 16 would mean taking two extra steps, which would involve moving back and forth, right? So, maybe the path goes right, then up, then right again, but then maybe left or down, creating some loops or something. But I need to make sure that the total number of right and up moves still sum up to 14, but with two extra moves that cancel each other out.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"ciest dĺžky 16\", which translates to \"paths of length 16\". So, each step is a move either right or up, but the total number of steps is 16. So, that would mean that instead of 14 steps, we have 16 steps. So, we have two extra steps. But since we need to end at (7,7), those two extra steps must be in opposite directions, effectively canceling each other out. So, for example, moving right and then left, or up and then down, which would bring us back to the same column or row.\n\nBut in that case, the path would have to include two such backtracking moves. So, the total number of right moves would be 7 + 1 = 8, and the number of left moves would be 1, so that 8 - 1 = 7. Similarly, for up and down moves, we would have 7 + 1 = 8 up moves and 1 down move, so 8 - 1 = 7. So, in total, the number of right moves is 8, left moves is 1, up moves is 8, and down moves is 1. So, total steps: 8 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 18. Wait, that's 18 steps, but the problem says 16. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path is allowed to move in any direction, not just right and up, but also left and down, but still ending at (7,7). So, the total displacement is 7 right and 7 up, but the total number of steps is 16. So, the number of right steps minus left steps equals 7, and the number of up steps minus down steps equals 7. Let me denote R as right, L as left, U as up, D as down. So, R - L = 7, U - D = 7. The total number of steps is R + L + U + D = 16.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. R - L = 7\n2. U - D = 7\n3. R + L + U + D = 16\n\nLet me solve these equations. From equation 1, R = L + 7. From equation 2, U = D + 7. Substitute into equation 3:\n\n(L + 7) + L + (D + 7) + D = 16\n2L + 2D + 14 = 16\n2L + 2D = 2\nL + D = 1\n\nSo, L and D are non-negative integers such that L + D = 1. So, possible cases:\n\nCase 1: L = 1, D = 0\nCase 2: L = 0, D = 1\n\nSo, for each case, we can find R and U.\n\nCase 1: L = 1, D = 0\nThen R = 1 + 7 = 8\nU = 0 + 7 = 7\nSo, R = 8, L = 1, U = 7, D = 0\n\nCase 2: L = 0, D = 1\nThen R = 0 + 7 = 7\nU = 1 + 7 = 8\nSo, R = 7, L = 0, U = 8, D = 1\n\nSo, in both cases, we have either 8 R, 1 L, 7 U, 0 D or 7 R, 0 L, 8 U, 1 D.\n\nSo, the total number of steps is 16 in both cases.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.\n\nWait, what does it mean to change direction? In a path, a direction change occurs when the direction of the next step is different from the previous one. So, for example, if you go right, right, up, that's a direction change from right to up. Similarly, right, up, right is also a direction change.\n\nBut in this case, since the path can go in four directions (right, left, up, down), the direction changes can be more complex. However, the problem is about changing direction exactly four times. So, the path must have exactly four points where the direction changes.\n\nWait, but in the usual grid paths where you only move right and up, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch from right to up or up to right. But in this case, since we can also move left and down, the direction changes can be more varied.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering direction changes as switching between horizontal and vertical moves, regardless of the specific direction. So, for example, moving right, then up is a direction change, moving up then right is also a direction change, moving right then left is a direction change, etc. So, any time the direction is not the same as the previous step, it's a direction change.\n\nBut the problem says \"zmenia smer presne štyrikrát\", which translates to \"change direction exactly four times\". So, the path must have exactly four direction changes.\n\nWait, but in the usual grid paths with only right and up moves, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch from right to up or up to right. For example, a path that goes all right then all up has only one direction change. A path that alternates right and up would have many direction changes.\n\nBut in this problem, since we can have left and down moves, the direction changes can be more complex. So, perhaps the problem is considering direction changes as switching between horizontal and vertical moves, regardless of the specific direction. So, moving right, then up is a direction change, moving up then right is also a direction change, moving right then left is a direction change, etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering direction changes as switching from right to up or up to right, but not considering left and down as separate directions. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is similar to the standard grid paths where you can only move right and up, but in this case, you can also move left and down, but the total displacement is still 7 right and 7 up. So, the path can meander, but ends at (7,7). And the direction changes are counted as the number of times the direction changes from right/up to up/right or something like that.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of it as the number of times the direction changes from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, regardless of the specific direction. So, for example, moving right, then up is a direction change, moving up then right is also a direction change, moving right then left is a direction change, moving left then up is a direction change, etc.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches between horizontal (right or left) and vertical (up or down). So, each time the path switches from horizontal to vertical or vertical to horizontal, that's a direction change.\n\nSo, for example, a path that goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up would have two direction changes: right to up, and up to right.\n\nWait, but in that case, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches between horizontal and vertical. So, if the path starts with a horizontal move, then switches to vertical, that's one change, then switches back to horizontal, that's two, etc.\n\nSo, in the problem, we need paths that have exactly four such direction changes.\n\nSo, the path starts with either a horizontal or vertical move, and then changes direction four times. So, the total number of segments (consecutive moves in the same direction) would be five, because each direction change starts a new segment.\n\nFor example, if you start with horizontal, then change to vertical, that's two segments, then change back to horizontal, that's three, etc. So, four direction changes would result in five segments.\n\nSo, the path is composed of five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical directions, starting with either horizontal or vertical.\n\nBut in our case, since the path can move left and down as well, the horizontal segments can be right or left, and vertical segments can be up or down.\n\nBut the total displacement must be 7 right and 7 up. So, the sum of all horizontal moves must be +7 (right) and the sum of all vertical moves must be +7 (up).\n\nSo, each horizontal segment can be a positive (right) or negative (left) move, and each vertical segment can be positive (up) or negative (down) move.\n\nBut the total sum of horizontal moves is 7, and the total sum of vertical moves is 7.\n\nSo, we have five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical. Let's consider two cases: starting with a horizontal segment or starting with a vertical segment.\n\nCase 1: Starting with a horizontal segment.\n\nSo, the path would be: H, V, H, V, H. So, three horizontal segments and two vertical segments.\n\nEach horizontal segment contributes some number of right or left moves, and each vertical segment contributes some number of up or down moves.\n\nThe total horizontal displacement is 7, so the sum of all horizontal moves is 7. Similarly, the total vertical displacement is 7.\n\nEach horizontal segment can be either right or left, and each vertical segment can be up or down.\n\nBut since we have three horizontal segments and two vertical segments, we need to assign directions to each segment such that the total displacement is 7 right and 7 up.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with a vertical segment.\n\nSo, the path would be: V, H, V, H, V. So, three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.\n\nAgain, each vertical segment can be up or down, and each horizontal segment can be right or left, with total displacements 7 right and 7 up.\n\nSo, let's tackle Case 1 first: starting with horizontal.\n\nWe have three horizontal segments (H1, H2, H3) and two vertical segments (V1, V2).\n\nEach H segment can be right or left, and each V segment can be up or down.\n\nThe sum of H1 + H2 + H3 = 7 (right is positive, left is negative).\n\nThe sum of V1 + V2 = 7 (up is positive, down is negative).\n\nEach segment must consist of at least one step, because otherwise, it wouldn't be a segment. So, each H segment has at least 1 step, and each V segment has at least 1 step.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the total number of steps is 16. So, the sum of all segment lengths is 16.\n\nIn Case 1: H1 + V1 + H2 + V2 + H3 = 16.\n\nBut H1, H2, H3 are the lengths of the horizontal segments, each at least 1, and V1, V2 are the lengths of the vertical segments, each at least 1.\n\nSo, the minimum total steps would be 3*1 + 2*1 = 5, but we have 16 steps, so the extra steps are 11.\n\nSo, we can model this as distributing the extra 11 steps among the 5 segments, with each segment getting zero or more extra steps.\n\nBut wait, no, because each segment must have at least 1 step, so we can model it as distributing 16 - 5 = 11 extra steps into 5 segments, each getting zero or more.\n\nBut actually, in this case, the horizontal segments are H1, H2, H3, each at least 1, and vertical segments V1, V2, each at least 1.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the steps is equivalent to the number of solutions to:\n\nH1 + H2 + H3 + V1 + V2 = 16, with H1, H2, H3 >=1, V1, V2 >=1.\n\nBut we also have the constraints on the displacements:\n\nH1 + H2 + H3 = 7 (but considering direction: H1, H2, H3 can be positive or negative, but their sum is 7)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The sum of the horizontal moves is 7, but each H segment can be right or left, so each H segment contributes either +k or -k, where k is the length of the segment.\n\nSimilarly, each V segment contributes either +m or -m, where m is the length of the segment.\n\nSo, the total horizontal displacement is H1_dir * H1 + H2_dir * H2 + H3_dir * H3 = 7\n\nSimilarly, total vertical displacement is V1_dir * V1 + V2_dir * V2 = 7\n\nWhere H1_dir, H2_dir, H3_dir are either +1 (right) or -1 (left)\n\nSimilarly, V1_dir, V2_dir are either +1 (up) or -1 (down)\n\nSo, this complicates things because each segment's direction affects the total displacement.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nFor Case 1: Starting with horizontal.\n\nWe have three horizontal segments and two vertical segments.\n\nEach horizontal segment can be right or left, and each vertical segment can be up or down.\n\nWe need the sum of horizontal moves to be 7, and the sum of vertical moves to be 7.\n\nEach segment has a length of at least 1.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nFor horizontal segments:\n\nLet H1, H2, H3 be the lengths, each >=1.\n\nLet d1, d2, d3 be the directions", "answer": "294"}

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(z\\) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. That might make things easier. Let me write \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\). That way, I can express everything in terms of \\(\\theta\\) and then maybe take the derivative to find the maximum.\n\nSo, substituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) into the expression, let's see:\n\nThe first term is \\((75 + 117i)z\\). Substituting \\(z\\), that becomes \\((75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta}\\). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants: 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So, it's \\(300 + 468i\\) multiplied by \\(e^{i\\theta}\\). Hmm, but actually, I should think of it as multiplying two complex numbers. So, \\((75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta}\\) is the same as \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\). Since \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), this becomes \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} = \\frac{24 + 36i}{e^{i\\theta}}\\). Which is the same as \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it. Let me compute the real part of each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's compute \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta}\\). Let me write \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\). So, multiplying this out:\n\n\\(4(75 + 117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)\\).\n\nLet me compute this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply 75 by \\(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\): \\(75\\cos\\theta + 75i\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nThen, multiply 117i by \\(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\): \\(117i\\cos\\theta + 117i^2\\sin\\theta\\). Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), this becomes \\(117i\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nSo, adding these together: \\(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta + i(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta)\\).\n\nNow, multiply by 4: \\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta) + i4(75\\sin\\theta + 117\\cos\\theta)\\).\n\nSo, the real part from the first term is \\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta)\\).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the second term: \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\). Since \\(e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\), multiplying this out:\n\n\\(24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nAgain, \\(i^2 = -1\\), so this becomes \\(24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nCombine like terms: \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)\\).\n\nSo, the real part from the second term is \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nNow, adding the real parts of both terms together:\n\nFirst term's real part: \\(4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta)\\).\n\nSecond term's real part: \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nSo, total real part is:\n\n\\(4*75\\cos\\theta - 4*117\\sin\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\n4*75 = 300, so 300cosθ.\n\n4*117 = 468, so -468sinθ.\n\n24cosθ and 36sinθ.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n(300cosθ + 24cosθ) + (-468sinθ + 36sinθ) = 324cosθ - 432sinθ.\n\nSo, the real part of the entire expression is \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. That is, find the maximum of \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nI remember that expressions of the form \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) can be rewritten as \\(R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi)\\), where \\(R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\). The maximum value of this expression is R, since the maximum of cosine is 1.\n\nSo, let me compute R for \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nHere, A = 324, B = -432.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).\n\nCompute 324 squared: 324*324. Let me compute that.\n\n324*300 = 97,200.\n\n324*24 = 7,776.\n\nSo, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 432*432.\n\nCompute 400*400 = 160,000.\n\nBut wait, 432 is 400 + 32.\n\nSo, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291,600)? Let me see.\n\nI know that 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.\n\nSo, R = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 324 and 432 are both multiples of 108.\n\n324 = 108*3, 432 = 108*4.\n\nSo, R = sqrt( (108*3)^2 + (108*4)^2 ) = 108*sqrt(9 + 16) = 108*sqrt(25) = 108*5 = 540.

There are 2024 circles each with radius 1 arranged in a certain way, and I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions \"Osem kruhov s polomerom 34\" which translates to \"Eight circles with radius 34.\" These circles are \"postupne dotýkajúcich sa,\" meaning they are sequentially tangent. Then, two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively. So, I think this means that there are eight circles arranged in a chain, each tangent to the next, and two of them are also tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle.\n\nSimilarly, it says \"2024 kruhov s polomerom 1 môže byť usporiadaných rovnakým spôsobom,\" which translates to \"2024 circles with radius 1 can be arranged in the same way.\" So, the same arrangement applies to these 2024 circles with radius 1.\n\nI need to find the inradius of triangle ABC. The inradius is the radius of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The formula for the inradius r is area divided by the semiperimeter, r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nBut how does this relate to the circles with radius 34 and 1? Maybe the arrangement of these circles is similar to the incircle, but scaled? Or perhaps it's a chain of circles tangent to each other and two sides of the triangle, forming a kind of \"chain\" along the angle bisector?\n\nWait, if there are eight circles with radius 34 arranged in a chain, each tangent to the next, and two of them are tangent to AB and BC, then this chain is probably along the angle bisector of angle B. Similarly, the 2024 circles with radius 1 are arranged in the same way, so their chain is also along the angle bisector.\n\nSo, perhaps the length of the angle bisector is related to the number of circles and their radii. Let me think about how the length of the angle bisector relates to the inradius.\n\nIn a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. The incenter is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, if we have a chain of circles along the angle bisector, each tangent to the next, the total length from the vertex to the incenter would be related to the number of circles and their radii.\n\nWait, but in this case, the circles are not necessarily starting from the vertex. Instead, two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. So, maybe the chain starts near the vertex and goes towards the incenter, with the first circle tangent to AB, the last circle tangent to BC, and the rest in between.\n\nIf there are eight circles with radius 34, then the distance from the vertex B to the incenter would be related to the number of circles and their radii. Similarly, for 2024 circles with radius 1, the same distance would be related to 2024 and 1.\n\nWait, but the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the sides, not necessarily the distance from the vertex to the incenter. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the length of the angle bisector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain of circles is similar to the incircle, but scaled. If the inradius is R, then the chain of circles with radius r would have a certain number n such that R = r * (n + 1). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about the chain of circles. If you have a chain of circles tangent to each other and to two sides of a triangle, the number of circles and their radii would relate to the distance between the sides along the angle bisector.\n\nIn a triangle, the distance from the vertex to the incenter along the angle bisector can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = \\frac{r}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}\n\nwhere r is the inradius and θ is the angle at the vertex.\n\nBut in this case, we have a chain of circles along the angle bisector. Each circle is tangent to the next, so the centers are spaced by twice the radius apart. Wait, no, if two circles are tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. But in this case, all circles have the same radius, so the distance between centers is 2r.\n\nBut in the problem, the circles are arranged along the angle bisector, each tangent to the next, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. So, the first circle is tangent to AB, the last circle is tangent to BC, and the rest are in between, each tangent to the previous one.\n\nSo, the total length from the point where the first circle touches AB to the point where the last circle touches BC is equal to the number of gaps between circles times twice the radius. Since there are eight circles, there are seven gaps between them, each of length 2*34. So, the total length would be 7*68 = 476.\n\nBut this length is also equal to the distance between the two sides AB and BC along the angle bisector. Wait, but AB and BC meet at vertex B, so the distance along the angle bisector from AB to BC is actually the length of the angle bisector from B to the incenter.\n\nWait, no. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, so the distance from the incenter to AB is r, and the distance from the incenter to BC is also r. So, the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is 2r. But in this case, the chain of circles is along the angle bisector, starting near AB and ending near BC, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last circle tangent to BC.\n\nSo, the total length of the chain is equal to the distance between AB and BC along the angle bisector, which is 2r. But the chain is made up of eight circles, each of radius 34, arranged such that each is tangent to the next. So, the centers of these circles are spaced 2*34 = 68 apart. Since there are eight circles, there are seven gaps between them, so the total length is 7*68 = 476.\n\nBut this total length should be equal to 2r, right? Because the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is 2r. So, 2r = 476, which would mean r = 238. But wait, that seems too large because the inradius can't be larger than the sides of the triangle. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is not 2r. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, so the distance from AB to the incenter is r, and from the incenter to BC is also r, so the total distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is 2r. But in this case, the chain of circles is from AB to BC, so the length of the chain is 2r.\n\nBut the chain is made up of eight circles, each of radius 34, arranged with centers spaced 68 apart. So, the total length is 7*68 = 476, which equals 2r. So, 2r = 476, so r = 238. But then, for the 2024 circles with radius 1, the same logic would give 2r = (2024 - 1)*2*1 = 4046, so r = 2023. But that can't be, because the inradius can't be both 238 and 2023. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the chain of circles is not from AB to BC, but rather, the chain is inside the triangle, starting near the incenter and going towards the sides. Hmm, but the problem says two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC, so the chain must start near AB and end near BC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not along the entire angle bisector, but only a portion of it. Maybe the inradius is related to the chain in a different way.\n\nLet me think again. If we have a chain of n circles, each of radius r, arranged along the angle bisector, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last circle tangent to BC, then the total length of the chain is (n - 1)*2r. This should equal the distance between AB and BC along the angle bisector, which is 2R, where R is the inradius.\n\nWait, so 2R = (n - 1)*2r, so R = (n - 1)*r.\n\nIn the first case, n = 8, r = 34, so R = 7*34 = 238.\n\nIn the second case, n = 2024, r = 1, so R = 2023*1 = 2023.\n\nBut the inradius R must be the same for both arrangements, right? Because it's the same triangle ABC. So, 238 = 2023? That doesn't make sense. So, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the chain is not along the entire angle bisector, but only a part of it. Maybe the chain is such that the first circle is tangent to AB and the inradius, and the last circle is tangent to BC and the inradius. Hmm, that might make more sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is similar to the inradius, but scaled by some factor. Maybe the inradius is equal to the radius of the chain circles multiplied by (n + 1). So, R = r*(n + 1). Let's test this.\n\nFor the first case, R = 34*(8 + 1) = 34*9 = 306.\n\nFor the second case, R = 1*(2024 + 1) = 2025.\n\nBut again, 306 ≠ 2025, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the inradius is related to the chain in a different way. Let me think about the formula for the length of a chain of circles tangent to two sides of an angle.\n\nI recall that in a wedge formed by two lines at an angle θ, the number of circles of radius r that can be packed along the angle bisector is given by n = floor( (π/θ) / (2 arcsin(r/d)) ), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the length of the chain is related to the inradius and the angle at B.\n\nWait, let's denote the angle at B as θ. Then, the distance from the vertex B to the incenter is d = R / sin(θ/2), where R is the inradius.\n\nBut in our case, the chain of circles is along the angle bisector, starting near AB and ending near BC. The total length of the chain is equal to the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector, which is 2R, as before.\n\nBut the chain is made up of n circles, each of radius r, so the total length is (n - 1)*2r. So, 2R = (n - 1)*2r, which simplifies to R = (n - 1)*r.\n\nSo, for the first case, R = 7*34 = 238.\n\nFor the second case, R = 2023*1 = 2023.\n\nBut since R must be the same, 238 = 2023, which is impossible. Therefore, my assumption that 2R = (n - 1)*2r must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the chain is not along the entire angle bisector, but only a portion of it. Maybe the chain is such that the first circle is tangent to AB and the inradius, and the last circle is tangent to BC and the inradius. So, the distance from AB to the inradius along the angle bisector is R, and similarly from BC to the inradius is R. So, the chain is from AB to the inradius, which is R, and from the inradius to BC, which is another R. So, the total chain length is 2R.\n\nBut the chain is made up of n circles, each of radius r, so the total length is (n - 1)*2r. So, 2R = (n - 1)*2r, which again gives R = (n - 1)*r.\n\nBut again, this leads to R being different for the two cases, which is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the chain is only on one side of the inradius. So, from AB to the inradius, which is R, and the chain is made up of n circles, each of radius r, so the length is (n - 1)*2r = R.\n\nSo, R = (n - 1)*2r.\n\nIn the first case, R = 7*2*34 = 476.\n\nIn the second case, R = 2023*2*1 = 4046.\n\nBut again, R must be the same, so 476 = 4046, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the chain of circles is similar to the inradius, but scaled by a factor. So, if the inradius is R, then the radius of the chain circles is r = R / k, where k is some integer.\n\nIn the first case, r = 34, so R = 34k.\n\nIn the second case, r = 1, so R = k.\n\nBut since R must be the same, 34k = k, which implies 34 = 1, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the number of circles relates to the inradius in a different way. Let me think about the formula for the number of circles that can be packed along an angle bisector.\n\nI found a formula online before that the number of circles of radius r that can be packed along the angle bisector of an angle θ is given by n = floor( (π/θ) / (2 arcsin(r/d)) ), where d is the distance from the vertex to the incenter. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the length of the angle bisector is related to the inradius and the number of circles.\n\nWait, the length of the angle bisector from vertex B to the incenter is d = R / sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle at B.\n\nIf we", "answer": "197"}

Nájdite najväčšie reálne číslo, ktoré je menšie ako $BD^2$ pre všetky takéto kosoštvorce.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola given by the equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the largest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombuses. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, and they are perpendicular to each other. So, yes, the diagonals intersect at right angles. So, that's a key property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, then the coordinates of these points must satisfy the hyperbola equation, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the points must be such that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x, y), (-x, -y), (p, q), (-p, -q). So, the rhombus is formed by these four points.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Let me write that down.\n\nThe distance between A(x, y) and B(p, q) is \\(\\sqrt{(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B(p, q) and C(-x, -y) is \\(\\sqrt{(p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2}\\).\n\nSince it's a rhombus, these two distances should be equal. So,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2} = \\sqrt{(p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2}\n\\]\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\n(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(p^2 + 2xp + x^2 + q^2 + 2yq + y^2\\)\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n\\[\n(p^2 + 2xp + x^2 + q^2 + 2yq + y^2) - (x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(2xp + 2yq - (-2xp - 2yq) = 0\\)\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Let me do it step by step.\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n\\(p^2 - p^2 = 0\\)\n\n\\(2xp - (-2xp) = 4xp\\)\n\n\\(x^2 - x^2 = 0\\)\n\n\\(q^2 - q^2 = 0\\)\n\n\\(2yq - (-2yq) = 4yq\\)\n\n\\(y^2 - y^2 = 0\\)\n\nSo, altogether, 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nSo, 4(xp + yq) = 0, which simplifies to xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: \\(xp + yq = 0\\).\n\nOkay, so that's a necessary condition for the sides to be equal.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor point A: \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nFor point B: \\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nSo, both points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nAdditionally, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC is \\(\\frac{-y - y}{-x - x} = \\frac{-2y}{-2x} = \\frac{y}{x}\\). Similarly, the slope of BD is \\(\\frac{-q - q}{-p - p} = \\frac{-2q}{-2p} = \\frac{q}{p}\\).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1:\n\n\\(\\frac{y}{x} \\cdot \\frac{q}{p} = -1\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{yq}{xp} = -1\\)\n\nBut from earlier, we have \\(xp + yq = 0\\), which can be rewritten as \\(xp = -yq\\). So, substituting into the slope product:\n\n\\(\\frac{yq}{xp} = \\frac{yq}{-yq} = -1\\), which is consistent. So, that condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the key equations we have are:\n\n1. \\(xp + yq = 0\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nWe need to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD connects points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q), the length BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q), which is \\(\\sqrt{(p + p)^2 + (q + q)^2} = \\sqrt{(2p)^2 + (2q)^2} = 2\\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}\\). Therefore, BD² is \\(4(p^2 + q^2)\\).\n\nSo, our goal is to find the maximum lower bound for BD², i.e., the largest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible such rhombuses, and then the answer would be that infimum.\n\nAlternatively, since we need the largest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses, it's equivalent to finding the infimum of BD², because the infimum is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, to find the infimum of BD², which is 4(p² + q²), we need to express p² + q² in terms of the hyperbola equation and the condition xp + yq = 0.\n\nLet me see. So, we have points A(x, y) and B(p, q) on the hyperbola, with xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can think of this as a dot product of vectors (x, y) and (p, q) being zero, meaning they are perpendicular. So, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, where O is the origin.\n\nSo, points A and B are such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nLet me recall that for hyperbola parametrization, we can use hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), a parametrization is \\(x = a \\sec \\theta\\), \\(y = b \\tan \\theta\\), or using hyperbolic functions: \\(x = a \\cosh t\\), \\(y = b \\sinh t\\). Alternatively, sometimes people use \\(x = a \\cos \\theta\\), \\(y = b \\sin \\theta\\), but that's for an ellipse. For hyperbola, it's usually hyperbolic functions or sec and tan.\n\nBut perhaps using parametric coordinates with an angle parameter might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinates in terms of slopes.\n\nWait, since OA is perpendicular to OB, the product of their slopes is -1. So, if the slope of OA is m, then the slope of OB is -1/m.\n\nSo, let me denote the slope of OA as m, so the slope of OB is -1/m.\n\nSo, point A can be represented as (x, y) where y = m x, and point B can be represented as (p, q) where q = (-1/m) p.\n\nSince both points lie on the hyperbola, substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor point A: \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{(m x)^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nSimilarly, for point B: \\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{(-p/m)^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nSimplify these equations.\n\nFor point A:\n\n\\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{m^2 x^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nFactor out x²:\n\n\\(x^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{m^2}{24} \\right) = 1\\)\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\n\\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{p^2}{24 m^2} = 1\\)\n\nFactor out p²:\n\n\\(p^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{24 m^2} \\right) = 1\\)\n\nSo, from point A, we can solve for x²:\n\n\\(x^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{m^2}{24} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{24 - 20 m^2}{480}} = \\frac{480}{24 - 20 m^2} = \\frac{480}{4(6 - 5 m^2)} = \\frac{120}{6 - 5 m^2}\\)\n\nSimilarly, from point B, solve for p²:\n\n\\(p^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{24 m^2} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{24 m^2 - 20}{480 m^2}} = \\frac{480 m^2}{24 m^2 - 20} = \\frac{480 m^2}{4(6 m^2 - 5)} = \\frac{120 m^2}{6 m^2 - 5}\\)\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for x² and p² in terms of m².\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD² = 4(p² + q²). Since q = (-1/m) p, then q² = (1/m²) p². So, BD² = 4(p² + (1/m²) p²) = 4 p² (1 + 1/m²) = 4 p² ( (m² + 1)/m² )\n\nFrom above, p² = 120 m² / (6 m² - 5). So, substituting:\n\nBD² = 4 * [120 m² / (6 m² - 5)] * [ (m² + 1)/m² ] = 4 * [120 (m² + 1) / (6 m² - 5) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD² = 480 (m² + 1) / (6 m² - 5)\n\nSo, BD² is expressed in terms of m². Let me denote t = m², so t > 0.\n\nSo, BD² = 480 (t + 1) / (6 t - 5)\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD² over all permissible t. So, we need to find the minimum value of the function f(t) = 480 (t + 1)/(6 t - 5) for t > 5/6, because the denominator 6t - 5 must be positive (since p² must be positive, from earlier expression p² = 120 m² / (6 m² - 5), so 6 m² - 5 > 0 => m² > 5/6). So, t > 5/6.\n\nSo, f(t) = 480 (t + 1)/(6 t - 5), t > 5/6.\n\nWe need to find the infimum of f(t) as t approaches 5/6 from the right and as t approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of f(t):\n\nAs t approaches 5/6 from the right, the denominator approaches 0 from the positive side, so f(t) approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, f(t) behaves like 480 t / 6 t = 80. So, the limit as t approaches infinity is 80.\n\nTherefore, f(t) decreases from infinity to 80 as t increases from 5/6 to infinity. So, the infimum of f(t) is 80.\n\nBut wait, is 80 attainable? As t approaches infinity, f(t) approaches 80, but never actually reaches it. So, 80 is the infimum, but it's not achieved for any finite t.\n\nTherefore, the largest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 80. Because BD² can get arbitrarily close to 80, but never actually reaches it. So, 80 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. So, f(t) = 480(t + 1)/(6t - 5", "answer": "480"}

Nájdite počet obyvateľov Aimeville, ktorí vlastnia všetky štyri z týchto vecí.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the different items they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a box of chocolate hearts, which is interesting because that might mean that the set of people owning chocolate hearts is the entire population. But let me check the problem again. It says, \"Okrem toho každý z 900 obyvateľov vlastní vrecko cukrových srdiečok.\" So yes, every single resident owns a box of chocolate hearts. That might be important because it could mean that the set of people owning chocolate hearts is the universal set here.\n\nNow, the other items: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden shovel. So, these are subsets of the 900 residents. Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items (excluding the chocolate hearts, I assume), and 234 own exactly three of these items. We need to find how many own all four items.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since we're dealing with multiple sets and their intersections, inclusion-exclusion is the way to go.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of people owning a diamond ring. So, |D| = 195.\n- Let G be the set of people owning golf clubs. So, |G| = 367.\n- Let S be the set of people owning a garden shovel. So, |S| = 562.\n- Let C be the set of people owning a box of chocolate hearts. We know |C| = 900, since everyone owns one.\n\nWe are told that 437 own exactly two of these items (excluding C, I think, because everyone owns C). Similarly, 234 own exactly three of these items (again, excluding C). We need to find the number of people who own all four, which would be |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since everyone owns C, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.\n\nWait, actually, since everyone owns C, the number of people owning all four is the same as the number owning D, G, and S. So, maybe I can ignore C for the purposes of calculating overlaps, because it's the universal set.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"presne dve z týchto vecí\" and \"presne tri z týchto vecí.\" The phrase \"týchto vecí\" refers to the four items mentioned: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden shovel, and chocolate hearts. But since everyone owns the chocolate hearts, does that mean that when they say \"presne dve\" or \"presne tri,\" they are counting the number of items excluding the chocolate hearts? Or including?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Medzi 900 obyvateľmi Aimeville je 195, ktorí vlastnia diamantový prsteň, 367, ktorí vlastnia sadu golfových palíc, a 562, ktorí vlastnia záhradnú lopatku. Okrem toho každý z 900 obyvateľov vlastní vrecko cukrových srdiečok.\" So, it's listing four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden shovel, and chocolate hearts. Then it says that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of these things. So, the \"týchto vecí\" refers to all four items. But since everyone owns the chocolate hearts, when they say someone owns exactly two or exactly three, they must be counting the number of non-chocolate heart items they own. Because otherwise, everyone would own at least one (the chocolate hearts), so owning exactly two would mean one more item, etc.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is \"presne dve z týchto vecí,\" which translates to \"exactly two of these things.\" So, if \"these things\" include the chocolate hearts, then someone owning exactly two would include the chocolate hearts and one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three would include the chocolate hearts and two others. But since everyone owns the chocolate hearts, the number of people owning exactly two items is the number of people who own the chocolate hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be chocolate hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be all four.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.\n\nBut let's formalize this. Let me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people owning only D.\n- Let b = number of people owning only G.\n- Let c = number of people owning only S.\n- Let d = number of people owning D and G but not S or C? Wait, no, since everyone owns C, so actually, all these overlaps include C.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, since C is the universal set.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a Venn diagram with three circles for D, G, and S, and the universal set being C, which is everyone. So, the total number of people is 900, and we have the counts for D, G, S, and the numbers of people owning exactly two and exactly three of D, G, S.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of people is 900, and each person owns at least the chocolate hearts. So, the other items (D, G, S) can be considered as subsets of the 900. The number of people owning exactly two items (including the chocolate hearts) would be the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S plus the chocolate hearts. Similarly, the number owning exactly three items would be the number owning exactly two of D, G, S plus the chocolate hearts. And the number owning all four would be the number owning all three of D, G, S plus the chocolate hearts.\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, which would mean they own the chocolate hearts plus one other item. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of these things, meaning they own the chocolate hearts plus two others. And we need to find the number who own all four, which is the chocolate hearts plus all three others.\n\nSo, in terms of the Venn diagram for D, G, S, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is 437, the number owning exactly two is 234, and the number owning all three is what we need to find, let's call it x. But wait, actually, in the standard inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the total is |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.\n\nBut in our case, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning exactly one, plus exactly two, plus exactly three. So, that would be 437 + 234 + x, where x is the number owning all three. But wait, actually, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, and exactly three. So, total = 437 + 234 + x.\n\nBut we also know that the total number of people is 900, and everyone owns C, so the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people owning only C. But wait, does anyone own only C? The problem doesn't specify, but it says \"Medzi 900 obyvateľmi Aimeville je 195, ktorí vlastnia diamantový prsteň, 367, ktorí vlastnia sadu golfových palíc, a 562, ktorí vlastnia záhradnú lopatku.\" So, these are the counts for D, G, S. It doesn't say anything about people owning none of these, but since everyone owns C, it's possible that some people own only C and none of D, G, S. Let me denote y as the number of people owning only C. Then, the total number of people is y + (number owning at least one of D, G, S) = 900.\n\nSo, number owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 - y. But we also have that number equal to 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + x (exactly four, but since everyone owns C, exactly four would be x, but actually, in terms of D, G, S, it's the number owning all three, which is x). Wait, no, in terms of the four items, exactly four would be x, but in terms of D, G, S, it's the same as owning all three, which is x.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- The four items are D, G, S, C.\n\n- Everyone owns C.\n\n- The number of people owning exactly two items: this would be people owning C and one other (D, G, or S). So, the count is the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S plus C.\n\n- Similarly, the number owning exactly three items: people owning C and two others (D, G, S). So, the count is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S plus C.\n\n- The number owning all four items: people owning C and all three others (D, G, S). So, that's the number of people owning all three of D, G, S plus C.\n\nBut in the problem, it's stated as \"presne dve z týchto vecí\" and \"presne tri z týchto vecí,\" which includes C. So, the counts given (437 and 234) are for people owning exactly two or exactly three items, including C.\n\nTherefore, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is 437, which means they own C and one other item. Similarly, the number owning exactly three items (including C) is 234, meaning they own C and two others. The number owning all four items is what we need to find, which is the number owning C and all three others, i.e., D, G, S.\n\nSo, in terms of the Venn diagram for D, G, S, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly one of D, G, S: 437 (since they own C and one other)\n\n- Exactly two of D, G, S: 234 (since they own C and two others)\n\n- Exactly three of D, G, S: x (which is the number we need to find, as they own C and all three others)\n\nTherefore, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is 437 + 234 + x.\n\nBut we also know that the total number of people is 900, and everyone owns C. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people owning only C. Let me denote y as the number of people owning only C. Then:\n\n437 + 234 + x + y = 900\n\nBut we don't know y yet. However, we can also use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the sets D, G, S.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|\n\nWe know |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.\n\nWe also know that |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x.\n\nSo, plugging into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|\n\nBut wait, |D∩G| includes those who own both D and G, which could be in the exactly two category or the exactly three category. Similarly for the other intersections.\n\nIn the Venn diagram, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is 234, which is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Wait, no, actually, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus 3 times the triple intersection. Because each pairwise intersection includes those who own all three.\n\nWait, let me recall: For three sets, the number of people owning exactly two is:\n\n(|D∩G| - |D∩G∩S|) + (|D∩S| - |D∩G∩S|) + (|G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|) = (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - 3|D∩G∩S|\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly one is:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| - 2(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + 3|D∩G∩S|\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express it as:\n\nNumber of people owning exactly one = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(number owning exactly two) - 3*(number owning exactly three)\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nIn the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of the pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nBut we also have:\n\n- The number of people owning exactly one = a + b + c\n\n- The number owning exactly two = d + e + f\n\n- The number owning exactly three = g\n\nWhere a, b, c are the regions with only D, only G, only S.\n\nd, e, f are the regions with D∩G, D∩S, G∩S, but not all three.\n\ng is the region with D∩G∩S.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na + b + c =", "answer": "73"}

Nájdite $AB\\cdot AC$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius R = 13. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle with radius r = 6.\n\nThe condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI. That seems like a significant geometric condition. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here? Or perhaps there's a theorem that relates these centers when such a perpendicularity condition is met.\n\nLet me think about coordinate geometry. Maybe I can place the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify things. Let's assume that point A is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, I can let the incenter I be somewhere in the plane, and the circumcenter O also somewhere else. But wait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can set up the coordinates such that IA is along one axis and OI along another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vector geometry could help. But I'm not sure. Let me think about other properties or formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, and other elements of the triangle.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI = √(R(R - 2r))\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. So, plugging in the given values, R = 13 and r = 6, so OI = √(13(13 - 12)) = √(13*1) = √13. So, the distance between O and I is √13.\n\nNow, the condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is a vector from O to I. So, if I can express IA and OI as vectors, their dot product should be zero.\n\nBut maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0), and the incenter I is at some point (d, e). Then, the circumcenter O is at some other point (h, k). The vector OI would be (d - h, e - k), and the vector IA would be (-d, -e) since IA goes from I to A.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero:\n\n(-d)(d - h) + (-e)(e - k) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-d(d - h) - e(e - k) = 0\n\nOr:\n\n-d² + dh - e² + ek = 0\n\nHmm, that's one equation, but I don't know the coordinates of O or I yet. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or other triangle relations. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, the length IA can be given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nWhere r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Similarly, the distance from the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula:\n\na = 2R \\sin A\n\nWhere a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly helps. Let me think about the Euler line. In any triangle, the incenter doesn't generally lie on the Euler line, which connects the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter. However, in some special triangles, like equilateral triangles, all centers coincide. But this isn't necessarily the case here.\n\nWait, but the condition IA perpendicular to OI might imply some specific relationship between the sides or angles. Maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem somewhere.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, and we know the lengths of IA and OI, perhaps we can form a right triangle. But wait, do I know the length of IA?\n\nI know the inradius r = 6, but IA is not just r. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is different. The formula for IA is:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 }\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the correct formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nYes, that's correct. So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, the distance from the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula:\n\na = 2R \\sin A\n\nSo, if I can find angle A, maybe I can find IA and relate it to OI.\n\nBut I don't know angle A yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumradius:\n\nOI^2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhich we already used earlier to find OI = √13.\n\nSo, OI = √13, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). And since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle formed by points I, A, and O is a right triangle at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, but OI is a segment from O to I, not necessarily from I to A.\n\nWait, actually, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So, in terms of coordinates, if I can express IA and OI as vectors, their dot product is zero.\n\nBut maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AIO. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle AIO is a right triangle with right angle at I. So, by Pythagoras:\n\nAI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2\n\nWait, is that correct? If IA is perpendicular to OI, then yes, triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2.\n\nSo, AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius R, right? Wait, no. The circumradius is the distance from O to any vertex, so AO = R = 13.\n\nSo, AO = 13, OI = √13, and AI is IA = 6 / sin(A/2). So, plugging into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))^2 + (√13)^2 = 13^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n36 / sin²(A/2) + 13 = 169\n\nSubtract 13 from both sides:\n\n36 / sin²(A/2) = 156\n\nDivide both sides by 36:\n\n1 / sin²(A/2) = 156 / 36 = 13 / 3\n\nSo, sin²(A/2) = 3 / 13\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = √(3/13)\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / √(3/13) = 6 * √(13/3) = 6 * (√13 / √3) = 2√39\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\n6 divided by sqrt(3/13) is 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = (6/sqrt(3)) * sqrt(13) = 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(13) = 2*sqrt(39). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, IA = 2√39.\n\nOkay, so now I have IA, OI, and AO. Maybe I can find angle A from this.\n\nWe have sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nThen, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2 * sqrt(3/13) * sqrt(10/13) = 2 * sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2√30 / 13.\n\nNow, since the circumradius R = 13, the side a (opposite angle A) is given by a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2√30 /13) = 4√30.\n\nSo, side a = BC = 4√30.\n\nOkay, so BC is 4√30. Now, I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote AB = c and AC = b. So, I need to find b * c.\n\nI know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the inradius. The area Δ can be expressed as r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the area is also equal to (a b c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides and R is the circumradius. So, Δ = (a b c) / (4R).\n\nBut I also have Δ = r * s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions:\n\n(a b c) / (4R) = r * s\n\nSo, (a b c) = 4R r s\n\nBut I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = Δ / s\n\nSo, Δ = r s = 6 s.\n\nAlso, from the area formula with sides and circumradius:\n\nΔ = (a b c) / (4R) = (a b c) / 52\n\nSo, 6 s = (a b c) / 52\n\nThus, a b c = 312 s\n\nBut I still have two variables here: a, b, c, and s. I know a = 4√30, so s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also know that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides. We have IA = 2√39, which we found earlier. The formula for IA is:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 }\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me recall the correct formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} = 2√39\n\nWe already used that earlier. So, IA = 2√39, which we found from the right triangle AIO.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the inradius and semiperimeter. The area is r*s, and also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, let's write that:\n\nΔ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A = r*s = 6*s\n\nWe have sin A = 2√30 /13, so:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2√30 /13) = 6*s\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b*c*√30)/13 = 6*s\n\nSo, b*c = (6*13*s)/√30 = (78 s)/√30\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nb*c = (78 * (4√30 + b + c)/2 ) / √30\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n78 * (4√30 + b + c)/2 = 39*(4√30 + b + c)\n\nSo, b*c = 39*(4√30 + b + c)/√30\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express b + c in terms of s.\n\nWait, s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a = 2s - 4√30\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nb*c = 39*(4√30 + 2s - 4√30)/√30 = 39*(2s)/√30 = (78 s)/√30\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm, so I'm going in circles here.\n\nMaybe I need another approach. Let me think about the formula that relates the sides, inradius, and circumradius.\n\nI recall that in any triangle:\n\na = 2R sin A\n\nb = 2R sin B\n\nc = 2R sin C\n\nSo, since R = 13, we have:\n\na = 26 sin A = 4√30\n\nWait, earlier we found a = 4√30, so 26 sin A = 4√30\n\nSo, sin A = (4√30)/26 = (2√30)/13, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, sin A = 2√30 /13, so angle A is known in terms of sine.\n\nNow, using the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Δ)/s = 6\n\nAnd Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2√30 /13) = (b*c*√30)/13\n\nSo, Δ = (b*c*√30)/13 = 6*s\n\nSo, (b*c*√30)/13 = 6*s => b*c = (6*13*s)/√30 = (78 s)/√30\n\nAgain, same equation.\n\nBut s = (a + b +", "answer": "468"}

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a, b, and c are non-negative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. It involves quadratic terms multiplied by the other variables. Let me write it out again to see if I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it.\n\nThe second equation is:\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.\n\nLooking at this, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLooking at the terms, I can group them as follows:\na²b + a²c = a²(b + c)\nSimilarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)\nAnd c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\na²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me do that.\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\na²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me write that as:\n300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.\n\nI can factor out the 300:\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or something. Let me recall that for three variables, we have the identity:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that will help here. Let me see if I can find another way.\n\nI also know that a + b + c = 300, so maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of that. The formula for the sum of squares is:\n\na² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac).\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\na² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc. Maybe that can help.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nExpressed in terms of S, Q, and P, let's see:\n\nFirst, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q.\n\nThen, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nNow, what about a³ + b³ + c³? Using the identity I mentioned earlier:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.\n\nSo, substituting S, Q, and P:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.\n\nCalculating 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.\n\nSo, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\n(27,000,000 - 600Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me simplify this:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600Q + 900Q = 300Q.\n\nSo, we have 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have another equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut we also know that S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300.\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, now we have to find non-negative integers a, b, c such that these two equations are satisfied.\n\nThis seems a bit more manageable. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can express abc in terms of ab + bc + ac.\n\nFrom equation 2: abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut Q = ab + bc + ac.\n\nSo, abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so abc is expressed in terms of Q.\n\nBut I also know that for three variables, the relationship between S, Q, and P is given by the equation:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the correct identity.\n\nActually, the correct identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the correct expansion is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) + 3(c + a)(b + c).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me actually expand (a + b + c)^3 properly.\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can relate it to our previous expressions.\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut maybe that's not the most straightforward path.\n\nAlternatively, since we have S = 300, Q, and P, and we have an equation involving Q and P, maybe we can find another equation involving Q and P.\n\nWait, we have S = 300, Q, and P, and we have 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving Q and P, I can solve for them.\n\nBut I only have two equations so far:\n\n1. S = 300.\n\n2. 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nI need another equation to solve for Q and P. But with three variables, we usually need three equations, but here we have two. Maybe I can find another relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that a, b, c are non-negative integers. So, maybe I can consider the possible values of Q and P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the possible values of a, b, c.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, and all are non-negative integers, perhaps I can assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, to reduce the number of cases.\n\nBut before that, let me see if I can find another equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the identity:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).\n\nWe already used that earlier to express a² + b² + c² in terms of Q.\n\nBut maybe I can use another identity.\n\nWait, let me think about the expression for abc.\n\nWe have abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can express abc in terms of Q, maybe I can find possible integer solutions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I can think about the possible values of Q.\n\nGiven that a, b, c are non-negative integers summing to 300, the maximum value of Q occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible.\n\nWait, actually, the maximum of ab + bc + ac occurs when two variables are as large as possible, but given that a + b + c is fixed, the maximum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is zero.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nSuppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and ab is maximized when a = b = 150, so ab = 150*150 = 22,500.\n\nSimilarly, if c is not zero, but say a = b = 150, c = 0, then ab + bc + ac = 22,500 + 0 + 0 = 22,500.\n\nAlternatively, if a = 300, b = c = 0, then ab + bc + ac = 0.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Q is 22,500, and the minimum is 0.\n\nBut in our case, Q is involved in the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q = P + 2,000,000.\n\nSince Q is at most 22,500, 100Q is at most 2,250,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nTherefore, P must be non-negative because a, b, c are non-negative integers, so abc is non-negative.\n\nSo, 100Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 ⇒ Q ≥ 20,000.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought Q can be at most 22,500, so 20,000 ≤ Q ≤ 22,500.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nHmm, that's a manageable range. So, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\n20,000 ≤ Q ≤ 22,500.\n\nAnd P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nGiven that Q is between 20,000 and 22,500, P will be between:\n\nFor Q = 20,000: P = 2,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nFor Q = 22,500: P = 2,250,000 - 2,000,000 = 250,000.\n\nSo, P is between 0 and 250,000.\n\nBut P is the product abc, which is non-negative.\n\nSo, now, we have that Q is between 20,000 and 22,500, and P is between 0 and 250,000.\n\nBut how can we find Q and P?\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the fact that for three variables a, b, c, the relationship between S, Q, and P is given by the equation:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the correct identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³", "answer": "601"}

O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a set F of line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB. I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, then find p+q.\n\nAlright, let me try to visualize this. We have the first quadrant, so all points have positive x and y coordinates. Point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So segment AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a line in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, the set F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each such segment PQ is a line segment from some point (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. So by the distance formula, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies p² + q² = 1.\n\nSo for each such segment PQ, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. So the set F is all such segments where P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q) with p² + q² = 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB. So, except for AB itself, point C isn't on any other PQ in F. So, I need to find such a point C on AB and compute OC².\n\nFirst, let me parametrize segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized as follows. Let me find the equation of line AB.\n\nThe slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0): 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t is between 0 and 1/2. Wait, actually, since A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), t should go from 0 to 1/2. So, parametric equations: x = t, y = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, for t in [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, point C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) for some t between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, I need to find such a point C that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on them. So, for any other PQ, which is from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, the point C is not on PQ.\n\nBut wait, except for AB, which is one such segment, so C is on AB, but not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, to find such a point C, I need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, for all other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, perhaps, for point C, the only PQ in F that contains C is AB itself.\n\nSo, to find such a point C, I need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, perhaps, for point C, the only solution to the equation of PQ passing through C is when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, let me think about the equation of a general PQ in F.\n\nA general segment PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.\n\nThe equation of PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, since it's a straight line from (p,0) to (0,q).\n\nSo, for any point (x,y) on PQ, x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, for point C = (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), it lies on PQ if and only if t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.\n\nBut since p² + q² = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²), but maybe it's better to keep it as p² + q² = 1.\n\nSo, substituting point C into the equation of PQ:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3)t)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt/p - (sqrt(3)t)/q + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1.\n\nNow, since p² + q² = 1, perhaps we can express this in terms of p or q.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since point C is on AB, which is PQ when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, and indeed, p² + q² = (1/2)² + (sqrt(3)/2)² = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, for point C, which is on AB, we have that it's on PQ when PQ is AB, but we need to ensure that it's not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, for any other PQ in F, which is from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, and p ≠ 1/2 or q ≠ sqrt(3)/2, the point C should not lie on that PQ.\n\nSo, for point C, the equation t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1 should have only one solution, which is when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Maybe by setting up the equation and showing that for other p and q, the equation doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the envelope of all such PQ segments. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to all these segments. The point C would be the point where the envelope touches AB, meaning that it's the only point on AB that is on the envelope, hence not on any other PQ.\n\nWait, that might be a good approach. The envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves.\n\nThe general method for finding the envelope is to solve the system:\n\nF(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0,\n\nand\n\ndF/dp = -x/p² + 0 = 0,\n\ndF/dq = -y/q² + 0 = 0.\n\nWait, no, actually, the envelope is found by solving F(p, q, x, y) = 0 and dF/dλ = 0, where λ is the parameter. But in this case, the parameter is p and q, but they are related by p² + q² = 1.\n\nAlternatively, since p and q are related by p² + q² = 1, we can parameterize p and q in terms of a single parameter, say θ, such that p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² = 1.\n\nSo, let me set p = cosθ and q = sinθ, where θ is in (0, π/2) because p and q are positive.\n\nThen, the equation of PQ becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1, for θ in (0, π/2).\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the formula for the envelope of a family of curves given by F(θ, x, y) = 0.\n\nThe envelope satisfies F(θ, x, y) = 0 and dF/dθ = 0.\n\nSo, let's compute dF/dθ.\n\nF(θ, x, y) = x/cosθ + y/sinθ - 1 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/dθ:\n\ndF/dθ = x * (sinθ)/cos²θ + y * (-cosθ)/sin²θ = 0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx * (sinθ)/cos²θ - y * (cosθ)/sin²θ = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nx sin³θ = y cos³θ.\n\nSo, x sin³θ = y cos³θ.\n\nNow, from F(θ, x, y) = 0, we have x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1,\n\n2) x sin³θ = y cos³θ.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of θ.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = x sin³θ / cos³θ.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nx/cosθ + (x sin³θ / cos³θ)/sinθ = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/cosθ + x sin²θ / cos³θ = 1.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1/cosθ + sin²θ / cos³θ] = 1.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx [ (cos²θ + sin²θ) / cos³θ ] = 1.\n\nBut cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so:\n\nx [ 1 / cos³θ ] = 1 => x = cos³θ.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, y = x sin³θ / cos³θ = cos³θ * sin³θ / cos³θ = sin³θ.\n\nSo, the envelope is given by x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, but let me check:\n\nIf x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ, then x^(2/3) = cos²θ, y^(2/3) = sin²θ, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the curve that is tangent to all these lines PQ.\n\nNow, the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to this astroid. Because AB is one of the lines PQ, and the envelope is the astroid, so the point of tangency is the only point where AB touches the astroid, which is point C.\n\nTherefore, point C is the point of tangency of AB with the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, to find point C, we need to find the point where line AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nGiven that AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can find the point of tangency by solving the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nBut since the line is tangent to the astroid, this system should have exactly one solution, which is the point C.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the condition for tangency: substituting y from the line into the astroid equation and ensuring that the resulting equation has a double root.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t³, and similarly, y = (-sqrt(3)t³ + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThen, x^(2/3) = t², and y^(2/3) = [(-sqrt(3)t³ + sqrt(3)/2)]^(2/3).\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, let's work directly with x and y.\n\nSo, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThis equation should have a double root at point C, meaning that it's tangent there.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can also use calculus. The derivative of the astroid at point C should be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, let's compute the derivative of the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.\n\nSo, dy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).\n\nAt point C, the slope of the astroid is equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3). So,\n\n- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\n", "answer": "23"}

I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, looking at the product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a product over all 13th roots of unity, except ω=1, but wait, actually, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so that term is included. So, the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes ω^0=1.\n\nLet me write out the general term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me see if I can factor it.\n\nLooking at 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, perhaps I can factor it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let me rearrange it: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let's check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers. The roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). That's the same as [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I remember that the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because ω^k are the 13th roots of unity. So, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1, but with a sign change because each term is (a - ω^k) instead of (ω^k - a). Wait, actually, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1). So, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nTherefore, applying this to our case, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^13 - 1], and similarly ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nMultiplying the two negatives gives a positive, so it's [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. I know that (1 + i) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, both (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 have a modulus of 64*sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 in terms of the unit circle because angles are periodic modulo 2π. So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{iπ/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2). Similarly, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-iπ/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(2)/2*(1 + i) = 64*(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = 64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = 64(1 + i) - 1 = 63 + 64i, and (1 - i)^13 - 1 = 64(1 - i) - 1 = 63 - 64i.\n\nSo, the product becomes (63 + 64i)(63 - 64i). That's a difference of squares, so it's 63^2 - (64i)^2. Let's compute that.\n\n63^2 is 3969, and (64i)^2 is 64^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096. So, 3969 - (-4096) = 3969 + 4096 = 8065.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the product is (63 + 64i)(63 - 64i) = 63^2 - (64i)^2 = 3969 - (4096 * (-1)) = 3969 + 4096 = 8065. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8065. But wait, let me double-check my steps because 8065 seems a bit large, and we're supposed to find the remainder modulo 1000, which would be 65. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back. When I computed (1 + i)^13, I got 64(1 + i). Let me verify that. (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i. (1 + i)^2 = 2i. (1 + i)^3 = 2i(1 + i) = 2i - 2. (1 + i)^4 = (2i - 2)(1 + i) = 2i(1 + i) - 2(1 + i) = 2i + 2i^2 - 2 - 2i = 2i - 2 - 2 - 2i = -4. Hmm, so (1 + i)^4 = -4. Then, (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64. Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = -64*(1 + i) = -64 - 64i. Wait, that contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute (1 + i)^13 correctly. Let's use De Moivre's theorem. (1 + i) has modulus sqrt(2) and angle π/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}. (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 in terms of direction because angles are modulo 2π. So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{iπ/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(2)/2*(1 + i) = 64*(1 + i). Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got -64 -64i. That's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute (1 + i)^4. (1 + i)^2 = 2i, so (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. Then, (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64. Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i. So, that's different from the De Moivre's result. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the angle. Let's see, 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ} * e^{iπ/4} = -1 * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-2)/2*(1 + i) = 64*(-1)*(1 + i) = -64(1 + i). So, that matches the step-by-step calculation. So, my initial mistake was not accounting for the fact that 13π/4 is more than 2π, so the angle wraps around, but the direction is in the third quadrant, hence the negative sign.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Therefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product becomes (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute that. It's (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous result. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nTherefore, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, multiply the real parts: (-65)*(-65) = 4225.\n\nThen, the outer", "answer": "321"}

A number \\( n \\) is \\( b \\)-beautiful if when written in base \\( b \\), it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to be two-digit in base \\( b \\). In any base \\( b \\), a two-digit number can be expressed as \\( n = a \\times b + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\). That means \\( a \\) can range from 1 to \\( b-1 \\) (since the first digit can't be zero) and \\( c \\) can range from 0 to \\( b-1 \\).\n\nThe condition for \\( n \\) being \\( b \\)-beautiful is that \\( a + c = \\sqrt{n} \\). Since \\( n = a \\times b + c \\), substituting that in, we get \\( a + c = \\sqrt{a \\times b + c} \\). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\( (a + c)^2 = a \\times b + c \\)\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a \\times b + c \\)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to group like terms:\n\n\\( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a \\times b - c = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\). Let's try that.\n\nStarting from \\( (a + c)^2 = a \\times b + c \\), we can solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( a \\times b = (a + c)^2 - c \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b = \\frac{(a + c)^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\( (a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b = \\frac{a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nLet me split the fraction:\n\n\\( b = \\frac{a^2}{a} + \\frac{2ac}{a} + \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\\( b = a + 2c + \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be an integer, the term \\( \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\) must also be an integer. Let's denote this term as \\( k \\), so:\n\n\\( k = \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\( a \\) divides \\( c^2 - c \\). So, \\( a \\) is a divisor of \\( c(c - 1) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\), \\( a \\) is at least 1 and at most \\( b - 1 \\), and \\( c \\) is between 0 and \\( b - 1 \\). But since \\( a \\) is a digit in the two-digit number, \\( a \\) must be at least 1.\n\nSo, for each base \\( b \\), we can iterate over possible values of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) such that \\( a \\) divides \\( c(c - 1) \\), and then check if the resulting \\( b \\) is an integer.\n\nBut since we need to find the smallest \\( b \\) where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe it's better to approach this by considering possible values of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) and then computing \\( b \\), then counting how many such \\( b \\) exist for each base.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about the equation again:\n\n\\( (a + c)^2 = a b + c \\)\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n\\( a b = (a + c)^2 - c \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b = \\frac{(a + c)^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\( (a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b = a + 2c + \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\)\n\nAs before, so \\( \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\) must be integer. Let me denote \\( d = c^2 - c \\). So, \\( a \\) divides \\( d \\). Therefore, \\( a \\) is a divisor of \\( c(c - 1) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( c \\) is a digit in base \\( b \\), \\( c \\) can be from 0 to \\( b - 1 \\). But since \\( a \\) is at least 1, and \\( a \\) divides \\( c(c - 1) \\), let's consider possible values of \\( c \\) and \\( a \\).\n\nLet me consider possible values of \\( c \\). Since \\( c \\) is a digit, it can be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to \\( b - 1 \\). But \\( c = 0 \\) would make \\( d = 0 \\), so \\( a \\) divides 0, which is always true, but let's see:\n\nIf \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( d = 0 \\), so \\( b = a + 0 + 0 = a \\). But \\( a \\) is a digit in base \\( b \\), so \\( a < b \\). But \\( b = a \\), which would imply \\( a < a \\), which is impossible. So \\( c = 0 \\) is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, \\( c = 1 \\): then \\( d = 1 - 1 = 0 \\). So again, \\( a \\) divides 0, which is always true. Then \\( b = a + 2*1 + 0 = a + 2 \\). But \\( a \\) is a digit in base \\( b \\), so \\( a < b \\). Since \\( b = a + 2 \\), \\( a < a + 2 \\), which is always true. So for \\( c = 1 \\), \\( b = a + 2 \\). But \\( a \\) must be at least 1, so \\( b \\geq 3 \\). Let's see if this gives us a valid \\( n \\).\n\nWait, but let's check if \\( n = a \\times b + c \\) is a perfect square, because \\( \\sqrt{n} = a + c \\). So \\( n = (a + c)^2 \\). So for \\( c = 1 \\), \\( n = (a + 1)^2 \\). But \\( n = a \\times b + 1 \\). So,\n\n\\( (a + 1)^2 = a \\times b + 1 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( a^2 + 2a + 1 = a b + 1 \\)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\( a^2 + 2a = a b \\)\n\nDivide both sides by \\( a \\) (since \\( a \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\( a + 2 = b \\)\n\nWhich is consistent with our earlier result. So for each \\( a \\geq 1 \\), \\( c = 1 \\), \\( b = a + 2 \\), and \\( n = (a + 1)^2 \\). But we need to ensure that \\( c = 1 \\) is a valid digit in base \\( b \\), which it is since \\( 1 < b \\) as \\( b = a + 2 \\geq 3 \\).\n\nSo for each \\( a \\geq 1 \\), we can have a \\( b = a + 2 \\) and a corresponding \\( n = (a + 1)^2 \\). But wait, does this mean that for each \\( b \\geq 3 \\), there is at least one \\( b \\)-beautiful number? Because for each \\( b \\), we can set \\( a = b - 2 \\) and \\( c = 1 \\), giving \\( n = (b - 1)^2 \\). Let me check with the example given: \\( 81 \\) is 13-beautiful. Let's see, \\( b = 13 \\), \\( a = 6 \\), \\( c = 3 \\). Wait, but according to our earlier case, if \\( c = 1 \\), \\( a = b - 2 = 11 \\), but in the example, \\( a = 6 \\), \\( c = 3 \\). So that's a different case.\n\nSo, the case \\( c = 1 \\) gives us one \\( b \\)-beautiful number for each \\( b \\geq 3 \\). But the problem is asking for bases \\( b \\) where there are more than ten such numbers. So, we need to find \\( b \\) such that there are at least 11 pairs \\( (a, c) \\) satisfying the conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find \\( b \\) such that the number of solutions \\( (a, c) \\) to \\( (a + c)^2 = a b + c \\) is greater than 10.\n\nLet me try to find a way to count the number of solutions for a given \\( b \\).\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n\\( (a + c)^2 = a b + c \\)\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\n\\( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\). Maybe I can fix \\( c \\) and solve for \\( a \\), or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( b \\). From the equation:\n\n\\( a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( a \\). For each \\( c \\), we can solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = \\frac{-(2c - b) \\pm \\sqrt{(2c - b)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (c^2 - c)}}{2} \\)\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\n\\( D = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) \\)\n\nExpand \\( (2c - b)^2 \\):\n\n\\( 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -4bc + b^2 + 4c \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( D = b^2 - 4bc + 4c \\)\n\nFor \\( a \\) to be an integer, \\( D \\) must be a perfect square. Let me denote \\( D = k^2 \\), so:\n\n\\( b^2 - 4bc + 4c = k^2 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nLet me consider that \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\), so \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq b - 1 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq c \\leq b - 1 \\). Also, \\( a + c = \\sqrt{n} \\), and \\( n = a b + c \\). So \\( n \\) must be a perfect square, and \\( a + c \\) must be its square root.\n\nLet me denote \\( s = a + c \\), so \\( s = \\sqrt{n} \\), which implies \\( n = s^2 \\). Therefore, \\( s^2 = a b + c \\). But since \\( s = a + c \\), we have:\n\n\\( s^2 = a b + c \\)\n\nBut \\( c = s - a \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( s^2 = a b + (s - a) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( s^2 = a b + s - a \\)\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\( s^2 - s = a (b - 1) \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\)\n\nSince \\( a \\) must be an integer, \\( b - 1 \\) must divide \\( s^2 - s \\). Also, \\( a \\) must satisfy \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq b - 1 \\), and \\( c = s - a \\) must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq c \\leq b - 1 \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( b \\), we can find all \\( s \\) such that \\( b - 1 \\) divides \\( s^2 - s \\), and then check if \\( a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\) is an integer between 1 and \\( b - 1 \\), and \\( c = s - a \\) is between 0 and \\( b - 1 \\).\n\nThis seems promising. Let me formalize this:\n\nFor a given \\( b \\), the number of \\( b \\)-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers \\( s \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( s^2 - s \\) is divisible by \\( b - 1 \\).\n2. \\( a = \\frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \\) is an integer with \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq b - 1 \\).\n3. \\( c = s - a \\) is an integer with \\( 0 \\leq c \\leq b - 1 \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( b \\), we can iterate over possible \\( s \\) values and count how many satisfy these conditions.\n\nBut since we need to find the smallest \\( b \\) where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions in terms of \\( b \\).\n\nLet me consider that \\( s^2 - s = a (b - 1) \\). So, \\( s(s - 1) = a (b - 1) \\). Since \\( a \\) is a positive integer less than \\( b \\), \\( a \\) can be any divisor of \\( s(s - 1) \\) such that \\( a \\leq b - 1 \\).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since \\( s = a + c \\), and \\( c \\) is a digit, \\( s \\) can range from \\( a \\) (if \\( c = 0 \\)) up to \\( a + (b - 1) \\). But since \\( a \\geq 1 \\), the minimum \\( s \\) is 1 (if \\( a = 1 \\), \\( c = 0 \\)), and the maximum \\( s \\) is \\( (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2 \\). But", "answer": "211"}

Each side of the rectangle must lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The Asymptote diagram shows three examples of such rectangles, so I can use that as a reference.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So, the central angle between each vertex is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That means each vertex is 30 degrees apart from the next one.\n\nNow, the problem is about forming rectangles. A rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form these rectangles. So, I need to figure out how many such rectangles can be formed by connecting vertices with sides or diagonals.\n\nI remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, it's definitely even, so that should help.\n\nLet me think about how rectangles are formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps. For example, in a regular hexagon (6 sides), opposite sides are parallel. Similarly, in a dodecagon, sides separated by 6 steps are parallel because 12/2 = 6. So, sides that are 6 apart are parallel.\n\nBut wait, in a dodecagon, there are more possibilities for parallel sides because 12 is divisible by more numbers. For example, sides can be 3 apart, 4 apart, etc., and still be parallel. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of steps between vertices.\n\nEach side of the dodecagon can be considered as a vector from one vertex to the next. The direction of each side is 30 degrees apart. So, if I pick two sides that are parallel, their vectors must be in the same direction or opposite directions.\n\nBut for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides, each pair perpendicular to the other. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned along two different directions that are perpendicular to each other.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides are multiples of 30 degrees. So, to get perpendicular sides, the angle between the two directions should be 90 degrees. Since 90 degrees is 3 steps of 30 degrees each (because 30*3=90). So, if one side is along a certain direction, the other side of the rectangle should be along a direction that is 3 steps away.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If I have a side that is, say, from vertex 0 to vertex 1, which is 30 degrees, then a perpendicular direction would be 30 + 90 = 120 degrees, which is the direction from vertex 0 to vertex 4 (since each step is 30 degrees, so 4 steps is 120 degrees). Similarly, the opposite direction would be 30 - 90 = -60 degrees, which is equivalent to 300 degrees, which is the direction from vertex 0 to vertex 10.\n\nSo, in general, for any side, the perpendicular directions are 3 steps away in either direction. Therefore, to form a rectangle, I need to choose two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by 3 steps.\n\nBut how does this translate into counting the number of rectangles?\n\nMaybe I should think about the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by 3 steps, such that they intersect to form a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting four points (vertices) that form a rectangle. For four points to form a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the diagonals must bisect each other.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths. The length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips more vertices.\n\nBut in this case, the sides of the rectangle can be either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. So, the sides of the rectangle can be of different lengths, as long as they are either sides or diagonals.\n\nWait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can be of different lengths. So, the sides of the rectangle can be of different lengths, but they have to be either sides or diagonals.\n\nBut for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal. So, if one side is a side of the dodecagon, the opposite side must also be a side of the dodecagon. Similarly, if one side is a diagonal, the opposite side must be the same type of diagonal.\n\nTherefore, the rectangle can be formed by two pairs of sides or two pairs of diagonals, or a combination of sides and diagonals, as long as the opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n\nBut wait, in a regular dodecagon, sides are all the same length, but diagonals can be of different lengths. So, if I use a side and a diagonal, the opposite sides must also be the same. So, if one side is a side of the dodecagon, the opposite side must also be a side, and the other two sides must be diagonals of the same length.\n\nAlternatively, all four sides of the rectangle could be diagonals, as long as opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider different cases based on the types of sides used in the rectangle.\n\nCase 1: All four sides are sides of the dodecagon.\n\nCase 2: Two sides are sides of the dodecagon, and the other two are diagonals.\n\nCase 3: All four sides are diagonals.\n\nWait, but in a regular dodecagon, if all four sides are sides of the dodecagon, then the figure formed is actually a rectangle only if the sides are arranged such that they are perpendicular. But in a regular dodecagon, consecutive sides are not perpendicular. The internal angle is 150 degrees, so consecutive sides are not perpendicular. Therefore, a rectangle cannot be formed by four sides of the dodecagon because the angles between them are not 90 degrees.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 is impossible. So, all rectangles must have at least two sides that are diagonals.\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, they have a rectangle that seems to be formed by sides and diagonals. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it draws a dodecagon with vertices at every 30 degrees. Then it draws a rectangle connecting vertices 210, 240, 30, and 60. Let me convert these to degrees:\n\n- 210 degrees is 7 steps from 0 (since 210/30=7)\n- 240 degrees is 8 steps\n- 30 degrees is 1 step\n- 60 degrees is 2 steps\n\nWait, so the rectangle connects vertices 7, 8, 1, and 2. Hmm, let me see the connections:\n\n- From 7 to 8: that's a side of the dodecagon.\n- From 8 to 1: that's a diagonal, skipping 3 vertices (from 8 to 1 is 3 steps: 8 to 9, 9 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 0, 0 to 1. Wait, that's actually 5 steps. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in a dodecagon, the number of steps between two vertices can be calculated as the minimal number of edges between them. So, from 8 to 1: the minimal path is either going clockwise or counterclockwise. From 8 to 1 clockwise: 8 to 9, 9 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 0, 0 to 1: that's 5 steps. Counterclockwise: 8 to 7, 7 to 6, 6 to 5, 5 to 4, 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1: that's 7 steps. So, the minimal is 5 steps. So, the diagonal from 8 to 1 skips 4 vertices (since steps between are 5, so skips 4). So, that's a longer diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, from 1 to 2: that's a side.\n\nFrom 2 to 7: that's a diagonal. Let's see: from 2 to 7, clockwise: 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7: 5 steps. Counterclockwise: 2 to 1, 1 to 0, 0 to 11, 11 to 10, 10 to 9, 9 to 8, 8 to 7: 7 steps. So, minimal is 5 steps, so skips 4 vertices.\n\nSo, in this rectangle, two sides are sides of the dodecagon (7-8 and 1-2), and the other two sides are diagonals (8-1 and 2-7). So, this is a rectangle with two sides as edges and two sides as diagonals.\n\nSo, in this case, the rectangle is formed by two sides and two diagonals. So, that's Case 2.\n\nSimilarly, another rectangle might be formed by four diagonals. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I pick four diagonals that form a rectangle. For example, connecting vertices 0, 3, 6, 9. Wait, but in a dodecagon, 0 to 3 is a diagonal, 3 to 6 is another, 6 to 9, and 9 to 0. But wait, 0 to 3 is 3 steps, 3 to 6 is another 3 steps, etc. So, connecting every third vertex. But in a dodecagon, connecting every third vertex would form a regular quadrilateral, which is a square, since 12/3=4, so it's a square. So, that's a rectangle.\n\nBut wait, in a regular dodecagon, connecting every third vertex would actually form a regular quadrilateral, which is a square, because 12 divided by 3 is 4, so it's a square. So, that's a rectangle.\n\nSimilarly, connecting every fourth vertex would form a triangle, but wait, 12 divided by 4 is 3, so that would form a triangle? Wait, no, connecting every fourth vertex in a dodecagon would actually form a regular triangle, but since 12 is divisible by 3, connecting every fourth vertex would actually form a regular triangle. Wait, no, 12 divided by 4 is 3, so connecting every fourth vertex would form a regular triangle? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, connecting every k-th vertex in an n-gon forms a regular n/k-gon if n is divisible by k. So, in a dodecagon (n=12), connecting every 3rd vertex (k=3) forms a regular 4-gon, which is a square. Connecting every 4th vertex (k=4) would form a regular 3-gon, which is a triangle. Connecting every 6th vertex would form a regular 2-gon, which is a line segment, but that's degenerate.\n\nSo, in this case, connecting every 3rd vertex forms a square, which is a rectangle. So, that's another case where all four sides are diagonals.\n\nSo, in total, there are two types of rectangles: those with two sides as edges and two sides as diagonals, and those with all four sides as diagonals.\n\nTherefore, I need to count both types.\n\nLet me first count the rectangles with two sides as edges and two sides as diagonals.\n\nTo form such a rectangle, I need to choose two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair is separated by a certain number of steps, and the other pair is separated by a different number of steps, such that the sides are perpendicular.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the sides are separated by 30 degrees. So, to get perpendicular sides, the angle between them should be 90 degrees, which is 3 steps (since 30*3=90). So, if one pair of sides is separated by 'a' steps, the other pair should be separated by 'a + 3' steps or 'a - 3' steps, but considering the minimal steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors. Each side can be represented as a vector with a certain direction. For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the vectors can be represented in the complex plane as e^(i*30°*k) for k=0,1,...,11.\n\nSo, if I have two vectors v1 and v2, they are perpendicular if v1 · v2 = 0.\n\nIn complex numbers, the dot product is equivalent to the real part of v1 multiplied by the conjugate of v2.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the angle between two sides is 30 degrees, to get a right angle, the difference in their step counts should be 3, because 3*30=90 degrees.\n\nSo, if one side is step 'k', the other side should be step 'k + 3' or 'k - 3' to be perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, for each side, there are two possible directions for the perpendicular side.\n\nBut in terms of forming rectangles, I need to choose two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, and the two pairs should be perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two perpendicular directions, and then count how many rectangles can be formed in each direction.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how many pairs of parallel sides there are, and then for each pair, how many perpendicular pairs exist.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of rectangles as the number of ways to choose two distinct pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, such that the two pairs are perpendicular.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the number of pairs of parallel sides is equal to the number of directions. Since each direction is separated by 30 degrees, and there are 12 directions, but each pair of opposite sides is considered the same direction.\n\nWait, actually, in a regular dode", "answer": "315"}

The list has three properties:\n\n1. The sum of the numbers is 30.\n2. The unique mode is 9.\n3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.\n\nHmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that tells me something about the number of elements in the list.\n\nLet me think about the median. If the median isn't in the list, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements. Because when you have an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If that average is an integer not in the list, then those two middle numbers must be different and their average is an integer. So, the list must have an even number of elements.\n\nLet me denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is the average of the two middle numbers, n must be even. Let's say n = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms when the list is sorted.\n\nGiven that the median is a positive integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must be two different integers whose average is an integer. That means those two numbers must be either both even or both odd, so their average is an integer. But since the median isn't in the list, those two numbers can't both be the same as the median. So, for example, if the median is m, then the two middle numbers could be m-1 and m+1, averaging to m, but m isn't in the list.\n\nNow, the mode is 9, and it's unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's think about how many times 9 appears. Let's denote the number of 9s as f. Then, every other number in the list must appear fewer than f times.\n\nAlso, the sum of all numbers is 30. So, if I have f 9s, the total contribution from 9s is 9f. The remaining sum is 30 - 9f, which must be distributed among the other numbers.\n\nSince all numbers are positive integers, the remaining numbers must be at least 1. Also, since the mode is unique, no other number can appear f times or more.\n\nLet me try to figure out possible values for f.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of elements. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, and the list has an even number of elements, the smallest possible n is 2. But if n=2, the median would be the average of the two numbers, which would have to be an integer not in the list. But if n=2, the two numbers would have to be such that their average is an integer not equal to either of them. For example, 1 and 3 average to 2, which isn't in the list. But in that case, the mode would have to be 9, but if n=2, both numbers can't be 9 because then the mode would be 9, but the median would be 9, which is in the list. So n=2 is impossible because the median would have to be 9, which is in the list, contradicting the condition.\n\nSo n must be at least 4. Let's try n=4.\n\nIf n=4, then the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms. Let's denote the sorted list as [a, b, c, d]. The median is (b + c)/2, which is an integer not in the list. So b and c must be two different numbers whose average is an integer, and that integer isn't in the list.\n\nAlso, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. Since n=4, the maximum frequency is 2 (if two numbers are the same). But if 9 appears twice, then the other two numbers can appear at most once. So let's see.\n\nSuppose 9 appears twice. Then the list has two 9s and two other numbers. The sum is 30, so 9*2 + x + y = 30 => x + y = 12. The median is (b + c)/2, which is an integer not in the list. Since the list is sorted, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d. If two of the numbers are 9, let's say b and c are 9. Then the median would be (9 + 9)/2 = 9, which is in the list, contradicting the condition. So b and c can't both be 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a and b are 9, but then c and d would be greater than or equal to 9. Then the median would be (9 + c)/2. Since c ≥9, the median would be at least 9. But if c is 9, then the median is 9, which is in the list. If c is greater than 9, say 10, then the median is (9 + 10)/2 = 9.5, which isn't an integer, contradicting the condition that the median is an integer. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a and c are 9. Then the list would be [9, b, 9, d]. The median is (b + 9)/2. For this to be an integer, b must be odd if 9 is odd, but 9 is odd, so b must be odd as well. Let's say b is 7, then the median is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is an integer not in the list. Then d would be 30 - 9 - 9 -7 = 5. But then the list would be [5,7,9,9], but sorted it's [5,7,9,9]. The median is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list. The mode is 9, which appears twice, and 5 and 7 appear once. So that works.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum is 5 +7 +9 +9 = 30. The mode is 9, which is unique. The median is 8, which is not in the list. So this seems to satisfy all conditions. So n=4 is possible.\n\nBut let's check if 9 appears more than any other number. In this case, 9 appears twice, and the others appear once, so yes, 9 is the unique mode.\n\nSo in this case, the list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares is 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 25 +49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.\n\nBut wait, is this the only possibility? Let me check if there are other possibilities with n=4.\n\nSuppose 9 appears three times. Then the list would have three 9s and one other number. The sum would be 9*3 + x = 27 + x =30 => x=3. So the list would be [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list, contradicting the condition. So 9 can't appear three times in n=4.\n\nAlternatively, if 9 appears once, but that would mean the mode isn't 9, so that's impossible.\n\nSo n=4 seems possible with two 9s, and the other numbers being 5 and7.\n\nBut let's check if n=6 is possible, because maybe there are more 9s, which would affect the sum of squares.\n\nIf n=6, then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. Let's denote the sorted list as [a, b, c, d, e, f]. The median is (c + d)/2, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nThe mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears f times. Since n=6, f must be at least 3 to be the unique mode (because if f=2, another number could also appear twice, making it multimodal). So f must be at least 3.\n\nLet's try f=3. Then the sum contributed by 9s is 27, leaving 30 -27=3 to be distributed among the other three numbers. Since all numbers are positive integers, the other three numbers must be at least 1, but their sum is 3. So the only possibility is three 1s. So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is (1 +9)/2=5, which is an integer not in the list. The mode is 9, which appears three times, and 1 appears three times as well. Wait, that's a problem because then we have two modes: 1 and 9, each appearing three times. But the problem states that the mode is unique, so this is invalid.\n\nSo f=3 doesn't work because it would make 1 and 9 both modes.\n\nWhat if f=4? Then the sum from 9s is 36, which is more than 30, so that's impossible.\n\nWait, 9*4=36, which is already more than 30, so f can't be 4.\n\nSo f=3 is the maximum possible for n=6, but that leads to a conflict with the mode being unique. Therefore, n=6 is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. If f=3, the other three numbers sum to 3, which can only be three 1s. So the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. As I said, that's bimodal, which is not allowed. So n=6 is invalid.\n\nWhat about n=5? Wait, n must be even because the median is the average of two numbers, which is an integer not in the list. If n=5, the median is the 3rd term, which must be an integer not in the list. But if n=5, the median is the 3rd term, which is part of the list, so that contradicts the condition that the median is not in the list. So n must be even, so n=4 is the only possibility.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n=4, as I found earlier, the list could be [5,7,9,9], sum 30, mode 9, median 8 not in the list. That works.\n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities with n=4. For example, could 9 appear three times? As I saw earlier, that would require the fourth number to be 3, making the list [3,9,9,9], but then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list, so that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, could 9 appear twice, and the other two numbers be different? For example, [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30. The median is (8 +9)/2=8.5, which isn't an integer, so that doesn't work. So the median must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd.\n\nIn the case of [5,7,9,9], the two middle numbers are 7 and9, both odd, so their average is 8, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nAnother possibility: [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 6+6+9+9=30. The median is (6 +9)/2=7.5, which isn't an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nWait, but 6 and9 average to 7.5, which isn't integer, so that doesn't work.\n\nWhat about [4,10,9,9]? Sum is 4+10+9+9=32, which is too much. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, I need the sum to be exactly 30. So let's see, if I have two 9s, the other two numbers must sum to 12. Let's list all pairs of positive integers that sum to 12:\n\n1 and11\n\n2 and10\n\n3 and9\n\n4 and8\n\n5 and7\n\n6 and6\n\nBut we need the two middle numbers to be such that their average is an integer not in the list.\n\nLet's check each pair:\n\n1 and11: sorted list would be [1,9,9,11]. Median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.\n\n2 and10: sorted list [2,9,9,10]. Median (9 +9)/2=9, in the list. Invalid.\n\n3 and9: sorted list [3,9,9,9]. Median (9 +9)/2=9, in the list. Invalid.\n\n4 and8: sorted list [4,8,9,9]. Median (8 +9)/2=8.5, not integer. Invalid.\n\n5 and7: sorted list [5,7,9,9]. Median (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list. This works.\n\n6 and6: sorted list [6,6,9,9]. Median (6 +9)/2=7.5, not integer. Invalid.\n\nSo the only valid pair is 5 and7, making the list [5,7,9,9]. So that's the only possibility for n=4.\n\nTherefore, the list must be [5,7,9,9], and the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other possibilities with n=4. For example, could the two middle numbers be 8 and8? But then the list would have two 8s and two 9s, but then the mode would be both 8 and9, which contradicts the unique mode. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, could the two middle numbers be 7 and9, as in the case above, giving a median of8, which is not in the list. That's the only valid case.\n\nSo I think the only possible list is [5,7,9,9], and the sum of squares is 236.\n\nWait", "answer": "236"}

The conditions are that when you read the numbers from left to right in each row, their sum should be 999, and when you read the numbers from top to bottom in each column, their sum should be 99. The example given is a grid where the first row is 0, 0, 8 and the second row is 9, 9, 1. So, 008 + 991 = 999 and 0+9, 0+9, 8+1 = 9, 9, 9, which sums up to 99. \n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Let me denote the grid as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\na & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\nd & e & f \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo, the first row is a, b, c and the second row is d, e, f. \n\nThe problem states that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. So, the first number is the three-digit number formed by a, b, c, which is 100a + 10b + c. The second number is the three-digit number formed by d, e, f, which is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum is 999. So, we have:\n\n100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom in each column is 99. Each column is a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. Their sum is 99:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nLet me write these equations more clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\n\nEquation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nI can try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.\n\nLet me subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\n(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n100a - 10a + 10b - 10b + c - 10c + 100d - d + 10e - e + f - f\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n90a - 9c + 99d + 9e = 900\n\nI can factor out 9:\n\n9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nSo, Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nNow, let's look back at Equation 2:\n\n10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\n\nI can rearrange this as:\n\n10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. Then, Equation 2 becomes:\n\n10S + T = 99\n\nSo, T = 99 - 10S\n\nSince S and T are sums of digits, each digit is between 0 and 9. So, S is the sum of three digits, so S can be from 0 to 27. Similarly, T is the sum of three digits, so T can be from 0 to 27.\n\nBut from T = 99 - 10S, since T must be non-negative, 99 - 10S ≥ 0 => S ≤ 9.9. Since S is an integer, S ≤ 9.\n\nAlso, since T must be at least 0, 99 - 10S ≥ 0 => S ≤ 9.\n\nSo, S can be from 0 to 9.\n\nBut let's think about the possible values of S. Since S is the sum of three digits, each from 0 to 9, the minimum S is 0 (if all are 0) and maximum is 27. But in this case, S must be ≤9.\n\nSo, S ∈ {0,1,2,...,9}\n\nSimilarly, T = 99 - 10S, so T must be between 99 - 10*9 = 9 and 99 - 10*0 = 99. But T is the sum of three digits, so T can be at most 27. Therefore, 99 - 10S ≤ 27 => 10S ≥ 72 => S ≥ 7.2. Since S is integer, S ≥ 8.\n\nSo, combining S ≤9 and S ≥8, S can be 8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, S ∈ {8,9}\n\nSo, S = 8 or 9.\n\nCase 1: S = 8\n\nThen, T = 99 - 10*8 = 19\n\nCase 2: S = 9\n\nThen, T = 99 - 10*9 = 9\n\nSo, we have two cases: S=8, T=19 and S=9, T=9.\n\nNow, let's consider each case.\n\nFirst, let's handle Case 1: S=8, T=19.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 8\n\nd + e + f = 19\n\nAlso, from Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nWe need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) satisfying these conditions.\n\nLet me note that a and d are the first digits of the three-digit numbers, so they can be 0? Wait, in the example, the first row starts with 0, so 008 is considered a three-digit number. So, leading zeros are allowed. So, a and d can be 0.\n\nSo, a, d ∈ {0,1,...,9}\n\nSimilarly, b, c, e, f ∈ {0,1,...,9}\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 8\n\n2. d + e + f = 19\n\n3. 10a - c + 11d + e = 100\n\nWe need to find all possible a, b, c, d, e, f satisfying these.\n\nLet me try to express c from equation 1: c = 8 - a - b\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: f = 19 - d - e\n\nNow, substitute c and f into equation 3:\n\n10a - (8 - a - b) + 11d + e = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n10a -8 + a + b + 11d + e = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11a + b + 11d + e = 108\n\nSo, 11a + b + 11d + e = 108\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n11(a + d) + (b + e) = 108\n\nLet me denote X = a + d and Y = b + e\n\nSo, 11X + Y = 108\n\nWe need to find integers X and Y such that:\n\nX = a + d, where a, d ∈ {0,...,9}, so X ∈ {0,...,18}\n\nY = b + e, where b, e ∈ {0,...,9}, so Y ∈ {0,...,18}\n\nAlso, 11X + Y = 108\n\nSo, Y = 108 - 11X\n\nSince Y must be between 0 and 18, inclusive:\n\n0 ≤ 108 - 11X ≤ 18\n\nSo,\n\n108 - 11X ≥ 0 => X ≤ 108/11 ≈9.81 => X ≤9\n\nAnd,\n\n108 - 11X ≤18 => 108 -18 ≤11X =>90 ≤11X => X ≥90/11≈8.18 => X ≥9\n\nSo, X must be 9.\n\nTherefore, X=9, Y=108 -11*9=108-99=9\n\nSo, X=9, Y=9\n\nTherefore, a + d =9 and b + e=9\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\na + d =9\n\nb + e=9\n\nAlso, from equation 1: a + b + c=8 => c=8 -a -b\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f=19 => f=19 -d -e\n\nBut since a + d=9, d=9 -a\n\nSimilarly, b + e=9, so e=9 -b\n\nSo, substitute d=9 -a and e=9 -b into f:\n\nf=19 - (9 -a) - (9 -b) =19 -9 +a -9 +b=1 +a +b\n\nSo, f=1 +a +b\n\nBut f must be a digit, so f ∈ {0,...,9}\n\nTherefore, 1 +a +b ≤9 => a +b ≤8\n\nBut from equation 1: a + b + c=8, so c=8 -a -b\n\nSince c is a digit, c ≥0 => 8 -a -b ≥0 => a +b ≤8\n\nWhich is consistent with the above.\n\nSo, a +b ≤8\n\nAlso, since a and d are digits, a ∈ {0,...,9}, d=9 -a, so d must be ≥0, so a ≤9, which is already satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, b ∈ {0,...,9}, e=9 -b, so e ≥0 => b ≤9, which is also satisfied.\n\nSo, now, let's summarize:\n\nWe have:\n\na + d=9\n\nb + e=9\n\nc=8 -a -b\n\nf=1 +a +b\n\nWith constraints:\n\na, b, c, d, e, f ∈ {0,...,9}\n\nAnd:\n\nc=8 -a -b ≥0 => a +b ≤8\n\nf=1 +a +b ≤9 => a +b ≤8\n\nSo, a +b can be from 0 to8.\n\nSo, for each possible a and b such that a +b ≤8, we can compute c, d, e, f.\n\nBut we also have to ensure that d=9 -a and e=9 -b are digits, which they are as long as a and b are digits.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is equal to the number of pairs (a,b) where a, b are digits (0-9) and a +b ≤8.\n\nSo, how many such pairs are there?\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b ≤8 is equal to the number of solutions to a + b + c' =8, where c' is a slack variable.\n\nWhich is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nBut wait, a and b are digits, so they can be from 0 to9, but since a +b ≤8, the maximum a or b can be is8, so all solutions are valid.\n\nTherefore, there are 45 possible pairs (a,b).\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, a and b are digits, so each can be from0 to9, but with a +b ≤8.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b ≤8, which is indeed 45.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\nFor a=0, b can be 0-8: 9 options\n\na=1, b=0-7:8\n\na=2, b=0-6:7\n\n...\n\na=8, b=0:1\n\nSo, total is 9+8+7+...+1=45.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 45 possible (a,b) pairs.\n\nEach such pair gives a unique grid:\n\na, b, c=8 -a -b\n\nd=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=1 +a +b\n\nSo, each of these 45 pairs gives a valid grid.\n\nBut wait, we need to ensure that c, d, e, f are digits, i.e., between0 and9.\n\nWe already have:\n\nc=8 -a -b ≥0, which is satisfied because a +b ≤8.\n\nc=8 -a -b ≤8, since a +b ≥0.\n\nBut c can be up to8, which is fine.\n\nd=9 -a: since a is from0 to8 (because a +b ≤8, and a is at least0), so d=9 -a is from1 to9.\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b: since b is from0 to8, e=9 -b is from1 to9.\n\nf=1 +a +b: since a +b ≤8, f=1 +a +b ≤9, which is fine.\n\nSo, all digits are valid.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1 (S=8, T=19), we have 45 possible grids.\n\nNow, let's consider Case 2", "answer": "45"}

The variables x, y, and z are positive real numbers. The equations are:\n\n1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nAnd then, after finding that value, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers and find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since all the equations are logarithmic with base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier to handle. That might help me express x, y, and z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Converting this to exponential form, it becomes x/(yz) = 2^(1/2). So, x = yz * 2^(1/2). Let me write that down:\n\nx = yz * √2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Converting that, we get y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). So, y = xz * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:\n\ny = xz * 2^(1/3).\n\nAnd the third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4. Converting, z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). So, z = xy * 2^(1/4). That is:\n\nz = xy * 2^(1/4).\n\nAlright, so now I have three equations:\n\n1. x = yz * √2\n2. y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3. z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of a single variable or find a relationship between them.\n\nLet me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, x = yz√2. Plugging this into equation 2:\n\ny = (yz√2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = y z² √2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nWait, so y is on both sides. Let me divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it's non-zero):\n\n1 = z² √2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nSo, z² = 1 / (√2 * 2^(1/3))\n\nLet me compute √2 * 2^(1/3). √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying by 2^(1/3) gives 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). Therefore, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). So, z = 2^(-5/12). Because z is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me write that down.\n\nNow, let's find z. So, z = 2^(-5/12). Hmm, okay. Now, let's try to find y.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = xz * 2^(1/3). But I don't know x yet. Maybe I can express x in terms of y and z from equation 1: x = yz√2. So, substituting into equation 2:\n\ny = (yz√2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nWait, that's the same as before, which led us to z². So, maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since I have z, maybe I can find x and y in terms of z.\n\nWait, let's see. From equation 1: x = yz√2. From equation 3: z = xy * 2^(1/4). So, substituting x from equation 1 into equation 3:\n\nz = (yz√2) * y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = y² z √2 * 2^(1/4)\n\nAgain, z is positive, so we can divide both sides by z:\n\n1 = y² √2 * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, y² = 1 / (√2 * 2^(1/4)) = 1 / (2^(1/2) * 2^(1/4)) = 1 / 2^(3/4) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Now, let's find x.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = yz√2. We have y = 2^(-3/8) and z = 2^(-5/12). So, let's compute yz:\n\nyz = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12). Let's compute the exponent:\n\n-3/8 -5/12. To add these, find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24. So, total exponent is -19/24.\n\nTherefore, yz = 2^(-19/24). Then, x = yz√2 = 2^(-19/24) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(-19/24 + 12/24) = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write them with exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-9/24) [since 3/8 = 9/24]\n\nz = 2^(-10/24) [since 5/12 = 10/24]\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let's compute x⁴y³z² first.\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny³ = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz² = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, x⁴y³z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nWhen multiplying exponents with the same base, we add the exponents:\n\nTotal exponent = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: that's (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, add -9/8: -2 - 9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = -25/8.\n\nSo, x⁴y³z² = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nSince we're taking the absolute value, |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime. Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x⁴ = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6). Correct.\n\ny = 2^(-9/24), so y³ = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8). Correct.\n\nz = 2^(-10/24), so z² = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6). Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, (-7/6) + (-5/6) = (-12/6) = -2.\n\nThen, -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25/8). Correct.\n\nSo, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.\n\nHmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, but the angles can vary. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That's an important property.\n\nNow, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine extending these sides, they meet at some points to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate these lengths to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it might be similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal. In a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, but here it's just equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, so it's a more general case.\n\nI think I can model this hexagon as being made up of vectors. Since opposite sides are parallel, the vectors representing the sides will be equal in direction but possibly different in magnitude. Wait, but it's equilateral, so all sides have the same length. So, each side can be represented as vectors with the same magnitude but different directions.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA has length 's'.\n\nSince opposite sides are parallel, the vectors AB and DE are equal in direction, BC and EF are equal in direction, and CD and FA are equal in direction.\n\nWait, but in a hexagon, the sides are connected, so the sum of the vectors should be zero because it's a closed shape. So, AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0.\n\nBut since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. So, AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA in direction, but since it's a hexagon, the directions are opposite? Wait, no, in a convex hexagon, opposite sides are parallel but in the same direction? Or opposite direction?\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and in the same direction. So, if AB is going from A to B, then DE is going from D to E, which is in the same direction as AB. So, vectors AB and DE are equal in direction and magnitude.\n\nBut in this case, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides have the same length, but the angles can vary. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA have the same magnitude 's' but different directions.\n\nSince opposite sides are parallel, the vectors AB and DE are equal, BC and EF are equal, CD and FA are equal. So, AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA as vectors.\n\nTherefore, the sum AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = AB + BC + CD + AB + BC + CD = 2(AB + BC + CD) = 0.\n\nSo, AB + BC + CD = 0.\n\nThat's an important equation. So, the sum of vectors AB, BC, and CD is zero.\n\nNow, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how these extensions form a triangle.\n\nIf I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at some points to form a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD extensions, Q is the intersection of CD and EF extensions, and R is the intersection of EF and AB extensions.\n\nWait, but actually, since AB, CD, and EF are being extended, their extensions will meet at three points forming a triangle. Let me try to figure out the relationship between the sides of this triangle and the hexagon.\n\nSince AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions will form the sides of the triangle. The lengths of the triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, the sides of triangle PQR are 200, 240, and 300.\n\nI need to relate these lengths to the side length 's' of the hexagon.\n\nMaybe I can use similar triangles or some proportionality.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions might be similar to some triangles within the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the hexagon as a combination of vectors and use the triangle's side lengths to find 's'.\n\nLet me consider the vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. As I mentioned earlier, AB + BC + CD = 0.\n\nSo, AB + BC + CD = 0.\n\nLet me denote vector AB as vector a, BC as vector b, and CD as vector c. Then, a + b + c = 0.\n\nSo, c = - (a + b).\n\nNow, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about the directions of these sides.\n\nSince AB is vector a, CD is vector c, and EF is vector f. But since EF is opposite to BC, which is vector b, so EF is equal to vector b in direction. Wait, no, EF is opposite to BC, so EF is equal in direction to BC, but in the opposite direction? Wait, no, in a convex hexagon, opposite sides are parallel but in the same direction.\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and in the same direction. So, if AB is going from A to B, then DE is going from D to E, which is in the same direction as AB. Similarly, BC is from B to C, and EF is from E to F, which is in the same direction as BC.\n\nSo, vector EF is equal to vector BC, which is vector b.\n\nSimilarly, vector CD is equal to vector FA, which is vector c.\n\nWait, but earlier I had AB + BC + CD = 0, so a + b + c = 0.\n\nSo, if I can express the sides of the triangle in terms of vectors a, b, c, maybe I can find the relationship.\n\nThe triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, the sides of the triangle are along the directions of vectors a, c, and b.\n\nWait, but the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300. So, perhaps the lengths of these sides are proportional to the magnitudes of vectors a, b, c?\n\nBut vectors a, b, c have the same magnitude 's', but different directions.\n\nWait, but the triangle is formed by the extensions, so the lengths of the triangle's sides might be related to the distances between the lines extended from AB, CD, and EF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is similar to the triangle formed by vectors a, b, c.\n\nWait, since a + b + c = 0, the triangle formed by vectors a, b, c is a triangle with sides of length |a|, |b|, |c|, which are all equal to 's'. So, that would be an equilateral triangle, but the given triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, which is a scalene triangle.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the hexagon as being composed of three pairs of parallel sides. Each pair is separated by some distance. The triangle formed by extending these sides would have sides proportional to these distances.\n\nWait, in a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides can be related to the side length and the angles between the sides.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are length 's', but the angles can vary. So, the distances between opposite sides would depend on the angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms.\n\nWait, if opposite sides are parallel, then the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms, each formed by a pair of opposite sides.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another idea: since the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, which are three non-consecutive sides, each separated by one side.\n\nIn a convex hexagon, extending these sides would form a triangle outside the hexagon. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300.\n\nI think I can use the concept of similar triangles here. The triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, but scaled by some factor.\n\nWait, but the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but the triangle is scalene. So, maybe the triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the vectors a, b, c, but scaled.\n\nWait, earlier I had a + b + c = 0, so the triangle formed by vectors a, b, c is a triangle with sides |a|, |b|, |c|, which are all 's', so it's an equilateral triangle. But the given triangle is scalene, so that might not be directly similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle formed by the extensions is related to the hexagon's geometry in a different way.\n\nLet me try to think about the ratios. The triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if this is a right triangle.\n\n200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600\n\n300^2 = 90000\n\nNo, 97600 ≠ 90000, so it's not a right triangle. Wait, actually, 200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, which is less than 300^2 = 90000? Wait, no, 97600 is more than 90000. Wait, 200^2 + 240^2 = 97600, which is more than 300^2 = 90000, so it's an acute triangle.\n\nWait, actually, 200, 240, 300: Let me check 200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, and 300^2 = 90000. So, 97600 > 90000, so the triangle is acute.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of the triangle's sides being proportional to the distances between the opposite sides of the hexagon.\n\nIn a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides can be calculated using the side length and the angles.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are length 's', but the angles can vary. So, the distances between opposite sides would depend on the angles.\n\nLet me denote the distances between AB and DE as h1, between BC and EF as h2, and between CD and FA as h3.\n\nThen, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF would have sides proportional to h1, h2, h3.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides of the triangle are proportional to the lengths of the sides of the hexagon times some trigonometric functions of the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms, each with sides 's' and some height, and the triangle formed by the extensions would have sides equal to the sums of these heights.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it can be inscribed in a rectangle or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and try to express the sides and the triangle.\n\nLet me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AB is a side of length 's', let me assume AB is along the x-axis, so point B is at (s, 0).\n\nNow, since opposite sides are parallel, DE is parallel to AB, so DE is also horizontal. Similarly, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points as follows:\n\nA: (0, 0)\n\nB: (s, 0)\n\nC: (s + x, y)\n\nD: (x, y + z)\n\nE: (0, z)\n\nF: (w, 0)\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but let me try.\n\nSince BC is parallel to EF, the vector BC should be equal to the vector EF.\n\nVector BC is from B(s,0) to C(s + x, y), so it's (x, y).\n\nVector EF is from E(0,z) to F(w,0), so it's (w, -z).\n\nSince BC is parallel to EF, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of BC and EF are equal to 's'.\n\nSo, |BC| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = s\n\n|EF| = sqrt(w^2 + z^2) = s\n\nAlso, since BC is parallel to EF, the vectors (x, y) and (w, -z) must be scalar multiples. So, (w, -z) = k*(x, y) for some scalar k.\n\nBut since both vectors have the same magnitude, sqrt(w^2 + z^2) = sqrt(k^2 x^2 + k^2 y^2) = |k| * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = |k| * s.\n\nBut |EF| = s, so |k| * s = s => |k| = 1. So, k = 1 or -1.\n\nIf k = 1, then w = x and -z = y => z = -y.\n\nBut since the hexagon is convex, all the y-coordinates should be positive if we're moving counterclockwise. So, z = -y would make z negative, which might not be convex. Alternatively, if k = -1, then w = -x and -z = -y => z = y.\n\nSo, w = -x and z = y.\n\nSo, vector EF is (-x, -y). But since EF is from E(0,z) to F(w,0), which is (w, -z) =", "answer": "80"}

Nájdite súčet prvkov množiny $A$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob writes down all the finite non-empty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list contains 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements in set A.\n\nHmm, let me try to understand this step by step. So, Alice picks some set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob is creating all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum number in B is one of the numbers in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My job is to figure out what A is, or at least the sum of its elements.\n\nFirst, let me think about how Bob is generating these sets B. For each element a in A, Bob is considering all possible non-empty subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a} where the maximum element is exactly a. Because if the maximum is a, then all other elements in B must be less than or equal to a, but since a is the maximum, they must be less than a.\n\nWait, actually, no. If the maximum is a, then the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right? Because if you include a, then the maximum is a, and the other elements can be any combination of numbers less than a. So for each a in A, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, which is 2^{a-1}. But since B has to be non-empty, we subtract 1? Wait, no, because each B must include a, so actually, for each a, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any subset of the numbers less than a, and then include a in the set. So the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If a is 1, then the only set is {1}, so 2^{0} = 1, which is correct. If a is 2, then the sets are {2}, {1,2}, so 2^{1} = 2, which is correct. If a is 3, the sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, which is 4 sets, so 2^{2} = 4. Yeah, that seems right. So for each a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is 2^{a-1}.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sets Bob writes down is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. And this total is given as 2024. So, we have:\n\nSum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024\n\nSo, I need to find a set A of positive integers such that when I take each a in A, compute 2^{a - 1}, and sum them all up, I get 2024.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, but shifted by one exponent. Because 2^{a - 1} is just 2^{k} where k = a - 1. So, if I let k = a - 1, then a = k + 1, and the sum becomes Sum_{k} 2^{k} where k = a - 1 for a in A.\n\nBut wait, 2024 is a specific number. Let me see if I can express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Because each term 2^{a - 1} must be unique since each a is unique (as A is a set). So, A must consist of distinct positive integers, so each 2^{a - 1} is a distinct power of 2.\n\nTherefore, 2024 must be equal to the sum of some distinct powers of 2. So, let me try to express 2024 in binary, because binary representation is essentially the sum of powers of 2.\n\nLet me compute 2024 in binary.\n\nFirst, let's find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2024.\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^11 = 2048, which is larger than 2024, so the highest power is 2^10.\n\n2024 - 1024 = 1000\n\nNow, the next highest power less than 1000 is 512 (2^9).\n\n1000 - 512 = 488\n\nNext, 256 (2^8).\n\n488 - 256 = 232\n\nNext, 128 (2^7).\n\n232 - 128 = 104\n\nNext, 64 (2^6).\n\n104 - 64 = 40\n\nNext, 32 (2^5).\n\n40 - 32 = 8\n\nNext, 8 is 2^3.\n\n8 - 8 = 0.\n\nSo, the binary representation is 11111101000.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^9 = 512\n\n2^8 = 256\n\n2^7 = 128\n\n2^6 = 64\n\n2^5 = 32\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nSo, adding these up: 1024 + 512 = 1536; 1536 + 256 = 1792; 1792 + 128 = 1920; 1920 + 64 = 1984; 1984 + 32 = 2016; 2016 + 8 = 2024. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which corresponds to the exponents 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3.\n\nWait, let me count the positions. Starting from the right, the bits are:\n\nPosition: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nBits:      1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo, the bits set are at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3.\n\nTherefore, 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.\n\nSo, in terms of the original problem, each term 2^{a - 1} corresponds to a power of 2. So, if 2^{a - 1} = 2^k, then a - 1 = k, so a = k + 1.\n\nTherefore, the exponents k are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3. So, the corresponding a's are 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor k=10: a=11\n\nk=9: a=10\n\nk=8: a=9\n\nk=7: a=8\n\nk=6: a=7\n\nk=5: a=6\n\nk=3: a=4\n\nSo, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.\n\nTherefore, the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nSo, the sum of the elements in A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\n10 + 7 = 17\n\n17 + 8 = 25\n\n25 + 9 = 34\n\n34 + 10 = 44\n\n44 + 11 = 55\n\nSo, the sum is 55.\n\nWait, let me double-check the addition:\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\n10 + 7 = 17\n\n17 + 8 = 25\n\n25 + 9 = 34\n\n34 + 10 = 44\n\n44 + 11 = 55\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the elements in A is 55.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me recap:\n\nWe have Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.\n\nExpressed 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.\n\nEach term 2^{a - 1} corresponds to a power of 2, so a - 1 must be the exponents, so a = exponent + 1.\n\nThus, exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.\n\nSum of a's: 11+10+9+8+7+6+4.\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought the a's were 4,6,7,8,9,10,11, which is the same as 4,6,7,8,9,10,11. So, adding them up: 4+6=10, 10+7=17, 17+8=25, 25+9=34, 34+10=44, 44+11=55. So, yes, 55.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any exponents. The binary representation was 11111101000, which is 11 bits. Let me count the positions again:\n\nStarting from the right, position 0 is the least significant bit.\n\nSo, the bits set are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo, exponents k are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nTherefore, a = k + 1: 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum is 55.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the elements in set \\( A \\) is \\boxed{55}.\n</think>\n\nAlice chooses a set \\( A \\) of positive integers. Bob then writes down all finite non-empty sets \\( B \\) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \\( B \\) is in \\( A \\). The total number of such sets \\( B \\) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in set \\( A \\).\n\nFor each element \\( a \\) in \\( A \\), the number of sets \\( B \\) where the maximum element is \\( a \\) is \\( 2^{a-1} \\). Therefore, the total number of sets Bob writes down is the sum of \\( 2^{a-1} \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( A \\). This sum is given as 2024.\n\nWe express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2:\n\\[ 2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \\]\n\nEach term \\( 2^{a-1} \\) corresponds to a power of 2, so \\( a - 1 \\) must be the exponents. Therefore, the elements \\( a \\) in \\( A \\) are:\n\\[ a = 10 + 1, 9 + 1, 8 + 1, 7 + 1, 6 + 1, 5 + 1, 3 + 1 \\]\n\\[ a = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4 \\]\n\nThe set \\( A \\) is \\{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}. The sum of the elements in \\( A \\) is:\n\\[ 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the elements in set \\( A \\) is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).", "answer": "55"}

Nájdite $Q+R$.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest four-digit positive integer N with a special property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number becomes divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then compute Q + R.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.\n\nLet me denote the four-digit number N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.\n\nNow, the condition is that changing any one digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. That means:\n\n1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD should be divisible by 7.\n2. Changing B to 1: A1CD should be divisible by 7.\n3. Changing C to 1: AB1D should be divisible by 7.\n4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 should be divisible by 7.\n\nSo, I need to find the largest four-digit number N such that all four of these conditions hold.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest such number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies all four conditions.\n\nBut checking each number one by one might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the divisibility by 7. A number is divisible by 7 if, when you subtract twice the last digit from the rest of the number, the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if that rule will help here directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express each condition mathematically and find constraints on A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.\n\n1. When A is changed to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This should be divisible by 7.\n\n2. When B is changed to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. This should be divisible by 7.\n\n3. When C is changed to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. This should be divisible by 7.\n\n4. When D is changed to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. This should be divisible by 7.\n\nSo, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.\n\nLet me write these congruences:\n\n1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nNow, let me compute the coefficients modulo 7 to simplify these equations.\n\nFirst, compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.\n\n1000 / 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n\n100 / 7: 7*14=98, so 100 - 98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\n10 / 7: 10 - 7=3. So, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\n1 mod 7 is 1.\n\nSo, substituting these into the equations:\n\n1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7\n4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, now we have four congruences:\n\n1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  --> Let's call this Equation (1)\n2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  --> Equation (2)\n3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7  --> Equation (3)\n4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7  --> Equation (4)\n\nNow, let's see if we can express these equations in terms of each other or find relationships between A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):\n\nEquation (2) - Equation (1):\n\n(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A + 2 + 3C + D - 6 - 2B - 3C - D ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n6A - 2B + (2 - 6) ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nWhich is:\n\n6A - 2B - 4 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nWe can factor out 2:\n\n2*(3A - B) ≡ 4 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):\n\n3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nSo, 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (5).\n\nSimilarly, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) - Equation (1):\n\n(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A + 2B + 3 + D - 6 - 2B - 3C - D ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n6A - 3C + (3 - 6) ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nWhich is:\n\n6A - 3C - 3 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nFactor out 3:\n\n3*(2A - C) - 3 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nWait, maybe better to write as:\n\n6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7\n\nDivide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):\n\n2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nSo, 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (6).\n\nNow, let's subtract Equation (2) from Equation (4):\n\nEquation (4) - Equation (2):\n\n(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A + 2B + 3C + 1 - 6A - 2 - 3C - D ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n2B - D - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (7).\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):\n\nEquation (4) - Equation (3):\n\n(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n6A + 2B + 3C + 1 - 6A - 2B - 3 - D ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n3C - D - 2 ≡ 0 mod 7\n\nSo, 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (8).\n\nNow, let's summarize the equations we have:\n\nEquation (5): 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nEquation (6): 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nEquation (7): 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7\n\nEquation (8): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7\n\nSo, we have four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me see if I can express B, C, D in terms of A.\n\nFrom Equation (5): 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7 => B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7\n\nFrom Equation (6): 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7 => C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7\n\nFrom Equation (7): 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7 => D ≡ 2B - 1 mod 7\n\nFrom Equation (8): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7 => D ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7\n\nSo, from Equations (7) and (8), we have two expressions for D:\n\nD ≡ 2B - 1 mod 7\n\nD ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7\n\nTherefore, 2B - 1 ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n2B - 3C ≡ -1 mod 7 => 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nBut from Equations (5) and (6), we have expressions for B and C in terms of A.\n\nFrom Equation (5): B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7\n\nFrom Equation (6): C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7\n\nSo, substitute B and C into 2B - 3C:\n\n2*(3A - 2) - 3*(2A - 1) ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nCompute:\n\n6A - 4 - 6A + 3 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n(6A - 6A) + (-4 + 3) ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nWhich is:\n\n0A -1 ≡ 6 mod 7\n\nSo, -1 ≡ 6 mod 7, which is true because -1 + 7 = 6.\n\nSo, this doesn't give us any new information. It just confirms that our previous equations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can proceed to express B, C, D in terms of A.\n\nSo, let's write:\n\nB = (3A - 2) mod 7\n\nC = (2A - 1) mod 7\n\nD = (2B - 1) mod 7\n\nBut since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), we need to find A such that B, C, D are digits (0-9). Also, since N is a four-digit number, A must be from 1 to 9.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest N, so we should start with A=9 and work our way down until we find a valid N.\n\nLet me start with A=9.\n\nCompute B, C, D:\n\nB = (3*9 - 2) mod 7 = (27 - 2) mod 7 = 25 mod 7. 25 /7=3*7=21, 25-21=4. So, B=4.\n\nC = (2*9 -1) mod 7 = (18 -1) mod 7=17 mod7=3 (since 14 is 2*7, 17-14=3). So, C=3.\n\nD = (2*B -1) mod7= (2*4 -1)=8-1=7 mod7=0. So, D=0.\n\nSo, with A=9, we have B=4, C=3, D=0. So, N=9430.\n\nBut we need to check if changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but before that, let me check if these values satisfy all four original congruences.\n\nLet me compute each condition:\n\n1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD=1430. Check if 1430 is divisible by 7.\n\n1430 /7: 7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30. 30/7≈4.28, so 1430=7*204 + 2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible by 7. So, this doesn't satisfy condition 1.\n\nHmm, so N=9430 doesn't satisfy the first condition. Therefore, A=9 is invalid.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier equations, it should satisfy all conditions. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nA=9:\n\nB=(3*9 -2)=27-2=25. 25 mod7=4, correct.\n\nC=(2*9 -1)=18-1=17. 17 mod7=3, correct.\n\nD=(2*4 -1)=8-1=7. 7 mod7=0, correct.\n\nSo, N=9430.\n\nNow, check condition 1: changing A to 1: 1430.\n\n1430 divided by 7: 7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30", "answer": "699"}

Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but at a distance of 6 units from the center of the circle. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) of 6 and a minor radius (the radius of the tube) of 3.\n\nThen there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T is placed on the outside of the sphere, and it's externally tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i. When the torus is on the inside of the sphere, it's also externally tangent along another circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe I don't need that here. Instead, I should think about the geometry of the situation.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii if they are externally tangent. Wait, but the torus isn't a solid; it's a surface. So, maybe I need to think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus.\n\nWait, the torus is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the center of the generating circle. So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle, which is also the center of the tube.\n\nBut when the torus is placed on the outside of the sphere, the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus must be such that the torus is externally tangent. Similarly, when it's on the inside, the distance is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this in coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the center of the torus T is somewhere along, say, the z-axis. Let's say the center of the torus is at (0,0,d), where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus.\n\nNow, the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, but wait, no. Wait, the generating circle is in a plane, and the axis is in that plane, 6 units away from the center. So, if I imagine the generating circle lying in the x-y plane, centered at (6,0,0), and rotating around the z-axis, which is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle.\n\nWait, no, actually, the generating circle is in a plane, and the axis is in that plane, 6 units away from the center. So, if the generating circle is in the x-y plane, its center is at (6,0,0), and it's being rotated around the z-axis, which is 6 units away. So, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.\n\nSo, the torus can be represented parametrically as:\n\nx = (R + r cos θ) cos φ\n\ny = (R + r cos θ) sin φ\n\nz = r sin θ\n\nwhere θ and φ are angles from 0 to 2π.\n\nBut maybe I don't need the parametric equations. Instead, I should think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their \"radii\" in some sense. But the torus isn't a sphere, so it's a bit more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the closest and farthest points on the torus from the center of the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, so if the torus is externally tangent, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center must be 11 units away. Similarly, when the torus is internally tangent, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center must be 11 units away.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is 11 units away. When it's internally tangent, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is 11 units away.\n\nSo, let's denote the center of the sphere as O, and the center of the torus as C. The distance between O and C is D.\n\nFor the external tangent case, the closest point on the torus to O is along the line connecting O and C. The closest point on the torus would be on the inner side of the torus, right? So, the distance from O to that closest point is D - (R - r), where R is the major radius (6) and r is the minor radius (3). So, D - (6 - 3) = D - 3.\n\nBut this distance should be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11. So, D - 3 = 11, which gives D = 14.\n\nWait, but hold on. If the torus is externally tangent, the closest point on the torus is 11 units from O. So, the distance from O to C is D, and the closest point on the torus is D - (R - r). So, D - (6 - 3) = D - 3 = 11, so D = 14.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is internally tangent, the farthest point on the torus from O is 11 units away. The farthest point on the torus would be on the outer side, so the distance from O to that point is D + (R + r). So, D + (6 + 3) = D + 9 = 11, so D = 2.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. If D is 14 in one case and 2 in the other, but the center of the torus can't be both 14 and 2 units away from the sphere's center. Maybe I have this backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps when the torus is externally tangent, the distance from O to C is D = 11 + (R - r) = 11 + 3 = 14. And when it's internally tangent, the distance is D = 11 - (R + r) = 11 - 9 = 2. That makes sense because when the torus is outside, the center is farther away, and when it's inside, the center is closer.\n\nSo, in the external tangent case, D = 14, and in the internal tangent case, D = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the radii r_i and r_o of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in each case.\n\nWait, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, the circle of tangency lies on both the torus and the sphere. So, the radius of this circle can be found by considering the cross-section.\n\nLet me think about the cross-section of the torus and sphere. If we take a cross-section through the z-axis, the torus would appear as two circles of radius 3, centered at (6,0) and (-6,0), but wait, no. Wait, in the cross-section, the torus would look like a circle of radius 3, but offset by 6 units from the origin.\n\nWait, actually, in the cross-section, the torus would appear as a circle of radius 3, whose center is at (6,0). So, the cross-section is a circle with center at (6,0) and radius 3.\n\nSimilarly, the sphere in cross-section is a circle with radius 11 centered at (0,0).\n\nSo, when the torus is externally tangent, the distance between centers is 14, and when it's internally tangent, the distance is 2.\n\nWait, but in the cross-section, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0). So, when the torus is externally tangent, the distance between centers is 14, which is 11 + 3, so they are externally tangent. Similarly, when the distance is 2, which is 11 - 3, they are internally tangent.\n\nBut in the problem, the torus is placed on the outside of the sphere, so the distance between centers is 14, and on the inside, it's 2.\n\nNow, the circle of tangency in each case is the set of points where the sphere and the torus meet. In the cross-section, this would be the points where the two circles intersect. Since they are tangent, they intersect at exactly one point in the cross-section, but in 3D, this corresponds to a circle.\n\nWait, but in the cross-section, the tangent point is a single point, but in 3D, the torus is a surface of revolution, so the tangent circle would be a circle in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the cross-section. Let me consider the cross-section in the plane containing the z-axis and the center of the generating circle. So, in this cross-section, the torus is represented by a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0). The sphere is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0,0).\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent, the distance between centers is 14, so the two circles are externally tangent. The point of tangency is along the line connecting their centers, which is the x-axis. So, the point of tangency is at (11,0) for the sphere and (6 + 3, 0) = (9,0) for the torus. Wait, but 6 + 3 is 9, which is less than 11, so that can't be.\n\nWait, no, if the distance between centers is 14, then the point of tangency is at (11,0) for the sphere, which is 11 units from (0,0), and for the torus, it's 3 units from (6,0). So, 6 + 3 = 9, but 9 is not 11. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. If the distance between centers is 14, then the point of tangency is along the line connecting (0,0) and (6,0). So, the point on the sphere is at (11,0), and the point on the torus is at (6 + 3*(11 - 6)/14, 0). Wait, that might not be the right way.\n\nWait, actually, when two circles are externally tangent, the point of tangency lies along the line connecting their centers, at a distance of R from each center. So, for the sphere, the point is at (11,0), and for the torus, the point is at (6 + 3,0) = (9,0). But 9 is not equal to 11, so that can't be. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the distance between centers is not 14. Let me think again.\n\nIf the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is externally tangent, then the distance between centers should be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the maximum distance from the torus's center to the sphere's surface. Wait, no, the torus is a surface, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center should be equal to the sphere's radius plus the minimum distance from the torus's center to the sphere's surface.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the formula for the distance between the centers when two surfaces are tangent.\n\nFor two surfaces to be tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent.\n\nBut the torus isn't a sphere, so it's more complicated. Maybe I need to find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center such that the sphere is tangent to the torus.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface and find the condition for tangency.\n\nThe equation of the torus can be written in 3D as:\n\n√( ( √(x² + y²) - R )² + z² ) = r\n\nwhere R is the major radius (6) and r is the minor radius (3). So, plugging in, we get:\n\n√( ( √(x² + y²) - 6 )² + z² ) = 3\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n( √(x² + y²) - 6 )² + z² = 9\n\nExpanding:\n\n(x² + y²) - 12√(x² + y²) + 36 + z² = 9\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + y² + z² - 12√(x² + y²) + 36 = 9\n\nx² + y² + z² - 12√(x² + y²) + 27 = 0\n\nNow, the sphere S has equation x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.\n\nSo, substituting x² + y² + z² = 121 into the torus equation:\n\n121 - 12√(x² + y²) + 27 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n148 - 12√(x² + y²) = 0\n\n12√(x² + y²) = 148\n\n√(x² + y²) = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 ≈ 12.333...\n\nBut wait, the sphere has radius 11, so √(x² + y²) can't be more than 11. But 37/3 is approximately 12.333, which is greater than 11. That can't be. So, this suggests that there's no solution, which can't be right because the problem states that the torus is tangent to the sphere.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check.\n\nThe torus equation is:\n\n√( ( √(x² + y²) - 6 )² + z² ) = ", "answer": "127"}

The conditions are that each cell can have at most one token, all tokens in the same row must be the same color, all tokens in the same column must be the same color, and if I add any more tokens, it would violate one of these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the constraints. Each row can have tokens of only one color, and each column can also have tokens of only one color. So, if I have a token in a particular row, all tokens in that row must be the same color. Similarly, for columns. Also, the grid is 5x5, so there are 25 cells. I have 25 white tokens and 25 black tokens, but I don't have to use all of them. I can use any number, as long as the conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"niektoré z týchto žetónov\", which translates to \"some of these tokens\". So, I can use any number of white and black tokens, but not more than 25 of each. But actually, since the grid is 5x5, the maximum number of tokens I can place is 25, so I can't use more than 25 tokens in total. So, the number of tokens I place can be anywhere from 0 to 25, but with the constraints on the colors in rows and columns.\n\nBut the last condition says that if I add any more tokens, it would violate one of the previous two conditions. So, the configuration I have must be maximal in the sense that I can't add any more tokens without breaking the row or column color constraints. That means that for every empty cell, adding a token there would either conflict with the row's color or the column's color.\n\nSo, I need to count all such maximal configurations where each row is monochromatic, each column is monochromatic, and every empty cell is blocked by either its row or column already having a different color.\n\nLet me think about how such a configuration can look. Since each row must be all white, all black, or empty, and each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But also, the configuration must be maximal, so for every empty cell, either its row is already filled with a color different from what it could be, or its column is filled with a different color.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a matrix where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But with the additional condition that the configuration is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more tokens without violating the row or column constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the configuration is such that for every empty cell, the row is already filled with a color different from the column's color. Because if the row is empty, you could potentially add a token, but if the column is already filled with a different color, you can't. Similarly, if the column is empty, but the row is filled with a different color, you can't add a token.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If a cell is empty, then either its row is already filled with a color, or its column is already filled with a color, but not necessarily different. Wait, no, because if the row is filled with white, and the column is filled with black, then the cell is at the intersection of a white row and a black column, so you can't place a token there because it would conflict with both. But if the row is filled with white and the column is empty, then you could potentially add a white token, but since the column is empty, you could add a white token without conflicting with the column. But wait, the column is empty, so adding a white token would set the column's color to white, but since the row is already white, that's okay. Wait, but the column was empty, so adding a token would set its color, but the row is already white, so the token must be white. So, in that case, you could add a white token, but the problem says that you can't add any more tokens without violating the conditions. So, that would mean that in such a case, the configuration is not maximal because you can add a token.\n\nTherefore, for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must have either its row already filled with a color different from what it could be, or its column already filled with a color different from what it could be. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose I have a cell (i,j) that is empty. If I try to place a token there, it must be either white or black. But if the row i is already filled with white, then I can only place a white token there, but if the column j is already filled with black, then I can't place a white token there because the column would have a different color. Similarly, if the row is filled with black, I can't place a black token if the column is filled with white.\n\nWait, so for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must have either its row filled with a color different from what it could be, or its column filled with a color different from what it could be. So, for each empty cell, either the row is filled with a color that is different from the color that the cell could take, or the column is filled with a color different from the color that the cell could take.\n\nBut actually, the cell could take either color, but if the row is filled with a color, say white, then the cell can only take white. Similarly, if the column is filled with black, the cell can only take black. So, if both the row and column are filled with different colors, the cell cannot take any color, hence it must be empty. If only the row is filled, then the cell can take that color, but if the column is filled with a different color, it can't. Similarly, if only the column is filled, the cell can take that color, but if the row is filled with a different color, it can't.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire grid. Let me consider that each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is either white, black, or empty. But the configuration must be such that for every cell, if the row is non-empty, it's color is fixed, and if the column is non-empty, its color is fixed. So, the intersection of a non-empty row and a non-empty column must have the same color.\n\nWait, that's an important point. If a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, in a valid configuration, for any row and column that are both non-empty, they must have the same color. So, all non-empty rows must have the same color, and all non-empty columns must have the same color, and the color of the rows must equal the color of the columns.\n\nWait, is that necessarily true? Let me think. Suppose I have a row that's white and a column that's black. Their intersection would require a cell to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, such a configuration is invalid. Therefore, in any valid configuration, all non-empty rows must have the same color, and all non-empty columns must have the same color, and the color of the rows must equal the color of the columns.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So, if I have any non-empty rows, they must all be the same color, say color C. Similarly, any non-empty columns must all be the same color, which must also be C. Therefore, the entire configuration is such that all non-empty rows are color C, all non-empty columns are color C, and the intersection of any non-empty row and non-empty column is color C.\n\nTherefore, the configuration is determined by choosing a color C (either white or black), and then choosing a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that the intersection of these rows and columns is non-empty? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, if I choose some rows and some columns, all of color C, then the cells at the intersection of these rows and columns must be color C, but the other cells in the rows and columns can be empty or filled with C.\n\nWait, no, because if a row is non-empty, it must be entirely color C, and if a column is non-empty, it must be entirely color C. So, if I have some rows colored C and some columns colored C, then the intersection cells must be C, but the other cells in the rows and columns can be empty or filled with C. Wait, no, because if a row is non-empty, it must be entirely C, so all cells in that row must be C. Similarly, all cells in a non-empty column must be C.\n\nWait, so if I have some rows colored C and some columns colored C, then the entire grid must be filled with C in the intersection of those rows and columns, but the rest of the grid can be empty or filled with C? No, that's not correct. Because if a row is colored C, all its cells must be C, regardless of the columns. Similarly, if a column is colored C, all its cells must be C, regardless of the rows. Therefore, the intersection of a C row and a C column is C, but if a row is C and a column is empty, then the cell is C. Similarly, if a column is C and a row is empty, the cell is C. Wait, no, if a row is C, all its cells are C, regardless of the column. Similarly, if a column is C, all its cells are C, regardless of the row.\n\nWait, that can't be, because if a row is C and a column is C, their intersection is C, but if a row is C and a column is empty, the cell is C, and if a column is C and a row is empty, the cell is C. So, in fact, the entire grid would be filled with C in all cells that are in any non-empty row or non-empty column. But that would mean that the grid is filled with C in all cells that are in any non-empty row or column, but the rest can be empty.\n\nWait, but if a row is non-empty, it's entirely C, so all cells in that row are C. Similarly, if a column is non-empty, all cells in that column are C. Therefore, the union of all non-empty rows and non-empty columns must be filled with C. But the intersection of a non-empty row and a non-empty column is also C, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the configuration is determined by choosing a color C, and then choosing a set of rows R and a set of columns S, such that the union of R and S covers some cells, and all those cells are C. But wait, no, because if I choose R rows and S columns, then all cells in R rows are C, and all cells in S columns are C. So, the entire grid would have C in all cells that are in R rows or S columns. But the cells not in R rows or S columns can be empty.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each cell can have at most one token, so the cells not in R rows or S columns can be empty or have a token? Wait, no, because if a cell is not in any R row or S column, then it's empty, because if it had a token, it would have to be of some color, but since its row is empty and its column is empty, it could be either color, but the configuration must be maximal, so we can't have such cells because we could add a token there without violating the row or column constraints.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be such that adding a token there would violate either the row or column constraint. Therefore, for every empty cell, either its row is already filled with a color different from what it could be, or its column is filled with a different color.\n\nBut in our case, if a cell is not in any R row or S column, then its row is empty and its column is empty. Therefore, we could add a token there of any color, which would set the row and column to that color. But since the configuration is maximal, we cannot add any more tokens, so such cells cannot exist. Therefore, the entire grid must be covered by the union of R rows and S columns. That is, every cell is either in some R row or some S column.\n\nTherefore, the configuration is such that all cells are in R rows or S columns, and all those cells are colored C. So, the grid is filled with C in all cells that are in R rows or S columns, and the rest are empty. But since the rest are empty, and the configuration is maximal, there are no cells outside R rows and S columns, because otherwise, we could add a token there.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the entire grid must be covered by R rows and S columns. So, the union of R rows and S columns must cover all 25 cells. Therefore, R and S must be such that every cell is in at least one R row or one S column.\n\nSo, in other words, the set of rows R and columns S must form a covering of the grid. That is, every cell is in R or S.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing a color C (white or black), choosing a set of rows R, and a set of columns S, such that every cell is in R or S, and all cells in R rows and S columns are colored C.\n\nBut wait, no, because if a cell is in both R and S, it's still just colored C. So, the entire grid is colored C in all cells that are in R or S, and the rest are empty. But since the configuration is maximal, there are no cells outside R or S, so R and S must cover the entire grid.\n\nTherefore, R and S must form a covering of the grid, meaning that every cell is in at least one R row or one S column.\n\nSo, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose R and S such that R union S covers the grid, multiplied by 2 (for the two colors).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nIf I choose R rows and S columns such that every cell is in R or S, then the entire grid is covered, and all those cells are colored C. Since the configuration is maximal, there are no empty cells, because otherwise, we could add a token there. Wait, but in this case, all cells are covered, so there are no empty cells. Therefore, the entire grid is filled with C.\n\nBut that can't be, because if I have all cells filled with C, then I can't add any more tokens, which is fine, but the problem allows for some tokens, not necessarily all. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, because if R and S cover the entire grid, then all cells are in R or S, so all cells are colored C. Therefore, the entire grid is filled with C, which is a valid configuration, but", "answer": "902"}
