So, Aya goes to the market every morning. She walks 9 kilometers, then stops at the bakery for t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes. Then, if she walks at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes. And we need to find out how long her walk is, including t minutes at the bakery, when she walks at speed s + 1/2 km/h.\n\nHmm. Let me start by breaking down the problem. Let's denote the total time Aya spends walking as T. So, T = 4 hours (including t minutes) when she walks at speed s. Similarly, T = 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) when she walks at speed s+2. And when she walks at speed s + 1/2 km/h, the total time is T + t minutes.\n\nFirst, let's convert all times into minutes to make the calculations easier. Let's convert 4 hours into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. So, T = 240 minutes. Similarly, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2.4 hours, which is 2.4 * 60 = 144 minutes. So, T = 144 minutes. Therefore, T = 240 - t minutes. So, t = 240 - T.\n\nSo, the total time T is 240 - t. Then, when she walks at speed s, the time taken is T = 240 - t. So, 240 - t = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. So, 240 - t = 240. Therefore, t = 0. So, t is 0 minutes. But that can't be right because she stops at the bakery for t minutes. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes strayed at the bakery.\" So, the total time T is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, T = 240 - t. But when she walks at speed s, the time taken is T = 240 - t. So, 240 - t = 240. Therefore, t = 0. But that would mean she doesn't stop at the bakery, which contradicts the problem statement. So, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the total time T is not 240 minutes, but 240 - t minutes. Wait, no. The problem says \"the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes strayed at the bakery.\" So, the total time T is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, T = 240 - t.

The tangent lines at points B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects ω again at point P. We need to find the length of AP in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime integers, and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic triangle. The tangent lines at B and C meet at D, which is the point of tangency. Then, AD intersects the circle again at P. We need to find the length of AP in terms of m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me recall some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and tangent lines. Since ABC is cyclic, the angles subtended by the same chord are equal. Also, the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nSince D is the point of tangency, BD is tangent to the circle at B, so OB is perpendicular to BD. Similarly, OC is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, triangles OBD and OCD are right-angled at B and C respectively.\n\nNow, AD intersects the circle again at P. So, P is another point on the circle, distinct from A and D. We need to find the length of AP.\n\nLet me try to draw a diagram in my mind. Triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω. Tangent at B meets AD at D. Tangent at C meets AD at D. Then, AD intersects ω again at P. So, P is another intersection point of AD with ω. We need to find AP.\n\nSince AD is a chord of the circle, and P is another intersection point, maybe we can use power of a point or some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the point of tangency, maybe we can use the power of point D with respect to the circle. The power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB * DC, because D is the point of tangency. Wait, but D is the point of tangency, so DB and DC are the lengths from D to B and C respectively. But since D is on the tangent at B, DB is the length from D to B, which is equal to the length from D to B along the tangent. Wait, no. Wait, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so the length DB is the length from D to B along the tangent. But since D is on the tangent, DB is equal to the length from D to B along the tangent. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. So, if we consider the tangent at B, it's perpendicular to OB.

Aká je hodnota $m+n$?", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have an octahedron, which is a polyhedron with eight triangular faces. Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that after rotating the octahedron, all the blue vertices end up at the positions where the original red vertices were. The answer is given as m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize an octahedron. An octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 triangular faces. Each vertex is connected to four others. The problem is about the probability that after a rotation, the blue vertices end up at the positions of the red vertices. So, the key here is that the rotation must map the red vertices to the blue ones. Since the octahedron is symmetric, the rotation that maps the red vertices to the blue ones must be a rotation that swaps the red and blue vertices. But wait, the octahedron has 6 vertices, so a rotation can map 6 vertices to 6 vertices. So, the rotation must be a 6-cycle, right? Because a 6-cycle is a rotation that cycles all 6 vertices. So, the rotation must be a 6-cycle.\n\nBut how does this relate to the coloring? Each vertex is colored red or blue. The rotation must map the red vertices to the blue ones. So, the rotation must be a 6-cycle that swaps the red and blue vertices. But how many such rotations are there? Since the octahedron has 6 vertices, a rotation that is a 6-cycle must be a 6-cycle. The number of such rotations is equal to the number of 6-cycles in the octahedron's rotation group. But I need to figure out how many such rotations there are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a graph problem. Each vertex is a node, and the edges represent the adjacency. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of 6-cycles in the octahedron's graph, and then dividing by the total number of possible rotations (which is 6, since there are 6 vertices). But I need to confirm that the total number of rotations is 6, not 12. Wait, no. The octahedron has 6 vertices, so a rotation is a permutation of the vertices. The number of such permutations is 6! = 720. But wait, the problem states that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime. So, the total number of possible rotations is 720, but the number of favorable ones is 6 (since there are 6 6-cycles). So, the probability is 6/720 = 1/120. Then, m + n would be 1 + 120 = 121. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"rotated the octahedron\", so the rotation is a 6-cycle. But the octahedron has 6 vertices, so a rotation is a permutation of the vertices. The number of such permutations is 6! = 720. But the problem states that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime. So, the total number of favorable rotations is 6, and the total number of possible rotations is 720. So, the probability is 6/720 = 1/120. Then, m + n = 1 + 120 = 121. But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. It says: \"Pravdepodobnosť, že osemuholník môže byť potom otočený tak, že všetky modré vrcholy skončia na miestach, kde boli pôvodne červené vrcholy, je $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, kde $m$ a $n$ sú navzájom nesúdeliteľné kladné celé čísla.

So, we have two functions f(x) and g(x), and we need to find the number of intersection points between the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each function does. The function f(x) is the absolute value of the absolute value of x minus 1/2. So, f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. Similarly, g(x) is the absolute value of the absolute value of x minus 1/4. So, g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.\n\nNow, the first equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So, we need to compute f(sin(2πx)), then take the absolute value of that, multiply by 4, and set it equal to y. Similarly, the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, we need to compute f(cos(3πy)), take the absolute value of that, multiply by 4, and set it equal to x. So, we have two equations: one involving y and x, and the other involving x and y. The intersection points are the solutions to both equations simultaneously.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving the system of equations:\n\n1. y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))\n2. x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))\n\nOur goal is to find the number of real solutions (x, y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nLet me start by analyzing each function step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at f(x). Let's compute f(x) for different values of x. Since f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |, let's consider different cases based on the value of |x|.\n\nCase 1: |x| ≥ 1/2. Then, |x| - 1/2 ≥ 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n\nCase 2: |x| < 1/2. Then, |x| - 1/2 < 0, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = -|x| + 1/2.\n\nSo, f(x) can be written as:\n\nf(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2\n\nf(x) = -|x| + 1/2 if |x| < 1/2\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is | |x| - 1/4 |. Let's analyze g(x) for different values of |x|.\n\nCase 1: |x| ≥ 1/4. Then, |x| - 1/4 ≥ 0, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n\nCase 2: |x| < 1/4. Then, |x| - 1/4 < 0, so g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = -|x| + 1/4.\n\nSo, g(x) can be written as:\n\ng(x) = |x| - 1/4 if |x| ≥ 1/4\n\ng(x) = -|x| + 1/4 if |x| < 1/4\n\nNow, let's consider the composition of these functions. Let's first look at f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)).\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is a sine function with period π, it oscillates between -1 and 1. So, sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1]. Therefore, |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, f(cos(3πy)) = | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are expressions involving the absolute value of a sine or cosine function, which are bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are both in [0, 1]. Therefore, when we take 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we are scaling these values by 4, so the resulting y and x are in [0, 4]. But wait, the original functions f and g are defined for |x| ≥ 1/2 and |x| ≥ 1/4, respectively. So, the arguments of f and g are in [0, 1] and [0, 1/4], respectively. Therefore, the composition f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are in [0, 1], so 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are in [0, 4]. Therefore, the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are both in [0, 4], so we can consider them as real numbers.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the number of real solutions (x, y) to the system:\n\ny = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))\n\nx = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))\n\nSo, we need to find the number of real solutions to this system.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Since both equations are in terms of y and x, and both are bounded between 0 and 4, maybe we can use substitution or some algebraic manipulation to simplify the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the functions f and g, and their compositions, and analyze their behavior.\n\nFirst, let's note that f(x) and g(x) are both piecewise linear functions. Let's see:\n\nFor f(x):\n\n- If |x| ≥ 1/2, then f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So, for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) is a straight line from (1/2, 0) to (1, -1/2). For |x| < 1/2, f(x) is a straight line from (0, 1/2) to (-1/2, 0).\n\nSimilarly, for g(x):\n\n- If |x| ≥ 1/4, then g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So, for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) is a straight line from (1/4, 0) to (1, 1/4). For |x| < 1/4, g(x) is a straight line from (0, 1/4) to (-1/4, 0).\n\nSo, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, respectively. Therefore, their compositions will also be piecewise linear functions.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(sin(2πx)). Let's analyze this function. Since sin(2πx) is a sine function with period π, it oscillates between -1 and 1. So, sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1]. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Let's see the behavior of f(sin(2πx)).\n\nFor |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2, which is when |x| ≥ 1/2, so f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. For |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, which is when |x| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = -|sin(2πx)| + 1/2.\n\nTherefore, f(sin(2πx)) is a piecewise linear function with slopes of 1 and -1, respectively, and it is symmetric around the y-axis. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor |x| ≥ 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. So, when |x| ≥ 1/2, sin(2πx) is between 1/2 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| is between 1/2 and 1. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and -1/2. Similarly, when |x| < 1/2, sin(2πx) is between -1/2 and 0, so |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) is between -1/2 and 0.\n\nTherefore, f(sin(2πx)) is a piecewise linear function with slopes of 1 and -1, and it is symmetric around the y-axis. Wait, let's check the slope:\n\nFor |x| ≥ 1/2, the slope is 1. For |x| < 1/2, the slope is -1. So, the function is increasing for |x| ≥ 1/2 and decreasing for |x| < 1/2. Therefore, it is symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |, which is a piecewise linear function with slopes of 1 and -1, and it is symmetric around the y-axis. Let's see:\n\nFor |x| ≥ 1/4, the slope is 1. For |x| < 1/4, the slope is -1. So, it is symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, both f(sin(2πx)) and g(x) are piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, and they are symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the composition f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)). Let's analyze these compositions.\n\nFirst, let's consider f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)). Since both f and g are piecewise linear functions, their compositions will also be piecewise linear functions. However, the composition f(sin(2πx)) is a function of x, and f(cos(3πy)) is a function of y. So, we need to consider how these functions interact.\n\nLet me think about possible transformations. Since both f and g are piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, their compositions will also be piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, but with different slopes. However, the key point is that both f and g are symmetric around the y-axis, so their compositions will also be symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the function f(sin(2πx)) is symmetric around the y-axis, and f(cos(3πy)) is symmetric around the y-axis. Therefore, the composition f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are both symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both equations are in terms of y and x, and both are bounded between 0 and 4, we can consider them as real numbers. However, the problem is to find the number of real solutions (x, y) to these equations.\n\nGiven that both functions f and g are piecewise linear with slopes of 1 and -1, and they are symmetric around the y-axis, maybe we can use substitution to simplify the equations.\n\nLet me try to substitute variables. Let me set u = sin(2πx) and v = cos(3πy). Then, the equations become:\n\ny = 4g(f(u))\n\nx = 4g(f(v))\n\nSo, we need to find the number of real solutions (u, v) to the system:\n\ny = 4g(f(u))\n\nx = 4g(f(v))\n\nSince both u and v are in [-1, 1], and f(u) and f(v) are in [0, 1], and g(f(u)) and g(f(v)) are in [0, 4], so x and y are in [0, 4].\n\nBut how do we relate u and v? Since u = sin(2πx) and v = cos(3πy), we can express x and y in terms of u and v. However, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that both u and v are in [-1, 1], and f(u) and f(v) are in [0, 1], so 4g(f(u)) and 4g(f(v)) are in [0, 4], so x and y are in [0, 4].\n\nBut how do we find the number of solutions to this system?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Since both equations are in terms of y and x, and both are bounded between 0 and 4, maybe we can use substitution to express one variable in terms of the other. For example, let's solve for x in terms of y from the first equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom the first equation: y = 4g(f(u)) => g(f(u)) = y/4\n\nFrom the second equation: x = 4g(f(v)) => g(f(v)) = x/4\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. g(f(u)) = y/4\n\n2. g(f(v)) = x/4\n\nBut since both g(f(u)) and g(f(v)) are in [0, 4], and x and y are in [0, 4], then x/4 and y/4 are in [0, 1]. Therefore, g(f(u)) and g(f(v)) are in [0, 1], so x and y are in [0, 4].\n\nBut how do we relate u and v? Since u = sin(2πx) and v = cos(3πy), we can express x and y in terms of u and v. However, this might not be straightforward.

Both f and g are piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, and they are symmetric around the y-axis. Therefore, their compositions will also be piecewise linear functions with slopes of 1 and -1, but with different slopes. However, the key point is that both f and g are symmetric around the y-axis, so their compositions will also be symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the function f(sin(2πx)) is symmetric around the y-axis, and f(cos(3πy)) is symmetric around the y-axis. Therefore, the composition f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are both symmetric around the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the equations y = 4g(f(u)) and x = 4g(f(v)).

So, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the smallest prime number. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, p is the smallest prime number, which is 2. So, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 2^2 = 4. That means m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 4. So, m^4 ≡ -1 mod 4. Let's see what m^4 can be modulo 4. Let's compute m^4 for m from 0 to 3 modulo 4.\n\nm | m^4 mod 4\n0 | 0^4 = 0 mod 4\n1 | 1^4 = 1 mod 4\n2 | 2^4 = 16 ≡ 0 mod 4\n3 | 3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 4\n\nSo, m^4 mod 4 cycles through 0, 1, 0, 1. So, m^4 ≡ 0 or 1 mod 4. Therefore, m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 or 2 mod 4. So, m^4 + 1 is divisible by 4 if and only if m^4 ≡ 3 mod 4. But from the above, m^4 mod 4 is either 0 or 1. So, m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 or 2 mod 4. Therefore, m^4 + 1 is divisible by 4 if and only if m^4 ≡ 3 mod 4. But since m^4 mod 4 is either 0 or 1, m^4 + 1 can only be 0 or 2 mod 4. Therefore, m^4 + 1 is divisible by 4 if and only if m^4 ≡ 3 mod 4. But since m^4 mod 4 is either 0 or 1, m^4 + 1 can only be 0 or 2 mod 4.

The goal is to find a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distance from I to each face is equal. The answer should be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is not divisible by any perfect square. Then, we need to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all faces is called the centroid of the faces. Wait, no.

So, we have a set of rectangular boxes with a total surface area of 54 and a total volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain all these boxes, then square that radius, and express that as a fraction in simplest terms. The answer should be the sum of the numerator and denominator of that fraction.\n\nFirst, let me recall some formulas. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2*(length + width + height)^2. The volume is length * width * height. So, we have two equations here: 2*(l + w + h)^2 = 54 and l * w * h = 23. We need to find the minimum possible value of r, where r is the radius of the sphere that can contain all these boxes. Then, we need to compute r squared and express it as a fraction in simplest terms, and find p + q where p and q are coprime.\n\nHmm. Let me start by understanding the problem. The sphere must contain all the boxes, so the sphere's diameter must be at least as large as the maximum of the three dimensions. So, the radius r is the minimum of the three dimensions, right? Because if the sphere is to contain all the boxes, the sphere's diameter must be at least as large as the largest dimension. So, r is the minimum of l, w, h. Then, r squared is the square of that minimum. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of l, w, h, and then squaring that minimum.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the possible dimensions l, w, h such that l * w * h = 23 and 2*(l + w + h)^2 = 54. Then, among all possible combinations of l, w, h, we need to find the one that gives the minimum l, w, h, and then compute r squared.\n\nLet me start by considering possible integer values for l, w, h. Since 23 is a prime number, the only possible integer dimensions are 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23, 1, 1, 23,

Nájdite $xy$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log_x(y^x) equals 10 and log_y(x^4y) also equals 10. Hmm, let's start by understanding what these logarithmic equations mean.\n\nFirst, let's recall that log_b(a) = c implies that b^c = a. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the logarithm rule, this can be rewritten as x^10 = y^x. Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^4y) = 10, which becomes y^10 = x^4y. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. x^10 = y^x\n2. y^10 = x^4y\n\nLet me try to manipulate these equations to find a relationship between x and y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation.\n\nStarting with the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify:\n\nln(x^10) = ln(y^x)\n10 ln x = x ln y\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^4y. Again, take the natural logarithm:\n\nln(y^10) = ln(x^4y)\n10 ln y = 4 ln x + ln y\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. 10 ln x = x ln y\n2. 10 ln y = 4 ln x + ln y\n\nLet me denote ln x as a and ln y as b. Then the equations become:\n\n1. 10a = x b\n2. 10b = 4a + b\n\nNow, let's solve these two equations for a and b. Let's try to express x and y in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 10a / b\n\nFrom equation 2: 10b = 4a + b => 10b - b = 4a => 9b = 4a => a = (9/4)b\n\nSo, substituting a = (9/4)b into equation 1:\n\nx = 10*(9/4)b / b = 10*(9/4) = 90/4 = 45/2\n\nTherefore, x = 45/2\n\nNow, let's find y. Since a = ln x = ln(45/2), so y = e^a = e^(ln(45/2)) = 45/2\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. Let's verify the original equations with x = 45/2 and y = 45/2.\n\nFirst equation: x^10 = (45/2)^10. Let's compute that. Since 45/2 is 22.5, which is 22.5^10. Let's compute 22.5^10. Maybe that's manageable. Alternatively, maybe we can compute 45/2^10. Let's see:\n\n45/2^10 = 45/(1024) ≈ 0.0439453125\n\nBut 45/2^10 is approximately 0.0439453125, which is less than 1. But the first equation is x^10 = y^x. So, if x = 45/2, then y^x = (45/2)^x. Let's compute (45/2)^x. Since x is 10, (45/2)^10 is approximately 0.0439453125, which is less than 1. But the first equation says that x^10 = y^x. So, if x = 45/2, then y^x = (45/2)^x, which is less than 1. But the second equation is y^10 = x^4y.

So, Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 coins from a pile of n coins. The player who takes the last coin wins. We need to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the game dynamics. Since Alice starts, and they take turns, the game is a turn-based game. The key here is to determine when Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves. \n\nLet me think about the possible winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can force a win. \n\nI recall that in such games, the concept of Grundy numbers or Nimbers can be used. The Grundy number for a position is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of all positions that can be reached in one move. The game is determined by the Grundy numbers of the positions. \n\nSo, the Grundy number for a position with k coins is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions with k-1 and k-4 coins. Because each player can take either 1 or 4 coins, so the next position is either k-1 or k-4. \n\nTherefore, the Grundy number for n coins is the mex of the Grundy numbers of (n-1) and (n-4). \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n ≤ 2024 where the Grundy number of n is 0. Because if the Grundy number of n is 0, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, leading to a win. \n\nTherefore, the question is: For which n is the Grundy number of n equal to 0? \n\nLet me recall that the Grundy number for a position with k coins is the mex of the Grundy numbers of (k-1) and (k-4). \n\nSo, the Grundy number for n is the mex of G(n-1) and G(n-4). \n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding all n ≤ 2024 such that mex(G(n-1), G(n-4)) = 0. \n\nBut how do I compute G(n) for each n? Let's see. \n\nLet's start with small n and compute G(n). \n\nFor n=1: The Grundy number is mex(G(0), G(-3)). But G(0) is undefined, so mex(0, G(-3)) = mex(0, mex(0, G(-7))) = mex(0, mex(0, mex(0, G(-11)))) = ... So, G(1) is the mex of G(0) and G(-3). But G(0) is undefined, so G(1) is undefined. \n\nWait, but the Grundy number for n=1 is undefined because there's no position with 0 coins. So, the Grundy number for n=1 is undefined. \n\nSimilarly, for n=2: G(2) is mex(G(1), G(-2)). But G(1) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(-2)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-6))) = ... So, G(2) is undefined. \n\nSimilarly, for n=3: G(3) is mex(G(2), G(-3)). But G(2) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(-3)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-7))) = ... So, G(3) is undefined. \n\nWait, but the Grundy number for n=3 is the mex of G(2) and G(-3). But G(2) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(-3)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-7))) = ... So, G(3) is undefined. \n\nSimilarly, for n=4: G(4) is mex(G(3), G(-4)). But G(3) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(-4)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-8))) = ... So, G(4) is undefined. \n\nHmm, this seems like a problem. Because for n=1, 2, 3, 4, the Grundy numbers are undefined. So, the problem reduces to finding n where G(n) is defined and equals 0. \n\nBut how do I compute G(n) for n ≥ 5? Let's try to compute G(n) for n=5, 6, 7, etc. \n\nLet's start with n=5. G(5) is mex(G(4), G(1)). But G(4) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(1)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-3))) = ... So, G(5) is undefined. \n\nSimilarly, for n=6: G(6) is mex(G(5), G(2)). But G(5) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(2)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-3))) = ... So, G(6) is undefined. \n\nFor n=7: G(7) is mex(G(6), G(3)). But G(6) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(3)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-4))) = ... So, G(7) is undefined. \n\nFor n=8: G(8) is mex(G(7), G(4)). But G(7) is undefined, so mex(undef, G(4)) = mex(undef, mex(undef, G(-1))) = ... So, G(8) is undefined. \n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. For n ≥ 5, the Grundy number is undefined because there's a position with 0 coins (n-1) or -3 coins (n-4). So, the Grundy number for n is undefined. \n\nTherefore, the only possible n where the Grundy number is defined and equals 0 are n=1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that n ≤ 2024. So, n=1, 2, 3, 4 are the only possible n. \n\nBut let me check n=1 again. The Grundy number for n=1 is undefined. So, n=1 is not a winning position for Bob. \n\nSimilarly, n=2: undefined. \n\nn=3: undefined. \n\nn=4: undefined. \n\nSo, the only possible n where the Grundy number is defined and equals 0 are n=1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"positive integers n ≤ 2024\". So, n=1, 2, 3, 4 are the only possible n. \n\nBut let me verify this with some small examples. \n\nSuppose n=1: Alice takes 1 coin. Bob can't take any coins. So, Bob loses. \n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1. Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1. Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1. Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1. Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1. Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1.

Nájdite $m+n$.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jen is playing a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. The prize is awarded if at least two of the four numbers are 2. The grand prize is awarded if all four numbers are 2. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she already won the small prize. Then, express this probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem into manageable parts. The key here is to calculate the probability that all four numbers are 2 given that at least two are 2. Then, since the grand prize is the same as the probability that all four numbers are 2, we can compute that probability and then find the required fraction.\n\nLet me start by understanding the sample space. The total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from 10 is C(10,4). That's 210. Now, the sample space for the small prize (at least two 2s) is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s. The grand prize (all four 2s) is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s. So, the probability we need is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (all four 2s) to the number of outcomes with at least two 2s.\n\nSo, the probability P(grand prize | small prize) = (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s) / (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s).\n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator: Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s. This is the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers minus the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero 2s. So, the number of ways with at least two 2s is C(10,4) - C(8,4). Because if you have zero 2s, you have to choose all four numbers from the remaining 8 numbers (since there are 8 numbers not including 2). So, C(10,4) - C(8,4) = 210 - 70 = 140.\n\nNow, the numerator: Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s. Since all four numbers must be 2, there's only one way to do that. So, the numerator is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/140. But wait, the problem states that the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime. So, 1/140 is already in simplest terms, so m = 1, n = 140. Therefore, m + n = 141. But let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s is 210 - 70 = 140. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s is 1. So, 1/140. Yes, that seems correct. So, m = 1, n = 140, so m + n = 141. That seems right.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. Let's consider the sample space again. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s is 210 - 70 = 140. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s is 1. So, the probability is 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way this probability could be expressed. For example, maybe the probability of winning the grand prize given that she already won the small prize is the same as the probability of winning the grand prize. Wait, no. Because the grand prize is the same as the probability of all four numbers being 2. So, the probability we need is the probability that all four numbers are 2 given that at least two are 2. So, it's the conditional probability. So, the formula is P(grand prize | small prize) = (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s) / (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s). Which we already calculated as 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that all four numbers are 2 given that at least two are 2. But the grand prize is the same as the probability of all four numbers being 2. So, the probability we need is the probability of all four numbers being 2 given that at least two are 2. So, it's the conditional probability. So, the formula is P(grand prize | small prize) = (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s) / (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s). Which we calculated as 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation. For example, when calculating the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s, we subtracted the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero 2s. But if we choose all four numbers from the remaining 8 numbers (since there are 8 numbers not including 2), then the number of ways is C(8,4) = 70. So, 210 - 70 = 140. That's correct. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s is 140. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s is 1. So, the probability is 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems solid.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, maybe the probability of winning the grand prize given that she already won the small prize is the same as the probability of winning the grand prize. Wait, no. Because the grand prize is the same as the probability of all four numbers being 2. So, the probability we need is the probability that all four numbers are 2 given that at least two are 2. So, it's the conditional probability. So, the formula is P(grand prize | small prize) = (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s) / (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s). Which we calculated as 1/140.

But if we choose all four numbers from the remaining 8 numbers (since there are 8 numbers not including 2), then the number of ways is C(8,4) = 70. So, 210 - 70 = 140. That's correct. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s is 140. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s is 1. So, the probability is 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141.

So, the formula is P(grand prize | small prize) = (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s) / (Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s). Which we calculated as 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation. For example, when calculating the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s, we subtracted the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero 2s. But if we choose all four numbers from the remaining 8 numbers (since there are 8 numbers not including 2), then the number of ways is C(8,4) = 70. So, 210 - 70 = 140. That's correct. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two 2s is 140. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with all four 2s is 1. So, the probability is 1/140. So, m = 1, n = 140, m + n = 141. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, maybe the probability of winning the grand prize given that she already won the small prize is the same as the probability of winning the grand prize. Wait, no.

So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with some interesting properties. The first property is that points D, E, C, F are colinear. That means they lie on the same straight line. The second property is that points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE, given that BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. The problem states that points D, E, C, F are colinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Similarly, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the circle passes through points A, D, H, G. We need to find CE, which is the distance between points C and E.\n\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, AB is one side, and BC is the other. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is one side, and FG is the other. The problem gives us the lengths of BC, AB, FG, and EF. We need to find CE. Let me note down the given values:\n\n- BC = 16\n- AB = 107\n- FG = 17\n- EF = 184\n\nSo, the sides of the rectangles are AB = 107, BC = 16, EF = 184, FG = 17. The problem mentions that points D, E, C, F are colinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Similarly, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the circle passes through A, D, H, G. We need to find CE, which is the distance between C and E.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17. The problem mentions that points D, E, C, F are colinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me try to visualize this. If D, E, C, F are colinear, then the line connecting D to F passes through E and C. So, EF is a segment that connects E and F, and D is somewhere on this line. Similarly, A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the circle passes through A, D, H, G. We need to find CE.\n\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, point C is at the opposite corner from A. Similarly, point E is at the opposite corner from D. So, if D, E, C, F are colinear, then the line EF passes through C and E. So, EF is a segment that connects E and F, and C is somewhere on this line. Similarly, A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the circle passes through A, D, H, G. We need to find CE.\n\nLet me try to draw a diagram in my mind. Let me label the points:\n\n- Let me place rectangle ABCD with AB along the x-axis and BC along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, 0), B is at (107, 0), C is at (107, 16), and D is at (0, 16). Similarly, rectangle EFGH with EF along the x-axis and FG along the y-axis. So, point E is at (184, 0), F is at (184, 17), G is at (0, 17), and H is at (0, 0). But wait, the problem states that points A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the circle passes through A (0,0), D (0,16), H (0,0), and G (0,17). But that's impossible because a circle passing through three points on a straight line (like A, D, H, G) would have to be a degenerate circle, which is a single point. But the problem states that A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.\" So, the circle passes through A, D, H, G. So, the circle is defined by these four points. So, the circle is the set of all points equidistant from A, D, H, G. So, the circle is the intersection of the three circles centered at A, D, H with radius equal to the distance from A to D, D to H, H to G. Wait, but A, D, H, G are colinear. So, the circle passing through A, D, H, G would have to be a circle passing through four colinear points.

Nájdite počet takýchto ciest, ktoré zmenia smer presne štyrikrát, ako v príkladoch uvedených nižšie.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have an 8x8 grid, and we need to find the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. Each step can be either right or up, and we need to count the paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the total number of paths from the bottom-left to the top-right in an 8x8 grid is 7! because each path consists of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, so total steps are 16. The total number of paths is 16 choose 8, which is 12870. But wait, maybe I need to adjust that because the problem says \"exactly four times\". So, the number of times the path changes direction is four. So, the path must have exactly four right-up or up-right transitions. \n\nWait, right, right-up and up-right are the same direction, so the path changes direction when it goes from right to up or up to right. So, the number of times the path changes direction is equal to the number of times the path goes from right to up or up to right. So, if the path changes direction four times, then the number of right-up or up-right transitions is four. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) that have exactly four right-up or up-right transitions. Then, we need to subtract the number of paths that have more than four changes or fewer than four changes. But since the total number of paths is 12870, and the number of paths with exactly four changes is the same as the number of paths with exactly four right-up or up-right transitions, then the answer would be 12870 minus the number of paths with more than four changes. But wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of paths with exactly four changes is equal to the number of paths with exactly four right-up or up-right transitions. So, the answer is 12870 minus the number of paths with more than four changes. But how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of paths with exactly four changes is equal to the number of paths with exactly four right-up or up-right transitions. So, the answer is 12870 minus the number of paths with more than four changes.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression is [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z]. Since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, we can write z as 4e^(iθ), where θ is the argument of z. That might be useful because then we can express z and 1/z in terms of their magnitudes and arguments. Let me recall that for a complex number z = re^(iθ), the reciprocal is 1/z = r^{-1}e^{-iθ}. So, if |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4. Therefore, the real part of 1/z is 1/4 cos θ, and the imaginary part is -1/4 sin θ. That might help in simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me denote z = 4e^(iθ). Then, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, the expression becomes [(75 + 117i)(4e^(iθ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}]. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)(4e^(iθ)) = 75*4*e^(iθ) + 117i*4*e^(iθ) = 300e^(iθ) + 468i*e^(iθ).\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (96/4)e^{-iθ} + (144i/4)e^{-iθ} = 24e^{-iθ} + 36i*e^{-iθ}.\n\nSo, combining both terms, the expression is [300e^(iθ) + 468i*e^(iθ) + 24e^{-iθ} + 36i*e^{-iθ}]. Let me group the real and imaginary parts.\n\nReal part: 300e^(iθ) + 24e^{-iθ}.\n\nImaginary part: 468i*e^(iθ) + 36i*e^{-iθ}.\n\nNow, let's compute the real part. Let's write e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ and e^{-iθ} = cos θ - i sin θ. So, 300e^(iθ) = 300(cos θ + i sin θ) = 300 cos θ + 300i sin θ.\n\nSimilarly, 24e^{-iθ} = 24(cos θ - i sin θ) = 24 cos θ - 24i sin θ.\n\nAdding these together: (300 cos θ + 24 cos θ) + (300i sin θ - 24i sin θ) = 324 cos θ + 276i sin θ.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos θ + 276i sin θ.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 468i cos θ + 36i sin θ = 36i (12 cos θ + 1) + 468i sin θ.\n\nSo, the imaginary part is 36i (12 cos θ + 1) + 468i sin θ.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is [324 cos θ + 276i sin θ] + [36i (12 cos θ + 1) + 468i sin θ] = [324 cos θ + 36i (12 cos θ + 1)] + [276i sin θ + 468i sin θ] = [324 cos θ + 36i (12 cos θ + 1)] + [276i sin θ + 468i sin θ].\n\nLet me combine the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 324 cos θ + 36i (12 cos θ + 1)\n\nImaginary part: 276i sin θ + 468i sin θ = 744i sin θ.\n\nSo, the expression is 324 cos θ + 36i (12 cos θ + 1) + 744i sin θ.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum real part of this expression. The real part is 324 cos θ + 36i (12 cos θ + 1) + 744i sin θ. The real part is 324 cos θ + 744 sin θ. So, we need to maximize 324 cos θ + 744 sin θ.\n\nThis is a standard optimization problem. The maximum value of a function of the form a cos θ + b sin θ is sqrt(a² + b²). So, the maximum real part is sqrt(324² + 744²). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 324² = (300 + 24)² = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105976.\n\n744² = (700 + 44)² = 700² + 2*700*44 + 44² = 490000 + 61600 + 1936 = 552536.\n\nAdding them together: 105976 + 552536 = 658512.\n\nSo, sqrt(658512). Let me compute that. 658512 divided by 100 is 6585.12, so sqrt(6585.12) is approximately 81.05. Let me check with exact values.\n\nsqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) = sqrt(658512) =

The problem says that 2024 circles with radius 1 can be arranged in a certain way. Then, we need to find the inradius of triangle ABC, which is expressed as m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. There's a big circle with radius 34, and two smaller circles that touch it. Then, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in a certain way. The inradius of triangle ABC is given as m/n, and we need to find m + n. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out the configuration of the two smaller circles and how they relate to the triangle. Then, the inradius of the triangle can be calculated based on that configuration. Let me start by visualizing the setup.\n\nThe big circle has radius 34. The two smaller circles touch it. Let's denote the radius of the two smaller circles as r. Since they touch the big circle, the distance between the centers of the big circle and each smaller circle is 34 - r. Because the radius of the big circle is 34, and the radius of each smaller circle is r, so the distance between their centers is 34 - r.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in a certain way. Maybe this is related to the arrangement of the two smaller circles. Let me think. If we have two smaller circles touching the big circle, and 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged around them, maybe the arrangement is such that the two smaller circles are arranged in a way that allows 2024 circles of radius 1 to be placed around them.

Nájdite najväčšie reálne číslo, ktoré je menšie ako $BD^2$ pre všetky takéto kosoštvorce.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The problem states that points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a quadrilateral ABCD, and that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. We need to find the maximum real number less than BD² for all such quadrilaterals. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by recalling some properties of hyperbolas and quadrilaterals.\n\nFirst, the standard form of a hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, where a² and b² are the denominators. In this case, a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, the hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening left and right. The asymptotes are given by y = ±(b/a)x. Let me compute the asymptotes. Since a = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.472 and b = sqrt(24) ≈ 4.899, the asymptotes are y = ±(4.899/4.472)x ≈ ±1.095x. So, the asymptotes are y = ±1.095x.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the point where the diagonals meet. In a quadrilateral, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is a special property. For a quadrilateral to have its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the quadrilateral must be a parallelogram. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. In a quadrilateral, the diagonals intersect at the origin if and only if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. That's a known property. So, quadrilateral ABCD must be a parallelogram. That simplifies things a lot.\n\nSo, ABCD is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Also, the diagonals AC and BD bisect each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That's a key point.\n\nNow, the problem states that the quadrilateral is a kite. Wait, but the problem says \"kosoštvorec\", which is a Croatian word. I think it might be a typo. Maybe it's a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal. Wait, in a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular. But in a parallelogram, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then it's a kite. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if it's a kite, then it must be a rhombus. Wait, no. A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if ABCD is a kite, then it must be a rhombus. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. So, if ABCD is a rhombus, then it's a kite. So, in this case, since it's a parallelogram, it's a kite, which is a rhombus. So, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, which is consistent.\n\nSo, the quadrilateral is a rhombus (kite) with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let me denote the length of diagonal AC as d1 and diagonal BD as d2. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the coordinates of the origin are (d1/2, 0) and (0, d2/2). So, the coordinates of the origin are (x0, y0) = (d1/2, 0) and (0, d2/2). So, the origin is at (d1/2, 0) and (0, d2/2). So, the coordinates of the origin are (d1/2, 0) and (0, d2/2).

So, we have a town called Aimeville with 900 residents. The problem gives us three different items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and a garden hoe. Each resident has at least one of these items. The counts are as follows:\n\n- Diamond rings: 195\n- Golf clubs: 367\n- Garden hoe: 562\n\nAdditionally, there are 437 residents who have exactly two of these items, and 234 residents who have exactly three of them. We need to find the number of residents who have all four items.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each resident has at least one item, so the total number of items is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. But since each resident has at least one item, the total number of items is 1124, but the actual number of items each resident has is between 1 and 3. Wait, but the problem says \"each resident has at least one of these items,\" so the total number of items is 1124, but each resident has at least one, so the actual number of items each resident has is between 1 and 3. So, the total number of items is 1124, but each resident has at least one, so the actual number of items is 1124. But the problem says \"each resident has at least one of these items,\" so the total number of items is 1124, but each resident has at least one, so the actual number of items is 1124. But the problem also mentions that there are 437 residents who have exactly two items and 234 who have exactly three items. So, the total number of residents is 900, which is the sum of those with exactly two, exactly three, and all four items. So, 437 + 234 + x = 900, where x is the number of residents with all four items. So, x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 231. So, 231 residents have all four items. But wait, the problem says \"each resident has at least one of these items,\" so the total number of items is 1124, but each resident has at least one, so the actual number of items is 1124. But the problem also mentions that there are 437 residents who have exactly two items and 234 who have exactly three items. So, the total number of residents is 900, which is the sum of those with exactly two, exactly three, and all four items. So, 437 + 234 + x = 900, so x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 231.

The line IA is perpendicular to the line IO. The circumradius of the incircle is 13, and the exradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of incenters and excenters, and how they relate to the triangle's sides and angles.\n\nFirst, the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The excenter O is the intersection of the external angle bisectors. The circumradius of the incircle (which is the inradius, r) is given as 13. The exradius opposite to angle A is given as 6. The exradius is related to the inradius by the formula r_a = r + 2R, where R is the circumradius. Wait, that's a key formula. Let me verify that. The exradius opposite to angle A is r_a = r + 2R. Similarly, r_b = r + 2R' and r_c = r + 2R''. So, if we know r and R, we can find r_a. Let's check that. If r = 13 and R = 13, then r_a = 13 + 2*13 = 13 + 26 = 39. But the problem states that the exradius opposite to angle A is 6. So, according to this formula, if the inradius is 13, then the exradius opposite to angle A should be 39. But the problem says it's 6. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the formula again.\n\nWait, the exradius opposite to angle A is given by r_a = r + 2R. So, if r = 13 and R = 13, then r_a = 13 + 2*13 = 13 + 26 = 39. But the problem states that the exradius opposite to angle A is 6. So, this suggests that either the formula is different, or there's a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, but the problem says \"the exradius opposite to angle A is 6\". So, if the exradius opposite to angle A is 6, then according to the formula, the inradius should be 13. But the problem states that the inradius is 13. So, there's a contradiction here. That's a problem. Maybe the problem is misstated, or there's a different formula. Let me check the standard formula again.\n\nWait, the exradius opposite to angle A is given by r_a = r + 2R.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the sum of the numbers is 300. So, a + b + c = 300. The second condition is a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Let me write that down again to make sure I have it right.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Since a, b, c are non-negative integers, maybe I can factor this expression. Let's see. The left-hand side has terms like a²b, a²c, b²a, etc. Maybe I can group terms to see if there's a common factor or a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution variables. Let me set x = a + b + c. So, x = 300. Then, the second condition becomes a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me denote S = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. So, S = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, maybe I can express S in terms of x. Let's see. If I consider the expression S, it's a sum of products of squares. Let me try to factor this expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity for the sum of products of squares. Let me recall that for three variables, there's a formula for the sum of products of squares. Let me check.\n\nThe formula for the sum of products of squares is:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c²) - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca)^2.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's expand the right-hand side:\n\nFirst term: (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c²) = a³ + a²b + a²c + ab² + b³ + b²c + ac² + bc² + c³.\n\nSecond term: - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) = - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) = -a²b - a²c - ab² - b³ - b²c - bc² - ac² - ca² - c³.\n\nThird term: (ab + bc + ca)^2 = (ab + bc + ca)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nNow, adding all three terms together:\n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term:\n\n= (a³ + a²b + a²c + ab² + b³ + b²c + ac² + bc² + c³) + (-a²b - a²c - ab² - b³ - b²c - bc² - ac² - ca² - c³) + (a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca²)\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\nFor a³: a³\n\nFor a²b: a²b + (-a²b) = 0\n\nFor a²c: a²c + (-a²c) = 0\n\nFor ab²: ab² + (-ab²) = 0\n\nFor b³: b³ + (-b³) = 0\n\nFor b²c: b²c + (-b²c) = 0\n\nFor ac²: ac² + (-ac²) = 0\n\nFor bc²: bc² + (-bc²) = 0\n\nFor c³: c³ + (-c³) = 0\n\nFor a²b²: a²b²\n\nFor a²c²: a²c²\n\nFor b²c²: b²c²\n\nFor 2a²b: 2a²b\n\nFor 2a²c: 2a²c\n\nFor 2b²c: 2b²c\n\nFor 2ab²: 2ab²\n\nFor 2bc²: 2bc²\n\nFor 2ca²: 2ca²\n\nNow, adding all these terms:\n\na³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca²\n\nSo, the total sum S = a³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nBut wait, the original expression S = 6,000,000. So, we have:\n\na³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca² = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to factor this expression. Let's see. Let me rearrange the terms:\n\na³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca².\n\nAlternatively, group terms:\n\na³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca².\n\nLet me see if I can factor this. Let's look for a pattern. Maybe it's a sum of cubes or something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the expression resembles the expansion of (a + b + c)^3. Let's check:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nBut our expression is a³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca². Let's see if this is equal to (a + b + c)^3.\n\nWait, let's compute (a + b + c)^3:\n\n= a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nBut our expression is a³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca².\n\nComparing the two, we see that the first term is a³, the second term is 2a²b, the third term is 2a²c, the fourth term is 2ab², the fifth term is 2b²c, the sixth term is 2bc², the seventh term is a²b², the eighth term is a²c², the ninth term is b²c², the tenth term is 2ca². So, the difference is 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca² + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nSo, the original expression S = a³ + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2ab² + 2b²c + 2bc² + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2ca² = (a + b + c)^3 - 3a²b - 3a²c - 3b²a - 3b²c - 3c²a - 3c²b - 6abc.\n\nBut our original equation is S = 6,000,000. So, substituting S = (a + b + c)^3 - 3a²b - 3a²c - 3b²a - 3b²c - 3c²a - 3c²b - 6abc, we get:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 - 3a²b - 3a²c - 3b²a - 3b²c - 3c²a - 3c²b - 6abc = 6,000,000.\n\nBut we know that a + b + c = 300. Let me substitute that into the equation.\n\nSo, (300)^3 - 3a²b - 3a²c - 3b²a - 3b²c - 3c²a - 3c²b - 6abc = 6,000,000.\n\nCalculating (300)^3: 300 * 300 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, 27,000,000 - 3a²b - 3a²c - 3b²a - 3b²c - 3c²a - 3c²b - 6abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSubtracting 6,000,000 from both sides:\n\n27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nSo, 21,000,000 = 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n7,000,000 = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 2abc.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 2abc = 7,000,000.\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. Let me denote S' = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 2abc. Then, S' = 7,000,000.\n\nNow, the original problem is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and S' = 7,000,000.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions (a, b, c) to the system:\n\na + b + c = 300,\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 7,000,000.\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation, but with three variables. Diophantine equations with three variables are generally difficult to solve, but maybe we can find a pattern or use some combinatorial methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use generating functions or some substitution to simplify the problem. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider the generating function approach. The generating function for the sum a + b + c = 300 is (1 + x + x² + ... + x^300)^3. The generating function for the sum a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b is more complicated, but maybe we can use the identity I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the sum S' = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 2abc = 7,000,000. Let me denote S'' = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Then, S'' + 2abc = 7,000,000. So, S'' = 7,000,000 - 2abc.\n\nBut S'' is the sum of products of squares. Let me recall that S'' = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c²) - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca)^2.\n\nWait, let's check that again. Let's expand S'':\n\nFirst term: (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c²) = a³ + a²b + a²c + ab² + b³ + b²c + ac² + bc² + c³.\n\nSecond term: - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) = - (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) = -a²b - a²c - ab² - b³ - b²c - bc² - ac² - ca² - c³.\n\nThird term: (ab + bc + ca)^2 = (ab + bc + ca)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\na³ + a²b + a²c + ab² + b³ + b²c + ac² + bc² + c³ - a²b - a²c - ab² - b³ - b²c - bc² - ac² - ca² - c³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nSimplifying term by term:\n\na³ + a²b + a²c + ab² + b³ + b²c + ac² + bc² + c³ - a²b - a²c - ab² - b³ - b²c - bc² - ac² - ca² - c³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nFor a³: a³\n\nFor a²b: a²b + (-a²b) = 0\n\nFor a²c: a²c + (-a²c) = 0\n\nFor ab²: ab² + (-ab²) = 0\n\nFor b³: b³ + (-b³) = 0\n\nFor b²c: b²c + (-b²c) = 0\n\nFor ac²: ac² + (-ac²) = 0\n\nFor bc²: bc² + (-bc²) = 0\n\nFor c³: c³ + (-c³) = 0\n\nFor a²b²: a²b²\n\nFor a²c²: a²c²\n\nFor b²c²: b²c²\n\nFor 2a²b: 2a²b\n\nFor 2a²c: 2a²c\n\nFor 2b²c: 2b²c\n\nFor 2ab²: 2ab²\n\nFor 2bc²: 2bc²\n\nFor 2ca²: 2ca²\n\nSo, the total sum S'' = a³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca².\n\nBut we know that S'' = 7,000,000 - 2abc. So, substituting S'' into the equation:\n\na³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca² = 7,000,000 - 2abc.\n\nBut we also have a + b + c = 300. Let me denote x = a + b + c = 300. Then, the equation becomes:\n\na³ + a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2a²b + 2a²c + 2b²c + 2ab² + 2bc² + 2ca² = 7,000,000 - 2abc.\n\nBut we also have a + b + c = 300.

So, we have points O, A, B in the coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, √3/2). The set F is the set of all line segments PQ with unit length that lie in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any line segment in F except AB itself. Then, we need to compute OC² and find p + q where p and q are coprime positive integers. \n\nFirst, let's visualize the problem. Points O, A, B form a triangle. The set F consists of all line segments PQ with unit length, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis.

The problem is to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, roots of unity? Let me recall what that means. A 13th root of unity is a complex number \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\omega\\) over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is irreducible over the rationals. That might be useful here.\n\nFirst, let's note that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{13k} = 1\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Also, \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{26} = \\omega^{13 + 13} = \\omega^{13} \\cdot \\omega^{13} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\). Similarly, \\(\\omega^{29} = \\omega^{26 + 3} = \\omega^3\\), and so on. So, the exponents in the product are 0, 1, 2, ..., 12. Let's see if we can simplify the terms inside the product.\n\nEach term in the product is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms: \\(2(1 - \\omega^k) + \\omega^{2k}\\). So, the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} [2(1 - \\omega^k) + \\omega^{2k}]\\). Maybe we can simplify this expression inside the product first.\n\nLet me denote \\(a_k = 1 - \\omega^k\\) and \\(b_k = \\omega^{2k}\\). Then the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2a_k + b_k)\\). Let's see if we can find a pattern or a simplification here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k \\mod 13}\\). Let's compute the exponents modulo 13. For example, \\(\\omega^0 = 1\\), \\(\\omega^1 = \\omega\\), \\(\\omega^2 = \\omega^2\\), ..., \\(\\omega^{12} = \\omega^{12}\\). Then, \\(\\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k \\mod 13}\\). So, for each \\(k\\), \\(b_k = \\omega^{2k}\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2a_k + b_k)\\), where \\(a_k = 1 - \\omega^k\\). Let's compute \\(2a_k + b_k = 2(1 - \\omega^k) + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's expand this:\n\n\\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\).\n\nHmm, maybe we can relate this to some known expression. Let's see if we can factor this expression. Let's consider the expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's write it as \\(2(1 - \\omega^k) + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's see if we can express this in terms of \\(\\omega\\).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \\(\\omega^k\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\omega\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is irreducible over the rationals. So, the roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity. Let's denote the 13th cyclotomic polynomial as \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Then, the roots are \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, ..., 12\\). So, the polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\) is the product of \\((x - \\omega^k)\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, ..., 12\\).\n\nBut maybe we can relate this to the product we have. Let's consider the polynomial \\(P(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let's see if we can relate this to the polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the polynomial \\(Q(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let's try to find a relation between \\(Q(x)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Maybe we can use the fact that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{26} = \\omega^{13 + 13} = \\omega^{13} \\cdot \\omega^{13} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\). So, \\(\\omega^{26} = 1\\), and similarly, \\(\\omega^{29} = \\omega^{26 + 3} = \\omega^3\\), and so on. So, the exponents in the product are 0, 1, 2, ..., 12. Let's see if we can factor out some terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the polynomial \\(R(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let's try to find a relation between \\(R(x)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Maybe we can use the fact that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{26} = 1\\), and so on. Let's see if we can express \\(R(x)\\) in terms of \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the polynomial \\(S(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let's try to find a relation between \\(S(x)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Maybe we can use the fact that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{26} = 1\\), and so on.

Let's try to find a relation between \\(U(x)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Maybe we can use the fact that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^{26} = 1\\), and so on.

So, the problem says that we need to find the smallest integer b ≥ 2 such that there are more than 10 beautiful numbers. A beautiful number is defined as a positive integer n that can be expressed in base b with exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful number is. It's a number n that when written in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, for example, in base 13, 81 is written as 63, which has two digits. The digits here are 6 and 3. Then, the sum of these digits is 6 + 3 = 9, which equals the square root of 81, which is 9. So, 81 is beautiful because it meets the criteria.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the smallest b ≥ 2 where there are more than 10 such numbers. So, we need to find the smallest b where the number of beautiful numbers is greater than 10. The key here is to find the smallest b where the number of such numbers exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe we can model the problem in terms of the number of beautiful numbers for each base b. Then, we can find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible digits in base b. Since b is at least 2, the digits can be from 0 to b-1. However, since the number is written with exactly two digits, the first digit cannot be 0 (unless the number is 0, but 0 is not considered here). So, the first digit can be from 1 to b-1, and the second digit can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, for a given base b, the number of beautiful numbers is equal to the number of possible pairs (a, b) where a is the first digit (1 ≤ a ≤ b-1) and b is the second digit (0 ≤ b ≤ b-1). Wait, but since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for example, in base 13, the second digit can be 1, 2, ..., 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), there are 13 possible b's (0 to 12). But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0. So, for each a, the number of possible b's is 13 - 1 = 12. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Because in base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So, for example, in base 13, the digits are 0 to 12. So, for each a (from 1 to 12), the second digit can be 0 to 12. But since the number is written with two digits, the second digit can't be 0.

Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So each side is a chord of the circle that circumscribes the dodecagon. The problem says that a rectangle can be formed either by a side of the dodecagon or by a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the question is asking for the number of rectangles that can be formed by either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of a regular dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, each of length equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. The diagonals of the dodecagon can be categorized into different lengths based on the number of sides they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips 1 side is a side, a diagonal that skips 2 sides is a diagonal of length 2, and so on. Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized into different lengths based on the number of sides they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips 1 side is a side, skips 2 sides is a diagonal of length 2, skips 3 sides is a diagonal of length 3, and so on. So, the diagonals can be categorized into different lengths, and each length corresponds to a different number of sides skipped.\n\nBut the problem is asking for rectangles that can be formed by either a side or a diagonal. So, a rectangle can be formed by a side of the dodecagon, which is a chord of the circle, or by a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the problem is essentially asking for the number of rectangles that can be formed by either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.\n\nTo approach this, I need to consider the possible combinations of sides and diagonals that can form a rectangle. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. So, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and adjacent sides are also equal and parallel. So, a rectangle can be formed by two sides and two diagonals, or by two diagonals and two sides. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides and diagonals are all chords of the circle. So, a rectangle can be formed by two sides and two diagonals, or by two diagonals and two sides. But in the problem, it's asking for rectangles that can be formed by either a side or a diagonal. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. A rectangle formed by two sides and two diagonals.\n2. A rectangle formed by two diagonals and two sides.\n\nSo, the total number of rectangles would be the sum of these two possibilities.\n\nBut how do I calculate the number of such rectangles?\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of rectangles formed by two sides and two diagonals. Each such rectangle would have two sides and two diagonals. The sides are chords of the circle, and the diagonals are also chords of the circle. So, the number of such rectangles would be the number of ways to choose two sides and two diagonals such that they form a rectangle.\n\nSimilarly, the number of rectangles formed by two diagonals and two sides would be the number of ways to choose two diagonals and two sides such that they form a rectangle.\n\nSo, the total number of rectangles would be the sum of these two possibilities.\n\nBut how do I calculate the number of such rectangles?\n\nLet me start with the first case: rectangles formed by two sides and two diagonals.\n\nEach such rectangle would have two sides and two diagonals.

So, we have a list of positive integers with some specific properties. Let me list them out again to make sure I understand:\n\n1. The sum of all the numbers is 30.\n2. The unique mode is 9.\n3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.\n\nWe need to find the sum of all the squares of the numbers in the list.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem.

The example given is a 2x3 grid where 0+991=999 and 9+9+81=99. Hmm, so we need to place these numbers in such a way that the left column sums to 999 and the top row sums to 99. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grid is 2 rows and 3 columns. So, each row has 3 numbers, and each column has 2 numbers. The left column is the first two numbers in each row, and the top row is the first three numbers in each column. So, the left column is 0, 9, 8, 1 (from the first row) and 9, 9, 8 (from the second row). Similarly, the top row is 0, 9, 8, 9 (from the first column) and 9, 9, 1 (from the second column).

The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations and then finding the absolute value of a product of logarithms, which we need to express as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we have to find m + n. Hmm, let's start by understanding the given equations.\n\nFirst, the system of equations is:\n\n1. log₂(x / (yz)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y / (xz)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z / (xy)) = 1/4\n\nWe need to solve for x, y, z, and then compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. The absolute value is important because logarithms can be negative, so we need to ensure that the argument is positive. Let's see. Each of the arguments in the logarithms must be positive. So, for the first equation, x / (yz) > 0. Since x, y, z are positive, this implies that yz < 0. Similarly, for the second equation, y / (xz) > 0, so xz < 0, and for the third equation, z / (xy) > 0, so xy < 0. Therefore, all three variables must be negative. That's a crucial point. So, x, y, z are all negative.\n\nNow, let's denote each variable as negative. Let's set x = -a, y = -b, z = -c, where a, b, c are positive real numbers. Then, substituting into the equations:\n\n1. log₂((-a) / ((-b)(-c))) = 1/2\n2. log₂((-b) / ((-a)(-c))) = 1/3\n3. log₂((-c) / ((-a)(-b))) = 1/4\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1. log₂(-a / (b c)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(-b / (a c)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(-c / (a b)) = 1/4\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, but the problem states that x, y, z are positive real numbers, so the arguments must be positive. Therefore, the arguments in the logarithms must be positive. So, each of the denominators in the arguments must be positive. Therefore, b c > 0, a c > 0, a b > 0. Since a, b, c are positive, this implies that b c > 0, a c > 0, a b > 0. So, all three variables are positive. Therefore, our substitution was correct. So, x = -a, y = -b, z = -c, where a, b, c are positive real numbers. Then, the equations become:\n\n1. log₂(-a / (b c)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(-b / (a c)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(-c / (a b)) = 1/4\n\nLet's denote each logarithm as follows:\n\nLet’s set:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet’s

That means sides AB, CD, and EF are parallel. The sides of the triangle formed by these three sides have lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's regular, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. The hexagon has six sides, each of length 'a'. The sides AB, CD, and EF are parallel, so the hexagon is divided into two congruent trapezoids by these three sides.

Then Bob lists all finite non-empty subsets of positive integers that have the property that the maximum element of the subset is in A. The total number of such subsets is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in set A.\n\nHmm. Let me start by understanding the problem. Bob is creating subsets where the largest element is in A. So, for each subset, the maximum element is in A, and the subset is non-empty. The total number of such subsets is 2024. We need to find the sum of all elements in A.\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of the subsets. Since the maximum element is in A, each subset must have at least one element from A. Also, the subsets can be of any size, from 1 to the size of A. But since the subsets are non-empty, the subsets can be of size 1, 2, ..., up to the size of A. Wait, but the subsets can be of any size, but they have to include the maximum element. So, for example, if A has elements 1, 2, 3, then subsets like {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3} are all valid. But subsets like {1,2,3} is already in A, so {1,2,3} is not added again. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A. So, the subsets are all possible subsets of A, but with the maximum element being in A.

So, we have a number N that is a four-digit positive integer. The key condition is that whenever any digit of N is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. We need to find Q and R such that when N is divided by 1000, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder, and then compute Q + R.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem again. N is a four-digit number. Changing any digit to 1 should result in a number that is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is 1234, changing any digit to 1 would give 1124, 1214, 1231, etc., and all these numbers must be divisible by 7. The question is asking for Q and R when N is divided by 1000, and then Q + R.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is essentially about finding N such that for every digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we can find the quotient Q and remainder R, and sum them up.\n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of N. Since N is a four-digit number, it ranges from 1000 to 9999. Let's denote N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.\n\nNow, the condition is that for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a number that is divisible by 7. So, for each i from 0 to 3 (since N is four digits), the number formed by replacing the i-th digit with 1 is divisible by 7. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet's consider each digit position. For each digit in N, say the i-th digit (from left to right), replacing it with 1 gives a new number. Let's denote the new number as N'. So, N' = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. But wait, the original N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, replacing the i-th digit with 1 is equivalent to subtracting 1000A + 100B + 10C from N and adding 1000A + 100B + 10C. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIf we replace the i-th digit with 1, the new number is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. But the original number is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, subtracting 1000A + 100B + 10C from N gives the new number. So, N' = N - (1000A + 100B + 10C). But since N is a four-digit number, 1000A + 100B + 10C is a three-digit number (from 100 to 999). So, subtracting a three-digit number from a four-digit number would result in a number from 1000 to 9999 - 999 = 9000. But wait, N is a four-digit number, so N - (1000A + 100B + 10C) would be a number from 1000 to 9999 - 999 = 9000. But N is a four-digit number, so N - (1000A + 100B + 10C) is a number from 1000 to 9999 - 999 = 9000. But since N is a four-digit number, N - (1000A + 100B + 10C) is a number from 1000 to 9999 - 999 = 9000. But N is a four-digit number, so N - (1000A + 100B + 10C) is a number from 1000 to 9999 - 999 = 9000.

So, we have a torus T formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis in a plane 6 units away from the center of the original circle. Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus is placed on one side of the sphere S, and we need to find the difference in radii of the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side. The answer should be expressed as m/n in simplest terms, and we need to find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the original circle. So, the torus is a surface of revolution. The sphere S has radius 11, and it's placed on one side of the torus. We need to find the radii of the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side. Then, the difference between these two radii is m/n, and we need to compute m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an axis in the same plane. The distance from the center of the torus to the axis of rotation is called the major radius, and the radius of the generating circle is called the minor radius. In this problem, the major radius is 6 (since the torus is 6 units away from the center of the original circle), and the minor radius is 3. So, the torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3.\n\nNow, the sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is placed on one side of the sphere, we need to find the radii of the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S. These circles are called the tangent circles. The problem states that when the torus is on one side of the sphere, the tangent circles are on the same side of the torus as the sphere, and when the torus is on the other side, they are on the opposite side. So, the two tangent circles are on the same side when the torus is on one side, and on the opposite side when the torus is on the other side.\n\nThe difference in radii between these two tangent circles is what we need to find. The problem says that this difference can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the radii of the two tangent circles when the torus is on either side of the sphere S. Then, subtract the smaller radius from the larger one to get the difference, and express that difference as a fraction in simplest terms. Then, compute m + n.\n\nLet me recall that when a sphere is tangent to a torus, the radii of the tangent circles can be found using some geometric formulas. For a sphere tangent to a torus, the radii of the tangent circles can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIf the sphere has radius r, and the torus has major radius R and minor radius r, then the radii of the tangent circles are given by:\n\nr1 = sqrt(R² - (R - r)²) = sqrt(R² - (R² - 2Rr + r²)) = sqrt(2Rr - r²)\n\nr2 = sqrt(R² - (R + r)²) = sqrt(R² - (R² + 2Rr + r²)) = sqrt(-2Rr - r²)\n\nWait, but the formula for the radii of the tangent circles when the sphere is tangent to the torus is:\n\nr1 = sqrt(R² - (R - r)²) = sqrt(R² - (R² - 2Rr + r²)) = sqrt(2Rr - r²)\n\nr2 = sqrt(R² - (R + r)²) = sqrt(R² - (R² + 2Rr + r²)) = sqrt(-2Rr - r²)\n\nBut since the radii must be positive, we take the positive square root. So, r1 is sqrt(2Rr - r²), and r2 is sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere. Wait, but the problem states that when the torus is on one side of the sphere, the tangent circles are on the same side, and when on the other side, they are on the opposite side. So, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere when the torus is on one side, and on the opposite side when on the other side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be the same as the sphere's radius when the torus is on one side, and the negative of the sphere's radius when on the other side. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\". So, when the torus is on one side, the tangent circles are on the same side as the sphere, and when on the other side, they are on the opposite side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be the same as the sphere's radius when the torus is on one side, and the negative of the sphere's radius when on the other side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\". So, when the torus is on one side, the tangent circles are on the same side as the sphere, and when on the other side, they are on the opposite side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be the same as the sphere's radius when the torus is on one side, and the negative of the sphere's radius when on the other side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Therefore, the difference between the two radii is r1 - (-r2) = r1 + r2. But we need to compute r1 + r2. So, r1 + r2 = sqrt(2Rr - r²) + sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\". So, when the torus is on one side, the tangent circles are on the same side as the sphere, and when on the other side, they are on the opposite side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be the same as the sphere's radius when the torus is on one side, and the negative of the sphere's radius when on the other side. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Therefore, the difference between the two radii is r1 - (-r2) = r1 + r2. Therefore, the difference is r1 + r2. But we need to compute r1 + r2. So, r1 + r2 = sqrt(2Rr - r²) + sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\".

Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Therefore, the difference between the two radii is r1 - (-r2) = r1 + r2. Therefore, the difference is r1 + r2. But we need to compute r1 + r2. So, r1 + r2 = sqrt(2Rr - r²) + sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\".

Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Therefore, the difference between the two radii is r1 - (-r2) = r1 + r2. Therefore, the difference is r1 + r2. But we need to compute r1 + r2. So, r1 + r2 = sqrt(2Rr - r²) + sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere. Wait, but the problem says \"the two circles that are tangent to the sphere S when the torus is on either side\". So, when the torus is on one side, the tangent circles are on the same side as the sphere, and when on the other side, they are on the opposite side.

Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles will be r1 and -r2. Therefore, the difference between the two radii is r1 - (-r2) = r1 + r2. Therefore, the difference is r1 + r2. But we need to compute r1 + r2. So, r1 + r2 = sqrt(2Rr - r²) + sqrt(-2Rr - r²). But since the sphere is on one side of the torus, the radii of the tangent circles will be on the same side as the sphere.

So, we have 25 white and 25 black dominoes. We need to arrange them in a 5x5 grid such that each domino covers exactly one white and one black domino, and no other domino is placed. Also, the arrangement must satisfy that in any row or column, all dominoes in that row or column have the same color. Additionally, any domino placed on the grid must violate at most one of the two conditions: either the row or column has a different color, or the domino is placed in a way that breaks the color consistency in the row or column.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the 5x5 grid has 25 rows and 25 columns. Each domino covers one white and one black domino. So, the total number of dominoes is 25, which matches the given numbers. The arrangement must be such that in each row and each column, all dominoes are the same color. So, each row and each column must have all white dominoes or all black dominoes. That's a key constraint.\n\nAdditionally, any domino placed on the grid must violate at most one of the two conditions: either the row or column has a different color, or the domino is placed in a way that breaks the color consistency in the row or column.
